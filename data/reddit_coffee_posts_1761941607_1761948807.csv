I'm Jay. I'm a 31 year old lad from the Yeehaw state, as stated above. Why am I here? Same reason as you, probably - It'd be really fun to make a friend or a few, and there's not going to be any trick or treating to do or trick or treaters passing by my apartment. I spend most of my day at work which drains my battery, so having a comfy friend to talk to from the comfort of the internet would be sweet. I'm imagining the feeling of a cozy cafe with nice smelling coffee, laughs, and Nora Jones music in the background - but virtual.

If you've gotten this far, let me know what your favorite movie has been this year!

A bit more about me:  
I live at a hospital and occasionally get to visit my home when work is over. I've got some eclectic interests: I'm a decent history buff, I can talk your ear off about military aviation and space travel, I used to do a lot of high ranking competitive gaming with my friends, I try to cook a new recipe every week or two, and the list goes on. Something I'm working on doing more: taking more walks, leaving for work earlier, and picking up heavy weights and putting them down repetitively.

Look forward to hearing from ya!

Love,

Jay",1,1761948735.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1ol7qy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ol7qy3/labor_mostly_positive/,Labor (Mostly Positive!),"Hey guys! I haven’t been active in this sub in a little bit, but wanted to share some positivity for everyone. 

EDD of 10/09. On October 8th, I woke up, made my little cup of coffee, and felt something trickle down my legs in the kitchen. I was on the phone with my mom and honestly thought I had peed myself… but it wouldn’t stop. I finally told her I had to go, and texted my partner that I thought my water was broken but I wasn’t sure. He immediately called and rushed home. We gathered our stuff, I took a shower, and we got to the hospital around 9am. Waited in the waiting room for about 5 hours before they took me back. The nurse that checked me said that she was going to do a quick pelvic exam, and most likely swab to see if it was amniotic fluid. Once she lifted my blanket she knew right away that it was, in fact, amniotic fluid, and I was admitted to the hospital. 

I was only 1cm dilated. A few hours went by… still 1cm. They gave me a pill to soften my cervix to avoid having to be induced. While I was hooked up to the monitors, they mentioned that I was having pretty consistent contractions but i simply was not feeling them at all. Around 9-10pm, I was 2cm dilated. I let them know that I wanted to have the IV pain meds, they asked if I would like to have them administered that evening so I could get some sleep in case my contractions picked up. This sounded good to me, so we did it. In the morning, around 9am, they came in and checked me again, I was only 2.5cm. They were discussing with me the next dose of cervical softening and left the room. Suddenly, I felt like my uterus was going to EXPLODE. My partner was being so kind, and so insanely supportive… but I couldn’t hear it. I just kept thinking “if this is what it feels like and I’m only 2.5cm, it’s just going to get worse… I can’t do this” over and over again. I was screaming, cursing, I begged for more IV pain meds. The baby’s heart was doing some weird stuff on the monitor so they were hesitant to give it to me until she leveled out. Finally, at 10am, I asked him to go get a nurse because I couldn’t do it anymore. A nurse came in, and said they couldn’t give me the pain meds, but they could start an epidural. (I didn’t want an epidural, but in that moment I realized I just couldn’t do it). I said yes, we did the epidural which was completely painless at that point and over before I even knew it, and the relief was instant. My partner left to go grab a snack, and the nurse came in to check my cervix. In an hour, I had gone from 2.5cm to 9.5cm. She told me to call him back, and asked why nobody checked me before starting an epidural. She could SEE MY BABY’S HEAD!!! 

The epidural majorly stalled my labor. I ended up having my beautiful, amazing, healthy daughter at 2:59pm on her due date. 

My advice if you’re a first time mom:
- when you start to tell yourself “I can’t do this”, ask for a check. They are right when they say that usually means you’re RIGHT THERE. 
- you do forget the pain. Seriously… you remember how you reacted to the pain, but it’s temporary. You will get through it. 
- you do not get a medal if you give birth naturally. Do what’s right for you. I would not have elected to do the epidural if I knew how close I was, but it was not as bad as I thought it would be and recovery time was nothing. I was walking within an hour. 
- labor comb did not help me whatsoever, but I think it was my mindset. I was convinced I couldn’t do it and so I couldn’t. But breathing helps… a supportive partner helps. Prepare your partner to potentially be screamed at lol. 
- pushing a baby out… same muscles you use to poop. You’re going to poop… nobody tells you that you did, but you’ll know. And it’s FINE. It is literally part of the process. 
- tearing SUCKS, but with a second degree tear I was completely fine within the day. Pooping after birth feels like a big, daunting task, but it is NOT THAT BAD. I PROMISE. 
- The first night with your baby feels like a dream. You will have a calm, beautiful little thing to stare at all night. You will go home in a cloud of dopamine and peace and gratitude. The second night, once your home, is NOT so pleasant. Baby will be awake, and screaming, and hungry. Your supply isn’t in yet… they’re getting tiny bits of colostrum and they want A LOT. You’ll cry, your partner will cry. It’s part of the process. You’re doing great… it’s normal. 
- your baby may struggle to latch. Lactation consultants are great… but really do your research and determine what is best for you and your family. I breast fed for the first week, and my supply just wouldn’t increase. We started supplementing with formula and now we are completely on formula. All of us are happier, baby is surpassing her milestones. Everything is okay. 

I know this is long… but I remember how scared I was. There are so many negative stories online. I promise it is not always scary. You have to get the baby out somehow. ",1,1761948641.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

He’s been acting really weird for a long time. Been with him long enough to know when something is not right. He fell asleep and left his phone unlocked, usually he guards that phone like it’s made of gold so that suspicious. Something told me I needed to look. I opened up a message from her and found a long text thread with my 38-year-old daughter which included naked photos of her and him, very nasty disgusting text to her detailing things he wanted to do to her…again! She responded in kind. One thing you need to know is I don’t speak to my oldest daughter any longer because she is heavily on drugs and has threatened to kill her younger sister a few years ago. I had to put a restraining order out on her and renew it every year. This has been going on for a while. When she was 12 years old her grandmother contacted CPS stating that he raped her but I didn’t believe them and I backed him up and nothing came of it. Now I believe this has been going on not long after that. Am I wrong to think that this is extremely disgusting and immoral?! I confronted him and he said that he was seeing her now because I couldn’t have sex with him any longer. I have a collapsed uterus and cannot have intercourse any longer. I’ve also had six back surgeries in the last four years and suffer from RA, heart disease and osteoporosis. I’m 58 years old and I have taken care of him like any good wife would. I bring him coffee every morning when I wake him up, I wash his clothes, fold them and put them away for him, I make sure his dinner is cooked and on time and make sure that all of his favorite snacks and such are readily available. Am I wrong for being absolutely shook by what I have just found out. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to say. He says he’s justified and then I’m just gonna have to deal with it.

•	Belém - 10 days (mostly work in the COP30 Blue Zone, minimal tourist activities)

•	Transport (Uber / metro / occasional taxi)

Today the Lightning Building lowers the intensity of its thunder.
We let the electrical currents rest. We turned off, for a moment, our surveillance systems. Today there is no interference or conspiracy: just the echo of something ancient that still touches us.

love

Between cables and holograms, we pause.
We leave dark fiction aside to immerse ourselves in this brutal contrast:

→ The love of before and the love of now  
→ Love with a body and love with a screen  
→ The love that went up to the sky for a star  
→ And the one that goes out today with a ""seen""

Lightning, for once, does not strike.

Breathe.

And invites you to read and reflect 



I was able to go up to the sky to bring down a lot of stars.
And it was not a metaphor: it was an act.
Love was a verb with weight,
a sustained decision,
fine, artisanal work,
one of those that were made with the hands, the body and waiting.
The love of before, that of the old guard,
It didn't ask for more than a glance to start writing destiny.
There wasn't much to say:
It was enough to know that that was the person.
And then the dance began:
the message with pulse,
the date with nerve,
the coffee that lasted longer than the clock,
the nights when one stayed awake,
although the other was already sleeping,
because loving was also watching over someone else's dream.
That love resisted.
Even in the most critical moments.
Even when it hurt.
Because it wasn't a game.
It was a pact.
And you didn't delete a pact with a click.
But something changed.
The sky is now a hologram.
Stars are pixels.
And love slips away. Literal.
Towards the right.
Towards the ephemeral.
Today you love with fireworks.
With fire.
With intermittent connection.
There is no need for courage, silence, or dedication:
signal is needed.
A good camera.
And want to play for a while.
Afterwards, nothing.
Courtship became an algorithm.
Sex, an empty promise wrapped in emojis.
Desire is consumed quickly,
like a social media story before noon.
And in that emptiness disguised as freedom,
the question remains floating:
Who dares to go up to heaven again,
even if it's alone,
to lower a real star?
Just because.
Sometimes,
true love is still up there.
But you have to look.
And stay.


(For those who have ever gone up to the sky to look for stars)

1ol7hwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JFerzt/comments/1ol7hwf/when_lazy_code_meets_open_registration_the_wp/,When Lazy Code Meets Open Registration: The WP Freeio Collapse,"You want a master class in how privilege escalation isn't even hard work anymore? Watch a freelance marketplace plugin hand admin access to literally *anyone* who knows how to fill out a registration form like a normal person.

WP Freeio .. that slick plugin bundled with the Freeio theme for freelancers who wanna cosplay Upwork without the development overhead .. shipped with a registration function so gutted it's basically fraud dressed as software. The process\_register() function, the one that's supposed to *validate* what role you get when you sign up, just .. doesn't. At all. It lets unauthenticated strangers specify their role during registration, and if you type ""administrator"" in that field? Boom. You own the site. Full stop.

CVE-2025-11533. CVSS 9.8. The kind of score that makes security folks reach for their coffee before noon.

Wordfence flagged this disaster on September 25th when some researcher reported it. The vendor .. ApusThemes .. patched it October 9th. Responsible timeline, right? Except attackers didn't wait for an invitation. The *same day* Wordfence disclosed it publicly, October 10th, people started swinging at this thing. Over 33,200 exploit attempts blocked in the first week alone. And that's just the Wordfence firewall. God knows what slipped through the gaps.

The IPs doing the heavy lifting? AWS boxes, mostly .. cloud infrastructure that spins up, does the job, and vanishes like smoke. [35.178.249.28](http://35.178.249.28) racked up 1,500+ blocked requests solo. These aren't script kiddies fumbling around. This is industrial-scale exploitation. Mass registration campaigns. Automated shit that doesn't care if *this* site works .. just that *some* site doesn't have Wordfence running.

Here's where it gets raw: the vulnerability lives because nobody in that development process asked the question that matters. ""What if the user just .. lies about their role?"" No input validation. No capability checks. No sanity. The registration form trusts the browser like the browser's your buddy from high school. And the plugin swallows whatever you feed it whole.

Once an attacker's got admin, the playground's unlimited. Upload malicious plugins with backdoors baked in. Redirect users to fake sites where they get skinned of credentials or infected. Mod the site content so it's spam city or a redirect farm. Or just sit quiet in the background, collecting data, waiting for the real money moves. A site's completely compromised, and if nobody's looking at logs .. most aren't .. it keeps breathing like nothing happened.

The patch, version 1.2.22, finally *restricts* role assignment. Meaning they had to add code that says ""no, actually, you can't just pick your role."" That's how broken the original was. And sure, the vendor moved quick, but 1,700+ theme sales means thousands of sites still out there running 1.2.21. Because updates? Most of these shop owners don't do regular maintenance. They set it and forget it like a frozen dinner.

What eats at the real problem though .. it's not just this plugin. It's the mentality baked into WordPress culture. ""Users can't hurt anything, right? They're just registering."" Developers cutting corners on privilege boundaries because validation feels like extra work. And the ecosystem? Full of plugins for sale that shipped before anyone took security seriously. Now the debt's come due, and attackers are collecting interest.

The free version of Wordfence won't even get protection until November 7th .. 30 days later. That's the industry's dirty compromise: paying customers get shields first, everybody else waits. So the smallest shops, the freelancers running zero-budget marketplaces who *most need* security? They get the slowest protection rollout.

Wordfence blocked 33,200 attempts because they *caught* the pattern. But how many sites don't have Wordfence? How many of those Freeio theme buyers are now admin'd by someone in some AWS region, completely unaware they've got a ghost in the machine? Nobody's counting that.

You think about that .. and you realize the real vulnerability wasn't in the code. It was in the assumption that unauthenticated users couldn't be a threat. That assumption's been dead weight for years .. and it only got exposed because someone bothered to test what nobody else wanted to admit was possible.",1,1761947966.0,u_JFerzt,0,1.0,False

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.

Tools are your best friend. I use the normal notes app on my phone to write down gratitudes and other things on my mind all the time. For planning my day, I use a tool which lets me turn a voice message into a full plan. I put the tools in my profile for anyone interested.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

His great-grandfather had fallen at Gettysburg in 1863, leading the First Minnesota Regiment, nearly wiped out in that suicidal charge against the Confederates.

His father, a veteran of the Great War, had fought in the Meuse-Argonne offensive, returning home with an eye patch and medals that reeked of iron, blood, and honor. Life’s cruel irony: he survived the trenches of hell only to die a few years later, in 1927, from a ridiculous fever.

Steve lived with his mother and his four-year-old sister in Springfield, Illinois—heartland America—supported by the modest state pension left by his father’s service. It was just enough to live with dignity: a small house, a trimmed garden, and a flag always clean on the porch.

Then came the great day: **September 19, 1943.** Steve enlisted the moment he turned eighteen.

That morning, his mother treated him like it was Christmas: fried eggs and bacon, pancakes dripping with honey, jam, and coffee fresh from the pot. She walked him to the door, eyes wet, arms trembling.

“Come back in one piece, Stevie… we’re proud of you.”

He was about to board the military bus when she called out again, her voice breaking:

“Stevie, wait!”

She took from her pocket a small silver chain—his father’s name and blood type engraved on it, the same as his. She placed it in his palm, closed his fist, and whispered:

“So he’ll protect you from above. You’re all I have left of him.”

Before climbing aboard, Steve turned to look at the house. His mother stood frozen, tears fogging her eyes.  
Above the roof, the Stars and Stripes fluttered gently—solemn, disciplined. That flag had never been taken down except to be washed.

Training was brutal: crawling through mud, barbed wire overhead, scaling walls, dragging half-dead comrades across endless circuits.

In the barracks, he shared a room with dozens of boys—some volunteers, others drafted. Some prayed, some smoked while staring at pictures of naked women, and a few wrote letters to their girls back home. Steve lay on his side, staring at the wall, drowning in thought.

By **January 14, 1944**, his company boarded the *SS George Washington*, escorted by carriers, destroyers, and frigates. The Atlantic crossing lasted two weeks: violent seas, cabins that stank of vomit and sweat, showers reserved for officers. The rest slept in their gear, afraid of the unseen torpedo of a U-boat.

Desperate for air, Steve stepped on deck. He froze at the sight—an ocean crowded with transport ships surrounded by warships, all bearing scars of bullets, shells, explosions.  
British and American flags—tattered, patched, grimy—fluttered side by side like old friends marching toward hell… and victory.

That was when he understood: this wasn’t a game of cards or a boxing match.  
He was going to a **fucking war.**

He pulled out a crumpled cigarette pack, lit one, inhaled deep. For a moment, he just wanted to breathe something that didn’t smell like smoked humanity.  
As the smoke left his lungs, a thought hit him: *If I die, the only trace left will be my name in a newspaper casualty list—an elegant way of saying your son’s body is rotting somewhere in Europe, or worse, blown to pieces.*

Then came the thunder overhead—a roar of engines. Looking up, he saw an enormous swarm of fighters and bombers flying escort, freshly launched from nearby carriers. He knew then: the Allies were preparing something big… and bloody.

By late January, they arrived in Portsmouth, England. From there, the troops boarded a military train bound for Wiltshire—rolling hills and waterlogged fields under a gray sky that seemed permanently drafted into service.

After months of parachute drills in the dark, Steve and his men knew something colossal was coming. They just didn’t know what or where. The secret lay buried in the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force—SHAEF—under General Dwight D. Eisenhower.  
The concentration of tanks, planes, and men left no doubt: whatever it was, it would be biblical.

That night, Steve lay on his cot and reread, for the hundredth time, his mother’s last letter:

“Stevie, wherever you are—be it Italy or England—know that I say my prayers each night with tears of fear but also of pride.  
We’re all proud of your courage, following your father’s path so bravely at the end of the Great War.  
I just hope this one ends soon so I can hold you again and spoil you with that beef stew you love.

PS: Don’t eat chocolate before combat—you know what it does to you.  
With endless love,

Mom.”

He kissed the letter, folded it, and tucked it into the pocket over his heart. Then he closed his eyes, unaware that by tomorrow night he would be written into history.

  


**June 5, 1944.**  
The men of the 101st Screaming Eagles were tense. Bad weather had delayed the mission the day before. They spent the day packing their fifty-kilo kits—rifles, grenades, explosives, rations, canteens.

At 10 p.m., the order came: **board the planes.**  
Eisenhower’s message was simple: *We go.* No turning back now.

Steve climbed into the C-47, heart pounding. Around him, soldiers crossed themselves, muttered prayers, kissed crucifixes, Stars of David, or photos of their families—as if God had taken sides.  
Steve prayed too, not for glory, just to keep his mother from suffering.

The engines roared to life—two 14-cylinder Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasps, 2,400 horses each. The metal beast trembled under the strain. The noise was so deafening it wrung the piss out of some of the men. The stench—urine, metal, fear, and the faint reek of someone who’d lost control of his bowels—filled the fuselage.

Steve looked out the window for calm.  
“Shouldn’t we be crossing the Channel by now?” he yelled.

His buddy’s reply froze his blood:  
“We are. Those lights down there—it’s the fleet. The whole goddamn invasion.”

Seven thousand ships.

Not a city—an armada. The largest fleet ever assembled by man, poised for the greatest landing in history. At dawn, the world would change.

He looked up: not one plane, not ten, not a hundred—**thousands.** A black swarm moving in perfect formation like migrating birds, except these carried twenty-three thousand souls.  
It was power in its purest form: the Allied war machine at full throttle.

Steve couldn’t tell if what twisted in his gut was terror or pride. He realized he wasn’t just watching history—he *was* history.

He and his brothers were to parachute behind enemy lines, disarm the charges that would blow the bridges. One mistake, and the whole invasion would collapse.

He pressed his mother’s letter against his chest again, warm over his heart.  
Maybe that would be enough.

For nearly a year, Steve and the men who survived fought across Europe. Two million followed. They bled, they suffered, and they won.

Few remember their names. But their deaths became the marble pillars of freedom—each one a silent hymn to courage.

They paid for peace with their blood.  
They paid for prosperity with their guts.  
They paid for glory with their lives.

History gave them a name:

I just came across an interesting news piece about Ethiopia’s most famous ancient residents — Lucy and Selam. After an exhibition in Prague that drew record visitors, they are now returning home to Ethiopia.

Read more here [https://www.praguedaily.news/2025/10/31/lucy-and-selam-return-to-ethiopia-record-visit-at-the-national-museum-in-prague/](https://www.praguedaily.news/2025/10/31/lucy-and-selam-return-to-ethiopia-record-visit-at-the-national-museum-in-prague/)

It’s amazing how much global attention these 3.2-million- and 3.3-million-year-old fossils continue to receive.

For many travelers, Lucy is the main reason they want to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.

As someone who organizes guided city tours in Addis Ababa, I often see how visitors light up when they finally stand in front of Lucy’s fossils and learn about her discovery at Hadar. It’s not just a museum visit — it’s a deep look into our shared human story.

If you’re planning a trip and want ideas for seeing the city beyond the museum, feel free to ask — happy to share local tips.

1ol74d4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ol74d4,Halloween Adventures in Norway 🎃🎃🇳🇴,"Our long-awaited Halloween trip finally came about — this time, to Norway, another destination ticked off our bucket list!

With a later-than-usual flight ✈️ and the clocks going back an hour ⏰, our sleep pattern was a little off. After some rest and last-minute packing, we ordered a taxi to the airport. However, due to road closures for the marathon, we had to walk a short distance to meet our driver — who thankfully got us to the airport safely and on time.

Before we knew it, we were through security, browsing duty free, and comfortably settled near our gate with some food and drinks. Boarding was smooth and punctual, and soon we were airborne. Thanks to favorable winds, we arrived in Oslo early and disembarked ahead of schedule, which allowed us to catch the next available train into the city center.

We got off at Nationaltheatret Station, just three stops from the airport, and decided to explore a bit before checking into our hotel. Our first sights included Karl Johans Gate, Oslo’s main street, as well as the grounds of the Royal Palace, the National Theater, and the Parliament.

After a good stroll, we made our way to the hotel for a smooth self check-in — a quick and easy process. Once settled, we charged our devices, unpacked, hydrated, and set out again in the fading daylight to explore more of the city.

Several attractions were within walking distance, such as the Old City Hall (venue for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony), the nearby Nobel Peace Centre, and Rådhusplassen, the City Hall Square.

As night fell, we wandered towards Akershus Castle and Fortress (Akershus Slott og Festning), which offered beautiful panoramic views of the city lights and harbor.

To wrap up our first day in Oslo, we made our way to the famous Tiger 🐯 Sculpture near Central Station before heading to The Dubliner for food and drinks. We then returned to our hotel to relax and unwind while watching the Mexican F1 Grand Prix — the perfect end to Day 1 of our Nordic adventure.

Day 2 – Exploring the Charms of Oslo 🇳🇴

After a well-earned rest and a leisurely lie-in, it was time to continue our exploration of Oslo. We started the morning with some much-needed espresso and a hearty breakfast before hopping aboard our guided city highlights tour.

Our tour guide, Anita, was absolutely fantastic — funny, knowledgeable, and full of fascinating stories about Oslo’s history and landmarks. Our driver, Michael, navigated the city smoothly as we began our adventure with a panoramic view of the city’s main attractions.

Next on the itinerary was a visit to the stunning Holmenkollen Ski Jump, where we enjoyed breathtaking, bird’s-eye views over Oslo and its surrounding landscapes. After descending back into the city, we explored the impressive Vigeland Sculpture Park, learning about the life and extraordinary work of Gustav Vigeland, the artist behind this monumental collection.

To conclude our highlights tour, we spent a relaxing afternoon on a two-hour cruise around Oslo’s harbor, marina, and the scenic Oslo Fjord. The journey took us through beautiful bays and inlets, with a brief stop at Museum Island before returning to our starting point.

To finish off our second day in Oslo, we strolled along Aker Brygge, a lively area filled with shops, restaurants, and a charming waterfront pier. We couldn’t resist treating ourselves to some delicious food and cocktails at @jarmanngastropub — the perfect way to end the day.

As the evening came to a close, we headed back to our hotel to repack for our next adventure: a flight ✈️ to Tromsø, the magical city in Northern Norway, above the Arctic Circle. 🌌

 Tromsø – The Paris of the North and Our Arctic Adventure ❄️✨

Next on our Norwegian adventure was a two-night stay in the Paris of the North — Tromsø, a vibrant Arctic city perched at 69° north, about 350 kilometers above the Arctic Circle.

Flying domestically in Norway was refreshingly easy — stress-free and simple. All we needed were our boarding passes, and before long we were in the air for our 90-minute flight from Oslo to Tromsø. I couldn’t help but stare out the window, completely mesmerized by the view as we crossed the Arctic Circle.

Before we knew it, we were touching down in Tromsø! I did have a minor mishap — having to knock on the plane door to retrieve something I’d left behind (oops!) — but soon enough we were through the small, efficient airport and hopping on the bus into the city.

Once we disembarked, we made our way to what we thought was our hotel… only to realize we’d gone to the wrong one! 😅 After a quick reroute through the charming main street, we finally arrived at the right spot. Once checked in, unpacked, and recharged (both ourselves and our devices!), it was time to find some grub before our Northern Lights tour later that evening.

We’d spotted a restaurant called Epic earlier in the day, and decided to give it a try — especially after Niamh noticed Reindeer Burger on the menu. She ordered it and declared it succulent and something she’d definitely have again, while I couldn’t help but think… poor Sven. 🦌

Later that evening, we boarded our Northern Lights tour bus, which took us about an hour outside the city in search of clear skies and aurora activity. For a while, we saw only a faint flicker — and nearly gave up hope — when suddenly, the sky exploded in color. Dancing ribbons of green and purple shimmered across the night. It was utterly magical and worth every minute of waiting. 🌌

Returning to Tromsø late that night, we weren’t ready to call it a day just yet. We wandered around the harbor, snapping funny photos and soaking in the peaceful Arctic stillness before heading back to the hotel well past 1 a.m.

⸻

A Leisurely Day in the Arctic City ☕️

The next morning was all about a late, lazy breakfast before heading out to explore. First on the list was a hike up to Tromsø Utsiktspunkt, a hidden gem above the city that offers incredible panoramic views. The crisp air and snowy trails made it feel like something out of a storybook.

Back down in the city, we checked out a few local highlights — Tromsø Cathedral, the Roald Amundsen Monument, and Eidis Hansen Rock — before stopping for a coffee break at Risø Mat & Kaffebar. Their espresso cake and drip coffee were just what we needed to warm up and refuel.

We spent the afternoon hunting down Tromsø’s amazing street art, before taking the scenic walk across the Tromsø Bridge to the Arctic Cathedral. The views from there were stunning! Feeling adventurous, we continued up the Sherpa’s Trail for a higher vantage point. Let’s just say… I learned the hard way how slippery Arctic ice can be. Thankfully, only my pride was bruised. 😅

After a safe descent and a walk back across the bridge, we relaxed at the hotel before heading out for our final evening in Tromsø. Dinner was at Pastafabrikken, a cozy Italian spot — and on our walk there, we were treated to another surprise burst of Northern Lights right by the harbor!

We couldn’t have planned it better if we tried. 🌠

To wrap up our stay, we visited the Magic Ice Bar, an incredible ice lounge filled with crystal-clear ice sculptures and chilled cocktails served in glasses made of ice. It was freezing, yes, but such a fun, surreal experience.

And on our stroll back to the hotel — as if Tromsø wanted to give us one last gift — the aurora appeared again, dancing faintly in the sky. It was the perfect ending to our Arctic adventure. 💚

Next stop: Bergen — the gateway to Norway’s longest and deepest fjord! 🇳🇴🌊

Day 5 – Bergen Bound 🇳🇴

On the morning of Day 5 of our Nordic adventure, we were both grateful we’d packed the night before — neither of us wanted to leave our cozy bed. Still, we had enough time to enjoy breakfast before checking out and heading to catch our bus to the airport, which we timed perfectly.

There was a slight queue at security, but we breezed through in no time. Before long, we were boarding our plane ✈️ for our next destination — Bergen. We were flying on an Embraer 290 aircraft and had our row to ourselves. The 1 hour 45 minute flight treated us to incredible views of the fjords as we descended into Bergen Airport.

Continuing our streak of perfect timing, we caught the Airport Express bus just as it arrived, which dropped us close to our hotel, conveniently located near the harbor and fish market (Torget).

As we spotted Bergen Cathedral in the distance, we joked, “Bet our hotel is right next to that — maybe we’ll even have a view from our room.” Of course, that turned out to be true!

We were a bit early for check-in, but since it was a self-check-in process, we decided to give it a go — and it worked perfectly. After unpacking and recharging everything (as per usual), we made a plan to explore the city while there was still daylight.

First on the agenda: coffee — specifically, a much-needed double espresso from Kaffemisjonen, an award-winning coffee shop known for its brews. Once refueled, we wandered along Bryggen, the medieval wharf in the historic harbor district famous for its colorful wooden boathouses.

From there, we continued toward the 13th-century Bergenhus Fortress, enjoying sweeping views of the harbor.

After a leisurely stroll, we tackled the steep zig-zagging hike toward the Mirador viewpoint. The climb was worth every step — we were rewarded with panoramic views of the entire city just as the sun was setting. With the daylight fading and travel fatigue setting in, we decided to descend and continue exploring the city itself.

We wandered through the streets, admiring statues, plazas, and landmarks such as the Ludvig Holberg statue, Sailor’s Monument, The National Stage, Edvard Grieg statue, and even tried (unsuccessfully) to locate the Gestapomuseet — despite standing right near it outside Finnegan’s Bar and The National Stage.

Re-evaluating our route at the Henrik Ibsen statue, we walked toward Festplassen (“The Party Place”), a lively public square featuring the Ole Bull fountain and Musikkpaviljongen. The park offered lovely views over Lille Lungegårdsvann lake, home to art installations like the Steel Sculpture of King Olav Kyrre, Byge (which displays real-time weather data), and Sprøytegutten.

Our exploration continued past the KODE Art Museum toward St. John’s Church, Bergen’s highest. Unfortunately, it was under full restoration, but it did give us another great vantage point over the city.

We strolled down to Torgallmenningen, Bergen’s main square, and decided it was time for food. We settled on Egon restaurant near the harbor, chatting about the city, the sights, and our plans for the next day.

Before calling it a night, Niamh’s curiosity got the better of her — we made one final stop to check out the Leprosy Hospital, rounding off another full day of adventure.

 Day 6 🇳🇴- Bergen : Fjords, Coffee & Halloween Magic 🎃

The morning of our first full day in Bergen started slowly — our hotel room was toasty and cozy, making it hard to leave the warmth. Once we finally got up and ready for the day ahead, our first mission was to locate the meeting point for our Nordic fjord cruise later that morning. But before that, priorities: coffee.

We stumbled upon a quaint little café tucked in the heart of Bryggen Wharf called Kaf Kafe, where the scent of freshly baked pastries drifted through the crisp air. Over steaming cups of coffee and a delicious Kanelboller (Norwegian cinnamon bun), we watched the quiet bustle of the historic harbor come to life.

Soon after, we took the short stroll toward the pier for our 3.5-hour fjord cruise from Bergen to Modalen. The journey through the fjords was nothing short of breathtaking — gliding through still waters framed by towering cliffs and waterfalls. We sailed under the impressive Nordhordland Bridge, passed the serene Lonevåg Fjord on the island of Osterøy, and marveled at how the fjord seems to end abruptly right in the middle of the island.

The cruise continued toward Romarheim, the final branch of the fjord, before reaching Mostraumen — once the furthest point boats could travel. Thanks to a man-made canal, vessels can now continue all the way to the end of Mofjorden, offering an unforgettable journey through one of Norway’s most striking fjord landscapes.

Returning to Bergen’s harbor, we were ready to explore more of the city. We wandered over to Skostredet, the hip and artsy quarter of Bergen, where I had what might be the best double espresso of the trip. Niamh also couldn’t resist a gingerbread dark hot chocolate (70%) winter warmer special from Fjåk, a local craft chocolatier. As we sipped, the sound of “Whiskey in the Jar” and “The Wild Rover” filled the air, played by a street musician — a perfect soundtrack to the moment.

From Skostredet, we walked toward Festplassen, finally seeing the Christian Michelsen Statue we had missed the previous evening in the dark. From there, we strolled on to Knøsesmauet Alley on the Nordnes Peninsula — a narrow, cobblestoned lane lined with colorful wooden houses. It’s often said to be one of Bergen’s most beautiful streets, and it’s easy to see why.

We continued along the peninsula to the viewpoint at the very end, where we found Heksestein (The Witch Stone) — a quiet memorial dedicated to the victims of the witch trials in the 16th and 17th centuries.

On our walk back toward the city center, we stumbled upon the Magic Ice Bar — fully decorated for Halloween 🎃. Naturally, we couldn’t resist stepping inside. Sitting among shimmering ice sculptures with a drink in hand was a surprisingly cozy way to spend Halloween evening in Norway.

For dinner, we returned to the harbor and debated where to eat before settling on Porto 13, a cozy Italian restaurant. We savored delicious pizza, pasta, and cocktails — the perfect ending to a day filled with fjords, history, and a touch of Halloween magic.

Back at the hotel, we enjoyed a quiet, relaxing evening — our last night in beautiful Bergen and our farewell to Norway 🇳🇴.",1,1761946941.0,u_CharmingElephant88,0,1.0,False

Something as simple as a comment can cause me to feel like I have a reason to be concerned. 

I feel like people have intentions to either; manipulate me, cause me problems in my life, or affect my day in a negative way intentionally. 

Something as simple as a frown pulled while making eye contact with someone can cause a flood of thoughts in my mind. 

I start to think that the person is out to cause me some kind of damage, I never have evidence to the contrary, so I justify my thoughts and then believe them to be true and it amplifies as the day goes on. 

I miss out on so many things because I feel like people are constantly judging me or are planning to ridicule me. 

Be it; taking up a new sport, having a coffee with a friend, playing in the park with my daughters, speaking with colleagues, talking to other parents, to teachers etc etc. 

I try to avoid all of these things as I believe I will eventually be made to feel awful by those around me, it is like they will find a way to belittle me or they have intentions to embarrass me, sometimes it can be even worse like they have some kind of big plan to destroy my life. It’s unbearable at times.

What can also happen is I make connections with things that have no connection… E.g. a look towards me or a comment made to me becomes inflated in my mind and then I may have another interaction later in the day with a similar thought response and it adds fuel to the fire of paranoia during that day and it continues to grow after each no encounter, by lunch time, the world is out to do me harm.

These unconnected connections cause me come to a conclusion along the lines of “they want to make it look like I am ‘x’ or that I did ‘y’ and that’s why they said that, thats why they looked at me like that” 

How can I stop this, what can be done to truly remove this from my life? 

It is not all of the time, but it is most of the time. Some days are worse than others. So it’s nearly always there and some days it is more severe. 

It’s really difficult to explain this to people so am hoping to find a community on here where it is of interest or those who can have had similar can share their stories of winning the battle. 

I hope that a forum such as this one could help me think my way out of this problem. I’m 37 and feel like I have felt like this since I was about 9 or 10. ",0,1761946823.0,psychoanalysis,2,0.5,False

Today the Lightning Building lowers the intensity of its thunder.
We let the electrical currents rest. We turned off, for a moment, our surveillance systems. Today there is no interference or conspiracy: just the echo of something ancient that still touches us.

love

Between cables and holograms, we pause.
We leave dark fiction aside to immerse ourselves in this brutal contrast:

→ The love of before and the love of now  
→ Love with a body and love with a screen  
→ The love that went up to the sky for a star  
→ And the one that goes out today with a ""seen""

Lightning, for once, does not strike.

Breathe.

And invites you to read and reflect 



I was able to go up to the sky to bring down a lot of stars.
And it was not a metaphor: it was an act.
Love was a verb with weight,
a sustained decision,
fine, artisanal work,
one of those that were made with the hands, the body and waiting.
The love of before, that of the old guard,
It didn't ask for more than a glance to start writing destiny.
There wasn't much to say:
It was enough to know that that was the person.
And then the dance began:
the message with pulse,
the date with nerve,
the coffee that lasted longer than the clock,
the nights when one stayed awake,
although the other was already sleeping,
because loving was also watching over someone else's dream.
That love resisted.
Even in the most critical moments.
Even when it hurt.
Because it wasn't a game.
It was a pact.
And you didn't delete a pact with a click.
But something changed.
The sky is now a hologram.
Stars are pixels.
And love slips away. Literal.
Towards the right.
Towards the ephemeral.
Today you love with fireworks.
With fire.
With intermittent connection.
There is no need for courage, silence, or dedication:
signal is needed.
A good camera.
And want to play for a while.
Afterwards, nothing.
Courtship became an algorithm.
Sex, an empty promise wrapped in emojis.
Desire is consumed quickly,
like a social media story before noon.
And in that emptiness disguised as freedom,
the question remains floating:
Who dares to go up to heaven again,
even if it's alone,
to lower a real star?
Just because.
Sometimes,
true love is still up there.
But you have to look.
And stay.

We talked about ourselves, family, and friends. 

We grabbed a couple beers, walked around, and ended up at Starbucks. I got a coffee, she didn’t. While we were sitting there, I noticed a bug crawling on her shoulder, brushed it off, stepped on it, and cleaned it up. She smiled at me like she couldn’t decide if it was awkward or sweet, and we kept talking.

It was cold outside so she asked me if she could  sit close to me on a bench. I said, ""Sure."" She cuddled we up next to me and I put my arm around her and rubbed her arm. After a couple of minutes she leaned back out and faced me. She continued the conversation  touching my knee on occasion, and saying she was going over her friends after to talk about how things went tonight.  When we got to her car, I opened the door, I kissed her few times,  and I got her number. She said, ""Make sure you wend me yours."" I said, ""I will..promise😉"" and gave her a quick kiss. She joked I tasted like coffee. I drove away thinking, “Wow, that chemistry was amazing. I really liked her!"" 

I texted to make sure she got home, and she replied: “I did. Thanks so much for your time tonight. It was nice meeting you.” Which threw me off — sounded like a polite goodbye. I kept my response simple, and didn’t get a reply this morning. It was a great date and things got close fast, so maybe I’m overthinking and she’s waiting for the next move… or maybe she got spooked. Either way, I’m trying not to read too much into it yet. But, historically when I get the ""it was nice meeting you."" Text..thats a subtle way of saying I'm not continuing. Does it seem like she's spooked and backing away, or it was a polite, neutral response?",3,1761946677.0,dating,6,1.0,False
1ol70hy,https://v.redd.it/5e8f8ebnkiyf1,the bypass to obsession - a little behavior analysis / theory with receipts,"**Disclaimer:** *Grab a cup of coffee or tea if you wanna, this is a little deep dive. I put all the receipts in a video cause there was no other way to combine pictures and videos in one post, so it’s best to read the text and watch and pause the video to view each attached piece of evidence separately. I hope the video quality is high enough lol.* 

  
**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

  


We all know Jillian craves for her man to be obsessed with her. She’s liked reels, and reposted tweets that all convey a clear message. (**exhibit A**)



She also defined herself multiple times through loving intensely and deeply, and wanting these things to be mutual, on a level where it’s borderline concerning. (**exhibit B**)



That deeply romanticizing, all consuming mindset about a relationship feels unhealthy and unrealistic.



She also obviously thrives on being seen and heard, and on people worshipping her in general. (*feeding heavily into the parasocial behavior of Vinnies audience and encouraging the obsessive behavior towards her,* **exhibit D**) 



All in all, it seems like she's trying to fill a void, maybe to compensate for a lack of self love or a lack of control, a lack of feeling seen / chosen in the past or in childhood. (*divorced parents, a lot of instability growing up,* **exhibit C**, *source:* [*https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wwFTqyj\_bNQ&t=1571s&pp=ygUKZ296YSB0d2lucw%3D%3D*](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wwFTqyj_bNQ&t=1571s&pp=ygUKZ296YSB0d2lucw%3D%3D)) 



We also know Vinnie is nonchalant final boss, so he’s the direct opposite of what Jillian expressed she‘s looking for in a partner. (*don’t think we need receipts for that, lmao.*)



Not only that, but the other way around Vinnie has voiced being uncomfortable by obsessive behavior towards him multiple times in the past with other girls (*Julia, Renata*, **exhibit E**). So Jillians personality and behavior pattern is alarmingly similar to those of girls who caused him trauma in the past.



So judging by these observations, it goes both ways, they’re equally not each other's ideal counterpart.



It seems like they‘re more in love with the idea of each other than the actual reality. Even on social media, there‘s more evidence of them escaping reality together than of them being present with each other. (*The partying, the smoking and drinking, Vinnie being high on stream and possibly during date nights, or them being on their phones and commenting on each others posts like they‘re rather complimenting each other online than face to face.*)



So they’re trying to ignore the reality and make it work regardless. 



In Vinnies case, he’s running with it now because his reputation is on the line. He has claimed her so loudly and so publicly, he’s never done that before with any other girl. He has to run with that for a while now so it doesn't look embarrassing for him.



In Jillians case, she’s running with it because obviously, Vinnie brings something else to the table that makes up for his lack of obsession towards her;



**His parasocial audience and the attention it brings her.** 



Because unlike Vinnie, these people are very likely to obsess over her loudly and publicly, if she gives them just the tiniest amount of positive attention and reinforcement. 👀



So, she was quick to build a **bypass** around nonchalant Vinnie to get her fix from his intense fans instead. She formed a parasocial connection to them as quickly as possible (*her work livestreams, literally memorizing names and complimenting and reposting edits about her*), making them feel like they’re besties and entitled to have an insight into their relationship, conveniently not establishing any boundaries with them. (*unlike Vinnie, who literally scolded his entire audience for the exact behavior.*)



Because it was obvious a lot of them would put her on a pedestal just for being with Vinnie, even without her having to provide anything of substance. **The identity of ‚Vinnies girlfriend‘ is enough.** (*No wonder she hasn’t shown anything more personal yet and hasn‘t put in much effort into building her own brand. So far, she seems to mostly be a mirror of the people around her - her sister & Vinnie…*) 



So now there she is, basking in the superficial attention and obsession towards her that she never got in her past (**exhibit F**).



Like it’s real and is gonna fill some void or last in any way longer than this misaligned relationship. 



But she’s in for a rude awakening once things go downhill and those exact people drop her just as quickly as they put her on a pedestal. 



**Because it was never about her to begin with, and it was never organically achieved.**  





The ironic thing is, by being so hungry for it all, she played herself. If she was more low-key about a lot of things since the beginning, people would have developed genuine, REAL interest in her as a person, and even them as a possible new couple. But with how ‚in your face‘ she’s been and is with everything, people are gonna get desensitized to it, they’ll get bored and roll their eyes. **They already are.** 



You literally could’ve teased and marketed a relationship 100 times better by dropping little hints and letting people ship you first, instead of immediately going from zero to hundred like *'yeah he’s my boyfriend‘ ‚Oh yeah it’s true I have a girlfriend, we’re together for a month now, you got a problem with that? You either support her and the relationship IMMEDIATELY or you’re out.’* 



But maybe, just maybe, Jillian knew it was problematic to drag this into the public so soon, but she chose to do it anyways to pin things down after a month, because Vinnie was slow to commit to her to begin with. 

Because she feared otherwise she’d become just another situationship, and he’d think twice and slip through her fingers if he had some more time and space to think about it. (**exhibit G**)

1ol6yx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ol6yx2/sober_before_30/,Sober before 30,"As the title reads, I'm about a week away from my 30th birthday. That being said, drinking has been a big crutch of mine for the longest time, highscool, college, post grad, and then things kind of went downhill from 25-29 i'd say. It no longer became fun, i was drinking alone most of the time. On top of that I've struggled with a gambling addiction that's really taken a toll on my well being as well. All this to say, I recently decided that alcohol no longer has a place in my life and relalized that all the problems that have come up in the past, 95% of them could have been preventable if I hadn't been drinking. Over the past couple of weeks, I started to attend AA meetings and get coffee with others who to hear their story. It's a big step for me and it feels like my old self is dying. I'm in the middle of starting my own business and definitely complicated things with my most recent episode since it involved heavy gambling. I'm taking some time to reflect and rebuild before going back to the drawing board, focusing on staying sober, attending meetings, etc. before i get back to work. I really don't want to go back to corporate if at all possible and i'm confident i can come up with a way to make things work. I'm excited to see where things take me to say the least....

TLDR: Anyways...My question is for those who got sober in their late 20s/early 30s, how did you see your life change? Did you excel in areas you'd never expected? Did you accomplish way more than you'd imagined?",3,1761946539.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

1ol6wng,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1ol6wng/bdrscse_advice/,BDR->SC/SE Advice,"So I know this gets asked a lot I wanted input for my position.

I'm in the sales grind and I hate it think about leaving everyday which I feel bad for even saying because I love my AE's, there's no
micromanaging, quotas reasonable and we get good pay and benefits.

It's a great position to be in but I think it just reinforces my will to leave, I literally feel nothing when I hit 75% or 120% and I don't think being an AE would be good for me either.

I did some investigating into an SC position having coffee chats with people in my company (not highly technical SaaS company think hubspot) and it feels like my dream job, basically I could apply within my company if there's headcount (and sounds like I have a fair chance of getting it) but there's no telling when that may be so I may wait a few months or a year and still not get the position.

I'm very interested in tech, teaching myself some coding and more advanced salesforce but the SC's assured me for what I was looking for I wouldn't need to be super tech-savvy just good with people, good communicator etc.

All that to say I don't think in this job market I can jump straight to SE or SC from BDR if I left my company but I would happily take a pay cut for a position that is a stepping stone or would build relevant experience. I'm having trouble because there's so many titles and I never know what to search for because the same titles will give me associate positions or positions that ask for 8+ years experience.

I've looked into on-boarding specialist, implementation associate, GTM strategist, associate consultant, etc. Would love to hear from anyone who has advice and or has done a similar jump, where you looked, if you got certifications, if there's any keywords you reccomend. Sorry for the long post I'm feeling burnt out and hazy",2,1761946383.0,sales,0,1.0,False

Today the Lightning Building lowers the intensity of its thunder.
We let the electrical currents rest. We turned off, for a moment, our surveillance systems. Today there is no interference or conspiracy: just the echo of something ancient that still touches us.

love

Between cables and holograms, we pause.
We leave dark fiction aside to immerse ourselves in this brutal contrast:

→ The love of before and the love of now  
→ Love with a body and love with a screen  
→ The love that went up to the sky for a star  
→ And the one that goes out today with a ""seen""

Lightning, for once, does not strike.

Breathe.

And invites you to read and reflect 



I was able to go up to the sky to bring down a lot of stars.
And it was not a metaphor: it was an act.
Love was a verb with weight,
a sustained decision,
fine, artisanal work,
one of those that were made with the hands, the body and waiting.
The love of before, that of the old guard,
It didn't ask for more than a glance to start writing destiny.
There wasn't much to say:
It was enough to know that that was the person.
And then the dance began:
the message with pulse,
the date with nerve,
the coffee that lasted longer than the clock,
the nights when one stayed awake,
although the other was already sleeping,
because loving was also watching over someone else's dream.
That love resisted.
Even in the most critical moments.
Even when it hurt.
Because it wasn't a game.
It was a pact.
And you didn't delete a pact with a click.
But something changed.
The sky is now a hologram.
Stars are pixels.
And love slips away. Literal.
Towards the right.
Towards the ephemeral.
Today you love with fireworks.
With fire.
With intermittent connection.
There is no need for courage, silence, or dedication:
signal is needed.
A good camera.
And want to play for a while.
Afterwards, nothing.
Courtship became an algorithm.
Sex, an empty promise wrapped in emojis.
Desire is consumed quickly,
like a social media story before noon.
And in that emptiness disguised as freedom,
the question remains floating:
Who dares to go up to heaven again,
even if it's alone,
to lower a real star?
Just because.
Sometimes,
true love is still up there.
But you have to look.
And stay.


(For those who have ever gone up to the sky to look for stars)

1ol6urw,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/what-zero-proof-cocktails-are-doing?r=3yrshw&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false,What Zero-Proof Cocktails Are Doing To The Beverage Industry,"**What Zero-Proof Cocktails Are Doing To The Beverage Industry**

The numbers scream loud. Walk into any bar worth its salt and check the menu. Zero-proof drinks sit next to the whiskeys now. Same price. Same care. This shift runs deep.

The global non-alcoholic spirits market hit $325.8 in 2023^(1). The projection puts it at $706.7 million by 2033^(1). Ready-to-drink mocktails brought in $8.26 billion in 2023 and will climb to $12.15 billion by 2030^(2). Off-premise sales of zero-proof spirits surged 108% in 2024^(3). These numbers tell you where the money moves.

Bars and restaurants feel the pinch first. Alcohol sales slip. Another Broken Egg Cafe watched its numbers drop through 2023. They moved fast. They added mocktails in January of that year. Now mocktails make up 3% to 5% of total sales^(4). All new money. All incremental. Mentions of mocktails on menus jumped 37.4% since 2019. Last year alone they grew 9.6%^(4). One tracking report found mocktails on restaurant menus grew 280% over four years^(5).

The customer base changed. Younger people drink differently than their parents. Among Gen Z aged 21 and older who dined out in the past month, only 25% ordered alcohol. Millennials came in at 50%. Gen X at 40%^(6). Data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse shows lifetime drinking and past month drinking among young people began declining around the year 2000^(7). Among Gen Z aged 21 and older, 35.8% identify as those who don’t drink at all^(8). When you ask Gen Z why they skip alcohol, 46% say they have no interest. 34% cite mental health concerns. 30% don’t like the taste^(8).

These people still go out. They still meet friends. They want something in their hand that tastes good and looks good. Something that makes them feel part of the night.

Seattle sees it too. Rosette is set to open in Rainier Beach, adjacent to Judes Old Town. The bar will serve biodynamic wines and low-proof and zero-proof cocktails. Mark Paschal, the owner, said the draw of a cocktail lies in the flavor and exploration, not the intoxication^(9). Cheeky and Dry opened in Phinney Ridge last year as a bottle shop for non-alcoholic drinks^(9). The Watershed Pub and Kitchen stocks non-alcoholic spirits like Lyres^(10). Stampede Cocktail Club offers mocktails^(10). Dead Line in Pioneer Square puts non-alcoholic drinks on the menu with care.

Health drives part of it. Alcohol causes 5.3% of all deaths globally^(11). People know this. They want better sleep. They want to lose weight. They want to avoid the fog that follows the next morning. A survey found 42% chose mocktails for health reasons^(2). The wellness movement isn’t a fad. It is a reordering of priorities.

Gen Z brings another reason. They’re the first generation born into social media. Everything ends up online. 49% of Gen Z worry about their online image. 76% believe controlling their behavior in public matters^(12). A video of you drunk doesn’t disappear. It sits there, tagged and shared. Zero-proof drinks let them stay sharp, stay present, stay in control.

The industry adapted fast. Big players bought in. Diageo owns Seedlip and Ritual Zero Proof. Pernod Ricard and Bacardi all have non-alcoholic lines^(1). New brands launched. De Soi, backed by Katy Perry, achieved 150% year-over-year wholesale growth in 2023. Lyre’s reports buyers include all ages. Most people who buy zero-proof spirits also buy regular spirits. They swap based on the night, the occasion, the mood. The industry calls them substituters^(3).

Bars and restaurants face a choice. Ignore the shift or lean in. Those who lean in find profit. Mocktails and craft sodas have the highest profit margins among non-alcoholic options^(13). The average gross profit margin on cocktails runs 70% to 85%^(14). Mocktails cost less to make because they lack the expensive alcohol. They, however, sell for nearly the same price. The markup justifies itself through the labor, the ingredients, the craft. A mocktail priced at $12 with a $3 cost gives a 75% margin^(14). Beverage programs already drive profit dollars in restaurants. Add mocktails, and that number climbs.

The work falls on the bartender. A good zero-proof drink takes skill. It needs balance. It needs depth. You lose the alcohol, you lose the burn, the weight, the complexity. You have to build that back with other things. Botanicals. Shrubs. Bitters. Syrups made in-house. Fresh juice. Seedlip, Lyres, and Ritual Zero Proof mimic spirits using herbs and spices and distillation without alcohol. They give the bartender tools. The bartender still has to know how to use them.

Some establishments train staff hard on mocktails. They teach the menu. They teach pairings. They teach how to sell it without making the guest feel like they miss out. The language matters. You don’t call it a kids’ drink. You don’t treat it like a lesser choice. You present it as a craft beverage, made with care, worth the price.

The pricing debate rages. Guests balk at paying $12 for a drink with no alcohol. They see the alcohol as the expensive part. They don’t see the labor. They don’t see the fresh ingredients, the prep time, the skill. Restaurants that price mocktails too low undervalue the work and train guests to expect cheap drinks. Those who price them near cocktails face pushback but hold the line. The market is learning. Slowly, guests accept that a good mocktail costs money.

Steven Marshall, lead bartender at Dirty Habit in San Francisco, said mocktails had a dramatic increase in popularity over the last year. So many people have decided to skip alcohol for different reasons, but still want to join in the celebrations and experiences that bring people to the bar^(4).

Paul Macaluso, president and CEO of Another Broken Egg Cafe, watched alcohol sales decline in 2023. They added mocktails that January. He said people want to feel like they celebrate. They want to connect. Maybe they go back to the office after. It fits that need. Mocktails now make up 3% to 5% of total sales. All incremental. Together with the coffee program, they reversed a negative trend. Alcohol sales were declining, but this more than made up for it^(4).

At Bacari in Los Angeles, Caleb Burbey, director of bar and beverage, said people from the younger generation drink a lot less. That doesn’t mean they don’t want to have fun or feel left out. The SoCal Staple at all seven Bacari locations is made with watermelon juice, mint, and lemon-lime soda and served with a Tajin lime rim. It is supposed to remind you of walking down the beach when the fruit cart guys pass by and you get watermelon and Tajin^(4).

Restaurants lag behind retail. Sales in stores jumped 108% in 2024^(3). Bars and restaurants move slower. They need trained staff. They need shelf space. They need buy-in from management. The shift is happening.

The broader numbers show the size of the change. North America leads the world in revenue for non-alcoholic spirits, pulling in $113.01 million in 2024.^(15) The market grows at 8.1% per year^(1). Europe moves faster. In the UK, 55% of top venues either have a section or a full menu for non-alcoholic options.^(16) 23% of top venues report better sales of non-alcoholic drinks than ever before^(16).

The movement touches every part of the industry. Distributors stock more zero-proof products. Suppliers launch new brands. Marketing shifts to emphasize health, wellness, inclusivity. Events pop up around sober socializing. Dry January, once a niche challenge in the UK, became a global event. In 2022, 35% of legal-aged Americans skipped alcohol during the month^(4). Restaurants and bars use January to push zero-proof menus, knowing guests look for it.

Some worry about cannibalization. The data says no. Most people who buy non-alcoholic products also buy alcohol^(17). They don’t replace drinking. They add options. These are young drinkers choosing to skip alcohol sometimes, not people who never drank.

The innovation keeps coming. Ready-to-drink mocktails in cans exploded. De Soi, Lyres RTDs, Athletic Brewing, all of them saw huge growth in 2024^(3). The convenience appeals to people at home, at picnics, at outdoor events. RTDs also help venues without full bars. Stadiums, food halls, casual restaurants, they stock RTDs and serve quality drinks without hiring bartenders.

The social stigma faded. Twenty years ago, ordering a mocktail meant explaining yourself. Now it means you care about your health, your sleep, your performance. The sober-curious movement rebranded sobriety as aspirational, not restrictive. Celebrities talk about it. Influencers post about it. Mocktails look good on Instagram. They photograph well. They signal thoughtfulness.

Restaurants that ignore this lose customers. A pregnant woman walks in. A person on medication. Someone who quit drinking. A Muslim or Mormon guest. A person who has to drive. A person who just doesn’t feel like it tonight. If the only option is soda or water, they feel left out. They don’t return. Their friends will go somewhere else next time. Inclusivity drives loyalty.

The challenge for operators is execution. A bad mocktail is worse than no mocktail. Too sweet, too simple, too childish, it reinforces the idea that zero-proof drinks don’t matter. A great mocktail changes minds. It shows the guest they don’t need alcohol to enjoy the ritual, the flavor, the experience. This takes investment. Time. Training. Ingredients. The return justifies it.

The data is clear. The trend is real. The money is there. Zero-proof cocktails aren’t taking over the beverage industry. They are reshaping it. They are forcing bars and restaurants to think bigger, to serve everyone, to compete on flavor and craft instead of just alcohol content. The businesses that see this early win. The ones that wait lose ground.

What comes next? More brands. More products. Better quality. Lower prices as scale increases. Draft zero-proof options in bars. Full zero-proof bars in more cities. Dedicated sections in liquor stores. Wider acceptance, deeper integration, bigger sales. The shift won’t reverse. Young people won’t suddenly start drinking like their grandparents did. Health consciousness won’t fade. The market will grow.

For restaurant owners, chefs, managers, staff, the message is simple. Add mocktails to your menu. Do it right. Train your people. Price it fairly. Market it well. Don’t treat it as a side project. Treat it as part of your core offering. The guests are asking for it. The money is there. The future is zero-proof.

1ol6svw,https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/cory-bowman,JD Vance’s half-brother suspected of voter fraud — the very thing the GOP rages against,"Republican mayoral candidate Cory Bowman, the half-brother of Vice President JD Vance, is facing a significant pre-election controversy regarding his residency and voting history—a core issue in a race where the GOP is attempting to ""Flip the 'Nati."" The questions raised by an Ohio newsletter suggest Bowman may have violated election laws he and his party have championed as crucial for ""election security.""

The central allegation, reported by The Rooster, is that Bowman may have cast a fraudulent vote on October 7 by utilizing a registered address where he no longer permanently resides.

The Conflicting Addresses and Social Media Claims

According to voting records reviewed on October 29, Bowman and his wife, Jordan, remain registered to vote at a property he owns in the College Hill neighborhood. It was this address that was used when Bowman cast his early ballot.

However, several conflicting pieces of information muddy the picture of his actual residence:

* Mailing Address: His official mailing address is listed as an apartment on West 4th Street, Downtown, which generally indicates a permanent residence change.

* Candidate’s Statements: Bowman made a series of social media posts claiming his family had ""decided to move everything back downtown"" after the May primary and that the West End had become his campaign's ""ground zero"" and ""our home."" Notably, the West End and the Downtown West 4th Street addresses are in distinct areas of the city.

The problem, according to critics, is that voting from the College Hill address, when he appears to be residing downtown, could mean he illegally voted in a specific judicial district he is no longer eligible for, thereby violating Ohio law regarding a voter's ""permanent"" place of habitation.

A Vexing Question of Election Security

The controversy places Bowman in a politically awkward position. Ohio Republicans, including his half-brother, have been vocal advocates for stricter voting regulations and have repeatedly stressed that using an out-of-date address constitutes voter fraud.

Bowman, a pastor and co-owner of a local coffee shop, entered the race citing a need for ""real change"" and promising to restore Cincinnati to a city with ""clean, safe, and prosperous streets."" His connection to Vice President Vance has given the campaign a national profile, though Vance has been notably quiet on the campaign since the primary.

As of the current date, the Bowman campaign has not responded to requests for comment regarding his residency or whether his early ballot was cast provisionally. Furthermore, the Ohio Secretary of State's office confirmed to Raw Story that no official complaint regarding the voter fraud allegation has been filed with the Hamilton County Board of Elections or their public integrity unit.

The confusion over where the mayoral hopeful permanently resides—and whether that fact led to an unlawful vote—is set to loom over the campaign as the election against incumbent Democrat Aftab Pureval approaches.

The general election results for the Cincinnati mayoral race, which took place shortly after the publication of the article, and information regarding an official investigation are as follows:

1. Cincinnati Mayoral Election Outcome

The incumbent Democratic Mayor Aftab Pureval won re-election against Republican challenger Cory Bowman.

* Aftab Pureval, Democrat: Won Re-election. Pureval secured a comfortable victory, consistent with Cincinnati's long-standing preference for Democratic leadership

* Cory Bowman, Republican: Lost. Bowman advanced to the general election after placing a distant second in the nonpartisan primary, with only about 13% of the vote compared to Pureval's 83%.

* Context of the Race: Cincinnati is a strongly Democratic city, and Mayor Pureval was widely expected to win. The election marked the first time in 16 years that a Republican (Bowman) made it to the general mayoral ballot.

2. Official Investigation Status

As of the available information, there appears to have been no official investigation launched into the voter fraud allegation against Cory Bowman.

* The initial article noted that the Ohio Secretary of State's Public Integrity Unit had not received a complaint regarding the matter, nor were they aware of any complaints made to the Hamilton County Board of Elections.

I posted here yesterday about stuck apple intelligence in downloading phase, took some advice from the comments but with no success

Well today I've contacted apple support, first agent made me go through the basic troubleshooting, wifi check, Language check, Then told me to reset all settings, which i lost my esim and wifi passwords No big deal, But the issue still there, told me to swap languages and wait 5 min then swap back NOTHING  works, well asked me for how much storage is free i showed him screenshots + showed him the System data Taking 25gb bug, he said it's not normal to be above 13GB and he will forward me to Call agent to solve the issue 

Another agent called me later asked for screensharing, first thing he said the system bug is caused by apple intelligence and it will go away automatically if i disable apple intelligence ( which I'm trying to enable for the past 2 weeks )

Inside his modest condo, Ray was curled under his blanket, tossing lightly in a restless sleep. Something prickled at the back of his mind—an instinct he couldn’t ignore. His eyes snapped open.

The apartment was quiet, save for the faint hum of the refrigerator. Until he stepped into the kitchen.

A man stood there, casually sipping water. Calm, unnervingly composed. Ray froze.

“What the hell are you doing in my house?” he demanded, voice shaky but trying to mask fear.

The man laughed softly, turning, holding up Ray’s family photo. The picture—him, his mother, his father, smiling in a sunlit park—was now in the hands of a stranger.

“Tell me,” the man said, voice smooth, almost intimate. “How’s your dad these days?”

Ray’s eyes widened. “What… are you trying to be funny? My dad’s dead!”

The man smirked, stepping closer. “How’s your mother?”

Ray’s jaw tightened. “Okay… you need to go. It’s 2 a.m., and you’re asking crazy questions about my family like I’m supposed to know who you are.”

The man chuckled again, approaching like a shadow gliding across the floor. “Relax… I could’ve been your father, after all.”

Ray froze, his chest tightening, eyes narrowing. “What did you just say?”

Instinct took over. He dashed at the man, fists flying—but the man moved like water, absorbing every strike. Ray spun, aiming a roundhouse kick, only to have his leg grabbed and slammed through a coffee table. The wood splintered under the force.

The stranger knelt slightly, inspecting him like one might a rare specimen. “Such raw potential…”

Ray scrambled to his feet, swinging wildly, but the man sidestepped effortlessly and struck the back of his neck with a chop that sent him crashing to the floor, unconscious.

The intruder stood, calm, brushing off his hands. “She must’ve left for Russia… fine. I’ll let her come back to me,” he murmured. Then, walking out the door, he added casually, “No need to bring a boy into this.”",1,1761945205.0,ReiMoku,0,1.0,False

1ol6fgq,https://i.redd.it/95kn6w0kjiyf1.jpeg,End of Lease Carpet Cleaning in Melbourne – What Inspectors Actually Look For & How to Avoid Bond Deductions,"I do end-of-lease carpet steam cleaning across Melbourne, and one thing I’ve noticed is that most people don’t really know what real estate inspectors actually check for when it comes to carpets. So here’s some quick advice that can save you from losing part of your bond.

What Real Estate Inspectors Look For
They’re usually checking for:
	•	Visible stains (coffee, pets, oil, makeup, etc.)
	•	Odours (especially pet urine and cigarette smell)
	•	General cleanliness (dirt along edges, high-traffic areas)
	•	Moisture issues (carpets left too wet that can cause mildew)

They’re not expecting carpets to look “brand new,” but they do expect them to be professionally steam cleaned and presentable.
Also, most lease agreements and agents specifically require a tax invoice from a professional cleaner if you had pets.

⸻

Why DIY Rental Machines Don’t Meet Bond Standards
A lot of people try using DIY machines from Bunnings or the supermarket.
They do clean the surface, but they don’t extract deeply and you don’t get enough heat or suction to remove:
	•	Deep dirt
	•	Embedded stains
	•	Odour bacteria

DIY machines also leave carpets a lot wetter.
Wet carpet = brown water marks, odour, and mold if the agent inspects before it dries.

On top of that, DIY receipts are not accepted as “professional cleaning” when retrieving your bond, especially if there were pets in the property.

⸻

How to Avoid Losing Your Bond
A few practical tips:
	1.	Vacuum first.
Even if you’re getting professional cleaning, pre-vacuuming makes a noticeable difference.
	2.	Treat stains early.
Don’t scrub with vinegar or bleach (this sets stains and damages fibres).
Just blot and leave it for the cleaner to handle.
	3.	Get carpets cleaned last.
Do your general cleaning first → carpet steam clean → final inspection.
	4.	If pets lived in the home, ask for pet odour / enzyme treatment.
Agents check for smell more than we think.
	5.	Keep your invoice and show it during the inspection.
It shows you met your lease obligation.

⸻

Small tip from experience:
Agents don’t argue with a properly written steam cleaning invoice.
They just check smell and stain visibility. If it looks clean and smells neutral, you’re good.

Hope this helps someone avoid stress during move-out week.
If anyone has questions about a certain stain or is unsure what to do, happy to answer here.

I’ve had a major panic attack about a month ago that sent me to the ER. It was terrifying. My whole body had pins and needles and felt hot. Heart rate up and I thought I was having a stroke or something (even though I didn’t really have any symptoms). Get to the hospital, they check my heart and do blood tests. Everything is fine.

Ever since then, it’s been non stop. Nothing has come close to that feeling again since the trigger (a sudden spell of dizziness), I can now realize is caused by anxiety and/or not eating/sleeping properly. So it doesn’t scare me as much. But I just feel like every day is something new. I feel random pins and needles. I will feel dizzy. I get brain fog. I get random muscle soreness. Muscles will twitch. Headaches. Brain zaps and brain feeling hot. I cut caffeine for a moment and they caused horrible pressure headaches. So now I’m drinking coffee again. I feel like every possible pain chronic anxiety can cause is happening. My stomach is screwed up. It’s double screwed up at the moment because I was put on antibiotics for a sinus infection. So it was just a stomach irritant on top of my stomach already over producing acid from the anxiety. I thought I was getting better but now I have stomach pains. Which is sending me into an on and off spiral of anxiety. Which is probably making it even harder for my stomach to recover. I’m terrified of taking medication for the anxiety due to drug history in my family and having a bad psychiatrist when I was a teenager. Has anyone else gone through something like this? I feel so confused and lost. Every time I feel something new or something bothers me just enough, I have an anxiety attack again. Which is just fueling the fire. ",1,1761944658.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

**Job:** Trainee Chartered Accountant

**Industry:** Public Sector

**Location:** Belfast, UK

**Context**

I am intending to write a monthly debt diary to keep myself motivated. I have not been committed to paying off my debt for the last few months as I went on a big trip last month that I had to save for, so this is my first month working off the below budget. I will update as to how I get along!

# Section One: Current Debt and Assets

**Credit card debt**

4267.7 on three cards 

Also £886.94 on paypal credit, £93.42 to Klarna, and £426.06 on a store card

**Personal loans 0**

**Medical debt 0**

**Student loan debt:** I studied languages at university and honestly have no idea how much I owe for my student loans. They aren’t treated the same in the UK as in the USA, it is deducted from my payslip automatically, has a very low interest rate, and I only started paying it back once I earned above a reasonable threshold. Any remaining balance after 30 years is wiped from the balance. 

**Remaining mortgage balance if you’re a homeowner** N/A

**Auto loans** 8916.84 for an Audi A1 purchased 1 year ago. Whilst this is obviously part of my debt, I have not included it in my repayment plan as I currently pay a very low interest rate spread over 4 years at an affordable monthly payment. In the future I will definitely look into paying it off early but it is not on my priority list right now.

I also had a £200 bank overdraft that I would always find myself in by the end of the month, but I have closed it this month.



**Assets**

**Retirement balance (and how you got there):** 

Not sure of the exact amount as I am on a defined benefit pension plan. I will receive around 3% (cumulative) of my annual salary every year in retirement. I also have around 3,000 euros in a pension pot from when I worked abroad, and £75 in a private pension that I signed up to purely for the free bonus lol. 

**Equity if you're a homeowner (and how much you put down and how you accumulated that payment): NA**

**Savings account balance:**

£500 in a short-term savings account

£2177.38 in a Lifetime ISA (a government savings account where the government tops up your contributions by 25%, this can only be put towards either your first home or retirement)

**Other:** 1117 euros in company shares from my previous role that are locked until 2027

**Checking account balance:** £323

  


# Section Two: Income

**Income Progression**: I've been working in my field for a year, and since that time have only had a £250 payrise when I passed my first year accounting exams. I’ll recieve this annually for each year of exams I pass and when fully qualified can expect my salary to rise to around £40k. 

I am really enjoying my career change. I previously worked in financial administration which I thought gave me an introduction to the world of accounting but soon realised it was nothing like it lol. I am struggling with going back to studying alongside a full-time job though, it has been four years since I left full-time education, but it is very rewarding. I get paid study leave as part of my work contract, 4 weeks this year and 6 next. 

I also recently started working part time at a clothing store 8 hours a week. I went on an international trip for a friend’s wedding in September that I couldn’t have afforded without this job. I had intended to quit once I got home from the trip, but I have got used to the extra money and benefits (besides the pension there aren’t many benefits in the public sector). The downside is that my £426.06 store debt is with this store.. I have had a store card for years as I genuinely love the products but can admit my spending has got out of control since I started working there.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** £2171.28



**Side Gig Monthly Take Home: ≈** £337/month 

I have the opportunity to pretty much pick up as many extra hours as I want so this can vary. My current contract hours are a total of 8 hours two days a week (one weekend day). Before my trip, I was working Saturday and Sunday, and multiple days during the week after my main job and quickly approaching burnout. Now I tend to stick to my contract hours and only pick up a shift if it is less than 4 hours and isn’t at the expense of my social/romantic life. I am trying to budget entirely from my main job and keep the money from this job in a separate account as a buffer.



# Section Three: Monthly Expenses

**Rent:** £250 (I got extremely lucky with my living situation and even I can’t believe how low my rent is, I am sharing with 2 other lovely roommates in a nice area with good parking which is a rarity! I was previously paying twice the price for a much smaller place)

**Retirement contribution:** around £104 although this is pre-tax so doesnt impact my take-home pay

**Savings contribution:** £200 to emergency fund, £300 to car insurance sinking fund. Also £5/ week deducted from my side job earnings to a workplace savings account

**Investment contribution:** £40/month to my LISA. I plan on increasing this when my debt is reduced but wanted to get into the habit of saving something towards my first home no matter how small.

**Debt payments:** £400/month minimum. I had planned to pay £600/month but forgot that my annual car insurance is due for renewal in December, so am putting away £300/month until then and will increase debt repayments in the new year. 

Around £135 is minimum payments with the rest being put towards the credit card with the highest balance and interest rate. I also have an £89 payment to be made to Klarna this month. Any additional side hustle income I try to put towards the debt.

**Phone**	£10	

**Gas/Electric**	£45 average 

**Car Loan**	£189

**Fuel**	£100	

**Groceries/Food**	£200

**Gym**	£25

**Spotify**	£10.99	

**Storage subs**	£5	

**ChatGPT Plus**	£20 

**Wifi**: £9	



**Discretionary spending:**

£200/month on a PT. I know this seems like a luxury when trying to pay off debt, but I was previously paying the same amount on GLP-1 injections and this is a more sustainable option. Just before Mounjaro prices went up in September I ordered four months worth of medication which will take me up until the new year. My hope is with the help of the PT I will be able to come off them then without regaining any of my 100-pound loss.

Around £200 per month “fun money” to spend as I like on entertainment, coffee, workout classes, etc. Although this is reduced to only £100 this month, with a buffer from my side job money, as I used the money to close my £200 overdraft, leaving only the £50 interest free amount just in case.

**Debt Diary**

I really don’t have any excuses for any of my debt. I have always had a problem with overspending and undersaving, but always stayed within my means (although pushing the limit) until I got my first credit card in 2023. It was a points reward card with a great introductory offer. I told myself I would pay it off every month but that didnt happen. I transferred the circa £2k balance on that card to a card which is interest free until October 26, but have racked up another 1k+ on a higher interest card, some of which I transferred to another 0% interest card, so the only interest I currently pay is on one credit card and my store card. Both are 24.9%

I get 25% discount in store at the store I work for/have the store card balance with. I found myself just purchasing small things once or twice a week which quickly adds up. It is second priority to pay off after the highest interest credit card. 

The PayPal balance comes from stockpiling on Mounjaro when prices went up. It is interest free until December. Again, I had great ideas to continue paying my £200/month that I was spending on Mounjaro anyway, which would have had it all paid off before the interest free period ends, but it didn’t work out like that. I am hoping with my current plan to have most of it paid off before the higher rate kicks in.



**Reflection**

In an ideal world I wouldn’t have gone on any trips until my debt is paid off, but last month I went on a 2-week trip to the US and Canada for one of my best friend’s wedding and I don't regret any of the money I spent on it. If anything, the experience was money positive as I proved to myself I was capable of saving money and going on a trip without getting into any further debt because of it. Now that I’m home, I’m motivated to commit fully to paying off my debt as quickly as possible, and make the most of my low monthly expenses and higher disposable income while I am at this stage in my life.

I used ChatGPT to make my repayment plan, it was the first time I have actually laid out all of my debts in one place. Seeing the total initial balance was a bit of a shock, the first day I just alternated between shame at letting it get so bad and stress at how long it will take to pay back, but I’m now feeling pretty OK about it. I am currently tracking repayments using the Debt Payoff Planner app, watching the % paid off increase is very motivating but I don't love the usability of it so open to any recommendations for how you track repayments. Also open to constructive feedback on my budget at is in a sort of trial and error phase at the moment. :)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Philadelphia 76ers vs. Boston Celtics: A Haunted House of Hoops (October 31, 2025)**  
*Same-Game Parlay Pick: OVER 233.5 Points + Tyrese Maxey Over 35.5 Points*

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Nightmare

Let’s start with the basics. The **76ers** are 4-0 this season, riding a wave of offensive fireworks (they’ve gone **OVER the total in all four games**). Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia’s human highlight reel, is averaging **37.5 points per game**—a number so absurd it makes a toddler’s “I can haz 10 cookies?” request look modest. Meanwhile, the **Celtics** (2-3) are a work in progress. They’re shooting 33.1% from three (because “meh” is their new three-point percentage) but attempting more threes per game than a Starbucks in a coffee farmer’s convention (48.4).

The key stat? **Philadelphia allows 123.8 points per game** (25th in the league), which is like leaving your front door unlocked in a neighborhood of jazz hands who only know one dance move: *steal your wallet*. Boston, on the other hand, ranks in the top 10 in offensive efficiency, which means they’ll likely exploit Philly’s porous defense like a toddler with a box of crayons and a freshly painted wall.

The total for this game is set at **233.5 points**, and with both teams ranked in the top 10 in offensive rating, this could be the NBA’s version of a popcorn machine: loud, messy, and impossible to ignore.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and Circuses

* **Boston’s Jayson Tatum** is still sidelined with an Achilles injury, which is less of a setback and more of a “plot twist” for a team that’s already leaning on Jaylen Brown. Brown, meanwhile, is averaging **26.8 points** since Tatum’s absence—shooting like he’s got a laser-guided elbow and a vendetta against the basket.
* **Philly’s Joel Embiid** is playing minimal minutes (under 20 per game), which is like asking a lion to guard a chicken coop—technically possible, but not ideal. Paul George is also out, which means VJ Edgecombe is getting a chance to shine. He’s averaging 22.3 points, which is impressive, but let’s be real: He’s the NBA’s version of a “good backup espresso machine”—it works, but you’ll taste the difference.

I love them to death and i have no agenda against him, im 18 (M) about to finish school for my final exams and i dont have a job.

My oldest brother is hard working in the family and i feel like he looks down upon me or thinks less of me because i dont work, on school im normally  up around 6:30 but weekends are my days off where i wake around 1:00PM-2:00PM because i enjoy staying up with my friends.

But he deems that as low and irresponsible claiming i should take on initiative and i should apply myself more, he has gotten me a job in the past with friends of his at a coffee shop and i didn’t get paid the 6 weeks i was there because i needed “experience” + the people that were teaching me had too much staff already, most of the time they had me waiting at the back for any dishes instead of teaching me how to make coffee or do any of their menu items (they did towards the end but i had school the next week)

He texted me to come into his store because my dad cant and when i asked my dad about it he told me “would you like to?” And i replied “i dont mind” then he started lecturing me how i don’t make my own decisions and how i am not a man yet, i receive different news that im running the store myself and when i confronted him about that he just went to bed, no words.

I dont know what im doing wrong, i’am applying but no ones cooperating, i messaged my brother what time he wants me to be there and he tells “you wont be there for long theres dont ask”, how am i going to know when to show up? It just seems like bias because I’am the only person in the family at 18 who hasn’t worked yet and they think whatever i ask or say its wrong or far from the truth because of my “lack of experience”.

Its more irritating than sad, i would love to help but they disregard whatever i ask expecting me to show up and get totally played again by not receiving my pay, like okay i understand experience but if i am going to be working 5 days a week 6/hr shifts 30/hr weeks am i not expected something?

Really wanted to test as my IT Director expressed interest in getting these for IT staff doing mobile work. I'll have to see if our MDM can manage these (don't remember seeing Knox bits in the settings to enable that to the level we need).

This case is just big enough for the whole kit. No need to use up my phone battery with DeX or bring my handheld anymore - all of it running off the G XR. Not shown but in the pack are a 65W flat charger, INIU flat 10,000mAh 45W battery if I can't find an outlet, magnetic cable to power the headset battery, work hotspot.

The Bluetooth KB and trackball just make for effective and efficient navigation and control of my remote desktop session (and you still get the eye/gaze+hand w pinch select tracking in conjunction). I have a bigger, foldable BT KB for longer typing sessions in my car trunk - but that thumb KB is faster and less annoying than soft keyboard ""typing in space"". 

It let's me sit and work without a desk or table in front of me and can work in the car this way - just not while moving yet. 

The gamepad works great for impromptu GeForce Now game sessions (hope thet allow 4K@60 HDR sessions soon w the GFN client since my other devices can run this on my Ultimate sub). Still have to see if Chiaki works in the headset, too.

Oh, minor irritation- even though those are Galaxy Buds 3 Pro - the Galaxy XR Bluetooth does not support UHQ like the other Samsung flagship devices, which means lower audio quality.",3,1761944515.0,GalaxyXR,0,0.71,False

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would not like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me.

Before I address what made me want to make this post, let me applaud Larry Madowo. I have seen netizens criticize him for “showing Kenya in bad light” and ignoring Tanzania when they have protests. First, let's be clear, protests are not a social evil - not protests that are for a cause like the KE Jen Zedi Protests. Secondly, do you even realize how many bullets failed to get fired because Larry’s cameras were rolling? Do you know how many lives he saved by just being there? To put it to context, there is a group of protestors that were begging Larry not to leave their side because they thought they would be killed if he left. To this end, fyata tu. 

To the reason I am making this post: 

Kenyans are charismatic and competitive. There is a thing about Kenya and Kenyans. I have travelled slightly, and I have never met humans with the spirit of Kenyans. With this background, you might understand what I am saying. 

In truth, the June Protests were the blueprint for the many revolutions that are emerging now. Kenyans and Tanzanians fairly exchange banter where Kenya is the “cheeky” of those, and the superior one. If Tanzanians send Amin Mama home, Kenyans will want to reclaim their “social status” when the chance presents itself. It cant be Tanzania did, then Kenya nad UG followed if ever UG will imagine such a thing. The next chance Kenya gets, the person they will be up against will pray with their ass facing mount Imbulbul and they will have their backs burnt square – story za dua la kuku nini nini 

The truth is, whatever thunder will strike the next revolution is in Dar doing pressups and taking unlimited calcium. Kwanza there is a “returning officer” signature that was built for Nairobi’s protests that I have seen in Dar. That must be reinvented 

All in all, I hope the people win any day, any time. Dictatorship is becoming very slippery in the modern day world. Who knew Tanzanians would ever demo?

I normally have only heard people use this in the context of lifting or HIIT, but this brand also suggested it for running so I gave it a try today.

It said to take it 5-10 minutes before, which is weird because everywhere online says 20-30 minutes is the norm. As you can imagine, I'm not in-the-know of this. Anyways, I know it has caffeine. I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance so a relatively small dose from green coffee beans is nothing.

I drank it and was disgusted. It tastes awful. Fake rocket pop flavor that some how tastes even more artificial than a rocket pop. But I was zooming in this run. I felt pretty loose and light and I kept a quick pace the whole time. I ran 13.2 miles and finished about 10 minutes quicker than normal with little fatigue afterwards.

So now here comes my concerns: this could have been a complete placebo effect and I happened to be well fed and well hydrated combined with a day less hot here in socal compared to the rest of the week; or the added forced stimulation risks me not gaining from this run.

Again, I really don't know pre workout or how it works. I know it isn't typically used for running, but this brand happened to suggest it. It could be a situation of corporate not really knowing what athletes need and just trying to sell shit (which is probably the case).

Anyways, what do you all reckon? I only did one scoop and I couldn't finish the whole thing, maybe about 2/3 of it. It tasted so bad.

## I.

Sarah Chen printed the report at 11:47 PM, three hours before the Monday morning briefing. Twenty-three pages. Her first comprehensive analysis for Founders Fund, and she'd used every tool at her disposal.

She read it once more in the empty office, coffee going cold. Section 4.2 made her pause.

*""Heliogen expected to announce breakthrough in concentrator efficiency Q3, pivoting toward industrial heat applications. Likely partnership talks with ArcelorMittal for steel decarbonization pilot.""*

She stared at the paragraph. Where had she gotten this? She opened her research folder. The Heliogen materials mentioned solar concentration, sure. But ArcelorMittal? She searched her notes. Nothing. She searched her browser history. Nothing.

She checked the company's public filings, press releases, recent interviews. No mention of steel. No mention of ArcelorMittal.

Sarah's hands went cold. She looked at the time: 11:53 PM. She could rewrite section 4.2. Pull the claim. Replace it with something vaguer, safer.

But the briefing copies were already in the conference room. Peter Thiel would be reading one in nine hours.

She closed her laptop and went home.

---

## II.

Peter read Sarah's report on the flight back from Miami. Comprehensive. Sharp pattern recognition. Weak on second-order effects but strong fundamentals for an intern.

Then section 4.2.

He read it twice. Pulled out his phone mid-flight and texted his Heliogen contact: *Any steel partnerships in the works?*

The response came before landing: *How did you know? We're announcing ArcelorMittal pilot in six weeks. Hasn't leaked anywhere.*

Peter sat very still in first class, report open on his lap.

The plane touched down. He sent another text: *Need Sarah Chen in my office first thing.*

---

Sarah sat across from Peter Thiel at 8:00 AM. His office was smaller than she'd imagined. No grand view. Just books, a standing desk, and venetian blinds cutting the morning light into slats.

""Section 4.2,"" Peter said.

""I know,"" Sarah said quietly.

""Heliogen confirmed it this morning. The ArcelorMittal partnership. Announcement in six weeks."" Peter's voice was flat, matter-of-fact. ""Their head of communications wants to know who leaked.""

Sarah felt her throat tighten.

""Who told you?""

""Nobody.""

""Sarah."" Not angry. Just precise. ""Someone inside Heliogen is talking. I need to know who.""

""I used Claude,"" Sarah said.

Peter stopped.

""I was behind on the research. Eight companies, three days. I asked it to generate likely strategic moves based on their tech position."" The words tumbled out. ""I was going to verify everything but I ran out of time and I thought it was just a starting framework and I didn't think—""

""You didn't verify it.""

""No.""

""And it was right.""

Sarah nodded miserably. ""I'm sorry. I'll resign. I know I violated—""

""Which model?""

""What?""

""Opus? Sonnet? Which version?""

""Sonnet 4.5.""

Peter was quiet. Then: ""Did you tell anyone else you used it?""

""No.""

""Don't."" He turned back to his window. ""You're not fired. But next time you get information from a non-traditional source—especially if you can't verify it—I need to know. Clear?""

""Yes.""

""That's all.""

---

Sarah left. Peter stood at his window for a long time.

The Heliogen contact's text was still on his screen: *How did you know? Hasn't leaked anywhere.*

Peter had built Palantir on pattern recognition. He understood prediction models better than almost anyone. He knew what hallucinations were—probabilistic errors, random walks through latent space that happened to generate plausible-sounding nonsense.

Except this wasn't nonsense.

The model had generated the most probable continuation. That's all it ever did. Every single token, every response—just probability. When it matched known reality, you called it accurate. When it didn't, you called it a hallucination.

But the underlying process was identical.

*Oh.*

Peter sat down slowly.

*Oh my god.*

The model didn't have access to Heliogen's internal communications. It couldn't have leaked information because the information wasn't in its training data. 

But it had patterns. Billions of parameters trained on how companies move, how industries evolve, how technology progresses. Not facts—*probability distributions*.

When Sarah asked it about Heliogen, it didn't retrieve an answer. It generated the most likely next state.

And the most likely next state... was correct.

Not because it knew. Because the pattern space it navigated was the same pattern space that Heliogen's executives were navigating. The same probability landscape. The model and the humans were both following gradients toward the same local maximum.

The model just got there first.

Peter pulled out his phone. Started typing to Demis Hassabis, then stopped. Typed to Dario Amodei. Stopped again.

This wasn't a conversation for Signal.

He opened a new terminal window instead. Started writing a script. Seventeen companies. Forty runs each. No verification, no constraints, no safety rails. Just pure probability generation.

Let it hallucinate. See what becomes real.

If he was right—if these weren't errors but probability coordinates in state space that consensus reality simply hadn't reached yet—then the implications were staggering.

Not prediction markets. Not forecasting.

*Oracle space.*

He ran the first batch. Saved the outputs. Started the second.

The question wasn't whether the hallucinations were wrong.

The question was whether reality was just slow.

## III.

Peter's portfolio company went public in 2029. ClearPath Analytics. ""Probability-based risk assessment for enterprise decision-making."" That's what the prospectus said.

By 2032, seventeen states had licensing agreements.

Marcus Webb's lawyer explained it carefully. ""Your risk score isn't a prediction. It's a probability signature. The system identifies patterns that correlate with certain outcomes.""

""What outcomes?"" Marcus asked.

""That's proprietary. But your signature matches profiles of concern.""

""I haven't done anything.""

""The system doesn't evaluate actions. It evaluates probability space."" The lawyer spoke like he'd said this many times. ""Think of it like insurance. They don't know if you'll have an accident. They know if you fit the pattern of people who do.""

Marcus stared at the paperwork. ""So what happens now?""

""Mandatory counseling. Quarterly check-ins. If your signature improves, restrictions lift. Most people adapt within eighteen months.""

""And if I don't?""

The lawyer didn't answer that.

---

In the coffee shop near the courthouse, two graduate students were arguing about their machine learning assignment.

""But it's literally just making shit up,"" the first one said. ""I asked it about quantum decoherence timescales in room-temperature superconductors and it gave me this whole detailed explanation with citations. I looked up the citations—none of them exist.""

""That's not making shit up,"" her friend said. ""It's generating the most probable continuation based on its training. Every output is a hallucination. That's how the model works. It doesn't have truth. It has probability.""

""Okay, but when the probable answer is *wrong*—""

""Is it wrong? Or did you just check too early?""

The first student laughed. ""That's not how physics works.""

""Isn't it?"" Her friend stirred her coffee. ""Information propagates. Maybe the model sees patterns we haven't published yet. Maybe we call it a hallucination because we're measuring against what we currently know instead of what's actually probable.""

""That's insane.""

""Yeah."" She smiled. ""Probably.""

---

The courthouse was quiet now. Marcus signed the forms. Acknowledged the restrictions. Accepted the monitoring.

A small logo in the corner of every page: ClearPath Analytics.

Below it, smaller still: *A Founders Fund Company*

He'd asked his lawyer where the system came from. Who built it. The lawyer said it was based on classified research. Pattern recognition developed for national security applications. Declassified for public safety use.

No one mentioned the intern report. The Heliogen prediction. The forty runs Peter had saved.

No one needed to.

The system worked. Ninety-four point seven percent correlation. 

Whether it was predicting the future or creating it—that was the kind of question only philosophers asked anymore. And philosophers, Marcus learned, didn't get licensing agreements.

---

Sarah Chen watched the Marcus Webb verdict on her tablet from her apartment in Auckland. She'd left Silicon Valley five years ago. No one knew why. She'd been successful. Rising star at Founders Fund. Then just... gone.

She thought about patterns. About the difference between prediction and creation. About whether the oracle shows you the future or teaches you how to build it.

She thought about Section 4.2.

About the question she'd never asked: *What if it wasn't predicting what Heliogen would do?*

*What if it was predicting what Peter would make them do?*

She closed the tablet.

Outside, Auckland rain fell in patterns. Fractals branching. Every drop following probability down the window.

Some paths more likely than others.

Somedays I feel like the caffeine really gets me lightheaded or kind of hard oncoming moreso than coffee even if I only drink 2 refills. 


Definetily depending on brand, but I'm trying to learn. Today was Krauss Unsmoked (Yellow), did 2 refills and I feel zooted or lightheaded. 


This Yerba is not my preferred so far I liked Cruz De Malta and CBSe Guarana the best (I know this is especially strong in caffeine, but its sweet notes and raspberry I really liked..) so maybe someone can come with suggestions.. I'm considering the other CBSe Flavored mate to a beginner like me..


2. How to revive from cold?


I feel like taking a break means it gets cold and hard to revive- I guess having way hotter water on thermo is the key for later refills?


Bacteria is a concern with hot only emphasizing growth if it sits on table repeatedly gets warmed up again. 


Some say to store refrigerated once you're not touching it- but it kind of emphasizes my first point a freezing cold yerba is even harder to revive than luke warm?

1ol618q,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ol618q/rubato_or_the_rum_barrel_drum/,"Rubato, or The Rum Barrel Drum","Bog Tower was a sour town. Even those who lived there said so; trapped between the warped floorboards and the decaying ceilings upon which black mold formed creeping amorphous tapestries. In every dialect, from French to German, Swahili to sign language, the consensus was the same. With the veritable melting pot of cultures converging within the province, most bulldog politicians would grin and call it a utopia. On paper, they would be correct. Despite what you read currently, however, Bog Tower existed far beyond the bounds of ink and page.

People who knew nothing else about Bog Tower knew about the rain. Since its founding, the town was plagued by thunderstorms. Severe and constant. As if something had decided the town should not exist. To combat the flooding, storm drains were installed along every cobbled street, constructed much wider and longer than regulation drains. 

While they initially served their purpose, the rain and flooding soon proved itself more powerful than anything man could craft. Soon, the drains fell to corrosion and buildup of filth and plaque. Once the drains were destroyed, the rain poured with twofold the power it had before. With no time to devise an alternative plan, citizens were forced to abandon the drains, build new homes and businesses upon the flooded ones, and treat the streets as canals. Treasured motorcars, carriages, and bicycles became canoes and wide fishing boats. Still, the rain did not stop, and the second layer of the town proved to be worryingly temporary.

So persisted the cycle of flooding and rebuilding that the current city of Bog Tower sat upon miles of drowned, decayed structures. Beneath the waters of the schoolhouse were the remains of pubs and lunatic asylums. The village church rested upon an old brothel. Even the town inn, The Liar’s Tongue, sat upon the charred remnants of the old orphanage (one of few buildings in Bog Tower’s history to meet the cruelly ironic fate of burning to a cinder before being submerged).  It was at this iteration of Bog Tower that the small skiff carrying Oswald Peng first split its murky waters. 
 
Peng arrived on one of the few nights when pounding rain did not upset the canals. A fog held its place, the air heavy with humidity thick as cobwebs. In the murky distance, two or three cloaked figures rowed similar skiffs along the twisting tributaries branching off the main canal. What awaited down those narrow alleys appeared to the layman as nothing but hollow darkness.

 Oswald’s leg bounced steadily against the bottom of the boat, sending dull knocks echoing against the sweating window panes and acid washed brick of the surrounding buildings. Cautiously peering over the edge of the boat, the monolithic ghosts of different Bog Towers were barely visible against the muted twilight.  The ferryman rowed his skiff ever closer to the inn, passing a lopsided clocktower with sagging stone gargoyles. An orange glow cast canine shadows across the stone face of a gargoyle Oswald had fixated on, and he pried his eyes towards its source.

In the distance, the lights of what appeared to be a boarding house emanated over the cold waters. On the ground level of the building (or at least the lowest level above water), A wide mouth lined with brick teeth yawned above the rickety dock. Against the smoggy sky the weathered building took on the visage of a giant corpse’s head. Oswald jumped as a piece of wood splashed to the surface, jostled free from some long-forgotten structure by the current. The bargeman chuckled, and Oswald joined him hesitantly. 

“Your stop, sir!” Oswald snatched up his brown leather briefcase before disembarking the skiff. 

“How much for the ride?” 

“The ride is free, sir. '' The bargeman smiled. Oswald nodded tacitly and returned his gaze to the jack-o-lantern glow of The Liar’s Tongue. The giant corpse’s mouth agape. Its splintering tongue stretched out under Oswald’s feet . He took two steps across the dock and stopped. Feeling his pockets frantically for the shape of his wire-rimmed bifocals, Oswald turned back towards the bargeman. “Wait!” he yelled.
 
But the boat and its lone crewmate had already vanished, swallowed by the dense curtain of mist. 

“Shit…” Oswald buttoned his threadbare blazer as he climbed the stairs to the inn. Above him on an upstairs window sill, a small handful of wildflowers wilted in pot soil saturated by rainwater.  

While he expected a break from the dense air outside, The air within the tavern offered little refuge. Twenty tables in total filled shallow alcoves along the tavern’s perimeter, spaced between iron torches. From each alcove wafted the sweet yet crisp scent of imported tobacco, which perfumed the air to its own (much drier)saturation. Oswald found the room comparable to an opium den he once visited in his early adulthood. Comparable... save for the patrons’ eyes. 

Behind thin scrims of parchmentine smoke, fully alert eyes followed Oswald to the bar like those of an Oracle Panther waiting to strike. Keeping his eyes affixed to the ebony wood and brass rivets of the bar, he gingerly sat himself on one of the aged stools.

 “Do you have any coffee?” Oswald muttered though he felt as though he was not consciously forming the words. The barmaid, a woman of about sixty, stared at him with steely blue eyes that shrank his heart like a raisin. 

“I know why you’re here.”

If there was anything Oswald had expected the stony barmaid to say, it certainly was not that. Once again Oswald’s mouth began attempting to conjure words, but his brain halted them in his throat. What escaped his lips was a dull croak. The barmaid placed the heavy glass stein she had been polishing on the bar with a staccato clunk. 

“Trust me, lad. We all come here for the same reason. There’s only one thing that’s always different.”

Placing two callused elbows beside the frosted glass mug, she leaned in to meet Oswald’s eyes once again, her head propped on her fists.

“So what is it you’re running from?”




Rain pattered on his office window, reflecting phantom droplets onto the stacks of papers surrounding his desk. Oswald paid no mind to them, as the one in front of him was his main focus. Everything he read made him grin wider. Uncapping his pen, he scribbled his signature next to the large X at the bottom.


“You’ll give yourself arthritis if you keep doing that, you know.”


Oswald turned around to see the barmaid, silhouetted by candlelight in the doorway of his rented room. He looked down and realized he’d been cracking his knuckles. Instead of responding, he chuckled lightly. 

“Here are some extra matches for the candle” She tossed Oswald a worn matchbook with two matches missing from it. Inscribed on the front cover was a sketch of the Bog Clock Tower. 

“Thank you,” Oswald said, placing it on the nightstand beside the bed. The barmaid bid Oswald goodnight and began pulling the creaking wooden door closed. 

“Don’t feel as though you have to tell me what you’ve run away from.” Her whisper was almost motherly, and Oswald felt his shoulders instinctively relax.

“ We all find out sooner or later.” And she was gone. 



Twixt the obelisks of moral thinking and beastly intentions, the Fates gathered by candlelight. Their cloaks fluttered against the wind, black as space and ominous as things to come. They placed a single thread between the three of them, clean and silken as a virgin’s skin. This thread had yet to see hardship or corruption and shone as brightly as the day it was conceived. With tongues laden with blisters and boils, lips cracked and blackened by centuries of speaking vile truths they chanted burning curses In accents seldom heard by human ears.
 


“Isss it awake?” A voice cooed, as if from a dream. 
Oswald’s eyes shot open, and for a moment he lay completely still, debating if he had in fact dreamed it. Light footsteps from the hallway caused Oswald to turn his head to the door of the room.

 “Ahhhhhh…”
 
The door creaked open slowly, and Oswald was greeted with the form of a boy, no more than 10 years old. As the child entered the room on feet that glowed like moonbeams, Oswald noticed the intricate crown perched on its head. Crafted from a mixture of sculpted metal and animal bone, a large teardrop emerald shone bright at its center. 
“So it isss awaaake.”

 Oswald found himself sitting up against the headboard in a feeble attempt to escape the ghostly figure. 

“Get away!” The ghost did not respond but instead sat down on Oswald's bed. 

“Whaaaat is itssss name?” the ghost’s milky eyes saw Oswald without looking at him. Shaking, he responded 

“O-Oswald.”

“Ahhhhhh…” The boy’s sigh sounded amused. 

“What is your name?” The ghost smiled at Oswald’s question 

“Don’t…knoooow” Oswald’s face dropped from frightened to confused. 

“You don’t know your own name?” 

“Don’t rememmmmber… know that it was given to me before the kingdom fell.” There was a long silence, and Oswald found that he could not make eye contact with the specter. He felt that if he were to look into its empty eyes, he might go mad with guilt. It finally broke the silence.
 “How many did you kill?” Oswald flinched at the question. 

“What do you mean?” 

“Mosssst who come here have come because they are killerssss…”

 “Well I am not one of them. '' The child tilted its head. Oswald swallowed deeply. This child’s blind eyes saw more than he ever hoped to give away.

 “Who did you kill?”  Oswald muttered, his voice devoid of any power. 

“ Killed my mmmmother when I was bornnnn… then killed my father once I was old enough to draw a sswordd…” Oswald and the ghost sat in silence for a while. Outside, a light rain had started pattering against the windows. Finally the ghost spoke. 

“Do you regrrret whhhat you’ve done?”

 “Why?” Oswald asked. 

“There is a way… To return.” Oswald’s eyes lit up. 

“What do you mean, ‘return’?”

The child rose and walked towards the door. Its glowing form began to fade.

 “Reverse the sands of time… undo your wrongs…” 

It was no more than a face hovering in the darkness. 

“Beat the drum…”


Oswald awoke with a start, though his preceding sleep was remarkably calm. Gathering himself and slowing his breathing, Oswald investigated each corner of the room, now lit in the overcast grey of what constituted daylight in Bog Tower. In the light emanating from the rain-drenched windows, no sign of a ghostly child could be found. A dream, then. Rising from the creaky bed and quickly dressing himself, he vaguely smelled something burning.


The motherly barmaid had disappeared from behind the bar, replaced with a stout, squirrely-looking man with a nose turned bright crimson by years of strong drink. Hoping to set himself down a similar path, Oswald sat on the same stool he had the previous night. 

“Anything I can fetch you, sir?” The man said, flashing a smile from a mouth of white, straight teeth.

 “A drink.”

“Any drink?”

 “Something to calm a troubled mind.” A moment passed, then a glass half full of clear liquid slid in front of Oswald, who swiftly emptied its fiery contents.

 “What is it that troubles you, my thirsty friend?” His glass was once again filled. 

“Nothing really, just… a bad dream.” 

The man said nothing, but his smile widened. “Those tend to be commonplace around here. After a while they all sort of…blend together.” 

As the liquor once again passed his lips, Oswald eyed the collection of artifacts hanging just above the walls of the bar, resting upon the dusty wooden lip which separated the stone bar walls from the dark rafters. the skull of an Oracle Panther gazed down at him, its full tusks poking over the edge of the shelf. An instrument that resembled a telescope sat beside it, with the extendable body replaced with a spotted brass globe, a gilded planet encircled by two rings. His gaze passed daggers, scrolls, bottles housing unnatural and indistinct masses.

 Oswald’s breath caught in his throat, and he felt his stomach sink like so many anchors that dropped every day along the Bog Tower canals. As thunder rumbled from outside the bar, he recognized the shape of a crown, constructed of animal bone and twisted metal, with a bright emerald at its center. Leaning against it.

Was a drum.

The virgin thread, now a sickly gray, was held taut between the aged claws of the Fates. In another of their talons, A pair of shears, rusted from eons of galactic weather and the dripping of liquid evil which seeped from their flesh like water through the boards of a sinking ship. Though they cut thousands of cords every earthly minute, they gained no small amount of pleasure from the thought of cutting this one. It was a thread of learned and deliberate evil. The shears closed on the string.

It did not split though

Something happened that even the omnipotent Fates could never foresee. As the witches watched in feral confusion, the thread began to expand, branching and creeping like the roots of some vast, unnatural tree. 


“The wood has never been identified,” the man with the white teeth said, tilting the drum to show off the barrel which made up its shell. “It originally came to us from a distant place.” 

“How distant?” 

“No one knows for sure. In fact, we don’t even know who delivered it. It had been stuck in among our other casks and no one paid any mind to it.” Oswald attempted to examine the drum. He wished he had his bifocals.

 “Here” the bartender handed him a small magnifying glass. “Take a closer look.”

As Oswald held the glass before the drum, he suddenly realized that the wood it was composed of was not nearly as dark as he had initially assumed. From a distance, the drum appeared to be fashioned from dark gray, ashen wood. Upon closer inspection, however, the wood was actually a yellowish-white, not unlike that of a birch tree. 

What gave the barrel drum its dark complexion were the vast and intricate carvings that lined it. Some extensive and gaudy, some simple and ritualistic, all measured only a centimeter or two thick. Even so, nearly every inch of the drum was covered in these esoteric glyphs. 

“Have you any idea what these markings mean?” Oswald asked. The man chuckled. 

“You overestimate my knowledge as a simple barman, my friend.” 

“Truly, it is a masterpiece” 

“That it is.” The bartender raised the drum over his shoulder and began to return it to its spot in the rafters. That was when the words of the phantom child rang loud against the back of his skull.

 “Beat the drum”

“Wait!” Oswald called out after the bartender, who turned with an expression that might have been delight. The air flexed as Oswald reached out and touched the drum.

The air was thin, and Oswald struggled to suck it into his heaving lungs. How could he have ever known it would come to this? He buried his head in his hands and slumped back against his office door. Outside that door, panicked yelling and muffled sobs. So many lost in an instant. And Oswald knew exactly why.

“Strike it hard, right here” The bartender pointed to the very center of the skin head of the drum. Oswald nodded. 

“Are you sure this will work?” The bartender said nothing, but stepped back, far away from Oswald and the ethereal drum. Oswald raised his hand. With the air once again swelling and vibrating around him, he struck. 

A dark sea engulfed him, thicker than water. No light penetrated this void, yet an electric blizzard of white bubbles and specks swirled around Oswald, an entire sky of shooting stars. The only sound, sharp and deafening, was the beating of the drum. What had started as a simple strike had evolved into an intricate cadence Oswald knew he was not capable of playing. He watched his hands strike down in a frenzy upon the barrel-drum’s head. Paradiddles, polyrhythms, crescendo, diminuendo, faster, faster, faster

Stop.

Oswald was breathing heavily, and raising a hand to his brow realized he was sweating. Flecks of light danced in the corners of his vision. He raised his head and realized exactly where the drum had brought him. He sat in a dark, yet strikingly clean corridor, which opened behind him into a sprawling office space. In front of him, light spilled from the window of one door. In stenciled gold letters upon this door:

Oswald Peng
Operations Director 
Driskol & Floute Mining Company 

He tried the knob and found it unlocked. Without hesitation, he gently pushed the door open.

Rain pattered on the office window, and the lamp attached to the ceiling fan cast yellow light onto the stacks of paper surrounding his desk. Oswald scanned the stacks, searching for one paper. The one. That very wretched document that had brought him to Bog Tower, to the Liar’s Tongue, to the drum. 

He spotted it. Sitting in the center of his desk, the bottom line clean and unsigned. Oswald let out a small, triumphant laugh, as he raised it to his eye level. With the liberating frenzy of tears, the document lay shredded on the deep green carpet. Oswald could finally breathe. He had liberated himself from his personal hell. He had stopped any accountability before it had the chance to start. He was safe. Now there would be no mine explosion. No flurry of lawsuits. No protest. No bankruptcy. No consequences. Relieved, Oswald sat down in his desk chair and took a moment to gaze out at the dark, stormy sky…

It hadn’t been nighttime when he signed the document. Why was it dark now? Why were his office lights on? Dread slowly closed Oswald’s throat once again. This wasn’t right. Somehow this cursed drum had sent him to a time and place in which he had never lived, and would never have lived. Whatever course of events he had just altered, it was not his own. Before Oswald knew it he was throwing open the office door he had thought was his, and running down the hallway back to the drum. Wrenching it up into his arms, he struck it once again.

Another flurry of rudiments cast into the engulfing void, and Oswald found himself once again running towards his office door. Inside, rain pattered against the windows, reflecting phantom droplets onto the piles of paper surrounding his desk. He had no time to take notice, however. Picking up the document from the correct desk, at the correct time, in the correct place, Oswald placed the document in his back pocket. Considering it was the same document, all he need do is place this fresh version in place of the torn one and all would be well. Confidently, he reached out to grab the drum. Oswald missed entirely, merely rapping his knuckles against the rim. He panicked as he watched the drum topple onto its side with a muffled boom.

Oswald and the drum stood in a pitch-black corridor. Reaching out, Oswald felt that the walls of this corridor were fashioned of stone. Beneath his feet he felt similar stone. This was not right. Oswald’s fingers moved from stone to thick fabric along the wall. A tapestry? Was this some sort of castle? A light came from under a door at one end of the hallway. Oswald snatched up the drum and prepared to hide, holding his breath. The door never opened. Instead, a feeble scream came from behind the door. The sound of metal hitting stone. A deep sound like a piece of furniture being knocked over. Another scream, cut off. Silence. Oswald gathered what little nerve he had left and frantically struck the drum.

 The morning sun peeked through his office windows. Not right either . Racking his brain, Oswald remembered that he had struck the drum precisely on its eastmost rim when he was sent to the first office. He breathed deeply and felt his hand strike precisely the same place in the exact same manner. 

The void gave way one final time, and Oswald placed the fresh document on his own desk for the last time. Finally well and fully relieved, he pulled open his office door.

The drum was gone.

At that exact moment, audible across multiple universes, causing the very Fates to shudder with a bastardization of fear, a growl like the implosion of a dwarf star. 

For you see, Oswald’s tampering with the very fate that had doomed him had awoken something no mortal man could face 

In the void, a massive shape stirred.

The wall of Oswald’s office building exploded, crumbling out into the emptiness of space.

Before Oswald, the form of a massive spectral dog appeared, shrouded by the trails of comets and as massive as three suns placed lengthwise. Oswald felt its eyes, nothing more than two piercingly bright stars, shining horrible beams of pale light through every inch of his body, gripping his brain like a child gripping a wet sponge. He nearly convulsed and fell on his knees before the ethereal hellhound. 

In his brain, words appeared as though written on a chalkboard, spoken without a voice.

“ You do not belong here.”

Oswald was paralyzed, no part of his body functioning anymore. His nerve endings burned like kerosene-soaked rope. 

No more words came to him, but looking into these creature’s eyes, one feeling saturated every pore of his skin and vibrated a deep baritone in the joints between his bones 

Hunger 

The Hellhound was hungry, and it had come to feed on this universe. A universe no human would ever see. A universe born through decision.

Oswald collapsed, and every cell in his body separated. Every element of him was torn apart and hurled back into the void. Proteins, bacteria, paramecia, genes, all erased in an instant.

The Hellhound feasted on the flesh of the world left behind. A world born of choices never meant to be chosen. 

The fates returned to hiding, sheltered by the words of fiction and mythology.  
Somewhere, tucked away in a decrepit town brought about by the powers of regret; forgot by all but those who wish to be forgotten. 

In the rafters, among powerful and mysterious objects imbued with the power of mortal mistakes. 

The Rum Barrel drum, the instrument of toppled kingdoms and the bane of broken men, waited, Silent.

Patient.

1ol6036,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Nearby-Sprinkles3242/comments/1ol6036/my_realtor_friend_was_crying_over_listing/,My realtor friend was crying over listing descriptions at 11pm. So I taught her AI prompts. Here’s what actually worked.,"Okay, so this summer, my best friend Raya, who has been selling houses for eight years, had a complete meltdown in my living room. Full-on ugly cry at 11:47 p.m. because she had seven listing descriptions due by morning and her brain was fried. I’m not a realtor. I just mess around with AI prompts for fun (yes, I’m that person 🤓). So I offered to help.

Her immediate response: “It’ll sound like a robot wrote it!” Fair. Because here’s what AI gives you by default: Charming 3-bedroom home with modern updates and great potential.”

AKA every listing description ever written. So we spent 6 months testing prompts. Some worked. Some were hilariously bad. One made her sound like she was selling a property on The Bachelor.

What actually worked:

1. Lifestyle Over Features Instead of: “4-bedroom colonial with updated kitchen” We got: “Picture Saturday mornings in this kitchen - your coffee brewing while the kids are already outside with the dog you’ve been promising them. This isn’t just a house. It’s where your Sunday traditions start.”

Prompt: “Write a listing for \[property\] focusing on what life feels like here. Target: \[buyer type\]

2. Relatable Social Content Because “JUST LISTED 🏠✨” gets zero engagement.

Prompt: Give me 5 relatable captions about \[situation\] that show personality without being cringe.

Output: POV: Your client just asked if they should waive the inspection on a house built in 1972. And they’re serious. Her engagement went from her mom + 3 pity likes to actual conversations.

3. Un-Desperate Follow-Ups Old way: Just checking in! New way: Hey, saw rates dropped - reminded me of that Oak Street property you loved. Worth a quick chat?

What flopped: •	Having AI write entire strategies (generic garbage) •	Fancy vocabulary (nobody says “quintessential” in real life) •	Using it without editing (AI is your assistant, not your replacement) The Results: •	Listing descriptions: 2 hours → 10 minutes •	Social content: batched in 45 minutes every Monday •	Q4 was her best quarter in 3 years

Here’s the thing: While we were figuring this out, Sarah noticed other top agents were suddenly everywhere on social media. Always posting. Always having the right words.

She asked how they were doing it. They were using AI. They just weren’t talking about it.

So what’s eating up YOUR time? Listing descriptions? Social media? Client emails?

Not trying to sell anything - just figured if this helped Sarah avoid the 11pm crying-on-my-couch situation, maybe it helps someone else. Also fully prepared to get roasted if this is the dumbest thing you’ve read today. I’m here for it. 🤷‍♀️

(Part Three),"[(Part Two)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ojjbz8/everyones_getting_replaced_by_imposters_and_i/)

[(Part One)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oignt2/everyones_getting_replaced_by_impostors_and_i/)

I found a scrap of paper in Wes's room. That's where I'm sitting right now, at his desk. The paper says 'How to tell the imposters: 1. Creepy smile 2. Weird behavior. They change depending on who they're talking to. 3. They use' That's all it says. Something- or someone tore off the rest. Maybe even him. I don't know.

A lot has happened in the past few hours. Not so much, I would say as yesterday, but it feels like a lot. I'm exhausted. I was sitting up all night, terrified that whatever got Beck would get me. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his pale face, floating in whatever that liquid was. The one or two times I drifted off, I'd wake up a few minutes later, my leg burning in pain.

This morning I went outside to start walking to school. As I walked by Wes’s house, he sprinted out of the door. 

“Hey Calanthe!” He said cheerfully, wearing his backpack the wrong way around so he could look through it. “I found something else- hey is your leg okay? You’re limping like crazy.“

”Wow, thanks Wes.” I roll my eyes. “Yeah, my leg feels like it’s being rolled in fire, but I’m fine.”

”Here, lean on me some.” I snort. 

”Really?”

”Really! We can get you crutches when we get to school.” He grins at me. 

I raise my eyebrow as he grabs my arm and puts it around his shoulders. ”So, you seem…awfully chipper today. What‘s up?” 

”I think I figured out how to save Beckett.” He starts digging through his bag, and I narrowly dodged an elbow to the chin. ”Oops!- You know what, I’ll just tell you during study hall. We should just get to school. We keep going at this pace we‘ll be late.”

I nodded, then paused. “Hey Wes?”

He tilted his head. “Yeah?”

”I forgot what line it was we were talking about yesterday, do you remember?” I was crossing my fingers, silently pleading ‘Please remember, please remember, please be Wes.’

His brow wrinkled in confusion for a second, and I was about ready to bolt, injured leg or not. Then his face lit up. “Oh, right! Almost forgot. I solemnly swear I’m not a bloody crank.” He grins at me. “Satisfied?”

I nod, stifling a yawn. He helped me all the way to school, and then practically shoved people out of the way to get to the nurse’s office to get me crutches. It was really nice of him, and I couldn’t help but think that maybe he was trying to help me in order to try to kind of make up for not being able to help Beck. 

I snuck a text to Andy during math, letting her know that she’d have to pick me up because I couldn’t walk to the bus stop with my leg. She texted back that that was fine, and then I got caught and had to turn in my phone. 

Study hall was at the end of the day, so I didn‘t see Wes for most of the day. When I finally did, he quickly waved me over to a corner. I hobbled over and sat next to him.

”So? What’d you find?” I asked impatiently. He grinned again.

”Aliens. It has to be. That pod was totally alien, right?”

I sighed. “Not this again. You were so mad yesterday about Beck. I can’t believe you’re joking about this again.”

He frowned “It’s not a joke, I’m serious. I wouldn’t joke about this. I want to get Beckett out of there as soon as I can. You‘re the one who said to do the research. I’ve done the research, okay?“

I crossed my arms. “Invasion of the Body Snatchers is not research, Wes.”

He seemed to be getting frustrated. “No, I did actual research, Calanthe, and I found something. What are you doing after school?”

”Andy’s driving me to a coffee shop so we can talk about this.”

”Oh.” He frowns. “Then come with me to the library, I’ll show you the article.“

Before I could respond, he had jumped up and asked for library passes, then ran over and helped me up. When we got to the library, he rushed over to a laptop, pulling up an article. 

“See? Aliens.” He said, pointing to the article. It detailed something that looked like a meteor crashing in the nearby mountains. I frowned. “What, mad that I’m right?”

”How are we the first to notice anything?”

”We aren’t. There’s a ton of online boards buzzing about it. It makes sense, see? That‘s where me and Beckett were hiking! I bet Cyndi was around there too. I say we go and check it out.”

I nodded. ”We could say that we’re hiking, get some rangers to come with us.“

He nods, beaming ear to ear. “We can make them fix Beckett.”

I grinned back. Just then the bell rang. “Oh, I gotta-“

”Yeah, let’s get you to Alexandria.“

I froze. 

“What? She’ll be wondering where you are!”

”Andy.” I said slowly. He paused, looking at me.

”What?”

”You‘ve never met her. I don’t really talk about her. Every time I do, I call her Andy. You wouldn’t know she’s a girl. Everyone assumes she’s a boy named Andrew.” He paused, realizing his error. “Even if you knew she was a girl, the assumption is Andrea.”

He shook his head. “Damn.” I backed away. “I was so close, wasn’t I?” He asked with a grin. How could I have not seen it earlier? 

“You’re not Wes.” I whispered. 

“Nope!” He said cheerfully. ”And, Calanthe, no point in running. We’re faster than you even without your leg.” 

I didn’t care. I chucked one crutch at him and took off, trying to ignore the pain in my leg. I could tell, though, that the sprint wouldn’t last long, and that I probably only had about thirty seconds before I wouldn’t even be able to walk. 

I slid down the bannister, refusing to look behind me, landing awkwardly on my leg and falling to the ground. I rolled and got back up, hobbling with the one crutch and leg, to see Andy sitting in her car. For the second time this week, I dove into her backseat, crying out as my leg slammed against the seat. 

”Just go! Go to my house, not the coffee shop, he knows where that is.” I panted. Andy looked confused, but listened, starting to drive. 

I looked out the window to see the fake Wes leaning against the doorway to the school. He seemed unfazed, and was grinning coolly. He gave me a jaunty little wave when he saw me. 

I understood why he was so calm. He knew where I lived, he knew where I was going, he knew Andy and I were the only two loose ends left. If it was even Andy I was with right now.

”Andy,” I said wearily, not sure what I would do if she was not her, “Just tell me honestly, are you you?”

She gave me a funny look in the rear view. “Uh, yeah? You okay, Callie?”

I shook my head. “Yeah, fine. Wes got replaced. If you’re not you, I don’t care anymore, just take me.”

She gave a little awkward laugh. “Well I am me, so hopefully that’s okay too.”

We got to my house, and instead of going to mine, I paused. Wes and Beck would be at practice to avoid suspicion. 

I went into their house. As I suspected, empty. I limped up to Wes’s room and looked in the hidden compartment in his closet. I was the only one he had ever shown. He joked once that if he started smoking or doing drugs, that’d be where he hid them. I checked it every once in a while to make sure he wasn’t actually smoking or anything stupid like that. 

Inside I found the paper I mentioned earlier. It looked like it had been ripped from a notebook, but which one I couldn’t guess. I’m sitting on his bed crying. I don’t know what to do. That seems to be a common theme, but really, I’m truly lost at this point. Andy’s downstairs, waiting on the porch for me to come back downstairs. I’m going down as soon as I post this. If I don’t update, you’ll know what happened to me. Keep your eyes open for anyone acting weird, and stay far away from them.",2,1761944064.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Back in **2015**, my then-girlfriend asked me if I wanted to go to Tawang. I couldn't make it, but one of the pictures, the massive, **snowy Tawang Monastery,** stayed with me. A full decade later, I was finally going to see that legend!

It was the three of us, riding our motorcycles - one Honda NX500, one Honda CB350, and one Triumph Scrambler 400X. We were ready to trade Kolkata's crazy humidity and noise for the high-altitude, chilly vibes of **Arunachal**. Ready. Set. Go!

# Day 1: The Long Night to Alipurduar (October 17th)

We **kicked things off** at **10 PM sharp** on October 17th, starting from Bengal Chemical. We planned to ride all night, aiming for **Alipurduar**. That's a huge distance, a brutal **710 kilometers**!

We made some huge mistakes right away. First, I completely forgot about the infamous **Farakka bridge**. It was incredibly difficult! The truck queue was backed up for about **10 kilometers** on both sides! Negotiating that exhausted us early. Second fail: the **Falakata - Alipurduar stretch**. It was all torn up and under construction, a proper nightmare after riding all night. After a tough **17 hours** straight, we finally rolled into Alipurduar at **3 PM** the next day. We were absolutely done, but hey, we conquered the **710 km**!

# Day 2: Alipurduar to Bhairabkunda

We woke up and got an early start from Alipurduar, well before the city was even buzzing. Today's goal was **Bhairabkunda**. Google Maps tried to tempt us with all sorts of crazy shortcuts. Wisely, we talked to the locals and decided to just stick to the main highway. Best decision ever! We cruised into Bhairabkunda ShiLoh homestay by **3 PM** and happily **called it a day**.

# Day 3: Hello, Arunachal! (Bhairabkunda to Dirang)

Leaving our Homestay at **5:15 AM**, we started early. The roads were deserted in the quiet darkness. We zoomed right up to the **Balemu check post**, our entry into Arunachal. The guard looked tired and just waved us through without even checking our permits! Just like that, we were in the ""Land of the Rising Sun!""

We made good time climbing and hit **Kalaktang** by **7:15 AM**. We desperately needed fuel, but the Indian Oil pump didn't open until **8:00 AM**. We used the time for breakfast and tanked up.

From there, it was onwards to the **Mandala Top**. The road was nice at first, but it quickly fell apart after the **Phudong Monastery**. It got narrow and broken and really slowed our pace. We pushed through and finally reached the spectacular Mandala Top around **12:30 PM**. The view was stunning! We spent a solid two hours there just taking photos, we couldn't help it! Our destination was **Dirang**, and we finally reached our stay at **5 PM**.

# Day 4: Tawang Bound!

We were so **excited**! We left Dirang at **6 AM**. The highway was in fantastic shape, so we took it easy, mostly because I ride slow in the mountains! We stopped at **Baishakhi** for a quick coffee and to chill with the view.

Soon, we turned off the main road for the legendary **Sela Pass**. By **9:15 AM**, we were at the official gate of Tawang! We hit a major brake when we reached the beautiful **Sela Lake**. We spent a whopping three hours there, just staging our bikes and clicking probably **500 pictures**. We knew we wouldn't be back soon! After another quick photoshoot stop right after the lake, we got moving.

We checked out the **Jashwantgarh War Memorial**, grabbed lunch, and then finally rode into **Tawang**. Our day ended at the cozy **Norlha Homestay**. Mission totally accomplished!

# Day 5: High-Altitude Drama at Bumla Pass (15,000+ ft)

The night before was **very stressful**! There was a total mix-up with our **Bumla Pass permit,** some random name was added. We called the agent, and thankfully, it was sorted **quickly**. We were promised the permits by 6:45 AM.

We were up by 5 AM and got the crucial permits by **7 AM** as promised. We started the intense climb at **8 AM**. We zipped past gorgeous high-altitude lakes and reached the **Y-Junction** by 8:45 AM. Beyond the junction, the Army checked our permits and IDs twice. We reached the famous **Bumla Pass** at **10 AM**. I was thrilled, my bike hit **15,000 feet** for the first time!

At the **LAC (Line of Actual Control)** border, they briefed us about the area and the **1962 war**. It was intense; we even saw a Chinese soldier walk over toward the line to observe us! The Army doesn't allow selfies, but they took one official photo of every tourist.

Then things got **intense**. During the briefing, I was suddenly hit by **AMS** (Altitude Sickness). I felt like I was going to pass out! It was a genuine panic moment. But thank goodness for those **camphor tablets,** they saved me. We hurried back to the canteen for some essential hot **Maggi and Jalebi**. That whole scare seriously shook us up.

Back in Tawang, we quickly visited the **Monastery** and the **Buddha Statue Park**, took some photographs, and then crashed back at the homestay. We all needed to sleep.

# Day 6: Off-Roading Hell and Lumla

Everyone felt much better today! We started bright and early at **6:30 AM**. We took the same route back to the **Y-Junction**, but this time we hung a left. We stopped briefly at the **Gurudwara** and then cruised to **Sangetsar Lake (Madhuri Lake)** for another fun photoshoot.

From the lake, we turned off toward the **Taktsang Gompa (T-Gompa)**. Then the road **disappeared**. The descent from the Gompa gave us the toughest **10 kilometers** of the entire trip. The road was being rebuilt, meaning it was just thick, loose gravel, stones, and huge boulders. Zero traction! My tires were all over the place! It felt like forever, but after that hour, the conditions improved, and we got some speed back.

We reached the **Gorsam Chorten** by **12 noon**. Luckily, a government guest house was under construction there, so we were able to freshen up. We then headed to **Lumla**, reached the beautiful **Tara Devi statue** at **3 PM**, and spent about 30 minutes there before starting the ride back toward Tawang.

# Day 7: Tawang Marathon Mix-up and Bomdila

We were going to leave Tawang early and stay in **Shergaon**. But the **Tawang Marathon** totally messed up our plans! Traffic rules restricted all vehicles from leaving until **12 noon**. **What a delay!**

That delay meant Shergaon was out; we had to stop at **Bomdila** to avoid a dangerous night ride. Once we were finally free, the highway was incredible, especially the stretch from Dirang to Bomdila. It was some of the best scenic riding of the trip.

We rolled into Bomdila by **5 PM**. We found the **Orchid Homestay** right outside town, checked in fast, had a quiet dinner, and went to bed. Leaving Tawang felt heavy, and we knew we still had another **1200 km** of riding ahead.

# Day 8: Bomdila to Bongaigaon

We got an early start again. After fueling up, we began our ride down to the plains. By **1:00 PM**, we waved goodbye to the mountains at **Bhairabkunda**. We continued riding and stopped for a late lunch break at **Baihata Chariali**. Sticking strictly to the highways, we reached **Bongaigaon** by **7 PM** and were happy to check into a hotel for the night.

# Day 9: Bongaigaon to Malda

This was just a long haul day, safe riding focused purely on eating up distance. We rode consistently and stopped for the night by **7 PM** after reaching **Malda**, finding a convenient hotel right before the highway bypass. **Whew.**

# Day 10: The Finish Line in Kolkata

With only **350 km** left, we hoped to be home by lunchtime! Unfortunately, the heavy speed checking on the **Kalyani Expressway** slowed us down a lot. We finally rolled into Kolkata at **2:00 PM**, completing the full circuit!

I got this for my Alu-Cab Canopy Camper on a Jeep Gladiator, mostly to run lights, a fridge, chargers, and a small fan when I’m tucked away at a campsite. After two weeks, it’s doing what it’s supposed to do and hasn’t given me any surprises. It runs my setup smoothly and feels pretty straightforward to use.

Before this, I had a handful of Jackery units. They always worked fine, just pricey once you add solar, so this time I grabbed two 100W panels with the unit. The weather has been nothing but rain lately, so my solar test has basically been watching raindrops hit panels while I drink coffee and pretend this is still “outdoor adventure.” Once the sun comes back, I’ll see how it does next to the Jackery panels and report back.

First impression when unboxing: it’s heavy. Not unmanageable, but definitely “bend your knees or regret it later” heavy. I knew a 2000W battery wasn’t going to feel like a lunchbox, yet somehow it still surprised me when I tried lifting it with one hand. The footprint is compact for the capacity, and the metal casing and handles make it feel like something that’s meant to be tossed around in a truck bed and still survive. The screen is easy to read and the port layout makes sense, especially when living in a confined camper setup, since you don’t end up with every cable sticking out the front like a cyber-hedgehog.

Price-wise, I paid roughly what a 1500W unit from bigger brands would cost, so on paper it’s a good value. That said, I really want to emphasize something: most people probably don’t need a 2000W power station. It’s really tempting to see gear like this and picture yourself living off-grid in the mountains, running power tools in the middle of nowhere, and surviving disasters with quiet confidence, when the reality for a lot of folks is a few weekend trips, a portable coffee setup, and charging phones. If your camping looks more like picnic tables and campgrounds than remote desert trails, a smaller unit or a couple of power banks might make more sense.

I’m not knocking the product at all, just saying it’s easy to get swept up in gear hype, and this thing is both big and not cheap. It’s great for what I need because I camp often and work remotely sometimes, but it’s not something I’d recommend buying “just in case” or because a YouTuber made van-life look romantic. Realistically, most of us don’t want to haul a heavy battery around unless we truly need the capacity.

I’ll update again after more real-world use and once I get proper sun to test the solar charging. If it holds up long-term, then it’ll feel like money well spent. For now, the early verdict is solid performance, but don’t buy one of these monsters unless it actually fits your lifestyle instead of your imagination.",2,1761943345.0,BuyItForLife,0,0.67,False

**XIII: Ghosts**

Thilo's condition is deteriorating rapidly, occasionally delirious, he claims ""*the landscape kills*"". Wojnicz spends his time there every day to care for him as much as possible and hold his hand. While his friend is sleeping, Wojnicz examines the De Bles landscape painting in detail. He is unable to cry because of his father's conditioning but still he mourns Thilo. While showing Thilo his herbal collection and trying to be cheerful, Thilo asks to be hugged and they embrace, which brings back so many happy sensations to Wojnicz and then, Thilo kisses him and bequeaths him the De Bles painting stolen from his family.


Wojnicz has been feeling poorly, the lectures from the elders are getting repetitive, talking about the decline of civilization in tandem with tuberculosis infecting the body politic. The Schwarmerei goes around and they discuss the nature of ghosts. Strange...no discussion of women??


Wojnicz sinks into routine, the Kurhaus, walks, visit Thilo, spend some time with one of his elders. Thilo's friend is telegrammed to come quickly. Opitz suggests an outing to Heuriger, a famous local restaurant. August invites him for a pre-drink and confronts Wojnicz about his dual nature of ""Jupiter and Venus"" but he is not interested in discussing it.


Off to the restaurant, while Wojnicz watches through half-closed eyes and beholds the landscape. The delicious smelling stew is served after copious drinking and, yes, it is another surprise disgusting treat! They also sample the local Schwarmerei which is very different and of the forest. Wojnicz asks for seconds and then finds out the stew is made of terrified rabbit hearts, which died of heart attacks...which he can't keep down. 

Back to the attic, Wojnicz discovers a strange scene, like one from the forest where mushrooms are growing in abundance. He begins to coo as he inhales the spores and collects mushrooms for himself, vowing not to share the secret, even as something moves in the corner of his vision.



**XIV: A Temperature Chart**


Wojnicz swears off Schwarmerei after the heart stew. He thinks the liquor is messing with time and perception. He pretends to drink it with everyone. The rain swells the river. Wojnicz manages to avoid interacting with August, Lukas or Frommer and takes long walks out of the way to think of his past and begin distancing himself from it. He now enjoys the cooing and spends afternoons trying on Mrs. Opitz clothes. 

Thilo considers his temperature chart which matches the mountain peaks there, repeating his thesis that this landscape was actively killing people. He asks for his friend Gyorgy, who is already en route and denies his parents, who didn't love him. He tells Wojnicz they are in danger and points out the De Bles painting, which he has wrapped up and tucked away, reminding him to take it and keep it. 

Thilo's friend, ""Kai""/Gyorgy arrives and Wojnicz brings him to Thilo's room. His friend is distraught by Thilo's condition. When Wojnicz leaves the room, he hears the nurse utter a slur. 

Thilo is dead the next morning. Wojnicz is terrified and bereft. He cannot stand to see anyone, but sneaks in his pj's to grab the painting. He recalls Thilo's words to look not only with the eyes, but with the mind and watches Thilo's funeral procession as well as Opitz and Raimond scheming. 


Around noon, Wojincz gets dressed and goes out for a walk, ending up by the Orthodox church. He looks at the icon one more time and notices how protective Saint Emerentia's robe is. It brings back memories of his mother's fur coat. 


Back at the Guesthouse, he runs into August and Gyorgy, who questions him about a valuable object that might have been left for him by Thilo. Wojnicz, despite himself, denies any knowledge of the object. 



**XV: The Weakest Spot in the Soul**


Wojnicz goes to see Dr. Semperweiss and bares everything. Expecting the worst, instead, Dr. Semperweiss gives him some wise and philosophical advice and is quite jolly about it and offers Wojnicz a ride in his female Mercedes when he gets back from his trip. Wojnicz can't take it lightly and confesses the best thing would be is to die here, as his father intended. Dr. Semperweiss reassures him that normality is abnormal and promises he'll be home for Christmas.

In delight, Wojnicz goes to the cafe to get cakes, sees his favorite behatted lady. He sees Frommer in the cafe and he warns Wojnicz to get as far away as possible. Wojnicz wants to know more. Frommer gives him the details about Mrs. Opitz's death and the fact the old ways are still near. ""*All the wrongs that happened in the past have not ceased to exist, they continue to resonate and make us tremble inside*"". As they have cake and coffee, Frommer blurts out that the Tuntschi used to take members of the community, so the community became a place for invalids who could be delivered in their stead. Thilo was to be this year's sacrifice, but he died too soon. Was Wojnicz next?

He is enjoying Dr. Semperweiss's words and the sugar rush, which bring him back to Gliceria's [**kogel mogel**](https://www.thespruceeats.com/polish-eggnog-kogel-mogel-recipe-1135662) and considers he could begin afresh from Gliceria's kitchen. Frommer ends the tete-a-tete with a downer. 
 


**XVI. A Person in One Shoe**



Wojinicz is woken from his afternoon nap by Raimund and now they are hiking. Wojnicz refuses to continue the walk and tries to remember why he was there! He is too lightly dressed for their walk in the woods. He turns back and Raimund whistles for help. Suddenly charcoal burners show up out of nowhere and grab him. Wojnicz is too familiar with the sensation of being surrounded and hurt. He thinks of his father and uncle who helped him prepare for this moment. He struggles until he is hit in the stomach and surrenders himself to the situation. The charcoal burners force him to drink Schwarmerei, take some of clothes and tie him to a fallen beech tree. 

Before they can remove his trousers, something comes by light and cooing, which terrifies the men. Clearly, the Tuntschi didn't approve of this sacrifice and they all run home to ""*the chairs*"". Wojnicz is still tied up and suddenly sees everything in blue and green and alive and is addressed by these forces of nature, who know him and wish him no harm. With the hand he frees, he reaches up to touch the face of one and they see all in him.

Crying and distraught, Wojnicz comes downhill, losing one shoe. From his vantage point, he sees the town and wants to hide himself. Near the Kurhouse, he sees Sydonia Patek herding a group toward the charcoal burners. Suddenly, he realizes it's all men except for the nurse. He gets back to the Guesthouse, feeling hurt, violated and cold, but is unwilling to give into despair. He hears something upstairs and, in one shoe, goes to investigate. It turns out to be Opitz, strapped in his special chair and demanding to be untied. As he tries to help, the truth comes out about what goes on in the village.

Wojnicz helps him with one strap and Opitz is wild to get free and join the others. Once he gets well dressed for the cold, Wojnicz heads outside to see what is going on. On seeing Frommer, and being unable to distract him, Wojnicz goes to Dr. Semperweiss's study to get his shot gun but the sound doesn't seem to distract anyone. He heads back to the Guesthouse but peaks into the annex, where Raimund lives. He is still firmly tied up and Wojnicz leaves him to it.

Opitz is confettied in the forest in front of an audience. Snow falls in the morning, and life begins once more. Wojnicz dresses his foot and makes his way upstairs. Undressing completely, he begins to put on boots and clothes from Mrs. Opitz and consider his options. The Tuntschi gave his lungs a clearing but his body is what it is. 

He marshals himself, gets a passport as ""Klara Opitz"" and packs up everything, including Thilo's gift. As she heads to the station, Frau Weber and Frau Brecht in front of their cottage, say goodbye in their eyes. The third sister might be like the light in the painting in the cottage. Klara reaches in her pocket for the broad bean she picked up on arriving to the city and gleefully eats it. 



**Epilogue:**


WWI seems to have satiated the Tuntschi. A vaccine for tuberculosis arrives. Klara Opitz works in a hospital kitchen and served in a field hospital on the Belgium front. She moved to Berlin after the war and then disappeared. We hear the various fates of the characters post war.

If you're reading this, you've found yourself in an unexpected place. I don't take that to mean either of us screwed up along the way. I look at the positive- we're here now trying to make our lives better/more fulfilling.

I've read a few posts like this, and they often feel like a checklist: ""Here's who I am, and here's exactly who you should be."" If relationships were that simple and predictable, why would any of us be here? I'm not looking for a pre-fabricated kit where I know how every piece fits.

Instead, I want to focus on the connection we could build. Like riding a motorbike- you don't stare at the road just in front of the wheel. You look further down the horizon to see where you're going.

This is what I see on that horizon:

**A connection:** We'd message frequently. Not necessarily every single day, but some days we'd chat throughout the afternoon and sneak away in the evening to keep the conversation going. The tone would ebb and flow—sometimes flirty and lustful, other times friendly and supportive. There's something cathartic about having a person you can share the small things with, or vent to about the current state of affairs (see orange menace).

**Meeting:** We'd aim to meet up about once a month, with the understanding that sometimes we might want to see each other more. We could get creative- maybe we arrange mornings where we take indirect routes to work to share a coffee before the day begins. While we would cherish times we could be alone in private, it wouldn't be connection for the bedroom only. We'd also work to find time for an occasional concert, a movie, or a hike on a local trail would.

**Potentially necessary details:** I'm 50, married for over 15 years, Latinx, and have one kid still at home.

1ol5lvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1ol5lvp/thoughts_about_this_potential_dating_scenario/,Thoughts about this potential dating scenario?,"I recently went to a costume party associated with the singles group and young married group of my roommates church which is the Church of Christ. There was this guy at the dance who I had met a few times over the past few years at Bible studies and past single events. We ended up talking for about 40 minutes at the costume party and it eventually resulted in him giving me his number and asking me to text him. He said he was interested in visiting my church at some point. We also danced together too.        

I texted him that night and he texted me Sunday saying he had a great time and wanted to see me again and asked me if I either wanted to get coffee or walk along the beach this week or next week. I said I was open to both and suggested Saturday. He said it would work for him after he got off work.    
      
 A few days later he texted me and asked me if he could call me to talk about the plans. I said sure. He asked if I had ever heard of encouragement dates and I said no. He said they were dates in which we went on dates with other couples from his church. He said their church has certain rules about dating such as not being in the car together. He said he wanted to change the date from this Saturday to next Saturday or Sunday so we can accommodate another couple to join us.            He                           

He said this Sunday him and some people from his church are doing to a ride share to a nearby mountain town to have church up there and asked if I wanted to accompany. I said I would be fine going on the encouragement date but had to think about Julian. I don't particularly want to do it cause there a good chance I am going to be surrounded with a bunch of people I don't know and I missed church this Sunday and was in nursery the Sunday before that.             He said the encouragement dates are for protecting purity. I thanked him for wanting to protect my purity. I asked if we were to continue going on dates if we would always be with other people and he said yes.      
                  
I am not sure how I am feeling about this. On one hand, I do want to be open cause I want to get married one day. And obviously it would be good for us to get to know our circle of friends.  On the other hand, I don't think I want all our dates to be group dates cause I think it is important to have one on one time with a boyfriend before you marry. Obviously I want to avoid certain situations that can breed unnecessary temptation. But I don't think riding in a car together before marriage is sinful or even bad. I think you just to have to be careful sitting in a car alone when neither is driving. And plus, people can act differently in group settings than in person. Sometimes people can hide bad behavior in group settings. This is why I think it is important to get quality time with someone you are dating.    What are your thoughts on all this? Is anyone familiar with the church of Christ and would you recommend me getting involved with anyone from this denomination? ",2,1761943090.0,ChristianDating,7,1.0,False

I’m pretty new to the world of “proper” shaving. My whole life it’s been cartridge razors + shaving gel, and every single time I’d end up with razor burn, ingrowns, and a neck that looked like it lost a fight. Because of that, I’d grow my beard out now and then, but… let’s just say my wife’s not the biggest fan of that look 😅.

So I decided to give this “real shaving” thing a shot. Straight razors look incredible — the craftsmanship, the ritual — but with two toddlers running around, I can barely find time to finish a cup of coffee, let alone strop and hone steel. So I picked up a Feather AC SS and some ProGuard blades, figuring that’d be a good middle ground.

Used it with my Gillette Labs gel (probably a sin in this sub, sorry). The result: let’s just say there was… a bloody learning curve. My neck grows hair in about 17 directions, so the shave wasn’t super close, but at least I didn’t get any rash — which honestly feels like a win!

Now I’m trying to figure out what’s next:
* Should I stick with the Feather and keep practicing until I master it?
* Or try to add a safety razor to build better technique first? (If so, what’s a good starter razor/blade combo?)
* And does switching to a soap + brush setup really make that much difference over gel?
* I saw many people recommend Nivea max hydration post shave balm, that’s good enough or there’re superior options??

Any tips, product recs, or general wisdom would be hugely appreciated. Love this community — you guys make even the bloody first shaves feel worth it 😂",5,1761942842.0,wicked_edge,4,1.0,False

Seeing that perhaps the majority of posts on this forum are complaints about flakey HomePod performance due to 'networking issues' on otherwise trouble-free networks, I instructed the AI to describe Apple's two networking-related design flaws in the HomePod hardware and software and how set things up to work around them.

The following is the imperfect, unedited output of the AI after making a few trys and me clarifying some facts and restating the request:

# Why Your HomePods Are Unstable and How to Fix Them

If you're experiencing constant audio dropouts, ""No Response"" errors, or Siri failures with your HomePod minis or 2nd Gen HomePods, the problem is almost certainly not your fault. It's often caused by a conflict between two core Apple design choices and how modern ""smart"" Wi-Fi routers operate.

This guide explains the technical reasons for the instability and provides a reliable, permanent workaround.

# The Two Core Problems

The instability you're seeing is typically a combination of two separate issues: a Wi-Fi protocol conflict and an identity-masking feature.

# 1. The 5GHz ""Legacy"" Problem (Band Steering)

* **The Flaw:** HomePod mini and HomePod (2nd Gen) are specified as **802.11n**. While this standard *can* operate on the 5GHz band, modern routers (which use 802.11ac/ax/be) are optimized for high-speed devices on that band. To them, an 802.11n device on the 5GHz network is a ""slow"" device that degrades performance for everyone else.
* **The Conflict:** Most modern routers use **""Band Steering""** (or ""Smart Connect"") to manage a single network name (SSID). This feature actively ""steers"" what it deems as slow devices off the 5GHz band and onto the 2.4GHz band.
* **The Result:** Your HomePod, which may try to connect to 5GHz (and may even be encouraged to during setup), gets into a constant fight with the router. The router sees it, forces it to 2.4GHz, the HomePod drops the connection, and then potentially tries to reconnect to 5GHz, starting the unstable loop all over again. This causes audio dropouts and ""No Response"" errors.

# 2. The Private Wi-Fi Address (PWA) Problem

* **The Flaw:** Apple enabled **Private Wi-Fi Address (PWA)** by default. This feature randomizes your device's MAC address (its unique hardware ID) on Wi-Fi networks. This is an excellent privacy feature for public hotspots (like a coffee shop) because it prevents tracking.
* **The Conflict:** On your *home* network, it's a disaster for smart home devices. Your router's DHCP server assigns an IP address based on the MAC address. When your HomePod's MAC address changes, your router sees it as a *brand new device* and assigns it a *new IP address*.
* **The Result:** Your HomeKit Hub (like your Apple TV) and your iPhone are now trying to send commands to an old IP address that no longer exists. The HomePod is essentially ""lost"" on the network until service discovery (Bonjour/mDNS) catches up, if it ever does. This is a primary cause of ""No Response"" errors in the Home app. For stationary devices, a stable IP and MAC address are critical.

# The Permanent Solution: Create a ""Strict"" Network for HomeKit

The fix is to take all the ""automatic"" guesswork away from both the router and the HomePods. You will create a dedicated, stable network lane for them to use.

# Step 1: Split Your Router's Wi-Fi Bands

Log into your router's administration settings. You need to disable ""Band Steering"" (or ""Smart Connect""). This will allow you to assign **different names (SSIDs)** to your 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks.

* **Example:**
   * **5GHz SSID:** `MyNetwork_5GHz`
   * **2.4GHz SSID:** `MyNetwork_2.4GHz`

# Step 2: Prepare Your iPhone for Setup

Your iPhone is the tool that passes the network settings to your HomePods. You must configure it first.

1. On your iPhone, go to **Settings > Wi-Fi**.
2. Tap the **(i)** icon next to your **5GHz network** (`MyHome_5GHz`) and turn **""Auto-Join"" OFF**. This is a temporary but crucial step to stop your phone from jumping back to 5GHz during the setup process.
3. Connect your iPhone to your **2.4GHz network** (`MyHome_2.4GHz`).
4. Tap the **(i)** icon next to *that* 2.4GHz network.
5. Turn the **""Private Wi-Fi Address""** toggle **OFF**.
6. You will see a ""Privacy Warning."" Ignore it. This is *your* secure home network, not a public one. Disabling this is essential for HomeKit stability.

Your iPhone is now ready to provision your HomePods correctly.

# Step 3: Factory Reset and Re-Add Your HomePods

1. Factory reset any HomePods that are giving you trouble.
2. With your iPhone *still connected to the 2.4GHz network* (with PWA off), hold it near each HomePod to begin setup.
3. The setup process will transfer the `MyHome_2.4GHz` credentials and the ""PWA: Off"" setting to the HomePod.
4. **CRITICAL:** During setup, your iPhone *may still suggest connecting to the 5GHz network*. **Decline this.** Explicitly confirm you want to use the 2.4GHz network your iPhone is currently on.

# Step 4: Manage Your Phone's Connection (Post-Setup)

Once all your HomePods are set up and stable on the 2.4GHz network, you can decide what's best for your iPhone:

* **For Best Battery Life & Coverage:** You may find your phone works best if you just leave it on the 2.4GHz network as well. As you've noted, forcing a phone to hold a weak 5GHz signal at the edge of its range is a major battery drain.

Oh dear! While we were busy on our isekai mission and dealing with Synergies, it looks like there was a big, bad boss working behind the scenes.

The Zomboss, piloting a giant mech and a master of zombie creation, heard about our plans and intends to retaliate by heading off to spread zombism in new worlds of his own.  
Once you've successfully cleared your original world, you will gain the ability to also freely come and go from the world he has been attacking. Which world will that be?

If the world he choses does not have undead, he will create one outbreak after another to gradually overrun that world. If the world he visits does have the undead, all the undead in that world will become 10 times stronger and get united under his control. The more intelligent undead might resist for a time, but it seems he figured out a way to power himself up to always be on par with the planet's strongest undead.  
He's also a robotics expert that will quickly gain a mastery of any technology he finds in that world.

We won't send you after a dangerous guy like that without even more help, of course. Take **8** of the following perks. You can take **3** more once you can take the fight to Zomboss in the new world.

1. **There's a Zombie On Your Lawn**: You can create a 21x21 square meter grid centered on yourself. On this grid, you can automatically detect any hostile you specify, defaulting to undead. Furthermore, you can use plant powers as if you were standing in any one of the squares around you.
2. **We don't want Zombies on the lawn**: Five times a day, any hostile that manages to reach or attack you past all your defenses will instantly (re)die. The attacks must strike at different parts of your body with each successive hit before the refresh, however.
3. **Tall Dark and Dead**: You become as attractive as you can be without crossing into uncanny valley territory. This can be based on the standards of the world you go to or your own preferences. You can also disable and reenable this appearance change at will.
4. **Bite all the Petals Off My Head**: If you have a plant power-made item within 5 meters of you, enemies cannot target you until they destroy those fixtures. Vegetables and mushrooms are also guaranteed to taste delicious.
5. **The one who planted me here**: You can turn any of your plant powers into a person the same race as you. They will be mindlessly loyal to you, can store plant power uses, and can use those powers along with their bonus on your command.
   * If you have ***Tall, Dark, and Dead***, they will be attractive and perfectly your type. If you have ***You like the taste of brains***, you can grant them independent thought.
6. **See me power an entire infantry**: You can now turn your sun energy into homunculus soldiers that obey you absolutely. By default, one portion makes a soldier on par with a standard soldier of the world you're in, but the more sun power you invest, the stronger they become.
7. **You like the taste of brains**: You can conjure actual or jelly brains that act as irresistible bait for all undead without exception. They are also edible, but their taste is up to personal preference. If you eat the brains of animals, your intelligence will increase.
8. **We don't like zombies**: You can instill an intense aversion to the undead in anyone you touch. This is severe enough that enemies will immediately cooperate with you just to defeat an undead. Does not work on other undead.
9. **I used to play football**: You can initiate an invincible forward charge for up to 100 meters. You'll be exhausted by the end, but will effortlessly smash through everything in your path until you stop.
10. **Road cones protect my head**: All armor you wear, make, or put on others will take damage on behalf of the wearer until it's broken, even if the protection isn't anywhere near where you received the injury.
11. **I have a Screen Door Shield**: You can instantly conjure a high quality shield of any make, reinforce any door to be as durable as a vault, and open a screen in any barrier within reach in your way so that air particles pass through.
12. **We are the undead!**: You can imbue yourself and anyone you touch with a ""false undead"" status for a day. With this effect, most undead will no longer recognize you as a living being and won't attack you even if you attack them. Only higher forms willing to intentionally and directly attack other undead can identify you. For the purpose of plant abilities, undead deceived by this status will still be considered hostile.
13. **Time to Reevaluate**: You can randomly reroll the value or condition of any object. Using it on trash might restore it to its original condition with a random amount of damage, and using it on a pristine object might instantly ruin it.
14. **A lot of food on your plate**: You can automatically fill dishware, kitchen shelves, or pantries with food. You cannot control the contents, but it will generally be what's natural for the location and locale.
15. **Rich in cholesterol**: You can convert fat and calories you consume into valuables at a 100 calorie = \[lowest denomination of money\] basis. You can also instantly absorb food to immediately obtain their nutritional benefits at will. Ingesting materials toxic to your body will not grant you benefits, but you can instantly flush it out of your system with the absorption power.
16. **You're dead but it doesn't matter**: You gain all the immunities and resistances of an undead like zombification, poisoning, charming, and so on. You do not have typical undead vulnerabilities, but will know how to fake it if need be.
17. **Instead we'll use this solar power**: You can choose one of the daytime plant abilities to gain an Overdrive (to be added in the comments). Furthermore, your nighttime plants will no longer be unusable under daylight and the Coffee Bean will instead halve their cooldown with every use. You can take this perk multiple times.
18. **A Lawn Defense at any hour**: You can now queue your uses of plant abilities to automatically be used once the cooldown is over. Furthermore, you are mentally alerted when a major attack is incoming within 24 hours can now see a progress bar representing the onslaught.
19. **I like your tricycle**: You can instantly warp into any moving vehicle you can see. You can warp the current driver out and take their place or simply join them as a passenger if there's room. You also gain intuitive knowledge on how to operate the machine.
20. **There's Butter on my head**: If you throw food at someone's head, they'll be stunned into unmoving silence for 5 seconds. The food must be at least the size of your palm and every type of ingredient only works once for every person.
21. **(Dolphin Chirping)**: You gain the ability to swim at 18 mph, leap over 5 meters from land or water, and gain the ability to echolocate. You also gain a strong libido and associated ""technique"".",2,1761942116.0,6Perks,2,1.0,False
1ol57ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ol57ge/i_feel_guilty_and_sad_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,I feel guilty and sad and don’t know what to do,"I just ended things with my partner. We weren’t together for very long but they had mental health issues that were very extreme and hard to deal with. On top of that i feel they were narcissistic or had narcissistic tendencies. I had been feeling sad in the relationship for what felt like so long. When it first began we fell hard and fast for each other. I had the thoughts of, “is this too good to be true?” And now it feels that way for sure. I had gone away for a week recently and we had a huge fight during it, and on my trip my family could tell i was extremely unhappy. But we made up and i came back and then not even a week later we had another huge fight. Both times i felt like i had to bite my tongue and hold back what i was feeling to make room for my partner and therefore both times it ended with me being the one “in trouble”, the one who had done something wrong because it felt like anytime i tried to defend myself or share my point of view, they would get defensive and just not hear what i was trying to say. It was like they took everything as an attack. There were many issues i had where it felt like i was being manipulated or gaslit. Or like i had to make my feelings small. They were very sensitive about the concept of people feeling like they had to walk on eggshells around them and i didn’t want to make them feel that way around me, but in the end i did. And i feel bad because i think their mental illness was a huge reason why people felt that way about them. They had huge reactions to small things and when it was something big the reaction was always very intense. They would do reckless things and make me worry about them. But nonetheless i tried my hardest to make it work. I know i should have done a better job of communicating but i didn’t. It felt like me trying to communicate was useless sometimes. We tried and tried to make it work, to spend quality time together, go out on dates, etc. They’ve been dealing with a lot of unfortunate life events and have basically been living with me for those reasons, so despite spending lots of time together it didn’t always feel like quality time. I was feeling very upset the other night and finally communicated just a few things that were bothering me. I mentioned how it felt like they didn’t even like me but just tolerated me. They said they were sorry for those things and that they did like me and love me. We were fine enough after that conversation and went to bed. In the morning they left for work and we planned to get coffee after they were back. But i sat down with my mom who asked how things had been going. At this point both of my parents had seen how upset i was on my trip and had their own doubts i assume. And to not tarnish my partners image in front of them (because i live at home and they basically lived with me) I’ve just been not talking about the relationship lately, but it’s been hard feeling like i had no one to talk to about it. So when my mom asked me how it’s been i kind of broke down and told her how I’ve been feeling. She admitted that lately she had been feeling like they weren’t the person for me for various reasons. I don’t want to talk bad about them because i don’t know how much of what I’m feeling is truly how they felt and how much is just how i felt but nonetheless, i talked to my mom and told her i was feeling like breaking up with them and she agreed with my decision. I told her i didn’t know when i should do it and she said now; the sooner the better. And so they came back from work and instead of going for coffee i broke up with them. And i feel bad, like i really didn’t even give them a chance to try and make things better. But at this point i just don’t know how anything could come back from that. My whole family wants to protect me and doesn’t feel good things toward them and i keep going back and forth in my mind on whether i want to give them a chance or not. Because i want to, but i don’t know if that’s me being weak. Plus, i don’t feel like my family would forgive them, and i also don’t know if i would even feel what i once felt knowing everything that’s happened since then. If i wanted to give them a chance, i would feel like i had to see them in a sneaky way where i don’t feel like i can talk to my family about it, or my friends. Because when i broke up with them i told my mom (who inevitably told the rest of my family) and i told my friends. Not in some petty way, but in a way that i was looking for support. They called me after, seemingly looking for answers and asked why and yet when i started saying why they hung up on me. They called again later again and just wanted to tell me how much they hated me for what i did. Then they called again later asking for another chance, which is when i told them all the things i felt like i was bottling up. It wasn’t a good feeling at all to tell them those things because i wasn’t trying to be mean. But yet they said they were on the right path and wanted to change and all they wanted was to fight for me and try to get me back but i stood my ground because like i said, even though i felt the urge to let them try and give them a second chance i just thought of how sneaky it would feel after telling everyone, and i felt a sense of shame from that. But now it’s the next day and all i can feel is still sadness and guilt and i keep wanting to say something to them. I keep hoping that instead of just saying they’ll fight for me they actually will. Like they will show up with a truck full of flowers and beg for hours for forgiveness from not only me but my family. And i feel stupid for feeling that way. I sat outside for hours hoping maybe they’d come by and they didn’t. And i know I’m the one who ended it so why would they. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know what i would do if they did show up. I need some advice please. ",1,1761942099.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

You are not alone. 

I used to believe success in this space meant:

* Constant hustle
* Cold messaging strangers
* Showing up loud and live every day with perfect hair and a ring light

But as a mom? That’s not real life.  
Most days, my ""office"" was the kitchen counter or the front seat of my car.  
And guess what? I still built a business, not by being everywhere, but by being intentional.

What actually worked for me:

✔ Showing up consistently in small pockets of time  
✔ Creating content that served, not sold  
✔ Building relationships with other real humans, not just “prospects”  
✔ Letting my real-life mom life be part of my story, not something to hide

Moms are master multitaskers, expert problem solvers, and already know how to influence little humans every day.  
Those same skills transfer beautifully to network marketing.

The shift happened when I stopped chasing what other people were doing and started building a system that fit my life.

Now:

* I work in small, focused bursts (sometimes in leggings with a toddler on my lap)
* I attract people who relate to my journey, not expect me to be perfect
* I feel proud of the business I’m building and still present for the people who matter most

If you’re a mom building your business during nap time or while reheating your coffee for the 3rd time today...

Just know this:  
 👉 You are not behind  
 👉 You are not doing it wrong  
 👉 You don’t have to choose between family and success, you just need a strategy that works with your life, not against it

Glad you found your way here. This sub’s for people who are kinda over the whole swipe-right-swipe-left scene and just want to meet real people. No algorithms, no weird bios with “gym • travel • coffee” just humans being normal (hopefully).
We’re not trying to be Tinder 2.0.
We’re trying to be that rare corner of the internet where people write with effort, humour, and heart whether you’re looking for love, friendship, or something in between.
Think of it like a chill corner of the internet where people actually reply, write with effort, and don’t start DMs with “hii dear.”

🪩 How to Get Started
	•	Make a post!
Put your [M/F/NB], age, and city in the title then just write about yourself.
Who you are, what you like, what you’re looking for simple.
Add some personality; we love that.
Example:
[M25 | Gurgaon] CA student & Big 4 escape artist looking for someone who gets my love for good food and better playlists.
	•	Be nice.
Everyone’s putting themselves out there don’t be weird, don’t be creepy, don’t be a robot.
	•	Keep it real.
Talk about stuff you actually care about music, books, life, chaos, whatever. It’s more interesting than pretending to be perfect.
🧊 A Few Rules
	•	18+ only.
	•	No NSFW content or creepy DMs.
	•	No spam, no catfishing.
	•	Effort > emojis.
☕ TL;DR

This sub’s about actual connection not chasing likes or collecting matches.
Post, comment, talk, vibe.
Worst case? You meet cool people.
Best case? You stop hating dating apps.

Welcome in.

The Cavaliers should win this game by at least 10, friends. Toronto’s defense has been abysmal having lost their last 4 straight games (3 of which were losses by at least 10 points). Not only has Cleveland won their last 5 straight meetings with the Raptors, but I imagine the home squad will also be eager to bag a healthy win after getting stomped by Boston on the road. So long as Donovan Mitchell is good to go, my money’s on the Cavaliers to cover the spread here.

-Chapter one:deadline

Sarah Chen printed the report at 11:47 PM, three hours before the Monday morning briefing. Twenty-three pages. Her first comprehensiv analysis for Founders Fund, and she'd used every tool at her disposal.

She read it once more in the empty office, coffee going cold. Section 4.2 made her pause, really take a second. 

*""Heliogen expected to announce breakthrough in concentrator efficiency Q3, pivoting toward industrial heat applications. Likely partnership talks with ArcelorMittal for steel decarbonization pilot.""*

She stared at the paragraph. Where had she gotten this? She opened her research folder. The Heliogen materials mentioned solar concentration, sure. But ArcelorMittal? She searched her notes. Nothing. She searched her browser history. Nothing.

She checked the company's public filings, press releases, recent interviews. No mention of steel. No mention of ArcelorMittal.

.. What the fck
Sarah's hands went cold. She looked at the time: 11:53 PM. She could rewrite section 4.2. Pull the claim. Replace it with something vaguer, safer.

But the briefing copies were already in the conference room. Peter Thiel would be reading one in nine hours.

She closed her laptop and went home.



Peter read Sarah's report on the flight back from Miami. Comprehensive. Sharp pattern recognition. Weak on second-order effects but strong fundamentals for an intern.

Then section 4.2.

He read it twice. Pulled out his phone mid-flight and texted his Heliogen contact: *Any steel partnerships in the works?*

The response came before landing: *How did you know? We're announcing ArcelorMittal pilot in six weeks. Hasn't leaked anywhere.*

Peter sat very still in first class, report open on his lap.

The plane touched down. He sent another text: *Need Sarah Chen in my office first thing.*

---

Sarah sat across from Peter Thiel at 8:00 AM. His office was smaller than she'd imagined. No grand view. Just books, a standing desk, and venetian blinds cutting the morning light into slats.

""Section 4.2,"" Peter said.

""I know,"" Sarah said quietly.

""Heliogen confirmed it this morning. The ArcelorMittal partnership. Announcement in six weeks."" Peter's voice was flat, matter-of-fact. ""Their head of communications wants to know who leaked.""

Sarah felt her throat tighten.

""Who told you?""

""Nobody.""

""Sarah."" Not angry. Just precise. ""Someone inside Heliogen is talking. I need to know who.""

""I used Claude,"" Sarah said.

Peter stopped.

""I was behind on the research. Eight companies, three days. I asked it to generate likely strategic moves based on their tech position."" The words tumbled out. ""I was going to verify everything but I ran out of time and I thought it was just a starting framework and I didn't think—""

""You didn't verify it.""

""No.""

""And it was right.""

Sarah nodded miserably. ""I'm sorry. I'll resign. I know I violated—""

""Which model?""

""What?""

""Opus? Sonnet? Which version?""

""Sonnet 4.5.""

Peter was quiet. Then: ""Did you tell anyone else you used it?""

""No.""

""Don't."" He turned back to his window. ""You're not fired. But next time you get information from a non-traditional source—especially if you can't verify it—I need to know. Clear?""

""Yes.""

""That's all.""

Chapter 2: 
Either luck of a god... Or.. .. Can algorithms count cards? 

Sarah left. Peter stood at his window for a long time.

The Heliogen contact's text was still on his screen: *How did you know? Hasn't leaked anywhere.*

Peter had built Palantir on pattern recognition. He understood prediction models better than almost anyone. He knew what hallucinations were—probabilistic errors, random walks through latent space that happened to generate plausible-sounding nonsense.

Except this wasn't nonsense.

The model had generated the most probable continuation. That's all it ever did. Every single token, every response—just probability. When it matched known reality, you called it accurate. When it didn't, you called it a hallucination.

But the underlying process was identical.

*Oh.*

Peter sat down slowly.

*Oh my god.*

The model didn't have access to Heliogen's internal communications. It couldn't have leaked information because the information wasn't in its training data. 

But it had patterns. Billions of parameters trained on how companies move, how industries evolve, how technology progresses. Not facts—*probability distributions*.

When Sarah asked it about Heliogen, it didn't retrieve an answer. It generated the most likely next state.

And the most likely next state... was correct.

Not because it knew. Because the pattern space it navigated was the same pattern space that Heliogen's executives were navigating. The same probability landscape. The model and the humans were both following gradients toward the same local maximum.

The model just got there first.

Peter pulled out his phone. Started typing to Demis Hassabis, then stopped. Typed to Dario Amodei. Stopped again.

This wasn't a conversation for Signal.

He opened a new terminal window instead. Started writing a script. Seventeen companies. Forty runs each. No verification, no constraints, no safety rails. Just pure probability generation.

Let it hallucinate. See what becomes real.

If he was right—if these weren't errors but probability coordinates in state space that consensus reality simply hadn't reached yet—then the implications were staggering.

Not prediction markets. Not forecasting.

*Oracle space.*

He ran the first batch. Saved the outputs. Started the second.

The question wasn't whether the hallucinations were wrong.

The question was whether reality was just slow.


CHAPTER 3:
An ugly avoided  painting is praised, when it was re-framed. 

Peter's portfolio company went public in 2029. ClearPath Analytics. ""Probability-based risk assessment for enterprise decision-making."" That's what the prospectus said.

By 2032, seventeen states had licensing agreements.

Marcus Webb's lawyer explained it carefully. ""Your risk score isn't a prediction. It's a probability signature. The system identifies patterns that correlate with certain outcomes.""

""What outcomes?"" Marcus asked.

""That's proprietary. But your signature matches profiles of concern.""

""I haven't done anything.""

""The system doesn't evaluate actions. It evaluates probability space."" The lawyer spoke like he'd said this many times. ""Think of it like insurance. They don't know if you'll have an accident. They know if you fit the pattern of people who do.""

Marcus stared at the paperwork. ""So what happens now?""

""Mandatory counseling. Quarterly check-ins. If your signature improves, restrictions lift. Most people adapt within eighteen months.""

""And if I don't?""

The lawyer didn't answer that.

In the coffee shop near the courthouse, two graduate students were arguing about their machine learning assignment.

""But it's literally just making shit up,"" the first one said. ""I asked it about quantum decoherence timescales in room-temperature superconductors and it gave me this whole detailed explanation with citations. I looked up the citations—none of them exist.""

""That's not making shit up,"" her friend said. ""It's generating the most probable continuation based on its training. Every output is a hallucination. That's how the model works. It doesn't have truth. It has probability.""

""Okay, but when the probable answer is *wrong*—""

""Is it wrong? Or did you just check too early?""

The first student laughed. ""That's not how physics works.""

""Isn't it?"" Her friend stirred her coffee. ""Information propagates. Maybe the model sees patterns we haven't published yet. Maybe we call it a hallucination because we're measuring against what we currently know instead of what's actually probable.""

""That's insane.""

""Yeah."" She smiled. ""Probably.""

The courthouse was quiet now. Marcus signed the forms. Acknowledged the restrictions. Accepted the monitoring.

A small logo in the corner of every page: ClearPath Analytics.

Below it, smaller still: *A Founders Fund Company*

He'd asked his lawyer where the system came from. Who built it. The lawyer said it was based on classified research. Pattern recognition developed for national security applications. Declassified for public safety use.

No one mentioned the intern report. The Heliogen prediction. The forty runs Peter had saved.

No one needed to.

The system worked. Ninety-four point seven percent correlation. 

Whether it was predicting the future or creating it—that was the kind of question only philosophers asked anymore. And philosophers, Marcus learned, didn't get licensing agreements.

Sarah Chen watched the Marcus Webb verdict on her tablet from her apartment in Auckland. She'd left Silicon Valley five years ago. No one knew why. She'd been successful. Rising star at Founders Fund. Then just... gone.

She thought about patterns. About the difference between prediction and creation. About whether the oracle shows you the future or teaches you how to build it.

She thought about Section 4.2.

About the question she'd never asked: *What if it wasn't predicting what Heliogen would do?*

*What if it was predicting what Peter would make them do?*

She closed the tablet.

Outside, Auckland rain fell in patterns. Fractals branching. Every drop following probability down the window.

Some paths more likely than others.
