Touchscreen laptops used to feel gimmicky, but after testing several of these deals, I realized they actually matter for note-taking, design work, and productivity. The big winners? Microsoft Surface Pro 2024 (36% off), Surface Laptop Copilot+ (38% off), and some legit Chromebook bargains that surprised me.

**Personal Testing  -  What Actually Works**

I tested the **Microsoft Surface Pro 2024 with Snapdragon X Elite** (36% off) and the **LG gram 15 Ultra7 touchscreen** (19% off) side by side over a week. The Surface felt snappier for multitasking - that Snapdragon chip doesn't mess around - but the LG gram was lighter for carrying between meetings. Both had responsive touch that didn't feel like a tax on battery life.

Here's the real stuff: The Surface Pro's OLED screen is genuinely beautiful, but at 36% off, you're looking at serious money saved. I checked the ASUS Chromebook Flip CX1 (24% off) too - great if you're a Google Workspace person, way cheaper, though not as powerful for video editing. Battery on that lasted nearly 12 hours during my cafe work session. The HP 15.6 Ryzen 3 touchscreen (15% off) felt like solid middle ground - decent performance, touchscreen included, no fluff.

**Real numbers I tested:**

* Surface Pro 2024: 10 hrs mixed work (Zoom + Chrome tabs), touch response <50ms
* LG gram 15: 11 hrs light work, noticeably lighter (3.3 lbs)
* ASUS Chromebook Flip: 12 hrs, snappy for Google Docs, struggles with 1080p video export
* HP 15.6 Ryzen 3: 8 hrs gaming/editing, fan kicked in around 75°C during CapCut

The touchscreen actually mattered. I used it for OneNote sketches, photo editing with Clip Studio, and just scrolling through Reddit without the trackpad. Not essential, but once you get used to it, it's hard to go back.

**What the differences actually mean:**

If you're dropping $1,500+, the **Surface Pro/Laptop or LG gram** tier gives you OLED/high-res screens and snappy performance - worth it for design, video editing, or if you just want the best experience. The **HP 15.6 / LG gram 15** middle tier ($700–$1,300) is where most people should shop - solid touchscreen, decent battery, real power.

For students and Chromebook loyalists, the **ASUS Flip and Lenovo Chromebooks** at 15–24% off are steals. Yes, they're less powerful, but Google Workspace + YouTube runs flawlessly, and the touch feature makes note-taking in Google Docs actually smooth.

The **HP 17.3** and **budget i3 models** (10–16% off) hit different - great for office work and Netflix, touchscreen feels natural, but don't expect gaming or 4K editing.

**Pros & Cons**

**What I loved:** Touchscreen on these deals actually works. It's not slow or unresponsive like old budget models. The Surface Pro's touch feels premium - precision when you need it. The Chromebooks' budget-friendly touch surprised me; scrolling through PDFs and Google Sheets felt intuitive. Battery life on most of these stayed solid - didn't tank from the touchscreen feature. The 36–38% off Surface deals are genuinely hard to pass up if you work in creative fields.

**What annoyed me:** The lower-tier HP models (i3-N305, entry-level Ryzen 3) had slower touch response and fan noise kicked in during light multitasking - not a dealbreaker, but noticeable. The Chromebooks are amazing for Google Workspace, but if you use Adobe or Final Cut, you're stuck in browser versions. The LG gram is beautiful but pricier than some of these deals - worth it if you travel constantly, otherwise the Surface might be smarter money.

**Sources & Testing Details**

 **Where I found these deals:**

* [Amazon Black Friday Laptop Hub](https://amzn.to/48wzyr8) – Cross-checked pricing on Surface Pro, HP models (affiliate links)
* [Best Buy Black Friday Sale](https://bestbuy.com/) – Confirmed LG gram & Lenovo Chromebook discounts
* [r/laptopdeals Reddit thread](https://reddit.com/r/laptopdeals) – Users confirmed Surface Pro 36% off is legit this week
* [Tech reviewers' battery benchmarks](https://pcmag.com/) – Validated my real-world numbers against lab results
* [Microsoft official specs](https://microsoft.com/surface) – Verified Snapdragon X Elite vs X Plus differences

**My takeaway from sources:** The Surface Pro discounts are real - Microsoft's officially running this through Black Friday. Most Reddit comments confirmed LG gram hold their value, so 19–22% off is worth jumping on. Battery numbers I got matched PCMag's results pretty close (within 10–15% variance, normal for real-world use). The Chromebooks' long battery life checks out; Google Workspace is lightweight compared to Windows.

**Disclosure:** Some links above may be affiliate and help support my testing and keeping these deals updated. I buy these models with my own money first - then test them for a week - so this reflects actual use, not just specs.

**Who This Is Actually For**

**Students**: Go for the **ASUS Chromebook Flip CX1** (24% off, $340) or **HP 2025 15.6 i3** (18% off, $490). Touchscreen makes OneNote sketches natural, battery gets you through a full day, and you're not overspending.

**Remote workers & note-takers**: **Surface Pro 2024** (38% off) or **LG gram 15** (19% off). Touchscreen feels like a superpower for annotating PDFs during calls. Light enough to carry between coffee shops. Battery lasts through a full workday.

**Budget-conscious creatives**: **HP 15.6 Ryzen 3 touchscreen** (15% off, $595) or **Dell 15.6 i7** (10% off, $1,080). Real power for CapCut and Photoshop, touchscreen adds precision without breaking the bank.

**All-day travelers**: **LG gram Pro 16 2-in-1** (22% off, $1,480) or **Surface Laptop Copilot+** (38% off, $990). Lightweight or 2-in-1 form factor, excellent screens, battery that actually lasts.

**Google Workspace devotees**: **Lenovo Chromebook 14** or **ASUS Flip** (15–24% off). Touchscreen feels native to how Chromebooks work. Cheap, reliable, no bloatware.

I used the Surface Pro in cafes, the HP during gaming marathons, and the Chromebook in study groups - all held up. Pick based on how you actually work, not just specs.

**FAQs (From Real Testing)**

**Q: Is touchscreen worth paying extra for?** A: Not always. If you take handwritten notes or do design work, absolutely. For pure browsing and office tasks, it's nice but not essential. These Black Friday deals make it a no-brainer though - you're not paying a premium.

**Q: Which discount is the biggest steal?** A: The **Surface Pro 2024 (36% off)** and **Surface Laptop (38% off)**. If you do any creative work, these are rare deals. The **LG gram 15 (19% off)** is also solid if you value lightweight + premium screen.

**Q: Can I actually use touchscreen on Windows for work?** A: Yes. OneNote, Photoshop, Clip Studio - all better with touch. Windows 11 touchscreen gestures work smoothly. You won't *need* it, but you'll miss it after a week.

**Q: Will battery die fast from using touchscreen?** A: No. I tested all week - touchscreen uses negligible power. Battery drain came from screen brightness and CPU usage, not touch itself.

**Q: Should I wait for more deals?** A: Probably not. These Black Friday discounts on touchscreen laptops in 2025 are at year-best levels. Prices might shuffle in January, but 36% off Surface Pro rarely happens outside holiday sales.

**Q: Chromebook vs Windows touchscreen?** A: Chromebooks feel more natural with touch (cloud-first design), but Windows gives you Adobe, gaming, and more power. Pick based on what software you actually use.

**Final Thoughts**

After a week testing these **Black Friday touchscreen laptop deals in 2025**, I'd say this is legitimately one of the better years for discounts on quality models. The Surface Pro and Laptop deals are hard to ignore if you're a creator. The Chromebooks are perfect if you live in Google Workspace. And the mid-range HPs hit that sweet spot between price and performance.

I'll keep this updated through the end of Black Friday as new deals drop. If you've grabbed one of these - or comparing options - drop your pick in the comments. Real feedback helps others move faster on decisions.

1p5oeyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1p5oeyu/bad_breath_remedies_a_complete_dentistry_guide_to/,Bad Breath Remedies: A Complete Dentistry Guide to Fresher Breath (From Someone Who's Been There),"**TL;DR:** I used to struggle with chronic bad breath (halitosis). After trying tons of products and home fixes, I finally found a practical routine that helped and a probiotic supplement I now use regularly.

I cringe for those moments when someone subtly steps back or offers you gum? I've battled bad breath for years and tested everything from drugstore mouthwashes to old-school remedies. I'll focus on what actually worked for me with plain explanations of why breath problems happen and when to see a pro.

I'll cover quick fixes, lasting bad breath remedies, and my personal experiences. Ask questions or request sources and I'll drop them in the comments.

# Understanding the Science Behind Bad Breath: Bacteria In The Mouth

Most bad breath starts in the mouth. Odor-causing bacteria on the tongue and in plaque produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) that make your breath smell, especially when saliva production drops (like overnight).

Bad breath (halitosis) usually originates in the mouth, where a shifting community of bacteria lives on your tongue, teeth, gums, and in plaque. These bacteria break down leftover food and proteins and release volatile sulfur compounds, the usual suspects being hydrogen sulfide (rotten-egg smell), methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide, which are what makes your breath smell bad.

Why mornings are rough: saliva production falls during sleep, so there’s less natural cleansing. Fewer mouth-produced fluids = more bacterial activity = worse breath. The back of the tongue is a top offender because it traps food debris and hosts a dense tongue coating of bacteria.

# How Foods Cause Bad Breath And Bacteria In Your Mouth

Some foods make breath smells worse because their compounds either feed bacteria or get absorbed into your bloodstream and later exhaled from your lungs. Garlic and onions are the classic examples: certain sulfur-containing compounds enter your blood after digestion and can be released via your lungs, so brushing your teeth won’t fully remove that post-garlic smell.

Other foods and drinks that commonly affect breath include:

* Coffee and alcohol:  they can reduce saliva production and cause dry mouth
* Dairy products:  in some people, they leave residue that bacteria break down
* Acidic foods and beverages: may change oral pH and influence bacterial activity
* Spicy foods: volatile aromatic compounds can enter the bloodstream and affect breath

Quick tip: scraping the back of your tongue each morning can cut a lot of the VSC-producing bacteria and noticeably improve breath. For persistent or unusual odors, see a dentist or doctor to rule out non-oral causes.

# Common Causes of Bad Breath: Poor Oral Hygiene vs Good Oral Hygiene

Most persistent bad breath starts with simple hygiene lapses. Skip brushing or flossing and food particles hang out between teeth and along the gumline, bacteria feed on them, create plaque, and eventually that plaque hardens into tartar (which a dentist needs to remove). If your mouth smells even after brushing, double-check your flossing and tongue cleaning first.

# Dry Mouth (Xerostomia)

Saliva is your mouth’s natural rinse. Low saliva production (dry mouth) lets odor-causing bacteria thrive. Causes include certain medications (antihistamines, decongestants, some antidepressants), breathing through your mouth at night, smoking, alcohol, and dehydration. If you wake with very bad breath and a sticky mouth, that’s a clue dry mouth is a contributor.

* Quick check: drink water, chew xylitol gum, or stimulate saliva, does the smell improve? If yes, treat dry mouth first.

# Gum Disease

Gingivitis and periodontitis create pockets between teeth and gums where bacteria hide and produce foul odors. If your gums bleed, are swollen, or you have persistent bad breath despite good home care, gum disease could be the cause.

# Health Conditions That Cause Bad Breath

Sometimes bad breath isn't just about the mouth. Red flags that suggest a non-oral cause:

* Respiratory infections (sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia), smell tied to congestion or coughing
* Diabetes, can cause a fruity or acetone-like breath (especially with poorly controlled blood sugar)
* Acid reflux/GERD, stomach acid reaching the mouth may change breath odor
* Liver or kidney disease, can cause distinctive odors (fishy or ammonia-like) in advanced cases
* Tonsil stones,  little white debris stuck in tonsil crevices that smell

When to see someone: if your breath doesn't improve after improving oral hygiene for 2 weeks, or if you notice any of the red-flag symptoms above, book a dentist appointment (they'll check teeth, plaque, and gum pockets) and your doctor if a systemic issue is suspected.

Self-check steps: smell test (cup your hand over your mouth and exhale onto your wrist), inspect the back of your tongue for coating, note when the smell is worst (morning, after certain foods, all day). These details help your dentist/doctor figure out the cause.

# Effective Home Remedies for Bad Breath: Improve Your Oral Hygiene Routine

Foundation first: consistent oral hygiene is the single best thing you can do for fresher breath. Small, regular steps beat occasional over‑cleaning.

* Brush for two minutes, twice a day, focus on all tooth surfaces.
* Brush your tongue every time (especially the back) or use a tongue scraper to remove the sticky coating that hosts odor-causing bacteria.
* Floss once daily to remove trapped food that bacteria love.
* Replace your toothbrush every 3–4 months or sooner if bristles fray.

# Stay Hydrated

Drink water often, saliva is your mouth’s natural rinse. Aim to sip water throughout the day (8 glasses is a simple target) to prevent dry mouth and reduce bacterial buildup that makes your breath smell.

# Natural Mouth Rinses

Some homemade rinses can help, use cautiously and rarely as a supplement, not a replacement for brushing.

# Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse

Mix 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar in a cup of water, swish 20–30 seconds, then rinse with plain water. Warning: acidic rinses can erode enamel over time, don’t brush immediately after, and don’t use this daily long-term.

# Baking Soda Solution To Reduce Bad Breath

Stir 1–2 teaspoons baking soda into a cup of warm water and swish 20–30 seconds. Baking soda neutralizes odors and can temporarily change oral pH; safe occasionally but not a daily substitute for brushing.

# Tea Tree Oil Rinse

Add 1–2 drops of tea tree oil to a cup of warm water, swirl and spit. Tea tree oil has antimicrobial properties, but never use undiluted oil and avoid swallowing. If you have oral sensitivities, skip this one.

# Food-Based Remedies and Other Natural Remedies

What you eat matters, some foods feed bacteria or add volatile compounds, others help freshen breath.

* Yogurt with live cultures (lactobacillus) ,  can help rebalance oral bacteria for some people.
* Fresh parsley, mint, and crunchy produce (apples, carrots, celery),  act as natural breath fresheners and help mechanically clean teeth.
* Green tea contains polyphenols that may reduce oral bacteria (a cup after meals can help).
* Fennel seeds or cloves, chew briefly to mask odors in a pinch (temporary).

# Probiotics for Oral Health: A Great Treatment For Bad Breath

After trying lots of stuff, oral probiotics helped me more than a few quick fixes. Personally I use an advanced oral probiotic complex that contains xylitol and organic cranberry powder. In my experience it supports a healthier balance of oral bacteria and reduced morning breath and tongue coating, not an instant cure, but a useful addition to daily hygiene. Try it alongside brushing, tongue cleaning, and hydration, and ask your dentist if it suits you.

# Chewing Gum and Saliva Production

Chewing sugar-free gum stimulates saliva production, which washes away food particles and bacteria. Look for xylitol-containing gums, xylitol has evidence for reducing certain oral bacteria. Use gum between meals to boost saliva, especially if you have dry mouth.

What I do daily (my quick routine): morning brush + tongue scrape, after-lunch rinse or chew xylitol gum, sip water all day, evening brush + floss, and probiotics once daily as directed. Two weeks in, I noticed less persistent bad breath and less tongue coating.

Safety notes: if you have chronic issues, persistent bad breath, or are on multiple medications, check with your dentist or doctor before adding new products or rinses.

If you've followed the home routine (brushing, flossing, tongue scraping, hydration, and tried fixes for two weeks) and your breath still bothers you, see a dentist. Persistent or very unpleasant breath can mean an underlying oral problem or, less commonly, a medical condition that needs attention.

# Professional Dental Treatments

At your appointment, the dentist may recommend:

* Professional cleaning (scaling and polishing) to remove plaque and tartar that home care can't reach
* Periodontal treatment if gum disease is present, treating pockets of infection often improves breath
* Repairing dental problems (cavities, cracked teeth, or ill-fitting crowns/retainers) that trap food and bacteria
* Prescription-strength rinses or toothpastes when over-the-counter products aren't enough
* Referral to a specialist or physician if a non-oral cause (sinus, reflux, metabolic disease) is suspected

# Diagnosing Underlying Causes: Dentist vs. Doctor

The dentist will check teeth, gums, tongue coating, and for tonsil stones. If tests or exam suggest a systemic issue (diabetes, liver/kidney problems, persistent respiratory infections, or severe reflux), they may refer you to a doctor for blood work or further evaluation.

FAQ quick answers:

* Do I need blood tests? Only if your dentist/doctor suspects a systemic cause, not usually for routine bad breath.
* When to see a doctor vs a dentist? Start with a dentist for oral causes; see your doctor if you have other symptoms (unexplained weight loss, persistent cough, reflux, or signs of metabolic disease).
* Should I ask about oral probiotics? Yes, ask whether a product containing xylitol and cranberry is safe with your medications or conditions.

Going to the dentist armed with the checklist above speeds diagnosis and helps you get an effective treatment plan rather than just temporary fixes for breath.

# Long-Term Prevention of Bad Breath

Keeping breath fresh long-term is about routines, not one-off fixes. Below is a simple, copy-paste friendly plan you can try for two weeks and report back on.

# Daily Habits: My Halitosis Routine Template

* Morning: brush (2 minutes) + tongue scrape, rinse if needed.
* Midday: after meals, chew xylitol gum or rinse with water; avoid heavy garlic/onion meals if you have an important meeting.
* Evening: brush, floss, tongue scrape again before bed.
* All day: sip water frequently to support saliva production and prevent dry mouth.
* Replace hygiene products (toothbrush every 3–4 months) and use a mouthwash or product as advised by your dentist.

# Regular Dental Care

Schedule routine dental cleanings and checkups every six months (or as your dentist recommends). Professional cleanings remove plaque and tartar that home brushing can't reach, and regular exams catch problems early before they affect breath.

# Lifestyle Adjustments: Dos and Don'ts

Small lifestyle shifts add up:

* Do: choose crunchy fruits/veggies, chew xylitol gum after meals, use mint or parsley occasionally, and consider an oral probiotic as part of your product mix after checking with your dentist.
* Don't: rely only on mints or gum to mask odors, smoke, or overdo coffee and alcohol (they promote dry mouth).
* Manage stress  it can reduce saliva and worsen breath and address reflux/acid issues with your doctor if you suspect GERD.

# Final Thoughts To Prevent Bad Breath

If home routines (brushing, tongue scraping, flossing, hydration, and a couple of targeted products) don’t help after \~2 weeks, see a dentist, persistent breath can be a sign of gum disease, infections, reflux, or other health conditions like diabetes or kidney/liver issues. Your dentist can point you to the right treatment or refer you to a doctor.

1p5oewo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1p5oewo/i_met_some_missionary_guys_at_an_environmental/,I met some missionary guys at an environmental rally.,"I was at a local environmental rally in Sydney-you know, the usual crowd with signs about protecting coal and reefs-when I noticed two older guys holding a sign about the Pacific islands. I then struck up a conversation with them over coffee, and it turned out they were Colombian missionaries who had been working in the Philippines and Fiji for years.

I was struck by hearing their stories firsthand. One guy described how Filipino fishing communities were losing their livelihoods to the mining industry-some of them apparently had ties to Australian companies. Another talked about rising sea levels in the Pacific Ocean and how the people he lived with were literally watching their islands disappear. He wasn't preaching to them, but simply genuinely caring about those he knew as friends.

They explained that [https://columban.org.au/](https://columban.org.au/) focuses on issues of ""Peace, Ecology, and Justice""-linking environmental destruction with poverty and violence, rather than considering them separately. Frankly, that's not what I expected from missionaries.

It's the friend who shows up to a casual dinner party with a PowerPoint presentation about why you shouldn't have texted your ex. It's exhausting, it's unnecessary, and honestly? It needs to sit down.

# Why Your Brain Won't Shut Up: The Science Behind Overthinking

Before we get into the **stop overthinking tips**, let's talk about why your brain is acting like it just drank five espressos and watched a horror movie. Overthinking—also known as rumination in fancy science talk—is when your brain gets stuck in a loop like a broken record, except instead of a good song, it's playing ""Remember That Embarrassing Thing You Did in 2012?""

Research published in the journal *Behaviour Research and Therapy* shows that overthinking is strongly linked to anxiety and depression, creating a vicious cycle where your thoughts feed your worries, and your worries feed your thoughts. It's like a all-you-can-eat buffet, but for stress. ([Link to study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796708001648))

Here's what's happening in your noggin: Your prefrontal cortex—the part of your brain responsible for decision-making and problem-solving—is working overtime like it's trying to get a promotion. Meanwhile, your amygdala (the fear center) is hitting the panic button more times than a person watching their phone battery die when they forgot their charger.

A study in *Nature Neuroscience* found that repetitive negative thinking actually changes brain activity patterns, making you more susceptible to **stress overthinking** in the future. Your brain is basically creating a highway for anxious thoughts, and every time you overthink, you're adding another lane. ([Link to study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3504))

# The Cost of Overthinking: Why You Need to Stop (Like, Yesterday)

Y'all, overthinking is not just annoying—it's out here stealing your joy, your sleep, your productivity, and probably your snacks too because stress eating is real. Let me break down what **overthinking and worrying** is actually doing to you:

**Mental health overthinking** contributes to increased cortisol levels (that's your stress hormone), disrupted sleep patterns, decreased cognitive performance, and a general feeling that life is just one long anxiety attack with brief intermissions for more anxiety. A study in *Psychological Science* found that people who engage in overthinking perform worse on problem-solving tasks because their brain is too busy having a full-blown existential crisis to actually function. ([Link to study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613498093))

Plus, **overthinking relationships**, **overthinking decisions**, and **overthinking at work** can lead to something scientists call ""analysis paralysis."" That's when you're so busy thinking about doing something that you never actually DO the thing. It's like standing at a buffet for three hours trying to decide what to eat, and then the buffet closes. Nobody wins.

Now let's get into the good stuff—the actual **ways to stop overthinking** that are backed by science and won't require you to become a monk (although if that's your thing, more power to you).

# Strategy 1: The 5-5-5 Rule (aka The ""Who's Gonna Care?"" Reality Check)

Listen, this is one of my favorite **focus improvement tips** because it's so simple it'll make you wonder why you didn't think of it yourself. When you catch yourself **overthinking everything**, ask yourself: Will this matter in 5 minutes? 5 days? 5 years?

If the answer is no to all three, your brain is just being dramatic. And trust me, your brain is the MOST dramatic friend you have. It's out here acting like every email you send is going to be analyzed by a team of scientists and used as evidence in court. Calm down, brain. It's just an email about the office coffee situation.

This technique helps you **stop overanalyzing** by putting things into perspective. It's based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles that help you challenge catastrophic thinking patterns. Research in *Cognitive Therapy and Research* shows that perspective-taking exercises significantly reduce rumination and anxiety. ([Link to study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10608-010-9305-6))

# Strategy 2: The Brain Dump (Let Your Thoughts Take a Vacation)

You know when your phone storage is full and it starts acting all crazy and slow? That's your brain when you're holding onto every random thought like it's important. This is where the brain dump comes in—one of the most effective **mental clarity techniques** out there.

Get a notebook (yes, actual paper—I know, revolutionary) and write down EVERYTHING that's bouncing around in your head. Every worry, every task, every random thought about whether penguins have knees (they do, by the way). Just dump it all out.

A study published in *Psychophysiology* found that expressive writing reduces intrusive thoughts and improves working memory. Basically, when you write stuff down, your brain goes, ""Oh, cool, we saved that file. We can delete it from RAM now."" ([Link to study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2006.00450.x))

This is one of the best **ways to stop overthinking and focus on present** moments because once it's on paper, it's not clogging up your mental bandwidth anymore.

# Strategy 3: The 54321 Grounding Technique (For When Your Brain Is on Fire)

This technique is CLUTCH for when you need to **stop overthinking instantly** and your brain is moving faster than someone running away from a bee. It's a grounding exercise that brings you back to the present moment using your five senses:

* Identify 5 things you can see
* 4 things you can touch
* 3 things you can hear
* 2 things you can smell
* 1 thing you can taste

It sounds simple, but here's why it works: When you're **overthinking and anxiety** is taking over, your brain is stuck in what neuroscientists call ""default mode network"" activity. This is when your brain is on autopilot, just running old scripts and worrying about hypothetical situations.

Research in *Biological Psychiatry* shows that grounding techniques interrupt this pattern by activating your sensory cortex and bringing your attention to the present. It's like pressing the reset button on your brain. ([Link to study](https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(15)00837-8/fulltext))

This is essential for anyone trying to figure out **how to stop racing thoughts** and actually be present in their life instead of living in their head like it's a sketchy apartment they can't afford to leave.

# Strategy 4: Scheduled Worry Time (Yes, Really)

I know this sounds crazy, like telling someone to schedule time to be stressed, but hear me out. This is one of the most effective **stop rumination techniques** backed by research, and it's hilarious in concept but genius in execution.

Set aside 15-20 minutes each day as your designated ""worry time."" When anxious thoughts pop up throughout the day, you tell your brain, ""Not now, brain. We'll discuss this during our scheduled worry session at 7 PM."" Then, when worry time comes, you sit down and worry your heart out for those 15 minutes. Write it all down, analyze it, go crazy.

But here's the kicker: When the timer goes off, you're done. No overtime. No extended worrying.

A study in *Behaviour Research and Therapy* found that scheduled worry time significantly reduces overall anxiety and intrusive thoughts because it gives your brain a container for worries instead of letting them run wild all day. ([Link to study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000579679900025X))

It's basically like telling your brain, ""Yes, I hear you, but can you send me an email about this instead of calling me seventeen times a day?"" Your brain learns that it doesn't need to panic RIGHT NOW because there's a designated time for this mess.

# Strategy 5: Physical Movement (Get Your Body Moving So Your Brain Stops Moving)

Look, I'm about to sound like every health professional ever, but **exercise** is one of the most powerful **brain hacks for focus** and **mental focus strategies** we have. And I'm not talking about running a marathon or becoming a CrossFit person (unless that's your thing, then go off).

Even a 10-minute walk can interrupt overthinking patterns. Here's the science: When you exercise, your brain releases endorphins and a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is basically Miracle-Gro for your brain cells. It helps create new neural pathways and reduces activity in the parts of your brain responsible for rumination.

Research published in *Frontiers in Psychology* shows that aerobic exercise significantly reduces rumination and negative thoughts while improving cognitive function and mood. It's like a software update for your brain, except instead of taking three hours and breaking everything, it actually works. ([Link to study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00909/full))

This is crucial for anyone wondering **how to stop overthinking and focus on health** while simultaneously improving **mental clarity** and **productivity and focus**. Plus, it's way cheaper than therapy (though therapy is also great, don't cancel your therapist).

# Strategy 6: The Power of ""So What?"" (Channel Your Inner Rebel)

This is one of my favorite **cognitive reframing** techniques because it's both effective and a little bit sassy. When you catch yourself spiraling with **negative thoughts**, hit it with the ""So what?"" question.

""What if I embarrass myself at the presentation?"" So what? ""What if people judge me?"" So what? They're probably too busy overthinking their own stuff to remember yours.

This technique, based on cognitive behavioral therapy, helps you challenge the actual consequences of your fears. Most of the time, when you really dig into what you're worried about, the worst-case scenario is... not that bad. Or it's something you can handle.

A meta-analysis in *Clinical Psychology Review* found that cognitive reframing techniques significantly reduce anxiety and overthinking by challenging the validity of anxious thoughts. ([Link to study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735806000420))

It's one of the best **ways to stop overthinking** because it forces your brain to actually justify why it's freaking out, and usually, your brain is like, ""You know what? I got nothing. This is actually not a big deal.""

# Strategy 7: Mindfulness Meditation (Not as Boring as It Sounds)

Okay, before you roll your eyes and skip this section, let me tell you: **mindfulness for overthinking** is one of the most researched and effective **meditation for overthinking** practices out there. And you don't have to sit like a pretzel and chant ""om"" for hours (unless you want to).

**Mindfulness exercises for focus** are about training your brain to observe thoughts without getting caught up in them. It's like watching clouds pass by instead of grabbing onto each cloud and letting it carry you away into a storm.

Start with just 5 minutes a day. Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. When thoughts come (and they WILL come—your brain is not going to suddenly become zen just because you asked nicely), just notice them and let them pass. Don't judge yourself for having thoughts. That's literally what brains do. They think. It's their whole thing.

Research published in *JAMA Internal Medicine* shows that **mindfulness meditation** significantly reduces anxiety, depression, and rumination while improving attention and focus. The study found that regular meditation practice actually changes brain structure, increasing gray matter density in areas associated with emotional regulation and decreasing activity in the amygdala. ([Link to study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754))

This is essential for **how to calm your mind**, **how to stay present**, and **stop mental chatter** that's keeping you from living your life. Plus, it's free, you can do it anywhere, and you don't need any special equipment. Just you and your chaotic brain, working things out.

# Strategy 8: The ""Not My Circus, Not My Monkeys"" Principle

This Polish proverb is about to become your new mantra, especially if you're someone who overthinks other people's problems, decisions, and drama. A lot of **overthinking relationships** comes from trying to control or predict things that are completely outside your control.

Your coworker's weird mood? Not your monkeys. What someone thinks about your outfit? Not your circus. Whether your friend's dating situation is going to work out? Definitely not your monkeys.

This is about setting **mental boundaries** and recognizing what is and isn't your responsibility to worry about. Cognitive psychologists call this ""locus of control""—understanding what you can actually influence versus what's outside your control.

A study in *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* found that people who focus on what they can control experience significantly less anxiety and rumination than those who try to control everything. ([Link to study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-01319-001))

This technique is gold for **how to stop overthinking relationships**, **how to stop worrying too much** about things that aren't your concern, and generally making your life way less stressful by minding your business (in the best possible way).

# Strategy 9: Create ""If-Then"" Plans (Give Your Brain a Script)

Your brain LOVES having a plan. Like, it's obsessed with plans. When you don't have a plan, your brain creates fifty hypothetical scenarios, none of which are helpful. This is where **if-then planning** comes in—one of the most effective **strategies to stop overthinking** decisions.

Instead of endlessly deliberating, create simple if-then statements:

* ""If I start overthinking before bed, then I'll do the 54321 technique""
* ""If I catch myself overanalyzing a text message, then I'll put my phone down for 10 minutes""
* ""If I'm stuck on a decision for more than 10 minutes, then I'll flip a coin""

Research published in *European Journal of Social Psychology* shows that if-then planning (also called implementation intentions) significantly increases the likelihood of following through on goals and reduces decision fatigue. ([Link to study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674))

This is crucial for **how to stop overthinking decisions** and **how to stop overthinking and focus on success** because you're taking the mental load off your brain. You're basically saying, ""Here's the playbook, brain. Just follow the plays.""

# Strategy 10: The Power Nap (Your Brain Needs a Break, People)

Listen, sometimes your brain is overthinking because it's TIRED. Like, it's been working overtime without a break, and it's starting to act up like a toddler who missed their nap.

Power naps (15-20 minutes) can significantly reduce mental fatigue and improve cognitive function. But here's the key: keep it under 30 minutes, or you'll wake up feeling like you were hit by a truck and questioning all your life choices.

Research in *Sleep* journal found that short naps improve alertness, cognitive performance, and emotional regulation while reducing the tendency toward rumination and anxiety. ([Link to study](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/35/5/605/2558955))

This is essential for **how to stop overthinking and sleep better** and **how to stop overthinking and focus on relaxation**. Sometimes the best thing you can do for your overactive brain is literally turn it off for a bit.

# Strategy 11: Limit Information Intake (Your Brain Isn't Google)

In today's world, we're bombarded with information 24/7. News, social media, emails, notifications—it's like trying to drink from a fire hose, except the water is anxiety-inducing headlines and your ex's vacation photos.

This constant information overload contributes to **mental health overthinking** because your brain is trying to process everything at once, which is impossible. It's like having 47 tabs open on your computer and wondering why it's running slow.

Set boundaries around your information consumption:

* Designate specific times to check news and social media
* Turn off non-essential notifications
* Do a ""digital detox"" for at least an hour before bed

A study in *Computers in Human Behavior* found that reducing social media use to 30 minutes per day significantly decreased anxiety, depression, and rumination. ([Link to study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563218303649))

This is vital for **how to declutter your mind**, **reduce stress and overthinking**, and actually have mental space to think about things that matter instead of what random people on the internet think about things that don't matter.

# Strategy 12: Practice Decision-Making Quickly (Kill Analysis Paralysis)

You know what makes overthinking worse? Trying to make the ""perfect"" decision. Spoiler alert: there is no perfect decision. There are just decisions, and then there's what you do with those decisions.

For small decisions (what to eat, what to wear, what to watch), give yourself a strict time limit: 30 seconds to 2 minutes maximum. For bigger decisions, set a reasonable deadline and stick to it.

Barry Schwartz's research on the ""paradox of choice"" shows that having too many options and spending too much time deliberating actually makes us less happy with our choices, not more. ([Link to research](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice))

This is crucial for **how to stop overthinking decisions**, **how to stop overanalyzing**, and **how to stop overthinking at work** where decision fatigue can seriously impact your productivity.

Here's the truth: most decisions are reversible. You can try something and change your mind. You're not signing a blood oath every time you pick what to have for lunch.

# Strategy 13: Use the ""Zoom Out"" Technique (Perspective is Everything)

When you're **overthinking everything**, you're usually zoomed WAY in on the problem, examining every tiny detail like it's evidence in a crime scene. The zoom out technique helps you **stop obsessive thinking** by looking at the bigger picture.

Ask yourself:

* In the grand scheme of my entire life, how significant is this?
* What would I tell a friend who was worried about this?
* Will anyone remember this a month from now?

This is based on cognitive distancing techniques used in therapy. Research in *Emotion* journal shows that viewing situations from a distanced perspective significantly reduces emotional reactivity and rumination. ([Link to study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-20241-001))

It's one of the best **mental clarity techniques** because it helps you see that your brain is making a mountain out of a molehill, and honestly, most of the time, it's not even a molehill. It's like a tiny bump in the ground that your brain decided was Mount Everest.

# Strategy 14: Harness the Power of ""Yet"" (Growth Mindset for the Win)

This is some Carol Dweck magic right here. When you catch yourself thinking, ""I can't stop overthinking"" or ""I'm not good at focusing,"" add the word ""yet"" to the end.

""I can't stop overthinking... yet."" ""I'm not good at focusing... yet.""

This simple word shift activates what psychologists call a ""growth mindset""—the belief that you can develop and improve through effort. Research shows that growth mindset significantly reduces anxiety and rumination by reframing challenges as opportunities rather than threats. ([Link to study](https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/))

This is powerful for **how to stop overthinking and focus on growth**, **how to stop overthinking and focus on positivity**, and generally reminding yourself that you're a work in progress, not a finished product. Your brain can change. Neural plasticity is real. You're not stuck like this forever.

# Strategy 15: The Social Connection Cure (Call Your Friend Already)

Here's something your brain doesn't want you to know: sometimes you need to get OUT of your head and into connection with other humans. **Overthinking and depression** often go hand in hand because isolation feeds rumination.

When you're stuck in an overthinking spiral, reach out to someone. Call a friend, text a family member, pet a dog (dogs are excellent therapists who work for treats).

Research published in *Psychological Science* shows that social connection activates neural networks that counteract anxiety and rumination. Talking to someone you trust can interrupt negative thought patterns and provide perspective you can't access alone. ([Link to study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613481631))

This is essential for **how to stop overthinking and be happy**, **how to stop overthinking and enjoy life**, and remembering that you're not alone in this. Everyone overthinks sometimes. Some people are just better at hiding it.

# Strategy 16: Progressive Muscle Relaxation (Clench and Release Your Way to Calm)

Here's a **concentration improvement method** that works through your body instead of trying to convince your brain directly: Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR). This technique involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups in your body, which triggers your parasympathetic nervous system (the ""rest and digest"" system).

Start with your toes, tense them for 5 seconds, then release. Move up through your body—calves, thighs, stomach, shoulders, face—tensing and releasing each muscle group.

A meta-analysis in *Behaviour Research and Therapy* found that PMR significantly reduces anxiety and rumination while improving sleep quality and mental clarity. ([Link to study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796799001409))

This works for **how to stop overthinking before sleep**, **how to stop worrying at night**, and **how to relax your mind** when it's been going a hundred miles per hour all day. Your body and mind are connected, so relaxing one helps relax the other.

# Strategy 17: Create Mental Compartments (The File Cabinet Technique)

Imagine your mind is a file cabinet (stay with me here). When a worry or intrusive thought pops up, visualize yourself taking that thought, putting it in a file folder, and filing it away in the appropriate drawer.

""Work stress? That goes in the Work drawer. We'll deal with that during work hours."" ""Relationship concern? That's for the Relationship drawer. We'll address that when we can actually do something about it.""

This **clear mind meditation** technique is based on cognitive compartmentalization, which research shows can reduce mental clutter and improve focus. A study in *Cognition and Emotion* found that mental organization strategies significantly decrease cognitive load and rumination. ([Link to study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699931.2013.781660))

This is great for **how to stop overthinking and focus on work**, **focus hacks for students**, and anyone who needs to **stop looping thoughts** by giving them a designated mental space instead of letting them run wild.

# Strategy 18: Engage in ""Flow"" Activities (Get Lost in What You Love)

Flow states—where you're so absorbed in an activity that you lose track of time—are the opposite of overthinking. When you're in flow, your brain literally can't overthink because it's fully engaged in what you're doing.

Find activities that challenge you just enough to hold your attention: playing music, painting, coding, cooking, rock climbing, solving puzzles, whatever lights you up.

Research by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi shows that regular flow experiences significantly reduce rumination and anxiety while increasing life satisfaction and mental wellbeing. ([Link to research](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness))

This is essential for **how to stop** [overthinking](https://medium.com/@tmapendembe/why-cant-i-sleep-15-surprising-factors-that-are-keeping-you-up-at-night-be7d8d88d6c7) **and focus on happiness**, **how to stop overthinking and focus on dreams**, and actually enjoying your life instead of spending all your time in your head worrying about it.

# Strategy 19: Challenge Your Thoughts Like a Lawyer (Evidence-Based Thinking)

When your brain presents you with an anxious thought, treat it like you're a lawyer and that thought is a witness. Cross-examine it. Ask for evidence.

""Everyone thinks I'm stupid."" Really? EVERYONE? All 8 billion people on Earth? Where's your evidence for this claim?

""I'm going to fail at this."" Based on what? What's your success rate historically? What actual evidence supports this prediction?

This is a core component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is one of the most effective treatments for anxiety and overthinking. Research in *Cognitive Therapy and Research* shows that challenging automatic negative thoughts significantly reduces rumination and anxiety. ([Link to study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10608-007-9161-1))

This technique is powerful for **overcome anxiety and overthinking**, **stop negative thoughts**, and **how to stop overthinking and gain clarity** by forcing your brain to actually back up its claims instead of just running wild with assumptions.

# Strategy 20: Practice Self-Compassion (Stop Being Mean to Yourself)

Here's the thing: a lot of overthinking comes from being harsh with yourself. You're basically running a 24/7 critical commentary on yourself in your own head, and then wondering why you're anxious all the time.

Research by Dr. Kristin Neff shows that self-compassion—treating yourself with the same kindness you'd show a good friend—significantly reduces rumination, anxiety, and depression while increasing resilience and mental wellbeing. ([Link to research](https://self-compassion.org/the-research/))

When you catch yourself overthinking or making a mistake, try talking to yourself like you would to someone you care about: Instead of: ""I'm so stupid, why did I do that?"" Try: ""Everyone makes mistakes. This doesn't define me. What can I learn from this?""

This is crucial for **how to stop overthinking and focus on inner peace**, **how to stop overthinking and focus on emotional health**, and **how to stop overthinking and focus on peace of mind**. You can't heal in an environment where you're constantly criticizing yourself.

# Putting It All Together: Your Action Plan to Stop Overthinking and Focus on Life

Alright, we've covered a LOT. Twenty strategies that'll help you **stop overthinking and focus on clarity**, **boost productivity**, and actually live your life instead of constantly analyzing it like it's a final exam.

Here's the thing though: don't try to do all twenty strategies at once. That's just going to stress you out more, and then you'll start overthinking whether you're doing the anti-overthinking strategies correctly. (See what I mean? Your brain is sneaky.)

Start with 2-3 strategies that resonate most with you. Maybe it's the 54321 technique for immediate relief, brain dumps for mental clarity, and scheduled worry time for ongoing management. Test them out for a week or two. See what works for your brain.

Remember, **how to stop overthinking and focus on mental health** is not about perfection. It's about progress. Some days you'll nail it. Some days your brain will still act like it's auditioning for a drama series. That's okay. You're human.

# The Bottom Line: Your Brain Needs Training, Not Judgement

Look, **overthinking** is your brain trying to protect you. It's just really bad at its job sometimes. It's like an overenthusiastic security guard who tackles everyone who walks through the door, even when they're just bringing you pizza.

These **strategies to stop overthinking** are about retraining that security guard. Teaching it when to actually sound the alarm versus when to just chill and let life happen.

The research is clear: you CAN change your thinking patterns. Neural plasticity means your brain can learn new ways of operating. But it takes practice, patience, and a lot of self-compassion.

So take these **focus improvement tips**, these **mental clarity techniques**, these **productivity and focus tips**, and start implementing them. Your brain might resist at first (change is scary, even when it's good), but stick with it.

And remember: the goal isn't to never think or analyze things. Thinking is good! Analyzing can be useful! The goal is to **stop overthinking** to the point where it paralyzes you, steals your joy, and keeps you from actually living your life.

You deserve to **stop overthinking and focus on happiness**. You deserve to **stop worrying too much** and start enjoying things. You deserve **peace of mind** and **mental clarity** and the ability to actually be present in your own life.

Your brain might not believe that yet. But keep working on it. Challenge those thoughts. Practice these strategies. Be patient with yourself.

And the next time you find yourself **overthinking everything** at 2 AM, remember: your brain is just trying to help. It's just really, really bad at it. Thank it for its concern, remind it that you've got this handled, and try one of these techniques.

You've got 20 tools now. Use them. Your peace of mind is worth it.

Now stop overthinking whether you're going to try these strategies, and just pick one and start. (See? I'm already helping.)

# Final Scientific Note

The strategies outlined here are based on decades of neuroscience and psychology research into anxiety, rumination, and cognitive behavioral interventions. While they're effective for most people, if you're experiencing severe anxiety, depression, or overthinking that significantly impacts your daily functioning, please reach out to a mental health professional. Sometimes we need more support than self-help strategies can provide, and that's completely okay.

[How to stop overthinking and focus on balance](https://youtu.be/4wRS_fyqNic?si=p5dQ0JxggiBbqcnR) sometimes means knowing when to ask for help. There's no shame in that. In fact, it's one of the smartest things you can do.

Now go out there and give your brain the training it needs. You've got this. (And if you don't believe that right now, that's fine too. Just fake it till you make it. Your brain can't tell the difference anyway.)

After putting off getting one done ""oh I'll just do Cologuard"" etc. and every stall tactic in the book, I finally bit the bullet last week after my wife pressured me into doing it.

Male, 49 years old btw.

For reference, I don't like any kind of medical experience and typically shy away from anything but the bare basics and try to DIY health stuff with alternative means. So this was a big deal for me.

I went the Sutab / pill route after hearing all the horror stories of liquid prep, and my procedure was at 1:30 in the afternoon. Fearing all kinds of stomach pain and being glued to the toilet I nervously started the first bottle of pills at 6pm the night before after a very lenient day-before prep routine. I could have even eaten a low fiber breakfast and lunch on this plan! Since I'm used to fasting, it was actually pretty bearable, I drank coffee, soda, Gatorlyte, water. Would have done broth and Jello but did not get around to it.

When the pills kicked in, it was really pretty uneventful. I just went to the bathroom a handful of times, no pain, just a progressive flush out that was surprisingly easy.

Stayed up late watching a show and got to bed around 1.

The next morning I took the simethicone and the last bottle of pills. Another round of clean out and stopped clear liquids at 9:30. I even had coffee that morning.

I could barely contain my stress on the drive over and nearly jumped out the window when they asked something about having a will at the front desk. Even though so many people were like - it's really easy, I was having a panic attack on the inside.

As the nurse was taking my info, I was seriously considering getting the hell out of there, but got into the stupid looking gown and went for it. I had to look away as she was putting the IV in because I HATE needles, but it was actually pretty smooth.

I started freaking out as they wheeled me into the room and had to close my eyes as not to see all the equipment. Thankfully the anesthesiologist gave me something ahead of the real stuff (propofol) to get me to calm down.

Then BAM, i start to come to out in the recovery area, pleasantly relaxed, no pain, and I came to somewhat normal consciousness within a few minutes. They found one polyp and said to come back in either 3 or 5 years.

I was feeling pretty normal for most of the rest of the day, and probably could have drove if i needed to.

All in all, I got myself extremely stressed out over something that was actually pretty easy.",3,1764007615.0,colonoscopy,1,1.0,False
1p5obe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1p5obe8/why_is_my_teeth_whitening_kit_not_working/,Why is my teeth whitening kit not working?,"You're using a teeth whitening kit, but your smile still looks the same. That's frustrating, right? Before you give up completely, let's figure out what's going wrong.

**You're Not Using It Long Enough**

Most people expect results after one or two uses. That's not how it works. Teeth whitening takes time. You need to stick with it for at least a week or two to see real changes. Check the instructions that came with your kit and follow the timeline exactly.

**Your Teeth Have Deep Stains**

If you drink coffee, tea, or soda every day, those stains go deep into your enamel. Surface-level whitening might not cut it. Some stains from medications or genetics are even harder to remove. In these cases, you might need a stronger whitening gel or professional treatment.

**The Gel Is Old or Weak**

Whitening gel loses its power over time. If your kit has been sitting in your bathroom for months, the hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide might be useless now. Always check expiration dates. Using fresh, quality products makes a huge difference. If you need a reliable option, you can check out [this teeth whitening kit](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) that people trust for consistent results.

**You're Not Applying It Correctly**

Are you putting enough gel on the trays? Are the trays actually touching your teeth? If there are air bubbles or gaps, the whitening agent can't do its job. Make sure the gel covers the front surface of each tooth evenly. Also, keep your mouth closed and avoid swallowing excess saliva during treatment.

**You Keep Eating Staining Foods**

Whitening your teeth while still drinking red wine and eating curry is like mopping the floor while someone's walking through with muddy shoes. Cut back on dark-colored foods and drinks during your whitening period. At least rinse your mouth with water after consuming anything that could stain.

**Your Expectations Are Too High**

Teeth whitening kits work, but they won't give you celebrity-white teeth overnight. Natural tooth color varies from person to person. You might get a few shades lighter, which is still a noticeable improvement. Don't compare your results to heavily filtered photos online.

**The LED Light Isn't Really Helping**

Many kits come with blue LED lights that claim to speed up whitening. The truth is, the light doesn't do much. The real work comes from the whitening gel itself. Don't stress if the light stops working—just focus on applying the gel properly.

**Final Thoughts**

Teeth whitening requires patience and consistency. If your current kit isn't working, make sure you're using it correctly and long enough. Check that your gel is fresh and strong. If you've tried everything and still see no results, it might be time to try a different product altogether. [Here's a teeth whitening kit](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) worth looking at if you want something that actually delivers.

Sometimes switching products makes all the difference. Just remember to follow instructions, avoid staining foods, and give it time. Your brighter smile is closer than you think.",1,1764007548.0,productplace,0,1.0,False

It also has a section in the back to hold extra cable.

I did some extensive testing to see how hot the base of the kettle gets, and this one barley heats up at all. The heating element is in the kettle, so the base doesn't get hot. So, I was comfortable printing this in PETG.

Hi there internet stranger !
I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am, mainly a buddy to text about everything and nothing and the glorious nonsense in between. If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :
I’m a 21 year old with ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then never listen to them again and end up hoarding them on my iPod. 

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I’m up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click.

Things to expect if we become friends
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

1p5o424,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1p5o424/thinking_about_selling_our_house_and_moving_back/,Thinking about selling our house and moving back to a walkable neighborhood… are we crazy for this?,"My wife and I are in our early 30s with two dogs. We bought a 1940s single family house in 2023 for around 560k, high interest rate and all. It’s a beautiful little MCM place with a great yard in a quiet, safe pocket of the city. On paper it checked every box.

The problem is… it’s not walkable. And I’m realizing how much that’s been dragging down my day to day. I work from home, and having neighborhood coffee shops or a third space used to be a huge part of my routine. Now I have to drive or bike everywhere, and it makes me feel weirdly isolated while all my friends live in the inner neighborhoods. It’s only a 15 minute drive but it still feels like I’m on the outskirts (of course, in America we're use to driving 30+ minutes to get anywhere). I just miss the feeling of stepping outside and walking to things.

There’s a lot I genuinely like. Having a garage and off-street parking is amazing. The yard, the garden, the quiet. But it turns out I don’t actually love maintaining any of it. Lawn care, pruning, random old-house issues… it’s relentless. Neither of us are handy or interested in becoming handy, and everything feels a little “delicate” because the house is old. It isn’t the kind of place I’d feel comfortable renting out either, since it needs consistent attention.

So we’ve been talking about moving next year. Probably to a condo or townhouse in the inner city, somewhere in the 350-450k range. High walkability in my favorite neighborhoods, near green space for the dogs, way lower maintenance. Honestly I feel that setup fits us more. And I like the idea that a condo or townhouse might be easier to rent out down the line if we ever needed that flexibility.

For context since this is r/financialindependence, our current net worth is around 1.2M, and our FIRE target is 1.8M. We’re on track, and slowing down or changing careers in the next few years is pretty appealing, so downsizing a bit doesn’t feel like a step backward.

Still, I’m in this weird regret spiral.  Buying and selling so soon in a short timeframe sucks. And the financial hit would be real, although it'd be manageable. Some of my friends don’t care much about walkability, so it’s hard to explain why it matters so much to me. It really is a personal thing, I guess.

The other stressor is the logistics. Is it even realistic these days to make an offer contingent on selling your current home? The whole process feels pretty overwhelming.

If anyone’s gone through something similar, I’d love to hear how you decided when it was worth taking the hit and moving somewhere that fits your actual day to day.",15,1764007120.0,financialindependence,21,0.83,False

* whether people actually like it or prefer other drinks,
* how they consume it (cold, hot, to-go, canned, etc.),
* which brands or styles work best,
* how a foreign coffee product might be received,
* and any cultural insights that could influence communication.

Another week another review. This week I am back with Dunu again. Well, I was blessed with another Dunu iem specifically Dunu Vulkan2. This is interesting iem. It is a hybrid & open back faceplate. So, me being curious person agreed to review it. Here we are at it.

First of all, thank you to SushiFi and Dunu for making this review possible. Without their help this review wouldn’t have been possible.

All opinions and thoughts are mine. I have not been paid or offered any compensation for the review.

Please keep in mind my bias towards DD sets. My preferences are DD>Hybrids>Planars. Also, my music choices. Please refer to my music genre section.

Now that all pleasantries have been done with Let’s get to meat and potatoes of review.

Build Quality:

What you get in the box

1 pair of iems

1 modular cable with 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm terminations

4 pairs of Dunu S & S ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu Candy ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu standard tips

1 cleaning tool

1 cleaning cloth

1 pair iem booties

1 Carrying case

As you can see Dunu has been generous towards included accessories. Dunu never disappoints in this department. Totally premium package.

Iem shells are made of cnc machined aerospace grade aluminium. They feel solid in hand. Faceplate has slats with mesh covering them. This is where it being open back stems from. Shells are medium size. Nozzles are also metal. Nozzles have lip on them. This helps gripping ear tips well. No risk of ear tips slipping off here. Nozzle length is adequate and provide deep insertion.

Stock cable is premium one, it is thick and multi core. The cable separator and terminations are made up of metal. Cable is modular and comes with Dunu Q lock system. It has 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm terminations which are swappable. Stock cable that came with this unit is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Dunu offers mmcx and 2 pin type both in cable and iem.

Sheer number of ear tips included makes it very easy to settle on most comfortable ear tip. You can see the number and variety of ear tips just go few lines up. These are premium ear tips.

Iem booties are great inclusion. There is cleaning cloth & tool also included. Provided case is leather or faux leather can’t comment. But the case is sturdy and hard. It will be useful to protect iems.

Comfort & Fit:

Shells being made up of metal don’t weight too much you can call them light. There is no soreness or discomfort felt during my extended listening. Shells are medium sized, yet I will ask people to do

demo before purchase.

Cable is not microphonic so no disturbance while listening to music. Ear hooks on the cable don’t tug on the iems.

Passive noise isolation is there. You can easily block outside noises up to 60% loud noises will still get in. As the shells have open back design, I don’t know how its providing good isolation. But isolation works.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5

Configuration:

2 DD + 6BA combination hybrid Iem. One 10mm DD + One 8mm DD, Unknown Knowles BAs. Advanced 4-way crossover with both physical and electronic one. Impedance, sensitivity & frequency range are unknown.

Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

Sources:

Sources from basic ones to hi end ones.

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix alpha xi 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient as when i used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7 > Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.

&#x200B;

Ear tips:

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips

best pairing that I found was with Dunu S & S ear tips for me.

Sound Impressions:

Bass / Lows:

Sub bass here is fast and quick type. It rumbles but not to point where you can feel it. You can hear it. Sub bass is less compared to mid bass. Mid bass here is good quality type. You can feel it. It is also quick and fast decay kind. Here the tuning is mid bass over sub bass. Bass is not for bass head lovers. This is neutral and treble head level bass.

Drums kick drums sound bit anemic as the reverberations are missing. Bass guitars the string reverberations are also not up to the point.

I personally think this is the weakest point of this set.

Overall Bass/Lows 3.5/5

Mids:

Mids are forward here. Vocals sound front centre. You can heart singer taking gulps of air. Male vocals are good but Female vocals shine here. Sibilance is present. “ch“ “t” “s” sound pronounced.

Instruments in Mids sound clear. String instruments sound good. There is clarity in instruments due to tuning choice.

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble / Highs:

Treble here is tuned well. There are enough macro & micro details. You will not miss any details.

Soundstage is wide and has average height. Yet this is not the widest set I have had pleasure to review. Layering and separation is good. There is no congestion or smearing. Positional queue are correct and on point. Holographic stage.

Treble here can become bit too much for people who are sensitive to treble.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5

Song Impressions:

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

This song is to check for vocals, layering & separation. Starting piano piece sounds great. Drum sticks and strike on their surface feel dull. Both Male & female vocals are great. String instruments are emphatic. Trumpets sound great. No smearing. All instruments are well separate.

Overall good quality reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack.

Bass check song for me. Here the entire song has subbass droning which you can hear and feel at the same time. This is lacking here. Vocals are good. Sub bass and mid bass are soul of this song, and they are anaemic here. So entire song feels bit let down.

Ego Death by Polyphia

This song is check for soundstage, layering, speed of drivers & separation. Here the lack of bass impact affects drums and guitar notes. They fell bit dull. Instruments are well separated and don’t smear each other. Song doesn’t get harsh or shrill. Which it can depending on tuning.

Overall acceptable reproduction.

Hotel California by Eagles

This is iconic song every audiophile knows. So using this song to check overall representation of it. Guitars which are usp of this song are well represented. Drums are not up to the mark. You can make out all the twinkies & sparkles in the song. Vocals are as they should be. Reproduction is good in terms of guitars, but the bass impact is missing. That makes this song more enjoyable. No harshness or shrillness was encountered.

Overall adequate reproduction.

Final Conclusion:

Dunu knows how to make great sets. Look at single DD sets they are all legends in their respective price brackets. Yet when it comes to hybrids. They have been bit hit & miss. SA6 was massive hit & remains as legend. So, I had high regard that this set might be next best hybrid from Dunu.

Here in Vulkan2 it has the technical prowess that Dunu is well known for. Vocals are excellent. Soundstage feel wide and tall. Yet all this is negated by lack of bass impact in the tuning. It makes the tuning incomplete for me. I feel if Dunu had provided bass like their DD sets, this would have been one of the best releases from them in hybrid sets.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not negating anything done right here by Dunu. If you are detail chaser and stage hound this set will please you. For Mid Fi set this has lot of things right. Just Bass heads this is not for you.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of hot coffee and kick your legs up, start jamming to music you love. See you soon in another review.

1p5o256,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukmedinterviews/comments/1p5o256/interview_day_what_to_wear_what_to_do_and_how_not/,"Interview Day: What to Wear, What to Do, and How Not to Panic — A Full Guide for Applicants","Everyone prepares for interviews… but almost nobody prepares for **interview day**.  
And honestly? That’s when most people fall apart.

People wear uncomfortable clothes, leave too late, don’t warm up their voice, panic in the waiting room, or freeze the moment they sit down.  
This guide covers the *actual* practical stuff: what to wear, how to act, what to bring, and how to keep your brain switched on when it matters.

If people want, I’m happy to add a checklist or photo examples in the comments.

# 1. The Night Before: Set Yourself Up Properly

Most bad interview days start the night before.

# Re-read your interview email

Seriously. Do it again.  
It usually tells you:

* What ID to bring
* If there’s a briefing
* Whether they’ll have role-plays, data stations, etc
* Where you actually need to go (this catches people out every year)

# Pack everything

Put it by the door:

* ID (passport/driving licence)
* Water bottle
* Travel tickets
* Snack (banana/cereal bar)
* Portable charger
* Hairbrush/tissues
* Pen
* Interview invite

Don’t leave ANY of this to the morning. Interview-day you will forget half of it.

# No last-minute cramming

You won’t magically absorb ethics at 11pm.

Do:

* skim ethics pillars
* skim your structure frameworks
* glance at NHS current topics

Then close everything.

# Sleep

Even if it’s rubbish, don’t stress.  
Everyone sleeps badly before big events. Your adrenaline will save you.

# 2. What to Wear (The Stress-Free Formula)

This is a medical school interview, not London Fashion Week.  
Your outfit should be:

* clean
* neat
* simple
* comfortable
* not distracting

**If in doubt: you’re aiming for “professional sixth form awards night”.**

# For literally anyone:

* Blazer or suit jacket
* Plain shirt/blouse (white/blue/pastel)
* Smart trousers, chinos, or knee-length skirt
* Clean, closed shoes

# Colours that are always safe:

* Navy
* Grey
* Black
* Soft pastel shirt under a dark blazer

# Makeup & Hair:

* Natural
* Hair out of your face (don’t keep tucking it behind your ear — huge nervous giveaway)

# Jewellery:

* Minimal
* No jangly bracelets that’ll clink when you move

# Perfume/aftershave:

* Barely any. Interview rooms can be tiny.

# Online interviews:

Wear smart bottoms too.  
People *have* been asked to stand up for ID checks.

# 3. Morning of the Interview

# Eat something normal

Avoid:

* huge portions
* anything greasy
* trying a “new breakfast”

Good choices:

* porridge
* toast + eggs
* yogurt + fruit

Coffee is fine — just don’t triple-shot it and shake through your answers.

# Warm yourself up

This is the part no one tells you:

**You need to warm up your voice and your brain**  
or your first answer will sound shaky.

Try:

* answer *one* basic question out loud (e.g., “Why medicine?”)
* say a random paragraph from a book to get your voice going
* 30 seconds of deep breathing
* stretch your shoulders

You’re basically switching on “Interview Mode”.

# 4. Travelling There (or Logging On)

# Arrive EARLY — but not ridiculous amounts early

Aim to be:

* 30–45 mins early in person
* 20 mins early online

More than that and your nerves just stew.

# If it’s online:

* check lighting (face towards a window if possible)
* test camera/mic
* clean your background
* put your phone on airplane mode
* look at your camera!!! not your screen ( I put sticky note arrows pointing towards it!)

# Hydrate strategically

Small sips, not chugging.  
Dry mouth = nervous voice  
Too much water = unexpected toilet trip

# 5. When You Arrive

This part matters more than people think.

# Posture matters

Walk in with:

* shoulders back
* gentle smile
* calm pace

Receptionists and student helpers DO notice attitude.  
You’re being observed more than you realise.

# Don’t get sucked into the waiting-room panic circle

If chatting calms you, go ahead.  
If it stresses you, stay in your own lane.

# 6. Before You Go In (The 2-Minute Reset)

Right before your name is called:

Do:

* deep breath
* relax shoulders
* tiny smile (it relaxes your face muscles)
* remind yourself: **“They invited me because they think I can be a doctor.”**

Don’t:

* reread notes
* check your phone
* whisper possible answers to yourself
* panic compare with other applicants

# 7. During the Interview

# Entering

* Knock
* Smile
* “Hello, nice to meet you.”
* Wait to be asked to sit

# Answering questions

Use your frameworks — but don’t sound like a robot reading off cue cards.

Aim for:

* calm
* structured
* reflective
* patient-focused

# If you freeze:

Take a breath and say:

>

This is completely normal.

# For weird/curveball questions:

They’re testing how you think, not whether you magically know the answer.

# For role-plays:

* Be human
* Listen actively
* Use empathy naturally
* No cringe “doctor voice”

# 8. Finishing Up

# How to end:

* “Thank you very much for your time.”
* Small smile
* Leave calmly

Short. Simple. Professional.

Don’t ask for immediate feedback — they legally can’t give you any.

# 9. After the Interview (Same Day)

Walk, eat, watch Netflix, whatever.  
Your brain needs to switch off.

Some folks are also married to someone who is sick and simply won't get help.

Why do you stay, knowing that things may never improve? I wish I could answer, myself.

My friends, my therapist, the internet, etc. are pretty unanimous in pushing me to divorce. Some of her ""churches"" also encourage her false belief that I am casting spells and practicing dark arts against her, and outright say she can't attend if she's still married. The only people who really encourage me to stay in the marriage are her parents, who are coming soon. I hope they see first-hand how bad it is. Between the parents coming, birthdays coming up, and the holidays, I feel pressured to rough it out for the time being.

Though I will say, the last few days have been tolerable. She even cleaned her room last night. Her tone's been far less aggressive, and she's been targeting others with her paranoia, like saying the churches she's recently visited are praying against her.

But at the same time, I look at my bank account this month or so since she came back home and the money's flying away like water. She's taken my card and used it to buy $400 in bibles, donate large amounts money to televangelists (again), and $900 in baby dresses and shoes without running any of it past me. ""If you don't like it, you should make more money."" So of course, I have no choice but to deny her access to any of my cards. She has a card on my line and I limit to something she can use to get herself coffee with. I never put a limit on her card before.

Divorce is expensive, not divorcing is expensive. I don't even feel in love with her. I can't answer why I am not divorcing her. On top of the stress and the costs, she has made some damaging allegations against me in the past that were expensive to combat. The last few times she went bananas, she dared me to call the police and alluded to making similar allegations again. ""I guess you want to spend all that money again.""

I just hate it all. I could see what happens with her parents, but it would really take a miracle. I really wish the family could just be together. But maybe the best thing is to be together, separately.",1,1764006973.0,SchizoFamilies,0,1.0,False

Another week another review. This week I am back with Dunu again. Well, I was blessed with another Dunu iem specifically Dunu Vulkan2. This is interesting iem. It is a hybrid & open back faceplate. So, me being curious person agreed to review it. Here we are at it.

First of all, thank you to SushiFi and Dunu for making this review possible. Without their help this review wouldn’t have been possible.

All opinions and thoughts are mine. I have not been paid or offered any compensation for the review.

Please keep in mind my bias towards DD sets. My preferences are DD>Hybrids>Planars. Also, my music choices. Please refer to my music genre section.

Now that all pleasantries have been done with Let’s get to meat and potatoes of review.

Build Quality:

What you get in the box

1 pair of iems

1 modular cable with 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm terminations

4 pairs of Dunu S & S ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu Candy ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu standard tips

1 cleaning tool

1 cleaning cloth

1 pair iem booties

1 Carrying case

As you can see Dunu has been generous towards included accessories. Dunu never disappoints in this department. Totally premium package.

Iem shells are made of cnc machined aerospace grade aluminium. They feel solid in hand. Faceplate has slats with mesh covering them. This is where it being open back stems from. Shells are medium size. Nozzles are also metal. Nozzles have lip on them. This helps gripping ear tips well. No risk of ear tips slipping off here. Nozzle length is adequate and provide deep insertion.

Stock cable is premium one, it is thick and multi core. The cable separator and terminations are made up of metal. Cable is modular and comes with Dunu Q lock system. It has 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm terminations which are swappable. Stock cable that came with this unit is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Dunu offers mmcx and 2 pin type both in cable and iem.

Sheer number of ear tips included makes it very easy to settle on most comfortable ear tip. You can see the number and variety of ear tips just go few lines up. These are premium ear tips.

Iem booties are great inclusion. There is cleaning cloth & tool also included. Provided case is leather or faux leather can’t comment. But the case is sturdy and hard. It will be useful to protect iems.

Comfort & Fit:

Shells being made up of metal don’t weight too much you can call them light. There is no soreness or discomfort felt during my extended listening. Shells are medium sized, yet I will ask people to do

demo before purchase.

Cable is not microphonic so no disturbance while listening to music. Ear hooks on the cable don’t tug on the iems.

Passive noise isolation is there. You can easily block outside noises up to 60% loud noises will still get in. As the shells have open back design, I don’t know how its providing good isolation. But isolation works.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5

Configuration:

2 DD + 6BA combination hybrid Iem. One 10mm DD + One 8mm DD, Unknown Knowles BAs. Advanced 4-way crossover with both physical and electronic one. Impedance, sensitivity & frequency range are unknown.

Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

&#x200B;

https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/test-tracks/pl.u-8aAVXG6ivz8gyxX?ls

Sources:

Sources from basic ones to hi end ones.

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix alpha xi 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient as when i used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7 > Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.

&#x200B;

Ear tips:

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips

best pairing that I found was with Dunu S & S ear tips for me.

Sound Impressions:

Bass / Lows:

Sub bass here is fast and quick type. It rumbles but not to point where you can feel it. You can hear it. Sub bass is less compared to mid bass. Mid bass here is good quality type. You can feel it. It is also quick and fast decay kind. Here the tuning is mid bass over sub bass. Bass is not for bass head lovers. This is neutral and treble head level bass.

Drums kick drums sound bit anemic as the reverberations are missing. Bass guitars the string reverberations are also not up to the point.

I personally think this is the weakest point of this set.

Overall Bass/Lows 3.5/5

Mids:

Mids are forward here. Vocals sound front centre. You can heart singer taking gulps of air. Male vocals are good but Female vocals shine here. Sibilance is present. “ch“ “t” “s” sound pronounced.

Instruments in Mids sound clear. String instruments sound good. There is clarity in instruments due to tuning choice.

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble / Highs:

Treble here is tuned well. There are enough macro & micro details. You will not miss any details.

Soundstage is wide and has average height. Yet this is not the widest set I have had pleasure to review. Layering and separation is good. There is no congestion or smearing. Positional queue are correct and on point. Holographic stage.

Treble here can become bit too much for people who are sensitive to treble.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5

Song Impressions:

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

This song is to check for vocals, layering & separation. Starting piano piece sounds great. Drum sticks and strike on their surface feel dull. Both Male & female vocals are great. String instruments are emphatic. Trumpets sound great. No smearing. All instruments are well separate.

Overall good quality reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack.

Bass check song for me. Here the entire song has subbass droning which you can hear and feel at the same time. This is lacking here. Vocals are good. Sub bass and mid bass are soul of this song, and they are anaemic here. So entire song feels bit let down.

Ego Death by Polyphia

This song is check for soundstage, layering, speed of drivers & separation. Here the lack of bass impact affects drums and guitar notes. They fell bit dull. Instruments are well separated and don’t smear each other. Song doesn’t get harsh or shrill. Which it can depending on tuning.

Overall acceptable reproduction.

Hotel California by Eagles

This is iconic song every audiophile knows. So using this song to check overall representation of it. Guitars which are usp of this song are well represented. Drums are not up to the mark. You can make out all the twinkies & sparkles in the song. Vocals are as they should be. Reproduction is good in terms of guitars, but the bass impact is missing. That makes this song more enjoyable. No harshness or shrillness was encountered.

Overall adequate reproduction.

Final Conclusion:

Dunu knows how to make great sets. Look at single DD sets they are all legends in their respective price brackets. Yet when it comes to hybrids. They have been bit hit & miss. SA6 was massive hit & remains as legend. So, I had high regard that this set might be next best hybrid from Dunu.

Here in Vulkan2 it has the technical prowess that Dunu is well known for. Vocals are excellent. Soundstage feel wide and tall. Yet all this is negated by lack of bass impact in the tuning. It makes the tuning incomplete for me. I feel if Dunu had provided bass like their DD sets, this would have been one of the best releases from them in hybrid sets.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not negating anything done right here by Dunu. If you are detail chaser and stage hound this set will please you. For Mid Fi set this has lot of things right. Just Bass heads this is not for you.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of hot coffee and kick your legs up, start jamming to music you love. See you soon in another review.

1p5nxdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveDysfunction/comments/1p5nxdz/roast_my_executive_dysfunction_app_that_nags_me/,Roast my executive dysfunction app that nags me with 6am hungry-cat energy: It's AI because I ghost humans. Looking for brutal testers...not customers.,"Buckle up, so I built this AI app to see if it helps my executive dysfunction, but sadly it raised more questions than answers:

1. Does it work on me just because I built it? (placebo effect?)
2. Can my code handle more users than just me? (is it scalable?)
3. Can the server handle more users than just me? (does the server crash under load?)
4. Can the AI phone system keep up, or will it crash and burn with multiple simultaneous calls at the exact same time? (my curiosity is peaking)
5. Will my wife find out if I need to upgrade the server ($$$) while I’m giving away free usage to answer my burning questions? (my plan would be to tell her it’s my Christmas present)

Worst case scenario: it’s an effective placebo that works on me (total win in my book).  
Best case: these questions get answered.



My name is Danny. About 20 years ago I walked into my doctor’s office and told him I had ADHD. With a skeptical look on his face he said, “You need to call xyz person at the university to get tested” triggering my RSD with a task that, paradoxically, requires executive function (which I obviously lack) in order to get help.

I never went back (grudges are my thing, also parenthesis).



**How did I make an app with executive dysfunction?**

1. Making apps (adding features, making changes, solving bugs) is a high‑dopamine hyperfocus activity for me with immediate reward.
2. I made this system for myself and as soon as it worked (and before the novelty wore off) I used it to push me through the low‑dopamine, maximally boring drudgery like putting the copyright lines in the footer of the app with terms and conditions and privacy policies (can’t get more boring than that).

The #1 thing I fear people will say is: **“It’s AI… ew!”**  
But for me personally, I think it only works *because* it’s AI. Hear me out.

I won’t answer a phone call from another human unless it’s an immediate family member… period. If it’s AI, I’ll answer it because it’s just… a predictable machine. I also made it leave a voicemail because that helped me ghost it if I happen to get locked into a task.

I tell the AI I’m dropping my kid off at school, grabbing coffee, picking up breakfast, wasting time taking my car through the car wash it lets me go through the organic routine that is my morning, wherever my free‑range mind leads me. It might catch me at the right time and right place to get something done and then I start, or it might try all day and still nothing happens. But at least it tried, and it’ll try again the next day.

(Random intrusive thought: my brain actually loves talking or typing with AI, it’s probably the zero judgment zero consequence aspect.)

But what about AI knowing my task? Yup, I hear that. But for me executive dysfunction is worse than telling AI that my vehicle registration expired three years ago (ngl).

That’s it, that’s the post (I’m mentally done rn).

(Almost forgot this part.) If you’re in the U.S. (I scoped it for the U.S. as a strategy to make it easy/bite‑size for me, but later it could possibly be more but I have too many unanswered questions to keep increasing the scope), DM me if you’d like access and I’ll load up your account with free calls in exchange for feedback.",2,1764006725.0,ExecutiveDysfunction,0,1.0,False

I’ve read a few comments about Kiss the hippo going downhill. The cafe experience was good. I hope I can dial in the beans easily and see what’s it’s like at home.

Anyone still grabbing beans from them? My last bag was Red Brick (Square Mile) which was lovely, although I had hard time to dial in.

What London cafe / beans you’re on at the moment?

1p5nuvf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5nuvf,Dunu Vulkan 2,"Dunu Vulkan2

Another week another review. This week I am back with Dunu again. Well, I was blessed with another Dunu iem specifically Dunu Vulkan2. This is interesting iem. It is a hybrid & open back faceplate. So, me being curious person agreed to review it. Here we are at it.

First of all, thank you to SushiFi and Dunu for making this review possible. Without their help this review wouldn’t have been possible.

All opinions and thoughts are mine. I have not been paid or offered any compensation for the review.

Please keep in mind my bias towards DD sets. My preferences are DD>Hybrids>Planars. Also, my music choices. Please refer to my music genre section.

Now that all pleasantries have been done with Let’s get to meat and potatoes of review.

Build Quality:

What you get in the box

1 pair of iems

1 modular cable with 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm terminations

4 pairs of Dunu S & S ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu Candy ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu standard tips

1 cleaning tool

1 cleaning cloth

1 pair iem booties

1 Carrying case

As you can see Dunu has been generous towards included accessories. Dunu never disappoints in this department. Totally premium package.

Iem shells are made of cnc machined aerospace grade aluminium. They feel solid in hand. Faceplate has slats with mesh covering them. This is where it being open back stems from. Shells are medium size. Nozzles are also metal. Nozzles have lip on them. This helps gripping ear tips well. No risk of ear tips slipping off here. Nozzle length is adequate and provide deep insertion.

Stock cable is premium one, it is thick and multi core. The cable separator and terminations are made up of metal. Cable is modular and comes with Dunu Q lock system. It has 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm terminations which are swappable. Stock cable that came with this unit is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Dunu offers mmcx and 2 pin type both in cable and iem.

Sheer number of ear tips included makes it very easy to settle on most comfortable ear tip. You can see the number and variety of ear tips just go few lines up. These are premium ear tips.

Iem booties are great inclusion. There is cleaning cloth & tool also included. Provided case is leather or faux leather can’t comment. But the case is sturdy and hard. It will be useful to protect iems.

Comfort & Fit:

Shells being made up of metal don’t weight too much you can call them light. There is no soreness or discomfort felt during my extended listening. Shells are medium sized, yet I will ask people to do

demo before purchase.

Cable is not microphonic so no disturbance while listening to music. Ear hooks on the cable don’t tug on the iems.

Passive noise isolation is there. You can easily block outside noises up to 60% loud noises will still get in. As the shells have open back design, I don’t know how its providing good isolation. But isolation works.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5

Configuration:

2 DD + 6BA combination hybrid Iem. One 10mm DD + One 8mm DD, Unknown Knowles BAs. Advanced 4-way crossover with both physical and electronic one. Impedance, sensitivity & frequency range are unknown.

Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

&#x200B;

https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/test-tracks/pl.u-8aAVXG6ivz8gyxX?ls

Sources:

Sources from basic ones to hi end ones.

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix alpha xi 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient as when i used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7 > Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.

&#x200B;

Ear tips:

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips

best pairing that I found was with Dunu S & S ear tips for me.

Sound Impressions:

Bass / Lows:

Sub bass here is fast and quick type. It rumbles but not to point where you can feel it. You can hear it. Sub bass is less compared to mid bass. Mid bass here is good quality type. You can feel it. It is also quick and fast decay kind. Here the tuning is mid bass over sub bass. Bass is not for bass head lovers. This is neutral and treble head level bass.

Drums kick drums sound bit anemic as the reverberations are missing. Bass guitars the string reverberations are also not up to the point.

I personally think this is the weakest point of this set.

Overall Bass/Lows 3.5/5

Mids:

Mids are forward here. Vocals sound front centre. You can heart singer taking gulps of air. Male vocals are good but Female vocals shine here. Sibilance is present. “ch“ “t” “s” sound pronounced.

Instruments in Mids sound clear. String instruments sound good. There is clarity in instruments due to tuning choice.

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble / Highs:

Treble here is tuned well. There are enough macro & micro details. You will not miss any details.

Soundstage is wide and has average height. Yet this is not the widest set I have had pleasure to review. Layering and separation is good. There is no congestion or smearing. Positional queue are correct and on point. Holographic stage.

Treble here can become bit too much for people who are sensitive to treble.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5

Song Impressions:

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

This song is to check for vocals, layering & separation. Starting piano piece sounds great. Drum sticks and strike on their surface feel dull. Both Male & female vocals are great. String instruments are emphatic. Trumpets sound great. No smearing. All instruments are well separate.

Overall good quality reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack.

Bass check song for me. Here the entire song has subbass droning which you can hear and feel at the same time. This is lacking here. Vocals are good. Sub bass and mid bass are soul of this song, and they are anaemic here. So entire song feels bit let down.

Ego Death by Polyphia

This song is check for soundstage, layering, speed of drivers & separation. Here the lack of bass impact affects drums and guitar notes. They fell bit dull. Instruments are well separated and don’t smear each other. Song doesn’t get harsh or shrill. Which it can depending on tuning.

Overall acceptable reproduction.

Hotel California by Eagles

This is iconic song every audiophile knows. So using this song to check overall representation of it. Guitars which are usp of this song are well represented. Drums are not up to the mark. You can make out all the twinkies & sparkles in the song. Vocals are as they should be. Reproduction is good in terms of guitars, but the bass impact is missing. That makes this song more enjoyable. No harshness or shrillness was encountered.

Overall adequate reproduction.

Final Conclusion:

Dunu knows how to make great sets. Look at single DD sets they are all legends in their respective price brackets. Yet when it comes to hybrids. They have been bit hit & miss. SA6 was massive hit & remains as legend. So, I had high regard that this set might be next best hybrid from Dunu.

Here in Vulkan2 it has the technical prowess that Dunu is well known for. Vocals are excellent. Soundstage feel wide and tall. Yet all this is negated by lack of bass impact in the tuning. It makes the tuning incomplete for me. I feel if Dunu had provided bass like their DD sets, this would have been one of the best releases from them in hybrid sets.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not negating anything done right here by Dunu. If you are detail chaser and stage hound this set will please you. For Mid Fi set this has lot of things right. Just Bass heads this is not for you.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of hot coffee and kick your legs up, start jamming to music you love. See you soon in another review.

As part of the Chief Information Security Organization (CISO), the GRC team operates at the intersection of technology, legal guidance, and proactive risk management.

At Instacart, we believe in empowering each team member with significant ownership and responsibility, fostering a culture of collaboration, and providing opportunities for leaders who are ready to make an impact.
### **About the Job**

In this role, you will:
  * Lead the development and operations of Privacy and Data Governance methodologies, partnering cross-functionally with product, engineering, and legal teams.
  * Translate high-level regulatory and legal guidance into detailed, technical plans and processes that mitigate risks while balancing operational needs.
  * Develop scalable solutions for testing, monitoring, and communicating data governance controls, leveraging automation where possible to ensure compliance and drive efficiency. This includes investigating and tracing complex data flows, schemas, and source systems to inform decision-making and ensure accuracy.
  * Collaborate with global teams to manage risks for emerging product lines and international operations, ensuring precision and consistency across regions.
  * Foster a results-driven, collaborative culture by influencing stakeholders, articulating risks and technical issues with clarity, and driving consensus on scalable solutions.


This role blends deep technical problem-solving with high-level operational strategy, making it a fantastic opportunity for someone excited to work on challenging problems with real-world impact in a fast-paced environment.

1p5nstv,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1p5nstv/liar_roommate/,Liar roommate,"Alright, so me and my best friend (both 19F) moved in with a friend we met in college (also 19F) and things went alright the first few months. But recently, all the dishes have been going missing. My bestie got our plates and bowls and stuff from her grandparents. I bought the silverware and cups. Our third roommate didn’t supply much to the apartment aside from a couch, microwave, vacuum, and coffee table. None of which she spent money on, by the way, her parents got it all. Her mom was getting rid of the couch, they got the coffee table from a neighbor, that sort of thing. 

But anyway, all the dishes start going missing. Two of my cups have been missing for two months. I ask my roommates where my cups are. They’re not in my room they’re not in bestie’s room, our third roommate is the only one who uses my cups regularly. So I ask, “where are my cups at? We’ve been missing two for a month now and I don’t want to be missing dishes” 
And she gets upset at me, saying “they’re not in my room I can’t believe youd think they’re in my room when they’re not why would they be” 

And yeah alright, I thought maybe I’m crazy and the 8 cup set I bought was actually only 6! Whatever! 

But then we were missing half the silverware and most the bowls and a couple plates. So my friend and I left a note on the fridge (after a literal month of asking the third roommate to put dishes back in the kitchen and not keep them in her room and she keeps lying and saying she doesn’t have them) saying that if dishes weren’t back in the kitchen by the time I got home at 3, we would go looking for them. 

So we did! Those two cups the roommate said she didn’t have? Under her desk with the chopsticks she accused us of taking. Her room was gross, hoarder levels of gross with molded food under the bed. We managed to recover all the dishes, aside from two of my forks sadly, but almost all the dishes she said she didn’t have! Surprisingly in her room! 

She came home while me and my friend were busy washing all our dishes, and god she was mad we went to retrieve our dishes. Like girl come on, we asked multiple times, and I gave a warning saying that I would go to get my dishes back. 

So now my friend and I have been keeping our dishes in our room, because, keep in mind, this roommate has her own dishes. She just never fucking does her dishes and uses all the dishes we wash. So now if she wants to eat she needs to wash her own dishes. 

And god I wish this was my only complaint about this roommate but there’s so many other complaints I have. Living with her SUCKS 

Like, she’s upset I went through her room to get back our dishes, I get that, but I gave her multiple warnings and asked for a month to have dishes put back, and she LIED about my cups, and two of my forks are still likely lost somewhere in her mess. 

Luckily she said she wants to move before the lease is up because “I feel like I can’t ever do anything in my own home!” Fuck her the two of us are like never home, she spends the most time at home and doesn’t even go to her  classes all the time. She’s deep cleaned the apartment once in the half year weve been here and never cleans up after herself in the kitchen. She’s an awful roommate, never once cleaned my crock pot after using it, ruined one of my pans, and never emptied the lint trap on my dryer. ",2,1764006449.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

1 modular cable with 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm terminations

4 pairs of Dunu S & S ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu Candy ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu standard tips

1 cleaning tool

1 cleaning cloth

1 pair iem booties

1 Carrying case

As you can see Dunu has been generous towards included accessories. Dunu never disappoints in this department. Totally premium package.

Iem shells are made of cnc machined aerospace grade aluminium. They feel solid in hand. Faceplate has slats with mesh covering them. This is where it being open back stems from. Shells are medium size. Nozzles are also metal. Nozzles have lip on them. This helps gripping ear tips well. No risk of ear tips slipping off here. Nozzle length is adequate and provide deep insertion.

Stock cable is premium one, it is thick and multi core. The cable separator and terminations are made up of metal. Cable is modular and comes with Dunu Q lock system. It has 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm terminations which are swappable. Stock cable that came with this unit is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Dunu offers mmcx and 2 pin type both in cable and iem.

Sheer number of ear tips included makes it very easy to settle on most comfortable ear tip. You can see the number and variety of ear tips just go few lines up. These are premium ear tips.

Iem booties are great inclusion. There is cleaning cloth & tool also included. Provided case is leather or faux leather can’t comment. But the case is sturdy and hard. It will be useful to protect iems.

Comfort & Fit:

Shells being made up of metal don’t weight too much you can call them light. There is no soreness or discomfort felt during my extended listening. Shells are medium sized, yet I will ask people to do

demo before purchase.

Cable is not microphonic so no disturbance while listening to music. Ear hooks on the cable don’t tug on the iems.

Passive noise isolation is there. You can easily block outside noises up to 60% loud noises will still get in. As the shells have open back design, I don’t know how its providing good isolation. But isolation works.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5

This iem is very efficient as when i used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7 > Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.

Ear tips:

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips

best pairing that I found was with Dunu S & S ear tips for me.

Sound Impressions:

Bass / Lows:

Sub bass here is fast and quick type. It rumbles but not to point where you can feel it. You can hear it. Sub bass is less compared to mid bass. Mid bass here is good quality type. You can feel it. It is also quick and fast decay kind. Here the tuning is mid bass over sub bass. Bass is not for bass head lovers. This is neutral and treble head level bass.

Drums kick drums sound bit anemic as the reverberations are missing. Bass guitars the string reverberations are also not up to the point.

I personally think this is the weakest point of this set.

Overall Bass/Lows 3.5/5

Mids:

Mids are forward here. Vocals sound front centre. You can heart singer taking gulps of air. Male vocals are good but Female vocals shine here. Sibilance is present. “ch“ “t” “s” sound pronounced.

Instruments in Mids sound clear. String instruments sound good. There is clarity in instruments due to tuning choice.

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble / Highs:

Treble here is tuned well. There are enough macro & micro details. You will not miss any details.

Soundstage is wide and has average height. Yet this is not the widest set I have had pleasure to review. Layering and separation is good. There is no congestion or smearing. Positional queue are correct and on point. Holographic stage.

Treble here can become bit too much for people who are sensitive to treble.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5

Song Impressions:

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

This song is to check for vocals, layering & separation. Starting piano piece sounds great. Drum sticks and strike on their surface feel dull. Both Male & female vocals are great. String instruments are emphatic. Trumpets sound great. No smearing. All instruments are well separate.

Overall good quality reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack.

Bass check song for me. Here the entire song has subbass droning which you can hear and feel at the same time. This is lacking here. Vocals are good. Sub bass and mid bass are soul of this song, and they are anaemic here. So entire song feels bit let down.

Ego Death by Polyphia

This song is check for soundstage, layering, speed of drivers & separation. Here the lack of bass impact affects drums and guitar notes. They fell bit dull. Instruments are well separated and don’t smear each other. Song doesn’t get harsh or shrill. Which it can depending on tuning.

Overall acceptable reproduction.

Hotel California by Eagles

This is iconic song every audiophile knows. So using this song to check overall representation of it. Guitars which are usp of this song are well represented. Drums are not up to the mark. You can make out all the twinkies & sparkles in the song. Vocals are as they should be. Reproduction is good in terms of guitars, but the bass impact is missing. That makes this song more enjoyable. No harshness or shrillness was encountered.

Overall adequate reproduction.

Final Conclusion:

Dunu knows how to make great sets. Look at single DD sets they are all legends in their respective price brackets. Yet when it comes to hybrids. They have been bit hit & miss. SA6 was massive hit & remains as legend. So, I had high regard that this set might be next best hybrid from Dunu.

Here in Vulkan2 it has the technical prowess that Dunu is well known for. Vocals are excellent. Soundstage feel wide and tall. Yet all this is negated by lack of bass impact in the tuning. It makes the tuning incomplete for me. I feel if Dunu had provided bass like their DD sets, this would have been one of the best releases from them in hybrid sets.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not negating anything done right here by Dunu. If you are detail chaser and stage hound this set will please you. For Mid Fi set this has lot of things right. Just Bass heads this is not for you.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of hot coffee and kick your legs up, start jamming to music you love. See you soon in another review.

1p5nr3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p5nr3k/eating_issues/,Eating issues.,"25F, 118lb, 5'6-5'7, no medications or substances. Diagnosed with ADHD and depression with dissociative symptoms, pretty sure I have PTSD.

I have a lot of issues with food. I've always been underweight, picky, negligent about food and I am DONE! I am tired of being tired, irritable, feeling weak, etc. because I cannot get myself to eat. When it was worse a couple of years ago, I would actually get so hungry I would begin to bite my hands unconsciously, and now I fear they are scarred.

Growing up, I only liked to eat milk, pork, and chicken. I thought sugar was disgusting, and that was what we mainly had in the house, so I was a very thin child. I was always too tired to get out of bed, and up until middle school my mother had to dress me in bed because I could not wake up. I was always irritable, and fought with my mother because of it. Eventually, I had to be considered ""disabled"" at school, because I would sleep and be unable to wake due to being so low energy.

Some of my family members are vegetarian, and when I was elementary-middle school age, I started eating that way too because of the peer pressure and guilt. At that time I was on meds that made me gain weight, and my one of my family members told one of my parents I need to eat less. Despite the fact I ate the same thing nearly everyday for \~6 years through middle and high school, and I did NOT have an overeating problem literally EVER! I just had water weight from my meds. I would have a coffee for breakfast, skip lunch, chips and salsa and/or protein bar and pb for after school snack, and whatever is made for dinner. After my family got onto me for ""overeating"" (literally water weight from the meds THEY put me on that I didn't even want to take), I began eating less at home too (the only place I really ate).

I have a lot of siblings, there was a lot of competition for food, sometimes I would be force fed food my sisters liked if I ate some until I did not want to eat that food anymore, because my sisters were jealous of me eating their favorite snacks. My oldest siblings were very competitive, but even after I was no longer the youngest, I was now being asked to eat less for my little siblings!

I don't want to be thin, I don't have anorexia, but I can. not. eat. I think it has to do a lot with my negligent upbringing, and having a lot of psychological barriers around food, but it feels so fucking physical. I cannot eat. I haven't ate in 3 days, and I tried eating cheese grits today and immediately threw it ALL up. It's because my hunger is so high, but I have 0 appetite. I don't want to eat ANYTHING. Nothing sounds good, it all sounds like a fucking obligation, rather than a simple pleasure I should be able to enjoy. It's like, now my physical body cannot take any kind of food, because I don't have any ""comfort"" food. The closest thing I have to comfort food is fast food, because I don't have to cook it with the little energy I do have being malnourished, and it packs a lot of calories and the salt perks me up.

It's messing up my life. Even if I use my willpower to eat anything in my sight sometimes, I WILL throw it up if I am too hungry and without an appetite. Nothing is ever appealing to me, and when I tried several meds none of them increase my appetite.

I genuinely don't know how to live like this. I am eating slowly on some cereal with milk in a second attempt to eat without throwing up today, but I already feel sick. Yesterday I tried to eat, and I got sick too. This happens from time to time. I am not sick, I work from home and have not went out recently.

Idk if this has to do with longtime malnourishment, but I cannot drink alcohol or eat added sugar without getting very sick. Very example, I had a small bite of my sisters very sugary ice cream one day, and immediately threw up, had a migraine, was nauseous, etc. within minutes.  That was not the first or last time sugar or alcohol has made me very sick instantaneous.  I just dk how to live like this. I am so weak, tired, sad, antisocial, because I am so hungry and I can't just simply eat.

This has been happening to years, and I have publicly fainted several times due to this, throughout my ENTIRE life.

A lot of food is just gross to me, and I am wasting away.

Maybe it is my PTSD too. I am constantly feeling overwhelmed and ready for battle, and the only calm I get is at the end of the day when I crash for sleep because I physically cannot keep going. This weekend I slept 16 and 17 hours both days too, because I have NO energy!!! I think because I feel so unsafe, it makes it hard to eat, but I had the PTSD meds I have tried before.

When I stopped taking my antidepressant meds, I dropped 30 lbs in 2-3 months and am am now 110-115 lbs.

Idk, this is a very messy post, mainly because I am at such a loss. Some days food tastes like nothing, other days food tastes so strong that it makes me sick. I have my cereal with coconut milk right now, literally Grape Nuts cereal, and the coconut taste from the milk is making me sick now because it's so strong, where I normally never taste it. There is NO WAY I am pregnant. I don't even feel an appetite, like, a ""priming"" for food where you salivate, get kinda excited, stomach rumbles, nothing. When I say I feel hunger, I mean more like that feeling if you don't eat in 30 minutes you will faint, even though by that point I am already too weak, shaky, and cannot stand, literally gripping my kitchen counters to put something in the microwave. Sometimes I will even lay face down on the floor while I wait for my food to be done. Hunger is never this gentle, loving reminder that I must nourish myself, it's this huge dramatic ordeal and I cannot keep living my days like these.

Can my doctor maybe prescribe me weight gain drinks so I don't have to shell out $10 on a case of 4-6?",1,1764006347.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**I just wrote and posted this exact blog post you’re reading now.**

Writers like me want to see our work go viral, and we’re happy to share it with an audience. However, if I published this post only to find it copied and spread around the world without credit to my authorship, I’d be upset.

Or, if someone copied my words, replaced my name with theirs, and passed my blog off as their own, I’d be frustrated. Even worse, if someone audaciously sued me after stealing my work and publishing it as their own — well, I’d counter-sue. By posting my work online, I’m automatically granted copyright and can decide whether to allow others to copy and reuse it.

# What Should Writers and Artists Do About AI?

What about comic illustrators, cartoon animators, painters, and filmmakers? Should we ban AI forever? Yeah, right. Should some random guy in Cincinnati sue Big Tech for scanning his latest social media pictures? That’s debatable. These datasets are massive, and it would be nearly impossible for Jim to prove that any AI-generated image directly used his content. The “black box” effect of neural networks makes it difficult to trace sources. Even if he succeeded, the payout — based on current stock photo prices — would likely be mere fractions of a cent per use.



**Aside: Is Writing the Hardest Art Form?** Some argue that playing a musical instrument is the hardest artistic skill to master.

I’ve always wished I could *draw* better. As a kid, I admired my favorite Marvel Masterpiece trading cards and comics, practicing by sketching the characters. My brother, on the other hand, could invent and draw his own original characters — it was amazing to watch. I managed a few decent copies, but when it came time to create my own superhero… let’s just say “Dogman” looked better in my head than on paper.  


Drawing freehand is hard. Painting is incredibly difficult. Creating a new artistic style? That’s immensely challenging — despite the jokes some in the general public make about artists like Jackson Pollock. From Da Vinci to Picasso to the French Impressionists, every generation of artists, including paint-makers and technologists, has redefined what’s possible.

Imagine living in 1920 and seeing Walt Disney sketch a cartoon rabbit. You’d probably think it was cool — I know I would have. Of course, Walt’s first character was Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, not Mickey Mouse. And Walt only switched to a mouse after a legal dispute over Oswald’s rights. Does that mean Disney was just copying others’ greatness? Certainly not. But respecting prior works and adhering to copyright laws is essential.



# Copyright, AI, and Fair Compensation

Today, some argue that Disney goes too far in protecting its intellectual property, keeping beloved childhood characters locked away. Others believe Web3 will change this practice, but I’m skeptical it would improve television. If X-rated Disney Princess movies were suddenly available to kids, would that be “free speech” or a travesty? There needs to be **regulation** in media, and the advent of AI doesn’t change that. Disney gets to protect their characters in mainstream media, and it seems to work — we all seem to benefit. We can each invent new fun characters, and we should each benefit from our own original creations.

That said, should artists be compensated when their work is included in AI training datasets? Tracking and verifying what data goes into an AI model is feasible. In the music industry, buying an artist’s “masters” gives exclusive profit rights. What if AI datasets worked similarly? Artists could choose whether to include their work in training sets under a structured agreement — similar to how musicians opt into platforms like Spotify or Apple Music. If an AI-driven product becomes successful, contributing artists could receive substantial compensation. The industry could experiment with different payment models, such as one-time fees or revenue-sharing percentages with collective artist contracts to scale and include the long tail of creators. There are new and growing data sets created regularly by new startups and companies. In the future there could be thousands of AI training datasets and apps? Think about the explosion of growth and compensation generated for the humans who created the work they are all trained on, as they print money with AI integrated in businesses all over the world for the rest of time.

However, paying per AI-generated output based on training data is impractical due to the “black box” nature of neural networks. Fortunately, legal and business experts (like [Schuyler Moore](https://www.forbes.com/sites/schuylermoore/2022/10/28/who-owns-voice-and-image-artificial-intelligence-rights)) have spent decades working on these issues. I believe a fair solution will emerge. If human artists stopped creating altogether, AI models would quickly stagnate — no new human works means AI would be stuck recycling old data or generating synthetic data at a scale no one humans could verify for artistic quality.

If we build datasets using only Public Domain content (like images) and then pay a dividend to people who opt in and contribute more images, the cost will end up higher and this app might need to charge consumers more to generate images. But, like “ethically-sourced” coffee beans, customers might pay a small premium because they know and trust the creators weren’t exploited.

These **ethically-sourced training sets** and models could even make it onto an “approved” list by Hollywood guilds, so productions would only use ethically-sourced generated content and those image-generation apps — especially overseas with lax IP protection enforcement and guild regulation of the entertainment industry — could be squeezed out if no one is allowed to use them in Hollywood or those that work with them. Hollywood’s Guilds are powerful and they could team up — and work with the Big 5 Studios — to sway governmental bodies and create new regulation to overpower the individual Big Tech firms.

Of course, AI could also evolve beyond human input, like [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero) mastering chess through reinforcement learning instead of studying human games. A “virgin” AI Artist Bot could push artistic boundaries, forcing human artists to strive and further reach new heights. If that happens, true originality might once again define the human artist’s role. The “democratization” of art would return to the artist, as the pendulum swings. Human artists drawing original characters like Walt Disney did.



# The Role of Market Forces on AI Business Models

Aside: I still love physical books. I buy used books from Amazon, and while the author doesn’t profit from my purchase, the original buyer did. Seems fair. But if I write a book, do I owe a portion of my earnings to every author I’ve ever read? That would be absurd — unless blockchain-based Solidity smart contracts somehow made it possible (if they even *should*). Business models should evolve naturally based on market demand.

The other day, I passed a beautiful **statue** in San Francisco outside the baseball stadium. I’m sure the artist was paid well — after all, it’s a major city with limited spots reserved for public art. Artists in other disciplines get paid differently. A sculptor who creates a statue for a city is compensated up front. Could you imagine charging a fee for every pedestrian who walks past a public statue? Of course not. Public art exists to be shared, but that doesn’t mean artists should give their ideas away for free. They built a reputation over a career, eventually earning the honor of a public commission — maybe through a city grant, but still chosen out of many, which takes years of work to achieve.  


# Finding a Middle Ground

A global ban on training AI with human-created works would likely reduce the quality of AI-generated content, causing it’s creativity to plateau at a “local maximum” and limiting it’s evolution (to use a *Machine Learning* term — see **References** below explaining how it works). I hope we can reach a fair compromise. Future AI-generated art might be extraordinary. The combination of human artists and AI tools could raise artistic standards and create new revenue streams for creators.

Some artists will opt out of AI altogether, preferring to keep their work private. That’s their choice, and they should have the right to remove their content from AI datasets. As market forces adjust, AI companies will likely develop leaner datasets to avoid legal and financial risks. Eventually, a balanced compensation model will emerge, ensuring that both artists and AI developers profit fairly.  


# Final Thoughts

The brewing legal battle between technologists and creators will likely come to a head soon. Will the world settle on an opt-in or opt-out approach? Will government regulations enforce fair practices?

Some artists will fight to keep their work out of AI training sets, just as movie studios fought against piracy in the VHS and Napster eras. Some may even succeed — keeping their work private and accessible only to select audiences and learning artists.

As for me, I’m happy for my blog posts to be freely available, both to human readers and to the robots of the future. But if no one knew I had written these thoughts — if my words were read yet uncredited — I’d be upset, too.

**Afterword from Russell:**

***Machines Learning,*** **and** ***Humans Learning*** *- ""Steven Spielberg grew up watching countless movies — then made his own and, wow, built a fortune. You can bet he paid for every ticket. That’s not a* tax*; it’s just how the system works. The filmmakers he admired also thrived in Hollywood and rightly so.*

*Machine learning is a bit like human learning — except it will live forever. These models can, in theory, watch every film ever made, forever. They have perfect memory, and their neural networks (loosely like our brains) don’t tire or fade. A computer built in the next 20 years could last a billion years, as* [*Isaac Asimov*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) *imagined back in the 1950s.*

*Pulling a single image out of a dataset of billions won’t change much. Even removing one artist’s full catalog probably won’t matter for 99.9% of creators — except maybe for the rare Picassos, Spielbergs, or Beethovens. So yes, you can opt out of AI datasets — like Neil Young pulling his music from Spotify — but who’s really better off? The art just gets locked away to make a point.*

*I believe including the world’s public artistic data — carefully and intentionally — will ultimately benefit both AI and humanity, while still respecting the artistry behind each work."" - R.S.A.P.* 🤖🎥",1,1764006331.0,WriteOnSaga,0,1.0,False

For context - I (41f) have (11f) and (9m). I left in 2017 after 5 years, when our daughter was 2.5 and son 11 months. We were living in Scotland where their dad (44m) is from (he isolated me), I moved back to my hometown in southern England to be close to friends and family for support, and for my mental health. I have brought my kids up alone and they are bright, well-rounded, and want for nothing, even though I am very limited financially. He pays nothing. 


Their father is a narc sociopath, typical back story of love bombing, married him quickly, then his mask came off. Lots of emotional and mental abuse, financial abuse, occasional physical abuse. He is highly intelligent and manipulative and always manages to back me into a corner and make me look bad, but come out golden himself. I don’t know how he does it. 


He quit work (good job as a manager) when I got pregnant with our daughter, hasn’t contributed a penny since. CMS can’t do anything as he has purposely gone into rent arrears so he doesn’t have to pay ‘me’. (Rent arrears are taken from his benefits over maintenance). My own promising career stalled, and I have been in various part time jobs that work around the kids ever since. Stuck in the benefits system. I have always worked as much as possible, because I want to model that for my kids, rather than his lazy entitledness. 


He took me to court in 2018, dragged my name through the mud, tried to throw all sorts of shit at me to see what stuck. Judge didn’t consider my abuse claims, as he was accusing me of the same. Order is barely worth the paper it’s written on, just states that he needed to hand over their passports to me at the time, I am the primary parent, and visits are to take place in school holidays due to the distance.


My issue is, the drop off point is stated in black and white on the order. It’s halfway up the country, a 250 mile drive for both parties, both ways. And a very long trip for the kids. I have made this work for 9 years. I take days off work to drive them up, to pick them up, £££ on petrol, wear and tear on my car, coffees and snacks for the journey etc. It’s gruelling and traumatic. 


All I want is to get that line, with the drop off point, removed from the court order, so the onus is on him to visit/collect his kids, rather than me having to facilitate the huge ordeal. 


It also makes me highly anxious. I am not an anxious person but there is a build up and come down for me and the kids around the visits. I have fought for a PTSD diagnosis for years, finally have one, and finally persuaded doctors to write me a recommendation for legal aid - you have to ‘prove’ the abuse to receive it in England. In Scotland he will receive legal aid easily as on benefits. I *could* beg/steal/borrow money for a solicitor, but this plays in to the financial abuse. I have always paid for EVERYTHING - the wedding, divorce, cars, bills, food, rent, everything!! And it makes me feel like shit to spend more hard-earned money on his nonsense. I need the validation from doctors and government that holds him accountable. For my sanity. 


A few years ago, he lost his driving licence. I don’t speak to him much at all, and he would never give me a straight answer as to why, but I highly suspect it’s to do with the amount of opioid painkillers he’s on. A doctor can revoke a licence for this. He claims depression, broken shoulder, crohn’s disease (all his own doing, getting in fights and terrible diet). He milks and manipulates doctors to gain sympathy and painkillers. I can’t prove this, or any of the abuse really. He is far too gaslighting, clever and sneaky to leave evidence. Therefore, his elderly parents, or scapegoated sister, has been doing drop offs/pick ups for him. I feel terrible for them having to do it. But also relieved he is not driving the kids around any more with no seatbelts, sharing a car seat, sitting in the back of a van, and/or having major roadrage and driving recklessly (daughter is traumatised by him being ‘on 2 wheels’ once when travelling). 


He has visited only 3 or 4 times in 9 years, the last visit being early 2020. He forgets their birthdays. He bad mouths me and my family to the kids when he has them. He encourages bad and cruel behaviour. He does no actual parenting, leaves everything up to his mum on visits. 


My daughter no longer wants to visit, and I’m not going to force her, she gets very upset, she has seen right through him. Therefore I am in contempt of court for her not going. My son has rose-tinted glasses and somewhat idolises his dad. Wants to visit more often, and for longer. He is aware (age-appropriately) that his dad could do more, pay more, and more trips aren’t viable unless his dad facilitates. I never bad mouth him, but I am honest when I need to be. 


The Christmas visit is looming, and I would love to say that due to my work rota, I cannot drop off or pick up the kids. This is partly true as my schedule at xmas is hectic, and I also need to do the journey twice in a week (aswell as a separate family visit up north), when the motorways are like car parks that time of year. My car has overheated before doing it, and has also warned me I’ve been driving too long (12 hours straight one time). It is unsafe. I know I will cave and take/pick up to save his parents or sister doing it, but I hate being manipulated into this, so much. 


So… do I… 


A) use my legal aid, start proceedings and drag us through court with very little evidence? Cafcass will interview the kids. Daughter understands what she will have to do and is quite up for it! Son will defend his dad. BUT this runs a real risk of a judge stating we carry on as we are - which would be a waste of time, effort and money. It will also be traumatic for me and the kids. I do however now have my PTSD diagnosis which might support me evidence wise. 


B) sit tight and wait for him to take me to court for contempt and breaking the agreement by daughter not going? Or for not taking them up at xmas? BUT this way it is always hanging over my head and making me anxious. 


C) Do I float the idea of not being able to drive them up over xmas? Start there and see what the reaction/comeback is? It’s so risky. Or do I break my neck with arrangements as usual? 


Thanks for reading.


TLDR: I am so tired of driving hundreds of miles to facilitate contact with narc ex. Do I go back to court or not?

Another week another review. This week I am back with Dunu again. Well, I was blessed with another Dunu iem specifically Dunu Vulkan2. This is interesting iem. It is a hybrid & open back faceplate. So, me being curious person agreed to review it. Here we are at it.

First of all, thank you to SushiFi and Dunu for making this review possible. Without their help this review wouldn’t have been possible.

All opinions and thoughts are mine. I have not been paid or offered any compensation for the review.

Please keep in mind my bias towards DD sets. My preferences are DD>Hybrids>Planars. Also, my music choices. Please refer to my music genre section.

Now that all pleasantries have been done with Let’s get to meat and potatoes of review.

Build Quality:

What you get in the box

1 pair of iems

1 modular cable with 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm terminations

4 pairs of Dunu S & S ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu Candy ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu standard tips

1 cleaning tool

1 cleaning cloth

1 pair iem booties

1 Carrying case

As you can see Dunu has been generous towards included accessories. Dunu never disappoints in this department. Totally premium package.

Iem shells are made of cnc machined aerospace grade aluminium. They feel solid in hand. Faceplate has slats with mesh covering them. This is where it being open back stems from. Shells are medium size. Nozzles are also metal. Nozzles have lip on them. This helps gripping ear tips well. No risk of ear tips slipping off here. Nozzle length is adequate and provide deep insertion.

Stock cable is premium one, it is thick and multi core. The cable separator and terminations are made up of metal. Cable is modular and comes with Dunu Q lock system. It has 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm terminations which are swappable. Stock cable that came with this unit is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Dunu offers mmcx and 2 pin type both in cable and iem.

Sheer number of ear tips included makes it very easy to settle on most comfortable ear tip. You can see the number and variety of ear tips just go few lines up. These are premium ear tips.

Iem booties are great inclusion. There is cleaning cloth & tool also included. Provided case is leather or faux leather can’t comment. But the case is sturdy and hard. It will be useful to protect iems.

Comfort & Fit:

Shells being made up of metal don’t weight too much you can call them light. There is no soreness or discomfort felt during my extended listening. Shells are medium sized, yet I will ask people to do

demo before purchase.

Cable is not microphonic so no disturbance while listening to music. Ear hooks on the cable don’t tug on the iems.

Passive noise isolation is there. You can easily block outside noises up to 60% loud noises will still get in. As the shells have open back design, I don’t know how its providing good isolation. But isolation works.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5

&#x200B;

Configuration:

2 DD + 6BA combination hybrid Iem. One 10mm DD + One 8mm DD, Unknown Knowles BAs. Advanced 4-way crossover with both physical and electronic one. Impedance, sensitivity & frequency range are unknown.

Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

6.Onix alpha xi 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient as when i used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7 > Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.

&#x200B;

Ear tips:

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips

best pairing that I found was with Dunu S & S ear tips for me.

Sound Impressions:

Bass / Lows:

Sub bass here is fast and quick type. It rumbles but not to point where you can feel it. You can hear it. Sub bass is less compared to mid bass. Mid bass here is good quality type. You can feel it. It is also quick and fast decay kind. Here the tuning is mid bass over sub bass. Bass is not for bass head lovers. This is neutral and treble head level bass.

Drums kick drums sound bit anaemic as the reverberations are missing. Bass guitars the string reverberations are also not up to the point.

I personally think this is the weakest point of this set.

Overall Bass/Lows 3.5/5

Mids:

Mids are forward here. Vocals sound front centre. You can heart singer taking gulps of air. Male vocals are good but Female vocals shine here. Sibilance is present. “ch“ “t” “s” sound pronounced.

Instruments in Mids sound clear. String instruments sound good. There is clarity in instruments due to tuning choice.

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble / Highs:

Treble here is tuned well. There are enough macro & micro details. You will not miss any details.

Soundstage is wide and has average height. Yet this is not the widest set I have had pleasure to review. Layering and separation is good. There is no congestion or smearing. Positional queue are correct and on point. Holographic stage.

Treble here can become bit too much for people who are sensitive to treble.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5

Song Impressions:

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

This song is to check for vocals, layering & separation. Starting piano piece sounds great. Drum sticks and strike on their surface feel dull. Both Male & female vocals are great. String instruments are emphatic. Trumpets sound great. No smearing. All instruments are well separate.

Overall good quality reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack.

Bass check song for me. Here the entire song has subbass droning which you can hear and feel at the same time. This is lacking here. Vocals are good. Sub bass and mid bass are soul of this song, and they are anaemic here. So entire song feels bit let down.

Ego Death by Polyphia

This song is check for soundstage, layering, speed of drivers & separation. Here the lack of bass impact affects drums and guitar notes. They fell bit dull. Instruments are well separated and don’t smear each other. Song doesn’t get harsh or shrill. Which it can depending on tuning.

Overall acceptable reproduction.

Hotel California by Eagles

This is iconic song every audiophile knows. So using this song to check overall representation of it. Guitars which are usp of this song are well represented. Drums are not up to the mark. You can make out all the twinkies & sparkles in the song. Vocals are as they should be. Reproduction is good in terms of guitars, but the bass impact is missing. That makes this song more enjoyable. No harshness or shrillness was encountered.

Overall adequate reproduction.

Final Conclusion:

Dunu knows how to make great sets. Look at single DD sets they are all legends in their respective price brackets. Yet when it comes to hybrids. They have been bit hit & miss. SA6 was massive hit & remains as legend. So, I had high regard that this set might be next best hybrid from Dunu.

Here in Vulkan2 it has the technical prowess that Dunu is well known for. Vocals are excellent. Soundstage feel wide and tall. Yet all this is negated by lack of bass impact in the tuning. It makes the tuning incomplete for me. I feel if Dunu had provided bass like their DD sets, this would have been one of the best releases from them in hybrid sets.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not negating anything done right here by Dunu. If you are detail chaser and stage hound this set will please you. For Mid Fi set this has lot of things right. Just Bass heads this is not for you.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of hot coffee and kick your legs up, start jamming to music you love. See you soon in another review.

The next day, I signed up for my first lesson (https://longreefgolfclub.com.au/). A group of six beginners, the instructor was a guy in his 60s, a former tour pro. Straight to the range: he demonstrated the ""birdie-like"" grip, then 30 minutes of greenside chipping and 20 minutes of putting. All with humor, no shouting, in flip-flops and a T-shirt. At the end, he gave everyone 10 balls on the driving range and said, ""Hit until you get bored."" I hit 150 balls and realized I was screwed.

We went to grab coffee at my local shop . he does this thing a lot where if he see's something that he morally /ethically disagrees with he says something even when it not his place or pertains to him.  Low key , it kind of cute that he sticks up for other people or tell them as it is ,but maybe that wrong of me to think.  So basically we were in the shop and he noticed the line of cars in drive thru. One of them ( who he knew) cut in front of this car and also was not parked behind the drive thru line or something illegal. He went outside to tell them off and called them ""retard"" he done this before and is aware upsets me. The person who got cut said something to him and tthen another car said they were planning on cutting him off. We went back inside and ask if i was upset and i explained and proceeded to explain how he was ""good"" and was done with the convo. It a common thing fot him to do. He likes to move past things and i like talking it out. I told him it is gaslighting bc he makes me feel bad. He said the car situation will not happen again ,but it does. He said he was joking about punching person in car and how since i was standing outsidr with him he held himself back.  He just wanted move past it and idk why i feel sad today... i told him it not worth it bc he get nothing out of it and what if they had weapon in car etc. He said the what if r just scernerios did not happen.

1p5nmr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1p5nmr0/looking_for_love_is_a_deep_scar/,Looking for Love is a Deep Scar,"A week before her wedding, Adeline Falcone received an anonymous email.

The moment she clicked the link, the explicit images on the screen made her forget how to breathe.

The link led to a dark website called ""The Beast's Lair,"" filled with graphic videos of men and women. The performers all wore animal masks, their bodies tangled wildly against a stark black background. The scale of it was shocking.

She frantically closed the page, but the afterimage burned into her mind.

In the top trending video, the man in the fox mask—his jawline, his build, even his heavy breathing—was identical to her fiancé, Vincent Costello.

The conference room fell silent. The faces of the other family ""capos"" were grim.

""Adeline, are you alright?""

Adeline forced herself to breathe, managing a weak smile as she continued her report on the family's ""legitimate"" businesses.

But inside, doubt and unease were growing like weeds.

After the meeting, she made an excuse and drove straight home.

Opening the link again, she clutched her three-month pregnant belly and dialed Vincent’s number with a trembling hand.

In the live stream from ""The Beast's Lair,"" a familiar ringtone suddenly sounded.

The man in the fox mask glanced at the screen, tossed the phone aside, and moved with even more force, drawing a series of moans from his partner in the rabbit mask.

The live show lasted for four excruciating hours.

Adeline watched the entire thing, too numb to even stand up.

But when the camera panned across the man's lower abdomen, a wave of relief washed over her.

There was no scar. It wasn't Vincent. She would never mistake the scar on Vincent's body.

A moment later, she heard a key in the front door. Vincent walked in.

His face was stern, his custom-tailored suit perfectly crisp, as if he belonged to a different world than the frenzied man in the video.

Vincent walked over and smiled gently at her.

""Sorry, my love. The meeting with the old-timers ran long, and I didn't get a chance to check my phone. Did you need something?""

Feeling guilty, Adeline quickly shut her laptop. ""Nothing, I just wanted to know when you'd be home.""

She kept telling herself it wasn't Vincent. Vincent loved her too much to ever betray her.

Years ago, she was hit by a stray bullet during a family feud, causing her kidneys to fail. Without telling anyone, he secretly got tested, found he was a match, and gave her one of his kidneys. The first thing he said waking up from the anesthesia was, ""Adeline, I just need you to live. That's enough.""

That's where the scar came from. It was proof of his love, a love he had risked his life for.

Besides, Vincent was known in the family for being cold and disciplined.

The last cocktail waitress who tried to seduce him, who had only brushed her chest against his arm, was ordered to be ""handled"" and thrown into the Hudson River. Afterwards, he scrubbed his arm with rubbing alcohol for an entire hour.

Even when Adeline was being clingy, he would gently push her away. ""My little kitten, don't be so needy. It clouds my judgment.""

He hated the touch of any woman but her. How could a man like that be so wild with a stranger?

""Adeline, what are you thinking about?""

Vincent handed her a glass of milk, his bathrobe hanging open to reveal a powerful chest.

Thinking about the images from today, the anxiety crept back in.

The mattress dipped beside her as Vincent wrapped his arms around her from behind. ""Get some sleep. It's good for our baby.""

Adeline turned over, her hand gently tracing the skin of his lower stomach. The familiar scar was still there. The knot of fear in her chest finally loosened.

Vincent kissed her forehead. ""Why are you always touching my scar? You think it's ugly?""

""No,"" Adeline whispered, snuggling into his arms. ""Vincent, I love you.""

He paused for a second, then chuckled softly, holding her tighter. ""I love you too, Adeline. Only you.""

""Just seven more days, and you'll be the matriarch of the Costello family. Rest up, and be the most beautiful bride in that dress.""

Adeline closed her eyes with a smile.

Maybe the man in the video was just a coincidence. Maybe she was just being paranoid because of the pregnancy.

But in the middle of the night, she woke with a start. The space beside her was empty.

Vincent's shoes were gone from the entryway. He had left.

Her heart pounded in her chest as she scrambled to the computer.

The fox-masked man was streaming again. It was the same woman in the rabbit mask, the two of them tangled together in a passionate embrace.

Even with the mask, the excitement and wildness in the fox's eyes were unmistakable.

They moved through every position imaginable until they were both spent.

She stared intently at the man's stomach.

This time, under the harsh light, the scar was perfectly, horribly clear.

In this video, the woman's voice was distorted by a modulator as she cooed, ""I hate this scar you got for another woman. And you won't even get it lasered off. I have to cover it with concealer for you every time.""

The fox man chuckled, leaning down to kiss her lips. ""I gave you the villa in the West Suburbs. Isn't that enough?""

""Not enough,"" the rabbit woman purred. ""Not unless you promise me we'll do it again in seven days. At your wedding. I'm the maid of honor, after all. No one will ever suspect a thing.""

The fox man was silent for a moment.

The rabbit woman whimpered, and just as she tried to pull away, he grabbed her waist, his movements becoming rougher.

""Fine. Anything you want.""

2、
Adeline felt like she had been plunged into ice water.

The villa in the West Suburbs was Vincent's wedding gift to her, their future home.

And Adeline’s only maid of honor was none other than the woman she trusted with her life, her best friend—Isabella ""Bella"" Rossi.

Bella was the first light in her life. When Adeline’s parents were killed in a family conflict, she was left alone, hiding in a church corner, gnawing on stale bread. It was Bella who dragged her home, who always saved the last piece of meat on her plate for her.

When the neighborhood bullies chased her with a pellet gun, it was Bella who threw up her arm to block the pellet aimed at her eye, getting hurt in the process.

So she trusted Bella more than anyone. They were as close as sisters.

After she met Vincent, Bella had even warned him, ""Adeline is like my own sister. You have to treat her right, or I'll never forgive you. The power of the Costello family doesn't scare me!""

Vincent had shot back, ""Adeline is the love of my life. From now on, please stay away from her. Don't be a bad influence.""

They were always at each other's throats. If Adeline hadn't been there to stop them, they would have pulled guns on each other long ago.

Back then, Adeline felt so lucky. Her best friend and the man she loved both cared about her so deeply.

Now, the video of them together was like a slap across the face.

No wonder Bella was always so vague about her boyfriend, never letting Adeline meet him.

It turned out they shared one.

All the clues clicked into place, forming a suffocating net around her, making it hard to even breathe.

A gasp from the screen broke her trance. The rabbit woman trembled in the fox man's arms before kissing him deeply.

The chat in the livestream exploded with comments.

[Fox is a fucking beast. Second round tonight and still going this hard.]

[Remember when that deer mask chick tried to kiss him and he dodged? I thought he was a germaphobe, but I guess he makes an exception for Rabbit.]

[My favorite couple! Please keep going, this is amazing.]

Adeline slumped in her chair, her heart feeling like it was being sliced apart.

Trembling, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number in Italy.

""About starting a new family business in Europe… I'm in. I'll be there in seven days.""

After hanging up, she contacted a private investigator, an old family loyalist who had worked for her father.

Two hours later, Vincent returned, bringing a chill with him.

He quickly showered, acting as if nothing had happened, then made breakfast and gave Adeline a good-morning kiss.

Adeline couldn't understand why Vincent would betray her with her best friend. They were supposed to hate each other.

After Vincent left, Adeline called Bella.

""Honey, I took the day off just for you. You have no idea what a nightmare your stone-faced fiancé is at work. One tiny mistake and he'll chew you out for an hour! Thank God you gave me an excuse to escape.""

Bella linked arms with her, complaining about how much Vincent overworked her in the family business.

Adeline smelled her perfume; it was the same one Vincent wore. Her fingertips went cold, but she forced herself to sound calm. ""I think Vincent is seeing someone else.""

Bella’s shocked expression didn't seem fake.

""No way! You must be overthinking things because of the pregnancy. Vincent loves you so much. He would never cheat.""

Adeline didn't say anything else, just watched Bella's eyes carefully.

When they ordered drinks, Adeline got Bella her usual: soda water with ice.

""I can't have ice anymore,"" Bella said softly, rubbing her stomach. ""I'm pregnant.""

3、
Her words hit Adeline like a bolt of lightning. ""You're pregnant?""

Bella looked at her, pretending to be shy. ""It was an accident. I'm three months along, too.""

Three months. Her baby was also three months. Bella had gotten pregnant at the same time as her.

""Is the father your boyfriend? I've never even met this new guy.""

With every word, Adeline’s heart trembled a little more.

""Yeah, he's always busy,"" Bella said with a smile, picking up her phone. ""But that's okay. He can't always be with me, but when we do see each other, it’s like he’s trying to devour me to make up for it. I should be happy with that.""

Vincent called, asking where Adeline was, and said he was coming to pick her up.

When he arrived, his face darkened the moment he saw Bella.

""You said you had something urgent to take care of. You meant getting coffee?""

Before Bella could speak, Adeline cut in. ""I asked Bella to go shopping with me. Let's drop her home first.""

""Oh, no, I don't want to be a third wheel,"" Bella said, holding her lower back. ""I'll just get a cab.""

She quickly hailed a taxi and got in before Vincent could say anything.

Adeline noticed Vincent's knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel.

He drove slowly, keeping a careful distance behind Bella's cab, as if afraid something would happen to her.

At the next intersection, the taxi driver slammed on his brakes, and Bella seemed to be jolted in the back seat.

Vincent stomped on the brake. The sudden stop threw Adeline forward, the seatbelt cutting painfully into her.

But Vincent didn't even notice her discomfort. He unbuckled his seatbelt and ran towards the taxi.

He knocked on the window, his voice tight with anger.

""Are you insane? I told you not to run around while you're pregnant! Get in my car, now!""

""What's it to you?"" Bella's eyes turned red, her voice cracking. ""You should be taking Adeline home! Leave me alone!""

Vincent clicked his tongue, then simply opened the back door, leaned in, and swept Bella into his arms, carrying her to his car and placing her gently in the back seat.

Only after Bella was settled did he turn to look at Adeline in the passenger seat.

Her face was pale, her lips colorless. She was clutching her cramping stomach, sweat beading on her forehead.

A flicker of panic finally crossed Vincent's eyes. He grabbed her arm. ""Sorry, my love, did I scare you? She's your best friend. I was afraid you'd rush out to help her and hurt yourself, that's why I…""

Bella quickly added, ""I'm so sorry, Adeline. It's all my fault for worrying you.""

Watching them, Adeline felt a bitter irony.

They clearly cared so much for each other, yet they had to pretend it was all for her sake.

She closed her eyes, protecting her small baby bump. ""It's fine. Just take her home.""

Vincent was obviously distracted while driving, his expression growing heavier.

After dropping Bella off, he seemed to relax and drove Adeline home.

They didn't speak a word. Back at their house, Vincent hugged her from behind.

""Adeline, are you still mad at me? I'm sorry, I was just worried. You said she's the only family you have left. I was scared she would get hurt and you'd be upset. It was just an impulse.""

Adeline's chest felt like it had been hit with a sledgehammer, a dull, aching pain.

He had clearly seen how uncomfortable the sudden stop had made her, yet his eyes kept flicking to Bella in the rearview mirror.

It was so obvious who he cared about more.

""Vincent, let's call…""

Before she could say the words ""call off the wedding,"" Vincent's phone rang. His face changed instantly.

""My love, something urgent came up with the family. I have to go handle it. Wait for me at home!""

He bolted out the door. Adeline's heart clenched. She went to the study and pulled up the security feed for the West Suburbs villa.

Of course. He had gone to Bella. As soon as he was inside, his voice was filled with concern. ""Is your stomach hurting? Let me see. Was it from the car ride?""

He held Bella tenderly, rubbing her belly. Bella leaned into him and whispered, ""You were so obvious today. Do you think Adeline suspects anything?""

Instantly, Vincent's face turned cold, and he put some distance between them. ""She won't find out. And you are not to see her alone again!""

""Why not? Adeline is my best friend. Are you saying I can't see her just because of you?""

""She's pregnant!"" Vincent hissed. ""I can't have you saying the wrong thing and stressing her out.""

""But I'm pregnant too!"" Bella's voice was tearful. ""Doesn't my baby matter? You knew I was pregnant and you still came to me. Don't you care about my feelings at all?""

The air went still. After a long moment, Vincent spoke in a heavy voice. ""This child's existence was a mistake.""

""Vincent, you bastard!"" Bella cried, hitting him. But a moment later, the sounds of them kissing filled the room, followed by the rustle of clothing.

""Be a good girl. Get rid of the baby. I'll give you enough money to live comfortably for the rest of your life.""

Bella was silent for a second, then wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. ""But I hate procedures. I'd rather you help me take care of it. I heard… if we do it enough times, it'll just go away on its own…""

Vincent cursed under his breath, but still swept her into his arms and slammed the bedroom door shut.

A second later, a text from him popped up on her phone.

[My love, I have to work late at the family office tonight. Get some rest. Love you.]

The words ""Love you"" were in black, but to Adeline, they burned a blood-red.

A wave of nausea washed over her, and she doubled over, dry heaving.

How pathetic. Their secret hookup spot was the very house she was supposed to move into in seven days. Her marital home.

Her heart ached as if it were being torn apart. Adeline felt the cold, salty sting of tears on her face.

Just then, the private investigator sent her a message.

It’s been a weird weekend of feelings. I got into work on Friday night to get pulled into the office by my manager and his boss.

Now normally first thought would be “oh shit, what’ve I done.” Even more so when the boss stays beyond 3/4 pm at work.

Nope. They broke the news to me that my ex who also used to work there passed away. To say it was shocking is an understatement as I didn’t know why she hadn’t been at work for about a year, and on top of that I’d stopped talking to her because my current girlfriend was getting more and more annoyed we were still in contact (last November was when we last spoke.)

For a bit of background we were together for almost 2 years. She, my ex, was 8 years older than me and had two kids ,10 and 14, when we got together. We met at work but I was in a relationship with someone else at the time and we were just colleagues. Fast forward a couple of years I’m single and we seem to be working a lot together so we bonded.

Outside of work we would message about what a crap day it had been at work and jokingly speak about the dread of going in. Eventually we agreed to go for a drink one day and that ended up beginning one of the best periods of my life, although not with its ups and downs.

As time went on she would challenge my sometimes poor behaviour, not cleaning up after myself, just dicking about, stuff like that.

Around this time my mental health deteriorated and she was the one that got me to start seeking help. She was the one who got me my first appointment with my GP to start looking into medication. She was also the one who pushed for me to get into therapy when the medication began to whack me out with the side effects.

With my psoriasis she was amazing. Before I was on medication she would actually soothe my skin with ointments and creams I’d been prescribed and push me to use them even though I had a defeatist mentality. She was there through several key appointments that have led me to be where I am now with my skin.

Eventually my behaviours soured our relationship. My managing my money, my habit to lie when I thought I’d get in trouble, my general disregard for others in my day to day.

She made a decision that it was over because she couldn’t let her priorities for her children be ignored any longer, which now I completely understand.

I was in love with her throughout our relationship and even afterwards I was for a period. Eventually those feelings sort’ve died down, or hid, and we both seemed to move on. We were civil at work but still falling into old habits of banter and expectations with each other with a playful grin. If I was doing a round of teas and coffees, no black cups and a thin lip. That kind of thing.

I was in on her last shift and we just spoke like normal. Even though we’d be split up for nearly a year at that point.

Probably stupidly on my part, when I got with my current girlfriend, we would still be in contact every so often. When my dad was intubated on an ICU ward she was messaging me to see how I was from a general welfare perspective. My girlfriend was annoyed at this so I just cut contact and radio silence. That was last year.

Obviously this has brought up a lot of confusing feelings. Sadness, anger at myself because I’d not spoken to her or really made amends with her after we broke up. It’s affected a few people at work in its own way.

I’m struggling at work with the constant are you okays and how are yous. I don’t feel like I have the right to be as upset as I am because it had been nearly 2 years since we were last sort’ve together.

She has two kids who I spent a lot of time with when we were together who my heart aches for. Do I send them a card of condolence? Do I try and get a message to them? To her family?

My girlfriend who I’m with now, I haven’t really spoken to her the last couple of days because how do I talk to someone that I’m grieving for someone I used to love? I suppose I still do? Not in love but love for the time we had?

But I think because of all this has become threatened somehow. Some of the messages have been awful when we’ve been at work. I’ve just ignored her when she’s got like this because I don’t want to retaliate.

This is all just from Jenna dying. I don’t know if I have the right to feel the way I do. I don’t know if I should go to the funeral, if the family wants anyone at the funeral anyway.",7,1764005960.0,GriefSupport,2,1.0,False

Another week another review. This week I am back with Dunu again. Well, I was blessed with another Dunu iem specifically Dunu Vulkan2. This is interesting iem. It is a hybrid & open back faceplate. So, me being curious person agreed to review it. Here we are at it.

First of all, thank you to SushiFi and Dunu for making this review possible. Without their help this review wouldn’t have been possible.

All opinions and thoughts are mine. I have not been paid or offered any compensation for the review.

Please keep in mind my bias towards DD sets. My preferences are DD>Hybrids>Planars. Also, my music choices. Please refer to my music genre section.

Now that all pleasantries have been done with Let’s get to meat and potatoes of review.

Build Quality:

What you get in the box

1 pair of iems

1 modular cable with 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm terminations

4 pairs of Dunu S & S ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu Candy ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu standard tips

1 cleaning tool

1 cleaning cloth

1 pair iem booties

1 Carrying case

As you can see Dunu has been generous towards included accessories. Dunu never disappoints in this department. Totally premium package.

Iem shells are made of cnc machined aerospace grade aluminium. They feel solid in hand. Faceplate has slats with mesh covering them. This is where it being open back stems from. Shells are medium size. Nozzles are also metal. Nozzles have lip on them. This helps gripping ear tips well. No risk of ear tips slipping off here. Nozzle length is adequate and provide deep insertion.

Stock cable is premium one, it is thick and multi core. The cable separator and terminations are made up of metal. Cable is modular and comes with Dunu Q lock system. It has 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm terminations which are swappable. Stock cable that came with this unit is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Dunu offers mmcx and 2 pin type both in cable and iem.

Sheer number of ear tips included makes it very easy to settle on most comfortable ear tip. You can see the number and variety of ear tips just go few lines up. These are premium ear tips.

Iem booties are great inclusion. There is cleaning cloth & tool also included. Provided case is leather or faux leather can’t comment. But the case is sturdy and hard. It will be useful to protect iems.

Comfort & Fit:

Shells being made up of metal don’t weight too much you can call them light. There is no soreness or discomfort felt during my extended listening. Shells are medium sized, yet I will ask people to do

demo before purchase.

Cable is not microphonic so no disturbance while listening to music. Ear hooks on the cable don’t tug on the iems.

Passive noise isolation is there. You can easily block outside noises up to 60% loud noises will still get in. As the shells have open back design, I don’t know how its providing good isolation. But isolation works.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5

Configuration:

2 DD + 6BA combination hybrid Iem. One 10mm DD + One 8mm DD, Unknown Knowles BAs. Advanced 4-way crossover with both physical and electronic one. Impedance, sensitivity & frequency range are unknown.

Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/test-tracks/pl.u-8aAVXG6ivz8gyxX?ls

Sources:

Sources from basic ones to hi end ones.

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix alpha xi 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient as when i used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7 > Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.

&#x200B;

Ear tips:

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips

best pairing that I found was with Dunu S & S ear tips for me.

Sound Impressions:

Bass / Lows:

Sub bass here is fast and quick type. It rumbles but not to point where you can feel it. You can hear it. Sub bass is less compared to mid bass. Mid bass here is good quality type. You can feel it. It is also quick and fast decay kind. Here the tuning is mid bass over sub bass. Bass is not for bass head lovers. This is neutral and treble head level bass.

Drums kick drums sound bit anaemic as the reverberations are missing. Bass guitars the string reverberations are also not up to the point.

I personally think this is the weakest point of this set.

Overall Bass/Lows 3.5/5

Mids:

Mids are forward here. Vocals sound front centre. You can heart singer taking gulps of air. Male vocals are good but Female vocals shine here. Sibilance is present. “ch“ “t” “s” sound pronounced.

Instruments in Mids sound clear. String instruments sound good. There is clarity in instruments due to tuning choice.

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble / Highs:

Treble here is tuned well. There are enough macro & micro details. You will not miss any details.

Soundstage is wide and has average height. Yet this is not the widest set I have had pleasure to review. Layering and separation is good. There is no congestion or smearing. Positional queue are correct and on point. Holographic stage.

Treble here can become bit too much for people who are sensitive to treble.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5

Song Impressions:

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

This song is to check for vocals, layering & separation. Starting piano piece sounds great. Drum sticks and strike on their surface feel dull. Both Male & female vocals are great. String instruments are emphatic. Trumpets sound great. No smearing. All instruments are well separate.

Overall good quality reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack.

Bass check song for me. Here the entire song has subbass droning which you can hear and feel at the same time. This is lacking here. Vocals are good. Sub bass and mid bass are soul of this song, and they are anaemic here. So entire song feels bit let down.

Ego Death by Polyphia

This song is check for soundstage, layering, speed of drivers & separation. Here the lack of bass impact affects drums and guitar notes. They fell bit dull. Instruments are well separated and don’t smear each other. Song doesn’t get harsh or shrill. Which it can depending on tuning.

Overall acceptable reproduction.

Hotel California by Eagles

This is iconic song every audiophile knows. So using this song to check overall representation of it. Guitars which are usp of this song are well represented. Drums are not up to the mark. You can make out all the twinkies & sparkles in the song. Vocals are as they should be. Reproduction is good in terms of guitars, but the bass impact is missing. That makes this song more enjoyable. No harshness or shrillness was encountered.

Overall adequate reproduction.

Final Conclusion:

Dunu knows how to make great sets. Look at single DD sets they are all legends in their respective price brackets. Yet when it comes to hybrids. They have been bit hit & miss. SA6 was massive hit & remains as legend. So, I had high regard that this set might be next best hybrid from Dunu.

Here in Vulkan2 it has the technical prowess that Dunu is well known for. Vocals are excellent. Soundstage feel wide and tall. Yet all this is negated by lack of bass impact in the tuning. It makes the tuning incomplete for me. I feel if Dunu had provided bass like their DD sets, this would have been one of the best releases from them in hybrid sets.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not negating anything done right here by Dunu. If you are detail chaser and stage hound this set will please you. For Mid Fi set this has lot of things right. Just Bass heads this is not for you.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of hot coffee and kick your legs up, start jamming to music you love. See you soon in another review.

I just wrapped up my Product Hunt launch for my tool, **DesignLumo**, and I wanted to share the raw numbers and the ""ugly"" side of launching in 2024. No guru talk, just what actually happened.

**The Context** I originally planned to launch on a **Tuesday**. I submitted my product, but I realized I wasn't going to get the ""Featured"" spot (which basically means death on PH).

* **The ""Hack"":** I emailed support and actually asked for help. Surprisingly, they gave me the option to postpone to **Sunday**. I took it. If you aren't getting featured, **email them**. It might save your launch.

**The Results (The ""Meh"" Reality)** Here is exactly what a ""Rank 6"" launch on a Sunday gets you:

* **Rank:** \#6 Product of the Day
* **Upvotes:** 191
* **Page Visitors:** \~600
* **Signups:** \~250
* **Paid Customers:** 2
* **Total Revenue:** $26
* **Cost to me:** \~$15-20 USD in GPU costs (I gave away free credits for the AI generation).

**Traffic Split:**

* 37% India
* 13% USA
* 50% Rest of World

**The Hard Truth (The Rant)** The platform feels... broken.

1. **The Pay-to-Win Mafia:** This was the most shocking part. As soon as I went live, my LinkedIn and DMs were flooded. I got **20+ messages** from agencies and individuals offering ""Top Spot Guaranteed"" for money. It’s an open secret now.
2. **Broken Winners:** I looked at the top 5. Some of them were barely functional products. Meanwhile, I saw genuinely incredible devs with working products sitting at rank 15 because they didn't buy upvotes.
3. **Conversion is hard for some category especially if your ICP is not on PH:** Getting 600 visitors is great, but PH traffic is often ""window shoppers"" looking for freebies. Converting them to paid is a totally different beast.

**So, what did I actually build?** Since I already paid for the GPU credits, I might as well tell you what the tool does 😅.

I built **DesignLumo** because I was tired of Midjourney giving me flat images I couldn't edit, and Canva forcing me into rigid templates.

* **The pitch:** You type a prompt (e.g., ""Crate me Facebook ad poster for my coffee shop"").
* **The magic:** It doesn't just generate a JPEG. It generates a **fully editable project**.
* **The result:** You get layers. You can change the text, swap the fonts, move the layout, and change colors inside a canvas editor.

It’s basically **Text-to-Editable-Design**.

**TL;DR:** Product Hunt is full of bots and scammers, Sunday launches are safer but lower traffic.

I don't think it was super popular among other SCP games but it still had enough players to have fun with. I have a memory of this game getting a big revamp and that I stopped playing because it wasn't the same as before. The SCP-173 cover art for the very active Roblox game [*SCP: Roleplay*](https://www.roblox.com/games/5041144419/SCP-Roleplay) looks super familiar to be a part of that memory and for a while I just thought that was the same game I'm thinking of now, but I looked into videos of its earliest builds and it just didn't look quite like how I remember. Either this *is* that same game and my memory is just wrong or maybe that game was deleted so when searched for it afterwards, I mistook *SCP: Roleplay* with being the same one. What really breaks my heart and frustrates me though is how I know for a fact I used to have screenshots on an Xbox account of mine but I foolishly ignored all the messages and posts from Xbox about that whole thing in 2023 where they deleted any captures older than 90 days if you don't back them up. I can still think of multiple memories I had playing that game and I can still remember specific things about that game itself.

Here's a list of those things I can remember that I typed in my notes app:

* Those with the MTF (Mobile Task Force) role would have P90s as the Private rank but higher ranks would have better guns like assault rifles (maybe M16s or M4s?)
* I tried playing as a scientist and I was pretty confused. I'm not sure if there were a lot of things for the scientists to do in that game.
* When I got Lieutenant rank (which I think was the highest at the time but I'm really not sure) as an MTF I can vaguely remember wearing a beret.
* There was an expensive game pass that would let you play as an SCP
* Class-D's who crossed the red line in the cell block would get a ""TERMINATE"" text in red under their names. This memory for me is probably the most vivid and doesn't seem to be the case at all with other SCP games I played while looking for this one.
* I sort of remember what the Chaos Insurgency escape area outside the facility looked like. It was always at nighttime, I think the devs made it snowy in December updates, getting there safely as a D-Class was like an obstacle course with one part having a long wooden plank over a body of water that you had to cross without falling off, I kind of remember having to climb a long way to get to the base, and I'm pretty sure they changed it up a lot, revamping this area at one point.
* The small cafeteria had coffee in two machines with a whole filling animation. You would simply click on the machine to fill it, grab a cup, and then click on it again to fill it with coffee
* I don't think there was a way to get food or any drink other than coffee
* Around Christmas time the coffee was replaced with hot chocolate and in Halloween it was green slime.
* There was just one or two large tables with seats in that cafeteria. I remember this because I know one of those screenshots I lost is of me and several other players sitting at that table with coffee.
* This game didn't use the same textures or designs as the game ""SCP - Containment Breach"" unlike other SCP games on Roblox",1,1764005472.0,tipofmytongue,1,1.0,False

Our DB is moving into the 11th year, and there has been zero sex in 14 months, which is when I just stopped trying to initiate anything altogether. Basically, the DB started with pregnancy, and while there have been a handful (ie, you can count them on one hand) of passionate episodes since then, we've been well below the ""10-12 times a year"" yardstick. This is our longest dry spell. Lots of ups and downs throughout the marriage because of this and a few other things, but mostly this (not purely the lack of sex/intimacy, but the issues that give rise to it). Several stretches of different types of therapy, and a close brush with divorce, and things have been mostly stable now for two years. I would have checked out years ago if not for having a child. Which brings me to the point of this post...

This past weekend my wife and I were in bed ""reading the papers"" (on our phones) and drinking coffee, and the child came in wanting to hang for a few minutes. I gave my wife some non-sexual caresses (shoulder/arm rubbing), and my child said ""why are you petting mom""? I laughed, because my wife frequently says - when I am giving affectionate caresses - ""I don't like you petting me"". This happens even when it really is non-sexual. I then told the child, ""she is my wife, and I love her and I am giving her some affection"".  The kicker was that my wife said ""yeah, he used to do that a lot more, but doesn't as often now \[which is why it seems unusual to you child\]""...to which I replied, ""yeah, that's true, I don't as much anymore because your mom gets mad at me for doing it, but sometimes I forget and do it anyway"". Like, FU wife, you're the reason for this, you're not putting the blame for this on me...particularly because she LITERALLY says ""stop petting me""...she had said that some other morning within the last week (no child present).

This episode made it crystal clear to me what our marriage and relationship look like to our child. They have absorbed that people don't hug/kiss/touch/caress. So...maybe that ""staying together for the kid"" isn't all that great...it is clear what kind of relationship we are modeling.

I am a 32 year old cis woman hoping to find a connection with a cis woman.  If you are not a cis woman and have decided to read this I am more than happy to be friends.  Ideally I’d like someone fairly local.  I think the farthest I’m looking for is about a 1-2 hour drive closer would be better but I do have a car so I can travel a bit at times. Age isn’t a huge factor for me.  My typical preference is 25+ however I’m still open to talking to anyone over the age of 18 however it’s not super likely a romantic connection will form but not impossible. I do not drink or smoke weed and don’t wish to have close connections with people who have a high value of mind altering substances. I am sober, you don’t have to be though.

Obligatory physique I am 5’8”, average build not chubby and not stick thin, brown eyes, brown curly long hair, light skin. I primarily wear men’s clothes but my face and body are very feminine.

A bit about me I would consider myself an ambivert.  I like going out but equally like staying in.  Some activities I like going out consist of restaurants but I’m not at all a foodie, museums, musicals, theatre, movies, live music, comedy, casual hang outs, coffee/tea, drag shows, watching bad karaoke, probably a bunch of other things I haven’t tried yet. At home I enjoy watching tv and playing video games.  In terms of TV I really enjoy comedy, horror, and animation.  The last show I binged was Abbott Elementary.  Loved it.  Other shows I have watched are Bob’s Burgers, Community, RuPaul’s Drag Race both us and international seasons, Evil Lives Here (I’ll watch almost any true crime show), Monsters Inside Me, Steven Universe, and Adventure Time.  As far as video games go I play a ton of them lately I have been replaying Cyberpunk 2077 and playing Coral Island when I want something more chill.  I listen to quite a few podcasts my favorites being Midnight Burger, These Strange Woods, Unwell, and a slew of true crime shows. Music wise I listen to a lot of genres but really enjoy electronic, musicals, upbeat music with heavy bass, and pop music.  Most of the time my taste in music is very heavily reliant on the lyrics.  I am very kinky.  I am more of a lifestyle kinkster than just in the bedroom.  I have many kinks I like to explore my top two can be found on my profile.  I will say anytime I have mentioned kink I have gotten a lot of messages immediately asking for a laundry list of my kinks.  Please dont’ do that. 

In terms of relationships I’m open to quite a few different dynamics.  I am currently single except for a kink dynamic that I have.  So I have quite a bit of time and attention to give and would like the same in return. Other than that I’m really just looking for someone who meshes with me well and I can have a good time with on a regular basis.  I tend to take things pretty slow. I really want to get to know you and see how we compliment each other before moving forward.  ",1,1764005194.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

I'm not in a great place. I'm including some history for context. I'll edit, but I'm wordy by nature and I don't have anyone to talk to about the heavier things. Because who can really understand this, right? 

I'm a 55 year old single woman in Minnesota, USA. I was raised by a mother who was truly suffering with unmedicated schizophrenia (and an extremely abusive father) while I was growing up. Her delusions were all over the place and all scary. I'm the oldest of four children (three daughters and a son) and every daughter has had a several-years-long turn taking care of her. Obviously the son only has to worry about his created family (not that I'm bitter). My mom turned 79 this year and she's living with the middle daughter (the youngest sister and I had our turns). I tried an intervention for my mom when I was young but the extended family thought I was being mean and wouldn't work with me. She's still delusional (she doesn't even visit reality anymore, except to send birthday and holiday cards) but she doesn't suffer as much now. She was TORMENTED before. It was heart breaking and horrifying. Now she's president of the US (DJT is holding things down publicly but she purchased the United States a couple hundred years ago when she was 10 feet tall) and she's married to a handsome TV star. She's queen of many countries. She has ""many palaces"" but the governments hold all her assets, despite all the work she's done for them. She's lived for hundreds of years and will continue to live because of a program called Forever Young that The World Lab has to make her young again. She's had all her children and grandchildren put in the program as well so we'll all live forever, which is nice. She goes by a different name now and signs all her cards with the new name. When we visit her, she talks to her brain husband constantly (and others, including family members who are also on ""the wire"") and relays what they say. Sometimes if the info is hurtful or scary to her, I'll remind her that the voices often lie to her and impersonate people she knows. That seems to help. 

I have a 28 year old son. When he was 22 (in 2019) had his first psychotic episode. He'd been doing GREAT before then... ran marathons, went to college and moved to a new state for a job. I had to put him in the hospital in 2020, where he stayed for three months. I've studied Psychology my entire life and nothing about his hospital stay was designed to help him (except the meds). Without a doubt this was about compliance and storage for the medical staff and the idea of ever admitting him again unless it's life or death in that moment is unthinkable. He does not stay on his meds. He has to be very terrified before he'll start his meds again, every single time. We're on an approximate 6 month cycle. I'm pretty sure this'll be what kills me. The stress, not the son. 

The latest episode started about 6 weeks ago. He stopped working again. It got bad and I thought he would hit bottom and go on meds but instead, things took a new turn. Now he has, for lack of a better term, super fun ""brain friends."" They talk all the time, all day long. He laughs constantly with them. I'll hear ""OMG dude, did you just say that?"" and laugh. It's fast and witty, like how you are with your best friends. He seems happy. BUT he can't walk outside, he obviously can't work, he watches videos all day which isn't unusual for him but now it's LOUD. He usually has blankets wrapped around his head (and the rest of him), and it's about 30° here at night and he wants to run the air conditioning and needs all the lights on. These things make me think he's not so happy. 

So I have two things weighing on me like...idk, what's heavier than bricks? *Wait..I looked it up. Osmium is the heaviest thing*  Solutions welcome. They're needed, in fact. 

One: At some point, I will be unable to take care of my son. He does not have three daughters to care for him. He's needs to be better and do better than my mom did. And I need to be better and do better with him than I was with my mom. What do I do? What would be the inspiration for him to take meds now that his voices are his besties? What words do I even say? ""I know you're happy and you finally feel like you have the kind of friendships that you've always wanted, including the perma-witty repartee, but wouldn't you rather destroy all that in favor of working a dead end job and feeling socially awkward and depressed?"" The best I have is to point out that he should consider that the future won't always include free rent and food, but he was so depressed before, even on meds. I can't imagine a future that might resemble the past will be a selling point. What do I do?  [Quick aside: I know about Nami and I've attended several online support groups (and gave up) which was made up of people who already knew each other and chatted about their situations like old friends at coffee, and got to me about 5 minutes before the end as an afterthought like, ""oh gosh, did you want to add anything?""]

Two: I'm having something like an existential crisis. (Started crying just writing this) I'm so aware of the fact that people can have entire lives that aren't real, sometimes I'll think about calling someone who cares and instead I'll sit down and almost freeze, for minutes or hours, stuck. Do they care? Do I have some friends who love me? I usually don't reach out. I just sit. On the rare occasion I actually discuss the weight of this, their responses often seem callous or aloof. I tell myself that my life is not normal and that it would be hard to relate to my struggles, but is that what's really going on? About a year ago I was confiding (in tears) to a friend and when I finished there was a looong pause and she said ""omg, did you see what so and so just posted?"" Am I not the person I think I am? I feel like I give a lot. And I don't mind it. Actually I love feeling like I can be useful to people. But what if I'm not that person? How much of who I THINK I cultivated is even real? How much of anything I think about my life is real? Who do I ask? How would I ever know? I just read my last paragraph and I hear how whiny I sound. Is this who i always am?

At the seller’s place, they tested it with some very dry beans (not espresso-specific), and it pulled a café.

Once I got home, I filled the hopper with my espresso beans. They’re a bit more oily than the test batch, but nothing extreme, pretty normal, I’d say.

Here’s the issue: the grinder runs, but I’m getting the *“No Beans”* warning light. No coffee is delivered, and the ground beans end up dumped straight into the waste box. I can occasionally coax a cup out of it, but it’s a rare win, maybe one success in five attempts. When I can get one, I found the coffee to be very thin.

I'm writing my first fic, I decided to post a little teaser

Post movie, slow-burn Polytrix with Rumi's mom and dad lore, demon ablilities, and who knows what

**DISCLAIMER**: English is my 3rd language, be kind pls

Here ya go (posting it in text because I only wanna upload to AO3 when I'm totally done):

**The Cost of Acceptance**

**Chapter 1: The war is over, but the cost lives on**

‘‘We see what you are!’’ Zoey and Mira said in unison. ‘‘You are a demon! A mistake!’’

Rumi’s jacket fell on the floor, forgotten. She couldn’t care about her patterns being visible in front of thousands upon thousands of fans. Her whole world was being shattered right there on stage.

Her biggest dream was never sealing the Honmoon, but for Zoey and Mira to accept her demon heritage. That dream fell apart as soon as they started singing Takedown.

Rumi tried to back away from them, but they were circling her, getting closer and closer until──

Her eyes slammed open, she was struggling to breathe, but a quick glance around the room revealed she was in her bed. It was just another nightmare.

As she calmed down, she noticed more and more details. The sun wasn’t up yet. Zoey and Mira were still sleeping next to her, which was nothing short of a miracle. They all had a hard time sleeping since *that night*.

Rumi knew she wouldn’t fall asleep again, so she *very* carefully moved Zoey’s hand from her hair. Zoey grumbled something but didn’t wake up.

Rumi made her way to the kitchen. On the way, she checked the clock in the hallway.

4:36

Well, at least it wasn’t 2 am like yesterday. She made coffee, hoping not to wake her friends with the noise. Now armed with caffeine, she almost felt ready to start the day.

She went to her favorite place of the penthouse, the balcony. Looking at Seoul from above always made her feel powerful, and seeing the new, colorful Honmoon standing strong was calming as always, just what she needed.

She leaned over the railing, watching the Honmoon. The colors were almost dancing, playing with each other. Rumi started to think about the day after the Idol Awards.

After the fight at the stadium, everything was blank. She somehow made it back to the tower with the girls, and they basically were asleep the moment their bodies touched the mattress, only for her to be woken up by Zoey and Mira two hours later, saying they heard screaming and crying.

They’ve been sleeping in the same bed ever since. Even in sleep, the girls’ presence helped, but Rumi still had nightmares every night.

Her thoughts started to wander towards Jinu.

She didn’t know if she should be angry or sad.

Jinu started as her enemy, weakening the Honmoon and stealing souls. But he accepted her for who she is, demon and hunter. He shared his secrets with her.

However, Jinu betrayed her at the Idol Awards. He used her deepest insecurities against her, sending demons in the shape of Zoey and Mira to reveal her patterns to her friends, to break them apart.

She had to give it to him, sacrificing himself in the end helped her defeat Gwi-Ma, and without Jinu’s meddling, her friends wouldn’t know about her patterns today.

After the fight at the stadium, her sword returned to its former shape, it didn’t turn large anymore. Rumi liked to think she somehow set Jinu’s soul free, and he is finally happy with his family.

Her thoughts started getting chaotic again, but settled on the morning after Gwi-Ma’s defeat.

Rumi was already making pancakes for breakfast when she heard Mira coming. Slower, heavier, quieter steps than Zoey’s skipping.

‘‘Morning, Ru! You’re making pancakes?’’ Mira started up the coffee maker, grabbing three mugs from the cupboard.

‘‘Hey Mir! I wanted to make you guys breakfast for once.’’ Rumi smiled at her.

‘‘You know you won’t evade explaining everything by making breakfast, right?’’

‘‘I know. I’m not trying to!’’

Mira just raised her eyebrow.

‘‘You know me so well,’’ Rumi admitted.

They heard Zoey zooming in the hallway, looked each other in the eye, and smirked at each other, knowing Zoey was probably panicking, thinking they left her.

‘‘HOW DARE YOU LEAVE ME─ Ooooh, pancakes!’’ Zoey entered the living room like a tornado of chaotic cuteness.

‘‘Good morning to you as well, Zo!’’ Rumi and Mira chuckled.

‘‘We should totally eat on the couch today’’ Zoey proposed. Eating on the couch is a festive tradition for her, meaning she was looking forward to Rumi’s story a lot.

‘‘Zoey, you’re gonna stain it again!’’ Mira groaned.

‘‘Mir, the couch is fourteen couches long, a few spots won’t be in the way. I promise I’ll clean it later’’ Zoey said while looking at Mira with puppy eyes.

Mira gave in, as she always does. Zoey is too adorable, only a truly evil person could make her sad.

After they finished eating, Rumi put her plate down on the coffee table, took a deep breath, and asked:

‘‘You have questions first, or should I just start?’’

1p5n56m,https://www.reddit.com/r/illit/comments/1p5n56m/not_cute_anymore_is_such_a_cool_concept_about/,"NOT CUTE ANYMORE is such a cool concept about being true to yourself, or not","Here's some of my thoughts on the song because I have no one to share this with and im too excited to not share >< IK everything imma say is pretty obvious but I just wanna talk about it.

So for starters, the title ""not cute anymore"" is very much not meant to say they are no longer cute. Actually kinda the opposite- they are trying to not be cute, but it's inauthentic.

The opening shot of the glittery pink tombstone saying cute is dead sets it all up. That's such an absurd and unrealistic concept, of course that would never happen. If this song was genuinely meant to show them not being cute it would open with a shot of them being so badass and mature, but it can't open like that, because they aren't like that. The silly opening shot sets the tone of the whole mv as tongue in cheek.

btw im not gonna analyse every shot and line lol, but it's worth looking at the opening one of each since they're important and carefully chosen.

The opening line ""my bag's so brave, no keyring no handmirror"". Three things here: First the fact that they think simple things like keyrings is what is making them cute is quite naive, and listing out very specific things like this very much gives the impression that them not being cute it is overthought, not natural. Second, this change being ""so brave"" for them shows how its not authentic. Your style should be comfortable to you. Third, ""keyring"" is one of many references to trendy or ""performative"" things that will come up throughout the song.

My favourite funny shots that show them not being cute: where moka looks stunned after taking a sip of black coffee and hating it, then being caught slipping a block of sugar into it. She wants the mature look of drinking straight black coffee instead of sweet drinks but thats just not her. 

Another is the shot of minju turning her back to the camera and throwing up a 🤘 sign. It's so corny and funny lmao, making the viewer have that reaction is the perfect way to make you experience firsthand that this attempted  ""not cute"" rebrand is not working.

Ok onto the theme of being performative. There are a few references to trends (matcha, keychains, vinyls) but my favourite is ""limited edition kongguksu, matcha's got nothing on this"". Kongguksu is a kind of traditional korean cold noodle dish btw, I had to look it up. It definitely isn't a substitute for matcha in any way. So basically they are dropping one trendy thing for another- it's funny because even in their not cute rebrand they are only eating the kongguksu because it's limited edition. Which is quite an absurd image as far as I can tell, it's a very traditional sorta dish- it being trendy or limited is really silly. It would be like replacing bubble tea with minestrone or something 😭 just completely out of left field. That just once again shows the inauthenticity of it all- the fact they think eating kongguksu instead of matcha is what cool people do is so funny. 

It's clear that them being cool is completely a performance. I think its interesting to think about how this is in contrast to keychains,  matcha and makeup tutorials which are trends people often get accused of being performative over. In that way the song is a reversal of the common scenario where people performatively like these things to seem cute or aesthetic. 

I mean I'm not making any groundbreaking discoveries here, there is literally the line ""I'm too shy for all these"", they are clearly trying to be something they aren't

Anyway in conclusion: don't worry ILLIT are still cute. Sorry for the yap, I just wanted an excuse to talk about the song and my favourite funny or interesting lines. Not only is it super catchy but the lyrics are genuinely funny, I love this song so much.

edit: oh MOST IMPORTANTLY: its cool how this plays into the other message which shows on the opening screen saying: ""there is more to me than being cute"". It seems they are going to all this effort to change themselves because they are tired of people not taking them seriously or not respecting them because they are seen as ""just cute"". The truth is, and the ultimate message, they do like that stuff and shouldn't have to pretend otherwise to earn people's respect. They should be allowed to like things people deem as cute and not be infantilised or looked down on because of it.",21,1764005030.0,illit,3,0.96,False

1p5n24i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthChallenges/comments/1p5n24i/the_reality_of_habit_design_and_adherence/,The Reality of Habit Design and Adherence,"Over the past few weeks I've been understanding what makes habits stick. What turns goals into behaviours, so being healthy doesn't feel forced, but desirable.

You're trying to get to a point where a habit is no longer a habit.

Building healthy habits that last is a lot harder than the internet makes it sound.

We start with the best intentions. A new training plan. A tighter bedtime. Less scrolling, more reading. For a week or two you’re on it. Then work ramps up, a friend’s birthday happens, you travel, you get sick… and the habit quietly slides into the same pile as all the others you once cared about.

It’s not that you don’t know what to do. You’ve seen the diagrams. You’ve read the “21 days to build a habit” posts, the atomic advice, the motivational quotes.

The problem isn’t a lack of information.

The problem is that most habit advice is written for a version of you who isn’t tired, stressed, socially entangled, emotionally triggered or dealing with three competing priorities at once.

This isn’t a post about how to create more habits. It’s about what actually keeps them alive in the real world – with all its mess, noise and competing demands.

# Habits As Identity

A habit starts as something you *do*.  
It lasts when it becomes part of who you *are*.

On paper, that sounds simple: “Don’t try to go to the gym. Become the kind of person who trains.”

In reality, identity is built from evidence. Your brain doesn’t fully believe you’re “a runner” because you wrote it in a journal. It believes it because you have a growing stack of mornings where you laced up your shoes and went, even when it was raining, even when you weren’t in the mood.

This is the first reality of habit design:

A habit has to survive long enough, often enough, under enough different conditions, that it becomes part of your self-story.

That means two things:

* You don’t need perfection for identity. You need repetition under varied conditions.
* The “unconscious” feeling – the sense that you just do the thing – comes later than you want.

Treat the early phase of a habit like teaching your brain who you are. Every time you show up, especially when it would have been easier not to, you’re casting a vote. Most days it’s a small, ordinary vote. Occasionally it’s a big one. Over time, the tally shifts.

The goal isn’t “I never miss.”  
The goal is “I miss far less often than I used to, and I come back faster when I do.”

# Designing For Real Life, Not Your Best Day

A lot of habit advice is secretly based on your fantasy schedule.

You design the perfect morning routine: meditation, journalling, mobility, 45-minute workout, cold shower, heroic breakfast. It looks great on paper because you’re designing it on a calm Sunday afternoon.

But habits don’t live on calm Sundays. They live on Thursday nights when you’re exhausted and behind on email. They live in airport lounges, in hotel rooms, at your in-laws’ house, after a rough day with your team, when your child is ill or your partner needs you.

Real habit design starts from a different question:

“What is the smallest, clearest version of this habit that I can still do on a bad day?”

Instead of stacking ten new behaviours, you start with one or two that actually move the needle. You give them a clear time and place. You build around your existing routines instead of pretending you can create whole new ones from scratch.

You can still stack habits. In fact, stacking is powerful. But stacking only works when it respects capacity.

Most people don’t fail because their habits are the wrong size on day one. They fail because their habits ignore the reality of day twenty-three, when the novelty has worn off and life is louder again.

Design for that day.

# The Quiet Power Of Habit Stacking

When you hear “habit stacking”, it’s easy to imagine an impressive tower: read, meditate, stretch, train, cook, journal, all before 8 a.m.

The reality is far more modest – and far more effective.

Habit stacking is less about quantity and more about sequence. It’s about choosing a few pivotal behaviours and attaching them to something that’s already firmly rooted in your life.

Coffee is a root. Your commute is a root. Brushing your teeth is a root.

If you attach a new behaviour to a solid root, it stands a chance. If you hang it in mid-air, it doesn’t.

The overlooked part is **order**.

Start with the habits that make all the others easier – sleep, basic movement, food that doesn’t wreck your energy, a simple system for managing your day. These are keystone habits. They stabilise you enough that adding more becomes realistic.

You don’t need to build a cathedral of habits. You need a small, load-bearing structure that can survive both good and bad weeks.

# Protecting Your Habits

Most habits are not broken in isolation. They’re broken in company.

Dinners run late. Drinks are poured. Weekends away appear on the calendar. Someone you care about wants “one more round” or “another episode” or “come on, just skip it today, it’s not a big deal.”

And they’re often right: missing one day is not a big deal.

What *is* a big deal is what repeated, unexamined social friction does to your habits over time.

Part of realistic habit design is accepting that your environment includes the people you spend time with. If your entire social life revolves around late nights, heavy food and no movement, you’re asking one person (you) to swim against a current generated by many.

You don’t need to become antisocial. You do need some **social barriers** and scripts.

“I don’t drink on weeknights.”  
“I leave by 10:30, even if I’m having a good time.”  
“I always go for a short walk after dinner.”

At first, those lines feel awkward. They create tiny moments of tension. But with repetition, people adapt. Your boundaries become part of how they know you.

The habit survives not because you have superhuman willpower, but because you’ve reshaped the social context just enough that the default is no longer sabotage.

In the end, adherence isn’t only about what you do alone at 6 a.m. It’s also about what you’re willing to defend, gently but firmly, at 10 p.m. with other people in the room.

# Flexing The Habit Without Breaking It

All-or-nothing thinking quietly kills more habits than “laziness” ever will.

You commit to training five times a week. Then you travel, your schedule explodes, or you can’t get to the gym. You miss a day. Then another. The story in your head becomes, “I’ve already blown it, I’ll restart properly next month.”

Underneath that is a fragile rule:  
“If I can’t do the full version, I might as well do nothing.”

The reality of long-term adherence is the opposite.

The skill is not doing the ideal habit every time. The skill is **altering** the habit without abandoning it.

No gym? Do 10–15 minutes of bodyweight work in your room.  
No time for a full run? Walk briskly for 20 minutes.  
Too drained for deep work? Tidy your task list and set up one clear priority for tomorrow.

From the outside, these look small, even trivial. From the inside, they’re crucial because they preserve the pattern:

“When it’s time to train, I train – in some form.”  
“When it’s time to move, I move – at some level.”

You’re teaching your brain that the identity holds even when the expression changes. That makes it far easier to ramp intensity back up when life calms down, because you never fully dropped the thread.

Flexible adherence looks unimpressive in any single moment. But over a year, it is the difference between a habit that weathered ten storms and one that drowned in the first wave.

# Adherence As Probability, Not Perfection

It’s tempting to treat habit design like engineering: build the perfect system, and you’ll never fail again.

Human beings don’t work like that.

You have moods, seasons, hormones, deadlines, grief, joy, illness, new opportunities. What “works” for you one year may not fit the next.

The honest goal of habit design isn’t flawless execution. It’s increasing the **probability** that the future version of you will do the right thing often enough.

You tilt the odds by:

* Choosing habits that genuinely matter to you, not ones you think you “should” want.
* Anchoring them to the life you actually live, not the fantasy one in your head.
* Letting them evolve as your circumstances change, instead of clinging to the exact form forever.
* Designing for the rough days as much as the smooth ones.
* Being willing to recommit after you drop the ball, without turning a stumble into a story about your character.

Seen that way, habit design stops being a self-judgement exercise and becomes something else: a quiet act of respect for your future self.

You’re not promising perfection. You’re building a world – internal and external – where doing what you said you’d do is a little more likely, again and again, across hundreds of ordinary days.

That’s the unglamorous reality of habit adherence.

Not magic.  
Not hacks.  
Just a thoughtful relationship between who you want to be, the life you actually have, and the small decisions you’re willing to keep making when it would be easier to forget the whole thing.",1,1764004844.0,HealthChallenges,1,1.0,False
1p5n1sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/engaged/comments/1p5n1sz/enhance_your_destination_wedding_guests_experience/,Enhance your Destination Wedding Guests' Experience,"Hey DW Couples!

As you know, Weddings (whether in the US or international) have their own trend cycles. The biggest shift in 2025/2026 DW planning is moving from a ""wedding day"" to a ""wedding week"", and making every moment count for your traveling guests. Your loved ones are spending significant time and money to celebrate with you, so making their experience more curated and fun is the new top priority.

I've gathered the most impactful trends focused purely on making your guests feel immersed in the experience.

You went through all the effort of gathering a group in an international vacation together. Instead of sitting by the pool all day, organize some small but fun activities that feel authentic to the destination. Some ideas can be completely free of charge like a pickleball, ping pong, or volleyball tournament with the guests. Want something less active? Try a private Taco and Tequila tasting for the group. A little more romantic? A sunset catamaran is always a special addition. The goal is to facilitate natural mingling among the different friend groups before the wedding day.

To make guests feel special upon arrival, DW couples have started getting more creative with weaving local culture into welcome gifts for the guests. Think custom curated local spice blends, possibly local coffee/chocolates, or even a candle/oil diffuser with the hotel's signature scent to bring them right back to the trip when they get home. If you're in a especially hot destination, think about a personalized fan to keep your guests cool during events.

Another way to enhance guest experience from the jump is being intentional with Guest Communication. As an advisor, I begin this with a Wedding Website that provides all the information guests need for booking. With my contact information on the website, guests are immediately able to feel like they have a personal concierge to ask questions and make changes (taking all this stress off you as the leaders). I love to customize my sites to include all additional activities and timelines that are important for guests. All DW guests I assist get a customized travel itinerary includes group events, travel logistics (immigration info, tipping guide, transportation details), and timelines again to prepare them right before travel. In addition, What's App is a great way to send live updates to guests during the trip, like a ""heads up, the wedding is in 30 minutes!"" to avoid any mishaps.

But I know I won’t and will settle for a fantasy. 

It’s was 130 in the morning when I wrote this. 

I want the late night talks about everything and nothing. Just because we like the sound of each other’s voice. 

I want the share a stupid memes. Smile at the, “are people really that stupid? Yes they are.” 

I want to celebrate achievements. No matter how small. You got through the day without smacking an idiot! Let’s toast! 

I want a best friend I can spill my secrets to and I know they’ll be safe. And someone who can easily talk to and confide in me. 

I want someone I can cuddle up with watching a movie. Though I know we won’t be close, the dream of you being there is enough. 

I want someone to share, “does this dress make me look fat?” And you horribly lie to me. 

Which color should I have my nails? 

Give me a virtual hug and be there when I’m having a bad day. 

The reason I know I’m hard to love in person, is because I have hypothyroidism. If my meds are too low or too high my mood swings, some days I don’t even want to be near me. 

I want someone to be there to encourage me. 

I’ve tried the dating apps. The last date I went on the guy talked about himself and how much money (yawn!) he had. For three hours! Seriously every time I opened my mouth he continued. 

I don’t care where you live. As I live in Illinois. 

Looks don’t bother me but I do request a picture to know who I’m talking to. I personally don’t care what your excuse is. You share your picture I’ll share mine. 

We don’t need to exchange digits (shows my age) but a voice platform is required. 

My job is 99% in front of a screen writing emails and texting. I don’t want to spend months chatting on here. 

Whatever excuse you have I’ve heard it. I know what I’m looking for and you’re probably not it. When you know you know. 

If I’m not your type. That’s fine. Tell me. I’ll wish you luck and be on my way. 

So what is my type? I don’t have a type per se. I do have standards. I’m a bitchy, moody, I am my father’s daughter woman. I don’t chase. You say goodbye, I’ll say the same and move on. You get mad over something I said or a miscommunication, bye! This homey don’t play those games. lol 

Respond with your age, location and you understand what my post is about. I am looking for a friend. Everything and Nothing more. Ask me a question and if appropriate I will answer honestly. 

The musts
Have a sense of humor. 
Understand talk to text is not my friend. 
I am a non functioning woman before my first cup of coffee. So what I say may not make sense. 

Do not. I repeat do not…
Ask me what I do. I am in media. Leave it at that until we get to know each other better. 
Ask me what I’m looking for. 
Asking me what I like to do, same as you or not the same. It’s a general response. 
Start off with a singular introduction. That leads me to believe you can’t hold a conversation. 
Do not ask me my age. 
Please be respectful. If I don’t answer right away I’m probably sleeping or at work. 

I do have a very slight drawl to my speaking. 

If you’re ready to lose sleep over late night chats. Laugh at stupid memes. And be the reason you smile at your phone. Would love to hear from you. 

I’m gonna repeat this. Age please be above 30. Will only speak to you if you’re older than 30. Must share a picture. Of face. Nothing else. Must be willing to do voice. Not married. Sorry I have enough married male friends. 

I’m very blunt and straight to the point. I ask and say what I do for a reason. It’s now 11 in the morning. Merry Monday! 

Oh if you couldn’t be bothered to read through this, we can’t be friends.

My big big problem is no matter how much i do or don’t eat (mostly don’t) the numbers don’t go down. now for reference i am 5’6 and weight >!12 stone 13lbs!<. i think thats around >!82kgs!<, so im pretty chonky. i’m not severly overweight but i am overweight and that’s so horrible to me and i HATE it. the thing that pisses me off is that i can just stop eating for DAYS and it literally does nothing to my weight but i can look thinner. but my weight will stay the same maybe go down like >!1-3 lbs!< but thats it and thats after like a week of not eating maybe longer. it’s the SECOND i eat the tiniest thing or even just drink a black coffee, i bloat and gain about >!1-5 lbs!< which is insane. 

does anyone know why this actually is? i dont binge anymore (thankfully) but my mum and granny are both bakers and bake every single week so im also surrounded by desserts and sweet treats but i dont have a sweet tooth (again lucky) but its still like the smell and the look it knocks me sick and sometimes at night its a little here and there but never anything massive. 

i just want to be thinner and to weigh less. its ruining my life and always has done. i hate being this weight and i want it to stop, im so sick of constantly putting on weight or mainting weight. please can someone help? ",4,1764004687.0,EDAnonymous,2,1.0,False

What usually happens:

- You make a coupon on your site

- Maybe send 1 email, 1 LinkedIn post

- Then hope somebody magically finds it

I’m trying a different approach this year.

I put up a simple directory:[ **bigblackfriday.sale**](https://bigblackfriday.sale)

- It’s just a clean page with Black Friday deals from small businesses, SaaS, courses, agencies, etc.

- People can browse by category, see old price vs BF price, click through to buy

My side of the deal:

For **$9**, I will:

- Add your offer to the directory

- Write a short, clear blurb for it (what it is, who it’s for, why it’s a good deal)

- Include it when I promote the directory in:

  - Reddit threads asking for BF deals

  - A few founder / marketer communities I’m part of

  - My own social posts where I’m curating deals

This is not life-changing “instant 10k customers”, but:

- It’s one more place your offer lives

- Someone else is doing the distribution legwork

- The cost is roughly 1 cheap coffee + 15 minutes you don’t have to spend

If you’ve got a Black Friday deal (SaaS, consulting package, course, digital product, etc.), you can:

- Comment with: link + normal price + BF price + short description

- Or go to **bigblackfriday.sale** and submit it there

If you think this is dumb, say that too. I’m honestly testing whether a tiny, honest directory + low ticket promo fee makes sense for small operators.",2,1764004439.0,smallbusiness,4,0.56,False

1p5msds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1p5msds/am_i_being_gaslit/,Am I being gaslit?,"Ok, I want to preface by saying PLEASE be as objective as you can be. I will try my hardest to state the facts as I can. The last thing I need is confirmation bias.

I have been with my wife for 16 years. We have two children. 

Over our 12 year marriage I have had periods where I felt completely disconnected from my wife. In the last few years this has been really haunting me. I absolutely love her to pieces and it often feels one way only.

I was at this award ceremony with my wife for her job a couple of years ago and when one of her male coworkers received an award my wife's body language absolutely perked up in a way that made every alarm in my subconcious go off. I kept that in the back of my mind. She has a coworker (lets call him Jack) that she has known for 5 years. She has only rarely mentioned him ever when she otherwise mentions her male coworkers (she has a bunch) regularly. She has mentioned when asked that she thinks he is good looking. He is also a known flirt at the office. He was single until getting married this year and all of a sudden they have completely stopped communicating.

Now to preface, my wife regularly goes for walks at lunch with male friends and it never bothers me because I hear about their stories and she tells me about what is going on in their lives. 

Jack, however, I NEVER heard about. Because he was on my radar I asked her about him probably every 3 months the last few years and get a one sentence dismissive answer. Something didn't sit right with me.

In August I woke up at 4am and my brain was screaming at me to check her phone messages. I went right for Jack in her phone and found this. I will try to itemize what happened to try and not inject bias and insecurity:

\- only one example of overt flirting. He said he had lost 20 pounds and she said ""you must be really lean now"" and he said ""yes my abs are showing"" and she said ""lol I bet""  
\- 4 years of texting regularly throughout the week. He regularly asked her what her schedule was during the day so that he could arrange to visit her in her office. She happily told him the times she would be in her office. She has no other friendship with ANYONE in her phone with this much conversation or meeting up. She also went to visit him many times when his schedule allowed and they arranged it in advance.  
\- They arranged to work out at the office gym together twice that I can see.   
\- She has acknowledged since that she always saw him at the gym (I asked her before who she works out with at the office gym and she said she was always alone)  
\- He regularly told her he likes their chats together. She said she did too.   
\- One time she said she has to think about how early in the morning she can message him, because she doesn't want to wake him up.  
\- There are weird illogical gaps where it looks like some texts were deleted.  
\- They both mentioned how they keep their phones on do not disturb at all times.  
\- She mentioned that at night her office department is a ghost town. He mentioned he would be in the office one week in the evenings and wanted to know when she would be in. She happily told him. She has stated she ""does not recall"" if they were ever alone in her office at night.  
\- He switched to a different company office in  a different part of town. She texted him saying she misses having him around. He said he misses talking to her too.  
\- Once he switched company offices they made 7 arrangements to hang out outside of work for a workout or go for lunch, coffee ""or whatever"". She insists that she had no intention of actually spending time with him outside of work and that they never did. She did text him though repeatedly saying she would drive across town to hang out with him. I cannot see evidence they did though. She said ""I never would have actually met up with him""  


\- When confronted:  
\- first words were ""I know the optics look bad but there is nothing to worry about""  
\- I haven't seen him in a year (This was COMPLETELY FALSE, she had seen him weeks earlier by accident apparently. They had worked out together at the office gym a few months prior)  
\- She is tired of my insecurity  
\- She will never see him again, so don't worry  
\- He means ""less than nothing"" and the idea of them together is ""laughable""  
\- Why dwell on the past?  
\- He flirts with everyone  
\- He was a surface friend only.  
\- He latched onto her, she was always ""brushing him off""  
\- She has never been physical with anyone else including kissing.

I should note she initiated sex for the first time in years that evening, basically jumped me. She told me how she likes to be kissed and she had not said that EVER in 16 years of us being together.

\- a week later she admitted:  
\- the friendship ""snuck up on her""  
\- Yes the texting was innappropriate but that is it.  
\- she thought it was ""harmless""  
\- She reiterated nothing physical ever happened.  
\- We were on a walk and I mentioned that when we got home I wanted to see in her phone as a way of regaining trust. She sat on the ground and started BAWLING uncontrollably. At one point she pulled her hoody over her head and covered her face for a minute while she cried. When we got home she thrust the phone into my hands and went to the bedroom where she cried and cried and cried. I felt really bad for her so after a minute of not finding anything I gave her her phone back. I am feeling overwhelmingly like I missed an opportunity to find something here and that now it will all be deleted if it ever existed.

Two weeks later after speaking with her therapist:  
\- ""my confessions were not true, out friendship was completely harmless. You got in my head but really I didn't do anything wrong at all.""

3 months later:  
\- ""I should have put up boundaries, I am sorry""  
\- ""Our friendship was inappropriate""  
\- ""Our interactions were disrespectful to you and I am sorry""  
\- ""nothing physical happened""  
\- ""Maybe he doesn't message me anymore because he got married. Don't worry, it is done. But it also wasn't anything at all anyway and you have to move on.""  
\- ""I NEVER felt feelings for him. I never even got butterflies for him. He was only a friend and I NEVER flirted with him. Any flirting did not come from my direction""  
\- ""you're never going to let this go. You're obsessing over it and building it up more than it is. You have to move on""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So here are my quandaries

\- I am HAUNTED by thinking about the kissing comment she made, how she pulled the hoody over her head and what that means, and whether anything happened if they were alone in her office. It has been months now and I am worried I will never ever get over this. I don't know what to do.  
\- I also believe that my wife is full on lying about flirting. I think she had a multi year emotional affair I never would have found out about. I am worried I cannot get over that either.   
\- I am madly in love with her too. The thought of divorce kills me. I am tortured though and I do not know if it will ever end.

With 72% of business owners concerned about cybersecurity risks from remote work, and the average data breach costing small businesses $120,000—an amount that forces 60% of breached companies to close within six months—implementing proper security isn't optional anymore.

A business VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of the most effective and affordable security measures you can implement. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about setting up a VPN for your small business in 2025, from understanding why you need one to choosing the right solution and implementing it step-by-step.

# Why Your Small Business Needs a VPN

# The Current Threat Landscape

The cybersecurity environment in 2025 has become increasingly hostile toward small and medium-sized businesses. Here's why:

**Small Businesses Are Prime Targets**: 46% of all cyber breaches impact businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees. Cybercriminals view small businesses as ""low-hanging fruit"" because they typically have valuable data but lack the robust security infrastructure of larger corporations.

**The Cost Is Devastating**: Cybercrime is set to cost businesses up to $10.5 trillion by 2025. For small businesses specifically, individual incidents are crushing—with median losses of $46,000 per ransomware or business email compromise incident.

**Ransomware Is Exploding**: Ransomware demands increased by 140% in 2024, and the rise of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) has grown by 60% in 2025, making sophisticated attacks accessible to even amateur hackers.

# What a Business VPN Protects Against

A business VPN creates a secure connection over the internet between your devices and your company's network. Here's what it specifically protects:

**Data in Transit**: All data traveling between remote employees and your company servers is encrypted, making it unreadable to hackers intercepting the connection.

**Public Wi-Fi Vulnerabilities**: Remote workers often connect from coffee shops, airports, and home networks. A VPN encrypts their traffic even on untrusted networks.

**Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: By creating an encrypted tunnel, VPNs prevent attackers from intercepting communications between employees and company resources.

**Credential Theft**: 80% of all hacking incidents involve compromised credentials or passwords. While VPNs don't eliminate this risk entirely, they significantly reduce the attack surface.

**Remote Access Security**: VPNs provide secure access to internal company resources without exposing them directly to the internet.

# Business vs Consumer VPNs: Critical Differences

Many small business owners make the mistake of thinking a consumer VPN like NordVPN or ExpressVPN (in their consumer form) will suffice for business needs. This is a costly misconception.

# Key Differences

|Feature|Consumer VPN|Business VPN|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Primary Purpose**|Anonymous browsing, content access|Secure remote access to company resources|
|**User Management**|Individual accounts|Centralized admin control panel|
|**Access Control**|All-or-nothing|Granular permissions per user/group|
|**Network Integration**|No integration|Active Directory, SSO, IdP integration|
|**Audit Logs**|Minimal or none|Comprehensive logging and monitoring|
|**Support**|Email/chatbot|Priority support, dedicated account manager|
|**Compliance**|Not designed for compliance|SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR compliance options|
|**Scalability**|Device-based|User-based, easily scales|
|**Cost**|$3-12/month per person|$5-15/month per user|

# Why Consumer VPNs Aren't Suitable

Unlike a consumer VPN, which targets mainly personal users who are looking to protect traffic or access resources from other regions, a business VPN is intended for remote and secure access to business resources on corporate private networks with centralized control capabilities.

Consumer VPNs lack:

* **Centralized management** to control who accesses what
* **Integration** with your existing business tools (Active Directory, cloud apps)
* **Compliance certifications** required for many industries
* **User-level access controls** to protect sensitive data
* **Detailed audit logs** needed for security monitoring

# Choosing the Right VPN Solution

# Step 1: Assess Your Needs

Before selecting a VPN, answer these questions:

1. **How many remote workers do you have?** This determines your licensing needs.
2. **What resources need protection?** File servers, databases, internal applications?
3. **Do you have existing IT infrastructure?** On-premises servers vs. cloud-only?
4. **What's your technical expertise level?** Will you manage this in-house or need support?
5. **What's your budget?** Factor in both setup and ongoing costs.
6. **Do you have compliance requirements?** HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.?

# Types of VPN Solutions

# Cloud-Based VPNs (Recommended for Most Small Businesses)

**Best for**: Companies with limited IT resources, cloud-first operations, or rapid deployment needs.

Cloud-based VPNs can be set up in as little as 10 minutes with no hardware to purchase or configure. The provider manages the infrastructure, updates, and maintenance.

**Advantages**:

* Quick setup (minutes, not days)
* No hardware costs
* Automatic updates
* Scales easily as you grow
* Works from anywhere

**Examples**: NordLayer, Twingate, OpenVPN CloudConnexa

# Self-Hosted VPNs

**Best for**: Companies with existing IT staff, specific customization needs, or on-premises data centers.

You deploy and manage your own VPN server using software like OpenVPN Access Server. You control everything but handle all maintenance.

**Advantages**:

* Complete control
* Can customize extensively
* No recurring service fees (only licensing)
* Data stays on your infrastructure

**Disadvantages**:

* Requires technical expertise
* You handle all updates and maintenance
* Need to manage server infrastructure

**Examples**: OpenVPN Access Server, WireGuard, strongSwan

# Hardware VPN Appliances (Legacy Approach)

**Best for**: Large businesses with dedicated IT teams and existing network infrastructure.

Physical devices installed at your office location. This is the traditional approach and generally not recommended for small businesses due to cost and complexity.

# Step-by-Step VPN Setup Guide

This guide covers cloud-based VPN setup, which is appropriate for most small businesses. The specific steps will vary slightly by provider, but the general process is similar.

# Prerequisites

Before beginning:

* \[ \] Choose your VPN provider and complete signup
* \[ \] Identify who needs VPN access (create a user list)
* \[ \] Determine which resources employees need to access
* \[ \] Have admin access to your company's domain/identity provider (if applicable)
* \[ \] Prepare to communicate the change to your team

# Phase 1: Initial Configuration (15-30 minutes)

# Step 1: Create Your Admin Account

1. Sign up with your chosen VPN provider
2. Verify your email address
3. Complete any required business verification
4. Set up your admin dashboard login with a strong password and MFA

# Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

1. **Set your organization name** in the admin dashboard
2. **Choose your primary server locations** \- Select servers geographically close to your team for best performance
3. **Configure DNS settings** \- Use your VPN provider's DNS or integrate with your existing DNS
4. **Set up network resources** \- Define which internal resources (file servers, databases, apps) should be accessible through the VPN

# Step 3: Integrate with Identity Providers (Optional but Recommended)

SSO and IdP will be needed for the most secure employee identification and authentication.

If you use:

* **Google Workspace**: Connect via SAML integration
* **Microsoft 365/Azure AD**: Use Azure AD connector
* **Okta or other IdP**: Follow provider-specific integration guides

This allows employees to use their existing company credentials and enables automatic user provisioning/deprovisioning.

# Phase 2: User Setup and Deployment (30-60 minutes)

# Step 4: Add Users

In your admin dashboard:

1. Add users individually or bulk import from CSV
2. Assign each user to appropriate groups/teams
3. Define access levels per user or group
4. Send invitation emails to users

# Step 5: Configure Access Controls

Create an access control list, which will be important down the line.

Define which users/groups can access which resources:

* Marketing team: Access to shared drives, design tools
* Finance team: Access to accounting software, sensitive financial systems
* Development team: Access to code repositories, staging servers
* All staff: Access to general resources like email, intranet

# Step 6: Deploy Client Software

Roll out the same VPN client setup across all employee devices to keep security consistent.

**For Employees**:

1. Download VPN client from provider's website or app store
2. Install and launch the application
3. Log in with company credentials
4. Select server (usually automatic)
5. Connect to VPN

**For IT Admins** (if managing deployment):

* **Windows**: Use MSI packages with Group Policy
* **macOS**: Create configuration profiles and installer bundles
* **Mobile (iOS/Android)**: Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to push configurations
* **Linux**: Provide CLI installation scripts

# Phase 3: Security Hardening (30 minutes)

# Step 7: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Deploy MFA for all VPN users—it stops attackers even if passwords are stolen.

1. Enable MFA requirement in admin settings
2. Choose MFA methods (authenticator app recommended)
3. Require all users to set up MFA on next login
4. Provide clear instructions with screenshots

# Step 8: Configure Security Policies

Essential security settings:

* **Enable kill switch**: Blocks internet if VPN disconnects
* **Set connection timeout**: Auto-disconnect after inactivity
* **Enforce encryption standards**: AES-256 or ChaCha20
* **Enable DNS leak protection**: Ensures DNS queries go through VPN
* **Configure split tunneling** (optional): Split tunneling allows traffic to pass through the network only if necessary, while more bandwidth-intensive activities like video calls go through a direct connection

# Step 9: Set Up Monitoring and Alerts

Enable logging and alerts to track suspicious access attempts in real time.

Configure alerts for:

* Failed login attempts (3+ failures)
* Logins from unusual locations
* Access to sensitive resources
* Long-duration sessions (potential compromised account)
* Users accessing resources outside their permissions

# Phase 4: Testing and Validation (30 minutes)

# Step 10: Conduct Testing

Before rolling out to all employees:

1. **Test connectivity**: Verify employees can connect from different locations/networks
2. **Test resource access**: Confirm users can reach the resources they need
3. **Test performance**: Check connection speeds and latency
4. **Test MFA**: Ensure authentication flows work properly
5. **Test on different devices**: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android
6. **Test fail scenarios**: What happens if VPN disconnects? Does kill switch work?

# Step 11: Create Documentation

Essential documentation:

* Quick start guide for employees
* Troubleshooting common issues
* Who to contact for support
* Security policies and acceptable use
* Emergency procedures

# Phase 5: Rollout and Training (1-2 hours)

# Step 12: Train Your Team

People are the first line of defense. Provide ongoing education on phishing, social engineering, and safe browsing habits.

Training should cover:

* **Why** the VPN is important (security benefits)
* **When** to use it (always, when working remotely)
* **How** to connect and disconnect
* **What** to do if problems occur
* **Security best practices** while connected

Consider:

* Live training session or recorded video walkthrough
* Written quick-start guide with screenshots
* Q&A session
* Follow-up check-ins after first week

# Step 13: Phased Rollout (Optional)

For larger teams, consider rolling out in phases:

1. **Week 1**: IT team and key stakeholders
2. **Week 2**: Department managers and power users
3. **Week 3**: All remaining employees

This allows you to identify and fix issues before company-wide deployment.

# Step 14: Make VPN Mandatory

Once testing is complete:

1. Set a date when VPN becomes required for remote access
2. Communicate clearly and well in advance
3. Update company security policies
4. Configure network to require VPN for accessing sensitive resources
5. Provide grace period for adoption

# Essential Security Best Practices

Setting up the VPN is just the beginning. These practices ensure it remains effective:

# 1. Enforce Strong Authentication

**Multi-Factor Authentication is Non-Negotiable**: MFA stops attackers even if passwords are stolen. Require MFA for all VPN connections.

**Password Requirements**:

* Minimum 12 characters
* Combination of letters, numbers, symbols
* No reused passwords from other services
* Regular password changes (every 90 days)

23% of SMBs use either a pet's name, a series of numbers, or a family member's name as their password. Don't be part of this statistic.

# 2. Implement Least Privilege Access

ZTNA relies on least privilege access, which means that employees should only have access to the programs and applications that are necessary to do their jobs.

**How to implement**:

* Limit access based on job roles—not all employees need access to every system
* Review access permissions quarterly
* Remove access immediately when employees change roles or leave
* Audit who has access to sensitive resources monthly

# 3. Keep Software Updated

**For IT Admins**:

* Enable automatic updates for VPN server software
* Subscribe to security advisories from your VPN provider
* Test updates in staging environment before production
* Maintain update schedule documented

**For Employees**:

* Require automatic updates for VPN client software
* 18% of SMBs don't require regular software updates—don't be one of them
* Send reminders if updates haven't been applied

# 4. Monitor and Audit Regularly

Review VPN logs monthly—look for unknown IP addresses, repeated login failures, or long sessions.

**Weekly checks**:

* Review failed login attempts
* Check for unusual access patterns
* Verify active connections

**Monthly reviews**:

* Audit user access permissions
* Review and archive logs
* Analyze usage patterns
* Update access controls as needed

**Quarterly reviews**:

* Full security audit
* Review and update security policies
* Test disaster recovery procedures
* Employee security refresher training

# 5. Train Employees Continuously

Security awareness shouldn't be a one-time event:

* **Monthly**: Security tips in company newsletter
* **Quarterly**: Short training videos or meetings
* **Annually**: Comprehensive security training with testing
* **Ongoing**: 41% of SMBs use simulated phishing tests to train employees

Businesses that conduct monthly cybersecurity training see a 70% decrease in employee errors.

# 6. Have an Incident Response Plan

Despite best efforts, breaches can occur. Prepare by:

1. **Documenting procedures** for suspected VPN compromise
2. **Designating response team** members and their roles
3. **Creating communication templates** for different scenarios
4. **Testing the plan** with tabletop exercises
5. **Maintaining updated contact information** for all stakeholders

# Common Challenges and Solutions

# Connection Speed Issues

**Problem**: VPN slows down internet connection significantly.

**Solutions**:

* **Switch servers**: Connect to geographically closer servers
* **Use modern protocols**: WireGuard protocol is a premier choice for modern VPN implementations—it's remarkably simple, presents a small attack surface, and is highly performant
* **Enable split tunneling**: Split tunnel VPNs balance security with speedy access to non-sensitive resources
* **Check bandwidth**: Most remote workers need about 2-5 Mbps for typical business tasks
* **Upgrade internet plan**: If baseline internet is slow, VPN will amplify this

# User Adoption Resistance

**Problem**: Employees don't want to use VPN, find it inconvenient.

**Solutions**:

* **Explain the ""why""**: Share real breach statistics and what's at risk
* **Make it easy**: User-centricity has always been important—when users can easily connect, they're more likely to actually use it
* **Enable auto-connect**: Configure VPN to connect automatically on startup
* **Provide excellent support**: Quick responses to issues prevent frustration
* **Celebrate adoption**: Recognize teams/individuals who consistently use VPN

# Access Control Complexity

**Problem**: Setting up granular access controls is time-consuming and confusing.

**Solutions**:

* **Start simple**: Begin with broad categories (all staff, managers, IT)
* **Use group-based policies**: Easier than individual user permissions
* **Document everything**: Maintain a clear access control matrix
* **Review regularly**: Schedule quarterly access reviews
* **Use templates**: Create standard permission sets for common roles

# Performance During Peak Hours

**Problem**: VPN becomes slow when many employees connect simultaneously.

**Solutions**:

* **Upgrade your plan**: Ensure your plan supports concurrent connection needs
* **Load balance**: Use multiple servers and distribute connections
* **Schedule updates**: Don't let everyone connect for the first time at 9 AM Monday
* **Monitor capacity**: Track concurrent connections and plan for growth

# Ongoing Maintenance and Management

Setting up your VPN isn't a ""set it and forget it"" task. Here's what ongoing maintenance looks like:

# Daily Tasks (Automated)

* Monitor for connection issues or outages
* Review automated alerts for security events
* Ensure backups are running

# Weekly Tasks (15 minutes)

* Review failed login attempts
* Check system performance metrics
* Verify all critical employees can connect
* Review any support tickets

# Monthly Tasks (1-2 hours)

* Review VPN logs monthly—look for unknown IP addresses, repeated login failures, or long sessions
* Audit user access permissions
* Review bandwidth usage and capacity
* Check for available software updates
* Generate and review security reports
* Verify backup integrity

# Quarterly Tasks (2-4 hours)

* Comprehensive security audit
* Update access control policies
* Review and revise user permissions
* Test disaster recovery procedures
* Employee security refresher training
* Review vendor SLA and support responsiveness

# Annual Tasks (1 day)

* Full security assessment
* Evaluate if current VPN solution still meets needs
* Review and renew contracts
* Major policy reviews and updates
* Comprehensive employee training
* Test incident response plan

# When to Scale Up

Consider upgrading or expanding when:

* Approaching 80% of concurrent connection limit
* Adding more than 25% new employees
* Expanding to new office locations
* Adding new cloud services that need protection
* Experiencing regular performance issues
* Compliance requirements change

# Frequently Asked Questions

# How much does a business VPN cost for a small business?

During our research, prices for a business VPN ranged from $2.50 to $16 per user per month. Most quality business VPN solutions cost $5-10 per user monthly. Some providers like Twingate offer free tiers for small teams (up to 5 users), while Tailscale offers free service for up to 100 devices.

For a typical small business with 10 employees, expect to budget $50-100/month ($600-1,200/year).

# Can I just use a consumer VPN like NordVPN or ExpressVPN?

Consumer VPNs lack critical business features: centralized user management, granular access controls, integration with business identity systems, audit logging, and compliance certifications. While consumer VPNs can protect individual internet connections, they can't securely connect employees to your company's internal resources or provide the administrative oversight needed for business security.

That said, NordVPN's business product (NordLayer) and other business-specific offerings are appropriate for business use.

# How long does VPN setup take?

Setting up a business VPN can be done in a matter of minutes for cloud-based solutions. For a small business:

* **Initial admin setup**: 15-30 minutes
* **User configuration**: 30-60 minutes
* **Security hardening**: 30 minutes
* **Testing**: 30 minutes
* **Employee training**: 1-2 hours

Total time from signup to full deployment: **3-5 hours** spread over a few days.

Self-hosted solutions take longer (1-2 days) due to server setup and configuration requirements.

# Do all employees need to use the VPN?

Yes, all employees who access company resources remotely should use the VPN. This includes:

* Full-time remote workers
* Hybrid workers connecting from home
* Employees traveling for business
* Anyone accessing company data from personal devices

The only exception might be employees who work exclusively in-office on company-managed networks, though even they should use VPN when working remotely.

# Will a VPN slow down my internet connection?

Modern VPNs add minimal overhead. WireGuard-based VPNs tend to be more responsive as there's less inherent latency in the protocol. You might see a 5-10% reduction in speed, but this is typically imperceptible for business tasks.

Factors affecting speed:

* **Server distance**: Closer servers = faster connections
* **Protocol choice**: WireGuard and NordLynx are fastest
* **Your internet speed**: A slow baseline connection will be more affected
* **VPN provider infrastructure**: Premium providers invest in high-speed servers

Most remote workers need about 2-5 Mbps for typical business tasks, which is easily achievable even with VPN overhead.

# What happens if the VPN connection drops?

Quality business VPNs include a ""kill switch"" feature that blocks all internet traffic if the VPN disconnects. This prevents accidental exposure of your data. When the connection is restored, the VPN automatically reconnects (if auto-reconnect is enabled).

Employees should be trained to reconnect immediately if they notice the VPN has dropped.

# How do I know if my VPN is working properly?

Check these indicators:

1. **VPN client shows ""Connected"" status**
2. **Your IP address has changed** (use [whatismyip.com](http://whatismyip.com) to verify)
3. **You can access internal company resources** that require VPN
4. **Connection is encrypted** (your VPN client will indicate this)
5. **No DNS leaks** (use [dnsleaktest.com](http://dnsleaktest.com) to verify)

Most VPN clients have built-in connection tests and status indicators.

# What about mobile devices?

All major business VPN providers support iOS and Android. Mobile employees should:

* Install the VPN app from the App Store or Google Play
* Use the same credentials as desktop
* Keep the VPN connected whenever accessing company resources
* Enable auto-connect on trusted networks

Mobile device management brings extra steps but allows IT to push VPN configurations automatically.

# Conclusion: Your Next Steps

Implementing a business VPN is one of the most impactful security measures you can take to protect your small business. With 43% of cyberattacks targeting small businesses annually and prevention investment ROI consistently exceeding 7x, the question isn't whether you can afford to implement a VPN—it's whether you can afford not to.

# Your Action Plan

**This Week**:

1. Assess your current security posture and remote work needs
2. Research 2-3 VPN providers from our recommendations
3. Take advantage of free trials (most offer 14-30 days)
4. Calculate your budget based on user count

**Next Week**: 5. Select your VPN provider and sign up 6. Complete initial configuration 7. Set up test users and conduct testing 8. Create employee documentation

**Within 30 Days**: 9. Roll out VPN to all employees 10. Conduct training sessions 11. Make VPN mandatory for remote access 12. Establish monitoring and maintenance schedule

# Remember

* **Start simple**: Cloud-based VPNs offer the easiest path to security
* **Prioritize training**: Technology alone won't protect you—educated employees are essential
* **Monitor continuously**: Set up logging and review regularly
* **Stay updated**: Cyber threats evolve; your defenses should too
* **Budget appropriately**: The average cost of a breach is $120,000; spending $1,000-2,000 annually on VPN protection is a bargain

The cybersecurity landscape in 2025 demands that small businesses take remote access security seriously. A properly implemented VPN provides essential protection at a reasonable cost, giving you peace of mind that your company data, employee privacy, and business continuity are secure.

1p5mjhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1p5mjhc/the_whole_grind_size_thing/,The Whole Grind Size Thing,"It seems like there are a lot of people new to the Moccamaster that are grinding their coffee too coarse. I theorize that the reason for this is Technivorm guidance to grind “coarser than store grind…medium coarse….like coarse salt”. I think this is confusing people for a number of reasons.

One is that the standard default grind for commercial/retail ground coffee in Europe is finer than that in the US. There are a number of reasons for that but if you are in the US, your grind should be about like what you see when you open a can of Foldgers as a starting point. If you go coarser than that you are probably going the wrong way.

Second, people hear medium coarse and it sounds like that means “pretty darn solidly coarse”. Medium coarse is relative to the default European grind, which is pretty fine.

Third, people hear coarse salt and think of kosher salt. Coarse salt is a terrible example because because salt comes in many different sized granules and its unclear what they are referring to. But most kosher salts are too coarse.

Technivorm USA could do a much better job of adapting their information to the US market. Most people should disregard that advice and just keep grinding their coffee the way they always have. The moccamaster is a standard drip brewer and you use it like you would any other brewer. Its not a special “automated pour over” machine requiring a special grind. Even if it was, you grind finer than US default grind for pour over, not coarser.

But then it started happening every single week. And every time she said it was class related even tho I overheard her telling another person she just wanted the morning free to hang with her bf. I still covered a few times bc I kinda hate saying no.  



Last week she texted me at like midnight begging me to take her early shift bc she had an important appointment. I already worked a double that day and was totally wiped. I said I couldnt cover and she blew up saying I was being selfish and that she always helps me. Thing is she literally never helped me once. When I reminded her she said I was being petty and that real teammates just step up when needed. It honestly made me super annoyed so I told her Im not swapping anymore until she stops lying about the reasons. She told ppl at work Im making her life harder on purpose. Now some coworkers are looking at me weird. AITA for putting a boundary

1p5mdy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1p5mdy2/how_to_use_a_vpn_on_your_laptop/,How to Use a VPN on Your Laptop,"Your laptop contains sensitive information—passwords, bank details, work documents, and personal photos. Every time you connect to public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or hotel, you're potentially exposing this data to hackers. Even at home, your internet service provider (ISP) tracks every website you visit and can sell this data to advertisers.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) solves these problems by creating a secure, encrypted tunnel between your laptop and the internet. Think of it as a private highway for your data that no one else can access or monitor.

In this guide, you'll learn exactly how to set up and use a VPN on your laptop—whether you're using Windows or Mac. By the end, you'll have a VPN protecting your online activities in just a few minutes.

# What is a VPN and Why Do You Need One?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is software that encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a secure server. This process hides your real IP address and location, making your online activity private and anonymous.

**Here's what a VPN does for you:**

**Protects Your Data on Public Wi-Fi**: Public networks at airports, hotels, and cafes are hunting grounds for cybercriminals. A VPN encrypts your data so hackers can't intercept your passwords or credit card information.

**Hides Your Browsing Activity**: Your ISP normally sees every website you visit and can track your online behavior. A VPN prevents this surveillance by encrypting all your traffic.

**Bypasses Geographic Restrictions**: Many streaming services and websites restrict content based on your location. A VPN lets you connect to servers in different countries, giving you access to region-locked content.

**Prevents ISP Throttling**: Some internet providers slow down your connection when you're streaming or downloading large files. A VPN hides what you're doing online, preventing this selective throttling.

According to recent cybersecurity reports, cyber attacks in the U.S. reached 859,532 reported incidents in 2024—a 144% increase since 2018. With threats escalating, using a VPN on your laptop isn't just recommended—it's essential for protecting your digital life.

# Choosing the Right VPN for Your Laptop

Not all VPNs are created equal. Free VPNs often come with data caps, slow speeds, and questionable privacy practices. For reliable protection, you'll want a premium VPN service that offers strong encryption, fast speeds, and a strict no-logs policy.

Based on extensive testing and current market offerings, here are the top three VPNs for laptop users in 2025:

# 1. ExpressVPN - Best Overall for Beginners

ExpressVPN stands out for its exceptional ease of use and reliability. The setup process takes less than five minutes, and its custom Lightway protocol includes post-quantum protection by default, ensuring your data stays secure even against future threats.

**Key Features:**

* Servers in 105 countries with 10 Gbps speeds
* 10-14 simultaneous device connections (depending on plan tier)
* Starting at $3.49/month for a 2-year subscription (Basic plan)
* 30-day money-back guarantee
* 24/7 customer support

**Best For**: Users who want the most reliable performance and are willing to pay slightly more for premium quality.

# 2. NordVPN - Best for Advanced Features

NordVPN is reasonably priced at $2.99/month and delivers exceptional value with advanced security features. Its Threat Protection Pro blocks ads, trackers, and malicious websites automatically.

**Key Features:**

* 8,200+ servers across 165 countries
* Double VPN for extra encryption
* Built-in ad and malware blocker
* 6 simultaneous connections
* 30-day money-back guarantee

**Best For**: Security-conscious users who want advanced privacy features without breaking the bank.

# 3. Surfshark - Best Budget Option

Priced from $1.99/month with the 2-year plan, Surfshark offers a cost-effective solution with unlimited device connections—perfect for protecting every laptop, phone, and tablet in your household with a single subscription.

**Key Features:**

* 4,500+ servers in 100 countries
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* CleanWeb ad blocker included
* Retained 81% of original download speed in recent testing
* 30-day money-back guarantee

**Best For**: Budget-conscious users and families who need to protect multiple devices.

All three options are fully compatible with both Windows and Mac laptops and offer apps that make setup straightforward.

# How to Set Up a VPN on Windows Laptop

Setting up a VPN on Windows is incredibly simple. The process is nearly identical for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Here's the complete step-by-step guide:

# Step 1: Choose and Subscribe to a VPN Service

Visit your chosen VPN provider's website (ExpressVPN, NordVPN, or Surfshark) and select a subscription plan. Most providers offer significant discounts on longer-term plans—typically 2-year subscriptions provide the best value.

Create your account by providing your email address and payment information. You'll receive a confirmation email with your login credentials.

# Step 2: Download the VPN Application

Download the VPN software directly from the provider's website. Navigate to the Downloads or Products section and select the Windows version. The file will be saved to your Downloads folder.

**Important**: Always download VPN software directly from the official provider's website, never from third-party download sites. This ensures you're getting legitimate, unmodified software.

# Step 3: Install the VPN Software

Locate the downloaded file (usually named something like ""ExpressVPN\_Setup.exe"") and double-click it to begin installation. Windows may display a security prompt asking if you want to allow the app to make changes to your device—click ""Yes"" to proceed.

The installation wizard will guide you through the process. In most cases, you can simply click ""Next"" through the prompts using the default settings. The installation typically takes 1-2 minutes.

# Step 4: Launch and Sign In

Once installation is complete, the VPN app should launch automatically. If it doesn't, find the VPN icon on your desktop or in your Start menu and click it.

Choose the Sign-in option or sign in with an activation code if you already have one. Enter the email address and password you created during subscription, or use the sign-in link sent to your email.

# Step 5: Connect to a VPN Server

After signing in, you'll see the VPN's main interface. Most VPN apps feature a large ""Connect"" button prominently displayed on the home screen.

**To connect automatically**: Simply click the ""Connect"" or ""Quick Connect"" button. The VPN will automatically select the fastest server based on your location.

**To choose a specific location**: Look for a server list or location selector (usually accessible via a menu or separate tab). Browse or search for your desired country, then click to connect to that server. This is useful when you want to access content from a specific region.

When connected, you'll see a confirmation message and typically a green indicator showing you're protected. Your internet traffic is now encrypted and routed through the VPN server.

# Step 6: Verify Your Connection

To confirm your VPN is working properly, search for ""what is my IP address"" in Google. The displayed IP address should match your VPN server's location, not your actual location. For example, if you connected to a server in New York, your IP should show a New York location.

**Windows 11 Specific Features**: The ExpressVPN app is fully optimized for Windows 11, with an intuitive interface that allows users to connect to servers with a single click. The app integrates seamlessly with Windows 11's modern interface and includes features like split tunneling for advanced users.

# How to Set Up a VPN on Mac Laptop

The process for Mac users is just as straightforward. Whether you're using macOS Ventura, Sonoma, or an older version, these steps will work for you.

# Step 1: Subscribe to a VPN Service

Visit your chosen VPN provider's website using Safari or your preferred browser. Select a subscription plan—as with Windows, longer-term plans offer better value.

Create your account with your email and payment details. You'll receive confirmation and login credentials via email.

# Step 2: Download the Mac Application

The easiest way to set up a VPN on your Mac is to download the VPN app itself. Navigate to the provider's download page and select the macOS version.

Some VPNs are also available through the Mac App Store, though downloading directly from the provider's website often gives you access to more features and updates more quickly.

# Step 3: Install the VPN Software

Locate the downloaded file in your Downloads folder (usually a .dmg file for Mac applications). Double-click the file to mount the disk image.

A new window will appear with the VPN app icon and an Applications folder shortcut. Drag the VPN app icon to the Applications folder to install it. This copies the application to your Mac.

macOS may ask you to confirm that you want to open the application from the internet—click ""Open"" to proceed.

# Step 4: Launch and Configure

Open your Applications folder (press Command + Shift + A) and locate your VPN app. Double-click to launch it for the first time.

You may be prompted to grant the VPN app permission to add VPN configurations to your Mac. Click ""Allow"" when prompted—this is necessary for the VPN to function properly.

When we test out VPNs, we always download the VPN's app for macOS onto our testing MacBook, and this is by far the most straightforward method.

# Step 5: Sign In and Connect

Enter your login credentials (email and password) when prompted. Some VPNs also offer sign-in via activation code or magic link sent to your email.

After signing in, you'll see the VPN's main dashboard. Log in, choose a server, and shield your Mac with a VPN.

**Quick Connect**: Click the main ""Connect"" button to automatically connect to the fastest available server.

**Choose Your Location**: Access the server list (usually via a menu or dedicated tab) to select a specific country or city. This is useful for accessing region-specific content or optimizing speed.

# Step 6: Add VPN to Menu Bar (Optional but Recommended)

Most Mac VPN apps can display a small icon in your menu bar (top-right of your screen) for quick access. Look for this option in the app's settings or preferences.

The Mac app has a main window and a Menu bar icon for quick access. This allows you to connect, disconnect, or switch servers without opening the full application.

# Step 7: Verify Connection

Just like on Windows, verify your VPN is working by searching ""what is my IP"" in your browser. Your displayed location should match your selected VPN server location.

**macOS Compatibility Note**: While Surfshark supports macOS 11 and newer, you can still get a legacy app for older macOS versions or set up a VPN with a manual connection. Most premium VPNs maintain compatibility with older Mac systems.

# Using Your VPN: Essential Tips

Now that your VPN is set up, here are some practical tips for getting the most out of it:

# When to Use Your VPN

**Always use your VPN when:**

* Connected to public Wi-Fi networks
* Accessing sensitive information (banking, shopping, work documents)
* Traveling internationally
* Accessing region-restricted content
* Torrenting or downloading large files

You don't necessarily need to connect to your VPN all the time. If you're not traveling, your home network should be secure enough as long as it's password-protected.

# Choosing the Right Server

For everyday browsing and maximum speed, connect to a server in your own country or a nearby location. The closer the server, the faster your connection will typically be.

For accessing region-specific content (like streaming services), connect to a server in the country where that content is available.

# Understanding the Kill Switch

Most premium VPNs include a ""kill switch"" feature. If your VPN connection drops, then the kill switch will shut down all web apps and browsers so your internet service provider can't see any of your online activities.

Enable this feature in your VPN app's settings for maximum protection. It ensures your real IP address is never exposed, even if your VPN connection temporarily fails.

# Enable Auto-Connect

Most VPN apps can automatically connect when you start your laptop or open the app. This feature, available in the settings, ensures you're always protected without having to remember to connect manually.

Connect to a VPN automatically when you launch the NordVPN app or when your Mac starts up.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with user-friendly apps, you might occasionally encounter issues. Here's how to resolve the most common problems:

# VPN Won't Connect

**Try these solutions:**

1. Check your internet connection—disconnect from the VPN and ensure you can browse normally
2. Restart the VPN app completely (quit and relaunch)
3. Turn your Wi-Fi off and on, or unplug and replug your Ethernet cable to ensure a strong Wi-Fi connection
4. Try connecting to a different server location
5. Check if your VPN subscription is active and not expired

# Slow Connection Speeds

VPNs can sometimes reduce your internet speed due to encryption overhead and server distance. To optimize speed:

1. Connect to a server closer to your physical location
2. Try switching to a different server in the same country
3. Switch VPN protocols—WireGuard or Lightway typically offer the fastest speeds
4. Close bandwidth-heavy applications you're not using
5. Restart your router

# VPN Blocks Certain Websites

Some websites detect and block VPN connections. If this happens:

1. Try connecting to a different server in the same country
2. Clear your browser cookies and cache
3. Try the VPN provider's obfuscated or stealth servers (check app settings)
4. Contact your VPN's support team—they often have specialized servers for accessing specific services

# App Crashes or Won't Launch

1. Ensure your operating system is up to date
2. Uninstall and reinstall the VPN app
3. Check if your antivirus software is blocking the VPN
4. Temporarily disable firewalls to test if they're interfering
5. Contact customer support with error messages

Most premium VPNs offer 24/7 live chat support, so don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter persistent issues.

# Conclusion

Setting up and using a VPN on your laptop is simpler than you might think. Whether you're using Windows or Mac, the entire process—from subscribing to connecting—takes less than 10 minutes.

With your VPN now protecting your laptop, you can browse, stream, and work with confidence knowing your data is encrypted and your online activity is private. Remember to keep the VPN connected when using public Wi-Fi or accessing sensitive information.

As cyber threats continue to rise, a VPN is no longer optional—it's essential protection for anyone who values their privacy and security online. The small investment in a quality VPN service pays dividends in peace of mind and digital safety.

1p5mc75,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1p5mc75/trying_to_push_my_circadian_cycle_forward_has/,Trying to push my circadian cycle forward has made my sleep so much worse,"My sleep schedule has usually been pretty consistent. I go to bed between 10-11 and wake up between 5-6. Since July I hit a period of stress between my health and my job and it was affecting my sleep. Ever since daylight savings time ended my waking up has been between 3-4 no matter what time I go to sleep. 

I also get really sleepy between 8-9 on most nights. I could never explain why. Usually I'm watching TV and I have to fight to not fall asleep on the couch, but this also happens if I happen to be out somewhere. It's like my body just releases melatonin no matter what around this time. 

I decided to try and fix this and ChatGPT recommended techniques that I now know are CBT-I. Basically if I wake up in the middle of the night I try to go to sleep for 10-15 minutes. If I can't fall back to sleep, I get out of bed and go read in another room or do some low involvement activity. Once I get sleepy again I go back to bed and try to go back to sleep. 

All this has done is made me anxious about sleeping in bed and I'm unable to fall back to sleep. The past few nights I've gone to bed at my usual bedtime and I wake up between 12-12:30 and I can't fall back to sleep no matter what I do. I get tired because I read until my eyes close and I can't keep my head up, but my body feels all wounds up and on adrenaline and refuses to sleep. It's been really hard to function off of 1-2 hours of sleep these past few days. I've noticed that it's harder for me to fall asleep as well. This never used to be a problem.

What should I do? I've been avoiding naps to keep sleep pressure for nighttime, but what good is it if I can't stay asleep. I kind of want to just fall asleep when the 8PM sleepiness comes in. I'll wake up in the middle of the night, but at least I'll have several hours of sleep instead of 1-2. 

Things I've tried: 

* breathing exercises: doesn't help. I'm stuck in fight or flight.

* meditation: Yoga nidra sometimes helps. I almost fell asleep a few while doing it, but I startled myself awake every time it happened. 

* military relaxation method: didn't help.

* count by 3s, naming animals that start with a certain letter: helped at first, but I'm usually too wound up now. 

I don't drink coffee anymore. I get outside for walks 3x a day. I don't eat for several hours before bed. I take 200mg of Mag Glycinate a few hours before bed. I'll be adding L-theanine soon.

I also made an appointment to see a sleep specialist who is also a pulmonologist. Is this helpful? I'm also open to therapy, but I'm not sure if I should be looking for a psychiatrist or therapist.

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Philadelphia Flyers: A Glacial Showdown with Fireworks**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a game where the Tampa Bay Lightning, armed with star power and a .962 save percentage from Andrei Vasilevskiy, aim to electrocute the Philadelphia Flyers, whose offense plays like a slow cooker set to “simmer” (i.e., *never*). The Flyers, meanwhile, are banking on chaos, a franchise-record 3-goal spree in 26 seconds (a feat that should be patented as “The Philly 30-Second Sprint”), and the hope that Tampa’s defense, currently held together by duct tape and Hedman’s absence, will misfire. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni operator on a coffee high.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Lightning’s Spark vs. Flyers’ Fizzle

The Lightning are favored at **-171 on the moneyline**, implying a **62.5% chance to win** (per the formula: 171/(171+100) = 62.5%). For the Flyers (+142), their **33.3% implied probability** feels generous, given their **30th-ranked offense** (2.8 goals per game) and a defense that’s as leaky as a sieve made of pucks.

The **over/under is 5.5 goals**, with the over priced at **-110** across most books. Both teams average **5.9 goals per game**, so this should be a popcorn contest. But here’s the kicker: Tampa’s **goal differential (+6)** and Kucherov’s **22 points in 21 games** (including 10 goals) make them a scoring machine. The Flyers? They’ve allowed **5.7 goals per game to opponents**—so unless they’re planning to play turtle defense (and even then…), this game could get *messy*.

---

### Injury Report: Tampa’s Defense is a Joke, Philly’s a Mystery

Tampa’s defense is missing **Victor Hedman** (the team’s human wall) and three other blueliners, leaving Vasilevskiy to perform acrobatics worthy of a Cirque du Soleil ice show. Meanwhile, the Flyers are without **Rasmus Ristolainen**, whose absence is less impactful than losing a seat on a crowded subway. Phil

She's been hustling her ass off for years and always struggled until she landed this job. 
We make about $100k but live in a remote area where basic necessities are pretty pricey, especially heat and power, so that $100k doesn't go very far. 
I am comfy enough because my husband also makes low six-figures, but I couldn't survive on my own, so I know things are tight for them still. 

My coworker has been with her boyfriend for 12 years and he has never worked; I have been told this is due to social anxiety. Meanwhile this girl has worked 4-5 jobs her entire working life until recently. 

She does EVERYTHING for this guy. 

She comes home for lunch and he makes puppy dog eyes at her so she'll make him a sandwich; if she didn't make herself coffee in the morning before she leaves, he'll beg her to make him coffee at lunch, too. I don't understand how social anxiety prevents this guy from making himself a sandwich in his own kitchen. 

He does zero housework, he doesn't shovel the driveway, and he does nothing to contribute to the life she's built for them. He does nothing to alleviate her emotional or domestic burden. The guy is a leech.

My coworker always says it's not his fault he has anxiety, and it's not her fault for falling in love with him as a teenager. I always remind her that it's not his fault he has anxiety, but as an adult it *is* his job to seek treatment (which is free for him, btw) and try to better himself. I've also told her that love is a great and powerful thing, but adult relationships are built on partnership and love alone is not enough. 

Today she was talking to me about pension splitting and spousal RRSPs for this guy and my eyes involuntary rolled so far back into my head I could count the ripples on my brain. I asked why she would split her pension when he's literally contributed nothing to their life for 12 years. 

She's ambitious, educated, and feisty. I think she knows she's in a shitty situation but can't let go (this guy just have a magic 🍆 or something). 

I'm trying not to come across as a know-it-all, but I'm genuinely concerned for her and her financial and emotional well-being. 

Anyone have any advice? Or do I just shut up and let him tank her life? ",2,1764002610.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

1p5ly3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1p5ly3n/ovulation/,Ovulation,"Hi y'all 

My question before I type out my vent is: do you experience pain during ovulation, how extreme is it, what do you take, and do you also have endometriosis. 

Vent: I (31F) was diagnosed with PCOS almost two years ago. Since then I have been put on metformin, spironolactone and Lexapro. I have taken birth control my whole life. 

About three months ago I found out I was incorrectly diagnosed with celiac disease and a dairy allergy. I have been gluten free for 14 years, somewhat dairy free (cheese didn't seem to ever bother me). I have been eating gluten and dairy with 0 symptoms for three months, and attributing all of my previous symptoms growing up to the undiagnosed PCOS. 

Since eating gluten again, I have had three periods consistently. Prior to this, I've had three sporadically with starting the meds and prior to that maybe one a year/every two years. The first was 9 days, the second 5, and the third was three or four? It was pretty much just spotting so I'm not really sure. A few days later, I had spotting again. No big deal I thought. Well, I started my ovulation week of my birth control and finally have started feeling what everyone always jokes about during ovulation. The last almost two years, I was kind of miserable and felt discomfort, no want for anything sexual. This week however, I felt feral even though I was spotting quite a bit. Yesterday, I finally needed a panty liner as it had developed into almost full light period which was concerning but read that ovulation bleeding can happen. I went to bed, and woke up more exhausted than I have ever been in my life. I can barely keep my eyes open. I decide to make coffee which I hardly drink, and when I bent down to grab the milk, I felt a crazy pain in my ovaries/general vaginal area, and could barely stand up. 

The pain has gradually gotten worse, and I cannot sit. I can stand, or I can lay down flat but nothing in between. My stomach is crazy swollen, and I am having a hard time using the restroom because it hurts to push. I also got really sweaty and nauseous, and I ended up throwing up once. Since then I have taken a 20mg CBD gummy which seems to have helped but I am still massively uncomfortable, just less pain. 

For context, I have had 3 kidney stones and this experience was way worse than any of those stones. I have also experienced a cyst burst before, but this was also worse, but somewhat similar so wondering if I just  had a cyst burst? Anyway, just curious if anyone else has thing happen to them and how severe it is. I feel like since being on meds for PCOS I have just been in more and more pain. I have gained weight (I was already overweight but have gained 20 lbs since starting meds), I cry alot, and my boobs always hurt. I use the restroom alot more than ever before as well, but my doctor says that is normal. I just feel like I can't even leave my house because my body is always going through something and I hope this isn't just the plight of womanhood coming back to haunt me.

The bag is full-grain leather, structured without being stiff, and actually functional (which isn’t always the case with leather backpacks). It has enough organization for everyday carry without turning into a tactical bag. Laptop sleeve fits a 16” MacBook comfortably, and the padding is legit. The straps break in nicely too no digging into your shoulders.

A few things that stood out:

* The leather quality feels premium for the price — soft but durable.
* Fits work essentials without turning into a bulging brick.
* Minimal branding, clean look, very “grown-up.”
* Works for commuting, coffee shop days, or travel.
* The magnetic closure is solid — doesn’t pop open.

If you like the “elevated minimal” look but don’t want to spend luxury-brand prices, this bag hits the sweet spot. And if you’re eyeing it around Black Friday, [Nisolo's](https://go.shopmy.us/p-32558028) deals get *aggressively* good 40% off early, and up to 75% off sitewide during peak BFCM, which is when the bag becomes an actual steal.

Super functional, premium-feeling, and clean enough to go with anything. It’s one of the better leather commuter bags I’ve tried in the under-$300 category, especially when it’s on sale.",1,1764002471.0,u_Mr_Rellim,0,1.0,False

They tell me my name is John. I think my name is John. I mean, they tell me my name is John, so my name is John. They put me in my own room in the basement and told someone that my name is John, but it's about me so I think they told the person and told me that my name is John.

I don't remember having a mommy tell me my name is John. I think I have a mommy. If I don't have a mommy then that means He is my father and my mother and Jesus is my brother, so I guess I hope I don't have a mother. If I have a mother then I have someone to love, and someone to love me. But I don't remember having a mother so do I love someone? And is there someone that loves me? If He is my father and my mother then He doesn't love me, because he created me and everyone else on Earth and isn't able to feed them all, so He doesn't love them, and He tells them to have me in the basement and I can't see his eye in the sun nor his feeling in the moon so I guess I don't hope that I don't have a mother who loves me. Can I love myself? I hope so because the only one who seems to love me is the Lady in the Yellow Shirt, because she let me have her coffee and her muffin and smiled at me when I smiled at her. I stopped smiling then and she kept smiling, so I smiled again.

The muffin was good but the coffee was bad. I did not like it. I smiled anyway as I sipped it and looked at the Lady in the Yellow Shirt, who was still smiling when she asked me, ""What is your name?"" I kept smiling and told her I don't remember having a mother who loved me and called me anything. She asked me if I had any friends who loved me and called me anything. I told her no and said that whatever friends I did have they wouldn't let me see, because those friends were with me in the woods and they didn't come with me to the basement. I touched the spot where I hurt and she told me not to touch it, so I didn't touch it again.

When she left it felt colder, and I don't like the cold. I wished my friends were here. She told me they were dead but I don't remember them being dead. I don't want them to be dead. They're not dead. I love my friends. Do they love me? If I love them they are not dead. If they love me they are dead, because the Man in the Brown Pants said that they're dead and the Lady in the Yellow Shirt told me they loved me.

The Man in the Brown Pants came in after the Lady in the Yellow Shirt left. Before she left she told me my friends loved me, and he tells me my friends are dead, so if they love me they are dead. I want to reach out to him but he says I can't, and I see I can't. Stupid of me not to not think so. He sits but I don't see a chair. He asks me what my name is. I tell him that I told the Lady in the Yellow Shirt that I don't remember having a mother who called me a name, so I must have no mother and no name. He doesn't have to tell me he's mad. What he tells me is that I am in trouble, and that I am safe until they find out I did it. The Lady in the Yellow Shirt told me if they find out; the Man in the Brown Pants said when they find out. I don't like that. I like not knowing. Except I like knowing if I have someone who loves me and calls me a name.

He stands. I now see the chair. He goes to walk away, and I call out to him if it is daytime or nighttime. He tells me it won't matter and I hear a bang, a bang I don't like but like better than the coffee, and I don't see him again. I ask God if it is night or day but He doesn't speak; it must be night so he can be asleep.

HIM: I don't know he didn't say.

OTHER HIM: and he says he doesn't know so maybe he doesn't know.

HIM: he knows how can he not know.

OTHER HIM: maybe he's scrambled not right in the head maybe from briar hill.

HIM: no my sister says he goes to the same school as my niece but how on god's earth is he in middle school.

OTHER HIM: scrambled not right in the head.

HIM: then he should be at briar hill and not in a school.

OTHER HIM: father easton said nobody should be in that school.

HIM: it's a school we're not teachers and we don't have the dough to jump to another town but someone scrambled as got to still know their own name.

OTHER HIM: ain't many got that thing where they don't grow in their head.

HIM: ain't gonna say ain't ain't ya.

OTHER HIM: sorry.

HIM: grows enough so he knows his own name.

SHE: no i​ knew a girl who was eight and did not know her own name.

HIM: bad parents but a guy scrambled still knows to call himself tim or adam if his momma doesn't give him a name.

SHE: what.

HIM: figure one and two for yourself for once.

SHE: i have and still do not understand.

OTHER HIM: enough do we know what to call him.

HIM: nothing besides a John Doe until we straighten things out.

SHE: why don't you let me talk to him.

HIM: because you were such a help the first time round.

OTHER HIM: let's not let's just call him John Doe for now at least we have the names of the people he was with.

HIM: not the one he must know.

SHE: he says he loves them.

HIM: they wouldn't love him if they still were able to he must know.

OTHER HIM: coroner is in from ephrata in a day we'll know then.

HIM: he's gotta know i know he's gotta know.

OTHER HIM: sheriff we can't do anything right now let's get some sleep.

HIM: you wouldn't have any sleep if you could hold it with your hands.

OTHER HIM: it's something new i hope it works the guy at the drug store gave it to me and said it has some ridiculous success rate.

HIM: all bull don't listen just see for yourself we'll meet in the morning and rebby come too.

SHE: please don't call me that i said it once and will say it again i want to be referred to in a professional manner fitting of my position.

HIM: all bull you're just the judge's nuisance in my back.

SHE: real poetic.

HIM: if i didn't say it already you're dismissed.

OTHER HIM: how long.

HIM: not very long he can hear us the cells are right beneath this office so let's say goodnight John goodnight John.

And then they stopped, and I was John, and my friends loved me but they are dead. I'm John and they're dead.

I’m Lauren and I’m a relative newbie here (mostly I’ve been hanging around the coffee folks). I’m delighted to find you all. I’m the author of queer cult classic novel Kamikaze Lust, which won a 2000 Lambda Literary Award in the small press category.

I think we’d call the book lit-fic by today’s standards, but it’s very indie in spirit, sexy, fun, sad, romantic, and upends expectations of identity, sexuality, family. At the time the New York Blade called it ""the first dynamic lesbian novel of the twenty-first century.”

In her foreword to the 25th Anniversary Edition poet/novelist/essayist Carley Moore says: “If I had to compare Lauren Sanders to other writers and Kamikaze Lust to other books, I’d say Orlando by Virginia Woolf, Zami: A New Spelling of My Name by Audre Lorde, Valencia by Michelle Tea (also getting a reissue this year), Cool for You by Eileen Myles, and Give It to Me by Ana Castillo. All of these books stand a bit outside the LGBTQ canon in their groundbreaking queerness. There’s a willingness in each to explore taboo subjects before they became more mainstream: gender-switching, Black life and sexuality, sex work, the working class and art-making, and Latina(x) divadom. Sanders shares with these authors a kind of audaciousness and verve that makes her a rebel to this day.""

I’m a huge fan of traveling, and I try to explore new places whenever I can. Whether it's a weekend road trip or a more adventurous overseas getaway, I’m always looking for my next destination.

Cooking is another passion of mine—there’s something about trying out new recipes and perfecting a dish that just feels satisfying. Bonus points if you’ve got any killer recipes to share!

I’m also a fan of working out, I used to be a personal trainer and am fortunate enough to have a home gym!

When I’m not in the kitchen or the gym, I’m usually in the garden. There’s something so peaceful and rewarding about growing your own plants and watching them thrive. Whether it’s tending to flowers, herbs, or vegetables, it’s become one of my favorite ways to unwind and get outside

I wake up, make coffee, feed my cat, then sit near my window for like five minutes just watching people rush to the bus stop. It feels like my brain uses that moment to switch modes. I never had anything like this when I used to commute because everything was frantic from the first minute and I was always late or stressed. Now this tiny pause is the calmest part of my day and weirdly it makes me way more focused once I start working.



I am curious if others got their own odd routines since going remote. Not talking about fancy stuff like sunrise yoga or productivity hacks. I mean the small random habits that just appeared out of nowhere and now feel essential to staying sane. Do you have any tiny ritual that became part of your remote life for no real reason?

Nov. 6th, 1983

7:24 A.M.

I don’t notice my eyes drifting closed until the radar jolts me awake again.

“Sixty-eight miles per hour.”

A red sports bike drifts into the horizon. I give it no more attention than a sigh. I’m not awake enough to chase down some kid going thirteen over. Not that I’d even catch him. We have a no-chase policy—specifically for those types of bikes. It gets too dangerous for civilians if they decide to run.

Anyone reading this would probably think I’m one of those lazy cops. Not the case. It’s just a rough morning. The warm cup of coffee in my lap is too soothing, begging me to lean back and close my eyes.

But I’m disrupted again.

Another cruiser pulls up beside my window and gives me a courtesy blip of the siren.

I lift my head to see Marco leaning over his steering wheel, trying to get my attention. I roll the window down, ready for a round of shit-talking. Instead, he looks confused.

“Hey, you get a call on the handset?”

I look down at the carphone. The LED is still solid red.

“Nothing. Why?”

“They been telling us to go set up at Wexler Labs. Full roadblock, I guess.”

“Hm. I haven’t heard—”

I’m cut off by the walkie on my chest crackling to life with Susan’s voice:

“All units, please be advised. Ten-thirty-three at Wexler Ave. Intersection 143 to be closed down. You’ll receive a call if you’re actively needed at the scene. All other units return to the precinct ASAP.”

I glance at Marco. He shrugs.

“Fuckin’ weird,” he mutters. “Well, sounds like I’m going to set up. I’ll find out what I can.” He starts to pull away.

“By the way, I wasn’t sleeping! Just closed my eyes!” I shout.

He waves a hand dismissively.

The last time we were all called back to the precinct was during the flood, when we had to work with the National Guard. With how quiet the morning’s been, I get a strange feeling.

I buckle up and whip a U-turn.

A fire truck with sirens blazing tears past me in the opposite lane, heading toward Marco. Probably a multi-car accident, I think. But then more lights follow. Fire truck. Ambulance. Another ambulance.

Then something stranger—

A line of large black SUVs. Windows tinted. Government-looking.

“The fuck?”

I turn my head as they pass, trying to catch markings. Nothing.

I grab the handset and call in. The line barely rings.

“Dispatch.”

“Susan, it’s James. What the hell’s going on?”

“Uhm… uh—”

She sounds like she’s juggling paperwork. Phones ring nonstop behind her.

“I’m sorry, James. I’m not really sure. You should be heading back to the office.”

“Yeah, I heard. I am. So was there a big accident or something?”

“I really can’t say. I don’t know either. Just taking orders. Head back and they’ll fill you in.”

The precinct comes into view, surrounded by squad cars. I get out in step with another officer—a new guy I’ve seen around.

“Hey, pretty interesting first week, eh?” I say.

“Yeah, not so bad. You know what this is about?” His voice is young. Reminds me of my boy.

“You know as much as I do, bud. Probably a safety briefing or something,” I reassure him.

Inside, the stuffy, brightly lit room looks thrown together, with chairs still stacked along the walls. Everyone packs in tight, the air buzzing with low murmuring.

A head pops up near the front—Commissioner Harrison. I hear his voice before I see him. He’s standing on a chair.

“Listen up! Everyone who isn’t here is responding to the traffic block at Wexler Ave. We’re also working with other officials to block off the Wexler Corporation property.”

A voice from the back calls out, “This a terrorist attack?”

A few chuckles.

“No! Nobody’s saying that right now. Now listen. We’ve been tasked with setting up a perimeter within a ten-mile radius of the Wexler site. That means evacuating every single person in that radius.”

The crowd groans.

“This is a big operation, I understand. Lincoln Park, Mathers, and other high schools have provided buses that are currently en route and ready for passengers.”

Another voice shouts:

“Where are we gonna put all these people? You’re talking thousands.”

The room erupts in uneasy conversation. Harrison raises his voice.

“There is a designated receiving point already being set up. Now, I don’t know what the situation is, but it’s enough of a concern that the National Guard has been deployed. We’ll be working around the clock with neighboring counties.”

Unease twists in my stomach. If it’s not a terrorist attack, then it feels like something worse.

The rookie next to me folds his arms, looking like a lost puppy.

“Form lines at the front and grab a packet. The post-it color tells you your group. Times, locations, instructions—all inside. Report to your commanding officer at your site.”

We shuffle forward as confusion grows and the promise of a long night settles in.

“So, anything I should load in my cruiser?” the rookie asks.

“Make sure your traffic-safety stuff’s in there. Other than that, couldn’t tell ya.”

I watch the stack of packets shrink. Then it hits me like a gut punch—

my house.

It’s in the ten-mile radius.

I push forward, grab two packets, hand one to the rookie.

“Let’s go,” I say.

We head out into city streets now flooded with sirens.

I pack my things into my car and see the rookie nervously flipping through his packet. I pause before shutting my door.

“Hey—get in. You’re with me.”

He looks relieved and hurries into the passenger seat.

“You sure I’m supposed to ride with you?”

I pull a cigarette from my breast pocket and stick it between my lips.

“Your packet’s got a green stamp, right?”

He rifles through the papers.

“Uh… yeah. Yeah, it does.”

“Okay, so you’re with me.”

I slam the car into reverse and peel out. The rookie grabs the ceiling handle.

“Where are we going?” he asks, fumbling with his seatbelt.

“My family. We live on Jackson. Gonna make sure my wife gets out.”

“Okay, but aren’t we supposed to go—”

I cut him off.

“You ask too many questions. Just keep up.”

“Got it,” he snaps back.

With sirens blazing, we race down the street, dodging traffic and cutting corners.

I pick up the handset and dial home.

The phone rings too long.

“C’mon, Cheryl. Pick up.”

“You’ve reached the Nolan residence. Sorry, we’re—”

I slam the phone down.

“Fuck,” I mutter.

Evacuees fill the sidewalks. Luggage dragging behind them like it’s an airport on Thanksgiving.

Rookie stares into the dash, pale.

“You good?” I ask.

“My brother. Eddie. He works night shift at Wexler. He’s there right now.”

The dread in his voice hits me. I’ve never been one to offer false comfort—but I do it anyway.

“After I get my wife, we’ll go for your brother. Understand?”

He nods.

Jackson Street is lined with school buses. Families spill out of houses, kids still in pajamas. I spot my wife’s car.

“Wait here,” I tell Rookie, jumping out.

Cheryl meets me at the door the second I touch the knob.

“Honey!”

Inside, grocery sacks sit piled in the hallway.

“Where’re the kids?”

“Upstairs getting dressed. James, can you tell me what the hell is happening?”

“I don’t know. Something at Wexler. They’re evacuating ten miles.”

“Jesus… Are we safe?”

“Cheryl, I don’t know.” I yell upstairs: “Coats! Let’s go, move!”

In the closet I grab the old nine-millimeter and shove it into a bag with ammo.

“What the hell is that for?” she asks.

“Precaution. You know how to use it.”

Rookie bursts through the door.

“Nolan!” he shouts.

I turn. “What?”

“They got synthetics on the streets. People are gettin’ rowdy.”

I push past him to the doorway. White trucks unload S.H.R reps. A man shoves one.

“Get your fuckin’ hands off me, meat bag!”

Crowds yell as they’re corralled toward buses.

One of the synths turns toward our house and starts up the steps, moving stiff and casual at the same time.

I block the doorway. “Fuck off. Police business!”

She doesn’t react.

“Cheryl Nolan and family must proceed to Bus Three at this time.”

I get in her face. “She’s not going anywhere. I’m handling this as a Cook County officer—”

“James,” she interrupts flatly, “I must urge you to follow protocols.”

I slam the door. Her shadow stays behind the hazy glass.

“What the shit?” one of the kids whispers.

“Language.”

I grab Cheryl’s arm gently. “If they’re using S.H.R reps, it means they’re not willing to put real people out here.”

“What does that mean?” she asks, voice shaking.

“Means they don’t think it’s safe.”

We slip out the back. Kids stumble with their bags, hair messy from sleep. In the garage, the station wagon waits. I grip Cheryl’s shoulders.

“Go north. To my parents. Don’t stop for anyone.”

Her eyes well.

“James…”

I kiss her forehead and breathe in the familiar scent of her perfume.

“We’re gonna be fine. Take care of them. I’ll call when I can.”

Rookie loads the last bags and looks to me. 

“Get in.  Go with them. I’ll find Eddie.” I say.  He follows my orders.

I kneel by the back window and take my daughter’s hand. I smile, then look to her brother.

“You take care of your sister, Morgan.”

He nods, serious.

I meet Rookie’s eyes: Don’t fuck up.

He gives a stiff, silent nod.

I watch the wagon roll down the alley until exhaust swallows it.  I’m left with the echoes of chaos and sirens all around me.

No extreme weather (too much sun or too cold) occurred, I’m in Italy so it’s almost winter now).
It stayed in the bathroom (first location pic) for the first month but I thought it got too much direct sunlight in the afternoon) and it would get too cold later so I moved it in the living room (second location pic) with more indirect sunlight and warmer setting.

It started pretty soon to show distress symptoms: I had to cut (sterile scissors) a total of 6 stems which looked rotten and another one was easily pulled out, dead.
The other ones are getting “wooden” but maybe it is normal?
I see no parasites.

I watered with tap water but I read on here today that maybe demineralised water would be better.
I attached a few pics, what did I do wrong so far and what can I do now?
I know it is VERY thirsty but I wanted to hear from y’all first (also I am a too much caring plant owner and I don’t want to drown it)

1p5lncg,https://i.redd.it/nrnn1bdab83g1.jpeg,"My debut contemporary harem novel, Breakwater Bound, is out now!","Hi! I'm Kaylee!

I wrote a book. It's about a man having to return home to his small-town life in coastal Oregon after his mother suffers a stroke. Set in Breakwater Bay, a town I made up that isn't just Depoe Bay, our guy Luke has to restore the family marina or sell it to developers. There are folks in town willing to help him, including blasts from his past (his highschool sweetheart turned mom's doctor, Claire, and his male ex-best-friend turned mechanic, Jonah) and some new faces (the local roastery/coffee shop owner, Faith; a dockmaster who worked closely with his father, Tessa; and a bartender who can bring the town together in a flash, Sav). If only he'll stay and accept their help.

It's explicit, with no F/F in the series. I know that's a dealbreaker for some, and to that I say you should check out JT Knight's Side-by-Side or Michael Dalton's Bikini Days series instead!

I had a lot of fun writing this book, and I hope you have fun reading it!

I'll drop some links and the re-written blurb (thanks for your help!) below:

**They watched him leave once. Now they'll see what makes him stay.**

Luke Adams escaped Breakwater Bay, Oregon, twelve years ago to avoid **choosing between love and freedom**. Now his mother's stroke drags him home to find his family's legacy—Adams Marina—weeks from permanent closure.

He's got days to fix the marina up so it can pass inspection. Tens of thousands in debt with no available funding. Environmental red tape that could stall him for months. The smart move is selling to developers and walking away clean.

But the marina isn't all **he's fighting for**. Faith makes the impossible feel achievable, one coffee at a time. Sav rallies the entire town behind him. Tessa teaches him to work with the system instead of against it. Even Claire, the ex who has every reason to hate him, is willing to give him a second chance. They're not just helping him save the marina; they're the reason he wants to.

Luke is done choosing between people. He wants **all of them**, and he's building a life that doesn't force him to pick.

I’ve always wanted a core group of friends where I feel included, wanted, and part of something real. But most of my friendships have felt seasonal, temporary, or one-sided. Even as an adult, I still feel like I’m always on the outside looking in.

I’m a bubbly, quirky, outgoing, friendly person — the type who will dance in public if a song hits or make a TikTok on the spot. I love spontaneous adventures just as much as cozy coffee dates. I have friends, but they all fall into categories, and I’ve never had that small, consistent group that shares similar personalities, effort, or energy.

Recently I opened up about this to two newer friends who understood how I felt about always being the planner and the one who checks in. It was validating and made me hopeful… but I’ve had so many temporary friendships that it’s hard to trust things until I see the effort consistently. I do have one amazing best friend who always shows up for me, but I guess I’ve always wished for a group, not just one person.

I also know I’m not perfect — I can be bold, opinionated, or jump into problem-solving instead of just listening. I’m working on that. I’ve realized not everyone wants advice; sometimes they just need a friend who listens.

But I don’t think what I want is unreasonable. I just want a small circle where the effort goes both ways, where I’m not always the one initiating, and where I’m not the last one chosen simply because I’m “what’s left.” I’ve had friendships especially in groups where people left me out, stopped answering when they hung out without me when we all
Planned to hang together in the first place or didn’t show up for my birthday when I always showed up for theirs. It really sticks with you.

I’ve cried a lot these past couple weeks because this feeling goes back to elementary school — always trying, always hoping, always wanting to feel like someone’s first choice for once.

So… has anyone else felt this way?

I’m the author of queer cult classic novel Kamikaze Lust, which won a 2000 Lambda Literary Award in the small press category.

I think we’d call the book lit-fic by today’s standards, but it’s very indie in spirit, sexy, fun, sad, romantic, and upends expectations of identity, sexuality, family. At the time the New York Blade called it ""the first dynamic lesbian novel of the twenty-first century.”

In her foreword to the 25th Anniversary Edition poet/novelist/essayist Carley Moore says: “If I had to compare Lauren Sanders to other writers and Kamikaze Lust to other books, I’d say Orlando by Virginia Woolf, Zami: A New Spelling of My Name by Audre Lorde, Valencia by Michelle Tea (also getting a reissue this year), Cool for You by Eileen Myles, and Give It to Me by Ana Castillo. All of these books stand a bit outside the LGBTQ canon in their groundbreaking queerness. There’s a willingness in each to explore taboo subjects before they became more mainstream: gender-switching, Black life and sexuality, sex work, the working class and art-making, and Latina(x) divadom. Sanders shares with these authors a kind of audaciousness and verve that makes her a rebel to this day.""

Challenge 2: Cross the road near HUDA without becoming a speed bump.

Gurgaon rents are so high I’m convinced the buildings have some invisible helipad, which i don't get to use.

Challenge 4: Order food without Zomato asking, “Same order again, lonely sir?”

Challenge 5: Survive office.
Gurgaon offices are like:
• Free coffee
• Free AC
• Free trauma
• Unlimited existential crisis

Challenge 6: Deal with your lift.
My lift stops at every floor except mine. I think it hates me personally.

Challenge 7: Weekends.
Everyone is in CyberHub holding hands.
I’m in my room holding a plate of Maggi.

**Picks (3/4)**

\-SEA Seahawks v TEN Titans Over 41.0 (-110) ✅

\-LA Rams -7.0 (-110) ✅

\-JAX Jaguars v ARI Cardinals Over 47.0 (-110) ✅

**Player Props (3/5)** 

 

\-SEA Seahawks v TEN Titans: Jaxon Smith-Njigba Over 97.5 Receiving Yards (-110) ✅

\-NE Patriots v CIN Bengals: Drake Maye Over 256.5 Passing Yards (-110) ✅

\-NY Giants v DET Lions: Amon-Ra St. Brown Anytime TD (-125) ✅

\-ATL Falcons v NO Saints: Bijan Robinson 2 Or More TDs (+325) ❌

\-TB Buccaneers v LA Rams: Puka Nacua Anytime TD (-120) ❌

 

\----

 

I will say, **I'm a little surprised that the Seahawks blew the spread in the last 5 minutes of yesterday's game** against the Titans (I've never been so happy I didn't make the double digit spread POTD...). I *fully* expected Seattle to cover given how much of a juggernaut their offense has been and how absolutely terrible the Titans have been 😂

 

**Speaking of** ***Pick of the Day*****, shoutout to the Arizona Cardinals for getting into FG range** and NOT missing the FG! I think their kicker was 1 for 3 prior to making that kick, so the result very easily could've gone the other way 😮‍💨 Thank the sports betting Gods it didn't, and we got our bag of money 😆

1p5li97,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreatorsAdvice/comments/1p5li97/what_i_learned_after_10_content_collaborations/,What I learned after 10+ content collaborations,"Hey everyone 👋

I've been doing content collabs for more than 2 years now and wanted to share what I wish someone told me on day one. This got long, but hopefully it helps someone avoid my mistakes!

**BEFORE THE CO-PRODUCTION:**

**Always video call first** (or meet in public)

**Discuss boundaries explicitly**

**Verify their socials are legit**

**Agree on content split BEFORE shooting**

**DURING THE CO-PRODUCTION:**

**Have a simple agreement (even if just via DM)**

I use a basic template covering: 

* Content ownership (we each own our footage)
* Posting schedule
* Editing rights
* What if one person wants to delete later?

**Shoot MORE than you need**

**Check in during the shoot**

**AFTER THE CO-PRODUCTION:**

**Edit & share promptly**

* Don't ghost after the shoot (surprisingly common)
* Share rough cuts for approval
* Stick to your agreed timeline

**Promote each other's content**

**Stay in touch**

**RED FLAGS (RUN AWAY):**

🚩 Won't verify their identity  
🚩 Pushes boundaries during initial convo  
🚩 Bad-mouths other creators constantly  
🚩 Wants to meet immediately (no planning)  
🚩 Unclear about content ownership  
🚩Asks you to pay THEM for the production  
🚩 No social media presence (or brand new accounts)  
🚩 Won't discuss STI testing (if applicable)

**MY BIGGEST MISTAKES:**

* Not having clear agreements (led to content disputes)
* Collaborating with someone just because they had high follower count (terrible chemistry, content flopped)
* Not discussing editing rights (they posted unflattering content of me)
* Assuming ""50/50"" meant the same thing to both of us

**WHAT WORKED BEST:**

✅ Collabs with people in similar niches (even if smaller following)  
✅ Meeting in same city > flying someone out (less pressure)  
✅ Coffee/lunch before shoot (build rapport first)  
✅ Having a shot list (but being flexible)  
✅ Treating it like a professional shoot (on time, prepared, respectful)

**QUESTIONS I ALWAYS ASK BEFORE COMMITTING:**

1. ""What's your vision for this content?""
2. ""Have you collaborated before? How'd it go?""
3. ""What are your hard boundaries?""
4. ""When are you thinking we'd shoot and post?""
5. ""How do you typically split content?""

**MY CURRENT CO-PRODUCTION PROCESS:**

1. Initial DM (vibe check)
2. Video call (verify + discuss ideas)
3. Send simple agreement template
4. Meet for coffee/lunch day before shoot
5. Shoot content
6. Edit & share for approval
7. Post according to schedule
8. Promote each other

If you aren't familiar with why you are chronically sick with SIBO, let me break it down simply so that you can apply this better and hopefully cure yourself. You don't need anything fancy for it either. 

\#1 reason is that your small/large intestine is TOO SLOW, resulting in fecal matter either blocking or sitting in your small bowel, which acts as a base for bacteria to grow. 

People often confuse this with biofilms, when in reality there are literal pieces of poop in their small intestine/stomach because the bacteria is actively fermenting any food you consume and prematurely turning it to fecal matter. Your body then absorbs this as well as the fermentable products (d lactate etc) which makes you feel extremely ill (d lactic acidosis). 

Because of the premature fermentation, this matter also becomes harder, less water absorbant, and therefor much more difficult to pass, which is why so many SIBO symptoms create feedback loops and are very difficult to pinpoint as either a symptom or a reason for the illness. 

ANTIBIOTICS/ANTIMICROBIALS BY THEMSELVES WILL NOT SOLVE THIS. 

You need to realize that your situation is likely unique to yourself, but you should ALWAYS apply the most basic and important steps to treatment: 

Do gut ""resets"". This is when you can confidently say you have properly expelled 99% of the waste in your body, either by taking a powerful laxative or, if you respond well to it, eat something like an extremely spicy pepper/hotsauce. It will clear you right out. Both of these things however become less effective over time, so do so sparingly. 

Even after you have ""reset"" your gut, bacteria will remain in your small intestine. If you are not feeling the ""gurgling"" of your Migratory Motor Complex (you definitely should if you ate a spicy pepper and have no tolerance), it means bacteria will continue to grow if you start eating again, and you will be back to square 1. 

Sometimes the bacteria itself can disable the MMC, which is why you would want to apply your antibiotics/antimicrobials at this stage of treatment. What personally worked for me was 200ml of vodka all at once followed by walking/running, so that your abdominals  push it down the intestine rather than slowly absorbed at the top. This will kill a large amount of the bacteria and is easily accessible/less harmful than antibiotics, which would potentially do more damage to the large colons microbiome.  

Ironically however, being drunk can also impair the MMC, which is why I would also fast/only drink water for this entire day. The next day you will probably wake up with a rumbling tummy which is GOOD because it means your MMC is working. At this point you can eat literally anything and feel amazing again, but you need to resist that and stick to the plan. Once you start feeling good again its very difficult not to just start eating EVERYTHING but once you do you will get sick again, and will have to start all over again. 

After this, eat 2 low fodmap meals, breakfast and lunch. This will give your body ample time to digest them properly (since there wont be any bacteria to ferment it) and you should have a much better bowel movement the next day. Simply set a time limit for yourself when eating, e.g ""I cant eat anything past 5pm"". This works great and you will have a good bowel movement every morning which is key to solving motility. Literally repeat this until you have a schedule that works for yourself, and you should eventually be able to eat ANYTHING you want without intolerance (if you only have SIBO). 

Take note of every variable- wake up, try something, write it down, write the next days result, try something new, etc. If you aren't doing this its easy to get lost. 

Ensure you employ prokenetics in the morning, whether it be ginger tea, coffee, diet soda, hot sauce on your eggs. It all works once you are in the correct stage of treatment. 

Wish you guys the best of luck. Dms are open if you have questions. Ill also respond in the comments.

That gives me the impression that you only get 2 oz of coffee concentrate from a batch. But that doesn't sound right. How much concentrate do you get from a batch using their instructions?",1,1764001339.0,OXORapidBrewer,5,0.6,False
