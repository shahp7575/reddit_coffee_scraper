I thought I was doing okay‚Äîtracking spending in spreadsheets, trying different apps‚Äîbut I kept wondering *‚Äúhow much is this really pushing back my freedom date?‚Äù*

So I started building a simple calculator that shows:

* Your projected ‚ÄúFreedom Year‚Äù (when you could hit FI).
* How small recurring costs (subscriptions, daily habits) actually shift that year.

When I plugged in my own numbers, I realized my random little indulgences (coffee + duplicate streaming subs) were costing me **3‚Äì4 years of freedom** ü§Ø. That was the slap in the face I needed.

I ended up making the calculator free to use because I figured other FIRE folks might find it helpful too. Here it is if you want to play with it: https://theneedless.com/retirement-calculator.

Alt text: Businesspeople in formal meeting, reflecting Bahrain‚Äôs corporate environment.]. Reuters' latest figures paint an equally strong picture: GDP growth in Q1 2025 reached 4.2%, driven by new fintech investors and business-friendly reforms. This is not just marketing‚Äîthese numbers match what I see every day with clients opening operations from Manama to the Free Zones.\
So, which banks should you trust for your corporate account, and how do you cut through red tape? Below is my complete field-tested roadmap‚Äîno fluff, just actionable details.\
(Naturally, you'll want to compare this with the official Bahrain company formation process as a starting point.)\
\
Why Bahrain? Strong Economic Growth and a World-Class Banking Hub\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district skyline., from 2024 to mid-2025, over 1,800 new businesses registered, with nearly 80% foreign-owned, thanks to the government‚Äôs progressive 99% ownership policy (see full breakdown). The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) and Tamkeen have poured millions into digitalization and fintech, making compliance smarter and smoother.\
Key 2025 stats for entrepreneurs:\
- Average corporate account approval time: 7‚Äì14 days (down from 25+ days in 2023)\
- Company formation growth rate: 11.8% YoY (Bahrain.com)\
- Banking sector health: 180+ local/international branches, zero-cash barrier for expat business accounts\
Unlike the UAE, where local sponsorship headaches persist, or Saudi Arabia‚Äôs opaque processes, Bahrain‚Äôs real edge is its transparency and speed‚Äîespecially for 100% foreign-owned firms (details).\
\
Types of Companies and Their Bank Account Requirements\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, team reviewing business plans.: Easiest pathway for SMEs, tech, and consultancies.\
- SPC (Single Person Company): Ideal for solopreneurs and freelancers.\
- BSC-Closed (Bahraini Shareholding Closed Company): Required for larger investors and regulated sectors.\
- Branch of Foreign Company**: Extra steps due to MOICT & EDB checks.\
You must have your Sijilat commercial registration in hand first (registration tips here). Local sponsors are no longer mandatory‚Äîbut some banks frown on companies formed 100% virtually, so having a real local office still helps.\

\
The Best Banks for Corporate Accounts in Bahrain (2025)\
1. Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait (BBK)\
BBK remains the go-to for most new firms, especially those operating in the Seef or Diplomatic Area. Why? BBK pairs English-speaking concierge service with online portals, and their new 2025 ‚ÄúInstant Corporate Onboarding‚Äù desks at Bahrain Bay branch slashed my last account approval to under 5 days‚Äîa major win versus other banks.\
Best for: Tech, trading, consulting, and retail firms needing fast setup and multi-currency options.\
2. Ahli United Bank (AUB)\
AUB is known for its strong SME division, responsive relationship managers, and deep connections with Tamkeen financing. Their Diplomatic Area branch is less crowded‚Äîapply first thing Sunday morning to minimize processing time.\
Best for: Startups, local subsidiaries, and those seeking access to Bahraini and GCC financing.\
3. Gulf International Bank (GIB)\
GIB offers digital-first onboarding for foreign-owned firms and strong compliance for regulated sectors. Their digital ‚ÄúGIB Direct‚Äù service has made it easier for remote owners to monitor accounts and process cross-border payments‚Äîcritical for fintech and e-commerce.\
Best for: Fintech, trade, and companies needing international payment solutions.\
4. National Bank of Bahrain (NBB)\
NBB combines wide local branch coverage (ideal if your business is based in Isa Town, Riffa, or Hidd) with highly-rated Arabic/English support and a new ‚ÄúSME Fast Track‚Äù lane (added Q2 2025).\
Best for: F&B, construction, and firms with mixed Bahraini/expat ownership.\
5. Bahrain Islamic Bank (BisB)\
BisB‚Äôs Sharia-compliant accounts are fast-growing with digital onboarding. If you need Islamic banking or cross-GCC halal finance, BisB delivers‚Äîjust prepare for slightly more documentation.\
Best for: Sharia-compliant businesses and regional traders.\
\
\
My favorite experience: BBK's Bahrain Bay branch has a dedicated VIP room for new business clients, where I enjoyed a majlis-style onboarding‚Äîstrong coffee, networking with other founders, and no queues. (Just don‚Äôt visit on a Thursday at noon during Ramadan‚Äîlearned that one the hard way!)\
\
\
Step-By-Step: How to Open a Corporate Account in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: paperwork and meeting.**\
You‚Äôll need:\
- Sijilat CR copy and MOICT approval (original + stamp)\
- Company memorandum/articles (in Arabic + English)\
- Shareholder passports, Bahrain IDs\
- Lease agreement for a real Bahrain office (virtual offices rarely work)\
- LMRA registration (if hiring staff)\
- Board resolution authorizing account opening\
- Proof of source of funds (recent 2025 rules‚Äîsee below)\
Insider Tip: Have all documents pre-stamped by MOICT and scanned as PDFs‚Äîbanks now accept digital uploads. Save time by booking document legalization appointments online (MOICT‚Äôs new portal is a game-changer).\
2. Choose the Right Branch\
Apply at business-focused branches (e.g., BBK Bahrain Bay, AUB Diplomatic Area). Avoid airport or shopping mall branches‚Äîthey‚Äôre swamped with retail customers.\
3. Book a Meeting Early in the Week\
Sunday mornings (before 10:30am) see the fastest processing and friendliest staff. Avoid pre-holidays, Ramadan peak hours, or midday Thursdays.\
4. Attend the KYC Interview\
Prepare concise answers about your business plan, expected turnover, and the origin of your company funds. Bahrain banks take anti-money laundering checks seriously (2025 regulations require more detail for overseas transfers above BHD 10,000).\
5. Follow Up and Finalize\
Bank admin will issue an account number, then activate online banking. This usually wraps up in 5‚Äì10 business days, but can stretch if documents are incomplete or if you choose a branch outside the city center.\
\
Cost Considerations: Fees, Minimum Balances, and Budgeting\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: calculator, business finance, and money documents.\
- Monthly maintenance: BHD 10‚Äì25 (waived with higher balances‚Äîcheck your sector)\
- Minimum balance: BHD 500‚Äì2,000 depending on bank/plan\
- Account opening fees: BHD 0‚Äì50 (some banks waive for new startups)\
For the latest breakdown, check this resource: Bahrain company formation cost.\
Budget tip: Negotiate fee waivers if you‚Äôre part of a Tamkeen startup program or opening multiple sub-accounts.\
\
Regulatory and Compliance Updates for 2025\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: reviewing legal paperwork. began enforcing enhanced KYC requirements:\
- All beneficial owners must provide tax residency and source-of-funds documentation.\
- Real office lease contracts are now mandatory for all non-free zone businesses.\
- Digital onboarding is only allowed for businesses with Bahraini directors or a local authorized signatory.\
If you‚Äôre using an accountant or service provider, make sure they‚Äôre familiar with Bahrain‚Äôs current compliance rules.\
Common pitfall: Many founders submit incomplete shareholder paperwork‚Äîthe number one cause of delayed account setups. Always print and stamp all pages, not just the signature page, and bring multiple originals.\
\
Bahrain Free Zones: Special Advantages\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Free Zone business district. offer:\
- Easier account setup with fewer local address requirements\
- Tax incentives and customs breaks\
- Streamlined landlord sponsorship for foreign owners\
See free zone benefits here.\
But, free zone banks can be pickier about business activities‚Äîso always clarify your sector with both your agent and the bank up front.\
\
Local Sponsorship and Business Culture: What to Expect\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: customer service in Bahrain bank. can help you with introductions and smooth out any regulatory misunderstandings. It‚Äôs not unusual for a bank manager to request a brief majlis-style chat‚Äîdon‚Äôt skip the traditional coffee, and be ready to discuss long-term business intentions.\
For nuanced sponsorship guidance, see this analysis.\
\
Tangent: Bahrain‚Äôs Ramadan Business Customs‚ÄîAnd Their Impact\
One year, I made the rookie mistake of scheduling a critical banking appointment midway through Ramadan, just after afternoon prayers. The branch was open, but staff were offsite for iftar, and every business leader seemed to be in a neighboring majlis. That delay cost me two full days. Lesson learned: always confirm actual working hours during Ramadan and national holidays‚Äîthey shift more than you‚Äôd think, and business flows at a different rhythm.\
This cultural awareness is more than a curiosity‚Äîit‚Äôs vital for smooth banking and regulatory progress.\
\
Insider Tips and Mistakes to Avoid\
\
Always book bank appointments in central Manama branches. Outlying branches may not process foreign company accounts.\
Don‚Äôt bring photocopies only‚ÄîBahraini banks crave stamped originals.\
Office location matters‚ÄîSeef and Bahrain Bay receive VIP processing; Isa Town and Salmabad branches can be slower.\
Check your company name matches exactly across all documents‚ÄîMOICT is unforgiving about typos.\
Have your accountant check annual accounting and VAT requirements (see details), to avoid fines.\
\
\
FAQ: Opening Corporate Accounts in Bahrain\
Q1: Can I open a Bahrain corporate account remotely, as a foreigner?\
A: Partially. Some banks (GIB, AUB) allow initial document submission online, but you or your local authorized signatory must visit the branch for KYC. Best results come with a Bahraini office lease and local contact. More on company formation for foreigners here.\
Q2: What‚Äôs the fastest way to open an account for a new company?\
A: Choose a central Manama branch (BBK, GIB, or AUB), prep all MOICT-stamped docs in advance, and schedule your appointment Sunday AM. Free zone companies may see faster approvals.\
Q3: What banking fees should I budget for in 2025?\
A: Expect BHD 100‚Äì2,000 minimum deposit, BHD 10‚Äì25 monthly fees for basic accounts. See a full cost and fee breakdown.\
Q4: Do Bahrain banks require local shareholders?\
A: No, most banks support 100% foreign-owned companies‚Äîbut having a Bahrain-resident authorized signatory speeds things up. Check current ownership rules.\
Q5: What is the biggest mistake new founders make?\
A: Submitting incomplete or inconsistent company documents, not checking Ramadan or holiday schedules, and under-budgeting for account minimums. Detailed process info lives here: company formation process guide.\

1mrqvvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mrqvvy/my_hearts_on_the_left_side_of_my_body_why_am_i/,"My heart‚Äôs on the left side of my body, why am I the crazy one?","
There‚Äôs no rational way to start this, so I‚Äôll just start from the beginning and try my best to make you understand where I‚Äôm coming from. Please, if there‚Äôs anyone who doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy, please reach out, please tell me I‚Äôm sane and the whole world‚Äôs crazy, please.

My name is Martin Alberstran. I turn 54 in October, and last week I had a heart attack. I guess that‚Äôs where I should start, the day of the heart attack. I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt like to hear about my riveting career as a Postal Clerk at a mid-sized processing facility, or about my kids who seem to have lost my cell number, or my wife, who has felt like a sister rather than a partner for the last 15-ish years. I bore even myself with my life; God knows what it would do to you people.

It was 8:15 in the morning, the same time I‚Äôve woken up every day for the last 30 years. I‚Äôd seen that clock on my bedside table reading ‚Äú8:15‚Äú more than I think I had seen my children‚Äôs faces. Most people just feel dread about something like that; I don‚Äôt. I see dependability, I see something that‚Äôs unchanging. Every day, anything can be different, anything could change, but not that clock, not time. I woke up and grabbed the robe my wife laid out on the foot of our bed, I lazily slung my arms into the sleeves and tied the sash around my waist.

As I walked downstairs, I smelled fresh coffee and bacon. Doctors have been telling me to lower my cholesterol, but I always told my wife, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather die with a steak in my mouth than live with chickpeas and lentils.‚Äù That‚Äôs more or less what happened that morning.

It starts like indigestion, a dull pressure in the chest. But it grows heavier, like an anvil crushing you from the inside. The pain spreads to your arm, your jaw, hot and sharp, while sweat pours down your skin.

You can‚Äôt catch your breath. Your heart stutters, misfires, and it‚Äôs after all this that it hits you that something is terribly wrong. The room blurs, sound fades, and you clutch at your chest, struck by a terrifying certainty that your own body has turned against you.

My wife started dialing 911 the moment I hit the ground; I remember resenting her for not dialing sooner. I don‚Äôt remember much after it, not coherently enough to transcribe it at least. I remember paramedics, vaguely being hauled onto a stretcher, and the hospital lights moving quickly in and out of my perception as I was hurried into a room I couldn‚Äôt name. Machines beeped insistently, hands touched me, voices spoke too quickly, too urgently. I tried to answer, tried to speak, but all that came out was a garbled rasp.

Once I was stable and of conscious mind, a doctor made his way into the room to give me the rundown. He tells me the basics: that they caught it in time, that I‚Äôm stable, and I need to be monitored closely for the next couple of days.

The days went by staying in the hospital. My wife and I didn‚Äôt talk a lot, but she never left my side. If the roles were reversed, I would‚Äôve never left hers. A lot was wrong with our marriage, but our attachment to each other was never one of them. She was there just as my heart was in my chest.

The doctor came in and greeted me and my wife. He asked a few questions, told me that I‚Äôm about good to go and just had a few more boxes to check off. He turned his attention away from me and began speaking to his nurses. He turned back to me and requested an X-ray of my heart. I, of course, obliged and had the X-ray taken. As I was waiting for the results, my wife was grabbing my hand tightly. It felt foreign, but I welcomed it. I don‚Äôt know if she was just doing it to offer support or if she might‚Äôve thought she lost me and was grateful I‚Äôm not dead. I‚Äôd like to think the latter. We‚Äôd been in a romantic-less relationship for as long as we had been romantic, but I remember how we used to be; it was nice to remember. Maybe if things hadn‚Äôt turned out how they did that day, we might‚Äôve finally addressed things and repaired our broken marriage.

Suddenly, I feel her grip tighten up. I turn my head to look at her face, and she‚Äôs mortified. I ask her what‚Äôs wrong, and she doesn‚Äôt reply. I follow her eyes and I see the X-ray technician‚Äôs face; the look in his eyes still haunts me. Any look other than a blank stare would be extremely concerning, but his face was a different story. I saw his eyes roam the obscured X-ray chart with unmistakable horror and unprecedented confusion. I just stared blankly and reflected on my life. Did I have any regrets? Not particularly. But did I have any remorse that my existence was marching toward a much sooner than expected end? No. No, I didn‚Äôt.

The X-ray tech finally pulls himself together and runs out of the room, most likely in search of the doctor. I held my wife‚Äôs hand tightly and lied to her. I told her everything would be okay, that I would be okay. I think it was okay to lie in that situation; the lie was to protect her, not me. I told her I was sorry for being the man I was, for not loving her how I should. Maybe that was a mistake, because as soon as the words left my mouth, she became a fully incoherent mess of sobs.

The X-ray tech brings the doctor and a few nurses back to the room. They huddled around the chart, each of them going pale. The doctor‚Äôs reaction was the one I was looking for; he was clearly a very composed man. You have to be in a field like this. He sees horrors and tragedies daily that are beyond my comprehension. That‚Äôs why his slack-jawed expression felt like a dagger in my heart, finally finishing off my suspicions. He just stared at it. They all mumbled amongst themselves, loud enough that I could comprehend they were panicked, but not loud enough that I could hear them clearly. I hugged my wife and lied to her again.

The doctor approached us solemnly. I just asked what came to my mind: ‚ÄúIs it cancer? Clogged valves? Blood clots? Is any of it treatable?‚Äù

He waits until the words have fully left my mouth before he replies stoically, ‚ÄúMr. Alberstran, there‚Äôs not only no easy way to put this, there is no way at all to put this. It‚Äôs your heart‚Ä¶‚Äù

I awaited my death sentence.

The doctor patiently said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on the left side of your body, Mr. Alberstran.‚Äù

While I gave him a look of utter confusion, my inconsolable wife excused herself immediately.

At this point, I‚Äôm full of relief and rage. ‚ÄúIs this a joke?‚Äù I spat out with venom.

The doctor gives a look of understanding, like I‚Äôm in denial and he‚Äôs having to get the severity of the matter across. Except I don‚Äôt see an ounce of severity in the situation. I humor him and allow him to continue without launching into a tirade. I‚Äôm still anxiously awaiting him to drop a bomb.

He says, ‚ÄúI know this is‚Ä¶ how do I say this‚Ä¶ irregular, Mr. Alberstran, but it isn‚Äôt just your heart. It‚Äôs everything: stomach, pancreas, spleen, right lobe of the liver, descending colon‚Äîit‚Äôs all on the left side of your body, and vice versa. I saw your medical chart; you have no health conditions that I could find that this might have affected, so the heart attack could be unrelated.‚Äù

At this point, now that he‚Äôs fully gotten the point across, I‚Äôm really relieved and really pissed. ‚ÄúYou just scared my wife half to death to tell me my heart‚Äôs on the left side of my body? Who the hell do you think you are? What bomb are you going to drop next? That I have two eyes and a nose? All while you gossip with your nurses like I have a clogged artery in front of my wife!‚Äù I‚Äôm fully worked up now; given my heart attack three days prior, this was probably an unwise reaction.

The doctor is shocked by my reaction, somehow even more dumbfounded than when he saw my chart. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre understanding the severity of this. I‚Äôm going to print off a copy of this chart for you to take home. You seem to be fine, and on paper, this condition shouldn‚Äôt affect you directly. I would just highly recommend you take this to a cardiothoracic surgeon, maybe even a human anatomist.‚Äù

I‚Äôm too confused by the situation to provide a retort; he‚Äôs already getting up and walking toward the door anyway, so I let him leave without asking any more questions. I didn‚Äôt go to college, but I took a biology class in high school. The heart is on the left side, the pancreas and spleen on the left side. Why is that so insane?

My wife and I drove home in silence. I couldn‚Äôt get a read on how she was feeling, but I knew that she was too confused and scared to be questioned.

‚ÄúThe doctor said I should be fine, ya know? Aside from the kook bullshit about my organs being on the side they‚Äôre supposed to be, he seemed to think everything else is under control. I might have to slow down on the bacon though, honey.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt speak. She almost did, but she had this face of annoyance at me. The fact that I‚Äôm so calm about all this is more disturbing than whatever she‚Äôs disturbed about. We creep into our driveway, and she doesn‚Äôt waste any time getting out of the car.

I follow her into the house. ‚ÄúWill you just talk to me? Why are you being like this? I‚Äôm healthy!‚Äù

‚ÄúHealthy?‚Äù she incredulously spat out. ‚ÄúYour heart is on your left side, Martin!‚Äù

I‚Äôm confused and annoyed. ‚ÄúDammit, honey, not you too? What the hell do you mean my heart‚Äôs on the left side? That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs always been, yours too!‚Äù

I tried to hide it, but I was scared. Either I had gone insane, or the doctors, the nurses, the X-ray technicians, and my own wife were all crazy. I don‚Äôt know which was worse.

While I‚Äôm zoned out thinking about this, she pulled out the chart the doctor printed off. The doctor also printed a standard sample X-ray. She held them both up right in my face. ‚ÄúMartin! Something is wrong here, and something is wrong with you for not acknowledging it.‚Äù

I just stared at the two charts. Each one is a mirror image of the other.

It‚Äôs been a few days since then. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real. All I know is that I am not crazy. I remember laying my head down on my wife‚Äôs chest, hearing her heartbeat, feeling her heartbeat. It was on the left side of her chest. That‚Äôs just how it‚Äôs always been. It can‚Äôt be any other way. I refuse to let it be any other way. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my wife since she showed me the charts. I‚Äôve tried searching for anyone who remembers the heart being on the left side, anyone sane like me, but there‚Äôs not a single result. So I came here. I just need someone to say I‚Äôm not crazy. Just one.",2,1755338526.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1mrqs05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neurodivergent/comments/1mrqs05/i_tried_to_figure_out_how_neurotypical_brains/,I tried to figure out how neurotypical brains work. What do you think?,"Since there are many texts about how people with neurodivergent disorders are perceived (based on their symptoms), I now do it the other way around and describe neurotypical people from the point of view of a neurodivergent person.

Neurotypical people just think differently:

When a new person joins the neurotypical group, they are basically rejected and not liked, instead of getting to know them first to find out what they are like and whether they fit in, whether they can be trusted or not. The new person must adjust for the group to accept them. If this person is different in any way, they will be directly rejected and there is no chance the group will accept them.

Neurotypical people try to deal with their own dissatisfaction (as children, teenagers and sometimes in adulthood) by choosing a person who they think is weaker and harassing them to their heart's content. They choose things that are considered ugly in society, for example, and write this quality to this ""weaker"" person, who will most likely believe the group, so that he (if he does not fight back) continues to be bullied. Neurotypicals use this method to test limits and to regain their frustration through the feeling of power.

Neurotypical people do not use direct speech. There are some sentences that cannot be understood verbatim. It is important that they have a feeling (not yet a description for it) that they constantly need social confirmation, i.e. ""I am wanted"". This is expressed, for example, if they receive a cancellation for a meeting, they demand an apology (no matter whether the person is obviously lying or not, they usually know that themselves, but they don't care), so that they confirm: ""Ok, you don't want to meet today, but it's understandable why, so it's not about me and you want to continue to have something to do with me."" Just like in the sentence: ""Would you like to go for a coffee sometime?"", there is no invitation, but the sentence: ""I don't want to have anything to do with you, but I still want to give you the feeling that I do.""

They also demand it from others. For example, if they say: ""We're going to eat now in the restaurant."" (and say that to a person who is not yet in this group ""we""), they expect the adressed person to approach them and ask if they can come along. This gives them the feeling: ""I am so great that other people also ask if they can do something with me/us.""

Neurotypical people know by nature which sentences actually have a double interpretation that cannot be taken literally.

Neurotypical people like to talk about themselves. This makes them feel like they are wanted. They don't like interruptions. It should be all about them at that moment.

(Neurodivergent people often share similar experiences from their lives to express understanding. This also works with other neurodivergent people, as they find it acceptable. Neurotypical, however, not.)

Neurotypical people use superficial phrases such as: ""How are you?"", of which they receive the answer ""Good and you?"" Already expected. Just like talking about the weather, it's their way of being able to communicate with everyone, because they are topics that everyone can talk about. They do not expect to find actual similarities or the same interests in general.

Neurotypical people assume that your actions show your will, because they themselves always act according to their will. If they want to do something, they can, because they don't have to pay attention to other stimuli, spontaneous thoughts that interrupt or the like, because they don't have them.

(That's why it's important to recognize ADHD and autism as disabilities.)

They therefore do not understand that there may be other backgrounds for the actions of some people, in other words, that someone acts from other logical conclusions than their own will is unthinkable for them.

In addition, they do not come to the concept of possible chronic or mental illness on their own if a person behaves ""strangerly"" according to their standard. They also don't feel the need to know the reasons, on the one hand because they think they already know the solution (based on the ""he/she wants it"" principle) and secondly, because they don't really care.
They do not understand that other people may think differently, have had other reasons and experiences, etc.

So, that means a neurotypical (and mentally healthy) person can wake up in the morning, fully awake, and ready to start their day. They have complete control over their brain. They can decide whether or not to think a thought through. They never experience sudden pop-up thoughts. If they want to do something, they have complete control and freedom of choice over whether to pursue it or decide to do something else first. They focus so intensely on the essentials that they never think of few connections between different things (which are not there at the moment), and even in the present tense, they rarely notice details (sounds, temperature, light intensity, the actions of everyone, etc.) unless they focus on them. They can turn their concentration on and off at will. To-do lists and routines appear automatically in their minds, allowing them to simply follow them. They can go about their daily lives without experiencing any major emotions. They go to school/work/university in the morning, do what's required there, and go home again without much stress. Even after a long day at work, they still have enough energy to meet up with friends, go shopping, etc.
Even stressful moments and emotions in general feel far less intense, so even if they're sad, they can still get up and have a good day. They can actively choose to act against any emotion. While the emotions aren't gone, they can be regulated through action if the body doesn't do it itself.

Edit- I‚Äôm adding this on because it shows who I‚Äôm dealing with. The other day I mentioned maybe my mom could pour her orange juice into a glass or a different drinking apparatus with a lid so she can grab it from the fridge herself, and we could put her danish on a plate with a cake dish lid on top so I could have a break in the morning sometimes. My grandmother said no. She said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt eat that way‚Äù. So she won‚Äôt have a glass of juice that was pre poured ; maybe in a different glass that has a lid but I have to change and destroy my whole life‚Ä¶ this example makes me really mad because it is just so her‚Ä¶ 


This is killing me. Taking care of a toddler and someone in their 90s‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too much for a person. I never wanted to have just one baby since being an only child was and is so awful for me, but I decided to stop at one because I couldn‚Äôt imagine having the physical and mental bandwidth to care for anything else other than my toddler.. I don‚Äôt even have a pet for the first time in my life because I can‚Äôt handle anything else. And now I have to take care of my grandmother. She went home on Tuesday from a rehab. While at the rehab I visited everyday. When I wouldn‚Äôt, she would call me saying I haven‚Äôt been there in days. I took 3 days off that entire month she was there. Now she‚Äôs home and I have to go there every morning . She‚Äôs constantly complaining and crying. She‚Äôs such a nervous wreck it‚Äôs out of control. She‚Äôs on the lowest possible dose of Xanax and her doctor won‚Äôt up her because her doctor is a family  medicine doctor, not a psych doctor. My family is small. It‚Äôs just my mom and I caring for her. My uncle jumped ship. He didn‚Äôt even call her once during the awful rehab and hospital experience. Being in the rehab and not using her brain how she used to has changed her. She is so much less independent than she was. Not only because of the healing broken hip. But mentally. I feel like she can get herself the breakfast she eats but she waits hours for me to get there and put it out for her. She‚Äôs doing well getting around with her walker . After working me like a dog yesterday, my only day there without my 3 year old, I was trying to leave and she complained there‚Äôs never any time to visit with me‚Ä¶. She also doesn‚Äôt like that I have to bring my daughter all the time. I don‚Äôt like having them both talk to me at the same time and asking for things either. My grandmother can‚Äôt hear my daughter so she talks at the same time. And my daughter is 3‚Ä¶ she tries to wait for my grandmother to finish talking but my grandmother will literally take 5 minutes to say something a normal person would say in one sentence. My daughter gets tired of waiting. It‚Äôs truly excessive. My mom was supposed to take care of her house while she was gone but my mom is awful at doing things right and the house is a wreck. Cat hair everywhere. My daughter has allergic reactions to cats and her skin gets red and itchy. It‚Äôs always hot at her house so I‚Äôm sweating constantly and cat hair is sticking to my face‚Ä¶ cat litter tracked on the floor under my feet . It makes me sick. I can‚Äôt stand that shit. I have sensory issues and it makes me sick. My grandmother is set on things being how she wants them because she has undiagnosed ocd that is so severe it affected her recovery. She‚Äôs constantly panicking over stupid stuff. It‚Äôs driving me crazy.. she started panicking because I didn‚Äôt bring a fucking placemat out for her breakfast.. because I poured the creamer and coffee together instead of coffee first then creamer.. like what ??? Who cares‚Ä¶ her ocd and anxiety is unbearable for me, and the worst part is when I tell her a situation isn‚Äôt bad, that it‚Äôs her mental illness, she claims she‚Äôs normal and everyone else is wrong . She‚Äôs unbearable and she‚Äôs starting to come off as slightly senile. I heard her crying to the nurse that comes by to change a bandage 3 times a week, telling her how awful the rehab was and she was going on and on for 5 mins about the food being all ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù. It was not all Mexican food. And that they don‚Äôt know how American food works. Because the paired a chicken sandwhich with mashed potatoes.. she‚Äôs mentioned this chicken sandwhich being paired with mashed potatoes to everyone she‚Äôs talked to.. hoe doesn‚Äôt she hear how crazy she sounds?? She never thinks maybe this person thinks they go together just fine? The other day I told her I was gonna leave after being there all morning into the afternoon. I told her I needed to grocery shop because I had to scrounge to find something to feed my kid for dinner the previous night and I had nothing else to feed her.. she really said ‚Äúit‚Äôs early‚Äù and was asking me to stay longer‚Ä¶ I ended up leaving and getting home from the grocery store at 4pm. I sat down and rested my extremely bad back for a half hour while my daughter played alone before I had to get up and shower the cat shit off is then make dinner‚Ä¶ did she want me to rush through the grocery? Not shower so I would itch all night? Not feed myself and my kid? Because I would have to give one up if I had stayed like she wanted.. last night my mom called me cause my grandma was having a freak out when she was told my mom was taking her to a doctors apt coming up. She was saying she didn‚Äôt know how she got in the house and she can‚Äôt do the one step to outside‚Ä¶ when we got her home my husband was with me so she was on her best behavior and it went SO smoothly. It couldn‚Äôt have gone any better. She got in the house easily. Because she decided ahead that she wasn‚Äôt gonna have a plan cause she had to just see what happens. She couldn‚Äôt plan because she didn‚Äôt know how she would do getting in a car, going up a step. And she did so well. She‚Äôs planning this doctors apt to the point it‚Äôs causing such bad anxiety she can‚Äôt function. She gets so nervous over NOTHING that she can‚Äôt talk or function and acts like an idiot and I just can‚Äôt take it‚Ä¶ her ocd is ruining everyone‚Äôs lives. She couldn‚Äôt eat properly at the rehab because her ocd is so extreme and everything wasn‚Äôt perfect. At first she wouldn‚Äôt drink water cause she was so concerned with having to pee and her bed getting messed up.. I would make the bed for her how she wanted it and she would stay in it from the afternoon til the next morning to avoid a nurse not making it right‚Ä¶ and she really thinks she doesn‚Äôt have a problem. The nurses are the problem. Because they don‚Äôt make the beds right. She tells us what to do and she shrieks if she thinks she didn‚Äôt do a part right before even giving us a chance to finish. She always says how my mom does everything wrong and it‚Äôs true; she messes things up A LOT but I think a big reason is my mom being impatient while my grandmother is taking 10 minutes to explain every detail of how she wants something done when it could be said in 3 words. My mom can‚Äôt pay attention to it . I‚Äôm always having to listen to these monologues too. My 3 year old will patiently be waiting for my grandmother is finish talking but she never stops. It goes on and on . I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. This isn‚Äôt even just from she. She always was long winded like this. But it‚Äôs beyond normal long winded. And now after being independent she acts like she can‚Äôt even make phone calls for herself. Just add it on to grand daughters work load (me), even though she‚Äôs doing nothing all day but crying and bitching . My mom and I have both lost weight cause we are so busy and stressed we can‚Äôt even eat. I don‚Äôt want my daughter spending her childhood around this ‚Ä¶.. I need to figure out another way.

1mrqqrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanExpatsUK/comments/1mrqqrz/when_visiting_the_embassy_in_london/,When Visiting the Embassy in London....,"I visited the US Embassy two days ago, thought some of this might help someone. 

For ref: I took my twins aged 16 for first adult passports. They had child passports that expired while we have been here, first adult passports require an appointment. Both have autism (one severe) and one has a walking issue. I had a lot of things i wanted to know before traveling and found it hard to get the answers, so hopefully this helps someone searching in the future. 

I drove - we live in the Midlands and one of my children will not go anywhere noisy or on a train etc, as well as we cant do much walking. Appointments were only available super early, so we had an 8am and 8.30am slot when we booked. We had to leave the house at 4.15am, intending to get to parking by 7.15am. Traffic was rough from outskirts of London (M40) and we did not get to parking till 7.45 and i was super stressed.  Thanks to advice on this sub we used Just Park to prebook parking at Waitrose, Nine Elms. Best decision ever, we ditched car and as you walk out of the car park, you turn right, 1 minute walk and entrance to Embassy is on the left. Outside is a desk with officers, to the right is a long line for visas etc and to the left is US Citizen line - there was no one in it, we were seen immediately, I as the adult was asked for ID only, and we went into the first building which is security like at the airport. Do not take big bags or laptops. I had tiny bag, phone and documents only so it was quick. We then had to exit that building and go to the main entrance, this was another one minute walk.

In main entrance, again you get to bypass the line if you are here for US Citizen services. They gave me a number with both appointments on, so they were merged into one appointment (this had been  worry for me as if they had got called at the same time i had no clue what i would do). We took the elevator to the 2nd floor and then you wait for your number to be called to a window at the left side of the room. It was super clean, lots of seats, coffee in the middle of the room and big clean restrooms. Great views too. Also had 2 photo booths so you don't need to get photos ahead of time. You can also pay there at another window. At the first call of your number the initial officer looked at all the info, checked it was all ok , then told us to wait to be called again for interview. These interviews took place at the other end of the room. 

Interview was literally standing at another window, she asked if the kids could sign the application in front of her (they did) then we all had to raise out right hand and affirm everything was true, then that was it - we were told the new passports will arrive in 3 weeks.

Issues - we did wait over an hour between first and second window appointments, and i had to ask how much longer as my child with more severe autism was getting agitated and saying inappropriate things loudly (dont ask üôà) so the officer said he would see if he could bump us up. We were seen in the next 2 minutes. And the interviewer gave her stickers üíô. We booked parking for 3 hours and were there 2 1/2. Hope that helps someone out.

I know it's not the best score but i'm happy with it for now; it seems alright to proceed with for decent, non-US MBA programs!

I started with the GMAT Focus edition back in 2024, absolutely screwed up there along with messing with my physical & mental health (think perceptible levels of testing anxiety + weak math foundations + what now feels like a poorly thought-out decision to quit my job to focus on the prep). The stress around being unemployed messed with my head a lot, so now I know that's not something that works for me.

Then I decided to find a job again and switch to GRE - and i'm glad that i did! Started with gregmat in Jan 2025, studied till well yesterday and finally took the exam.

Materials I used:   
\- Gregmat I'm Overwhelmed Plan for Quant  
\- Gregmat 1 month plan for Verbal  
\- Gregmat 1020 words + my own excel of difficult words (so around 1200-1300 in total)  
\- Manhattan 5lb for my weak quant areas  
\- GRE Big Book for RC, TC and CR practice  
\- OG Guides (not the latest version, the one before that)

Study Plan & Approach:  
\- Squeezed in 1.5-2 hours before work on weekdays + 4-5 hours (minimum) on weekends  
\- Tried to tackle one thing at a time; either 1 topic in Quant or 1 question type in Verbal  
\- Math strategy for TC and SE (don't even look beyond these)  
\- Squeezed in Vocab during work commute + including words in everyday texts & convos  
\- Last 1.5 months; took a full-length mock every Sunday (including the AWA section) to build the 2-hour muscle for when we sit for the real exam  
\- Last 2 months; started using the onscreen calculator and tried to use it sparingly  
\- Error log for Quant + analysis with detailed explanations of where exactly I'm going wrong and WHY

Mindset Shift:  
\- Negative self talk was my biggest enemy and no amount of hard work would offset the detriment from that. Switched the narrative and started doing active, positive self talk (could be out loud or even forcing myself to think in the other direction)  
\- Talking to people in my inner circle about my anxieties and working through (threads on this subreddit also helped massively). Also taking breaks once in a while and not totally cutting off my social time  
\- To combat my testing anxiety, I forced myself to take full length mocks and timed sectional tests on Gregmat website, so I'm not caught off-guard on exam day  
\- Crazy discipline when it came to balancing prep along with office. I slept by 9.30 pm and woke up by 4.30 am.   
\- Kept a check on my coffee and sleep as I get frequent migraines and stress-induced headaches as well which would set me back a few days/weeks when I couldn't manage to look at the screen. 

Results:  
\- I took 5-6 mocks, both PP1 and PP2 + PPP3 + Magoosh free mock + Manhattan free mock + OG Guide tests as well. Averaged around 319-326 across all of them, so the 324 is right where it should be. I'm okay applying with this now and don't feel the need to take another attempt and I'm hoping 324 will get me somewhere decent. I also think I lucked out a little because I was worried about quant (given the recent chatter around difficulty levels in quant) but it turned out alright. Verbal was quite tough, especially TC, but math strategy worked. Point is, thoughtful strategy > gut feeling.

## Key features Analysis

The quality and aesthetic appeal of a driftwood table depend heavily on its features. Factors like the type of wood, the craftsmanship, the finish, and the overall design contribute to its uniqueness and durability.

**Wood Type and Source:** The type of wood used in a driftwood table substantially impacts its appearance and structural integrity. Common wood types include pine, cedar, and hardwoods like oak. Knowing the origin of the driftwood is also significant; responsibly sourced driftwood ensures that the table is not only gorgeous but also environmentally conscious. Tables crafted from sustainably harvested driftwood contribute to the preservation of natural resources.

**tabletop Construction:** The tabletop of a driftwood table can be constructed in various ways. Some tables feature a single, large piece of driftwood, showcasing its natural shape and texture. Others are made from multiple pieces carefully assembled to create a smooth, functional surface. The craftsmanship involved in joining these pieces is crucial for stability and aesthetic appeal. Resin inlays or glass tops are sometimes incorporated to create a more polished look while still highlighting the driftwood's natural beauty.

**Base Design and Material:** The base of a driftwood table plays a vital role in its overall stability and style.Common base materials include metal, wood, and even more driftwood. Metal bases often provide a sleek, modern contrast to the rustic tabletop, while wooden bases complement the natural aesthetic. The design of the base should also be considered,as it can range from simple,minimalist structures to more elaborate,artistic creations.A sturdy and well-designed base is essential for ensuring that the table can withstand daily use.

**finish and Treatment:** the finish applied to a driftwood table not only enhances its appearance but also protects it from moisture, wear, and tear. Common finishes include clear coats,stains,and sealants. A clear coat preserves the natural color and texture of the driftwood, while a stain can add depth and richness. The treatment process is essential for preventing the wood from cracking or warping over time. Properly treated driftwood tables are more resistant to environmental factors and will maintain their beauty for years to come.

**Size and Dimensions:** Driftwood tables come in a wide range of sizes and dimensions, making it important to choose one that fits your space and needs. Consider the dimensions of your room and the intended use of the table when making your selection.Smaller tables are ideal for accent pieces or side tables, while larger tables are better suited for dining or conference areas. The height of the table should also be taken into account to ensure it is cozy and functional.

**Unique Artistic Elements:** One of the defining features of driftwood tables is their inherent uniqueness. Each piece of driftwood has its own distinct shape, texture, and character, making every table a one-of-a-kind work of art. Some tables incorporate additional artistic elements, such as carvings, inlays, or metal accents, to further enhance their visual appeal. These personal touches add to the table's value and make it a focal point in any room.

## Core Benefits

The benefits of owning a driftwood table extend beyond its aesthetic appeal. From its natural beauty and durability to its eco-kind nature, a driftwood table can enhance your living space in numerous ways.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A driftwood table brings a touch of nature indoors, adding a unique and organic element to your home decor. Its rustic charm and natural textures create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Whether your style is coastal, bohemian, or modern, a driftwood table can seamlessly blend into your existing aesthetic and enhance its overall appeal.

**Environmental Sustainability:** Choosing a driftwood table supports sustainable practices by repurposing reclaimed wood.

# COLD OPEN



**SCENE 1 INT. PRINCESS CAROLYN'S OFFICE - DAY (2025)** The office of VIM is a polished, professional space with a playful, domestic charm. Princess Carolyn is a blur of coordinated activity, dictating an email while reviewing contracts. Judah sits calmly across from her, a picture of perfect composure in his business casual outfit. He sips from a glass of water.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: ...and a bold, new voice. So get me that voice, Jessica! The kind of voice that says, 'I am a human who has had a deeply traumatic childhood, and I've found my solace in artisanal hummus!' (She hangs up, smiling at Judah.) See? Easy.

JUDAH: Indeed. My calculations indicate a 98% probability of success. It is a predictable and logical outcome.

Suddenly, Judah winces, a quick, sharp intake of breath. He sets his glass down with an uncharacteristically shaky hand and presses his other hand against his lower back.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What was that? A hiccup? A small, existential gasp?

JUDAH: (Through a strained but calm voice) No. My apologies. I believe a bodily function is occurring that I did not foresee. I have a kidney stone. The hospital would like me to come in immediately.

Princess Carolyn's eyes widen. Her organized world begins to unravel.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: A kidney stone? Now? But I have a call with Netflix and I have to pick up Ruthie! I can't be in two places at once! I'll call Todd...

(Princess Carolyn places a call on speakerphone. We hear a muffled Todd.)

TODD (O.S.): Hey, Princess Carolyn! Ooh, sorry, Maude and I are super busy right now. We're, uh, we're in a meeting with a macaroni investor. It's a real high-stakes situation.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: An investor in a macaroni what?! Never mind, I don't have time for this!

(She hangs up. She looks at Judah, and a look of resigned determination washes over her face.)

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (To herself) Okay. We'll call BoJack.

(Judah's calm, logical face remains unchanged. Princess Carolyn dials BoJack‚Äôs number with a sigh of relief, not dread.)

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Into phone) Hey. It‚Äôs me. I know you‚Äôre on the straight and narrow now, and I trust you with Ruthie. I know it‚Äôs a big ask, but I need you to go to my place. Judah has a kidney stone, and I'll be at the hospital for a few hours.

(The camera pans to a frantic Princess Carolyn, pulling up BoJack's contact on her phone, as the screen fades to black.)



# Intro Animation



**SCENE 2 INT. BOJACK'S APARTMENT - DAY**

(The credits roll in a traditional animated sequence. The sequence begins with a front-facing, medium close-up shot of **BoJack**, as he wakes up in his bed in his new apartment. The camera stays in this position, as he slowly gets up and begins to stroll through his apartment.)

(He moves towards the kitchen and back out, still in the same front-facing shot, a cup of coffee now in his hand. He takes a sip and looks down, lifting a handful of mail.)

(The camera then shifts to a brief over-the-shoulder POV shot, as his hands flip through the stack of letters, revealing in succession: a picture of **Princess Carolyn**, **Judah**, and **Ruthie** smiling brightly; a snapshot of **Diane** and her husband **Guy**; a glossy poster for ""**TV DAD: SEASON 7**""; a new copy of Diane's self-help book; and finally, a few colorful, scribbled children's drawings. The drawings show a sloppy superhero, a scribbled horse figure on a TV, and a stick figure with a yellow beanie hat. He flips the drawing over to read the childish handwriting on the back: ""**FOR BOJACK, FROM TODD.**"")

(The shot immediately shifts back to the front-facing shot. BoJack looks up at the camera, a single, exasperated eye-roll.)

(Still in the front-facing shot, BoJack is seen in a room with an AA meeting in progress, with people drinking coffee in the background. The scene shifts to BoJack listening to a conversation with **Dr. Indira** in her therapy office. BoJack's eyes are to the side, and he is listening and nodding to her advice. The scene shifts back to BoJack in his apartment, moving backwards.)

(A quick cut shows BoJack's foot stepping on a small, bright red toy on the floor, causing him to slip.)

(The camera immediately returns to a front-facing shot of BoJack, as he falls backward into his bed with a ""poof!"" He looks directly up at the camera with a shocked expression. He then shields his eyes from a bright ceiling light.)

(The camera pans up from BoJack to a television screen in his room, which is showing a news report. The reporter on screen is wide-eyed and shocked, pointing up at a deflated blimp in the sky, which is falling slowly onto the Hollywood Hills.)

(The camera then pans out from the television screen, through the apartment window, and soars up at the sky and the Hollywood sign in the background. The title card, **BOJACK HORSEMAN** with ""**Season 7**"" underneath, pops up. The music ends, and the scene fades to black.)



# ACT 1: The Last Resort



**SCENE 3 INT. BOJACK'S APARTMENT - DAY** The camera shows BoJack's small, unadorned apartment. He is sitting on his couch, wearing his black sweater underneath an as-unzipped-as-it-can-be grey hoodie, light blue jeans, and faded red Converse sneakers. He looks bored, flipping through channels on a small TV. He answers his phone.

BOJACK: (Into phone) Hey. It‚Äôs BoJack. Look, I‚Äôm not signing up for another subscription box, so unless this is a pizza place that delivers happiness, you‚Äôve got the wrong horse.

PRINCESS CAROLYN (O.S.): Hey BoJack. I need a huge favor. I know you're doing much better now, and you're the only one I trust. I need you to babysit Ruthie. Judah has to go to the hospital.

BoJack sighs. He has nothing else to do.

BOJACK: Fine. But if she draws on anything that isn't paper, I'm billing you for the therapy.

(He arrives at Princess Carolyn‚Äôs house a few hours later. It‚Äôs a beautiful, modern home. He walks inside to find a seven-year-old **Ruthie** wearing a trendy jacket with a cartoon logo, tennis shoes, and a backpack shaped like a book. Her porcupine needles occasionally poke through her clothes. She is sitting on the floor, surrounded by a mountain of art supplies.)

RUTHIE: You must be BoJack.

BOJACK: (Slightly offended, but in a polite, sarcastic tone) Obviously. We've met before. You don't remember me? Yeesh, what has TikTok done to you kids. Got the memory of a Goldfish.

RUTHIE: I don't use TikTok. That's for old people.

BOJACK: Wow! (Clears throat) Right. Okay then. Now, where is everything? Your mom said to give you dinner and put you to bed at a reasonable hour. What do you eat, like... pellets or something? She said she'll be gone for a few hours, and then she'll be home.

(He walks into the kitchen and notices a stack of children's drawings on the fridge. One of them is a portrait of a horse. BoJack looks closer, and sees that the horse has the same tired and sad eyes as his own, with a small smile underneath. He smiles to himself. He's found his place, for now.)

**SCENE 4 INT. PRINCESS CAROLYN'S CAR - DAY** Princess Carolyn is driving erratically through Los Angeles traffic, honking her horn and muttering to herself. Judah is in the passenger seat, holding his laptop as if nothing is wrong, but a light sheen of sweat has broken out on his brow.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (To herself) Okay, okay, okay, okay. We can still make it. Just need to get to the hospital before this traffic decides to form a sentient blob and try to apply for an assistant manager position at VIM.

(A sharp, sudden wave of pain hits Judah. He lets out a small, quiet, painful gasp, but quickly returns to his normal demeanor.)

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Without looking at him) You okay, honey? Don't worry, my heart is only beating at 1,000 beats per minute, which is still well within the acceptable range for a feline of my size!

JUDAH: The pain has increased by approximately 18%. Based on my pre-departure calculations, this is consistent with the standard progression of a kidney stone. However, I have concluded that the current market conditions present an optimal window for us to acquire the independent animation studio, ""Toadstool & Sons,"" a name that I find to be an unfortunate double entendre.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Judah, you are literally passing a rock through your body. We are not talking about ""Toadstool & Sons"" right now.

JUDAH: My analysis indicates that the window will close within 72 hours. We cannot afford to wait. It is an opportunity to expand our roster of talent and, more importantly, a potential hedge against the increasingly volatile market for live-action reboots.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (She pulls to a screeching halt at a red light) The only thing that is a hedge right now is me, getting ready to make a run for it across this six-lane intersection! I'm a good mom, a good manager, and a good fiance! I'm doing all of it at once!

(The light turns green. Judah looks at Princess Carolyn, his expression a mixture of calm and admiration.)

JUDAH: You are. The data is clear on that.

(Princess Carolyn sighs, a moment of rare relief. She stomps on the gas, and the car lurches forward.)



# ACT 2: The Art of the Deal



**SCENE 5 INT. PRINCESS CAROLYN'S HOUSE - LATER**

(The day drags on. **BoJack** is in the living room, trying to figure out how to be an inattentive but responsible babysitter. He pulls out a box of old board games and brings it to Ruthie.)

BOJACK: Okay, kid. Let's play a game. It's called ""What Would You Do If You Were Me?"" It's a fun game where I ask you a series of increasingly difficult questions about my life, and you provide me with sage, eight-year-old advice! It‚Äôs a classic! We'll have a blast!

(Ruthie looks at him, unimpressed. She silently gets up, and begins to stack the cushions from the couch in the middle of the room.)

BOJACK: What are you doing?

RUTHIE: Building a fort. It's for my friend.

BOJACK: (Sighs) You don't have a friend here.

RUTHIE: I know. But I will.

(BoJack, out of ideas, gives up. He goes into the kitchen to find a snack. He tries to get a bag of chips from a pantry. He sits on a stool and watches Ruthie methodically build a sprawling, complex pillow fort, a masterpiece of engineering. He then gets an idea.)

BOJACK: Hey, I have an idea! Why don't we watch a movie. Have you seen Secretariat? I'm in it! It's super meta! You'll love it!

(Ruthie doesn't answer. She is now focused on her art. BoJack pulls out a phone, and goes to Netflix. He notices his name is missing from the accounts page. He shrugs and goes to a different streaming site, and searches for another movie, he comes across the show 'Around' Formerly 'Horsin Around' He sighs and turns off the TV. He's not in the mood for it, and neither is Ruthie.)

**SCENE 6 INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM / INTAKE AREA - CONTINUOUS** The hospital waiting room is a bland, beige collection of sad-looking chairs. **PRINCESS CAROLYN** paces back and forth, vibrating with a tense energy. **JUDAH** sits calmly in a chair as a disinterested **ANTEATER NURSE** goes through the intake process.

NURSE: Name?

JUDAH: Judah Mannowdog.

NURSE: Chief complaint?

JUDAH: (He glances at Princess Carolyn, then back at the nurse) It has been determined that a solid concretion of crystallized mineral deposits is currently obstructing a portion of my urinary tract. My subjective perception is that it is causing a significant departure from my standard operating parameters.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Slamming her fist on the counter) He has a kidney stone! Just a regular, garden-variety kidney stone! He's not a robot, he's a person! A person who is in immense pain, and we'd like you to fix him, please! Do you have a brochure? Or a five-year plan for kidney stone removal? Because I could help you with that!

NURSE: Please fill out this form. And we'll need Mr. Mannowdog to change into a gown.

Judah's brow furrows slightly. He looks down at his perfectly pressed business casual outfit, then back at the paper-thin gown.

JUDAH: Is there a brand standard? My calculations indicate the polyester blend has a 97% chance of causing an allergic reaction. I have brought a backup, hypoallergenic garment for this very contingency.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Grabbing his hand) Judah! Just put on the gown! It's fine! Just... put it on!

A moment later, Judah is being wheeled down a hallway by an orderly, wearing the paper-thin gown over his clothes. His face is a mask of stoic calm, but his grip on his laptop is white-knuckled.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (To the nurse) Look, if you need a consultant for improving the efficiency of your intake process, I have some ideas! My hourly rate is...

The Nurse sighs and shakes her head, already moving on to the next patient. Princess Carolyn stands alone in the waiting room, finally alone with her thoughts.

**SCENE 7 INT. PRINCESS CAROLYN'S HOUSE - LATER** The hours have melted away. **BoJack** is lying awkwardly on the plush rug in the living room, propped up on one elbow. He is visibly bored, flicking a crumpled napkin with his finger. Across the room, **Ruthie** is a picture of serene focus, kneeling over a small canvas with a concentration he can't comprehend. She is surrounded by a sea of markers, paints, and brushes.

BOJACK: I'm starting to get the feeling I'm not contributing much here. They could have just set you in front of a paint canvas, and thats that. You know, it's funny... I used to be a little like you. Quiet, you know? Just... inside my own head. My mom would tell me to go outside and make friends. She was a real... a real piece of work. The point is, you gotta get out there. Be a kid. Let it all out.

Ruthie doesn't respond. Her small hand moves with purpose.

BOJACK: (Sighs) What do you even do, anyway? I mean, besides, you know, being an adorable, tiny porcupine.

RUTHIE: (Without looking up) Draw.

BOJACK: Yeah, I noticed. Well, thats good. Then do that! Don't let anyone try to stop you. Do it everywhere you can! Until it makes you happy! Go big or go home, you know?

BoJack is pleased with his seemingly profound-sounding advice. He smiles to himself, feeling like a real mentor. He claps his hands together, pleased with his work.

BOJACK: Okay! You work on that masterpiece, and I'm going to find us some snacks to celebrate this little... breakthrough.

BoJack gets up and struts into the kitchen. The refrigerator door opens, and he's a blur of motion, searching for the perfect snack. A beat of quiet as only the sounds of his rummaging fill the air. Then, he returns to the living room with a bowl of chips, some dip, and a triumphant smile.

BOJACK: You know, I'm pretty good at this. I think I might babysit more oft...

His smile freezes. His eyes widen. The wall. The entire hallway wall is no longer a pristine, white expanse. It is a massive, sprawling, intricate mural of every color imaginable. It depicts a chaotic, beautiful family portrait: Princess Carolyn and Judah, Ruthie herself, a smaller-scale Todd and Maude, all in their chaotic little worlds. And, in a corner, an intricately detailed drawing of a sad-looking horse, with a shadowy figure in a dark hoodie standing almost unnoticed in the background.

BOJACK: (A high-pitched whisper of horror) No. No, no, no...

He runs to the wall, frantically trying to wipe a section with his thumb. The lines don't budge. He runs to the kitchen sink, grabs a wet sponge, and scrubs. Nothing. The colors remain, permanent and vibrant. He looks down at the floor, and sees the culprit. A dozen or so colored Sharpie markers, all with their caps removed. BoJack stares at them, his eyes wide with a quiet, irreversible dread.

BOJACK: PC's gonna kill me.

**SCENE 8 INT. HOSPITAL RECOVERY ROOM / LOBBY - EVENING** The fluorescent lights of the hospital recovery room hum with a tired, antiseptic drone. **JUDAH** is sitting up on a hospital bed, slightly groggy from the anesthesia. He's trying to put his socks on, but he's holding them upside down. **PRINCESS CAROLYN** stands over him, looking utterly exhausted, her usually manic energy replaced with a bone-deep weariness. She's holding his folded-up business casual outfit.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, honey, they said the procedure was a success. The rock is gone. The system has been rebooted. It‚Äôs time to go home.

JUDAH: (His voice is slightly slurred but still calm) The data‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ inconsistent. My internal GPS indicates a deviation from my primary objective. I should not be in‚Ä¶ this room‚Ä¶ with these socks.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, you're fine. It's just the drugs. Here, let me help you.

She gently takes his socks and puts them on his feet the right way. A **NURSE**, a tired-looking moose, enters the room to check on him.

NURSE: Just make sure he takes it easy for the rest of the night. No strenuous activity.

JUDAH: (He looks at Princess Carolyn, then back at the nurse) My pre-surgical risk assessment module suggests a 67% chance that she will attempt to complete a full work-out and then outsource her call log to an off-shore call center.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey! I am a calm and reasonable person right now!

(The nurse just gives her a knowing look and leaves. Princess Carolyn sighs and helps Judah get into his clothes, a process that takes an uncomfortably long time.)

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Muttering to herself) This whole day has been a B-plot. And I am sick of it. I want to go home, I want to see my daughter, and I want to find a couch that doesn't smell like a bad career choice.

(She and Judah walk out of the hospital, into the quiet Los Angeles night. Judah is leaning on her slightly, his gaze fixed on the distance as if calculating a complex equation.)

JUDAH: The atmospheric data indicates a 100% chance of a pleasant evening.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Smiling slightly) Just wait, honey. The night is young.



# ACT 3: The Broken Canvas



**SCENE 9 INT. PRINCESS CAROLYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT**

The front door swings open, and Princess Carolyn steps inside, supporting a slightly wobbly Judah. He's still a little out of it, but his movements are starting to return to normal. Princess Carolyn, for the first time all day, lets out a long, weary sigh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: See? We made it. Home. The one place I thought I would never see again. Thank you, Judah, for not bleeding out in the car. It really would have complicated the upholstery insurance.

JUDAH: The familiar environmental parameters are a welcome relief. My system is recalibrating.

Princess Carolyn helps him to the couch. She closes her eyes for a moment, letting the quiet stillness of the house wash over her. It is perfect. For a single, fleeting second, she feels a sense of calm. Then, she opens her eyes.

Her jaw drops. Her exhausted relief vanishes instantly, replaced by sheer, unadulterated horror. She takes in the scene. The entire hallway wall is a canvas for Ruthie's art. **BoJack**, looking bewildered and covered in dried Sharpie, is sitting on the floor, holding a paintbrush he hasn't used yet.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (A high-pitched, strained voice) My... my wall... the paint‚Ä¶ the pristine, white, perfect paint! BoJack! What happened?!

BOJACK: (Defensively) Look, she's an artist! I couldn't stop her!

Princess Carolyn's eyes well up with tears of frustration. The stress of the day‚ÄîJudah's health, her failing company, the relentless calls, and now this‚Äîbecomes too much. She screams into a pillow.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Muffled) This is not a superpower! I'm not a superhero! I can't do it all! I'm just a‚Ä¶ a cat! Who's about to have a nervous breakdown!

BoJack looks at her and then at the wall. He takes a moment to actually look at Ruthie's art. The mural isn't random. It's a series of emotional images. The little cat mom chasing after clocks looks sad and exhausted. The porcupine dad in his suit is lost in the maze. The little girl is building the maze by herself. He sees his own reflection in a drawing of a sad-looking horse, looking over his shoulder. He also notices drawings of Todd and Maude, smiling, and other typical kids' drawings of rainbows and clouds, but her parents and herself are the central focus.

BOJACK: (Softly) You're right. It's not a superpower. It's just a regular power.

Princess Carolyn looks up, her face streaked with tears.

BOJACK: This isn't just a mess. Look at it. This is her. She's telling you a story. She's lonely. She misses you. She misses Judah. She's building her own world because you two are always so busy. She's not an artist. She‚Äôs a poet. She‚Äôs saying that she's okay being alone but you're a mess... in a good way.

Princess Carolyn looks at the mural again. She looks at her daughter, who is now asleep on the floor, a single black marker in her hand. She looks at BoJack, who has finally done something right. A wave of regret washes over her.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (A weary, but genuine sigh) You're right. It's beautiful. It's... a masterpiece.

She looks back and forth between the wall and BoJack, a sense of relief washing over her.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You know, it's funny... everything's been so great lately. Judah's been fantastic, Ruthie's growing up so fast. I thought... I thought getting married and having a family was the finale. Like, I finally got my happily ever after and I was done. But this... this is life. And it just keeps happening. And I'm not done yet.

BoJack just nods, listening. Princess Carolyn continues, her voice growing stronger.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It makes me think... maybe I should try to focus more on Ruthie. Maybe... I'll try to expand, outsource some of the work at VIM if I can. Given the current state of the industry, it's a work in progress, but we'll figure it out.

She walks over and gently pulls the paintbrush from his hand.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You know, you didn't screw this up. You genuinely did a good thing. It's... weird.

BOJACK: (Dryly) Thanks.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (Her smile widens) There he is! But really, BoJack. Thank you. I'll get you back for this. I mean it.

**SCENE 10 INT. PRINCESS CAROLYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT**

(Princess Carolyn is tucking a sleeping Ruthie into her bed. She looks around the room, which is still decorated with Ruthie's art. A peaceful silence fills the air. She walks back into the living room, where the massive mural still dominates the wall.)

(**Judah** is back from the hospital, now with his kidney stone removed, and is sitting on the couch, drinking a warm cup of herbal tea. He looks at Princess Carolyn, who is staring at the wall.)

JUDAH: It's quite a piece. She's very talented.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: (A sigh of relief) She is. She really is.

(**BoJack** stands awkwardly by the door, having put on his jacket and gotten ready to go home. He's been waiting for them to notice he's ready to leave.)

BOJACK: Well, uh... I guess I'm gonna head out.

(Princess Carolyn turns to him, a genuine smile on her face.)

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Thank you, BoJack. You really saved us.

BOJACK: Yeah. I know.

(He looks at Judah, who nods his head in a silent, respectful gesture.)

BOJACK: (Looking at the mural) So, uh... goodnight, I guess.

(He turns and walks out the door. The camera follows him as he walks down the street alone, the streetlights illuminating his solitary walk back to his small, empty apartment. BoJack unlocks his door, walks inside, and closes it behind him. He stands in the middle of his empty living room, the quietness deafening. He feels a small warmth from having done a good thing. He helped a friend, and he didn't mess it up. But the good feeling is fleeting. He looks around the sterile, undecorated room. The contrast between the warm, chaotic, and messy home he just left and his own quiet, solitary life is stark. He is still alone at the end of the day, with a small, sad sigh escaping his lips. He looks down at his hands, then up at his blank TV screen. The final shot is a close-up on the blank TV, a reflection of his empty existence.)



# Outro Music & Credits



(The music plays over the credits. The camera shows the title card of a show that Princess Carolyn and Judah are producing, it is about Ruthie, from her point of view.)

* Back in the 90's, I was in a Very Famous T\~ V\~ show! I'm BoJack, the Horse\~ ""BoJack!"" BoJack the Horse, Don't act like Youuuu Don't Know. And I'm trying, to Hold on To My Past...

1mrqelf,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovementday/comments/1mrqelf/i_was_crushed_by_my_diagnosis_but_this_simple/,"I was crushed by my diagnosis, but this simple practice brought me back","I used to think I was invincible. I was thirty, living in Texas, working as a programmer, and treating my body like an afterthought. All nighters on caffeine, drinking until sunrise, chain smoking whenever stress hit, doomscrolling until my eyes burned. If I could still show up to work, I figured I was fine.

Then came my company‚Äôs annual health check. I almost skipped it. But the report smacked me in the face: early stage chronic gastritis with erosions in my stomach lining. Not cancer. Not deadly‚Ä¶ yet. The doctor warned me that if I kept living like this, it could turn into something much worse.

At first, I brushed it off. Then the symptoms started: constant bloating, sharp stomach pains after heavy meals. I even got nauseous during the meetings. The worst was lying awake at 3 am, clutching my stomach, hating myself for ignoring the warning signs.

One random night, I was scrolling through my phone and came across a line from Papillon: ‚ÄúYour greatest sin is wasting your life.‚Äù I thought, If I died tomorrow, my legacy would be hangovers, a shelf of unread books, and a worn out laptop. That thought broke me.

I quit smoking overnight. Cut alcohol to maybe once a month. Set a strict bedtime, and keep my eyes shut, even when my mind refuses to rest. Started eating lighter, earlier dinners. I put screen limits on my phone and swapped late night scrolling for reading and listening to podcasts. The first week was hell. My body screamed for the old habits. But after a month, my mornings didn‚Äôt feel like a punishment anymore.
Reading became my anchor. Not just for distraction, but for rewiring my brain. Books gave me frameworks for discipline, self awareness, and long term thinking. A few standouts:
Atomic Habits by James Clear, this book ruined all my excuses. Clear makes behavior change feel not just simple but inevitable, with practical ways to break bad habits and replace them with small, consistent wins. I kept it on my desk like a manual. 

What I do is to pair that with The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer, which cracked open the realization that so much of my mental suffering was self created. If you‚Äôve ever felt trapped in your own head, his writing feels like someone opening a window to let fresh air in. 
And then, Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is just like a wakeup call for me. Realizing how much sleep fuels my health and mind turned me into a near saint about protecting my bedtime. Together, these books shifted how I live, my habits, my inner world, and even the way I rest.
When I felt too mentally drained for full books, I found a hack that kept me learning without frying my brain: BeFreed. A friend introduced me, it‚Äôs a smart reading and book summary app built by a team from Columbia University. Perfect for when you‚Äôre working full time & barely have energy left. It turns dense nonfiction into podcast style episodes in different lengths: 10 min quick hits, 20 min recaps, or 40 min deep dives. I even customized my podcast host to be a non judgemental, chill best friend. It feels like we are catching up over coffee. The AI actually learns about your life, struggles, and goals, like my adult ADHD and the demands of my job, and builds a personalized learning roadmap that adapts over time. Now I‚Äôve knocked out books I‚Äôd been ‚Äúmeaning to read‚Äù for years, The Selfish Gene,Cosmos, Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs made reading as addictive as doomscrolling.

I also leaned on other free, high value resources. The Ten Percent Happier Podcast gave me practical, mindfulness based tools for stress, sleep, and focus that I could apply immediately. The YouTube channel Better Ideas kept me inspired with short, cinematic takes on self discipline and meaning. Together, these turned my downtime into actual fuel for growth instead of a black hole.

Now my life is unrecognizable. I wake up earlier without hating it. I take morning walks. I cook for myself more than I order in. Nights out are about connection, not numbing myself. I‚Äôve been to Burningman, the Grand Canyon, Georgia coast, places I always said I‚Äôd go ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù I even started horseback riding and golf just to prove to myself I can still learn new skills.

The health checks still make me nervous, but they also remind me how far I‚Äôve come. They‚Äôre no longer about waiting for bad news, they‚Äôre proof I‚Äôm investing in myself. If I could go back, I‚Äôd start sooner. You don‚Äôt need a life threatening diagnosis to change your life.

# Best Beehive Cup 2025: Top Picks & Reviews

The beehive cup, also known as a honey dipper or honey wand, is an essential tool for any honey enthusiast. This simple yet elegant utensil is designed to extract honey from jars and drizzle it neatly without creating a sticky mess. Choosing the right beehive cup can significantly enhance your honey-eating experience, providing both functionality and aesthetic pleasure.

These cups come in various materials,sizes,and designs,catering to diverse preferences and needs. From classic wooden dippers to modern stainless-steel options, the market offers a wide range of choices. Whether you are a beekeeper, a honey connoisseur, or simply someone who enjoys the occasional drizzle of honey, finding the perfect beehive cup can elevate your daily routine.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a beehive cup involves considering several technical specifications that directly influence its performance and usability. Here's a detailed look at the key features to keep in mind.

**material:** The material of a beehive cup significantly impacts its durability, hygiene, and overall feel. Most common materials include wood,stainless steel,silicone,and glass.

Wooden beehive cups, frequently enough made from hardwoods like maple or cherry, offer a natural and rustic aesthetic. they are typically food-safe but require careful cleaning and drying to prevent bacteria growth or warping. Stainless steel cups are known for their durability and ease of cleaning, making them a hygienic choice. Silicone cups are flexible and heat-resistant, while glass cups provide a sophisticated look but are more fragile. Choosing a material depends on personal preferences for design, durability, and maintainance.

**Design:** The design of the beehive cup influences its ability to efficiently scoop and dispense honey without dripping. The ideal design features grooves or ridges that help the honey cling to the dipper.

The classic beehive shape, with its multiple horizontal rings, is designed to maximize honey retention. Modern designs may incorporate variations such as spirals or specialized dispensing mechanisms. The length of the handle is also a crucial design element, ensuring comfortable handling and preventing your hand from getting sticky. Users should consider the ease of use and effectiveness of the design when making their selection.

**Dimensions:** The overall size and weight of a beehive cup determine its suitability for different jar sizes and its ease of handling. A cup that is too short may not reach the bottom of taller jars, while one that is too large can be cumbersome to use.

Standard beehive cups typically range from 6 to 8 inches in length. the diameter of the dipper head, where the honey is collected, also varies. Lighter materials like wood or silicone make for easier handling, especially during prolonged use. Heavier materials such as stainless steel can feel more substantial but may cause fatigue over time. The user's hand size and strength should factor into this consideration.

**Cleaning & Maintenance:** The ease of cleaning and maintenance is a practical consideration that impacts the long-term usability of a beehive cup. Some materials and designs are easier to clean than others.

Stainless steel and silicone cups are generally dishwasher-safe, making them simple to maintain.Wooden cups require handwashing with mild soap and thorough drying to prevent damage. Intricate designs with deep grooves may require extra effort to clean thoroughly. Users should consider their cleaning preferences and time availability when choosing a beehive cup.

**Durability:** The durability of a beehive cup is a critical factor, ensuring the product can withstand regular use without breaking or deteriorating. The choice of material and construction quality significantly impact the longevity of the cup.

Stainless steel cups are highly durable and resistant to corrosion,while wooden cups are susceptible to cracking or warping if not properly cared for. Silicone and glass cups fall somewhere in between, with silicone being more resistant to cracking but glass being prone to shattering. The user should assess the expected level of use and storage conditions when selecting a durable beehive cup.## Core Benefits

The right beehive cup offers several practical benefits, enhancing the honey-eating experience while improving hygiene and convenience.

**Reduced Mess & drips:** The primary benefit of using a beehive cup is to minimize mess and prevent dripping. The traditional design with grooves ensures that the honey clings to the dipper instead of dripping uncontrollably. This makes drizzling honey over toast, yogurt, or tea much cleaner and more enjoyable. No more sticky countertops or messy hands.

**Precise Honey Dispensing:** A beehive cup allows for more precise control over the amount of honey dispensed. Unlike spoons or knives, the dipper's design enables you to easily control the flow, ensuring you get just the right amount of honey without overdoing it. This is particularly useful for recipes where accurate measurements are essential. Whether it‚Äôs a touch of sweetness in your morning coffee or a glaze on your roasted vegetables,achieving consistent results is easy with the right dipper.

**Enhanced Presentation:** The use of a beehive cup can elevate the presentation of your honey. The elegant design adds a touch of sophistication to your table setting, making the act of serving and enjoying honey more refined. Whether hosting a brunch or simply enjoying a quiet breakfast, a beautifully crafted beehive cup turns a simple moment into something a bit more extraordinary.

**Hygienic Use:** A dedicated beehive cup promotes better hygiene compared to using shared utensils. By having a specific tool for honey, you avoid cross-contamination with other foods and keep your honey jar cleaner. This is especially critically important in households with multiple users or when serving guests. Maintaining hygiene is critical in preserving the overall quality and taste of your honey.

**Long-Term Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a beehive cup may seem trivial, it helps to reduce the waste of honey that can be left behind on spoons and knives. Because the dipper is designed to collect and dispense honey efficiently, the amount of honey being wasted is less. Over time, this reduced waste can lead to cost savings, especially for those who are frequent honey eaters.

At first, I brushed it off. Then the symptoms started: constant bloating, sharp stomach pains after heavy meals. I even got nauseous during the meetings. The worst was lying awake at 3 am, clutching my stomach, hating myself for ignoring the warning signs.

One random night, I was scrolling through my phone and came across a line from Papillon: ‚ÄúYour greatest sin is wasting your life.‚Äù I thought, If I died tomorrow, my legacy would be hangovers, a shelf of unread books, and a worn out laptop. That thought broke me.

I quit smoking overnight. Cut alcohol to maybe once a month. Set a strict bedtime, and keep my eyes shut, even when my mind refuses to rest. Started eating lighter, earlier dinners. I put screen limits on my phone and swapped late night scrolling for reading and listening to podcasts. The first week was hell. My body screamed for the old habits. But after a month, my mornings didn‚Äôt feel like a punishment anymore.
Reading became my anchor. Not just for distraction, but for rewiring my brain. Books gave me frameworks for discipline, self awareness, and long term thinking. A few standouts:
Atomic Habits by James Clear, this book ruined all my excuses. Clear makes behavior change feel not just simple but inevitable, with practical ways to break bad habits and replace them with small, consistent wins. I kept it on my desk like a manual. 

What I do is to pair that with The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer, which cracked open the realization that so much of my mental suffering was self created. If you‚Äôve ever felt trapped in your own head, his writing feels like someone opening a window to let fresh air in. 
And then, Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is just like a wakeup call for me. Realizing how much sleep fuels my health and mind turned me into a near saint about protecting my bedtime. Together, these books shifted how I live, my habits, my inner world, and even the way I rest.
When I felt too mentally drained for full books, I found a hack that kept me learning without frying my brain: BeFreed. A friend introduced me, it‚Äôs a smart reading and book summary app built by a team from Columbia University. Perfect for when you‚Äôre working full time & barely have energy left. It turns dense nonfiction into podcast style episodes in different lengths: 10 min quick hits, 20 min recaps, or 40 min deep dives. I even customized my podcast host to be a non judgemental, chill best friend. It feels like we are catching up over coffee. The AI actually learns about your life, struggles, and goals, like my adult ADHD and the demands of my job, and builds a personalized learning roadmap that adapts over time. Now I‚Äôve knocked out books I‚Äôd been ‚Äúmeaning to read‚Äù for years, The Selfish Gene,Cosmos, Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs made reading as addictive as doomscrolling.

I also leaned on other free, high value resources. The Ten Percent Happier Podcast gave me practical, mindfulness based tools for stress, sleep, and focus that I could apply immediately. The YouTube channel Better Ideas kept me inspired with short, cinematic takes on self discipline and meaning. Together, these turned my downtime into actual fuel for growth instead of a black hole.

Now my life is unrecognizable. I wake up earlier without hating it. I take morning walks. I cook for myself more than I order in. Nights out are about connection, not numbing myself. I‚Äôve been to Burningman, the Grand Canyon, Georgia coast, places I always said I‚Äôd go ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù I even started horseback riding and golf just to prove to myself I can still learn new skills.

The health checks still make me nervous, but they also remind me how far I‚Äôve come. They‚Äôre no longer about waiting for bad news, they‚Äôre proof I‚Äôm investing in myself. If I could go back, I‚Äôd start sooner. You don‚Äôt need a life threatening diagnosis to change your life.

The house was wrapped in a subdued opulence, like a mansion masquerading as a lakeside cottage. The owner was wealthy, that was immediately apparent.

I was a knotted mess of nerves as I lifted a fist and knocked on the front door.

I looked back to my car with its sun-stained roof in the driveway, parked beside an extravagant fountain surrounded by expertly manicured hedges. It looked just as out of place as me. 

The man I was expecting did not answer the door, to my relief, but instead I was met with an older woman with white hair and yapping pomeranians at her ankles.

‚ÄúHello, my name is Charlie,‚Äù I said nervously. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been sent by the publisher to talk to Mr. Montgomery.‚Äù

She nodded and her eyelids dropped in exhausted understanding. She jerked her head backwards, using a free leg to keep the pocket sized dogs at bay. ‚ÄúSterling! It‚Äôs for you!‚Äù 

Turning back to me she said, ‚ÄúI knew one of you would come here eventually. He‚Äôs been in one of his moods‚Ä¶‚Äù and then she leaned in and whispered, ‚Äúhiding in his office.‚Äù

She was right. Sterling Montgomery had been out of contact for some time. Over six months now. He hadn‚Äôt responded to our phone calls or emails, and he had a book overdue which we had paid an advance for over six years ago. He was no longer the flagship of the publishing house I worked for, but twenty years ago you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a bigger author anywhere. But he was still an important member of our roster, and I was the person selected to reestablish contact.

The old woman stepped aside, and I was greeted by an elderly man fumbling to put on his glasses. His hair was gray, thin and receding, and complemented by a short white beard with a shock of black at the center. He wore a loose-fitting polo shirt and dress pants that his stomach hung just over. He stared at me, looking me up down‚Äîmaybe sizing me up. He was known as a scrapper, a pugnacious man in his youth, and I was half-certain he would lift me up by the scruff of my neck and vault me from his property. Maybe the man in his author photo, emblazoned on the back of his books, could have managed that, but this was a man well into his eighties, and I think that strength had left him long ago.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù he grumbled, squinting.

‚ÄúMy name is Charlie. I‚Äôm from the publisher,‚Äù I repeated. ‚ÄúCan I speak with you for a moment?‚Äù

He raised an aged hand to rub his temple, and although wrinkled and stained with liver spots, they were large with wide, thick square fingernails. In his prime, they no doubt could have delivered a powerful left jab and immediate right cross‚Äîthe proper way to win a fight.

‚ÄúWell, it appears I am discovered,‚Äù he said, his voice low and a bit operatic.

I smiled meekly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually a pleasure to meet you, I‚Äôm an enormous fan.‚Äù This was true. ‚ÄúYour books are what inspired me to pursue writing myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúA writer then!‚Äù he perked up and made a toothy grin, revealing a mouth full of overly-white veneers. ‚ÄúAnd here I thought they‚Äôd send a blood sucking lawyer to serve me, or some intern offered up as a blood sacrifice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe latter may be closer to the truth,‚Äù I replied, honestly.

‚ÄúCome on in and tell me about yourself. We‚Äôll get some whiskey and you can get to know the real me. The one everybody hates!‚Äù He chuckled and moved aside with a welcoming arm guiding me inward.

The home was immaculate, adorned with bronze statues, paintings, and rows of leatherbounds tucked into towering bookshelves. My assumption was that its cleanliness was more due to the efforts of the woman than him. 

He gestured to her, ‚ÄúMy wife, Miriam.‚Äù She nodded as she moved towards a white couch in the large, high-ceilinged living room, the dogs leaping up into her lap. Floor to ceiling windows covered the exterior wall, revealing a beautiful vista of green grass and a large lake that punctuated the center of the property.

‚ÄúThe lake is beautiful,‚Äù I said.

Miriam‚Äôs mood shifted and she said solemnly, ‚ÄúNo. There‚Äôs a toxic algae. We lost our boy to it in twenty-twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWe had no idea, and suddenly he went into what the emergency vet thought was anaphylactic shock. Then he was gone.‚Äù

I furrowed my brows instinctively. ‚ÄúYou took your son to a vet?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Our boys,‚Äù she said, laying a hand on one of the pomeranians, stroking its back.

‚ÄúCome on Charlie,‚Äù said Sterling, directing me down a hallway with a thick hand. ‚ÄúSo what is it you‚Äôve been charged with doing? Getting a book out of me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs part of it. I was also looking forward to finally meeting you. Maybe, selfishly, extracting some writing advice for myself.‚Äù This was also true.

Sterling Montgomery paused. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre a writer looking for advice who‚Äôs come to get a book from a writer that doesn‚Äôt write? You‚Äôre in a most unenviable position, it seems.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo there hasn‚Äôt been much progress?‚Äù

Sterling smiled, the wrinkles on his face collected at the corners of his eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll discuss it. Right this way.‚Äù

He walked with a swagger of confidence, a gait beyond a man of his age, and led me down a stairwell into a furnished basement. ‚ÄúThis is where I do my work. It‚Äôs quiet here, and always a cool, consistent temperature.‚Äù

The basement had high ceilings like the rest of the home, with an orange carpeted pit at the center with built-in cushions like something out of the 70s. Beside it was a wooden wet bar, stolen straight from a spaghetti western. He shuffled over and began clinking glasses and pouring an amber liquid. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve led such an amazing life,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt must be nice to relax here.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a prison,‚Äù he said, not looking up as he poured. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old to have fun anymore. You spend your whole life living as big as you can, and it takes a toll on your body. Now those stairs are all I can manage.‚Äù

He gestured for me to sit in the carpeted pit. And I sat, sinking down into the gaudy cushions. Leagues beneath him and his tall form.

‚ÄúComfortable, eh? The cushions are Moroccan.‚Äù He handed me a glass. I gingerly took a sip with him, and I was hit with the burning taste of scotch whiskey, and exhaled what felt like campfire smoke from my nostrils. He kept his eyes locked on me as he sipped, watching my reaction. I did my best to stifle a cough, to not embarrass myself in front of him.

He looked pleased.

‚ÄúSo what do you write, Charlie?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm still working on my first novel. But I have been published. Mostly short stories and literary non-fiction from small academic presses. Nothing of note, really.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôre part of the system. A publisher. Tired of the gatekeeping, so you became a gatekeeper, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess, maybe.‚Äù I felt vulnerable now. Might as well tell the truth. ‚ÄúWriting is something I love, and I thought I could improve and learn more about the industry from the inside. Have you thought of doing an autobiography? Maybe talking about your publishing career and your life?‚Äù

He set his glass down on a coffee table in the middle of the sunken lounge. ‚ÄúI would never write a memoir. They‚Äôre an absolute hustle. Oh, woe is me, my life is so sad. Come, hear how sad my life is, please let me share my pain with you.‚Äù The words were sarcastic. ‚ÄúBut, wait, not so fast. Twenty dollars first. This is some good, high-quality personal tragedy, guilt, and abuse. Some really juicy stuff. It‚Äôs worth at least a buck and you gotta pay for it.‚Äù He raised his hands in the air. ‚ÄúNow they‚Äôre on a press tour, flying first class, staying in nice hotels, getting drunk in lobby bars on the high shelf stuff. But they have to keep a straight face while they‚Äôre snickering in secret knowing they scammed us all.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll be writing a memoir.‚Äù 

He retrieved his glass and took another healthy sip.

‚ÄúIt must be interesting, though,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWrestling bears in Alaska, fighting up fish in Cuba, and getting into brawls in Paris.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just emulating the people before me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Europeans don‚Äôt have the fight in them anymore.‚Äù

He sat across from me. He didn‚Äôt lower into the cushions as I had. Instead, his heavy, masculine form seemed too dense to sink.

‚ÄúWhat about writing? You must have some kind of insight to writing. How you found inspiration, got published, and maybe some advice I could glean for myself. I‚Äôm still a novice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I began. I was an idiot kid and wrote a short story while tripping on mushrooms in my dorm room. I Xeroxed it, stapled it into a zine, and passed it out at bars to impress girls. I thought myself quite the writer.‚Äù
He took another sip from his glass. ‚ÄúNobody cared. Nobody ever does. Then four years later I get a phone call. A woman had found my zine and wanted to publish it. I didn‚Äôt know it, but a copy had found its way to a coffee shop, buried amongst magazines. Its edges had been used to rags and its staples were rusted and close to snapping. The term she used was well-loved. She thought people had been reading it. But I don‚Äôt agree. I think it had been kicked around, spill-stained, and discarded so many times it was almost illegible because people didn‚Äôt care. It was garbage meandering self-important bullshit. But who was I to argue? I was going to be published. Then she took it and rewrote it. Hell, she wrote most of it. Made herself a lot of money, and I got the fame. I got the attention.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe must have known it was a good book, though, right? Why else would she want to publish it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you the truth, Charlie.‚Äù He spun the liquid in his glass, the ice clanking as he did. ‚ÄúThe truth is you have to know your writing is shit. It all is. Then one of these women finds something they like, a little pearl all covered in blemishes they know they‚Äôre skilled enough to buff out. You think you‚Äôre a genius and finally someone recognized your talent, and they‚Äôre so fortunate to have found your manuscript in piles of shit. They do that, they prey on your ego to get what they want, which is a publishable book. A product. You expect these fine, delicate hands to help guide your greatness‚Äîif only this sweet angel could whisper the right words to inspire your creative genius, you could produce poetry, a literary masterpiece. But that ain‚Äôt it‚Äîit‚Äôs all prodding over and over, and they put in their little notes to get it just how they want it. And none of us had the goddamn self-awareness to know just how shit we were. They never tell you that. They say there‚Äôs not enough women in publishing? It‚Äôs been women since the start. There‚Äôs a reason all the great men like Hemingway and Fitzgerald met at Gertrude Stein's house. Those are her books. They just got their names on the cover because men had the money and men bought the books. But literature, it‚Äôs always been women. That‚Äôs what they do, they manipulate men to write the stories they like, take fifteen percent, and live their life sipping tea in some perfect little garden and read it to their girlfriends because they‚Äôre also all lesbians.‚Äù

I tried to stay composed, expressionless as he continued.

‚ÄúJesus fuck, I‚Äôve got to get this book done and these goddamn dikes won‚Äôt help anymore. It‚Äôs men that are getting pushed out of publishing. They don‚Äôt need our egos or wallets anymore. Now it‚Äôs just tea, gardens, and lesbian sex all day, and they‚Äôre doing it with my fifteen percent! Men, we‚Äôre the ones going out of print.‚Äù Then he took a long drag of his drink, finishing it to the last drop. ‚ÄúWhat university published your work?‚Äù

‚ÄúBerkley,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAlthough I went to university on the East Coast.‚Äù

‚ÄúUniversities can suck my nuts,‚Äù spat Sterling. ‚ÄúYou want to know how the rich fuck us? Universities. That‚Äôs where they hide their money. They call them endowments, but what they really are is unregistered tax shelters where rich people‚Äôs money is being invested. That money‚Äôs not building a library, it‚Äôs opening a factory in Myanmar to suck away even more American manufacturing jobs. These schools are worth hundreds of billions. The wealthy run all kinds of scams, like fine art. Buying and selling art in shady back room deals, silent auctions and all that. When it benefits you the painting‚Äôs worth millions, and when it hurts you it‚Äôs positively worthless. And then when you get slapped with a tax bill for a million dollars, suddenly that painting is worth a million dollars again and you can write all of it off by donating it. And who appraises the value of that painting? The universities. And where does it get donated to? The universities. It is a lethal system built on predatory behavior that benefits only the people at the top.‚Äù

Sterling rose from his Moroccan cushions and headed back to the wet bar.

‚ÄúSterling, you‚Äôre wealthy. I know how much we pay you in residuals. It‚Äôs pretty substantial.‚Äù

‚ÄúResiduals are a curse. You would think money arriving in the mail each month, money you didn‚Äôt work for, money that seemingly appears out of nowhere, would be some great boon. Some great benefit. But it‚Äôs not. Free money should be liberating, but instead it holds you down‚Äîlike a weight around your neck. People need to work, need to stay busy. Otherwise we rot and decay and fall victim to our vices. When you give a million dollars to an idiot, you don‚Äôt make a millionaire, you give him a million ways to destroy himself. And if he survives, he‚Äôll end up with nothing.‚Äù

He put aside the small glass and produced a pint from beneath the bar, and began filling it with ice and whiskey.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why rich people are so stingy with money. You think, why don‚Äôt they just give out money if they‚Äôve got so much? Because it doesn‚Äôt help anyone to give them money. What people need is changed behavior. Money doesn‚Äôt fix that. But that‚Äôs how people are, they think all their problems come from bad luck‚Äîthe universe conspiring against them. But the truth is that it‚Äôs almost always just people making bad choices‚Äîacting on impulse. Why save a penny when you can bust a buck?‚Äù

Sterling took a long drag from the pint glass, lumbered back over, and took a seat. He had a wobble now, it was clear. I knew then that these weren‚Äôt his first drinks today.

‚ÄúYou know the book Goodnight Moon? My mother read it to me as a boy. The author died at just forty years old by a botched surgery in France. Left all the money to a neighborhood boy she took a shine to. He squandered the money. He spent his life homeless, in and out of jail, all while getting million dollar checks in the mail. By his own admission he doesn‚Äôt even like the book. I‚Äôm not much different. The publisher sells the books and I have nothing to do with it. You guys write the checks and part of that arrangement is that I shut up and keep my nose clean. Every year there‚Äôs a new edition with a fancy new cover, or a new deal with the libraries, or some big shot producer buying the rights for a movie. They never make the movie, and you don‚Äôt want them to. Most authors make more money loaning out rights over and over than seeing their story become a shit daytime movie of the week that‚Äôs quickly forgotten. The most painful thing about film is that the actors are sent out on the press tour‚Äîpeople who did not write, create, or produce the film. It‚Äôs theater kids pretending to understand deep, philosophical poetry even though their only contribution was reading it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seem to have done well with it. You have this house.‚Äù I raised my hands, motioning to the fine accoutrements and vaulted ceiling.

He laughed into his glass. ‚ÄúI do. And ten acres around it.‚Äù His eyes shot up with a gleam. ‚ÄúYou want to shoot guns?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, thanks.‚Äù The idea terrified me. ‚ÄúAbout your book. Have you made any progress? The publisher really wants to know.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot enough to show the greedy eyes of those editors.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs kind of imperative that you get back on track. They would really like to see something from you soon. They told me that the market is changing, and you‚Äôll be better received now than in the future.‚Äù

Sterling seemed to ignore my words. ‚ÄúWe should shoot guns.‚Äù

And there I was, standing in a grassy field on his property, with a shotgun strapped to my back‚Äîsomething I had never held before.

‚ÄúPull!‚Äù he yelled, his shotgun fixed under his jaw.

‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThrow the pigeon!‚Äù

I used all my strength and hucked it out like a frisbee high into the air in front of me. Sterling followed the path of the clay disk with the barrel of his shotgun, then fired, exploding it into sherds. Sherds being the proper term for broken ceramics, and shards being the term for broken glass.

‚ÄúAha!‚Äù he cheered. ‚ÄúYour turn.‚Äù",0,1755336399.0,writers,1,0.5,False

Most people think of Ethiopia, Colombia, or Brazil when they think of quality beans ‚Äî but Thailand, especially the northern region of Chiang Rai, is producing some truly remarkable coffee.

For those who, like me, enjoy **dark roast coffee beans**, Thai Arabica offers something special:

* **Rich body** that holds up well even when roasted darker.
* **Smooth bitterness** without being harsh.
* **Flavor notes** that often lean toward dark chocolate, roasted nuts, and subtle spice.
* **Sustainable farming** ‚Äî many small farms in Chiang Rai grow coffee under shade, often alongside other crops.

I recently tried a **dark roast Arabica from Chiang Rai** that surprised me with how balanced it was. Instead of being burnt or overly smoky (a common risk with dark roasts), it kept a clean profile while still delivering that strong, bold cup I love in the morning.

For anyone curious, here‚Äôs the roastery I ordered from: [‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏•‡πá‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏≤‡πÅ‡∏ü‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏°](https://petraroastery.com/product/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9F%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B1%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A7%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2/)

But beyond this one, I think Thai dark roast in general deserves more attention. It‚Äôs affordable compared to many other origins, and the flavor profile is well-suited for espresso, French press, or even a simple moka pot.

Curious to hear from others:

* Have you tried coffee from Thailand before?
* Do you think dark roast gets unfairly criticized in the specialty coffee world?
* What origins do you usually prefer for dark roasts?",1,1755336136.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The moast effective walker trays offer a combination of stability, durability, and user-amiable design. We will delve into the critical features that set the top models apart.

**Surface area and Dimensions:**

The surface area of the walker tray is a crucial factor to consider, as it determines the amount of space available for carrying items.Models with larger surface areas, typically around 16"" x 12"" or greater, can accommodate full meals, multiple books, or larger personal items. These trays often feature raised edges to prevent items from sliding off. Smaller trays, around 12"" x 9"", are more compact and maneuverable, suitable for carrying smaller items such as a cup of coffee, a phone, or a small book.The depth of the tray, which determines the size of the lip, is also critically important. Deeper trays typically offer greater spill protection.

**Material and Durability:**

the material used in the construction of the walker tray directly impacts its durability and weight. Common materials include high-density polyethylene (HDPE), ABS plastic, and sometimes even lightweight aluminum. HDPE is known for its impact resistance and ability to withstand daily wear and tear. ABS plastic is also durable but might potentially be more susceptible to scratching. Aluminum, while lightweight and sturdy, can be more expensive. Look for trays with reinforced edges and a stable design to ensure they can handle the weight of the items carried without bending or breaking. Non-slip surfaces are also highly desirable to prevent items from sliding around during movement.

**Attachment Mechanism:**

The method used to attach the walker tray to the walker is a crucial factor for both stability and ease of use. Most trays utilize a clip-on or hook-and-loop (Velcro) system. Clip-on trays offer a more secure attachment, frequently enough featuring locking mechanisms to prevent accidental detachment. Though, they may require more effort to install and remove. Hook-and-loop systems are easier to use but may not provide the same level of stability, especially with heavier items. It is indeed critically important to ensure that the attachment mechanism is compatible with the specific model of walker being used. Some trays also feature adjustable straps to accommodate different walker widths.

**Weight Capacity:**

The weight capacity of the walker tray directly correlates to the types of items that can be safely carried. Most walker trays have a weight capacity ranging from 5 to 10 pounds. Exceeding the weight capacity can compromise the stability of the walker and perhaps lead to accidents. It's best to choose a tray with a weight capacity that exceeds your typical carrying needs to provide an extra margin of safety. Consider the composition of the items that you expect to regularly carry. If you depend on your walker tray to bring dinner plates from the kitchen, go for a higher weight capacity to avoid any problems later!

**Ease of Cleaning:**

Hygiene is always key when dealing with mobility assistance devices that might be used while consuming food. The ease of cleaning is a practical consideration, especially for users who may be prone to spills or messes to clean. Smooth, non-porous surfaces are easier to wipe down with a damp cloth or disinfectant wipe. Trays with removable inserts or dishwasher-safe components further simplify the cleaning process. Avoid trays with intricate designs or textures that can trap dirt and debris.

**Foldability & Storage:**

Some walker trays are designed to fold away temporarily as you place your walker in a confined space, thereby increasing its portability and saving space.

## Core Benefits

A well-designed walker tray can significantly enhance the user's independence, safety, and overall quality of life.Here are some of the key benefits it provides.**Enhanced Independence:** The walker tray empowers individuals to independently transport meals, drinks, personal items, and medications, without the assistance of others. This fosters a sense of self-reliance and control over their daily activities.Instead of having to ask for help carrying food or other items from one room to another,users can confidently navigate their home or community on their own.**Improved Safety:** The tray reduces the risk of accidents by allowing users to keep both hands on the walker handles while moving. This is particularly critically important for individuals with balance or mobility issues who are normally at considerable risk. By removing the need to juggle items, the tray promotes stability and reduces the likelihood of falls. This is especially useful when navigating uneven surfaces.

**Increased Convenience:** The walker tray transforms the walker into a mobile platform, making it easy to accomplish everyday tasks. Users can use the tray to hold reading materials, organize craft supplies, or even serve as a temporary workspace. This turns the walker into a personalized ""command center"" that adapts to the user's needs.

**reduced Strain:** Carrying items without a tray can put excessive strain on the arms, back, and shoulders. The tray distributes the weight evenly, reducing physical exertion and promoting better posture. This benefit is especially critically important for individuals with arthritis or other musculoskeletal conditions.**Social Engagement:** By increasing mobility and convenience, the walker tray helps individuals to more actively participate in social activities, such as family gatherings, visits with friends, or community events.This ability to actively participate combats isolation and promotes social interaction.

I‚Äôm going on my first trip to Seoul in a few weeks and I‚Äôm a bit confused about all these payment methods.

I live in a country where credit cards aren‚Äôt really a thing and only debit cards (mastercards or visa cards) are used and given.  Cashless payment is still not that common here to be fair. 

Thing is I‚Äôm afraid my card would get declined (mainly because it has a pin system and even thought i have activated international transactions) so I thought I‚Äôd just stick to cash just to be safe. 

My question is : would only using cash be limiting? I would like the option of being able to try all different things and I don‚Äôt know how common these places that only accept card are (would still like to be able to try trendy coffees go shopping ect)

Here‚Äôs what gets me:  

- **AliExpress:**  
  ‚Ä¢ Crazy low prices, seriously sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs just too good to be real.  
  ‚Ä¢ Huge range of random, niche, oddly-specific items that you‚Äôll *never* find on Amazon.  
  ‚Ä¢ But‚Ä¶ the shipping times can feel like an eternity (and sometimes the tracking page is basically hieroglyphics).  
  ‚Ä¢ Risk factor‚Äîyou could get a win, or you could get a mystery item that looks nothing like the photos.  

- **Amazon:**  
  ‚Ä¢ Instant gratification. Boom, next-day prime shipping and it‚Äôs on your doorstep.  
  ‚Ä¢ More trustworthy for brand names, higher quality, and reliable returns.  
  ‚Ä¢ BUT‚Äîprices are almost always higher, and you lose the ‚Äúcheap thrill‚Äù of bargain hunting.  
  ‚Ä¢ Feels like you‚Äôre paying extra for convenience (and for Jeff Bezos‚Äôs coffee fund).  

And yet, even knowing all of this, somehow I still end up scrolling through both every week, adding to wishlists I‚Äôll probably never complete, like I‚Äôm living two shopping lives in parallel universes.  

To be real‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs not even about the product. It‚Äôs how it makes you feel. On Amazon, I feel ‚Äúefficient‚Äù and ‚Äúproductive.‚Äù On AliExpress, I feel like an explorer digging for treasure on the internet. Which vibe do I want today, right?

Wondering how long I should try toughing it out...","I've been on like 150mg for years. However, I noticed I've like normalized being super groggy a lot of the day. Also It's become way less effective. I either need to reset or maybe try my luck with some natural stuff for now. I've been having to take it multiple times a night from waking up and I haven't been sleeping as long, maybe 6h (although I know thats still decent).

However, I've noticed I've had this like lack of motivation and interest in things and I'm wondering how messed up my serotonin could be from being on this so long.

So I'm hoping to quit trazodone and try all the natural stuff, but I probably shouldn't get my hopes too high? Although it seems like some of you just rough neck and it rock out low sleep and eventually it can break and you can get a full night? I'm thinking of toughing it out a little while and if my mental health gets too bad I can always cave and go back on the trazodone.

Here is the list of what I'm trying:

Melatonin, Valerian Root, GABA, Glycine, Aplgenin, Magnesium Glycinate, 5-htp, Vitamin B8, Ashwaganda + theanine, Chamomille tea.

Now some of those are just vitamins and amino acids, but they are a rather high dose, maybe it will make an impact? Although I know of you are probably rolling your eyes at the natural stuff, and I don't blame you, but if I'm gonna quit my sleeping pill, may as well stack on everything I can on top of sleep hygiene.

1mrpuvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetOutOfBed/comments/1mrpuvt/how_to_wake_up_at_5am_every_day_without_feeling/,How to wake up at 5AM every day (without feeling exhausted),"I used to be the person who hit snooze 7 times and rolled out of bed at 8:47AM in a panic. The idea of waking up at 5AM seemed impossible like asking me to fly.

Six months later, I wake up at 5AM naturally. No alarm clock battles, no dragging myself out of bed. 

Here's exactly how I did it:

Start with your evening, not your morning

Step 1: Work backwards from 5AM. You need 7-8 hours of sleep. That means bed by 9-10PM. Non-negotiable. You can't cheat sleep and expect miracles.

Step 2: Create a wind-down routine At 8PM, I start dimming lights and putting devices away. Read for 30 minutes, maybe some light stretching. Your brain needs time to shift into sleep mode.

Step 3: Make 5AM worth waking up for. Have something you're excited about waiting for you. For me, it's perfect coffee and 30 minutes of reading before the world wakes up. Find your carrot.

The actual morning strategy:

Week 1: Move your alarm 15 minutes earlier every 3 days. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Your body will revolt. Gradual change lets your circadian rhythm adjust naturally.

Week 2-3: Use the 5-4-3-2-1 method When the alarm goes off, count down from 5 and force yourself up at 1. No thinking, no negotiating. Just move your body out of bed immediately.

Week 4+: Build the habit. By now your body clock is adjusting. The key is consistency‚Äîeven on weekends. Your brain doesn't understand ""cheat days.""

A trick I like to do is to put your alarm across the room You have to physically get up to turn it off. Once you're standing, you're 80% of the way there.

Drink a full glass of water immediately Your body is dehydrated after 8 hours. Water kickstarts your system better than coffee.

Get sunlight ASAP Open curtains or step outside for 2 minutes. Natural light tells your brain ""it's time to be awake.""

Have your clothes ready Decision fatigue is real at 5AM. Lay everything out the night before so you can function on autopilot.

The mindset shift that changed everything: Stop thinking ""I have to wake up early"" and start thinking ""I get to have quiet morning time."" which is true. I am feel more calm and at peace every time I wake up early. 

What to expect:

* Week 1: You'll hate everything
* Week 2: Still hard but doable
* Week 3: Starting to feel natural
* Week 4+: You'll wonder why you didn't do this sooner

The secret isn't willpower but  designing a system that makes it easier to wake up than stay in bed.

What time do you naturally wake up? I used to wake up at 7am due to work stress. But after learning to manage stress I've been able to turn that into 5am. ",5,1755335097.0,GetOutOfBed,0,1.0,False

1mrpu39,https://i.redd.it/4igmku1np8jf1.jpeg,"And We're Off by Dana Schwartz - a tale of a dull, vapid narcissist with artistic ambitions taking her overbearing mother on one of the dullest Eurotrips and journeys of self-discovery ever written. An exasperating and irritating bore of literature.","I've had prior exposures to this author, even before reading this dreadful book. The prior exposures have not gone well, either. One was a book while the other was her involvement in a television show. I read *The White Man's Guide to White Male Writers of the Western Canon* and **hated** it. It was her attempt at satire, lampooning white male authors and stereotypes about white male readers/budding white male writers. It was a boring, unfunny disaster that had absolutely nothing interesting or insightful to say about anything (The satire can be summed up as, ""White guys...am I right?"" This turd of a book was over 240 pages and that was the gist of the satire. I kind of like the illustrations at least. It's not like there was anything else worth looking at, as her words had less depth than the paper they're printed on. I imagine it's only funny in the super progressive crowds Schwartz runs in and appeals to no one else).

My second experience was through the television show, *She Hulk: Attorney at Law*, in which she wrote the episode, *Mean, Green, and Straight Poured into These Jeans*. It was also terrible, though to be fair to Schwartz, it's not like her episode was the worst (Pick your poison. Every episode of *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law* was terrible. It was a horrid rip-off of *Legally Blonde* and various romantic comedies, stretched into a television show, and given a superhero skin suit).

We're not off to a great start to say the least. A god-awful satire and participating in a god-awful television show doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Still, I was willing to give her another chance, so I decided to read *And We're Off*. Well, that was a mistake.

In this novel, we follow 17-year-old Nora Holmes, an aspiring artist who hopes to one day be as famous and acclaimed as her grandfather, Robert Parker, who is a world-renowned artist. For now, she does commissions on Tumblr and has a blog called Ophelia in Paradise. She mainly does fan art such as:

""...the drawing I'm working on of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy making out.""

Yes, that kind of fan art. Other kinds as well, but no one really remembers the more family-friendly material.

Much to her delight, Nora has been accepted to be part of an exclusive summer art program in Ireland - the Donegal Colony of Young Artists (Or ""The Deece"" to be annoyingly trendy), in which only a very small handful of students from around the world are accepted. Not only that, but before even getting to Ireland, she'll spend a few days in Paris and Ghent (Belgium) After Ireland comes Florence and London - all paid for by her grandfather.

What could be more exciting than a trip to Europe at such a young age? Plus, it'll give her some time to escape from her personal life troubles. Her mother, Alice, is overbearing and still struggling to come to grips from getting divorced two years prior. Her father has remarried (His new wife is Nora's former math teacher) and is moving to another state. She still pines after a boy named Nick, who took her virginity and then wanted nothing more to do with her. Now Nick is dating her best friend, Lena (Who has no idea Nora and Nick hooked up) and Nora can't help but stalk Nick's social media posts. She also has to decide on her future, such as her college ambitions while her mother chews her out for wasting her time on art and the awful green streak dyed in her hair.

The fantasies about traveling Europe, meeting other young people, and perhaps even finding a Prince Charming abroad all suddenly screech to a halt when Alice decides she'll be accompanying her daughter on this trip to Europe, much to Nora's confusion and irritation (With Nora taking too long to figure out how her mother's law office could possibly allow for a weeks-long trip to Europe on such short notice). Oh, well. Her mother promises to only be there for part of the trip, and Nora has been given folders from her grandfather that are labeled for each city she's set to visit. Each one is some sort of assignment and she is not to open the folders until she reaches these places.

So begins a journey of self-discovery, very brief tours of Europe, exploring the arts, young love, and reconnecting a distant relationship between a mother and a daughter.

There's a good idea here. It's just that Dana Schwartz never actually assembles anything compelling out of these parts. Any of these individual parts could have made for something good, yet not a single aspect of the plot works.

The first mistake is the main character herself. I hated Nora Holmes every step of the way from beginning to end. She's an insufferable, faux quirky sort of character who thinks she's so special, when in reality, she seems to be built entirely out of the most annoying stereotypes of millennial and Gen-Z girls. So much so, she could have come from a factory assembly line. For starters, here's how she describes what she hates and what she likes, which happens near the end of the story as she writes one final letter to her Irish love interest, Callum Cassidy, before departing for Florence:

""**Things I Hate:**

* The color orange
* The smacking sound my mom's lips make before she's about to say something
* Boys with gauges in their ears
* Chalky fingers after using pastels
* Jazz music, the fast kind that makes me anxious
* The thin, pasty, flat strands that stick to a banana after you peel it

""**Things I Like:**

* Brie cheese
* The ding from a text message
* Wearing a bathrobe after a shower
* Ginger tea
* Squeezing paint out of an aluminum tube
* Maybe you. Probably you. Definitely you.""

Nora, even if I hadn't read the rest of the book leading up to this point, I'm still bored by you. There's more to list, but I assure you, she impressively becomes more vapid and boring. This is made worse by the author herself. She's part of the crowd who complain about portrayals of women in media and other things, yet has crafted a character who is indistinguishable from a number of females from romantic comedies - worse yet, from the BAD romantic comedies.

Other things I've learned about Nora:

* She loves Taylor Swift music. Wonderful, the embodiment of generic pop music. Such taste, Nora. Even as someone who enjoys the Spice Girls and enjoyed musicals like *Xanadu* (1980), *Grease 2* (1982), and *Spice World* (1997)...dear God, get better taste in music. So dreary is Nora's taste in music, I had to listen to the Cocteau Twins, Suzanne Ciani, and the soundtrack to *Waiting to Exhale* (1995) to get through this book. As I type this review, I'm entertaining myself by listening to Madonna's *True Blue* (1986) and *Like a Prayer* (1989) albums because even thinking about this book and Nora's dreadful taste in music is so boring. It should be noted that I am also drinking wine. That's how dreadfully boring this book is. By the time I finish this review, I will probably be drunk.
* *Donnie Darko* (2001) is her least favorite film ever. Why? She never explains herself.
* She could never get into *The Lord of the Rings*, having never read the books and only seeing a few minutes of one film, only to be scared away by some creepy image.
* Who's her favorite artist? I don't know. She only really seems to talk about her grandfather. There are mentions of Frida Kahlo, Vincent van Gogh, Eugene Delacroix, and Pablo Picasso, but they're mainly brought up in a joking manner or a brief reference rather than any sort of meaningful discussion. For an aspiring artist, Nora seems utterly unknowing about any artists, their work, their techniques - nothing. She is a complete dullard when it comes to the topic. For fuck's sake, Dana, would it have killed you to pick up a goddamn art book and peruse through it?
* She's an extremely judgmental bitch, primarily basing her thoughts on people based on how they look or being jealous and petty towards others who are more talented than her (Like Maeve, who is also in attendance for the summer DCYA program).
* Nora also seems oblivious to European countries having their own postal/delivery services.
* Her best friend is Lena.
* Nora and her equally stupid friend, Lena, seem to believe that people in Europe don't wear jeans or sneakers.
* She enjoys referencing things like the Lifetime Channel, *Dr. Who*, and other pop culture references.
* She finds her mother overbearing and annoying.
* She has a habit of doing things even if her brain is telling her not do such things. So quirky.
* She likes to have imaginary conversations and scenarios, like how she imagines her mother, a friend, or a love interest will respond to her. Too bad all her fantasies are so dull.

I hope you're as fucking riveted as I am by this character.

Unfortunately for the reader, Nora is the type of character the author has to **tell us** is so awesome and interesting, rather than **showing us**. This is a fatal error in judgment and an insult to the intelligence of the reader. What we're told versus what we're shown reveals a tremendous discrepancy that no amount of quips or faux quirky self-awareness can undo. This snippet sums up how the character is supposed to be perceived. This comes from Lena before Nora leaves for her trip:

""You're great, honestly. You're going to do amazing stuff. You'll probably be the best artist there by a long shot. And then you're going to meet some hot Scottish boy and fall madly in love and go off and be an art couple like Frida Kahlo and Geraldo Rivera.""

Barring the failed joke of using the wrong name for Frida's husband, this is just the start revealing how utterly unknowing Nora is about art or artists. Bringing up Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera was a big mistake. For one, she's not nearly as talented as either of them (I have to look more into Diego's paintings, but my favorites of Frida's works are ""The Suicide of Dorothy Hale"" and ""The Broken Column"") Second, she's also nowhere near as interesting. And third, yeah, sure you want their kind of marriage. Constant affairs (Thankfully you don't have a sister, Nora. If you married someone like Diego Rivera, he's going to fuck your sister whether you want him to or not. Also, weird standards with a Diego-like lover. You have affairs with women? No problem. You have affairs with other men? He's getting the gun), getting divorced, remarried, numerous arguments, being involved in great political turmoil (Like being kicked out of the Mexican Communist Party and harboring Joseph Stalin's exiled nemesis, Leon Trotsky, who would eventually be assassinated in Mexico after getting brained by an ice axe. Frida also had an affair with him) having your husband's exes hang around (Also, when you both die, one of his mistresses will be made the executor of your estate, including your works of art), and more. They had a very complicated and intensely interesting life together.

Look at that, just that one rant about bringing up Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera already demonstrates how you should be reading about them and studying their works instead of reading *And We're Off*. 

Art is fascinating as are the people who create it. Somehow, Schwartz manages to create an artist who is fascinating neither in their work or their personal life. Even if you're a layman about art (I myself am no expert, but am quite fascinated by it even as a lowly plebeian), you know more about it and appreciate it more than Nora and her creator, Dana Schwartz. And be sure not to miss Nora's mother, Alice, saying that Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Mona Lisa"" is ""overrated."" They never visit the Louvre, this is based on Alice's experiences when she went to Paris in her twenties. Such insight. I truly trust the tastes of these dullard characters.

This annoying, wannabe artist bleeds into additional problems: *And We're Off* makes the world of art and traveling Europe boring as fuck. Now combine these issues with the cliched ""teenager clashing with parent/s about living their own life"" and you've got a mess that's not only boring, but irritating as well.

Let's start with the Eurotrip, which begins in Paris. The first day is uneventful, which is fitting, given they've just landed and a long air trip like that would be tiresome. What about the next day? Nora opens her folder and her grandfather instructs her to visit the Musee d'Orsay. She also wants to visit the Delacroix museum. Can't do the first museum, it's closed today. So, the Delacroix museum it is, but Nora's mother insists on accompanying her. The day consists of eating a nice breakfast, Alice being bitchy to a waitress over the coffee having cream instead of skim milk, buying a purse, looking at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, and not making it in time to the Delacroix museum before closing. Day 3 is the Musee d'Orsay with Nora being required to draw someone while sitting a cafe, as per her grandfather's envelope instructions. Nora and her mother get into an argument later.

Now comes Belgium. Virtually nothing happens and it's dismissed as a ""fake country."" Nora and her mother do crash a military wedding to look an altar piece in a church after they ditch a tour group. Even this detour is boring.

Paris and Ghent are so poorly written about and rushed in this book, it's a wonder why they were included AT ALL. All it felt like was padding that involved eating food, getting lost, arguing, and being insufferable tourists.

Now, onward to Ireland. Okay, so this is the bulk of the Eurotrip described in this book. A colony of young artists in the beauty of Ireland near the sea. New characters to meet and perhaps a peek into the works of the artists as they learn new techniques and hone their craft. Should be an exciting, romanticized aspect of the book to set the reader's imagination loose. **NO.**

Schwartz absolutely refuses to provide any interesting details. At best, yet get fleeting glimpses of the beauty of Ireland and what classes are like at the DCYA. Who are the other people? Mostly just some other people, aside from Callum, who can be described as a friendlier Irish version of Nora's crush, Nick, back in the U.S. They talk some pop culture (Like Callum's love of *The Lord of the Rings* and how *Avengers: Age of Ultron* is his least favorite film ever. Oh, sweet summer child. If only you knew just how terrible the Marvel Cinematic Universe would get) and have some generic meet-cute moments that would not be out of place on the Hallmark Channel (Except with some naughty words the Hallmark Channel would never approve of). Unfortunately, he also still likes other girls, so he's not a one-woman man by the time Nora leaves Ireland.

You would think for the DCYA that there would be more development about how things work and the people that inhabit that space. For example, I adore Joan Lindsay's *Picnic at Hanging Rock* (As well as the superb 1975 film adaptation by Peter Weir. I even have the Gheorghe Zamfir music on vinyl. ""Miranda's Theme"" is spellbinding and wonderful, but I digress). Beyond the central mystery (The disappearance of students, Miranda, Irma, and Marion, and the arithmetic teacher, Miss Crawford, while having a picnic at Hanging Rock on Valentine's Day, 1900), an important aspect is Appleyard College. You get to look into the lives of Headmistress Appleyard, the students, the teachers, and even the various servants of the school. I learned who was popular (Miranda, the ""Boticelli Angel""), who was the smartest (Marion), who came from wealth to add to the school's prestige (Irma), the school dunce (Edith), the orphaned girl who is the target of Mrs. Appleyard's wrath (Sara), and a whole lot more. I even learned about others pulled into the mystery such as visiting Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert, and the coachman for the Fitzhubert family, Albert Crundall. I loved all the moving parts and all the people I got to follow around as I read the story. It was an endlessly fascinating, beguiling, and hypnotic story that still haunts me and lingers in my head. I adore it. It also never directly explains things and there are so many things going on that can be interpreted in a seemingly infinite number of ways. It was also a **shorter** book than *And We're Off*, yet has more going on in its opening than the entirety of *And We're Off*.

I had no reason to care about anyone at the DCYA and all I learned is what the author just spelled out to me through the eyes of Nora. In short, telling me instead of showing me why I should give a shit about this place or any of these people. Bad move. Thou shalt not tell instead of show.

Another missed opportunity is the clash of the Old World versus the New World (Europe versus America) and the culture shocks that come with that. For this, I'm going to stick it to the smug author and her smug book by using an author who she lampooned in her terrible satire book: Henry James. This was a subject he tackled several times. I have yet to read a number of his books, so bear with me for not mentioning some of them (I haven't read *The Portrait of a Lady* yet. I know, I'm missing out. I have it, I just haven't gotten to it yet. I have to finish *The American*, which also has the Old World versus the New World theme. So far, it's marvelous).

One of my earliest exposures to his work was *The Europeans* (My copy is a paperback tie-in for the release of the 1979 film adaptation, which I enjoyed. It is adorned with a picture of Lee Remick who plays Baroness Eugenia Munster in it. The novel is better, though). In it, two European siblings, Eugenia Munster and Felix Young decide to visit their American cousins, the Wentworths, in Boston. Eugenia is a baroness on the verge of divorce from her German husband while Felix lives a bohemian lifestyle of traveling around and painting. Meanwhile, the Wentworths and their extended family are more staunchly conservative and are taken aback by the ways and manners of their European relatives. Felix becomes smitten with Gertrude, Eugenia seems interested in Robert Acton, the local minister, Mr. Brand, is enamored by Gertrude who has no interest in him, Gertrude's sister, Charlotte, is in love with Mr. Brand while pestering Gertrude for her non-conforming ways (Like skipping church and rejecting Mr. Brand), etc. It's a marvelous, classy, funny comedy of manners. Despite its short length, it, too, has a great deal going on as the reader observes the back-and-forth clashes of family, love interests, and differing cultural norms and manners. Everyone learns something from one another by the end.

None of that is present in *And We're Off*. Instead, Nora and Alice are terrible, insufferable tourists who learn absolutely nothing about other cultures or appreciate the sights available to them. Instead, the reader is trapped in a bland journey of self-discovery, thirsting after boring men, an experience of the arts through the eyes of someone with no artistic vision, and more. I hate it.

The parent-child dynamic is also a failure. Nora and Alice can hardly stand one another, spend most of their time arguing, eating food, and then all their issues are neatly resolved at an art gallery in Florence by the end of the novel with a dramatic, sappy reunion (Nora ditched Alice to head to Florence alone after yet ANOTHER argument). You know what that means, Ms. Schwartz? More Henry James just for you.

This time, I'll be using *Washington Square*, which I also adore. In it, we get a cruel, yet clear-eyed view of a dysfunctional parent-child dynamic that is absolutely heart-breaking. Dr. Austin Sloper is a well respected doctor and community member for his philanthropy. He also has a tragic backstory, as he had a son who died at a young age and then became a widower when his wife gave birth to a daughter named Catherine. A son to carry on the bloodline and a seemingly idyllic wife are now dead. Still, he carries on with his practice and raises his daughter and takes in his widowed sister, Lavinia Penniman.

However, Catherine never amounts to anything he wants. She's not talented like her mother nor even as beautiful. There is a quiet contempt for this life circumstance and belittles Catherine to others for being so plain and unremarkable. Never really to her face, aside from an offhand remark, as he seems to view her as a poor invalid who will live out her days as a spinster on the inheritance he intends to bequeath her. Even his poor widowed sister is not immune, as he feels she has ideas that are too romantic and fanciful (Though he's not entirely wrong, as the reader comes to realize, as she meddles in Catherine's life). She, too, is the subject of belittling to others and offhand remarks. But why be upset with him? He's putting a roof over their heads and they're essentially charity cases he can use to prop up his status as a pillar of the community. It's very quietly cruel and shows just how two-faced people can be, especially those who are so quick to say how good they are and talk of the good they do.

Dr. Sloper immediately becomes suspicious when a man named Morris Townsend begins showing interest in Catherine. She's too plain and boring, how could a man possibly have interest in her unless he just wants her money?

It is not a sentimental novel, nor is it melodramatic. It's astonishingly level-headed, calm, and brutally honest. It's a novel that has stuck with me, along with its superb 1949 film adaptation, *The Heiress*. It made a very strong, haunting impression on me.

Okay, so perhaps that's a bit too much for a story that wants to be light-hearted and have all the problems be solved by the end. I don't have a problem with that. For example, I have a great big soft spot for the 1988 romantic comedy/drama, *Mystic Pizza*, which I feel is a very underrated gem. However, despite being lighter in tone, what made it work for me is that it is populated with characters I actually care about and root for their happy endings. I wasn't rooting for any of the characters of *And We're Off*. In fact, I actively wished someone would throw Nora and Alice out of whatever they were being transported in, so the misery would end (Out of the plane, the bus, the car - I don't care. Get rid of them, please).

In the end, I hated the characters, I hated the trip to Europe this novel took me on, I hated the dim-witted exploration of the arts it took me on, I hated the padding (So much eating and arguing), I hated the pop culture references (This will never be a portrait of a time long past with themes that transcend time. It is already decayed and outdated with no compelling themes), I hated the smug attitude that hung over the book like being hot-boxed in a car by multiple people farting at once, I hated the faux quirky aura it tried to project - I hated virtually everything about this book.

1mrptt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1mrptt6/all_i_ever_wanted_is_apology/,All i ever wanted is apology,"It has been 10 months since the breakup with my fearful avoidant ex and 86 days since last contact. Back then, I was studying medicine. I wasnt really a social person, nor did I pay much attention to relationships or love. I think I was in my 5-4th year I don‚Äôt quite remember.

I always used to see her. She was that girl who sat alone, who didn‚Äôt have many friends, and whose relationships were all shallow. She was beautiful and quiet, spending most of her time by herself.

In my fifth year, I decided to talk to her. It wasn‚Äôt easy ,when I first tried, she was arrogant. Still, I eventually got her phone number. We began talking a lot, as we shared many interests. After 3 months, I had passed all the tests of a fearful avoidant, and we entered a relationship that lasted a year. Sadly, it turned out to be the worst year of my life.

I was loving, caring, and very naive, since I had no experience in relationships
she was my first true love. I forgave her lies. I forgave her for disrespecting me. I forgave her fear of love and attachment. She even gave the gifts and flowers I bought for her to her friends. Sometimes she would fight with me for bringing her gifts ,and when I asked why, she said it was because she loved me but was afraid ,if we ever broke up, those gifts would remind her of me as if she already planned the BreakUp. She denied giving away the flowers, even when her friend posted the exact bouquet on her instagram story. I still forgave her.

For 3 months, she lied to me, saying she was on vacation in Turkey visiting her family, when in reality she was just afraid to go on a date with me. When I found out, I forgave her again. Later, she became bedridden for 40 days, and I was the only one caring for her while her family neglected her. She had health problems, and with my medical background, I was confident in my diagnosis. But she would fight me and threaten to leave if I interfered, because she was ashamed of her illness. I forgave her again, knowing it was the illness speaking, not her.

She always turned to her uncle‚Äîa therapist, not even a doctor. She would tell me she dont trust me, that she hated me, and that I should never contradict his opinion(her uncle). His diagnosis was completely wrong and could have cost her life
I stepped in, forcefully, to save her
In the end, I was right, and she recovered.

Then I had to deal with her coffee addiction. She drank excessively, damaging both her health and mind. I endured a month of constant fighting, creating a dietary plan to help her recover. But she always resisted and demanded I stop interfering.

Months later, she discovered that I had lied about something I did a year earlier. At that time, she had already hurt me badly, and I had asked her for space because I was breaking under her immaturity and lack of experience in relationships (or she was just having fun hurting me?) She didnt know how to deal with men, and she broke me many times. One night, I went to a bar and got drunk, devastated by everything she was doing to me. And i came back home and asked me if i got drunk i denied ,8-9 months later she found out and she broke up with me.

For the first 6 or 7 months after the breakup, I tried to reconcile with her. She always said, ‚ÄúI love you deeply, but I cant trust you again.‚Äù I begged her for closure, but she never gave it. Instead, she said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt lie to you because you endured me and taught me so much and i love you‚Äù

The worst part was how she kept avoiding me Whenever she saw me, she would cry. That tore me apart. And after the graduation i cut her off completely 

Now, I see her on social media, living her life, meeting new people, and enjoying herself, as if she never destroyed someone else‚Äôs life.

I‚Äôm sorry for the long message, but it‚Äôs been 10 months, and I am still stuck in the same circle,unable to move. Thanks for listening ",2,1755334995.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

1mrpshn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mrpshn/no_one_talks_about_how_awful_the_first_trimester/,No one talks about how awful the first trimester is,"It's 3:47am and I am awake, feeling absolutely horrible at 7 weeks pregnant. Baby measured 5 weeks 5 days on Wednesday so I guess I'm more like 6 weeks pregnant. Either way I feel fucking horrible!!! I can't sleep, I'm constantly peeing, cramping all the time, tired/fatigued no energy at all. I didn't want to tell anyone until my 2nd trimester but I feel so horrible and anxious that I have had to reach out to several friends who could reassure me that what I'm going through is normal. I can spend all day on Google with it telling me my symptoms are normal but it still isn't enough. 

Especially for nights like these (every night now since I can't take anxiety medicine anymore) when I have no one to talk to. I could wake up my bf but I don't want to bother him. I feel itchy and uncomfortable and either too hot or too cold. I am so sleepy but I can't sleep. All I do is worry even though I try not to. 

My stomach always feels weird now. How is it possible that the first trimester is so bad, and I went 31 years of my life never hearing anything about it?? Other than the morning sickness which definitely is not limited to just mornings. I work from home and still have trouble working. I'm so confused and foggy and forget stuff constantly now. I'll start to type something to someone, forgetting that I literally JUST typed it to them already. 

I'm a supervisor at a company during the busy season and I've been resenting my team for having so many questions without using their resources and resenting coworkers for not doing their jobs, making my job harder and making me less money. I try to be uplifting and encouraging and positive but everyone's doing so many things incorrectly that I can't just let them continue to make the same mistakes. 

I'm the type of manager that really wants to make sure my team understands the HOW and WHY. It would be way easier to do everything myself. It's hard to have to pull them aside individually or as a group and make sure everyone understands how to do everything. I have one new hire in particular that always wants to go back and forth with me bc they don't understand why we do certain things. They question EVERYTHING. Sometimes I just want to be like dude. Fucking let it go. Stop questioning me. Use your team as a resource to ask for help. Or use the reference sheet I've made and meticulously organized to give you all the information you need to be successful. 

I guess I will try to sleep now again even though I'm sure I'll fall asleep right before my bf wakes up and I'm such a light sleeper that he will definitely wake me up as soon as he starts making coffee. ",0,1755334868.0,Vent,3,0.5,False
1mrpsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mrpsey/aio_my_first_love_experience_how_did_i_do/,"AIO? My First Love Experience, How did I do?","Back in October, I started working on a duet for marching band with someone I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúA‚Äù‚Äîa close friend of my ex, ‚ÄúX.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but A had developed feelings for me early on. It wasn‚Äôt until the night of our state championships (November 16th) that he asked me out.

That same night, I had finally begun to feel hopeful about things with X again. After weeks of him flirting with me after competitions and football games, I genuinely thought we were entering a ‚Äútalking stage.‚Äù So when A asked me out, I initially said ‚Äúmaybe,‚Äù unsure of what I wanted. But later that night, I realized my feelings for X were still too strong to give A a fair chance.

I told A I couldn‚Äôt pursue anything, and he immediately understood why. He told me it would never work and that I was making the wrong decision. I was upset and felt like I‚Äôd lost something either way. But over the next week, X continued reaching out to me daily. Eventually, I told him the real reason I had turned A down‚Äîhe only knew I had said no, not why.

X admitted he had feelings for me too, but said it was complicated. He didn‚Äôt want to hurt A. I respected that and decided I wouldn‚Äôt initiate contact anymore, out of respect for their friendship. Still, X kept reaching out every day for the next month and a half. The idea of things ‚Äúnot working out‚Äù came up three separate times, but each time, he‚Äôd reach out again like nothing had changed.

We even tried to make plans to hang out outside of school, but they were eventually canceled. Then, without warning, he stopped reaching out altogether in early January. No explanation. No closure. Just silence.

After X stopped reaching out in early January, I spent the next two months in a really emotional place. It felt like a breakup‚Äîeven though we hadn‚Äôt officially been together. On top of that, I was grieving the loss of my neighbor, who was also my dad‚Äôs best friend. He passed away in late December, and the emotional weight of everything hit me hard.

By the third month, I was frustrated with how X had handled things. I started hearing more about how he had led other girls on‚Äîmaybe unintentionally, but still carelessly. I was finally starting to move on. I felt happy again, living my life like the single girl I‚Äôd always been.

Then, in mid-March, while I was in California for a winter guard competition, X got Instagram and requested to follow me. After a few days, I accepted‚Äîconvincing myself it didn‚Äôt mean anything. A few days later, he shared a post with me about running. I thought maybe we could be friends, since I felt over it. My closest friends disagreed. They‚Äôd seen me grieve him and didn‚Äôt think I should reopen that door.

About a week later, after a friends-and-family showcase, X approached me and asked me to coffee. My honest reaction was: *‚ÄúBruh.‚Äù* I told him he had hurt my feelings and I wasn‚Äôt sure I could go there again, but I left him with a ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù Later, he messaged me apologizing and asked to talk things out over coffee. I agreed‚Äîpartly curious, partly cautious.

It was the end of my winter guard season, and my schedule was chaos. I had a baby shower late Saturday morning, state competition that night, a send-off show the next day, practice Tuesday, and then we left for world champs in Ohio on Wednesday. The only time I had was early Saturday morning or Monday after school, but he had drum major auditions. So I squeezed in a quick meeting Saturday morning.

That‚Äôs when I found out why he had stopped talking to me: his friend (the one I had rejected months earlier) wasn‚Äôt fully over it, and X had finally felt too guilty to continue. He admitted he should‚Äôve warned me but said he genuinely thought we had a good connection and wanted to try again. By then, his friend had started dating someone new, so it was clear he had moved on.

I told X I needed space‚Äîespecially if we were going to rebuild trust. I wanted to focus on guard and finish the season strong. He respected that, and after our final performance, I reached out to him the first chance I got. That marked the beginning of a new ‚Äútalking stage‚Äù in early April.

After our new talking stage began in early April, things started to shift again. We had a mutual English teacher‚Äîdespite being in different grades‚Äîwho had been loosely aware of our situation throughout. While I was away in Ohio for world champs, she saw how much X was beating himself up about everything. Once I returned, she‚Äôd occasionally encourage me to ‚Äúgive the boy a chance,‚Äù reminding me that he was a good kid.

Eventually, we made plans to go on a bike ride‚Äîsomething we‚Äôd wanted to do during our first talking stage but never got around to. The ride went well. There were nerves on both sides, but we made it through. When we got back, he asked me to prom.

To be honest, I already knew it was coming. I spotted flowers in his car when he was unloading his bike, but he didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd seen them. He‚Äôd also been acting a little off while we were finalizing plans. Still, I said yes. All my friends had dates, and I thought, *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre finally making it work.‚Äù*

From there, things picked up quickly. He started sitting at my lunch table more often. We made plans to go tie shopping the Thursday before prom and ended up grabbing Chipotle afterward. The next day was my birthday, and he gave me a walkable dog pillow‚Äîan old inside joke between us. It was sweet and thoughtful.

Prom day came, and I was struggling a bit with confidence. He was supportive, and we held hands for the first time. On the car rides to photo spots and dinner with different groups, we started acting more like a couple. Then, as we were walking into dinner with my friends, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes‚Äîwithout really thinking about how fast everything was moving.

Dinner went well. On the way to prom, he asked if he could tell his friends. Apparently, they‚Äôd made a pact to all get girlfriends by the end of the year, and he was the last one. At prom, they celebrated, and he got a little competitive with one of them about who had the ‚Äúbetter girlfriend.‚Äù It felt weird, but I was still happy, so I tried not to overthink it.

After prom, on the way to get ice cream, things got quiet. Then he said, *‚ÄúHey, I know this might be a little fast, but I just wanted to let you know how I feel. I love you.‚Äù*

I sat in silence, his hand still in mine, unsure what to say or think. He asked if I was okay or if something was on my mind. I replied, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared.‚Äù* I felt like I wasn‚Äôt fully present‚Äîlike I was on the brink of tears from fear, not joy. He said he was scared too, but reassured me that it was okay because everything was still new.

Despite how intense prom night had been‚Äîespecially with X saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù‚ÄîI chose not to act on it further. I didn‚Äôt bring it up again that night, and I carried on like nothing had happened.

The following week, we went to a jazz music event at school together. I mentioned to a friend (L) that X had said ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù but we still hadn‚Äôt kissed, and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to navigate it. She told her boyfriend, who ended up messaging me and encouraging me to make the first move.

We had already planned to go on a double date for ice cream, and during that outing, her boyfriend messaged X to ‚Äúgo for it.‚Äù X tried to play it cool, but he caught on quickly and let him know that I was already aware of what was happening. X admitted he felt weird with them parked nearby, so he drove me home instead.

When we got to my house, I told him I wanted to kiss him‚Äîbut I wanted him to initiate. He said he wanted me to do it, but I didn‚Äôt budge. We ended up sitting in the car for an hour, listening to music while he worked up the courage. Eventually, he did.

The following week, he started bringing up the idea of saying ‚Äúthe L word‚Äù again‚Äîwondering when I‚Äôd say it back. After hearing him mention it a few times, I finally opened up and explained why I hadn‚Äôt yet. I have a complicated history with mental health, and I‚Äôve had painful experiences where opening up to people made them pull away. I wanted him to know that before things got deeper‚Äîjust in case it changed how he saw me.

Shortly after that conversation, I told him I loved him too.

Things felt good. Fast-moving, but good. Still, I noticed that I was often adjusting to his schedule, and he rarely shared much about what was going on with him. It was ironic, considering how often he emphasized the importance of communication.

Toward the end of May, he went on a family trip. One night, we exchanged a few words that hit some emotional nerves, but nothing major. By the next morning, everything felt fine‚Äîit never escalated into a fight.

When he got back, we tried to spend as much time together as possible before I left for a cruise with my mom, aunt, and L.

The Friday before I left for a cruise to Florida, X came over in the morning. Everything felt perfect. That night, I flew out. My phone had spotty service on the ship, so my friend ‚ÄúL‚Äù (who had better connection) helped me stay in touch with our boyfriends. It didn‚Äôt take long to notice that X wasn‚Äôt saying much. I found out‚Äîthrough a group call with L, her boyfriend, and X‚Äîthat his work schedule had changed from one day to three. He hadn‚Äôt told me.

As the week went on, I kept trying to reach out, but his replies stayed brief and distant. Then Friday came, and I heard through L‚Äôs boyfriend that X was attending a band leadership camp from Friday to Sunday‚Äîat a school over an hour away‚Äîand that he was driving a girl there. Again, none of this had been shared with me.

Later that night, after the camp ended, L tried calling X. He immediately hung up. A few minutes later, he called back saying he was driving the girl home and would call when he got back. I waited for two hours. It was 2 a.m. where I was, and out of frustration, I texted him saying I was going to bed and not to bother. I left my phone behind, not knowing he was trying to call until L came to my bed and told me. He hadn‚Äôt called to say goodnight once the entire trip, so I told her I was too tired.

The next night, L and I came up with an idea: we‚Äôd spend the last day of the cruise without contacting our boyfriends. It had been creating drama for both of us. But later, her boyfriend convinced her to change the plan. The next day, I found out X was acting upset, which made me panic. I apologized profusely, and L tried explaining to him, but he kept ignoring me.

On the travel day home, I acknowledged that he was upset and told him I was sorry. He replied that he wasn‚Äôt mad, but would be busy‚Äîwithout explaining further. Later, I saw his location at someone‚Äôs house, then at the movie theater (which he‚Äôd previously said he didn‚Äôt like). Meanwhile, I was updating him about my flights, and he only reacted to my messages. I felt frustrated and hopeless.

The next morning, I texted him saying I was mad and unhappy with how he‚Äôd communicated during the trip. He replied asking to FaceTime. On the call, we argued. I told him I trusted him, but it hurt that he hadn‚Äôt told me things and seemed to talk more to that girl in two car rides than to me in eight days. He said he was just mentoring her. Most of the conversation felt like me expressing concerns and him saying the opposite of what I needed to hear.

Eventually, he asked, *‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù* I told him I‚Äôd had doubts the day before, but I was still willing to fight for us. That‚Äôs when he said he didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship once the school year started. I didn‚Äôt fully process what he meant at first. He said he‚Äôd always love me, wanted to stay friends, and would check in on me in a few days. Then he had to go to work, and the call ended.

That‚Äôs when it hit me.

I started texting him, asking him to reconsider. He agreed to talk, but not that day. The next morning, I asked to meet in person, but he preferred FaceTime since he had work soon. I reluctantly agreed.

That call was mostly me throwing out every possible option, trying to find a way forward. He sat there, saying he‚Äôd made up his mind and was sorry. After about an hour, I got frustrated and accused him of never loving me‚Äîor not loving me as much as I loved him. He went silent. Stopped showing his face. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to be friends and didn‚Äôt want to see his face again. He stayed stone-faced while I broke down. I said goodbye to a wall and hung up before he could respond.

Two days later, he texted me apologizing‚Äîechoing some of the points I‚Äôd made about how hurtful his approach had been. Two days after that, I asked when he wanted his hoodie back. When I saw him, I handed it over and walked away, only giving him the chance to say ‚Äúthanks.‚Äù

He made a decision‚Äîafter thinking about it for over a week‚Äîwithout telling a single soul and without considering my feelings. For a while, I thought I‚Äôd take him back if he tried to make it right. But as time passed, I found myself hoping that day would never come.

Before the breakup, X and I had planned to go to a DCI event together‚Äî*Drums Across the Desert*. It was scheduled for a month after we split, and I was left with three options: go anyway, skip it, or figure something else out. I really wanted to go, but I hoped I could find someone else to go with. For reasons I couldn‚Äôt fully explain at the time, I held onto my ticket. It felt like letting go of it meant letting go of something bigger.

I struggled to find someone who could commit until two days before the event. Two days before that, I had warned X to look for someone else to replace me, since I was actively trying to go with someone else. When I told him I found someone‚Äîmy friend L‚Äîhe responded by saying he wouldn‚Äôt cover the cost of my original ticket anymore and would just bring someone else, since it was too last-minute and he didn‚Äôt have anyone lined up.

I pushed for help, had a full-on breakdown trying to make it work, and eventually found someone to go with. At the event, I saw X a few times. I tried not to look his way, but every time I did, he was already watching me. After the show, we went down to the field to talk to some band members. I assumed he had left, but I was wrong‚Äîhe was suddenly approaching my area quickly. I moved into a conversation to avoid him, leaving L‚Äôs boyfriend behind. Later, L‚Äôs boyfriend said it felt like X came over just to be near me. It was subtle, but unsettling.

The next time I saw him was at a band camp performance where I went to support my friends in guard. X was there as head drum major. I prepared myself mentally and reminded myself I wasn‚Äôt there for him. I looked in his direction, and my two friends sitting next to me started whispering things like: *‚ÄúThat was a long stare.‚Äù* *‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not hiding it very well.‚Äù* *‚ÄúOMG, that was long.‚Äù* *‚ÄúHe‚Äôs staring at you like he‚Äôs longing.‚Äù*

I tried my best to ignore it and stay focused on why I was there.

Then came the final straw. I found out that one night, under pressure, X told his roommates that he had seen my boobs. That felt like a deep betrayal. I had defended him for a long time‚Äîeven after the breakup‚Äîbut that crossed a line. It wasn‚Äôt just immature‚Äîit was invasive. I blocked his number and unfollowed him on Instagram.

That was a month ago.

Now, I‚Äôm planning to attend one last band practice to say goodbye to my guard team before I leave for college. I know X will be there. I plan to give him the cold shoulder‚Äînot out of spite, but to make it clear that there‚Äôs no chance of reconciliation. I don‚Äôt want him to think there‚Äôs still a door open.

1mrpp6q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrpp6q,"Trip report: Upper Middle Rhine Valley & Moselle Valley, May 2025 (Solo, Public Transport)","Hello! I was in Boppard in early May 2025 (solo, fully by public transport) for 5 days, very early in the season and would like to share my trip for those who are planning to go to the Upper Middle Rhine Valley and the Moselle Valley!

**Traveller type/goal for this trip:** relax and chill, admire nice scenery on hikes, old town walks, some castles (I dont have to visit all).

**Base:**¬†Boppard. It was in the middle of the places I wanted to go to, and it was eligible for the free¬†[VRM region](https://www.vrminfo.de/fileadmin/data_vrminfo/PDF/Gaesteticket/Infoflyer/Flyer_GT_englisch_01.pdf)¬†train ticket. I stayed at¬†**Hotel garni G√ºnther**, a balcony room with lovely views of the river. The room was a little dated but has all the essentials and was clean. Many evenings were spent chilling at the riverside and then walking 30 seconds back to the hotel where I chilled even more at the balcony till sunset. Note that you can hear the trains running at the opposite bank even at night, though it was not a big deal for me once I fell asleep.

**Meals**: Most lunches are nameless because I ate at random places that were open (too early in the season!) I ate all my dinners in Boppard. Not a lot of options.

* **Restaurant Keltenschmaus**¬†was a popular steak restaurant, it was great but not spectacular. Had to make reservations (online).
* **Severus Stube**¬†is another popular one serving local food that locals go to! I also made reservations (just walked in to reserve for the next night). Yummy.
* **Osteria In Piazza**¬†\- I ate here twice just because I love Italian food haha.

**Mode of transport between towns:**¬†Mainly train. I took the ferry to Koblenz because the Stolzenfels Castle was closed when I was there so I had some spare time. I used the DB app for train and bus connections.

**Top sites and general thoughts:**¬†I think 3 days to capture the essence would be enough! Suggested days, ranked in order:

* 1 full day in **Bacharach** with hiking. If you are doing a day trip from Frankfurt/Bingen/Rudesheim and can only go to one town, it should be¬†Bacharach!! Very beautiful town, and the views from the hike was spectacular

* 1 day in the Moselle Valley region: **Burg Eltz and Cochem**. Burg Eltz (Moselle Valley): The hike/walk there was wonderful like all the reviews said. The castle and the English tour was really great! Cochem was a nice big old town that still retains its charm

* 1 day for Stolzenfels Castle (though I didnt go!), Koblenz and **Braubach + Marksburg Castle**. Braubach & Marksburg Castle:¬†The town was really quaint, and the English tour at Marksburg Castle was wonderful. It's a smaller castle than Burg Eltz which gave a more ""homely"" vibe :

**Full Itinerary:**

* Day 1 (Sat): Boppard
   * Arrived in¬†**Boppard**¬†from Frankfurt, checked in hotel
   * Hiked to Boppard viewpoint (Vierseenblick) and took the¬†**chairlift**¬†down. The hike was strenous and steep for the first part, and I took lots of break. The view from Vierseenblick was ok, not very spectacular. But it was nice to just chill and watch people paraglide and fly the small planes.
   * Dinner in Boppard.
* Day 2 (Sun): Koblenz + Braubach (can go #3)
   * Original plan in the morning was: bus to Stolzenfels Castle but it was closed for maintenance (usually open on Thursday-Sunday).
   * Took the¬†**KD ferry to Koblenz**¬†instead (dock was right in front of the hotel!). It was a relaxing 2hour-ish (if I recall correctly) ride, very chill. You can order drinks and snacks on board, I didnt know so I already had coffee and pastry from a cafe before boarding, but got an apple strudel on board just to chill.
   * **Koblenz**: Spent the early afternoon there, walked from the dock to the older part. It is easily walkable and not much was open on Sunday. Had lunch at a random place, nothing amazing as it was the few that was open. I didnt visit the fortress but I saw many people at the cable car station area.
   * Took the train to reach¬†**Braubach**. Wandered around the old town, very lovely and quaint, and it seems like I was the only tourist there. Made my way to the Rose Garden. Then, I hiked the Castle trail to¬†**Marksburg Castle**, was too early for the 4pm English tour but they only had English tours at 1 and 4pm so I wanted to make sure I can make it on time! Loved the tour and the homely castle! Trail to Marksburg and back down is well marked.
   * Unfortunately I cannot remember how I got back to Boppard. I might have taken a train up to Koblenz then bus back down to Boppard, as Braubach was on the other side of the river. All covered by the VRM ticket.
   * Dinner in Boppard.
* Day 3 (Mon): Bacharach (must go! #1)
   * Took the train to¬†**Bacharach**¬†(note this is not in the VRM region so you have to purchase a ticket). I am not sure if it was the right way to do but I only purchased the ticket for the Oberwesel (last ""free"" station) to Bacharach and back
   * Wandered around the old town, loved the painter's corner¬†**Malerwinkel**¬†the most! Hiked to Burg Stahleck but note that it is a hotel/hostel now and there is no tour. Had lunch at a random place, nothing amazing as it was the few that was open.
   * Hiking highlight ([see route here](https://www.komoot.com/tour/2237717739)): Hiked up to the¬†**Postenturm Bacharach**, continued through the Vineyards, open fields, then forest. The first part was steep but it was flat afterwards. Loved the view from the top, much more spectacular than the one from Boppard, and then the open fields were just so soothing. I didnt like the forest part as much so should have gone right where there were more fields as compared the the left, but it was still great overall! Komoot was great for planning hikes in Germany and you can see the topography to plan your hike based on your preference. The trails are wellmarked with different signs (chicken, goat, castle etc) for the different trails. I only saw maybe 1 other person walking and 1 person on a bike.
   * Dinner in Boppard.
* Day 4 (Tue): St Goar + Oberwsel (can be skipped if not enough time)
   * Train to¬†**St Goar**, walked to¬†**Rheinfels Castle**. Short hike was lovely. Unfortunately there was restoration going on so half of the place was covered in scaffolding. I can imagine how it looks and feels without the scaffolding, as it is more ""ruins"" type, would be lovely to visit once restoration is complete! They also have a small museum that was fun to read through.
   * Lunch was at this local place¬†**Restaurant ""zur Krone""**¬†\- loved the vibe, ran by an old couple and had schnitzel. It is the only lunch place that I can remember the name because it was the nicest :)
   * Train to¬†**Oberwesel**, did the city wall from one end to another. Then did a hike but gave up after half an hour as it was pretty much forested most of the way (but may open up to lovely views if I had persevered, but I was not in the mood. Ran for the train but missed by 1 minute (it was leaving but from the opposite platform that I had to go down and up the stairs for). So I just sat at the station for 1 hour lol.
   * All train rides covered by the VRM ticket.
   * Dinner at Boppard.
* Day 5 (Wed): Moselle Valley (must go! #2)
   * Took the train to Koblenz, changed train to Hatzenport (both covered by VRM ticket), then bus 365 to Burg Eltz. I dont think I paid for the bus, the driver might have waived it for me or it was covered by VRM ticket...
   * Hiked up to **Burg Eltz**, just follow the signs. I think I didnt even start my Komoot hike because it was well marked, but this was my¬†[saved route](https://www.komoot.com/tour/2242247389).
   * When you buy the tickets, they will inform you where to queue for the English tour. Note that they only take 30 pax per tour as the rooms are small, so just stand in line when you reach! I went in the low season and many of us were sitting around until the guide came and we started to queue to get in, and thankfully I was the last few to be admitted! Lovely English tour.
   * Hiked back down, ran for the bus. You can get the bus timings on the DB app so just check it.
   * Took the train to **Cochem** (still covered by VRM ticket). I just walked around the town, it is the biggest old town I have been to so far, it's lovely to just walk around the alleys and streets, have afternoon tea etc. I hiked up to the viewpoint but didnt go to Reichsburg Cochem Castle as I've had my share of castles. Crossed the Skegerak bridge for nice views of Cochem and the hills.
   * Took train back to Koblenz then Boppard if I recall correctly.
* Day 6: Depart Boppard :)

1mrposo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1mrposo/am_i_wrong_for_ghosting_an_ex_colleague/,am i wrong for ghosting an ex colleague?,"i, 24f want to ask if I was wrong for ghosting a 23m ex colleague after we met up once outside of work.

for context: I only worked there a mth. i was the only new female among mostly male new hires, so coworkers ‚Äúshipped‚Äù us since we were both single. he told me he didn't mind and even asked me at work if I had a crush on him (i didn‚Äôt and told him to not overthink). at work, we only bantered casually, and we only started texting after my last day of work, and only on that night, we chatted for 3+ hrs until 3am. 

right away, he gave me icks. when i mentioned the nxt day, there was a 1 for 1 bbl tea promo and that i was going to queue and deliver it to my bsf home. he immediately asked me to treat him and deliver them to him. keep in mind, we weren‚Äôt even that close.

ltr that same night, he asked me to join him for a mala buffet lunch promo nxt wk during his off day since it required 2 ppl and his friends will be working. i agreed just to see how he was outside of work since he alr felt so different over text than at work.

as time went on, i started to reply slower bc honestly, it was getting exhausting. he would reply immediately even when he was at work, and it felt taxing to keep up with constant back and forth texting. on top of that, most of his messages were him ranting about how tired he was, workplace gossip, or just things that didn‚Äôt feel important to me. it started feeling more like emotional dumping than an actual conversation, and i realized i wasn‚Äôt enjoying texting with him anymore. 

a day before our meetup, he noticed how slowly i'd been replying and also pointed out when i disappeared halfway while chatting with him. he said, ‚Äúu disappeared again. u weren‚Äôt like this on the first day (of texting).‚Äù i explained that it‚Äôs tiring for me to reply immediately all the time. he then brushed it off by saying that was his online catchphrase and i can just ignore it. atp of time, i was getting slightly annoyed with him.

then during the meetup, the red flags piled up:

- kept pushing me 3 times to try his medium spice mala even though I said i couldn‚Äôt eat spicy
- commented on how slow i ate and nitpicked little things
- expected me to plan where to go after and said, ""shouldn‚Äôt girls have things to do?‚Äù
- at popmart, after helping me pull a secret, he said cheesy lines like"" ur happiness is impt"" and ‚Äúif u're happy, i'm happy‚Äù but also pointed out he was glad he didn‚Äôt have to spend his own money for it
- stood too close on the escalator, till the point that his chest is pressing directly onto my back when he's leaning in to look at what i was showing on my phone (i was standing infront of him and he didn't leave a gap)
- asked me to walk him to another station since he dk his way and then saying ""if you want to accompany me, just say""
- got oddly controlling about my phone use. my dad texted me asking what i wanted for dinner, and so i was texting my dad. he then told me to not use my phone. when i explained i was texting my dad about dinner, he complained my dad was biased for asking me what i wanted to eat, projecting his own family issues onto me. fyi, i hardly used my phone the whole day (except briefly on the train while he was using his too)
- bragged about himself repeatedly, calling himself ""gentle, cute, understanding, helpful, quiet, introverted, generous, proper, and decent-looking."" not a joke ‚Äî he repeated it multiple times and this was the 4th time he bought it up. he did it once at work, twice during text (on different days) and agn during our meetup

that night, i paid him back for mala and coffee since he nvr offered to treat and he immediately said ""so can I get your ig now? at least for helping you pull the secret figurine.‚Äù he had alr asked for my ig during the meal and i said no explaining that i only add ppl i'm close with. his reaction was that he would ask agn, and he actually did. that was the last straw and i ghosted him after and turned off read receipts.

there are honestly more icks but i feel like this is getting too long. 

it‚Äôs been 2wks since and he still texts me, asking why i'm not replying or ranting about his work. this morn at 2am, he messaged agn asking why i hadn't come online and saying he had a lot to rant about and that i was the ‚Äúperfect person‚Äù to listen to him. he's also been sending me vids on tiktok after i stopped replying him. honestly, i just find him overbearing and inconsiderate.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a cribbage board should be based on several key features that influence its functionality, durability, and aesthetic appeal.

**Material:** The material used determines the board's longevity and overall feel. Common choices include wood (various types like walnut,maple,and cherry),acrylic,and metal.

The durability of the board is essential, especially if it's frequently transported or used in a high-traffic habitat. Different woods offer varying degrees of resistance to scratches and dents. The aesthetic appeal also varies; some prefer the natural grain of wood, while others appreciate the sleek modern look of acrylic or metal.

**Board Size and Peg Storage:** The size of the board dictates its portability and whether it's suited for travel or home use. Integrated peg storage is a crucial convenience factor.

A larger board provides more room for scoring and a more comfortable playing experience, while a smaller board is ideal for taking cribbage on the go. the presence and design of peg storage are critical; a secure and easily accessible storage solution prevents lost pegs and keeps the board organized.

**Number of Tracks:** Cribbage boards come with different numbers of tracks, typically two or three. The number of tracks determines the number of players who can use the board concurrently.

Two-track boards are suitable for the customary two-player game, while three-track boards allow for three-player games or provide extra tracking for tournament play. consider your typical game configuration when choosing the number of tracks.

**Peg Material and Design:** The pegs themselves are a critical component.They need to be comfortable to handle, easy to insert and remove, and durable enough to withstand repeated use.

Metal pegs often offer superior durability and a more premium feel compared to plastic pegs. The design of the peg head also matters; a larger head provides a better grip, while a more streamlined design can enhance the overall aesthetic.

**Aesthetic Design and Craftsmanship:** Beyond functionality, the aesthetic design of the cribbage board contributes significantly to its appeal.Intricate carvings, unique shapes, and personalized touches can elevate the board from a mere game accessory to a treasured possession.The craftsmanship of the board is evident in the precision of the peg holes, the smoothness of the finish, and the overall attention to detail. Boards crafted by skilled artisans often command a premium price but offer unmatched quality and visual appeal.

Key features of the best cribbage boards include:

* High-quality wood construction
* Integrated peg storage
* Ergonomic peg design
* Smooth and precise peg holes
* Attractive and durable finish

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality cribbage board offers several core benefits that enhance the overall gaming experience.

**Enhanced Gameplay Experience:** A well-designed cribbage board makes scoring easier and more enjoyable. The smooth, precisely drilled holes and comfortable pegs allow for seamless tracking of points, reducing frustration and increasing focus on the game itself.

The clear markings and consistent spacing between holes prevent miscounting, ensuring fair and accurate scoring. The satisfying ""click"" of the pegs as they're moved along the track adds a tactile element that enhances the overall sensory experience.

**Durable and Long-Lasting:** A cribbage board crafted from high-quality materials and with meticulous attention to detail is built to last for generations. This makes it a worthwhile investment that can be enjoyed by families for years to come.

The use of durable hardwoods like walnut or maple ensures resistance to wear and tear, while a protective finish safeguards against scratches and moisture. The robust construction minimizes the risk of damage, ensuring that the board remains in excellent condition even with frequent use.

**Aesthetically Pleasing and Collectible:** A beautifully designed cribbage board can be a work of art in itself, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to any game room or coffee table. Many collectors appreciate cribbage boards for their intricate designs, unique materials, and historical significance.

The aesthetic appeal of a cribbage board can be further enhanced by personalized touches, such as engraved initials or custom artwork. These personalized boards become cherished heirlooms with sentimental value.

**Encourages Social Interaction:** Cribbage is a social game that brings people together.A well-crafted cribbage board can serve as a centerpiece for gatherings, encouraging conversation and friendly competition.

The act of playing cribbage fosters camaraderie and creates lasting memories. The board itself becomes a symbol of shared experiences and a reminder of the bonds between players.

## FAQs Section

**What is the standard size for a cribbage board?**

Unfortunately, I don't really have room for a full size one, so I'm looking into alternatives. The options I've thought of so far are: 

1) Make some kind of jig to cut this with a circular saw. Basically make something to cut this from the opposite side that the table saw is cutting from.

2) Get a hand plane and make this tapered edge by hand. Never used one so I assume there is a bit of a learning curve to get this right. The longest board is 66"" so I'm also thinking it might be quite tedious to actually do this and to get the same angle taper on each board.

3) Change the design and just go for chamfered edges or some other nice looking edge. Could either do this with a hand plane or router.

4) If the rest of these options aren't feasible or easy so just get a folding job site table saw (or rent one for a day). I think this is probably the most expensive way to go.

For 2025, the market is flooded wiht options, ranging from classic styles that honour the historical roots to contemporary interpretations with modern materials and embellishments.

We will delve into the materials, construction, and design details that distinguish the best from the rest, providing valuable insights to help you make an informed decision and step into the world of ultimate comfort and style.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of Venetian slippers hinges on a combination of materials, construction techniques, and design elements. Understanding these features is crucial to selecting a pair that will provide lasting comfort and enduring style.

**Upper Material:** The upper material is arguably the most defining characteristic of a Venetian slipper. Traditional Venetian slippers are crafted from luxurious velvet, known for its soft texture and rich appearance. Though, modern iterations may utilize a variety of other materials, including cotton, linen, silk, and even recycled fabrics. The material's breathability, durability, and overall aesthetic appeal should be considered.

**Sole Material:** The sole is the foundation of any slipper, providing support and traction. Historically, Venetian slippers featured soles made from recycled bicycle tires or other found materials. Today, manufacturers employ a range of options, including rubber, leather, and natural felt. The sole's thickness, flexibility, and grip are important factors to consider, depending on whether the slippers will be worn indoors or outdoors.

**Lining Material:** The interior lining plays a important role in comfort. Common lining materials include cotton, wool, and faux fur. A soft, breathable lining will help to keep your feet warm and dry, preventing sweating and discomfort. The quality of the stitching and the smoothness of the lining are also essential for preventing irritation.

**Construction and Stitching:** The construction and stitching quality directly impact the slipper's durability and longevity. Look for slippers with reinforced seams and a well-defined shape.Hand-stitched details often indicate superior craftsmanship and attention to detail. The way the upper is attached to the sole is another critical aspect of construction; a secure and well-executed attachment will prevent the slipper from falling apart prematurely.

**Design and Embellishments:** While comfort and durability are paramount, the design and embellishments contribute to the slipper's overall aesthetic appeal. Venetian slippers are available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and styles, from classic solid colors to bold prints and intricate embroidery. Consider your personal style and choose a design that reflects your individual taste.

1mrp6x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mrp6x2/hr_entry_86/,[HR] Entry 86,"The garage door groaned open like a corpse dragging itself upright, letting me back into a house that smelled of coffee, detergent, and stale warmth, ordinary, domestic, safe. Mara waved from the kitchen, hair in a messy bun, smiling like sunlight on a tombstone.

‚ÄúHey! How was work?‚Äù she asked, unaware of the shadow curling beneath my ribs.

‚ÄúBusy,‚Äù I said, shrugging off my jacket, though my hands trembled faintly. ‚ÄúLong day, same old.‚Äù

Max peeked around the corner, backpack slung over one shoulder. ‚ÄúDad! Can you help me with my science project?‚Äù

I knelt and ruffled his hair. ‚ÄúSure, buddy. Let‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got.‚Äù

Lily bounced in behind him. ‚ÄúAnd catch with me later, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile that tasted of ash. ‚ÄúBut Max first.‚Äù

I played the part, husband, father, ordinary man. Outwardly normal. Inside, a pulse throbbed, something cold and alive, whispering, waiting, curling tighter with every breath. It had been there my whole life, coiling around thoughts, undetectable and relentless.

Earlier, at a stoplight, I had seen her. Green Chevy Blazer. Dimples, freckles, upturned nose. Green eyes with brown centers. Hello Kitty bumper sticker. That tiny, absurd decal glinted like a signal flare in the dark, screaming remember me.

I slowed, then sped up just enough to follow, careful she wouldn‚Äôt notice. License plate. Driveway. Red brick, white trim, the shrub leaning toward the garage like a sentinel, watching. Every detail seared into my memory with surgical precision, alive, pulsing, demanding.

Later, after the children were tucked in and the house exhaled its quiet sigh, I retreated to the study. My journal lay open, already thick with entries, Entry 86.

Another one. The woman in the green Chevy Blazer. License plate 547 WGN, California. Hello Kitty bumper sticker. Dimples. Freckles. Upturned nose. Green eyes with brown centers. She didn‚Äôt see me follow. I memorized the driveway, red brick, white trim, shrub by garage. I didn‚Äôt stop. Every detail is etched in my mind.

I cataloged the sway of her earrings, the rhythm of her fingers on the wheel, the hum of her tires. A thrill like ice slithered through me, and I knew, I knew, I had crossed a line I had never crossed before.

The journal slid into the back of the top shelf, wedged behind old bills and manuals. Hidden. Safe. And yet, the pulse, the whispering hunger inside me, writhed and pressed against its prison.

Mara hummed, folding laundry.
‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked, glancing up.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, forcing the faintest smile. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

Normal. Ordinary. Safe. But the thing inside me stirred, a parasite coiling, whispering, gnawing at the walls of my mind. It would not be denied.
Days passed. I began noticing patterns, rhythms glimpsed in stolen moments, the green Chevy rolling past a familiar corner, the faint pause before she entered the driveway. I followed, silent, careful, precise.

At home, I laughed, folded laundry, answered questions, cooked dinners. The children spoke. Mara smiled. I nodded along. But the voice inside, my oldest companion, whispered, hissed, tugged, Look closer. Remember. Do more.

I parked down the street, close enough to see her car, far enough to avoid detection. I memorized the tilt of her head, the sway of her hair, the faint rustle of leaves when she stepped onto the walkway. Each observation was a small sting, a pulse of heat in my chest.

I told myself it was harmless. But the truth had teeth. The voice gnawed at restraint, pressing the old hunger to the surface, whispering that it had waited all my life only for this moment. Shadows stretched and leaned in strange ways. The street seemed to pulse with anticipation, as if the world itself had leaned in to watch.

She arrived. The green Chevy Blazer slid into the driveway. My chest tightened, a vice of anticipation. The voice roared, insistent, unforgiving.

I parked a few houses down, eyes glued, heart hammering. Every flicker of movement, every tilt of her head, every sway of her hair burned itself into my vision. The entries, the cataloging, every act of restraint, all of it had led here.

I gripped the wheel until my knuckles whitened. I could feel the darkness coiling, alive and waiting. Every whisper, every hidden journal, every suppressed urge, they were nothing against the pull now. I was poised, balanced on the edge, and I knew I could cross it.

The hum of her tires, the sway of her earrings, the faint glint of sunlight across her hair, it consumed me entirely.

I was ready.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that‚Äôs okay.
Because if you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post.

Maybe it‚Äôs a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn‚Äôt know you needed, until now.

Because I don‚Äôt believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I‚Äôve been missing.

So hey,

I‚Äôm 26. I‚Äôm a doctor. From India.
And no, I won‚Äôt diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I‚Äôm more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I‚Äôm a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The ‚Äúquotes random Marvel lines in conversations‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äústill mad about how Interstellar messed with time‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äúloses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi‚Äù kind.

I fall hard for characters that don‚Äôt exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I‚Äôm the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that‚Äôs equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we‚Äôre not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I‚Äôm learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.
