1k6w802,https://www.reddit.com/r/TowerofGod/comments/1k6w802/fanfic_how_many_family_heads_will_die_in_season_4/,[FanFic] How many Family Heads will die in season 4?,"I played coffee bean solitaire and the stars in the sky formed the answer I needed. My fantasy theory of what awaits us in season 4. So, I believe that in season 4 there will be 2 main battles in which 5 FH will die.

\--¬†

**BATTLE NUMBER 1: (VAAM + FUG army) Team.**

Vaam and the FUG army will go after the third thorn. It will end up on Khun Eduan's main ship.

**FH 1. Khun Eduan will die.** Eduan was V's friend in their memories. And it would be symbolic to start with him. To break all ties, kill the closest friends first. Eduan will be killed by Baam's hands, under V's control.. This will all happen in front of KhunAA and Maria. Which will start the **AA and Maria arc.**

**FH 2. Yirang Yon will die.** For the same reason as Edan. She is a friend of V and Edan. She will probably answer Edan's request for help, but will be defeated there, by V. This will trigger the Revolution arc and **Ihwa's past,** who is a prisoner of the Revolution.

**FH 3. Bloodmedor Hendo Lock will die.** He was afraid of death that he ate the lives of his children, it will be symbolic if he dies among the first. In addition, there is two detail.

(Very dubious theory) His last name Bloodmeder is similar to the last name of Duke Rosemeder, who in TUS created the tower and made an alliance with King Oedipus. And V himself may be the same (Tals User) that Rosemeder wanted to kidnap. In general, they both serve the same god and the same goal. Therefore, when V returns, it seems to me that Bloodmeder will go over to V's side. However, in a big battle, he will be killed by Khun Eduan's spear.

And one more reason. Androsi is probably adopted by Bladmeder. In memory of his dead friend, Vaam decides to kidnap Androsi, who will be there with KhunAA, and make her his wife. Since she looks like Arlene. Androsi will have to choose who she likes, Baam or Vaam (as Garam predicted). Which will lead us to the **arc of Androsi's past.** And her internal struggle.

\--

**BATTLE NUMBER 2: (RACHEL, GUSTANG, WANGNAN) Team.**

Gustang decides to free Anna from the labyrinth, for this he uses Rachel (as an irregular) and WangNan (as a carrier of the blood of Zahard). However, when WangNan and Rachel free Anna, they are attacked by the fleet of Arie Hon and Ari Han in the head of their FH. As well as the armada of princesses led by Adori. Ari Khan will be there because he is paired with Arie Hon (Like Leroro and Quantum). They will be sent there to suppress the Gustang rebellion.

**FH 4. Arie Hon dies.** Suddenly, Hoaquin awakens in Vincent and becomes White again. He, with the help of Heodon, makes a contract with Rachel and becomes her sword, and then inherits part of her powers as an Irregular. As a result, his power-up no longer requires souls and he is no longer tormented by hunger. He challenges his father and in a long battle, with the support of Ann, Zahard kills him. The Arie family arc begins, in which it is revealed that Zahard told Arie Hon about death, and he himself (Hon) prepared a sword for his own death in the form of his son. Because he wanted to die in battle.

**FH 5. Ari Han dies.** At this time, Gustang fights Ari Han. When Han is distracted by Hon's death, Gustang kills him. Han does not have an arc, but he does have a flashback episode during Ha Yurin's memories (in the 5 season). 

All this is seen by Hon's daughter, Adori. She is very angry about her father's death and the failure of her mission. **This starts the princess war arc.** On one side, Adori and the princesses who are loyal to Zahard. On the other side, Ann Zahard. But suddenly Garam joins in with his army from the death floor. Then Masheni joins in, who wants to start a major war. And also Ha Yuri, who Repelista promised that if she helps the girl with freckles, she will tell Yuri how to get Baam back. Adori's army is defeated and retreats.

\--

**RESULT:** 

**BY THE END OF SEASON 4, 5 FAMILY HEADS WILL HAVE DIED.**

1. Edan Khun

2. Yon Yoran

3. Hendo Lok Bladmeder

4. Arie Hon

5. Ari Han.

**BY THE END OF SEASON 4, 3 GROUPS WILL BE FORMED:**

1. Three Family Heads (Eurasia, TuPeriTperi, Ha Yurin) and the surviving princesses led by Adori will remain on **Zahard's side**.

2. The Revolution forces, the renegade princesses, Gustang, Sour and Sweet will gather around **Rachel**.

3. The FUG slayers and elders who have been sleeping for a long time and also ancient powers will gather around **Vaam**.

Epilogue of Season 4. WangNan becomes the new leader of the Revolution cell (As Boss or Captain). The Revolution Cell's (led by Rachel and WangNan) will declare a declaration of their campaign against FUG. In addition, KhunAA will also join Rachel and WangNan, as he will decide that he can use this situation to save Baam and Androsi  from V and FUG. This will end Season 4.

**Main question: Please tell me how much my fanfic does not correspond to reality. And who from FH do you think will die in season 4.**

1k6w3lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1k6w3lk/my_insomnia_protocol/,My insomnia protocol,"Posting in case someone can benefit from this. 

Historically, I have gone through periods of insomnia where I can't sleep on some nights at all, some nights 3 hours ON a benzo, and some nights like 11 hours straight. It's maddening. Just recently had an episode, and wanted to share what I think the issue is. My normal sleep habits are barely staying awake past 9 or 10 (even with a coffee at 3pm), so when I hit an episode, I really feel like I'm losing it. I have four kids to take care of and I can't sleep during the day.

I think it's basically MCAS, or an accumulation of histamine from exposure to a virus that triggers my episodes. These immune cells start overproducing histamine. The first step is to lower your histamine as this competes with other necessary hormones like serotonin, melatonin, and GABA, which are needed for sleep and feeling generally well. In case you care about theory.

I've had a 48 hour turn around using the antihistamine protocol, combining an H1 and H2 blocker. For the H1 blocker, I personally chose an older generation antihistamine called chlorpheniramine maleate because it worked better for me than the newer ones like Allegra, Zyrtec, etc, but you can try those. I chose famotidine for the H2 blocker. It's super cheap (they both are) and easy to take. 

AM:

3 Chlorpheniramine tablets (4mg each so total **12 mg**)  
4 Famotidine tablets (20 mg each so **80 mg total**)  
Repeat that Famotidine dose in the evening anytime - **80 mg total again for a daily total of 160 mg)**   
It sounds like a lot of Famotidine, but there are studies on using this method to counteract long COVID (essentially an MCAS issues) using up to **360 mg daily** for two weeks. It's one of the safest and most studied OTC meds. I would do this for two weeks before cutting out the evening dose of famotidine, and maybe continue the morning doses for 1-2 months to make sure the mast cells stabilize. The reason I take them in the morning is because it takes time to build your serotonin levels back during the day and most histamine is produced from eating anyways - I feel mildly tired but it goes away quickly. I'm also one of those people that when I'm in an episode could take 100 mg of Benadryl at night and still not sleep - your body doesn't have time to work down the histamine in that short time. 

It helps to use something to boost your serotonin levels as well. I've had success with an antidepressant before, but needs to be combined with the antihistamine routine or it won't help. This time around I've chosen to take Quercetin 1000 mg and Astaxanthin 12 mg with a meal. You could try those alone, but I think it would take a few weeks to see results and I personally want to start sleeping ASAP. 

Hoping you can achieve some sleep. ",2,1745510955.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1k6w38o,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1k6w38o/i_came_out_to_my_family_it_went_as_well_as_i/,"I came out to my family. It went as ""well"" as i thought it would.","This is going to be a big text dump, i just need other perspectives from people who also deal with these things..i have no trans friends and i feel very alone a lot of the time when it comes to these problems.

Well i finally did it back in August after years of dealing with gender dysphoria and going through the lovely process of meeting with different doctors and trying to find the help i need, i started taking hormones. It has been completely life changing for me in a lot of ways and before i started i wasn't sure if it would help me much at all. It changed how food tastes, i smile so much more at little things, I'm giddy about a nice sunrise or sunset, I'm excited when i wake up most days and want to do a lot more than i used to, i have a routine in the mornings to make myself feel pretty. All of that really comes down to loving myself. I still have all of the same thoughts of envying beautiful women, dissecting every single flaw of mine in the mirror, telling myself no a lot of the time when it comes to the things i eat. And dealing with these feelings of I'll never really pass or be the woman i wish i was born as. But I'm still just a baby trans just starting this whole journey, yes much like everyone else in the community i delt with my problems in the closet for years, christ since i was 16 I'm almost 30 now. But i couldn't of ever imagined how much hormones would help me love myself. 

I'm so much happier then i used to be and i just wanted to start sharing that and not have to hide it anymore. I had been openly gay and crossdressing for a few years before but in September a month after i started i went all in for my birthday. I didn't want my friends to know me as Andrew anymore..they had to meet Annie. I had told two close friends a few weeks before and they helped make a little ""coming out"" party for me. It was amazing!! now that were all getting a bit older it's hard for my old friend group of guys to get together. But everyone showed up, a group of 20 of us and not one of them rejected me. They all made sure that i knew no matter how i want to identify or what name i want to be called, they're all still going to love me and be there for me. Okay so that went better then i expected! time to start socially transitioning in the other big parts of my life, work and family. Well work has been garbage and that's a story for another day. 


A bit of a time jump but not much happened between September and now. i was happy i didn't have to hide my personality or how i wanted to present myself to my friends, but from then until now i was trying to figure out how i would tell my family. You see the reason my friend group was so accepting of me is because since i was very young ive always relied on them for a lot. They are my family in a lot of ways because were closer then my actual mom step dad and brother.

The biggest problem is my mother, she describes herself as a traditional feminist and is a VERY politically driven person. EVERY single time I've been over since November she has had 6 different news networks open and is on her computer browsing through Twitter or Facebook or something. And she is OBSESSED with conspiracy theories. So naturally she could see the road i was going down and fucking despised it. When i would come over with my nails done or makeup even after a day of work she would have some questions. And she would always remind me ""your a gay man and thats okay""  because she dose not accept ""transgenerism"" So that's been a pretty hard pill for me to swallow because well my mom is really the only family i have left, my dad is gone, i lost all of my grandparents in the last few years, shes married and my step dad is pretty awesome but i know he will make endless jokes now about me being trans, but those are mostly harmless and he doesn't have any extreme perspectives, i still need to have lunch with him to actually get his proper reaction...

But on Sunday i said enough was enough, I don't want to hide it from them anymore. I want them to know I'm on hormones and how much happier it's made me, how much different i want my future to look now. And i was just tired of her telling me what i am, she doesn't understand and frankly never will. I also need to tell them because even though I'm still a baby through all of this I desperately want to change my legal name and gender identification, she holds my birth certificate.

So i got myself ready, some light makeup an absolutely adorable Shirt, skirt and knee high combo, spent the morning with my boyfriend drinking coffee and going for a nice nature walk to calm my nerves. I went over at around 1 and my mom was in her usual spot on her computer with fox news playing. I climbed the stairs and showed her my outfit, she didn't say much to that but then i started talking. ""mom I'm transgender, i know you don't accept that but i need you to know."" Oh My God, her reaction..""I don't know what internet rabbit hole you've crawled down to make you think your a girl."" she started going off about how i must think she's stupid because I've been trying to hide it ""oh i knew when you started wearing makeup that this is what you would do, i just thought you would snap out of it before you started destroying your body with hormones!"" ""and to what end! what do you think ridding the estrogen dragon is going to do for you?!?!"" So i told her to what end, how long I've had these feelings of wishing i was a woman but knowing I'm stuck as a man, and how wrong my brain made me feel for having those feelings at all. All I want is to be called Annie and be more passable, i know I'll never really get everything I want..even with surgeries there's just some things I wont be able to change about myself..She ends up just trying to put me down by saying trans people just want to take away rights and jobs from cis women. Saying how for the past few years I've been narcissistic towards her and how she has never given me a reason to think she would stop loving me. Overall she said a lot of bad things to me and by the end i was just kind of in tears and didn't know what to say to her absolutely ridiculous responses..She reluctantly said that she would try to accept this side of me but she doesn't want me to legally change my name and is really dragging her feet when it comes to my birth certificate, she hasn't once called me Annie instead of Andrew and she is still telling me I'm her son. 


So I'm at a bit of a loss..i told some of my friends her reaction and none of them were really surprised. One friend told me that she's just projecting a lot of her own problems onto me and that reassured me that I'm not a self centered piece of shit. He said specifically ""narcissistic behavior is like 8 times worse then anything you've ever displayed"" that made me feel a lot better because he actually knows her pretty well and is like the smartest person I know. 


So i don't know what my real question is with this text dump, I've just got a lot on my mind about it, they do still love me but don't really accept me. But through this whole journey i have learned that loving myself is more important than anything else and i do love myself more and more everyday, nothing she says to me about how i can't change biology or how this is all some trend that I'll regret is going to change that. I just wish she would accept me and encourage me to be myself instead of tearing me down for finally doing something for me. Is there really anything i can do to possibly change her perspective? Or should I just deal with the fact that theres always going to be a fight about this?",1,1745510932.0,trans,1,1.0,False

1k6vzkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k6vzkq/why_buy_mr_coffee_espresso_machine_review_is_it/,Why buy Mr. Coffee espresso machine review is it worth your money?,"Testing out the Mr. Coffee 2132815 Espresso and Cappuccino Machine became part of my daily routine, as I found myself exploring its features in-depth. Designed for coffee enthusiasts like me who can't step out of the house without their espresso fix, this appliance offers more than just a caffeine boost‚Äîit brings a slice of caf√© life to your kitchen counter. Its sleek black design combined with stainless steel components blends seamlessly into a modern kitchen aesthetic. As someone who drinks coffee religiously, I couldn't wait to see if it lived up to the hype. Spoiler alert: it did, mostly.

**Design That Fits Into Your Kitchen and Lifestyle**

This machine is smaller than I anticipated, but that‚Äôs actually a positive for anyone dealing with limited counter space. It‚Äôs compact yet doesn‚Äôt compromise on utility, which is a rarity. The rounded design lends a softness to its overall look, making it less of a gadget-ey eyesore among kitchen equipment. With dimensions of 9.84""D x 10.63""W x 12.4""H, I found it easy to tuck into a corner without it feeling intrusive. The reusable filter, made for sustainable brewing, was another design choice I appreciated. However, I noticed the stainless steel finish tends to require regular wiping to keep its pristine shine.

**Ease of Use**

For beginners or coffee shop regulars looking to embark on a DIY caf√© adventure at home, the controls on this machine are straightforward. Operating it is as simple as pressing a few buttons. The measuring scoop included in the package makes portioning coffee effortless, while the water pitcher has measurement markings that were incredibly handy for someone like me who can't eyeball quantities to save my life. The fully automatic operation means you can walk away mid-cycle without worrying about over-extraction. That said, mastering the steam wand and frother definitely took me a few tries. Beginner espresso makers should expect a bit of a learning curve for achieving perfect froth or milk textures.

**[Ready to snag Mr. Coffee 2132815? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08nfmkhsk/)**

**Upsides**

- Milk frother: The frothing wand exceeded my expectations. It delivered creamy cappuccinos after a few practice runs.
- Compact size: Perfect for smaller kitchens.
- Value for coffee lovers: This single machine covers espresso shots, lattes, and cappuccinos, satisfying multiple preferences.
- Easy cleaning: Parts like the frothing pitcher and reusable filter were easy to wash.

**Performance That Brews Caf√©-Quality Beverages**

One standout feature is the steam brewing process that creates a rich, dark espresso, perfect for caf√©-style Cuban coffee. As someone who takes their coffee seriously, brewing 4-shot portions in one go felt luxurious‚Äîespecially on mornings where one cup is never enough. I did notice some variability in how the pressure performed during subsequent runs. If you‚Äôre making back-to-back drinks, allow the machine to settle for a few minutes to maintain consistency. On mornings that felt rushed, this tiny wait could be frustrating but didn't diminish the actual coffee experience.

**Areas of Concern**

- Learning curve: Despite its ‚Äúsimple‚Äù tag, dialing in espresso strength and frothing consistency required practice.
- Steam pressure variability: Not always reliable across multiple uses.
- Durability concerns: Some reviews noted issues with long-term performance, like plastic handles breaking after months of use.

**Competing Products**

You could compare this to similarly priced beginner espresso makers like the De'Longhi EC155 or Nespresso Essenza Mini. While the De'Longhi offers slightly better durability, its frother is not as robust, often leaving foam too weak for lattes. The Nespresso product excels in convenience due to its capsule-based system but lacks customization options, which might discourage coffee purists. Mr. Coffee edges out the Nespresso for those who prefer crafting drinks manually‚Äîa hands-on experience is part of its charm.

**Smart Spending**

The affordability of this coffee machine is why I finally gave this so-called ""budget-friendly espresso maker"" a try. Other espresso setups can easily cost five times as much, so getting decent shots of espresso and rich, creamy froth at this price point is notable. Though I wouldn‚Äôt call it luxury equipment, its plethora of features makes it feel much more expensive than it is. Add the fact it saves you from spending $7 on a daily latte, and you‚Äôll make up the cost in no time.

1k6vzhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k6vzhf/explore_the_functionality_of_mr_coffee_cafe/,Explore the functionality of Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista in this in-depth review!,"The **Mr. Coffee EM5000 Espresso and Cappuccino Machine** has been my trusted companion for several weeks now. As someone who‚Äôs spent a small fortune on coffeehouse beverages over the years, investing in this machine felt like a logical step. It promises coffeehouse-quality drinks in the comfort of your home‚Äìa pretty compelling idea for any coffee enthusiast. While there‚Äôs plenty to love about this programmable machine, I‚Äôve also discovered a few quirks worth mentioning. Here‚Äôs how the experience has unfolded so far.

**Stylish Design and Compact Form**

The silver, stainless steel finish brings a sleek, modern aesthetic to my kitchen counter. Its size surprised me in the best way ‚Äì a small but mighty machine that doesn‚Äôt dominate valuable kitchen space. Measuring just 8.86"" in depth and 11.22"" in width, it tucks neatly near my toaster without feeling cramped. The matte exterior finish also makes it easy to wipe clean, which is a bonus when you‚Äôre dealing with coffee grounds and milk residue.

**Highlights**

- Compact size suitable for small kitchens.
- Sleek and modern stainless steel design.
- Easy-to-clean exterior with a professional vibe.

**One-Touch Functionality: Convenience at a Button**

The one-touch control panel is simple and inviting. As someone who‚Äôs more comfortable with tech that doesn‚Äôt require flipping through manuals for hours, this machine gets points for user-friendliness. Making espresso or cappuccino involves tapping the respective button, and boom, it‚Äôs brewing. I‚Äôve used the customizable shot options quite a bit, alternating between single and double shots depending on how much caffeine I need to face the day.

The automatic milk frother? Life-changing. No guesswork or manual frothing required‚Äîjust consistent, fluffy foam every time. Lactose-free or almond milk doesn‚Äôt froth as well as whole milk, but that‚Äôs par for the course with most similar systems. 

[Time to see **Mr. Coffee EM5000** cost on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b007k9oimu/)

**Performance: Reliable, but Some Glitches**

This 15-bar pump system exceeds expectations when it comes to robust, flavorful espresso. The aroma is akin to something you‚Äôd get at a coffeehouse, which is impressive given the machine's simplicity. However, I ran into some hiccups early on. The espresso temperature wasn‚Äôt quite hot enough during my first few uses, falling short of the optimal extraction zone. After a quick troubleshooting session involving a cleaning cycle with white vinegar (thanks to online forums), the heat improved dramatically.

Timing is another critical aspect with this machine. Shots initially pulled through a bit too quickly, around 15 seconds. After experimenting with grind size and tamping pressure, I‚Äôve since managed to stretch the extraction time closer to the golden 28-30 seconds. But honestly, making such adjustments felt more like an adventure than a bother.

**Pluses**

- 15-bar pressure brew system ensures rich flavor extraction.
- Automatic milk frother simplifies the process.
- Consistently great-tasting coffee once settings are customized.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Initial brewing temperature may require tweaking.
- Shorter shot time without fine-tuning grind and tamp pressure.
- Frother struggles slightly with non-dairy milks.

**Durability Concerns: Mixed Longevity Feedback**

Although my machine still looks and works as if it‚Äôs fresh out of the box, other customers reported durability issues over extended use. The milk frother, in particular, seems prone to decline after a year of daily operation. Proactive cleaning and descaling appear to delay these problems somewhat, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm keeping an eye on.

**Competing Options**

A friend of mine swears by the Breville Bambino Plus, which admittedly brews faster, partly thanks to its ThermoJet heating system. However, that model is pricier and lacks an integrated milk frother, meaning more manual work with the steam wand. Another alternative I tested briefly was the De'Longhi Dedica EC685, which delivers similar performance but feels slightly less intuitive to use. The Mr. Coffee machine stands out in its price bracket for offering premium features like automation at a more accessible cost.

**Quality for Price**

For what it costs, this semi-automatic espresso machine brings remarkable features to the game: a 15-bar pump system, intuitive controls, and an integrated frother. While it‚Äôs not cheap per se, it proves to be a financially-savvy choice considering how much you‚Äôd save by skipping daily coffeehouse runs. Sure, there are high-end competitors, but you‚Äôll spend significantly more for only marginal quality improvements‚Äîunless you‚Äôre a coffee connoisseur.

1k6vzby,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k6vzby/explore_the_jura_ena_8_automatic_espresso_machine/,Explore the Jura ENA 8 Automatic Espresso Machine Review Is It Worth It,"The Jura ENA 8 Automatic Espresso Machine (item model number ENA 8) has been a game-changer during my mornings, and it‚Äôs been a joy to test its features daily. Coming in Full Metropolitan Black with a compact design, this sleek machine has not only elevated my coffee-making routine but also my kitchen's overall aesthetic. I‚Äôve tested a few automatic espresso machines over the years, but this one sits at the junction of elegance, functionality, and innovation. That being said, there are aspects worth noting for anyone considering bringing this premium appliance home.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design of this espresso machine is a standout feature. Measuring just 20.7 x 16.7 x 18.2 inches and weighing around 30 pounds, it‚Äôs ideal for smaller kitchens or apartments where counter space is premium. The diamond-patterned cylindrical water tank is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing‚Äîhonestly, it looks more like a designer piece than a home appliance. I‚Äôve had a few guests comment on the sleekness of its modern style, and it fits seamlessly with my other black appliances. However, I did find the fingerprint marks on the black exterior slightly annoying, especially after multiple uses.

**Advanced Brewing Technology**  
This machine takes coffee brewing to the next level with its 3D brewing technology and Pulse Extraction Process (PEP). The PEP optimizes extraction time and ensures that every cup of espresso is bursting with flavor. I tested this with a variety of beans, from light roasts to dark Italian blends, and the aroma was always perfectly preserved, thanks to the Professional Aroma Grinder. The consistency of the extraction is unmatched‚ÄîI could genuinely taste the improvement in the richness and depth of the coffee.

**Get the Jura ENA 8 here:** [**Check Jura ENA 8 price on Amazon.**](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dgb8m4pv/)

**Ease of Use and Connectivity**  
With its intuitive touchscreen display and app-controlled features (Wi-Fi Connect compatible), preparing coffee has never been simpler. The Jura ENA 8 offers 15 drink options, ranging from lattes to espressos to cappuccinos. My personal favorite on sluggish afternoons is the flat white with creamy milk foam. Using the JOE app was initially a bit of a learning curve, but once I got the hang of it, brewing my favorite coffee became a hands-free experience. I even set it up to brew right from bed! However, connecting to the app felt a bit more tedious than expected, especially when I had to reset it due to a Wi-Fi issue.

**Milk Foam Perfection**  
Milk-based drinks are where machines often falter, but the Jura ENA 8 absolutely shines here. Featuring Fine Foam Technology, it creates light and creamy milk foam that‚Äôs perfect for lattes and cappuccinos. The complimentary Jura Glass Milk Container bundled with this set made frothing even more efficient. My kids loved the hot chocolate I made using steamed milk, and I found the Fine Foam Technology performed consistently well across several drinks. That said, cleaning the milk frothing system requires attention, as residual milk can quickly build up.

**Good Points**

* Exceptional coffee quality with 15 customizable drink options
* Compact design with an eye-catching water tank
* Professional Aroma Grinder ensures flavor-packed brews
* Fine Foam Technology delivers creamy and consistent milk-based drinks

**Areas of Concern**

* The black exterior shows smudges and fingerprints easily
* The JOE app setup can be fiddly with certain Wi-Fi networks
* Cleaning the milk frothing system can feel a bit time-consuming

**Competing Products**  
When compared to competitors like the De‚ÄôLonghi Dinamica and Breville Barista Touch, the Jura ENA 8 holds its ground in terms of flavor and design. The Dinamica has an edge in offering iced coffee options, while the Barista Touch provides more manual customization for coffee enthusiasts. However, neither competitor matches the Jura ENA 8‚Äôs refined design, PEP technology, or its ability to produce barista-level foam with such consistency. For those seeking luxury and ease, this machine feels like the more premium choice.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For a machine offering this many features‚Äîincluding Intelligent Water System (IWS) technology, CLEARYL Smart Plus filtration, and 3-Phase Cleaning Tablets included in the bundle‚Äîthe price seems justified. Coffee aficionados who frequent cafes will definitely notice long-term savings. It‚Äôs an investment, but the exceptional flavor and convenience bring excellent value. If premium coffee is your love language, this compact dynamo feels worth every penny.

It's marketed as a stainless steel French press coffee maker, but it feels like much more to me. From its sleek design to its thoughtful features, this little contraption gets coffee-making right, though not without a few quirks. If you're as particular about your coffee as I am, you‚Äôll want to keep reading.

**Design That Catches the Eye and the Hands**  
This stainless steel French press exudes elegance with its polished silver finish and durable borosilicate glass. It's not too bulky, fitting seamlessly on my countertop without demanding too much space. The handle feels solid but remains lightweight enough to maneuver comfortably. I‚Äôve tested other glass coffee makers before, and they often feel fragile. But with this model‚Äôs stainless steel reinforcements, I don‚Äôt find myself holding my breath every time I wash it or set it down. It could survive even my clumsiest mornings!  

One quick note: the sleek design does attract fingerprints. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but if you're someone who likes things looking spotless, you might end up wiping it down after every use.  

**A Flavor Adventure Through Filtration**  
I've used plenty of French presses, and what stood out for me with this one is the 4-level filtration system. This mechanism ensures even the finest coffee grounds don‚Äôt sneak their way into your perfect cup. After brewing, my coffee tasted smooth and free of sediment‚Äîno annoying grittiness at the bottom. As someone who prefers medium-ground coffee for its balanced flavor, I was impressed that this French press tackled it with finesse.  

It also doubles as a tea press, and I've used it for my loose-leaf teas. While I'm primarily a coffee enthusiast, my coworker, who‚Äôs a tea junkie, tried it and called it a ""game-changer for tea's full flavor extraction."" It‚Äôs nice that it offers versatility for homes that dabble in both beverages.

[Don‚Äôt miss Cafe Du Chateau Espresso Maker deals‚Äîcheck Amazon here.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b01j4o0t4e/)  

**Some Pros You'll Appreciate**  
- The BPA-free materials give me peace of mind, especially since I‚Äôm shifting toward healthier household items.  
- Unlike some cheaper brands I've tried, it adheres strictly to US FDA and European standards.  
- Here‚Äôs a pleasant surprise: the handle stays cool despite hot liquid inside. Forget burning your hands while pouring!  

**Boons for Those Seeking Durability**  
Durability is a star player here. I‚Äôve accidentally knocked it against my sink several times, yet the borosilicate glass and sturdy construction refused to crack. The stainless steel elements also add a premium feel, making it less susceptible to dents or scratches. This resilience is incredibly reassuring on chaotic mornings when time is short, and clumsiness peaks. And did I mention the lifetime replacement warranty? Even if fate decides to test your luck with this coffee maker, you're covered.

**Pitfalls to Be Aware Of**  
- Cleaning this coffee maker isn‚Äôt tough, though disassembling the filter requires a bit more effort than I anticipated.  
- Despite the robust design, the insulating quality could be better. If you‚Äôre someone who loves sipping your coffee slowly over an hour, you might notice it cools down quicker than some insulated carafe designs.  
- The metal components can add a faint metallic note to your coffee for the first few brews, though it fades after several uses.  

**Comparing It to Peer Products**  
There‚Äôs no shortage of French presses out there, so the real question is: how does this one stack up? Compared to models like the **Bodum Chambord** or the **SterlingPro**, this press holds its ground. Bodum models often match this device in aesthetic appeal, but they sometimes fall short in filtration quality, occasionally leaving grit behind. The SterlingPro offers dual-layered insulation for those who prioritize sustained warmth but lacks the lifetime warranty the Cafe Du Chateau provides. If safety, durability, and hassle-free filtration are must-haves, I think this one carves out a solid niche for itself.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Let‚Äôs talk about whether this coffee maker justifies the cost. While exact prices fluctuate, the product‚Äôs robust build, elegant design, and standout warranty justify its place in any budget-friendly coffee setup. I‚Äôve seen alternatives at a lower price, but they usually skimp on materials or don‚Äôt offer the same level of filtration quality. This French press lands squarely in that sweet spot between affordability and premium features. Honestly, knowing I have a lifetime replacement eases any buyer‚Äôs remorse I could have considered.

I‚Äôm planning a road trip through Greece starting from North Macedonia and making my way down to Athens by the end of May. I‚Äôll be traveling solo in my car and sleeping in it most nights ‚Äî a mix of car camping / stealth camping. I‚Äôve got a mattress in the back, a bike with me, a tent, and I‚Äôm on a tight budget, so I‚Äôm hoping to avoid paid accommodation as much as possible.

I‚Äôm wondering if sleeping in the car is likely to cause issues with locals or the police. I really don‚Äôt want to disrespect anyone or accidentally park somewhere that upsets people, like private property or beaches where this isn‚Äôt welcome. I know Greece gets a lot of camper vans, but I‚Äôm trying to stay spontaneous ‚Äî just stop when I‚Äôm tired and wake up somewhere peaceful.

I‚Äôm also trying to figure out:
	‚Ä¢	Where it‚Äôs safe and chill to park overnight (beaches? nature spots? rest areas?)
	‚Ä¢	Any hidden gem regions or towns to explore between the border and Athens
	‚Ä¢	How strict the laws really are around this kind of camping
	‚Ä¢	Any shower or bathroom solutions (I‚Äôve got a small power station for food prep, but hygiene is still a puzzle)
	‚Ä¢	Bonus: If anyone else is traveling this way and wants to link up for a coffee or chill beach day, let me know!

Any tips on routes, beaches, or affordable campsites to break things up would be awesome. I‚Äôm into nature, good food, and just making the most of this little adventure.

Thanks so much in advance!

# üö® The Problem: Constant Fatigue, Brain Fog, and Zero Motivation

Let me paint a picture of what my days used to look like. I‚Äôm a parent, I run a small business, and I‚Äôm well into my 40s. I tried to eat right. I made sure I got my steps in. Still, every morning felt like I‚Äôd barely slept. I‚Äôd stare at my computer, re-reading the same sentences. My to-do list grew longer because my brain just wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúswitch on.‚Äù Even after a full night‚Äôs rest, I felt like I was constantly running on empty.

By lunchtime, I wanted nothing more than to crawl back into bed. My patience was thin, my motivation hit rock bottom, and I started wondering if this was just ‚Äúgetting old.‚Äù I missed feeling sharp and energized, like I could take on anything. I wanted to feel alive again, not just ‚Äúokay.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I started searching for real solutions and stumbled across MITOLYN.

# üîç What Is MITOLYN and Why Did I Choose It?

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd find in the energy drink aisle. It‚Äôs not a quick fix or a sugar rush. What drew me in was how different it sounded from anything else. MITOLYN is a science-based supplement built specifically to support the part of your cells that creates energy: the mitochondria.

Here‚Äôs why it stood out to me:

- It doesn‚Äôt rely on caffeine or sugar‚Äîno jitters, no crashes.
- It contains ingredients I‚Äôd seen in real scientific studies about aging, memory, and energy.
- It‚Äôs designed to help your body create more energy on its own, not just mask tiredness.
- It supports focus and endurance, not just physical energy.
- It aims to help your cells stay healthy and work better as you get older.

I spent hours reading about mitochondria and how important they are for feeling good. MITOLYN seemed like it was made for people who want their bodies and brains to work better from the inside out. That‚Äôs when I decided to go for it and see what would happen if I gave it a real try.

# üìÖ My Experience: What Happened in the First 30 Days

I started MITOLYN with realistic expectations. I knew it wasn‚Äôt magic, and I was ready to give it an honest shot.

**Week 1:** I didn‚Äôt get a sudden burst of energy. But within a few days, I realized I wasn‚Äôt yawning as much. My brain fog started to fade. I could follow conversations without zoning out. I noticed I was finishing little tasks more quickly.

**Week 2:** Something shifted. I woke up one morning and felt‚Ä¶ normal. Not groggy, not dragging. I didn‚Äôt need to chug coffee just to start my day. My afternoons felt lighter, and my mind was clearer. I started reading again for fun because I could finally focus.

**Week 3:** I found myself wanting to move more. I took longer walks and even started stretching before bed. My motivation was coming back! I didn‚Äôt have afternoon energy crashes, and my sleep felt deeper and more restful.

**Week 4 and Beyond:** By the end of the month, I felt like the best version of myself. I was more patient with my kids. I got ahead on work projects. My mood was stable, and I actually looked forward to each day. I could feel my body working better, from my mind to my muscles.

# üí• What Makes MITOLYN So Powerful?

The secret to MITOLYN‚Äôs power is in its ingredients, and how they work together to support your mitochondria‚Äîthe tiny engines inside every cell. Here‚Äôs what makes it stand out from other supplements I‚Äôve tried:

# 1. CoQ10 (Ubiquinone)

CoQ10 is found in every cell and is crucial for turning food into usable energy. I learned that as we age, our bodies make less of it, which can lead to tiredness and slower thinking. MITOLYN gives you a big enough dose to help recharge your cells and keep them running smoothly.

# 2. PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)

This ingredient was new to me. PQQ helps your body make *more* mitochondria‚Äînot just help the ones you already have. It‚Äôs like adding new power plants to your body. More mitochondria means more energy and better brain function.

# 3. Acetyl L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps move fat into your mitochondria, where it‚Äôs turned into energy. It also supports memory, focus, and even learning. I noticed my brain felt ‚Äúswitched on‚Äù in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

# 4. Alpha Lipoic Acid

This powerful antioxidant helps protect your cells from damage. It also helps your body use sugar for fuel and keeps your nerves healthy. I read that it can even help your skin look brighter by fighting cell aging.

# 5. Rhodiola Rosea

This plant helps your body handle stress and reduces mental fatigue. I found I could deal with busy days and unexpected problems without feeling overwhelmed or burned out.

MITOLYN combines all these ingredients in the right amounts so they work together, not against each other. That‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt just give you a short-term boost‚Äîit supports your well-being in the long run.

# üåü Unexpected Benefits: What I Didn‚Äôt Expect But Got Anyway

When I started MITOLYN, I just wanted more energy. But I found some surprising benefits, too:

- **Sharper thinking:** I can remember names, appointments, and ideas without writing everything down.
- **Better mood:** I feel more positive and less irritable, even on tough days.
- **Easier weight management:** With more energy, I move more and snack less.
- **Stronger immunity:** I haven‚Äôt been knocked out by colds like I used to.
- **Healthier skin:** People have commented that I look ‚Äúwell-rested‚Äù and even asked about my skincare routine (I haven‚Äôt changed a thing).

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Who Should Use MITOLYN?

If you‚Ä¶

- Feel tired all the time, no matter how much you rest
- Struggle with mental ‚Äúfog‚Äù or forgetfulness
- Find it hard to stay motivated or focused
- Want to age with more strength, energy, and clarity
- Are tired of ‚Äúquick fixes‚Äù that don‚Äôt actually work

‚Ä¶then MITOLYN could be exactly what you need. I wish I‚Äôd found it sooner!

# ‚úÖ Final Verdict: Buy It. Take It. FEEL the Difference.

If you‚Äôve been searching for a real solution to low energy, MITOLYN is worth trying. This isn‚Äôt hype or just a placebo‚Äîit‚Äôs a supplement backed by real science and real results. After a year, I can honestly say I feel younger, stronger, and more myself than I have in a long time.

I tell everyone I care about to try it, because I know how amazing it feels to finally have your spark back. If you‚Äôre tired of just ‚Äúgetting through‚Äù the day, give MITOLYN a chance. Take it consistently, and see what happens.

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Before I ever heard of MITOLYN, I was stuck in what felt like a never-ending cycle of tiredness. I‚Äôm in my early forties, balancing work, kids, and all the daily chores. No matter how much I slept, I always woke up feeling groggy. By the afternoon, I‚Äôd hit a wall‚Äîmy brain felt foggy and my body just wanted to give up. I tried all kinds of things: energy drinks, fancy multivitamins, green smoothies, and even going to bed earlier. Nothing really made a big difference.

I was also frustrated with my weight. Even when I ate healthy and exercised, it felt like my body just didn‚Äôt respond. I was always looking for some magic fix, but nothing ever lasted.

One night, I saw a bunch of real-sounding stories online about MITOLYN. People were talking about how it helped them feel young again, like their bodies and brains finally woke up. I was skeptical, but also desperate for something that could truly help.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

So what exactly is MITOLYN? In simple words, it‚Äôs a supplement designed to help your cells make more energy. Our bodies have tiny parts inside each cell called mitochondria. Think of them like little batteries‚Äîwhen they work well, you feel energetic and alive. When they‚Äôre tired, you feel tired, too!

MITOLYN is made to ‚Äúcharge up‚Äù those little batteries. It‚Äôs not just a quick fix like coffee or sugar. It‚Äôs a blend of natural ingredients that help your cells create energy in a healthy way. Some of these ingredients I recognized‚Äîlike CoQ10 and ginseng‚Äîbut others were new, like PQQ and NAD+ boosters.

What makes MITOLYN special is that it‚Äôs focused on fixing the real problem (sluggish mitochondria), not just hiding the symptoms.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

## Week 1
I started slowly, just to see how my body would react. After a few days, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself out of bed as much. I actually woke up before my alarm and felt ready to start the day. That was a first in years!

## Week 2
By the second week, I wasn‚Äôt desperate for my usual afternoon nap. My mind felt clearer, and I was getting more done at work. Even my family noticed I seemed happier and less cranky.

## Week 4
A month in, my sleep got way better. I didn‚Äôt wake up in the middle of the night as much, and in the morning, I felt truly rested. I had enough energy to exercise and still enjoy the rest of my day. My mood was steady, and I felt less stressed even on busy days.

## Months 2-6
This is when things really kicked in. I started losing some stubborn weight, even though I wasn‚Äôt eating perfectly. My skin looked healthier, and my friends started asking what I was doing differently. I was getting more done, with less effort. I even noticed I didn‚Äôt get sick as often.

## Months 7-12
By the end of the year, I felt like a new person. My doctor checked my health numbers, and even those had improved. I felt sharp, focused, and full of energy every day. I wasn‚Äôt just surviving‚ÄîI was actually enjoying life again.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

MITOLYN helps your body in a simple but powerful way: it helps your cells make better, cleaner energy. When your cells work better, everything else gets easier‚Äîthinking, moving, even sleeping.

Here‚Äôs how some of the key ingredients helped me:
- **CoQ10**: This is like fuel for your body‚Äôs batteries. It helped me feel more energetic and kept my heart healthy.
- **PQQ**: This one helps your body make more mitochondria. More batteries = more energy!
- **NAD+ Boosters**: These help keep your cells young and fix any damage. I felt like I was slowing down the aging process.
- **Ginseng and Rhodiola**: These are natural herbs that help you handle stress and keep your mind sharp, but without the jitters I‚Äôd get from coffee.

What really worked for me was how these ingredients worked together. MITOLYN is more than just a vitamin‚Äîit felt like a total upgrade for my whole body.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

Based on my year-long experience, here‚Äôs who I think should give MITOLYN a try:
- If you‚Äôre always tired, no matter how much you rest
- If you have trouble focusing or remembering things
- If you feel like your body is aging faster than it should
- If you want to lose weight but nothing seems to work
- If you just want to feel like yourself again‚Äîenergetic, happy, and strong

I‚Äôve already told my family and friends about MITOLYN, and even the biggest skeptics have noticed real changes!

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

**Pros:**
- I felt a difference in just a few days
- It‚Äôs all-natural and free from weird chemicals
- No side effects for me (and I‚Äôm pretty sensitive)
- My mood, energy, and focus all improved
- The company is open about their ingredients

**Cons:**
- It costs more than some regular vitamins, but I think it‚Äôs worth it
- You have to order it online (though delivery was quick)
- You need to remember to take it every day for the best results

I'm a guy in my late 20s and met someone (let‚Äôs call him¬†C) at my university library. We hit it off quickly ‚Äî hung out a lot, talked about deep stuff, and he made me feel like I had a safe space. I trusted him enough to share things I don‚Äôt tell many people: my rough upbringing, being bullied, past struggles with depression and suicidal ideation. He listened, invited me to his church, introduced me to his social circle, and I thought I'd found a solid friend.

But as time passed, I noticed things getting... off. He and his brother started pushing political conversations, defending Trump, and subtly trying to pull me in their direction. I told them politics made me uncomfortable and tried to draw a boundary. At one point, C asked if I held my views just because of my dad (who's a Democrat). I told him that was a weird question and didn‚Äôt want to continue the convo.

Later, I confronted him over text about how dismissive and smug he‚Äôd been. I asked for an apology ‚Äî nothing dramatic, just an acknowledgment. He said he wouldn‚Äôt do it over text and insisted we meet. I agreed, even bought him a coffee. But instead of any kind of apology, he went off on me. Said I had low self-worth, accused me of projecting my issues onto him, and even said something like ‚Äúthe devil‚Äôs speaking through you.‚Äù He tried to force a prayer on me, pushed for a hug (I declined), and just made me feel emotionally bulldozed. That was it for me ‚Äî I walked away from the friendship.

I stopped attending the church group altogether. Since then, some folks from there have been texting, asking where I‚Äôve been. I‚Äôve just told them school and work are keeping me busy ‚Äî trying to avoid the drama. C‚Äôs brother even unfriended me on LinkedIn, and C acts like nothing ever happened when he sees me ‚Äî gives me fist bumps and greets me like we‚Äôre cool. I go along with it just to keep things from escalating, but honestly, it feels fake and manipulative.

Lately, I‚Äôve been anxious he‚Äôs talking behind my back ‚Äî maybe even sharing some of the personal stuff I told him, trying to spin it to make me seem unstable. I haven‚Äôt replied to him or anyone in that circle since January. One of his friends still texts occasionally with stuff like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs catch up soon,‚Äù but I just keep saying I‚Äôm tied up.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for walking away without offering the group an explanation? Part of me feels like I‚Äôm finally prioritizing my mental well-being, but another part worries I‚Äôve let him take control of the story.",3,1745510218.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

# MITOLYN Review: The Supplement That Gave Me My Life Back

I‚Äôm not the kind of person who writes reviews for everything I try, but this time, I just couldn‚Äôt keep quiet. MITOLYN gave me back the spark I thought I‚Äôd lost for good. If you feel like you‚Äôre dragging through each day, barely making it to bedtime, or just not feeling like yourself, I know exactly how that feels. I want to tell you what happened when I tried MITOLYN, so maybe, just maybe, you can feel better too.

# üß† The Life I Was Living Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN, every day felt like a struggle. I‚Äôd wake up feeling more exhausted than when I went to bed. No matter how many hours I slept, I still felt tired‚Äîlike my battery wouldn‚Äôt recharge. Simple things, like remembering where I put my keys or following a conversation, became hard. My patience was thin, and little things would set me off. My body ached, my mind was cloudy, and it felt like I was aging faster than everyone around me.

I tried everything to feel better‚Äîmore sleep, less caffeine, different diets, and even those ‚Äúenergy‚Äù drinks that just made me jittery. Nothing worked for long. My doctor said I was ‚Äúfine,‚Äù but deep down, I knew something was off. That‚Äôs when I started looking into how our cells make energy. I learned about mitochondria‚Äîthe power plants inside every cell. When they slow down, everything else does too.

# ‚ö° What is MITOLYN and Why Is It So Powerful?

MITOLYN is a special supplement made to help your mitochondria work better. Think of mitochondria as tiny engines inside your cells. When they‚Äôre healthy, you have plenty of energy, you think clearly, and your body can fix itself. When they‚Äôre not, you feel tired, forgetful, and old.

What makes MITOLYN different? It‚Äôs packed with ingredients that actually help your cells make more energy and protect them from getting damaged. Here are some of the star ingredients:

- **CoQ10 (Ubiquinol):** This helps your cells make energy and keeps your heart strong.
- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** This one helps your body make *more* mitochondria.
- **Acetyl L-Carnitine:** This helps move healthy fats into the mitochondria so they can burn it for fuel.
- **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** A powerful antioxidant that protects your cells from harm and keeps other antioxidants working.
- **Resveratrol:** Helps your cells stay healthy and fights the stuff that makes you age faster.

MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt just give you a quick boost and then let you crash. It helps your whole body run better from the inside out.

# üî• My First Month on MITOLYN: A Total Transformation

When I first started taking MITOLYN, I didn‚Äôt expect miracles. I took two capsules each morning with water, just like the bottle said. For the first few days, not much changed. But by the end of the first week, I woke up feeling something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time‚Äîrested.

By the second week, my head felt clearer. I could focus on my work, remember things better, and even had energy left at the end of the day. The 3 PM slump? Gone. I didn‚Äôt need coffee to keep going, and I stopped craving sugar just to get through my afternoons.

After a month, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúgetting by‚Äù anymore. I was excited to wake up and start my day. My skin looked brighter, my mood was better, and those little aches I used to have were fading away. Even my family noticed I was more cheerful and present. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just give me energy‚Äîit gave me a whole new outlook on life.

# üí™ Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

I‚Äôve tried other supplements before, but none of them worked like MITOLYN. Here‚Äôs why I think this one is different:

**It Heals, Not Just Hides Problems**  
Most ‚Äúenergy‚Äù pills make you feel awake with caffeine or sugar, but then you crash later. MITOLYN actually helps your cells make more real energy, so you feel good all day.

**It Grows New Mitochondria**  
Thanks to ingredients like PQQ, MITOLYN helps your body make new mitochondria, so every cell in your body can work better. It‚Äôs like getting a brand new engine for your car!

**It Protects Your Cells**  
Aging and feeling tired often come from damage inside your cells. MITOLYN brings powerful antioxidants right to where they‚Äôre needed, stopping that damage before it starts.

**It‚Äôs Backed by Science**  
MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a random mix of vitamins. Every ingredient was chosen because of real research showing it can help your cells, your brain, and your body last longer and feel stronger.

# üß¨ Who Needs MITOLYN? (Spoiler: Probably You)

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just for people who are sick or old. If you:

- Wake up tired, even after a full night‚Äôs rest
- Need coffee or sugar just to make it through the day
- Struggle to remember things or focus at work or school
- Feel like you‚Äôre aging faster than you should
- Notice your workouts aren‚Äôt as strong as they used to be
- Or just want to protect your body and brain as you get older

Then MITOLYN could help you. Even if you‚Äôre healthy now, it‚Äôs a great way to keep your cells strong and your mind sharp for years to come.

# üåü My Final Verdict: MITOLYN is a No-Brainer

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, if you want to feel young and strong again, or if you just want to protect your body as you get older, I can‚Äôt recommend MITOLYN enough. It‚Äôs not just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs real science and real results. I‚Äôm living proof that you don‚Äôt have to accept feeling old or worn out.

Don‚Äôt wait another day to start feeling better. MITOLYN gave me my life back‚Äîand I think it could do the same for you.

# Before MITOLYN: A Life Half-Lived

Not long ago, my days all blended together in a fog. I‚Äôm in my 40s, but I felt decades older. Mornings were a battle‚Äîmy joints ached, my brain felt slow, and I just wanted to crawl back under the covers. Even after a long night‚Äôs sleep, I was still worn out. I‚Äôd forget what I was doing, lose track of conversations, and feel overwhelmed by the tiniest things.

It hurt, not just physically but emotionally, too. I stopped going out with friends. I barely had the energy to keep up with my family. I even stopped doing things I loved, like hiking and cooking. It felt like I was running on empty, and nothing could fill me up.

Doctors told me everything was ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù But it didn‚Äôt feel normal. That‚Äôs when I started reading about how our cells make energy, and I stumbled on MITOLYN.

# What Is MITOLYN and Why Is It So Powerful?

MITOLYN is a next-level supplement focused on something most people never think about: mitochondria. These are the tiny engines inside every cell, making energy so our bodies and brains can work their best. As we get older, or when we‚Äôre stressed, sick, or eating badly, mitochondria can get sluggish or damaged. That means less energy for you‚Äîmentally and physically.

What makes MITOLYN stand out is that it helps your mitochondria bounce back. It doesn‚Äôt just give you a quick boost like coffee or energy drinks. Instead, it works deep inside your cells to fix the source of tiredness.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find inside MITOLYN:

- **CoQ10 and PQQ:** These are like superfoods for your mitochondria, helping them multiply and work harder.
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine:** This helps transport fuel into those tiny engines, so your body can make more energy and your mind stays sharp.
- **Resveratrol & Alpha-Lipoic Acid:** Powerful protectors that keep your cells safe from damage and help with healing.
- **NAD+ Precursors:** Top scientists call this the ‚Äúkey to anti-aging.‚Äù It helps your cells repair and renew themselves.

The real magic is how these ingredients work together. Lots of supplements toss in random stuff, but MITOLYN is designed so every part helps give your cells a second chance.

# Week 1: The Fog Begins to Lift

The first few days with MITOLYN were honestly surprising. I didn‚Äôt expect miracles, but by the fourth day, I noticed something: mornings weren‚Äôt quite so hard. I got out of bed a little faster. I didn‚Äôt need my usual massive mug of coffee just to feel human. My thinking felt a bit clearer, like someone had opened a window in a stuffy room.

On day five, I caught myself smiling in the shower. It wasn‚Äôt a sudden rush of energy, but more like a gentle reboot, as if my body was slowly waking up from a long nap.

# Week 2: Energy Like I Haven't Felt in Years

By the second week, the changes got even better. My energy was steady all day‚Äîno crashing mid-afternoon, no feeling wiped out after a walk or a trip to the grocery store. I started moving more, doing stretches and even some light exercise, and I didn‚Äôt feel exhausted after.

At work, I noticed I could focus for longer. I remembered details I used to forget. I even finished books I‚Äôd abandoned because I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. My family noticed I was laughing more. My friends asked what I was doing differently. I felt like I‚Äôd been switched back on.

# Week 3: A New Me Emerges

By week three, MITOLYN was working its magic in ways I didn‚Äôt expect.

- **Sleep:** I was falling asleep faster and waking up energized. I could actually remember my dreams!
- **Mood:** I felt lighter, less grumpy, and way more optimistic. The little things that used to annoy me just rolled off my back.
- **Appearance:** My skin looked brighter, and even my eyes looked clearer and less tired.
- **Pain:** My joint pain faded to almost nothing. I could move without thinking, ‚ÄúOuch.‚Äù

I realized MITOLYN wasn‚Äôt just giving me energy‚Äîit was helping my whole body heal and recover. It felt like someone had pressed a ‚Äúreset‚Äù button inside me.

# The Real Secret? Cellular Healing.

Most people try to fix tiredness, aches, or foggy thinking by treating the symptoms‚Äîmore coffee, painkillers, or just pushing through. But the real problem is that your cells aren‚Äôt making enough energy. That‚Äôs the root cause.

MITOLYN goes straight to the source, helping your cells repair and recharge. It tells your body, ‚ÄúYou can feel young and healthy again. Let‚Äôs do this!‚Äù

Once you fix this at the cellular level, everything else gets better‚Äîyour mind, your body, even your mood.

# Is MITOLYN Worth It? 1000x YES.

I totally get it if you‚Äôre skeptical. I was, too. I‚Äôd wasted money on fancy powders and ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù pills that did nothing. But MITOLYN is different. It‚Äôs backed by real science‚Äîand it works.

It‚Äôs not just about being able to get through the day. MITOLYN gave me back my spark. I wake up looking forward to things. I can play with my kids, go for walks, and stay up to finish projects. My brain feels sharp, and my body feels strong.

If you feel even a little bit like I did‚Äîtired, foggy, or just not yourself‚Äîyou owe it to yourself to try MITOLYN.

# The Secret to a Healthier, Happier You

If you‚Äôre like me, you want to wake up every day feeling energized, focused, and just plain good about yourself. That‚Äôs what drew me to MITOLYN in the first place. This isn‚Äôt just another pill you swallow and forget about‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to help your body and mind work together, so you can feel healthier and happier in every way.

What I love about MITOLYN is that it doesn‚Äôt just claim to fix one problem and call it a day. Instead, it takes a big-picture approach to well-being. Whether I‚Äôm dealing with stress from work, feeling sluggish in the afternoon, or just wanting a better night‚Äôs sleep, MITOLYN promises help in all those areas. It‚Äôs like a little boost for your whole body, inside and out.

# Powerful Ingredients for Maximum Results

When I looked at what‚Äôs inside MITOLYN, I was pretty impressed. The ingredients aren‚Äôt just there for show‚Äîeach one has a real job to do, and together, they make a powerful team. Here‚Äôs what I found out about some of the main ingredients:

- **Ginseng Extract:** If you ever feel tired before the day is even halfway done, you‚Äôll like this one. Ginseng is famous for boosting energy and helping your brain stay sharp. It‚Äôs like a natural way to wake up without needing more coffee.

- **Turmeric:** I always heard that turmeric is good for you, but I never knew why. Turns out, it helps calm your body down and keeps your joints feeling good. Plus, it protects your cells from bad stuff in the environment.

- **Vitamin D3:** I know I don‚Äôt get enough sunlight, and that‚Äôs where Vitamin D3 comes in. It helps your immune system fight off germs and can even lift your mood when you‚Äôre feeling down.

- **Ashwagandha:** This is a weird-sounding word, but it‚Äôs actually a plant that helps you deal with stress. Whenever I have a tough day, I want something that keeps me calm and steady, and ashwagandha helps with that.

MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt stop there. It combines these with other natural helpers to give your body what it needs to feel strong, balanced, and ready for anything.

# Why MITOLYN is a Game-Changer for Your Health

So, what does all this mean for your everyday life? For me, the big difference with MITOLYN is that it makes me feel good in several ways at once. Here‚Äôs how:

- **More Energy and Focus:** I used to hit a wall in the middle of the day. With MITOLYN, I feel like I can keep going, whether I‚Äôm working, running errands, or helping my kids with homework. I don‚Äôt get those jittery feelings that coffee gives me, either.

- **Better Sleep:** I always thought I just had to deal with tossing and turning at night, but MITOLYN actually helps me relax before bed. I wake up feeling rested instead of groggy.

- **Stronger Immune System:** With so much sickness going around, I‚Äôm grateful for anything that helps keep me healthy. Vitamin D3 in MITOLYN makes a real difference for my immune system.

- **Calmer Mind:** Life can be stressful, but MITOLYN helps me manage it better. I‚Äôm less likely to snap at my family or worry about little things, and I can think more clearly, even on busy days.

What I really appreciate is that MITOLYN takes care of my body and my mind at the same time. It‚Äôs a true ‚Äúwhole health‚Äù helper.

# MITOLYN's Growing Popularity in the USA and UK

It‚Äôs not just me who‚Äôs noticed the benefits of MITOLYN‚Äîtons of people in the USA and the UK are jumping on board. I see reviews all over social media where people talk about having more energy at work, feeling happier at home, and even seeing improvements they didn‚Äôt expect, like better skin or less soreness after exercise.

I think the reason MITOLYN is so popular is that it fits with what more people want these days: real, natural solutions that help us feel our best, without weird side effects or a bunch of chemicals we can‚Äôt pronounce. As more people try it and share their stories, it‚Äôs only getting more attention.

>As you have come to suspect, it is indeed possible to develop caffeine sensitivity. Due to certain changes that take place in our bodies as we grow older, this becomes more common as we age. Research shows that older adults clear caffeine from the body more slowly than younger people. In one study, coffee drinkers between the ages of 65 and 70 took 33% longer to metabolize caffeine than did younger participants. A slower clearance rate means the same amount of coffee that someone has been habitually drinking would have an amplified effect. This can cause unpleasant symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, jumpiness, difficulty with sleep, sleeplessness and the ‚Äúracy‚Äù feeling that you describe in your letter.

I've been finding that I'm getting some brain fog in the morning, about 2 hrs after waking. Talked to my doctor about it and one of the suggestions, after we cleared all the obvious things that it could be, was to reduce my caffeine intake because of the diuretic effect of caffeine (I do drink water with electrolytes in the morning, but it wasn't offsetting well enough). Turns out that it worked. So I'm down to the equivalent of 1 cup of full caff coffee. Which kind of sucks because the flavor isn't as good with decaf. 

Just so it's perfectly clear, I'm not interested in your suggestions for how to fix the issue that I've run into, because I'm already talking to a doctor about it and I don't like to take medical advice from Dr Reddit.

So here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at financially:

I‚Äôm currently a stay-at-home mom and not working at the moment. We have some credit card debt and are trying to get serious about budgeting, paying off debt, and saving for a house.

**Debt:**
- I have $3,000 in credit card debt spread across three cards  
- My partner has $500 in credit card debt  
- I also have $8,000 in student loans  
- We‚Äôre still paying off a car seat ‚Äî $75/month with $323.25 left  

**Income:**
- My partner is the only one working right now and makes $36‚Äì$39/hour depending on the job site.  
- I graduate college this week and will be starting work around June, making somewhere between $50K‚Äì$60K/year.

**Our current monthly bills look like this:**
- Rent (May 1st): $1,000  
- Water (19th): $124.40  
- Electric (20th): $203.23  
- Car Insurance (15th): $192.16  
- Phone Bill (15th): $65  
- Wi-Fi (21st): $55  
- Disney+ (1st): $20  
- Apple Music (10th): $6  
- Spotify (21st): $12  
- Xbox Live (26th): $10  
- Credit Card Payments:  
  - Firelands (15th): $40  
  - Discover (18th): $100 (Balance: $1,700)  
  - Capital One (17th): $40 (Balance: $100)  
- Car seat loan (17th): $75 (Balance: $323.25)

**Savings:**
- $800 in cash savings  
- $2,000 in savings bonds  

**Our goals:**
- Pay off credit card debt  
- Start saving aggressively for a house  
- Buy a small starter home after my partner hits his 2-year mark at work this November  

**Other upcoming expenses:**
- We‚Äôll be hiring a nanny when I start working since I‚Äôll be working from home. She charges $80/day or $40 for a half day and brings her daughter with her. Depending on how much my mom helps, we expect to pay around $300‚Äì$400/week for childcare.

**Here‚Äôs what I need advice on:**
- How do we structure our money once I start working?  
- Should we pay off all the credit cards first before saving for a house, or split our money between debt and savings?  
- Should we try to live off one income and save the other?  

I‚Äôve never been taught anything about finances, and I‚Äôve definitely been overspending (daily coffee runs, unnecessary purchases). I cut all of that out last week and I‚Äôm really ready to make a change. We want to stop living paycheck to paycheck and build toward something real.

Any advice or budgeting strategies are appreciated!

If you like your coffee strong and hot, and prefer something more classic than drip machines, coffee percolators are a solid choice. They're great for people who want a richer brew and don‚Äôt mind the old-school way of making coffee. They're also handy for camping or big gatherings.

We reviewed these as part of our work at **Requiremints**, where we review products to help people find what fits their needs best (features, budget etc..)

Before buying a coffee percolator, consider:

* **Electric or stovetop**? Electric is easier for daily use, stovetop is great for camping or power-free setups.
* **Capacity** ‚Äì How many cups do you need? Some are perfect for 1-2 people, others can brew for a crowd.
* **Material** ‚Äì Stainless steel lasts longer, and some come with glass knobs to check brew progress.
* **Ease of cleaning** ‚Äì Dishwasher safe is a bonus.
* **Portability** ‚Äì Important if you're taking it outdoors.

* **(Best for Large Groups)** **SYBO SR-CP-100B** \- Commercial-grade build, perfect for offices or events. Brews 100 cups and has a heavy-duty spigot for easy serving.

# Stovetop Coffee Percolators

1k6vbes,https://i.redd.it/f85o3dqpoqwe1.png,Alternate timeline: What if Iris helped the visionaries survive to present day?,"Credit to u/NerdScore for the idea for this scenario - [original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalDestination/comments/1k5zj7x/imagine_sam_alex_kimberly_wendy_and_nick_met_iris/)

After years of cheating Death, Iris soon realizes that there will be more disasters and more visionaries who will go through the same experience as her, so she takes it upon herself to serve as their guide and teach them her master-class on how to survive as long as she has.

When Iris learns about the North Bay Bridge collapse, she tracks down Sam with the help of Bludworth and gives him the rundown on Death's Design as well as give him her best tips on survival. Together, they manage to prevent the deaths of Olivia and Dennis.

It's thanks to Iris' teachings that Sam and Molly leave Flight 180 before takeoff, recognizing something is wrong when Alex freaks out. When they learn that Alex had a premonition, they introduce him to Iris the day after the explosion, explaining the coming ordeal and how to stop it. Iris helps save Terry and Billy's lives.

Alex avoids getting bonked by a brick, and admits himself to the asylum along with Clear. When Kimberly seeks their help after the Route 23 pileup, Alex gives her Iris' contact. The two of them eventually leave the asylum to help, and the full group succeeds in saving Nora, Kat and Rory. Clear is sadly still killed. Kimberly survives the movie as normal (if the wood chipper is canon, she avoids it).

Kimberly eventually catches wind of the crash of Devil's Flight, and tips off Iris about Wendy. She approaches Wendy at the funeral of Ashley and Ashlyn, and when Wendy shows her the photos, she realizes their foreshadowing power. Lewis, Erin and Ian's lives are saved with Iris' help. Wendy refrains from boarding Subway 081.

Wendy directs Iris to the McKinley Speedway disaster, where she informs Nick of the coming events. With her help, Nick saves the lives of Andy, Jonathan, and George. Iris also suspects the vision of the theatre disaster is false, and thus prevents Nick from going to the coffee shop where the truck will hit.

At last, all of the visionaries have survived to the present, using everything they were taught from Iris to continuously cheat Death for years just like she had. They all keep close contact with each other in order to optimize survival. But then, Iris soon realizes that Death has had enough of her meddling and is about to start hunting her family. Knowing her time will soon be up, she gathers the visionaries and lets them know about Death's new plan. She makes sure they will all help to continue her legacy and keep her family safe after she dies.",15,1745509105.0,FinalDestination,2,1.0,False
1k6vaon,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1k6vaon/idk_what_to_do_need_advice/,Idk what to do! Need advice!,"
Hi guys,

I‚Äôm a junior finance major and, to get to the point, the internship search has been very humbling for me. 

I have been recruiting since October with nothing.

But back in January, I started looking for a regular, part time job as well. I found on Linkedin for a Head Spa‚Äôs front desk receptionist. Turns out, they opened up in November 2024, so they were fairly new.

I got to the interview stage with the hiring manager (who was the CEO) and I had asked if she was open to summer interns since she was a new company. She said she was open to it, but nothing was final. 

I didn‚Äôt end up getting the receptionist job because I didn‚Äôt really have receptionist experience, but she was impressed with my finance background and projects, so she scheduled a coffee date with me in February to talk about possible internship opportunities. But it didnt go through, and I basically got ghosted, so I figured she just didnt want to deal with me anymore. I was bummed, but moved on and kept applying other places.

The rest of February and March go by, and I still had no internship. So, last resort, I messaged her again basically asking if she was still interested in an intern. 

She got back to me quickly. She apologized for the coffee date, and said that her spa was very busy and she had remembered me and my background still. She said that I could work as an intern, but unpaid. This is because the internship program was never a finalized decision, especially since their company is really new. And she had not planned out the financing to fund interns at that time. Atp I was fine with it, especially because she wasn‚Äôt the one who offered in the first place, and my college gives us stipends for unpaid internships. I was also planning on working part time there, and part time at my current job so I could still have some money over the summer. So we‚Äôre meeting this upcoming Monday to talk about how I can contribute, my schedule, etc. A very important note is that the application deadline for the stipend is May 2nd! 

Heres the issue: Literally the day after we arrange a date, I get two messages. One from a recruiter from a pretty well known financial company and she said she viewed my profile and wants to schedule an interview for their Wealth Management/Financial Advising internship. I thought it was fake at first bc most LinkedIn messages I get are either fake or ads. But we had two mutual connections with people that worked there as well, so I knew it was real. We have an interview scheduled for Tuesday. But this process clearly will go well into May. I had actually applied to this company for their FP&A internship, so I‚Äôm not super thrilled about the job bc I hate the investment management side of finance, but its still in the field I want, so I‚Äôll take it if I get it.
The second message is from a known apparel company for their finance internship I applied for, and they asked me to complete a video interview (like Hirevue). I did pretty good with that interview, but theres no guarantee I‚Äôm going to get it. 
Plus, both of these opportunities are out of state. And since it‚Äôs late, I will have to rush to find housing (one gives a small stipend, idk about the other), and a subleaser for my apartment which will be hard bc I have a windowless room, and live with 3 other girls in the apartment. 

What i‚Äôm scared about is when these people will make up there minds. Like I said, the deadline for the stipend is May 2nd! I‚Äôm probably not going to hear back from the two companies for at least a week! I don‚Äôt mind telling her that i‚Äôm still looking for other opportunities, but I dont want to waste her time by having her make an offer letter for the application, discussing my duties, making my schedule, and then being told ‚Äòoh nevermind lol I got the other opportunity‚Äô Especially since I was the one who reached out to her! But I also dont want to be like ‚Äòwe should wait and see what the other two say‚Äô because if I dont end up getting them, now I have an unpaid internship with no stipend! Yes I would still be working at my current job to get money, but that extra $2,400 would really help! And even worse, she could take back her offer because I cant make up my mind, then I would end up with no internship at allüò≠

Not to mention, the spa is in my area, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to find new housing. Also, my apartment is paid off for July (its a long story as to why), so I would only have to worry about June rent which I can easily get within the next month. 

I‚Äôm hoping that the recrutier for the apparel job will watch my videos fast and just make their decision by Monday so I can know.

But what can I do in the meantime to ease my mind? How should I got about this?",2,1745509053.0,internships,2,1.0,False

in social isolation, my mind is always occupied with the past and imaginary future. It keeps switching between them. ""The moment"" almost doesn't exist at all.

First, the beginning is almost one to one with the original, only difference is that Crystal is not riding Speed's back, only Flare. Later, Speed doesn't get ran over by Lazuli, instead Flare, Crystal and Sunshine go to the treehouse without Speed, and Lazuli almost rans them over. Speed and Sunshine don't try to hide the father daughter relationship they have. And perphabs the most important difference, Lazuli doesn't abuse Speed even once

In the second chapter, Speed is shown to be some sort of engineer, as he's crafting a device. Leaf give a ribbon, like in the original, but when Speed sees her, his reaction is sweeter. And the important stuff, Silvia, instead of teaching Sunshine to use flirting moves on her dad, she teaches her how to make a shortcake and later gives them to all the squad. Extra, when Pearl tells Silvia to look after Sunshine for her, she goes to Black to tie him up and for some reason put him into a pi√±ata. Writing this made me realize that I liked when Pearl antagonised Black

In the third chapter, the start is almost identical to the original, only differences is that Lazuli uses Ice Beam on Silvia prevent her from telling Speed that she loves him, (also, Speed and Black are talking in the background). Also, Sunshine is carrying a cup of coffee for Speed, which is funny and cute. The warehouse is cut, which may be dissapointing to some, I have the feeling it was intentional, which i'll get to in a bit. The part when Lazuli apologizes for being rude to Speed kinda came out of nowhere but the next part makes up for it. This chapter hints at Speed and Lazuli meeting in the past, which is probably why the warehouse was remove

Im disappointed and so happy at the same time!","I was a child and in HS when this game come out Im sure I played on PS3 freely(??) but it was lagging so much I had to delete after throwing the shotgun. I even remember playing on a mobile device but this can be a wrong memory dont trust me on that.

This game is so popular and Im happy finally got to play THE GAME that created maybe many companies and games now I will go shortly over episodes and the some things I really didnt like.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**E1: I thought Holy heavens,** this is as great as they say, it can be even as good or better than Tales from Borderlands, atmosphere, characters are great Lee and Clementine connection is as good as it looks from outside. We get to the motel.

I dont like Lee being a murderer held over his head, Clem already knows, half of the group knows and he gets thretened with this, Lee is one of the greatest people you can find in an apocalypse and his vibe tell that, I dont think people cared anyway when he told them.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**E2: The moment I see the brothers**, I understand they are evil, okay but Lee doesn't, so I play along. We go to the ranch and forest, a woman implies Danny did something, Lee gets suspected a bit. Then Lee asks Brenda **if he can see his bow-shot friend and she says NO.** I mean at that point, I said, no way. Then Lee sees a fuking KILLHOUSE still no reaction.

We are in an apocalypse and there is my shot friend inside the spooky ass electric farm's main house and you dont show me? IM getting Kenny & rest and busting inside that house no matter what at that moment PRONTO. classic helpers are evil episode, try to make us shock with cut legs, etc, these are cheap stuff. CHEAP. Voice acting and stuff are still good.  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**E3: After the sourness of E2 I lost hope** more than Kenny when things go slightly wrong. BUT Something worse happened. LILLY FUCKING SHOOTS CAYLEY IN THE HEAD FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. Then game asks me if Im taking Lilly in the van. Hahaha?! Im gonna take someone who killed an innocent person what is this a joke? I even thought of deleting the game but we are close and Im wondering. This is the lowest point of the game for me.

Then we found a train. A whole train, and we met with **Chuck** of all people, a great character, then sad stuff happens to kenny but we get to use the TRAIN, great set piece, but what we see a goddamn truck full of petrol dangling, now this is fun, then we get 2 more great characters. Omid and Christa

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**E4: Molly another great character comes swiftly as she goes**. Ben tells our great LEE that ""he is not like him so he has to tell kenny"" everybody already knows lee murdered someone and a person who cant form 2 sentences makes judgemental analysis about how he is not like LEE YOU KIDDING ME BEN YOU STUPID.

WHY YOU DIDNT TELL LILLY ABOUT WHAT YOU DID AND WAITED FOR 2 SEASONS MORON. TELLS KENNY ABOUT WHAT HE DID IN AN EXTREMELY TIME SENSITIVE SITUATION AND KILLS BRIE. Ben is at this point probably has most kill count in post walker era of world.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E5: Nothing to add Great start, Great end, not pushy, not trying to send a message. It flows to end.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bad Parts**

\+ In a game that is pure story, that doesnt even have point and click adventure elements, story elements could be better, I know this is still a game but its basically a TV Miniseries. You dont go and kill 20 people between cutscenes.

**Good Parts**

\+ Lee and Clementine

\+ People so focus on what is right or wrong and righteousness on ANY subject, they could burn the world still wanna be righteous, this story doesnt do that, people doesnt try to counter every argument they hear, writers of this game are writers. There are usually 3 choices of dialouges not you are right or wrong. Reference points are abundant.

\+ This game is mentally soothing, its like mint ice cream for me and coffee (At the same time, dunked mostly)

\+ Characters, Characters, Characters!

\+ Voice acting, animations, graphics and art direction.

\+ The ""theme music"" you know the one, the general atmosphere

\+ It's a complete package with 400 Days.

\+ Story is great and every event from finding a train to search for boat, reveals itself slowly, we are feeling it folds upon us, we are through a journey in the country, its like The Last of Us 1 (My fav game)

**Strawberry On Top: 400 DAYS**

NOW I GET TO PLAY 5 substories with 10 characters I found and connect immediately? And the last woman that tried to get them to the base. That was fun, Every story was short but instantly felt like characters were people I know deeply. But I only achieved to get 2 of them, I feel bad :D

Anyway, it was great, stories written as 1 book or 1 movie doesnt do well on continuing series and Im guessing twd is written as 1 game too, but I will at least watch first hours of the games.",7,1745508719.0,TheWalkingDeadGame,1,1.0,False

We tried between March 14-18. On March 28, I had what seemed to be a full period. Lasted 5 days, normal flow, a couple heavy days then lighter. Fast forward to April 9, which would be day 13 of my April cycle, I had some spotting on and off for a few days. Today, I woke up and threw up, and came downstairs only to be repulsed by the smell of coffee (which happened to me with previous pregnancies). So I just thought I‚Äôd take a test - my easy @home tests were positive but they are expired so I took a recently purchased first response test and that too was positive. We never ttc in April. I‚Äôm making appts with the appropriate practitioners but just wondering if anyone experienced this - where what seemed like a full period was actually implantation bleeding or something else?

Long story short, I am feeling depressed about dating. Shocking, I know. No one else feels this way do they?? (sarcasm).

Anyway, I‚Äôve been on dating apps since I was 18‚Äìliterally before I even got out of high school. I am now 25. I‚Äôve not received a lot of romantic attention growing up mostly due to my weight. I have always been obese. Recently, I‚Äôve lost some weight and I‚Äôm at the age where I feel pretty confident about myself and in my own skin; I dress well, I have good hygiene, I am a good person, and I‚Äôve been growing in confidence and think I‚Äôm attractive.

A while ago, I got off dating apps becuase they‚Äôre just terrible. I also felt like I was addicted to them. I started putting myself out there more through a ‚ÄúSocial Group‚Äù in my city. I‚Äôve met a lot of new men. I even had a crush on one of them, but ultimately after learning more about him I lost it (we‚Äôre not compatible). That lasted for about 6 months. Now, I got back on dating apps to kind of bolster the ‚Äúputting myself out there‚Äù; for example, I‚Äôve recognized some people that I see out on Hinge or something and will be like ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve seen you at this weekly trivia event! :)‚Äù type thing. 

I‚Äôve messaged people first, I‚Äôve asked them out for drinks, I‚Äôve talked to people I wouldn‚Äôt normally just to test the waters and experiment with what I like. But nothing is working for me. I‚Äôm not going on dates‚Ä¶ and the crazy thing is, I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm not even looking for love or anything like that. In fact, I want to be reckless and just have experiences to know more about what I like! I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and haven‚Äôt had that yet and I want to. I already missed my high school and college years bu going on a couple dates and had one situationship that I can barely even count as that. And I know, I know, everyone goes at their own pace, but I‚Äôm ready for something and I can‚Äôt even get my foot in the door. It‚Äôs slightly confusing me.

I genuinely cannot put myself out there much more than I have. I‚Äôm in the social group and have attended events including a weekly one. I‚Äôve been on dating apps. I am a regular at many local coffee shops and food places. I go out  to bars on the weekends. I‚Äôm involved in local clubs and such. I just literally don‚Äôt know. It makes me feel like it‚Äôs genuinely due to my looks. I am still overweight, but genuinely a lot of these people look like shit, let‚Äôs be real! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm so bad that this should be the case. Maybe I‚Äôm overconfident, but I highly doubt that. 

I‚Äôve deleted the dating apps again. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do from here. I‚Äôm kind of considering moving out of the area or something. Maybe a change of scenery will work for me. ",2,1745508531.0,women,2,0.75,False

I dug my fingernails into the earth beneath my lifeless body. Trying to claw myself away from the woman with the knife. The woman whom I thought to be harmless. The woman who is trying to kill me. Kelly came in as a thief in the night, small, feeble, and scared. She weaseled her way into my life, into my gang, and into my husband's bed. When she saw, I wasn't going to go away easily, she hatched a plan to take me out completely. ‚ÄúGrey is mine. This child is ours. You are in the way Evelyn, always in the way.‚Äù The woman said as she stabbed me again. I couldn't feel the knife go in anymore. The blood tasted metallic on my tongue. I begged her not to kill me and she laughed. Everything was turning black as the woman continued to talk. ‚ÄúI will have Grey as my own always. We will raise this child together. I will lead our gang by his side as his wife. You and that pain in the ass friend of yours cannot stop me now.‚Äù It sounded as if her voice was coming through a tunnel. I saw something silver, a flash, and everything went silent and dark.

*Evelyn‚Äôs Pov*

I woke, covered in sweat. The memories flooded my mind of before. Kelly, the poor orphan girl, cutting my skin with a smile on her face. The smell of the forest tickled my nose while the metallic taste of blood overpowered it. I took a deep breath. Though I was aware of the past, I couldn't shake the unbelievable truth in it. I had known Grey since we were children. My father entrusted him with the future of what he had paid for with blood and sweat. A large part of his life that he could never get back. He put his entire world in his hands, his business, his family, and his daughter. I was unable to give this family the thing they wanted, I know, an heir. A child to raise the way we had been. Trained to run a Mob so great it was ruler of this part of the world. I walked to the bathroom, splashing my face with cold water. My phone tinged in the other room, probably Sana. She is usually the first person I hear from in the morning. To know she was alive to send me a message this morning brought tears to my eyes. She wouldn't understand. I have not told her of the memories of the life we had lived before. I had not told anyone. Only months prior, she also lay cold and dead from the wounds inflicted by that psychopath, Kelly. Sana had been my best friend for many years. She was my confidant, and one of the only people I trusted in the world now. I splashed more cold water on my face, this time adding some soap. Sometimes seeing the haunting of the bruises left there before I was awakened. I was given a chance to change the events, and I will do so. After brushing my teeth, I walked out to find an outfit for the day. Some nice black tights, a small black skirt, and a button-up red top will be just the outfit for the day. I must look my best for the day of our adoption of the new mistress. Her poor father, and that awful accident he must have suffered. Except he didn't, and I know that now. I looked out the window and saw the little black bird sitting on the tree branch. The same little bird I saw the morning she came the last time. I heard the clock chime in the hall and was thrown back to this day. I knew Greta, one of my personal servants, would walk around the corner and smile at me as I opened the door. I know I will smell the scent of coffee brewing in the kitchen. This is the first day of all the mistakes I made last time. The day I met Kelly. The day I met my murderer. This will be the day I change the future that I know is coming, the one I was given the opportunity to correct. I put on some simple flats and chose an updo for my hair. Solid black eyeliner, and some red lipstick to match the blouse. I grabbed my phone, replied a ‚Äúgood morning gorgeous‚Äù to Sana and stuck it in my bra. I always kept it closer to me now.

When I walked out the bedroom door, I smiled sweetly at the guards. There were always guards surrounding the castle that Grey and I had built. He wants to act like he did this all on his own. He did not. My father handed the keys to the castle to both of us. I have put in just as much time and effort, if not more, as he has in this business here. The gang would answer to me if I could just get in good with some of the men from his side of the merger. I have their respect sure, but I need their support, and their trust. When I walked into the dining area, I sat down at the end of the table that I always do. The end that belonged to the queen. I looked up and saw Grey staring at me. Surprised I think by my appearance on such an ordinary day. It was only an ordinary day for him. He doesn't know the knowledge I was left with when I woke up. I thought my life had ended, but it has just begun. No longer under the bondage of a lifelong commitment to a man I had known for ages. Grey Hunter, the leader of the Mafia that we have both built. The young man who wrecked his father‚Äôs car and called me to bail him out. The man who sat beside my father‚Äôs bedside for days to ensure his place in the kingdom. The man I believed loved me, until I could no longer give him the life he wanted. He looked at me for a long time before speaking. ‚ÄúHello Evelyn.‚Äù He said smiling at me, making me want to gag in front of him. I chose to smile back. This won't work if I show him my hand. ‚ÄúHello Husband. How has your morning been?‚Äù I asked sweetly. He waited before he answered, choosing his words carefully. ‚ÄúOne of the men in the city was hurt badly. He didn't make it. He has a daughter. Her name is Kelly Russo. She is still young. She needs our help. I thought maybe we could take her in. We have many rooms in this house, and food to share. I thought we could give back to community by taking in this young woman. She needs our help.‚Äù The words came out of his mouth smoothly, like he had rehearsed them many times in his head. I had a flash too before. I looked up slightly before she walked in. Her head down, tears streaking down her face. Her dark hair was stringy, like she hadn't showered. Her face was dirty and blotched from the tears. She really did look a mess, considering she had planned this whole thing out. She was thin and pale. Freckles decorated her like polka dots. She was very pretty, though I could just be biased, since she killed me. She wouldn't look up, speaking softly, quietly mumbling something about her appreciation. A flash in my mind reminded me of my pity on her before, how I wanted to help this obviously terrified woman. I wanted to take her under my wing and give her the strength to rebuild for herself. I felt sick when she started to mumble more. ‚ÄúIs she saying something? You aren't a child dear, you are a woman, speak up if you want to beg for something!‚Äù I said loudly watching the expressions on both of their faces. Her lips tightened and she fought off the urge to show her vicious side so early in this game she was playing. He was surprised at my attitude, and calmly asked Kelly to leave the room. ‚ÄúGo and get yourself something to eat darling, while I speak with my wife.‚Äù I heard the disgust come from the tone of his voice when he called me wife. He motioned for one of our maids to escort Kelly to the kitchen.

When she was gone, Grey looked up at me. ‚ÄúWhat was that about? Don‚Äôt you think that girl has been through enough? You were overly rude, and that isn't like you, Evelyn. Are you feeling okay today?‚Äù he asked, still shocked that I didn't jump up to save her. His plan wasn't playing out like he had thought, and it bothered him. ‚ÄúI do not know what you mean? I was only implying she speak up when begging for charity?‚Äù I said smoothly, smiling up at him with my sweetest smile. ‚ÄúWell, I would like to help this young woman, she is orphaned, and as you know I will never have a child of my own. I thought it could be practice for when we adopt in the future since you cannot bare my children.‚Äù What he said hurt but I didn't allow him to know that. By this time, we had grown a crowd. Men from both sides of our gangs had gathered around to watch the show. They tended to do that in situations like this. The arguing had gotten so bad before that they were mostly trying to make things stay safe between us. At one time all we needed was privacy to be wrapped up inside of each other, but that was long ago. That was before we found out I couldn't give him an heir. When we were trying almost daily to get pregnant. When we were happy and in love. Before the resentment and pain. Before the words that have been spewed in hatred, words that can never be taken back. Love that can never be returned. Even before the death I suffered, I was suffering. We argued about everything, all the time. I looked at him still amazed at the changes that have happened between us over the years. He noticed me staring and looked away. I looked down at my breakfast. I didn't want to eat anymore. I took a sip of my morning coffee. Grey looked up at one of the guards and asked him to fetch Kelly. ‚ÄúI expect you to be nicer to her this time Evelyn. I mean it.‚Äù The way he still thinks he could tell me what to do made me want to laugh, but I didn't. I sat there like a good wife. The one he thinks he still has. The one this very sad little orphan took away from him. The one I will never be again. She won't win this time. This time when she walked in, she looked directly at me. Braver I see, believing I had a talking to and was going to give them what they wanted. Permission. ‚ÄúWhat do you think, my queen, about helping Kelly out until she can find herself a place in the gang. I believe she will one day make a great asset for us here.‚Äù I looked up at her and smiled. ‚ÄúSo, what are you asking me, Grey? If she can live here, for a while, or if she can become a part of the gang we built together here?‚Äù He sighed and looked at me. ‚ÄúYes, I think that is what I am asking.‚Äù His voice seemed smugger now. Not clarifying what he meant. I knew he wanted her to live there, and she wanted to stand beside him as the queen of my gang. ‚ÄúI don't think we need any more strays running around here.

This has happened with a [coffee cake](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/coffee-cake-recipe/#tasty-recipes-73631), a [lemon blueberry loaf](https://butternutbakeryblog.com/lemon-blueberry-loaf/), and a [vanilla cake](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/vanilla-sheet-cake/#tasty-recipes-72026) (vanilla cake in the picture).

I tested my baking soda and baking powder and replaced my baking powder, but side by side the old and new one are reacting exactly the same way. 

I just ordered an oven thermometer because I read maybe this is due to the oven not getting hot enough? I haven't been having these issues until recently and I moved here in September, so not sure if this could be it. I've also heard this could be due to overmixing so lately I've been finishing mixing everything by hand instead of with my stand mixer.

Would appreciate any thoughts! I measure out my ingredients on my scale. To the coffee cake I added strawberry jam which I know probably added a lot of moisture, but didn't really change anything on the other two. I think I used different sized pans but I pay attention to the color, springiness, etc. of the cake to make sure it's done before I pull it out instead of relying on the bake time the recipe calls for.

I've been baking for about a year and a half and this is the most trouble I've consistently had with getting things to turn out right so having a bit of a baker's identity crisis.

I'm a mom to a 6-month-old, working from home, and haven‚Äôt really been out much these past few weeks, especially not for more than an hour at a stretch.

I always prefer having someone with me.

But today, after a client meeting in Anna Nagar, I did something different. I stopped by a cafe alone. Just sat down, had a coffee, grabbed a quick bite. It was only 30 minutes but it felt so good. Peaceful and quiet. A little bit of a guilty pleasure but something in me really needed it. Will I do it again? Not sure. But this memory is going to stay with me for a long time.

P.S. I accidentally picked the worst possible cafe for a solo visit (The Board Room in Anna Nagar, definitely not solo-friendly) but it was a unique experience and I don‚Äôt regret it.",35,1745508257.0,Chennai,3,0.93,False

I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone. My sister in law is part of the CSO (basically parents involved with the school system) and has been an active member for a while. 
Now for the chunky back story. There is another member of the CSO (we'll call her Kate) who is very active in the community. She coaches the cheer team for ages 4-8 and volunteers at all the school events for both the primary and intermediate school. She was my daughters cheer coach and while she seemed to be an ok person, you could tell she was the ""smile in your face, talk behind your back"" type. So currently they are doing the Teacher Appreciation Week for the school district and were asking for donations from local hot spots such as gift certificates to pass out to the teachers as gifts. There is a small coffee shop in our area, privately owned, who has only been open for a little over a year. While everyone in this area goes there, we aren't talking about a Starbucks or any sort of large company. My sister in law, who goes there very often, asked the owner if she would like to make any donation to go to the teachers. The owner, Lindsey, agreed and gifted a $25 gift card. So back to Kate... Kate found out through the grapevine that Lindsey had donated a gift card and pushed for more information. Long story short, Kate was livid. She stormed out of the CSO meeting and called Lindsey to berate her on how terrible she was for only donating $25 and demanded Lindsey donate 59 more gift cards to cover all 60 teachers. As it always goes, Lindsey happened to be friends with the director of the school and relayed the conversation. The director went back to the principal and now there is an investigation going into it. Kate is steady defending herself by saying that Lindsey was rude and Kate was simply trying to get more gifts for the teachers. My sister in law was horrified and apologized on behalf of the CSO and Lindsey seemed to be making light out of the situation. I have watched the Charlotte Dobre videos for a long time and my first reaction was, ""where does she find the audacity in bulk"". I will definitely update when there is a result of the investigation. Thank you for sticking around. ",3,1745508133.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone! We own a Kava lounge that also serves lattes. We are in need of a high quality espresso machine. We do not quite need a commercial set up due to the fact that coffee/espresso is not our primary item we sell. Our primary seller is our crafted kratom teas and kava. We have been using a De‚ÄôLonghi Dinamica automatic espresso machine that was gifted to us. We had it for a little over year and it has stopped working. We would like to upgrade to the best option available that is still user friendly. We make about 10-15 espresso shots a day for lattes. Our price range is up to $2500 if needed. I‚Äôve read that Breville and De‚ÄôLonghi are the best brands but I have also read that there are much better options out there. Please send all recommendations!! I need to order one asap today!

A weird guy is calmly walking around the city, minding his own business. As he stares at some players who are speaking to each other, he lets out a short silent sigh, then enters a cafe, where there are few people here. All of them are colorful, don't worry. Approaching the counter, a teenage employee looks up from his phone, notices him, and smiles happily. He greets him, asking what he would like to get, to which the mute grey adult starts to think, his right hand under his chin. Does he want to drink coffee as usual...? Or does he want something else this time..? He proceeds to grab a nearby menu and opens it, he flips through it for a bit... and stops at one page. Showing the boy, he lightly taps twice on an image of a box filled with donuts. The young employee then tells him cheerily that he made a great choice, it will be ready soon! He nods once, pulls out his wallet, takes five dollars out and hands them to him to pay. He thanks him as he places the cash in to the register. The weird guy strolls over to stand near the entrance, and he waits. A few minutes pass, the teenager calls him over to grab his box of donuts, which he immediately teleports right up to the counter, slightly spooking him. Giving him a thumbs up, he picks it up and leaves the cafe as he stares at it.

He continues to saunter through the city, then opens the box to take a random donut out to eat it. As he does so, little does he know, there's a grey teenage employee following him, he has a blindfold on. When he reaches him, he gently pats him on his left arm which is carrying the box of donuts to get his attention, causing him to turn to stare at the nervously sweating boy. Gulping a little, he somewhat bravely asks if he can come with him to his workplace, he needs his help with something. Though, before he could do anything, the grey player proceeds to hold his now-free right hand to bring him over to a small-ish restaurant. They enter it.

""*LOOK AWAY, EVERYONE!!*""

Almost instantly and fearfully, every grey employee turns their head to either look at a wall or the ground as they sweat profusely. Slightly lifting the blindfold and obviously not looking at the weird guy, he explains that their boss made them like this because he was being an asshole to everyone, even him. Like, for NO reason at all! Then, the grey boy politely asks if he can do something about him, he nods once in response, patting him on the head lightly twice to let him know that he 'said' yes. After this, he puts his box of donuts on an empty table, and the teenager takes him to his boss' office, saying that he's in there talking to some person on the phone. What does the mute grey adult do? He cracks his knuckles, as if he's been waiting for this moment the entire time. The grey player then leaves him alone standing at the door, running down a hallway to probably tell his co-workers about what's about to happen. The weird guy teleports in to the room, and the large adult player gets somewhat startled by him as he pulls out his sign. Angrily, he demands he gets out of his office NOW! He doesn't feel intimidated though, it seems like he got used to people yelling at him all the time. A few seconds of them staring (or in the business boss' case, glaring) at each other, the boss stands up from his chair and loudly repeats himself, threatening to harm him if he doesn't leave right the fluff now!! But, the mute grey adult has another idea... he starts to approach him as he clenches his sign tightly, making the large player back away from him, to which he grabs his chair and points it towards him. He furiously yells at him to stay away or else he'll kill him!

Still no feeling of intimidation, the weird guy swiftly snatches the chair from him then tosses it across the room. Now, the business boss is becoming afraid, sweating a little. As he turns to flee, the mute grey player, using half of his super-strength, almost immediately grabs him by his shirt, and proceeds to throw him down to the ground. Before the large jerkass realizes it, he starts to stab him everywhere across his body repeatedly, making him shriek in agony. As he's about to deliver the final blow to finish him off, the weird guy stops, teleports to the chair he tossed, places his sign behind his back again, then grabs it. Nonchalantly, he strolls over to the bloodied boss, who looks up at him in horror and pain, and strikes him as hard as he could on his head, shattering the furniture into pieces in the process, also killing him in an instant.

Now that his job is done, he lets out a little silent sigh. Teleporting back to the entrance part of the restaurant, the grey employees are still looking away, which is good. As he doesn't want to stay here any longer, he picks up his box of donuts and exits the establishment.

He resumes to wander around the city while he eats his delicious, sugary sweet snacks...

I'm a 36-year-old guy who was dating a 27-year-old woman, Sara, for a couple of months. We met at a friend‚Äôs wedding, from the same community/town/friends, had a great conversation, and she seemed highly genuinely interested. Over the next five dates, I kept things respectful and chivalrous. I was also trying to be THAT guy who does not sleep with her too soon. She showed a lot of interest (complimenting me - physical, always accepting dates, playful touching, deep conversations, etc.), but there was no physical escalation beyond kissing, and she never initiated texts, she usually took at least 1-2 days to respond to my texts, as I tried to use texting to set up dates only (3% Man - Corey Wayne). We had 5 dates total during about 8 weeks. I asked her what she wants, about her past and current men, and why she takes so long to respond to texts, etc, and she said she is very busy with work (9-5pm), although were are not exclusive she is only dating me now because she can't put her attention/focus with more than one guy at once, wants to take things slow because she‚Äôs dating for marriage, etc. (Recently, I also heard rumors that she used to hook up with guys easily, party girl before).  
After our last, fifth date on August 2 (a 5-hour date, 2 venues), I sent a follow-up text the next day just to check in because she‚Äôd had a lot to drink and got home late with class the next day, and she replied 24 hours later (as usual), which frustrated me, so I stopped caring/communicating due to her inconsistent communication and low engagement. We had this exchange:  
**Text Interaction After August 2, Fifth Date:**

* **Sara (August 4, 1 PM):**¬†‚ÄúHa no I did not make it to class.‚Äù

That was it for two weeks until she suddenly texted me on August 17 out of the blue. I decided to call her out for her consistent 1-2 day response rates again (regular mail joke), and an inside joke about how we met with wedding photos. We exchanged these messages:  
**August 17-20 Text Exchange:**

* **Sara (August 18, 12 PM):**¬†‚ÄúWeek was crazy busy but lots of fun. Yes, so ready for London and honestly to just check out for a little. You ready for your brother's wedding?‚Äù
* **Me joking about her delays (August 18, 5 PM):**¬†‚ÄúWith this response rate, you might as well just send me letters by regular mail. When do you leave and get back from London again? Yeah, I‚Äôve arranged for all the bridesmaids to take a picture with me.‚Äù
* **Sara (August 19, 10 AM):**¬†‚ÄúHaha I am jealous I didn't even get a picture. I'm gonna be away for closer to a month. So quite a long trip.

* **Sara (October 26, 10 PM):**¬†‚ÄúHey! How are you?‚Äù
* **Me (October 27, 10 PM):**¬†‚ÄúGreat, super busy, you?‚Äù
* **Sara (October 28, 9 AM):**¬†‚ÄúBusy is good. Got any plans for Halloween?‚Äù

I did not respond to her last text October 28, also knowing I would see her at the charity event she was hosting the next evening (she probably knew too). At the charity event on October 29, she approached me, hugged me, and asked about my Halloween plans (again). I told her I had plans/party and she said she had nothing going on. She told me her one month trip in London lasted one week because she got sick temporarily and came back home for treatment with health insurance (\~2 day sickness). I empathized. I asked her and she answered that she reached out now out of the blue recently because she recently went to the restaurant with her friend that I took her on our third date and realized she had a lot more fun with me and laughed a lot more with me. I playfully asked if she reached out because things didn‚Äôt work out with ‚Äúthe other guy,‚Äù which she denied, taken aback, acting shocked I‚Äôd even suggest it. I changed the subject, mentioned I‚Äôm very busy, working on expanding my business and moving to the city (where she lives), she asked about it and I answered, then told her I did not mean to take up too much of her time, she said she is heading home now anyway, and then we said goodbye/hugged. (She evidently also signed up on dating apps right after returning from London ‚Äî My friend saw her profile as a ‚Äúnew user‚Äù in the city early September).  
We did not see or contact each other for another month until November 28, when she texted me again out of the blue again:

* **Sara (November 28, 3PM):**¬†""Happy Thanksgiving! Hope you have a great day with the family""
* **Me (November 29, 9AM):**¬†""Thanks, I hope you had a great Thanksgiving."" She did not respond.

* Why wait until¬†**October**, then¬†**November**, and then¬†**April**¬†to reach out again, instead of following up sooner like she said she would?
* What was the real purpose behind each of her random reach-outs? (October 26, Nov 28, April)
* Would she or will she actually ever come over for a coffee?  For what?  To hook up?

Complimented my outfit, said some inside jokes, then we said bye.

Then¬†**April 13**, she texted me again out of the blue:

* ***Sara (Apr 13, 10AM):***¬†‚ÄúHey Happy Palm Sunday!!!‚Äù
* ***Me (11PM):***¬†""Hey Happy Palm Sunday, nice to hear from you.‚Äù
* ***Sara (next day 9PM):***¬†‚ÄúAll is well?‚Äù  *I didn‚Äôt respond after that.... she texted a week later*
* **Sara (Easter Sun, Apr 20, 8:30 AM):**¬†‚ÄúWe never ended up getting that coffee.‚Äù (She double texted) 
* **Me (Sun, 10:20 AM):**¬†‚ÄúYeah we didn‚Äôt. What a shame, I make a great coffee.‚Äù
* **Sara (Sun, 11:00 AM):**¬†‚ÄúWell now I gotta know what I‚Äôm missing out on.‚Äù
* **Me (Sun, 12:20 PM):**¬†‚ÄúWhat if you get addicted to it?‚Äù
* **Sara (Sun, 1:00 PM):**¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll take my chances.‚Äù
* **Me (Sun, 2:00 PM):**¬†‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre willing to take the risk, come by later.‚Äù
* **Sara (Sun, 7 PM):**¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Easter. Maybe next weekend?‚Äù   (She is not that religious and much less religious than me btw)  I did not respond back and won't.  So I‚Äôm left wondering:
* Was she ever¬†*genuinely*¬†interested, or was I just a backup option, validation source, or emotional crutch? or what?
* Why did she say she wanted to ‚Äúgive this a fair shot‚Äù after London ‚Äî yet ghost for two months, even though the trip was only one week?
* Why wait until¬†**October**, then¬†**November**, and then¬†**April**¬†to reach out again, instead of following up sooner like she said she would?
* What was the real purpose behind each of her random reach-outs? (October 26, Nov 28, April)
* Would she or will she actually ever come over for a coffee?  For what?  To hook up?  
* Was she¬†*trying*¬†to slowly claw back in after things didn‚Äôt work out elsewhere, or just keeping a connection alive for ego/security?
* What would you make of this overall situation? How would you have interpreted her behavior?
* How would¬†*you*¬†have handled this differently ‚Äî especially those random reappearances?
* What do you think I did¬†*right*¬†vs. what I may have done¬†*wrong*?
* I‚Äôve moved on, I‚Äôm not looking to rekindle anything, I was just curious to see if she would actually come over. But I‚Äôd love to get your perspective as a learning experience. Advice/Feedback? Thank you!",1,1745507995.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

I'd like to introduce myself telling you that I'm Chilean, from Santiago and I love languages (currently very interested in french and Italian), books and travel. I have a partner and two kittens.  I'm a very curious person, the kind of guy who enjoy reading articles in Wikipedia or going to foreign places using Google maps. I also like YouTube and watching series on streaming platforms. In person I like going to bars and drinking good coffee and trekking. I think I'm a very good listener if you want that kind of friendship though I don't like when friendships are one sided or people who just tell you their problems. 

The main reason I'm here is because I used to have penpals in the past and that was really fun and my close circle of friends is now limited to my girlfriend and her close circle, my work colleagues and a side project related to my profession so in practice I have no IRL friends from my side. I'd like to meet people here and see where it goes. 

I'd be interested in people who might be into a short length but continual communication on Reddit at least at the beginning. Not really interested in long letters anymore as they become a chore to write and send. Last time I had a penpal he sent to me a dollar bill like some sort of little present I didn't ask for (dollar bills among all bills are the least special, they are everywhere) and he made me feel obligated to send one local bill back. Never heard from him again. So let's keep it online for now hahaha

I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy at 17, it was all normal. I felt like now that im older things had settled down, I eat pretty well, workout 3 times a week ect ect. These past few months I have been trying to up my fiber as I‚Äôve heard so many things about cancer rates in my age group (I am 23F), so more leafy greens, wheat pasta ect ect. 

So now recently I feel like my health is crap, I thought it was winter or idek, I was having headaches daily for like a month which I finally have gotten them to settle down, just weird little health issues but recently I‚Äôve been feeling good, except a bit constipated which isn‚Äôt normal for me I‚Äôve been upping my water (I already drink a lot to begin with) and trying to ease up on the fiber a lil, I have also been taking magnesium for my headaches as I read it can help but I know it can also cause constipation so im trying to not take it daily just like every 2-3 days. 

Anyways this morning, I always have to go after my morning cup of coffee. So per my routine I did but it wasn‚Äôt normal like I was so constipated lmao. Anyways I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have been straining but like I had to go lmaoo, anyways after I wiped with a baby wipe and it was like a lot of blood, like if I was on my period type of blood and there were also drops in the toilet, all bright red and a few super tiny like clots I guess? Idk.. I also have a lot of mucus in my stool but they told me at 17 I had ibs so I always just brushed it off. Anyways im due for my physical so im gonna call and also bring this up but idk all these little health things just have me concerned especially this morning like that‚Äôs never happened to me. Also I have had fissures before and it‚Äôs definitely not that like I know that pain, so idk maybe an internal hemorrhoid? That‚Äôs just my guess, also the other day when visiting an urgent care I had high bp which I thought was weird for my age, anyways im gonna visit a doctor but im just wondering if this sounds like it‚Äôs hemorrhoids or like idek what could it be something more like it‚Äôs all connected or is this separate?",1,1745507796.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

Words of Affirmation 

You

You‚Äôre needed here

I could love you if words moved you 

I would write songs if what‚Äôs the matter consumed you 

You built a foundation, you made a beautiful creation 

You woke up from your nightmare and you made your dreams a reality manifestation 

I need you 

And if I could tell it to you like it was the first time again 

I will 

And before you think this is me working out my insecurities 

I hope that you know that I‚Äôm telling you to be sure 

I‚Äôm telling you not because I need to tell to be heard 

I need you, and I want to be there for you too. 



Quality time

Chop chop chop 

The veggies and the cheese 

Lay out on the cutting board,

An extra pillow with our charcuterie

Forget the blue tooth speaker, there are whispers in the air 

Songs from the times we had no idea what we shared 

We planned a vacation next month, for you and me 

I made sure to book a trail guide through the mountains and the beach

And when the honeymoon sinks and that sunrise shines through 

Flowers do climb the windowsill 

Pique the morning, another adieu 

Spending time alone together, yes 

But also let me spend time wherever you find yourself alone from me 

Making memories is not only the icing on the cake 

It‚Äôs also that, in being there, it‚Äôs you and me 
And that‚Äôs that. 




Gifts 

When I think of you, I feel like I need to give you more

I could give you little nothings to explain when I thought of you with that

If I could get you your new favorite hoodie

Or get you a new tool for your box

If I could get you a tattoo or a watch 

I would save up and spend it on you

Just to see the crinkle in your eyes from that smile 

From me to you 

If I could bake your birthday cake, even though I hate to try 

Or surprise you with something I made

With two hands and you in mind 

I could give you a poem, or a picture, or a book 

But if I could give more, to give you peace of mind

I‚Äôd give you everything 

And anything of mine 



Service 

Can I clean your car? 

Can I pack your lunch for work tomorrow? 

Can I be sure your things are ready and right where you need them when you want them? 

Can I walk your dog? 

Can I bring you a cup of coffee? 

Can I show up and sit pretty for you at your favorite place and thank you? 

Can I do your dishes? 

Can I make the most of your time? 

Can I run the laundry, pick up take out and make you cum in the same night? 

Can I take your picture? 

Can I make you laugh? 

Can I pray and serve dinner and find comfort in you asking? 




Physical touch 

Kisses in the hours between last night and tomorrow morning 

I hold your hands under the table while your mother misunderstands me 

A hug means more to me than a poem or a goodnight

And I get so excited when the goosebumps rise 

But there‚Äôs not a high without you 

And all the aches and vague expressions 

You are the happiness I can hold onto 

Bring life into my existence 

I can weave my fingers in between yours 

Your hair a knot for me to unwind 

The truth, without riddles

I want to touch you all the time

My palms along your chest, touching eyes

Hearing you sigh 

To tell you that you mean so much to me

To express without explaining why

As a person, I am someone who is confident around other people in general but when I fall in love with someone I become naturally submissive and strive to become the best version of myself that I possibly can be. 

Acts of service: my dream in life is to perform acts of service where I am solely responsible for all the house chores, cooking, laundry and even making sure that your shoes are clean. This will be in addition to working a full time job. 

Acts of kindness: I would love hold an umbrella over your head, carry your bag, serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask, run errands for you, driving you around to different places. 

Health and fitness: I watch my weight, exercise and eat healthy most of the time. Occasionally, I indulge myself with an ice cream, chocolate dessert or a pastry. 


WHAT DOES NOT MATTER TO ME IN A PARTNER

Religion (I will respect what you believe in) 

Anger issues: does not matter to me

Character and Personality: Since, I am a person who can adapt according to my future partners personality and character, this is not something that is important.

Level of Education: I got an executive level job without a Degree years ago (now I have one) due to my other strengths and capabilities. This is why, I feel that my future partners level of education is not important.

Hairstyle: hair colour and style don't matter to me. To be honest even if you were bold and wearing a wig it would never bother me.

Location: As long as I have someone I can love and care about, location does not matter as I have lived in different places in the world such as Jungles, Mountains, the coast where the beach was just 40 meters away and every day I would wake up to the view of sun rising over the Ocean. Even if we don't live in the same location at the moment we can be friends and keep in touch on Facebook or Instagram, althought it is on Facebook that I roll out updates that are happening both in my personal and professional life. This way we can figure out how we make this work and as soon as the opportunity presents itself, we can meet, get married, and where I will be yours forever. Many people think that distance is a problem, but in reality, it is not.

Your past: whatever you did in your past does not matter as I believe that everyone deserves a second chance in life. We all make mistakes, but learning from those mistakes and becoming a better person is what what matters.

I'm in the mood for a slice of life kinda game.

Platforms are: Switch, Steam, soon Switch 2.

I'm not really looking for anything that's big on combat or stressful or very time-sensitive. But can be a time-sink as I'm currently on sick-leave for depression and burn-out.


I hope this isn't too vague in terms of what I'm looking for. There are two directions I'm in the mood for.

1: It's been a while but I remember really loving the slice of life aspects from persona 5. So if there's anything like that that would be great. 
I think they are quite often recommended for that aspect but I started one of the Yakuza games and they were not for me. 

2: Another direction this could go into.
I just finished coffee talk 1 & 2 and got va11-hall-a. So anything along the lines of crafting and selling stuff with a chatting/getting to know your customers aspect would also be really nice.

I also really love preparing food stuff or a heavier side on the crafting than farming aspect, like in Venba, coffee talk or the my time series.

And something with a plot or definitely neighbours or other npcs about whose lives you can find out more. 

I usually love all sorts of farming Sims like coral island or wylde flowers. 

I got Animal Crossing for the switch but games like this where there is also a big emphasis on decorating your space are really not for me.

I'm holding out on early access titles for now. But if there are titles that actually feel very complete for being EA I'd be open. 

I've already played (and loved): 
Rune Factory 5,
wylde flowers, 
potion permit, 
graveyard keeper, 
my time series, 
Stardew Valley, 
the recent story of seasons games, 
coffee talk 1/2,

In case they have made significant progress.
I either already have and am waiting waiting for updates to get into again or then buy: 
coral island (last June),  
fields of mistria (in January), 
chef RPG (feels this could be perfect), traveler's rest(also January), 
I am future (a year ago)

Have, but doesn't feel like the vibe for now: medieval dynasty, 
roots of Pacha, 
Moonstone Island (seemed way too simplistic upon starting), 
Littlewood, 
Spiritfarer, 
Lake (but more because of janky graphics),
VA11-hall-A,
Planet crafter

Don't intend to buy:
Kynseed
Sun Haven 


That post got way longer than expected. If you've gotten this far thank you soo much! 

TLDR: looking for cozy slice of life or crafting and selling wares game with a story. Not too much into the mood for big emphasis on farming but also not a no-no if there's enough other stuff to do.

So in Highschool, I‚Äôve been in a lot of friend groups, but really had one group that I come running to everytime. It‚Äôs a trio girl group.

We‚Äôve been besties since then.

Came college then work life, we always kept in touch. Always a casual coffee dates or lunch outs.

Now, I am a first time mom. They have been with me through this journey since I was pregnant.

Then, the other one had recently broken up with her long time boyfriend. Now, I of course be at her becking call because I know how that hurts. I was exhausted from during the night feeds to my daughter but I woke up when she called/texted.

I then saw this on IG: ‚ÄúAnd suddenly I stopped reaching out first, and I haven‚Äôt heard from them since‚Äù

I realized that I always reach out to them, that is why we always kept in touch all through those years. Even if I am juggling being a mom and my career, I always make sure I text them.

Now, I cut them off December 2024. I wanted them to reach out to me. To ask me how I am doing. How their god daughter is. But until today, nothing.

I wanted to know, is it too much? Am I being petty? Because my husband says I shouldn‚Äôt act that ways since they were my besties. And that I should accept that they have their own lives to worry.

Thank you for your patience and grace as I've fully settled in as moderator. In the last month or so, I've been able to completely clear the modmail and reported-posts queues, and tweak settings to automate routine administrative tasks. And also to think through the future of our community!

I'd like to share some updates about the governance of this subreddit, going forward. What you see here supersedes anything I've previously put into a post, and ties to information in the new wiki. It's a lengthy post, so refill your coffee mugs first. :)

**The Purpose of** r/authors **& Posting Requirements**

This community is focused on authors who have already published at least one book. As such, content that's germane tends to focus on stuff like marketing, metadata, sales practices, series management, printing and distribution, and advertising. The needs of this community prove more advanced than the kinds of questions posed by people who have never been published or who have never written a book before.

Reddit is filled with subs that handle basic craft and publishing questions. Accordingly, any posts that are at the ""author 101"" level will be removed as being off-topic. To help people find a more on-point sub to help answer their questions, I've curated a list (in the wiki) of [places to go for help](https://www.reddit.com/mod/authors/wiki/index/getting-help).

Almost all of the posts that are removed for being off-topic come from new reddit accounts. To protect the community's purpose, we've installed Automoderator, which enforces some basic rules about who can post and comment. To post, you must have combined site-wide karma of at least 25, no negative comment karma, have an account at least 14 days old, have at least 2 positive karma within the subreddit, and not be in the ""lowest"" category of Contributor Quality Score. To comment, you must have an account older than 7 days, with minimum site wide karma of 10.

Posts and comments that do not meet [these thresholds](https://www.reddit.com/mod/authors/wiki/index/post-requirements) are held for moderator approval. In almost all cases, they are deleted because they do not conform to subreddit rules. In other words, Automoderator works as intended.

To obtain karma, post and comment. Your comments and received upvotes increase your karma score. Note that there's a difference between site-wide karma and in-subreddit karma.

**Our Rules and Approach to Moderation**

We encourage everyone to [follow our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/authors/wiki/index/rules/). In general, we moderate by removing offending posts. When you've had several posts removed, we either send a modmail reminding you of the rules or -- if the violations are egregious -- we ban you.

Four things will earn an immediate and permanent ban:

*  Unambiguous, indefensible violations of Rule 3 (civility). Usually, slurs and infantile insults.
*  Blatant advertising.
*  Posting spam very obviously unrelated to the purpose of this subreddit. 
*  Responding to the moderator with sarcasm, condescension, whataboutism, or discourtesy. The statement ""if you have nothing nice to say, stay silent"" is relevant here; we generally do not require you to actually respond to modmail. So far, three people have been banned for mod abuse, and in every case, that outcome was easily avoidable.

Not every post and comment is reviewed by a moderator. We therefore encourage folks to use the report function (responsibly, of course). Most reports result in content removal. We often allow borderline cases, especially if they've engendered useful conversation.

**Transparency**

To be an optimal steward of this community, the lead moderator will occasionally (2-4x/monthly) post a digest that includes a few administrative notes, links to active posts you might have missed, a summary of moderator actions (bans, removals), and ... wait for it! ... book-launch notices.

We've installed the sub-stats-bot to highlight these things, too -- and any of you are welcome to look at it at any time. Bot reports are [listed in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/authors/wiki/sub-stats-bot/).

**Promotion of Books & Services; Content Marketing**

One enduring controversy in this community lies with the question of book promotions. Our rules currently do not allow promotions by others (spam) or promotions by an author (self-promo). These guidelines ensure that this sub doesn't turn into yet another wall of advertisements. However, given the target audience, an outright prohibition on new releases seems strict, and a poll taken last month bears this out.

So, going forward, we will allow authors to [promote their books](https://www.reddit.com/mod/authors/wiki/index/promotions) in a very specific way. First, to be eligible, the author must have a minimum of 50 karma within the subreddit and no history of rules violations. Second, the book must have been published in the last 90 days or be verifiably released in the next 90 days. If both criteria are met, the author is welcome send a modmail that lists the book title, genre, ISBN/ASIN, release date, publisher, one hyperlink, one image, and a three-to-five-sentence teaser for the book. That information will be shared in two consecutive moderator-digest posts (mentioned above) and will be [permanently enshrined](https://www.reddit.com/mod/authors/wiki/index/community-books) in our wiki.

We think that this approach is preferable to a periodic promotional mega-thread, which tends to get ignored. The minimal karma requirement means that the only authors who are eligible are people who have already meaningfully engaged in the community. So, we'll circumvent the drive-by author who doesn't actually care about this subreddit.

Another tricksy problem? *Content marketing*. We've endured a non-trivial number of users who use this sub for active content marketing. Either their user accounts are tied to a marketing agency, or they occasionally drop references to their newsletters or consulting services amid other posts that are genuinely useful. Going forward, content-marketing efforts will be banned when they're identified. User accounts that very obviously link to paid services -- especially when their expertise is mentioned and private messages are encouraged -- will also be banned.

**Post & User Flairs**

For now, we're not using post flairs. I've expanded the user flairs to include other stakeholders in the literary landscape that are relevant to the purpose of the sub. Because flairs are intended to highlight special users instead of being a generic label for everyone, we've removed the self-pub and subsidy-pub flairs from the roster. People who had them previously may still keep them. In addition, to request a flair, you must have a minimum of 25 karma within our subreddit. (Most of the requests came from people who had never actually posted or commented!) See [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/mod/authors/wiki/index/flair) for details.

I feel extremely uncomfortable with his behaviors regarding the children, but specifically the behaviors for/toward her?

The boys HAVE to help with all chores, car cleaning, caring for pets(including hers). She comes home from school and sits in her room all day, on her phone/watching tv while everyone else works(weekends too). I‚Äôve asserted myself stating she must have A chore too, washing dishes after dinner. 

He will not allow this, and ends up doing them, but not without browbeating me that I am not ‚Äúhelping him‚Äù. 

She‚Äôs often out spending time with her friends, when the boys aren‚Äôt able to, nor does he humor their friends coming over. (It only happens when I don‚Äôt ask him, and just bring the friends over) 

She has a 40k credit card stored on her phone-he doesn‚Äôt even allow ME to have any access to his credit cards, let alone the boys..says it‚Äôs ‚Äúin case of emergency‚Äù She‚Äôs 14/15, and very rarely in situations where it could be an emergency, but rather uses the credit card to go shopping when she‚Äôs out with her friends. 

Without my consent, or even communicating with me went and purchased a $200 electric scooter for her, that the boys aren‚Äôt allowed to ride. He says it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo fast‚Äù but is the type that is able to be governed for speed. 

She doesn‚Äôt wake herself up for school, and is often late. When she is tardy, instead of making her wait at the school to avoid detention(she plays sports, so detention would prohibit that) he will take her to Starbucks for coffee. 

I‚Äôve tried bringing this up to him. Explaining that the rest of the kids see the unfair treatment and are going to resent him. 

But it feels extremely uncomfortable and not your typical stepdad/daughter relationship.

He was unfaithful to her mother during a couple of years and they divorced. Ever since, their relationship was always rocky.
Sometimes they are fine and can have a coffee just ok, other times they just can't be together without arguing.
My partner also, at times, seems to withdraw from having any relationship and avoids contacting him.

I sometimes feel she's unfair and jumps the gun too easily, but I also understand I lack some context and history between them to better understand. I tend to get judgemental of her at times but am trying to avoid that and just be supportive.

How should I proceed? I think it's fair to call her out at times, but in this case that is very hard without seeming that I'm siding with her father. To be clear, I think he's the one at fault most of the time.

Author:¬† Last Updated:2024-04-18 10:24:58

**ARIA'S POV**



My husband and boss Adam, is laughing at every joke that leaves the lips of his first love while I watch them through the glass doors that separates his office from mine. I had been dutifully preparing some documents that needed his signature and also setting up his meetings for the day like I have done for 7 years as his secretary but since Sophia‚Äôs arrival, I have been unable to get any work done.



I feel a pang in my chest every time Adam laughs, almost tearing up at the thought that he has never laughed like that around me. I stare at her slender frame, her lush black hair that bounces back into place even when she throws her head back in laughter and the grace in every of her movements. Sophia is an epitome of feminine grace and every of her features is proof of why Adam has been hung up over her even though they separated years ago. Even though he married me.



The dark binds of his office are brought down abruptly, blocking my view of them both and now all I can see is black. It is as if Adam is trying to prevent me from prying even though I am his wife and privacy shouldn‚Äôt be a thing between us, especially when it comes to a woman he used to love so much.



I still remember how shocked I was when she walked up to me earlier, heels clicking ever so sophisticatedly on the office tiles. I saw the feet cladded in shiny red heels before I raised my head to look at her.



‚ÄúAria, I didn‚Äôt know you still worked here! I can‚Äôt believe Adam is still making you work even after you both got married. That man is something, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù



She said, smiling sweetly with blood red lips that would look horrifying on me if I dared to try that shade of lipstick. I couldn‚Äôt speak, caught in the shock of staring face to face with her after all these years, especially as she still had the same aura of wealth and confidence that I have always known her to possess. For a split second, she made me feel insecure in my gray office wear and my tight bun hair and the fact that I wore little to no makeup.



‚ÄúSophia!‚Äù



Adam‚Äôs voice was what broke me out of that trance I was stuck in as he stepped out of his office and there, right in front of me, he hugged her ever so tightly like an old time friend before he led her back into his office without sparing me as little as a glance.



Now, they are alone together in his office, the blinds of his office pulled shut so that I can‚Äôt see them but can only hear their muffled voices and his own laughter every now and then. I squirm in my seat uncomfortably each time they laugh, gripping the edges of my table tightly and too destabilized to get any work done while they are both holed up in there.



I stare at the calendar on my table. Today‚Äôs date is marked with a red marker and I sigh deeply. Does he even know today is our third wedding anniversary? Every year, it seems like I am the only one who remembers it and now with Sophia‚Äôs appearance, I can already tell that today will pass by like it‚Äôs just another day.



¬†I knew she was coming today. Being his secretary is the only reason why I knew the things Adam would rather keep from me. He already briefed me about a new business partner that just returned to the country two months ago and will be at the office at any time. What I didn‚Äôt know or should I say, what he purposely kept from me was that the so-called business partner was Sophia Bradley and perhaps the reason why he has been more cold and indifferent than usual, ever since her return.



My heart aches at the realization but it aches even more because there is nothing I can do about it. I have never had a place in Adam‚Äôs heart but he has been the only one in mine. I loved him from the very moment he saved my life years ago but I can say the same for him.



He always reminds me even without speaking, that our marriage is nothing but an attempt at fulfilling his grandfather‚Äôs wishes and I knew if he had gotten his way, he would have never looked at me twice, not to talk of getting married to me.



Grandfather‚Äôs love for me is perhaps the only reason I am still sane in this loveless marriage. The old man never ceases to show how much he cherishes me but when has that ever been enough? I am married to Adam and not his family.



The clock ticks endlessly, yet Adam remains in there with her.



Their laughter dies down all of a sudden and I can barely hear a word they are saying. Unable to hold back anymore, I stand before the restlessness kills me. I am his wife and I deserve to know what is going on. To look natural, I quickly make two cups of coffee. After all, I am his secretary and this is a part of my job.



Nervous sweat breaks out on my forehead as I make my way to his office with unsure steps. Inhaling sharply, I open the door and step in. My heart clenches at the sight of them both, relaxed in each other‚Äôs company as they sit so close to each other on one of the couches in his office. I swallow hard and try to walk over to the table with the best confidence I could muster.



‚ÄúI made coffee.‚Äù I say but they don‚Äôt even acknowledge my presence, lost in each other and whatever they were discussing. I study Sophia for a moment, watching as she twirls her cherry blonde hair with a finger while seated with one leg crossed over the other to reveal a provocative amount of thighs, smiling so brightly that I can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs faking it.



I want to turn around and leave but my feet fail to move. I can‚Äôt just leave like this. For how long will I keep quiet and suck it up?



‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I call, looking directly at Adam. We are married but he never fails to remind me that I address him as my boss at work. Adam doesn‚Äôt even make a move to look at me and anger rises inside of me, slowly boiling.



‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I call again and that is when he finally regards me with a cold look that almost deters me but I remain firm under his gaze.



‚ÄúThere is something I need to talk to you about, it‚Äôs important.‚Äù¬† I lie right through my teeth. I can feel Sophia‚Äôs gaze burning through me but I try not to look at her, for the fear that my confidence would slip away if I do.



¬†Adam just waves me off.



‚ÄúIt can wait. As you can see, I have a guest.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt wait.‚Äù I say, even more firmly but he is already back to smiling and listening to Sophia speak like a lovesick teenage boy. I call him a few more times and unable to hold back any longer, I call him by his name instead.



‚ÄúAdam!‚Äù



They both look up at me with a mix of expressions. That of Adam is pure anger while Sophia is obviously irritated. I know she has never liked me and back when I was just his secretary and she was his girlfriend, she complained about every single thing I did.



‚ÄúAdam, what is this? Is this how you let your employees disrespect you?‚Äù She says it with absolute disgust and disrespect.



I am stunned at her words, so stunned that I scoff. Employee? She dares to talk down on me like that even when she knows fully well that I am not just an employee.



Adam stands, his tall frame causing his shadow to sweep over me while I grip the tray of coffee tightly in my hands.



‚ÄúAria, out. Now.‚Äù He commands and I am filled with so much hurt that my hands shake and my lips quiver.



‚ÄúWhy should I? I have every reason to be in this room and I have every right to speak for you to listen to me.‚Äù



Sophia stands at once.



‚ÄúIt seems as though your wife has a bone to pick with me and I will not sit here and take such insults.‚Äù



¬†She begins to walk away and of course, Adam follows her. I try to move out of her way but my attempt fails when her shoulder heavily bumps into mine in a way that is too fierce to be considered unintentional. I lose grip of the tray and stagger forward and just like that, the hot coffee spills all over her very expensive looking dress and mine. She shrieks, backing away from me only to glare at me the next second.



‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you?‚Äù She yells. Adam rushes to her side in less than a minute, fussing over her stained dress and even offering her his handkerchief while I stand there, drenched in coffee as my husband takes care of another woman. I feel the tears prickling at the corner of my eyes but what does crying in front of this woman make me?



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you! What did I ever do to you? Go ahead and dislike me all you want but there is a limit to how far you can go and you just crossed that.‚Äù She says again, seething in uncontained anger.



Adam turns to me, eyes dark with rage. It makes me shiver. Makes me feel unimaginable pain to know he is mad at me because of another woman.



‚ÄúApologise right now!‚Äù He commands and I scoff. How can he stand there and take her side when I did nothing wrong?



‚ÄúWhy should I do that? I have done nothing wrong. She bumped into me!‚Äù I defend myself, my voice breaking. Lips quivering.



‚ÄúI did no such thing!‚Äù Sophia says defensively but her eyes tell a different story.



‚ÄúYou heard me, Aria. Apologize to her right now.‚Äù Adam says again, still intently looking at me. I almost laugh at the fact that the only time he is looking me directly in the eyes after three years of marriage is when another woman is involved.



I shake my head, finding all of this hard to believe.



‚ÄúSo you believe her over me? You take her words for it but mine does not matter? I am your wife.‚Äù



‚ÄúA wife I never wanted to marry!‚Äù¬† He yells back and shatters what is left of my broken heart.

------------

Did you know many people try to lose weight? People look for easy ways. Pink drink is one drink people ask about. I hear pink drink and weight loss often. So, is it good? I want to tell you about this drink. I will tell you what is inside. I will tell you if it helps you lose weight. I will also tell you about good drinks for losing weight.

This writing tells all about pink drink. It also talks about if it helps you lose weight. Now, you know what I will write! I want to make it easy to understand.

What Exactly IS the Pink Drink? (And What's In It?)
---------------------------------------------------

Starbucks has a drink. It is called pink drink. The pink color comes from strawberry. It uses acai and coconut milk. Strawberry Acai Refresher is the base. Coconut milk makes it creamy. They also put freeze-dried strawberries.

So what things make pink color? Strawberry Acai Base is important. Coconut milk changes the taste. Freeze-dried strawberries add more fruit.

You can ask them to change the drink. You can use different milk. You can ask for less sugar too. This will change how it tastes. Also how much you weight.

Pink Drink Nutrition: Calories, Sugar, and More
-----------------------------------------------

Pink drink has calories. It has sugar too. How many depend on size. It also depends on what is inside. A big size has many calories. It also has much sugar.

If you change the drink, it changes how many calories. Less sugar means less calories. Change the milk can also change.

Pink drink has more calories than coffee. It has less calories than Frappuccino. So pay attention how many calories. Drink it and think good. It is all about being healthy and fit.

Can the Pink Drink *Really* Help with Weight Loss? The Truth
------------------------------------------------------------

### Is the Pink Drink Good for Weight Loss?

The simple truth? Pink Drink can not make you lose weight on own. It is not a magic drink. Losing weight need the exercise and good food.

The pink color is good to look. But that is all. Do not think just drink the pink drink for the quick weight loss. It is not very correct. The weight loss is hard.

So, keep the Pink Drink just for fun. Drink and feel good. But exercise. Eat the good and healthy. Think this way.

### The Role of Calories and Sugar in Pink Drink

Pink drink has calories. Calories make you gain weight. So you do not want many calories. You want less calories. Then you lose weight.

Pink drink also has sugar. Sugar is also not good. Too much sugar make you fat. You want to avoid much sugar in the body.

If you drink it too much, it can make problem. So, better you just drink it only small. Only once in a time. That is good for you.

The Potential Downsides of Relying on the Pink Drink for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Pink drink can hurt you. It has much sugar. Too much sugar is bad. It can give you problems. It can cause the weight gain.

It also has flavors. Some flavors are not good. They are not natural. You should eat real food and no so much sugar.

Pink drink also cost much money. Buying much Pink drink can hurt the money. Buy healthy food to cook. And the exercise is free!

Healthier Alternatives to the Pink Drink for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------------

### Low Calorie Pink Drink Alternatives

I have some alternatives for pink drink. These are good to lose weight. Drink water with fruit slices. It is low in calories.

Herbal tea is also good. It has zero calories. You can also make a pink drink. Add less sugar to make the new drink. I feel good.

You can mix. You can experiment. You can keep it low in calories. Then you will weight loss and happy.

### Healthy Drinks for Weight Loss

Green tea is good. It speeds up the body work. Black coffee is also good. It wakes you up. It has zero calories.

You can add fruit to water. Water is good for health. Protein shakes help you build strong. Drink and be strong.

Eat good. Drink good. And the healthy body for you. You will smile all the day.

Pink Drink Weight Loss Results: What to Expect
----------------------------------------------

Do not think pink drink makes you thin. Pink drink is just the sweet. It does not have magic for weight loss.

The Pink Drink can fit in your eat plan. But you have to work. You need to count how many calories. The Pink Drink can add to that.

Doctor can help you. Doctor can tell you what is good for you. So go see the doctor. Doctor will give you the plan.

Conclusion
----------

Pink drink tastes good. But do not drink it for the weight loss. Too much sugar and calories are not good. The weight loss does not come easy.

Focus on good food. Make sure to move the body every day. Do not eat too much. Just eat enough. Do not drink too many sweets.

I'm 28, 184cm tall, a cis male, & in the last 6 months I have committed to 16-20 hour fasts 6/7 days a week. I typically have a ""cheat"" day every now & again as I do enjoy a cheeky brunch w friends.

Anyway,

I started out at 87 kgs & had lost 10 kgs  about 5 months in & have since plateaued around 76-78 kgs.

I look much better - I have never been ""overweight"" per se but I did have a belly/noticable love handles. My muscles & face are more toned, people positively comment on my appearance more than they used to. 

But the biggest change is how I feel - which is, generally, fantastic. I feel free of the ""constantly hungry"" feeling I had when I would spread out my meals & snack more. I feel lighter & more energetic, I've saved hundreds of dollars on food I was otherwise over eating & without worrying about what I'll need for breakfast - my mornings are now a lot more productive. 

I do, of course, get some cravings but I placate these with a mild black coffee about 90 minutes after I wake up.

I know these habits won't suit everyone. But they've changed my life very very positively. Changing my relationship to food has literally changed everything for me. ",1,1745506085.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

I have a bunch of little questions that I'd feel bad making into separate posts and flooding the subreddit with, so I hope it's alright just to put them all down here and see if anyone has any answers.

1. Is it worth taking down all our posters and wall art? We have sort of an absurd amount in our apartment, so it does offer the roaches quite a bit of hiding spots- but I figure they can't actually create nests behind there, can they? 

2. I have one electronic appliance that I know for sure the roaches got into, a xbox series x, which we've already frozen to kill the roaches inside (yes the xbox still works). Im confident the bugs are dead, but Is there a way to get the bugs out of an appliance short of fully unscrewing it and taking it apart? Or is it safe to just like, leave like this? Its in a enclosed plastic box now, and I'm almost entirely confident the only roaches inside of it were nymphs. 

3. Do we have to worry about the roaches infesting our coffee machine, microwave, and/or our window ac unit? And if so, how do we handle it? Particularly with the microwave and ac unit, we can freeze and take apart the coffee machine 

4. Is it safe to use a infested washer/dryer? The entire apartment complex is infested and, while I haven't seen any yet, I don't doubt that includes the extremely humid, wet and nasty laundry room. Just want to know if its alright to keep using those machines or if I should just bite the bullet and accept having to pay more to use a nice laundromat 

5. Any allergy medication suggestions? I have horrific seasonal allergies and usually take the Costco brand allergy med (weird pick I know, but its the only one I've tried that works and doesn't make me drowsy.) The roaches have increased my allergies tenfold and now that we've begun treatment and theres dead roaches in glue traps during the day its even worse. My normal meds aren't cutting it and I'm willing to try any others if it means I'll no longer be sneezing my guts out all day 

If anyone can answer even one of these questions I'd really appreciate it, also just want to thank this sub in general.

I woke up on my floor, the belt lying next to me. I sat up slowly, I think all my joints were cracking.

But I felt really good, honestly. I haven't felt this good in months. Like all my pent up anger, doubt and everything else I've been bottling up has been erased. However, I do have a disgusting, metallic taste in my mouth. With a surprisingly light step, I almost pranced into my bathroom. While brushing my teeth, I suddenly spat out brownish-red foam. Was that dried blood, had I bitten my tongue in my sleep?

I felt like going to my favorite bar for the first time in a long time.

It was an old-fashioned pub, a rustic wooden building with a few stuffed animals on the wall. You can usually come here to have a beer and listen to the old men tell their supposedly legendary hunting stories.

It was Chris' turn to tell the story, he was my age and we went to the same elementary school. You could recognize him by his beloved red and black checked jacket, which he always wears when he goes into the woods. He was a nice guy, but a rather mediocre shot. However, he seemed to be having more luck lately, bringing home a new kill almost every day.

Then Walter, our local ranger, spoke up.



‚ÄúYou won't believe me, but when I checked my wildlife cameras this morning and looked at the night-time photos, I almost had a heart attack from the shock of seeing a huge wolf running into the picture.‚Äù

He held up a photo as if to prove it. The picture did indeed show a wolf staring into the camera with glowing eyes and looking really unnaturally large.

Loud and unintelligible murmurs spread through the pub, and after a few minutes it was agreed that the giant wolf would be the new main target of the local hunting party.

I'd had enough for the day and decided to go home. Once again I put the belt on at night, but instead of writhing on the floor in pain again, I lost consciousness straight away.

I came to the next morning, lying at the foot of my bed with the blanket wrapped around me. When I went into the kitchen to make myself a coffee, I noticed that the entrance to my front door was completely filthy. However, I explained that I had forgotten to take my shoes off at the front door the night before and had brought all the mud in with me.



The rest of the day went as normal, I went to college, came home, did my homework and went back to the bar for a few beers in the evening. That evening, Walter told us that he had found a dead, half-eaten deer in the forest earlier that morning. It had apparently been killed by the huge wolf.¬†

A few weeks have passed since then, but the wolf has not only restricted itself to wild animals, but has also killed some of the local farmers' sheep.

Around the same time, I also noticed some changes in myself. I'd lost a lot of weight, I'd never really worked out, but when I stepped out of the shower the other day and looked in the mirror, I noticed that you could already see my ribs. Also, my beard and fingernails are growing much faster. I noticed this when I had to shave twice a week instead of just once.



Then came the news that shocked the whole town: there had been a death.

Walter our forester found a male corpse on his morning forest tour. It was an open secret that the students had a stash of alcoholic drinks or cannabis in the forest. Officially, it was said that the exact circumstances of the death had yet to be clarified. Walter, however, confessed after a few beers that the man had clear bite wounds, which he said were definitely from a wolf.

¬†The local gun store was completely sold out the next day. Every amateur hunter and gun enthusiast wanted to get their hands on the giant wolf.¬†

However, I was preoccupied with something completely different at the time, because I knew the dead man, but to be honest I wasn't sad or shocked at all, because well, let me put it this way. I hated this guy. He was always bullying me and pushing me around at college. That's why my sadness was really limited at the moment.

  


But somehow the whole thing seemed to have taken more out of me than I thought, because that evening I forgot to put my belt on for the first time and went straight to bed.

I had a nightmare that night. Well, the dream itself wasn't really bad, but it felt so real. Do you know that? You have a dream that isn't really scary or bad in itself, but it feels so real that it's the real horror.

My dream looked like this, I was standing in a dark forest and wrapped around me was a huge black snake with glowing yellow eyes staring at me like I was its next breakfast. The moment its mouth opened and it shot towards me, I woke up.

As I said, it wasn't exactly the worst nightmare, but I was still soaking wet from top to bottom. But what was much worse was that I felt terribly miserable again, as if everything that seemed to have magically disappeared since I started wearing this belt had returned.



So it didn't help, from this evening onwards I will be wearing the belt again.



After a while, calm returned and the death was written off as a tragic wildlife accident. But just when I thought this was just a one-off incident and that everything would soon be back to normal, there was another death.

This time, unlike the first, it wasn't in the middle of the forest, but on a remote country lane leading to the town.

And this time, too, I knew the victim. She was my ex.

I'm sure you can imagine what a spectacle the media made of it afterwards, so I'll spare you the details about the ‚Äúkiller wolf‚Äù.

To cut a long story short, people usually only left the house armed, no more after sunrise, children no longer left unattended and everyone jumped at the slightest rustle in the bushes. Well, the typical chaos and panic.

I sat back on my couch that evening and stared at the ceiling. We hadn't parted on good terms, there had been some very bad words between us. But still, news like that doesn't pass you by without leaving a mark.

Since my watch was already showing midnight and I was still far too agitated, I decided to fall back on my grandfather's favorite sleep aid. A double whisky.¬†

Maybe it was more than one. Anyway, after that I just fell into bed. Without the belt. But this time I had a nightmare.

I was standing in this dark forest again. A few meters in front of me was this H√§ndler, staring at me with vicious yellow eyes with slit pupils.

He stretched out his arms towards me and his gray cloak began to fall apart. It fell off him in shreds and as soon as the shreds hit the ground, they became...rats. Big gray rats that crawled towards me.

‚Äú***Pay me!***‚Äù he shouted at me in his hissing, raspy voice.

Then I woke up.

My T-shirt and a bed sheet were completely soaked with sweat, and the alcohol from yesterday was still burning in my throat.

I think I drank a whole liter of water in one go.

I noticed that I had two spots on my forearm, they look kind of like a snake bite.

Now I'm sitting at my kitchen table with my head resting on my arms.

¬†What the hell is going on here? Something is very wrong here.

Why is a wolf showing up right now and killing people? Why is it two people from my neighborhood of all people? Who is this strange merchant? And most importantly: what's wrong with me?



So many questions and I damn well want answers. It's semester break right now. I think I'll do some research.

When the mind refuses to update its reality.

You know you should move on. You tell yourself you have to. But it‚Äôs like your heart didn‚Äôt get the memo.

You wake up thinking about them. Memories hit you out of nowhere. You try to distract yourself, stay busy, move forward‚Ä¶ but the ache lingers. It‚Äôs frustrating‚Äîbecause deep down, you do want to let go. But something inside keeps pulling you back, almost like your mind is working against you.

I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs not just about grieving a person.
It‚Äôs about grieving the version of you that existed with them.

That‚Äôs what makes detachment so hard. You don‚Äôt just miss the person‚Äîyou miss the way you adapted to them. The inside jokes. The way they looked at you. The energy they brought. Even the arguments. It all became part of your routine, your identity. Your brain doesn‚Äôt crave what‚Äôs good for it‚Äîit craves what‚Äôs familiar. That‚Äôs why so many of us get stuck, looping in the past.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been learning (and practicing):

1. Speak to your brain in its own language.
Write down the ways you still expect them‚Äîlike texting you, showing up, calling‚Äîand replace those with new routines. The brain learns through pattern and repetition.

2. Close open emotional loops.
If you didn‚Äôt get closure, write them a letter‚Äîbut don‚Äôt send it. Just let your mind finish the cycle.
If you‚Äôre haunted by what-ifs, give yourself a mental deadline: ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt come back by [x date], I fully release them.‚Äù
Whisper unsaid things to yourself‚Äîyour nervous system just needs to let go.

3. Trigger a new YOU.
Change something symbolic. New scent. Different coffee order. Sit somewhere new.
Pick a name for the version of you that‚Äôs healing. Ask: How does this version of me think, act, feel? Then start living like them‚Äîbefore you even believe it.

4. Reclaim your nervous system.
They were once your source of emotional safety. That‚Äôs gone. So make new sensory anchors.
Change your ringtone. Light a new candle. Use a different shampoo. Your body needs new familiarity to feel safe again.

5. Expand your emotional world.
Breakups shrink it. You don‚Äôt just lose them, you lose the version of you that felt things deeply.
Watch a film that makes you cry (not about them).
Laugh‚Äîeven if it feels fake. Your body doesn‚Äôt know the difference; it still heals.
Seek awe: sunsets, concerts, deep convos, art. Remind your nervous system that there‚Äôs more to life than this pain.

And lastly‚Ä¶
Your brain holds on because it thinks it‚Äôs safer than starting over.
But your job isn‚Äôt just to ‚Äúmove on.‚Äù It‚Äôs to rebuild yourself into someone whose mind and body no longer seek them.
And when that happens‚Äîyou won‚Äôt just wake up ‚Äúover it.‚Äù
You‚Äôll wake up as someone who can‚Äôt even relate to the version of you that once thought they were irreplaceable.

1k6twz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BariatricSurgery/comments/1k6twz3/day_4_out_of_21_preop_diet/,Day 4 out of 21 pre-op diet,"Hi everyone!

It‚Äôs day 4 out of 21 for my pre-op diet. I just want to say that it does get easier and thankfully I had a small class yesterday going over a little bit about the  diet, what I can or can not have I also see my dietitian today to further explain my diet and go over supplements. 

Struggles so far
- I can barely tolerate the bariatric advantage meal replacements. They are too powdery and grainy for my taste. So hopefully I can fine the replacements if allowed.

- the unjury chicken broth is absolutely disgusting as well and I had to double drink at the same time broth then immediately drink water otherwise I would‚Äôve thrown up when doing a taste test. üò≠

- meeting the 64oz of liquid not including shakes and broths. That‚Äôs a struggle as I typically don‚Äôt drink throughout the day in general. I‚Äôm trying to get as close as possible but it‚Äôs definitely something I need to approve on. 

Things I like/are okay rn

- I was extremely tired the first two days but yesterday and today my energy seems fine

- Found out I can have coffee which is a life saver for switching things up. I really enjoy mixing unsweetened cold brew with a fairlife vanilla flavor. 

-I can have one banana or 8z of 1% milk to help with my potassium levels. (This is great as I‚Äôve been through this program before and needed hospitalized two days before my surgery back in 2019/2020 with failing kidneys from a infection and low potassium levels)

- I hoping they let me stay on fairlife as they are imo the best protein shakes for me flavor and tolerance wise. I did enjoy unjury chocolate and vanilla flavors. I also don‚Äôt mind their unflavored. 

- my programs as a medical approve protein bar chocolate and peanut butter from unjury brand. They hit. 

You all CAN do this! I‚Äôve lost 7 pounds so far.

1k6tuvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k6tuvn/can_amazon_basics_cm1091aul_coffee_maker_deliver/,Can Amazon Basics CM1091A-UL Coffee Maker Deliver Quality? Detailed Review Inside,"The Amazon Basics CM1091A-UL Coffee Maker, with its sleek black and stainless steel finish, initially struck me as a promising addition to my kitchen counter. Its compact size immediately appealed to me, fitting perfectly in the limited space next to my microwave‚Äînot something many coffee makers achieve. The automatic drip system was a feature I was particularly curious about, given my regular morning routine hinges on a good cup of coffee.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee machine was its minimalist design. The combination of black and silver feels modern and adds sophistication to my kitchen setup. At 7.09‚Äù D x 11.81‚Äù W x 12.13‚Äù H, its compact design is ideal for smaller spaces like my office cubicle or even my dorm room during college visits. Surprisingly lightweight for its size, at just 2.91 pounds, it‚Äôs effortless to move around. However, despite its portability, the plastic components didn‚Äôt scream high-end to me. They seemed functional but might not withstand heavy-handed use.

**Simple Operation**  
Daily use has shown me how straightforward this coffee maker is to operate. Brewing coffee involves pressing an ON/OFF button, with a bright indicator light making it clear when the machine is active. Even my not-so-tech-savvy dad could operate it without asking for guidance. It‚Äôs refreshingly free from complex settings or unnecessary touchscreens, which takes the intimidation out of the brewing process. Still, anyone looking for advanced brewing features might feel underwhelmed.

**[Check Amazon Basics CM1091A-UL price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b084zh769p/)**  

**Reusable Filter and Maintenance Perks**  
One feature I found particularly thoughtful was the reusable filter basket. Avoiding disposable paper filters doesn‚Äôt only cut down on waste, but it also saves money over time. The filter pops out easily, which makes cleaning a breeze. I‚Äôve run it multiple times, and descaling with vinegar and warm water has been simple. However, the basket‚Äôs design means you have to be meticulous about cleaning, or grounds might build up over time, slightly affecting the brew taste.

**Strengths**  
- The warming plate is a lifesaver for someone like me who‚Äôs guilty of forgetting the first cup. It keeps coffee hot without the burnt taste for hours.
- Overheat protection prevents mishaps when water runs low or temperatures spike‚Äîa feature I tested when I distractedly left it brewing too long.  
- Compact footprint makes it apartment-friendly.  
- Simple controls that anyone can master without technical expertise.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The carafe is a bit fiddly when pouring. I‚Äôve encountered occasional spills, especially when trying to pour those last stubborn drops.  
- No programmable timer function, which means early risers like me won‚Äôt wake up to freshly brewed coffee waiting.  
- Build quality feels slightly flimsy, which raises concerns about long-term durability.   

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
Having brewed countless pots now, I can confidently say this machine produces a consistently decent cup of coffee. It‚Äôs no match for high-end espresso machines, but for a classic drip coffee taste, it does the job. I experimented with different grind sizes and even some pre-ground store brands, and the flavor was balanced in most cases. The maximum 12-cup capacity is great for family brunches, but its consistency shines most when brewing smaller portions like 4-6 cups.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this coffee maker to something like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker, the Amazon Basics model is undeniably simpler in features. The Mr. Coffee alternative offers advanced settings like brew delay, which I sometimes miss with this model. However, the lightweight design and overheat protection of the Amazon machine make it better suited for those who prefer straightforward functionality over extra features. Machines like the Ninja CE201 hold their ground with customizable brew strengths, but their higher price range might deter budget-conscious buyers.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering its performance relative to the price point, this coffee maker offers commendable value. While it doesn‚Äôt pack premium features, it delivers solid reliability. In a crowded coffee maker market, investing in a practical, budget-friendly product like this can make sense for students, casual coffee drinkers, or those furnishing a small office. It‚Äôs all about knowing your needs and aligning expectations.

My family and I went to see Dear England at the theatre on 12th April, as a birthday gift to my mum. I‚Äôm not much of a theatreman myself but I enjoyed it - some fun callbacks to England times gone by, some gutting moments relived, and some solid National Theatre acting.¬†

What majorly fucked me off though were the details, or indeed lack of. Some of the ‚Äòplayers‚Äô were wearing that physio tape you get these days - Rashford had a bright blue strip of tape visibly poking out beneath his shorts around his hamstring and knee area, for example. Props to the wardrobe department here, that‚Äôs a lovely bit of attention to detail.¬†

But any credit I had been willing to give to the wardrobe team was swiftly cancelled when I saw the players‚Äô footwear. All, and I mean all the players, were wearing the same pair of nondescript, brandless, all black gym trainers. It was so distracting to have these 11 men in full England kit, with hair styled like the real players, accents mimicked, facial hair copied, and shin pads in - all that, to put them **all** in the same plain black trainer. 

Surely it‚Äôd have made more sense to have them wear the boots from the particular brand each player has a brand deal with? Kane in his sketchers (perhaps Nike in his earlier England days), Bellingham in his Adidas and so on.¬†

At first I thought this was a branding issue - but no. In the show, products from Nike, Umbro, Adidas, and the coffee chain Gail‚Äôs are all on display at some point. So it can‚Äôt be that.

Then I thought maybe it was a noise issue - perhaps the plastic moulded sole of indoor/4G football boots would squeak on stage? But it feels like that‚Äôd be such an easy solve too, just wear them a bit, get them a bit scuffed, and the squeak eases.¬†

My family all really enjoyed the show, and didn‚Äôt even notice the clear issue on display. They reckon I‚Äôm the pedant here - have the panel seen the show, what do you all think?¬†",5,1745505511.0,footballcliches,7,0.86,False

**Why This Pick?**

I‚Äôm sorry, but Memphis has yet to show anyone why they belong in the playoffs. Oklahoma City won Game 1 by 51 points and Game 2 by 19 points ‚Äì the Grizzlies are undoubtedly outgunned, and yet somehow, the spread for the Thunder just keeps getting smaller on these encounters (lol). Perhaps sportsbook thinks the Grizzlies will have an easier time with OKC on their own turf? The last two encounters these teams had in Memphis saw the Thunder win by at least 17 points, so I‚Äôm not biting. I‚Äôll take the tried and true Oklahoma City Thunder to cover tonight, friends.

Info regarding Materials:

* I have broken down Junk (Leather, Steel, Asbestos, Flux, etc.) in large quantities.
* I have most Chems (Psycho, Med, Calmex, etc), Serums and Healing Items (Stimpaks, Rad-X, etc.) in decent to large quantities, EXCEPT Formula P (forn Pin-Pointer's) and X-Cell (for Unyielding). 
* I have most Bobbleheads in small to decent quantities, so generally no need for it. Maybe the occasional one, when I'm running low on certain, uncommon ones.
* Specific Junk (like Floater Pus Sacs) I will need to craft mods, as I don't keep those.
* I have small to decent amounts of most food items on hand. At some point, if someone orders 10x + Powered mods, I will need additional Canned Coffee to craft. Same goes for VATS Optimized (needs Sugar).

Info regarding ""Funky Offers"":

* I'm mostly looking to trade for Leader BBH; will consider other BBH or Magazines.
* If you have old Tradelists with tradeable gear, I'd happily take a look, as I'm still trying to complete some Armor  Sets and Weapon collections the old fashioned way.
* Also looking for Glowing Jackalope/Abe/Bigfoot Masks, so if you happen to have one flying around that you don't need and want a gigantic order of Box Mods for it, let me know.
* Would appreciate orders of 100+ Leaders, but will also entertain single mod orders.

Bridgerton gives us sweeping declarations of love, steamy tension, emotional monologues and romantic moments but there‚Äôs a noticeable absence of those small, thoughtful acts that speak volumes without saying a word. The kind of gestures that show love not just as passion, but as deep, intentional care. 

It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything grand.

These aren‚Äôt plot-driving events; they‚Äôre emotional anchors. And Bridgerton, despite all its opulence, seems to skip them.

[The Sioux Falls Spring Parade of Apartments](https://lloydcompanies.com/apartments/parade-of-apartments/), hosted by the team at 334-RENT, will be held April 26 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.  
‚ÄúWhether you are looking for an apartment, townhome, a downtown loft or a single-family home ‚Äì we have it all! That‚Äôs one of the things that makes our parade unique ‚Äì we truly have something for everyone,‚Äù said¬†[Nikki Johnsen](https://lloydcompanies.com/team-member/nikki-johnsen/), experience manager for Lloyd Property Management and a broker associate.

Historically, the Spring Parade of Apartments is ‚Äúa very busy day for us,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúPeople are looking to move in the spring, so touring during the parade makes process the easy for our guests ‚Äì they can tour as many properties as they want in one day with no appointment necessary.‚Äù  
Here‚Äôs just a snapshot of the properties waiting for you to tour ‚Äì and maybe move in.

**On The East Side**

The Parade of Apartments offers a wide variety of east-side options, all within a quick drive of each other making it a great place to stop during an event like this.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd suggest you don‚Äôt miss the¬†[Rowe Platinum](https://www.theroweon57.com/), which is the newest phase at the Rowe on 57th,‚Äù Johnsen said. ‚ÄúIt features upgraded finishes and high ceilings in a prime location near 57th and Bahnson.‚Äù  
**On The West Side**

[The Boundary](https://www.theboundarysf.com/)¬†is one of many properties ready to welcome you on the west side during the Parade of Apartments, located near Benson and Marion roads.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find the best of both worlds here ‚Äì both apartments and our newest floor plan, a flat-style design that includes a private entrance and a garage right out your front door,‚Äù Johnsen said. ‚ÄúThe two-story clubhouse is a popular feature for the community, and you‚Äôll easily see why.‚Äù  
**To The South**

[The Overture](https://www.theoverturesf.com/)¬†offers a unique community in south-central Sioux Falls which includes studio through three-bedrooms with a fun amenity package at 69th Street and Cliff Avenue.

‚ÄúSome of these have a lofted design so you get a downtown feel but in a great south Sioux Falls location within an easy walk for coffee, dining, ice cream and lots of convenient services,‚Äù Johnsen said.  
**Downtown Living**

The Parade of Apartments coincides with the¬†[Downtown Loft Tour](https://dtsf.com/event/downtown-sioux-falls-spring-loft-tour-2025/), which Lloyd is co-sponsoring from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Among the many properties featured there is the¬†[One2](https://www.one2sf.com/)¬†on the south end of downtown.

‚ÄúWe offered a sneak peek of the One2 during the Fall Parade of Apartments in 2024, but we are excited to fully showcase this property this year,‚Äù Johnsen said. ‚ÄúIt offers studio through three-bedroom lofts, underground parking and an elevated courtyard. Plus it‚Äôs located in the heart of downtown Sioux Falls within walking distance of coffee shops, restaurants, shopping and more.‚Äù  
**What To Expect**

During the Parade of Apartments, you can: Tour 20+ communities without scheduling a tour, take a guided tour or choose a self-show option, take an online or virtual tour with Facebook live tours or watch a virtual tours using the links¬†[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTkxAcw8peUHgcvrtZa1vndKl1KA8jDgH), and ask questions of the on-site teams and leasing specialists.

I know a lot of people (myself included) feel anxious about posting or replying online. It‚Äôs so easy to get caught in the cycle of writing a comment or a post, and then second-guessing it or just deleting it altogether. If that sounds familiar, there‚Äôs a tool I found that can help with all of this.

It automates some of the stuff you‚Äôd normally get stuck on, like replying to posts/messages or even creating your own content. The cool part is that it still lets you keep your own voice, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre outsourcing your social media entirely.

**Some Features:**  
Create posts or reply to threads

Respond to DMs automatically

You can add some subtle marketing if you need it (without it feeling spammy)

It lets you set things up so you can emphasize or avoid certain topics

Works with X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit

If you‚Äôre someone who wants to stay active online but feels like social media is a bit much sometimes, this tool could save you a ton of time and reduce that anxiety. I tried it, and it‚Äôs honestly been a game-changer in helping me feel more confident about being present online.

It‚Äôs also really affordable, around the price of a coffee, and there‚Äôs a 3-day free trial if you want to give it a shot.

Anyway, just thought I‚Äôd share in case anyone else struggles with this kind of thing! Would love to know if anyone has tried something similar or has tips for feeling more confident online",1,1745504794.0,u_ObjectiveTeary,0,1.0,False

**Dan ‚Äì POV**

As I sat in the conference room, the lights low and the ship humming quietly around me, I thought back over the day.

Nixten, becoming a Willholder.

Sparring with him in one of the new suits.

Seeing Ren sync live for the first time.

Yeah. It‚Äôd been a day.

A weird, chaotic, exhausting day. But a good one.

I leaned back in the chair, staring at the ceiling with a faint smile.

‚ÄúIf only I had a cup of coffee right now,‚Äù I muttered, ‚ÄúI might actually call this a good day.‚Äù

The door hissed open, and Zixder walked in, holding a stack of documents under one arm.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I called out, giving him a casual wave.



Zixder gave a nod and dropped the stack onto the table with a soft *thud*. ‚ÄúStatus reports. Damage assessments. Supply logs. You know‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs favorite light reading.‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúOh, joy. Can‚Äôt wait to curl up with those tonight.‚Äù

He pulled out a chair across from me and sat down, ears twitching slightly as he scanned the top page. For a second, we were quiet‚Äîjust the gentle hum of the ship around us.

Then he looked up. ‚ÄúWe need to talk about the next move.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, leaning back in my chair. ‚ÄúI figured we‚Äôd get there eventually.‚Äù

Zixder pushed a datapad toward me.



Earlier today, I mentioned we‚Äôd need to send out an FTL probe to try and catch up with the main Moslnoss fleet‚Äîthe last remnants still running.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, leaning back in my chair. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see where we‚Äôre at.‚Äù

‚ÄúZen,‚Äù I called out.

Her avatar appeared at the front of the briefing room.

And this time? It wasn‚Äôt casual Zen. No rabbit hoodie. No side smirk.

This was her full command avatar. Black and red Wing Guard uniform, perfectly crisp, the Zo Squad badge gleaming on her chest.

The moment I saw it, my stomach dropped. One look said it all: **it was bad.**



I let out a slow breath. ‚ÄúAlright, Zen. Hit me. What happened?‚Äù

Without a word, she gestured. The lights dimmed as a star map flickered into existence in the center of the room, showing our local system. Planets, orbital rings, and tagged paths. Red lines marked known Seeker patrol patterns. A blinking blue dot marked **us**‚Äîcurrently floating in the Graveyard, between the third and fourth planet.

‚ÄúAs you know,‚Äù she began, her tone sharp and formal, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here‚Äîcoordinating repairs and regrouping after pulling the Seekers off-course. The we took the time to continue fixing our systems.‚Äù

Zixder nodded. ‚ÄúWe were supposed to have at least nine days of lead time.‚Äù

Zen‚Äôs face didn‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we estimated. But‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll be here in **four**.‚Äù

I sat up. ‚ÄúFour? That‚Äôs not possible. They need time to turn around. They were halfway to the rim.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt have been able to pivot that fast,‚Äù Zen agreed. ‚ÄúBut they did. As soon as our power grid came back online, they performed a hard reversal. No hesitation. No inertia drift. Just a full 180-degree course correction‚Äîstraight back toward us.‚Äù

Zixder growled. ‚ÄúThat makes no sense. They don‚Äôt have engines strong enough to break momentum like that. Not unless‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúUnless they don‚Äôt use engines,‚Äù I said slowly.

Zen gave me a sharp look. ‚ÄúExactly what I‚Äôve been analyzing.‚Äù

She flicked her hand, and a schematic of one of the Seeker drones replaced the star map. The 3D model slowly rotated in the air, highlighting components with glowing markers.

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt fully understand how they work,‚Äù she admitted, ‚Äúbut I think they‚Äôre using monopole magnets in their central core. They‚Äôre not flying in the traditional sense. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ falling.‚Äù

‚ÄúFalling?‚Äù Zixder frowned.

‚ÄúIn the direction of their choice,‚Äù Zen clarified. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt push. They don‚Äôt thrust. They create directional force by altering the local magnetic fields. Like snapping to gravity wells. Except they‚Äôre making the wells themselves.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, tension running down my spine. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they can change direction like that. It‚Äôs not propulsion. It‚Äôs control.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd worse,‚Äù Zen added, her voice darkening, ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt just turn around. They turned around the moment our power came back online.‚Äù

Zixder stiffened. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre tracking our signatures.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr worse,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúThey were waiting.‚Äù



I looked at Zen, the glowing maps still hovering behind her. ‚ÄúSo, Zen‚Ä¶ are we going to make it?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer right away.

‚ÄúLast time we ran the numbers,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúwe estimated at least three more days to get everything ready‚Äîus and the rest of the fleet.‚Äù

Her posture shifted slightly, her voice a little softer now.

‚ÄúThanks to Ren,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no longer handling the load alone. With her taking over half of my processing strain, I‚Äôve been able to double-task the fabrication queues.‚Äù

She flicked her fingers, and a new status window opened. Colored bars and progress tags scrolled across the screen.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pushing hard. Repairs are ahead of schedule. Fabrication lines are running full tilt. We‚Äôre pulling spare parts, plating, and missile cores from the nearby derelict field.‚Äù

Zixder let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gutting the whole zone.‚Äù

Zen nodded. ‚ÄúAnd the mechs‚ÄîBlitzfire and Syren? Full rebuild and refit. They‚Äôll both be operational by tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sorry about that,‚Äù I said, glancing over at Blitzfire on the charts.

Zen gave me a look. ‚ÄúYou know going full burn mode means days in the shop... and a mountain of replacement parts, right?‚Äù



I exhaled‚Äîslow, careful.

It wasn‚Äôt a win yet. But it wasn‚Äôt doom, either.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Then we just might have a chance,‚Äù I said.

Zen gave a faint smile. ‚ÄúWe just might.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh‚Äîand one more thing,‚Äù Zen added, looking around the room.

‚ÄúAs you know, DLFs can process time a *lot* faster than organics. And Ren? She‚Äôs already run through the full handling protocols for a Zo mech. On top of that, she‚Äôs massively upgraded from her old armored doll unit.‚Äù

Zixder blinked. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîwhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Zen confirmed, her tone calm but impressed. ‚ÄúIn the few hours she‚Äôs been aboard, she‚Äôs completed a full crash course on piloting a Zo-class. Her core processing speed, paired with her combat AI origins, gave her a huge advantage.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got another potential Zo pilot now,‚Äù I said.

There was a long pause.

‚ÄúThat fast?‚Äù Zixder muttered.

I nodded. ‚ÄúThat fast.‚Äù

But I didn‚Äôt stop there. I turned to Zen and met her eyes.

‚ÄúJust make sure she knows,‚Äù I said quietly, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not just a weapon we use.‚Äù

Zen held my gaze for a moment, then nodded once.

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ which one‚Äôs Ren piloting?‚Äù I asked.

Zen turned toward me, arms crossed, expression smug. ‚ÄúRains‚Äô old unit.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWait‚Äî*the* Zephyr Shot?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúYep. The sniper frame. The one that can one-shot a dreadnought from across the system.‚Äù

I let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúWith the B.A.G.‚Äù

Zixder raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúBig. Ass. Gun.‚Äù

I explained to him.

She stepped forward, the faintest smirk tugging at her mouth. ‚ÄúThat mech‚Äôs designed for extreme long-range precision‚Äîtotal battlefield control. And at mid-range? Still deadly.‚Äù

I glanced at her. ‚ÄúCompared to her old armored doll body?‚Äù

Zen didn‚Äôt miss a beat. ‚ÄúThis thing outclasses it in *every* way.‚Äù





I slapped my knee, laughing. ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äî*Rains*, who spent *years* trying to claw her way to the top of the pilot charts to prove she could outdo a DLF, and now her mech is in the hands of a DLF!‚Äù

‚ÄúRains?‚Äù Zixder asked, looking puzzled.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, still grinning. ‚ÄúHer full name was *Rains Down Fire*. The second-best pilot we had. And she *never* let anyone forget it.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe ever outranked Zen?‚Äù he asked, curious.

I nodded. ‚ÄúOnce. Barely. For like, three weeks. You‚Äôd have thought she won the galaxy. She even had a custom jacket made.‚Äù

Zen groaned. ‚ÄúI *remember* that jacket.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúAnd now? Her prized mech? Piloted by someone who wasn‚Äôt even on the board yesterday.‚Äù

Zen just smirked. ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs funny like that.‚Äù



Yup,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe was always gunning for my spot too, but she never quite made it.‚Äù

I turned. ‚ÄúHey, Zen‚Äîyou still have the old rankings?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I do,‚Äù she said, and with a flick of her hand, a holo display lit up in front of us.

**Top 5 Zo Pilots**

**1. Chain dog** ‚Äì 12,525 points

**2. Rains Down Fire** ‚Äì 11,948 points

**3. Zeneth32** ‚Äì 10,977 points

**4. Rax Up-Kills** ‚Äì 9,738 points

**5. Loon** ‚Äì 8,263 points

I stared at the list. A rush of old memories hit me like a wave.

‚ÄúMan,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúFeels like another lifetime.‚Äù

Zen‚Äôs voice was softer now. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because it was.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I added with a smirk, ‚ÄúLoon would‚Äôve ranked higher if he didn‚Äôt crash his mech every three missions.‚Äù

Zen grunted. ‚ÄúStill impressive he made it to the top five at all.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, hands behind my head. ‚ÄúAlright. That leaves us with two goals.‚Äù

Everyone in the room looked up.

‚ÄúOne: get that FTL probe out of the system so we can send help to the main bulk of the Moslnoss fleet.‚Äù

I held up a second finger.

‚ÄúAnd two: try really, really hard not to die when the main Seeker force shows up knocking.‚Äù

Silence.

Then Zen‚Äôs avatar, deadpan: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a solid plan. Thorough. Inspirational.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, smirking, ‚ÄúI work with what I‚Äôve got.‚Äù





Okay, all jokes aside‚Ä¶‚Äù I leaned forward, eyes narrowing at the system map as it popped back up. ‚ÄúWe need to figure out *how* we‚Äôre going to pull this off.‚Äù

The room quieted, all eyes on the floating projection.

I stared at it the way I always do‚Äîlike it was a real-time strategy game. Gridlines. Unit paths. Terrain advantages. I scanned the planets, letting my mind chew on the possibilities until something clicked.

My eyes landed on the fifth planet‚Äîthe biggest one in the system.

‚ÄúWait a second‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered, pointing. ‚ÄúZen, earlier you said the Seekers use mono-pole magnetics to move, right? That they don‚Äôt fly‚Äîthey *fall*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, cocking her head. ‚ÄúThey fall in the direction they choose.‚Äù

I kept my gaze on the fifth planet, something sparking in my head.

‚ÄúSo what happens,‚Äù I asked slowly, ‚Äúif there‚Äôs a *bigger* magnet nearby?‚Äù

She followed my line of sight to the massive planet‚Ä¶ and then her eyes lit up.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

A grin crept onto her face. ‚ÄúIf they get too close‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThey fall,‚Äù I finished. ‚ÄúHard.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat means there‚Äôs a safe zone,‚Äù I said, tapping the display. ‚ÄúAssuming you don‚Äôt mind all the radiation a planet that big puts out.‚Äù

‚ÄúZen,‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúPull up the planet to the center of the table.‚Äù

Her avatar nodded, and the holographic map shifted‚Äîzooming in until the massive fifth planet dominated the center display.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Ä¶‚Äù she murmured, running calculations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about ten percent larger than Jupiter. Constant storms. Massive magnetic interference. And radiation levels that would fry most unshielded systems.‚Äù

Zixder blinked at the size of it. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ are you seriously saying the *Revanessa* can survive diving into a gas giant?‚Äù

‚ÄúKind of,‚Äù I said, scratching the back of my head. ‚ÄúShe can survive going *about* twenty miles into the upper gas layers before it gets too dangerous.‚Äù

Zen nodded. ‚ÄúCorrect. Twenty miles in is the limit. Beyond that, gravity becomes too strong and we won‚Äôt be able to climb back out. The shielding can protect us at that depth‚Äîbut none of the smaller ships will survive it. Not without serious reinforcement.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù I looked back at the map. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a magnet the size of a god, and a ship just tough enough to dip its toes in and not die.‚Äù

Zixder folded his arms, ears twitching. ‚ÄúLet me guess‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre gonna hide there.‚Äù

I grinned.

‚ÄúNot just hide. We‚Äôre gonna make them chase us in.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo here‚Äôs the plan,‚Äù I said, tapping the edge of the holo-map.

‚ÄúWe give some of our FTL probes to the Moslnoss ships‚Äîget them positioned to launch once they‚Äôre in pursuit range. Meanwhile, *we* draw the Seekers to us. Hard.‚Äù

I pointed to the gap between the third and fourth planets.

‚ÄúWe pull as much heat as we can‚Äîjust enough to punch a hole wide enough for the rest of the fleet to slip past while the Seekers are focused on tearing us apart. Then, once we‚Äôve got their attention‚Ä¶‚Äù

I flicked my eyes to the gas giant.

‚ÄúWe do a fighting retreat straight into that monster. The Revanessa dips in just enough to survive. The smaller ships stay above, close but not too close. If they follow us in, their momentum becomes their enemy. If they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we buy enough time for everyone else to get out.‚Äù

I paused.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs insane. But it might be our best shot.‚Äù

I looked around the room.

‚ÄúIf anyone‚Äôs got a better idea‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù



And you‚Äôre sure this ship can handle it?‚Äù Zixder asked, arms crossed, eyes locked on the swirling gas giant projected on the table.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù I leaned back slightly. ‚ÄúIt *did* start as a gas collector. The Revanessa was designed to dive into atmospheres like that, back when she was a deep-harvest vessel.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúAnd hey‚Äîwe do need to restock some of those gases for fuel and life support. So we‚Äôd be killing two birds with one extremely terrifying plunge.‚Äù

Zen nodded, her projection flickering with approval. ‚ÄúThe outer layers are survivable for this ship. But everything will need to be locked down tight. One breach, and we‚Äôre toast.‚Äù

Zixder let out a slow breath, tail flicking once. ‚ÄúGreat. So our plan is to bait a death fleet, make them chase us into a floating apocalypse, and hope our old ship remembers how to breathe gas.‚Äù

I grinned. ‚ÄúPretty much.‚Äù



‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said, scanning the room, ‚Äúif anyone doesn‚Äôt want to go through with this, I‚Äôm sure the mice wouldn‚Äôt mind giving you a ride out. We can arrange an escort. Nobody‚Äôs being forced into this.‚Äù

Zixder looked at me, firm and steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the captain of this ship,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere it goes‚ÄîI go too.‚Äù

I gave him a slow nod. ‚ÄúThe offer still stands,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you change your mind later, no shame in it.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo, Zen,‚Äù I said, glancing up at her avatar, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing the rest of the crew‚Äôs listening in?‚Äù

She chuckled. ‚ÄúLike kids with glasses to the door,‚Äù she said, already pulling up the comms log. ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre tuned in‚Äîand caught red-handed.‚Äù

Messages started flooding in.

**Kale:** *‚ÄúIs it bad that I‚Äôm excited? Like, it‚Äôs chaos, but I love it. I‚Äôve always wanted to see what it‚Äôd be like inside a gas giant.‚Äù*

**Doc:** *‚ÄúWarning: Radiating heat and magnetic pressure will be lethal to most organic lifeforms. Just something to keep in mind before we start joyriding through Jupiter 2.0.‚Äù*

**Nixten:** *‚ÄúI just became a Willholder, and now I‚Äôm gonna die immediately afterward?! Great. Perfect. Love that.‚Äù*

**Callie:** ‚ÄúWell, if we‚Äôre going out, we better look good doing it. I‚Äôm already prepping emergency kits. No one panics on my watch.‚Äù

**Sires:** Why did I sign up for this crew‚Ä¶? Well‚Äîno use complaining now.‚Äù

**Nellya:**¬†¬†‚ÄúOkay, if we‚Äôre doing this‚Ä¶ I want all of you to know‚ÄîI‚Äôm sticking with this pack. No matter what.‚Äù

**Ren:** ‚ÄúCan I request a heat shield made of actual common sense? No? Okay, worth a shot.‚Äù

Zen just smiled, her avatar flickering slightly as she scrolled through the chaos.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre nervous. But they‚Äôre still with us.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, watching the messages scroll by, one after another‚Äîsarcastic, heartfelt, ridiculous, and real.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still with us.‚Äù



‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúA plan is coming together.‚Äù

Hey Mom, Dad‚Äî And, uh, hello to my future wife and hypothetical kids (if you‚Äôre digging through old transmissions one day)!

Just wanted to let you all know I made it up here safe. Pisistratus Station is‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúindustrial chic.‚Äù My habitation cell‚Äôs about the size of my old freshman dorm‚Äîminus the window, minus the door handle, and plus a constant low hum I haven‚Äôt quite figured out yet. Still, it‚Äôs home for now, and I can't complain.

Before we docked, I got a glimpse of the platform. I had no idea how massive it would be. The whole base is built into this rotating ring system‚Äîlike a wheel half-buried in the dark side of the moon. They said it turns at a fixed rate to create a centrifugal force that simulates Earth‚Äôs gravity. You can‚Äôt feel the rotation from inside, but knowing it's happening gives you this weird sense of motion in the back of your brain. The size of the platform blew me away‚Äîit must be at least a kilometer wide, maybe more. They didn‚Äôt really cover *that* in the training videos. It‚Äôs like living in a giant, quiet machine.

Sorry for the short notice on the departure. Once the company pushed us through our specialization certs, things moved *fast*. One day you‚Äôre learning how to realign hydraulic lock seals in VR, and the next you‚Äôre vacuum-sealed into a shuttle bound for the far side of the Moon. They gave us a week‚Äîenough time to pack a duffel, sign a few papers, and say goodbye without thinking too hard.

Don‚Äôt worry though‚ÄîI'll make sure to snag some moonrocks for everyone. Maybe even some deeper core samples if I get in good with the miners. Some of them are already swapping stories about weird strata shifts and mineral anomalies‚Äîjust harmless tall tales, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôve got orientation briefings in the morning‚Äîstation safety, maintenance protocols, door calibration standards. Nothing too wild. I‚Äôll send more when I get a better lay of the place.

Love you all. Tell the dog I miss him.

Alrighty‚Äîhope everyone‚Äôs cozy back home, tucked in, maybe sipping coffee or watching something dumb on TV. Up here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still night. Technically.

I found out that the far side of the Moon doesn‚Äôt really *do* mornings. When we docked, they told us it was ‚Äúnight‚Äù. Turns out, we‚Äôve got another ten days of darkness to go. Fourteen days of night. Fourteen of daylight. Like a celestial switch.

And the telescope? Yeah, you can forget that‚Äîthis side of the Moon never faces Earth. Not even a shimmer. Something to do with the rotation rate of the Earth and Moon mixed with their orbits. It‚Äôs just black sky and stars out there. Honestly, it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also feels‚Ä¶ heavy. Like the whole sky‚Äôs pressing in.

Anyway, I promised you updates, so here we go. Today‚Äôs briefing was actually kind of awesome. We learned why the station‚Äôs named *Pisistratus*. He was some old-school Athenian leader‚Äîbenevolent, they said. Supposedly ushered in a golden age, redistributed land from the elites to the common people, built up the arts and the temples.

I guess that‚Äôs why so many of us are up here. Not just scientists, not just astronauts‚Äînormal people. Mechanics, janitors, miners. I might be the only one in my habitation sector with a degree, and it doesn‚Äôt even matter. That‚Äôs kind of the magic of this place‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs useful. Everyone has a job.

The miners especially‚Äîrough folks, but some of the highest-paid up here. They say the core‚Äôs rich with rare isotopes. Stuff you can‚Äôt even find in Earth‚Äôs crust anymore. I heard a guy say one of the new mines has veins that *pulse*‚Äîprobably just a figure of speech. Right?

I got my assignment! I‚Äôll be stationed near the western airlocks, just off the corridor leading to Mine 7B. It‚Äôs a quieter sector‚Äîlower traffic. I monitor a bank of cameras, run diagnostics, cycle door tests. Six doors, one tech, one long hallway.

Honestly? I‚Äôm excited. There‚Äôs something kind of peaceful about it out there. Real quiet.

Anyway, more tomorrow. Love you guys.

Hey guys. Sorry I didn‚Äôt get a message out yesterday‚Äîit was‚Ä¶ kind of a whirlwind. Spent most of the day clearing out my little office nook near the West Wing airlocks.

You know, I figured everything up here would be sleek, futuristic, that kind of thing. But honestly? Some of my equipment feels like it belongs in a museum. My camera monitors are chunky old CRT-style boxes‚Äîno touchscreens, no fancy heads-up displays. The feeds are weirdly grainy too, with this low hum in the background. Like they‚Äôre running off‚Ä¶ older tech, I guess. I even had to dust some of them off.

Controls are tactile‚Äîclunky switches, big metal toggles. Kind of retro, which would be charming if there weren‚Äôt serious cases where a door could cycle improperly, and all of our oxygen is sucked out.

Yesterday I had to do a servo repair on Door 3. Nothing too wild, but it was different from what the crash course taught us. Wiring was off. Slightly older schematic. Still‚Äîpressurized doors are pressurized doors, right?

Today was quieter. Almost peaceful. I considered walking back to my habitation cell early and writing this, but I stayed in the office and fiddled with the terminal a bit.

Good news‚ÄîI got one of the IT guys, Ethan, to help me clean up the interface. He‚Äôs only been here a couple months longer than me, but he‚Äôs sharp. Showed me a bunch of back-end menus, some override protocols I didn‚Äôt know I had access to. Emergency lockdowns, remote seals‚Äîsome of it felt... above my clearance, if I‚Äôm being honest.

He said it‚Äôs standard now, that they updated things a while back. But the way he said ‚Äúupdated‚Äù was weird. Like the system's been layered over *something older*.

Honestly, the computers themselves run pretty quick. Maybe they‚Äôve just got new guts inside old shells. Kind of getting the feeling that it‚Äôs how it is with this whole station, now that I think about it.

On a lighter note‚Äîcafeteria absolutely *slapped* today. Real apple pie. Not rehydrated, not vacuum-sealed‚Äîactual, warm, fragrant pie. I was sitting there wondering if that technically makes it a moonpie up here. Or‚Ä¶ maybe a moonpie up here would just be called a pie and the ones back home are the frauds? Got caught in that loop for a while.

Anyway, I‚Äôm clocking out soon. Crew from Mine 7B‚Äôs scheduled to return tomorrow. I‚Äôll be on door control‚Äîopen, cycle, seal. Easy stuff.

Gotta stay rested, even if all I‚Äôm doing is pushing buttons. Love you guys always.

Okay. Today was cool, but I have some questions.

The mining crew came back a little early‚Äînot an issue. The outer door camera showed them pulling up in the large buggy with a bag about the size of me, probably stuffed with ore and rare minerals. It looked‚Ä¶ uncanny, the way they hopped toward the airlock platform with the bag drifting behind the guy carrying it. Like it was deadweight, but not *heavy*.

They keyed in the activation code, then radioed the keyphrase to my room, and I hit the confirmation. The base‚Äôs announcement system echoed through the halls, alerting everyone to the gravity shift. The low hum of the station‚Äôs rotation slowed until it stopped, locking into position with the platform.

Two of the miners lifted the bag as they entered. Cycling began‚Äîoxygen restored, pressure stabilized. Then centrifugal rotation spun back up. Gravity settled.

That‚Äôs when one of the miners lost his grip.

His side of the bag dropped to the floor with a force I could *feel* through the feed. There‚Äôs no sound on the cameras, but I swear I heard the thud in my chest. A dark liquid sprayed out across his boots and pooled fast.

It was thick. Not hydraulic fluid. Not oil. Something else.

Within seconds, Research techs in yellow badges were sprinting past my hallway viewport with a cart. I glanced back to the monitor just in time to see them load the bag‚Äîquick, methodical. Way too smooth to be their first time.

I stood to get a better look as they wheeled it past my window. Down the hall. Out of sight.

No one said a word about it. Not during check-in. Not in the logs.

I know it‚Äôs probably nothing. Ore can leak, right?

I hope nothing poisonous was in the liquid that got on the floor, but they cleaned it up pretty quickly, so I‚Äôm sure it's safe.

Anyway‚Äîtonight I swapped out my bedding and noticed a huge black, maybe brownish, stain on the mattress underneath. The look of it reminded me of the leak from the bag.

So, three things:My bed‚Äôs been used and the stain looks pretty fuckin old. Two‚Äîthe mining crews are supposed to work in teams of six. Only three came in with that bag. And three‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt really thought about it until now, but‚Ä¶ why do they need both a code *and* a keyphrase just for me to let them in?

Why lock a door that tightly unless there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre trying to keep out?

Time to sleep before I overthink it. This kind of stuff is above my pay grade. Love you.

So‚Ä¶ two more of the crew came back today?

They didn‚Äôt have a vehicle. I watched them almost robotically leap across the lunarscape toward the keypad podium. No buggy, no extra gear. Just the two of them, silhouetted against the black horizon.

They keyed in the code and gave the keyphrase over the radio‚Äîquiet, raspy, almost like their comms were breaking up. I hit the confirmation key.

The announcement sounded, gravity slowed, oxygen cycled, they came in.

Fifteen minutes later, my supervisor shows up. Doesn‚Äôt knock, doesn‚Äôt greet me‚Äîjust asks why I stopped the centrifuge.

I told him about the crew, the radio call, the docking procedure. He just‚Ä¶ stared at me. Like I‚Äôd said something wrong. Then turned around and walked out before I could even ask.

I watched him cross the corridor outside my window at a brisk, determined pace, speaking into his radio the whole way.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI was worried. Still am. But no one‚Äôs said anything. Not to me, anyway.

It‚Äôs been a few hours now, and we just entered a lockdown drill.

Except they *really* stressed that we treat it like the real thing.

Doors sealed, motion lights off, auxiliary power only. No one in or out.

Something about the phrasing‚Äîthe tone‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just a drill. It felt more like a warning.

The kind where they don‚Äôt want to say what they‚Äôre actually preparing for.

Gonna lie down and wait it out.

**>>ENTRY SIX<<**

¬†**>>Uplink Secure. Lag 3.9s** 

**>>PERSONAL LOG: LEON R.**



I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.

Mom, Dad‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared.

It‚Äôs been about three weeks since my last log. I had to wait. I had to survive.

I used the 14 days of light. That‚Äôs the only time it‚Äôs safe to move around.

They don‚Äôt come out as much when the sunlight hits the exterior corridors. I think the windows‚Äîthose thick, curved panes‚Äîact like traps.

They just stop and stare, motionless, when the beams catch them.

But the inner corridors? The ones without windows?

No light reaches there.

There‚Äôs no stopping them there.

The bigger rooms‚Äîthe ones with skylights‚Äîwere safer.

For a time.

I managed to reach Ethan from IT on the short-range comms link in my office. A few times.

While he was still alive‚Ä¶

The last time we spoke, he said he‚Äôd been sleeping in the hydroponics atrium during the lightshift. That dome gets full sun exposure during the light days.

It kept him safe from the things.

We didn‚Äôt talk often, but early on, he told me enough to make some guesses.

The team leads. The high-clearance personnel.

They‚Äôre not on base anymore.

I remember it now‚Äîclear as day.

The night of the lockdown, I was already in bed when the alert came through: **Centrifugal Halt ‚Äì Platform Synchronization Inbound.**

I thought it was just another drill. I waited for the hum to return. For the soft sway of gravity to resume.

But it never came back.

Ethan told me later that week. He saw it‚Äîthrough a corridor window after he‚Äôd cracked open his cell door.

The Emergency Return shuttle lifted off from the south platform.

While we were still in full stop.

They left us here.

*All of us.*

Before I knew any of that, I‚Äôd already floated back to my office‚Äîhalf an hour of low-G silence behind me. Something felt wrong, even though I hadn‚Äôt yet realized the shuttle had left.

I keyed in my credentials. Accessed the override protocols.

I started by checking why the centrifuge hadn‚Äôt restarted. Why the platform hadn‚Äôt cycled.

But then I saw it.

The south platform wasn‚Äôt the only door with an administrator override.

The research corridors glowed orange‚Äîpathing active. Three internal doors were blinking red.

Not cycled.

Locked shut.

The only way to clear an administrator override is with a full facility reset.

That would cycle every exterior door. Re-engage gravity. And unlock every single pressurized passage across the station.

I didn‚Äôt do it.

But someone else did.

Another door tech, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôm not responsible for this.

I understood what it meant when I saw the research facility manually locked down.

I understood.

Something was in the station that we couldn‚Äôt let spread.

When all of the doors unlocked, they clambered out.

Shambling *humanthings*.

I‚Äôve seen them in person now.

Incomprehensibly grotesque.

Rotted. Necrotic. Elongated joints, with hanging jaws and stringy hair.

They move like they‚Äôre searching.

Like they‚Äôre remembering.

I know they‚Äôre remembering.

Because Ethan still comes to the locked door at the end of corridor R

‚Ä¶and stares through the camera.

Straight at me. I can see his mouth moving, rambling, but I won‚Äôt go near the door.

I have to go for now.

Without many of the engineers, the station's gone into auto-backup mode. A few generators are about to cycle on in a couple minutes.

And even though I‚Äôve locked off the corridors between my cell and my office‚Ä¶ When that noise kicks up, they get agitated.

I‚Äôve got a little crawlspace behind a panel in the office I hide in, in case one of them manages to open a door again.

Pray.

 I wasn‚Äôt supposed to find this. But I did.

For days now, I‚Äôve been unlocking and relocking the admin corridors‚Äîwatching, waiting. The human things, they don‚Äôt remember their paths. They wander, bumping into walls or sealed doors, some drifting into new hallways before I shut them off. There‚Äôs one that drags a broken leg behind it, like a sack of tools. I timed its circuit through Sector D. When it was far enough down the hall, I made my move.

The door to Administrator Roan‚Äôs office was locked with a four-tier system‚Äîno easy bypass. I‚Äôve cracked two before‚Äîmaintenance overrides buried in the diagnostic logs. But this one‚Ä¶ it had a special key gate.

I thought I was screwed. Then I remembered something: Roan‚Äôs quarters.

I wasn‚Äôt shocked to find a few administrators left behind. The station layout, combined with the timing of the outbreak and subsequent evacuation, made it feel inevitable. What I didn‚Äôt expect was what I found in Roan‚Äôs quarters.

Her facility suit lay discarded on the floor, the remains of her body still inside, like she‚Äôd been eaten from the inside out. The suit‚Äôs fabric clung to her like a half-formed cocoon, and what was left of her‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. Soft tissue, sloshing in my hands. I had to pry her keycard free from the inner lining of the forearm. It took a few minutes‚Äîand a lot of gagging‚Äîbut I got it.

When I made it back to the office and slotted the card into the master terminal, I thought it was all over. I was wrong.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A system-wide communications lockdown had been enacted during the final centrifuge cycle, just before the Emergency Return shuttle launched. Personal comms had been rerouted. Every outgoing message from standard personnel accounts was flagged as ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù and dumped into a queue.

They‚Äôre all still here.

Every message. Every cry for help.

Not just mine. Hundreds of them.

Audio. Video. Text logs. Some people were still recording even after the power started to fail in their sections.

Some of the messages are just static and sobbing. Others... Some of them talk about things that don‚Äôt make sense. Worse than what I‚Äôve seen.

There are names I don‚Äôt recognize. One man‚Äîsecurity, I think‚Äîkept saying he heard them whispering in the walls. That they knew his name. And that they remembered him.

I opened my own log queue. It was there. Everything I‚Äôve said to you. None of it ever left Pisistratus Station.

I sat there for a long time. Listening. To everyone. To no one.

There‚Äôs a backup transmission command on Roan‚Äôs computer. A hardline. The problem is, I have a list of thousands of servers to send transmissions to. I can manually clear the queue of each flagged log, but I don‚Äôt know which servers to send them to.

I think I have no choice but to send everything out. I‚Äôm hoping for help. I‚Äôm unable to establish a direct line to Earth‚Äîevery company line seems halted. I believe we were told that each transmission takes a week to reach Earth.

So, tomorrow, I‚Äôll send everything out. Today, I‚Äôll reroute some doors, maybe raid the cafeteria again. I should be good for months if I stay quiet.

I love you, Mom. Dad. I‚Äôll be home soon. ‚Äì Leon

 Lots of us in gold are pricing in a dip as money starts to flow in from the ""printers"" at the US Dept of printing and engraving. How much are the old double eagles drop in value when gold price drops?

I'm only asking because I bought my first St. Gaudens, something I've been saving and waiting to do for 2 years now (unfortunately gold price is high)--I want a rationale to hold longer rather than flip right now when gold is ""hot"" and perhaps pick it up again after the price drops.

However, my initial research is telling me that my purchase price, while high--I should expect the double eagle to continue to grow in value. I also noticed that even as gold price drops, this coin seems to hold value and even appreciate in more bearish markets.

What has been your practical experience with this or what do you think?

I believe I can safely hold this coin, ignore gold price and enjoy my coffee. Or, do I get all hot and bothered, use the new price discovery as a flipping platform, and try to sell to buy a better one later?
