‚Äç

**Why This Pick?**

4 of the last 5 meetings between these two squads have comfortably landed below 228.0, friends. In addition, the Hornets were far and away the best in the league at cashing the Under last season. As for the Nets, they had a tough time cracking 110 points for the majority of 2024/25. In my opinion, neither one of these offenses has the chops to reliably clear nearly 230 points, especially not this early in the season! My money‚Äôs on the Under to hit this evening.

1odcs4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1odcs4g/these_recurring_dreams/,These recurring dreams,"This morning, this dream kept pissing me off, that I was about to punch a wall very hard because of it, but I decided to wake up anyway. Here‚Äôs how it went with my dream.

In a dream, at home, I sound like a child version? My parent mentions where are going somewhere and promise we will go there, but every time we are about to, it gets delayed with something, it kept repeating, then when I woke up, then back to sleep, then after 4th time falling back to sleep it kept repeating, I would be having a temper tantrum, trying to break something, maybe growl?, yelling in a higher pitched like the sound of that child voice.

that‚Äôs when it was angering me to punch something, but I decided to get up at 4am, get coffee and all. It‚Äôs so weird to considering I‚Äôm a 27 year old, nothing much going on in my life.

So, this theme, the previous ones, where dreams of a child version of myself, learning we are in a different country, I ask my parents when are we going home? Why we gotta wait an extra week. That week turns to another, then a month. So the same tantrums and panic happens, trying to figure out ways to get back, rob credit cards, my mind suggested me, we attack people in the dream?

This kind of dreams been repeating, I guess since I was a teen, so I really don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, when I wake up, I wake up confused on what is happening, like once I wake up crying, then suddenly I‚Äôm like, what the fuck? What is happening.

So im really entirely unsure, so that‚Äôs why im wondering what are your thoughts?",1,1761149895.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Two months ago, my girlfriend (26) came to visit my city for the first time and to meet my family after we‚Äôd been dating for four months. The situation at home wasn‚Äôt the best even before she came, because my family always puts me in uncomfortable situations. For example, once I asked my mother if she wanted to come with me to run some errands so we could spend some time together and maybe get closer. During that outing, while we were talking, she suddenly mentioned that she needed to buy clothes for a concert of a band I like, a concert she was going to with my sister.

Going back to earlier that year, in January, I had told my sister that this band I love would be coming to our country for the first time, and I asked if she‚Äôd like to go with me. She said no, because she was studying for an exam and didn‚Äôt know where she‚Äôd be, so I understood. But later, in February, my work contract ended, and when I moved back to my mother‚Äôs house, I fell into a bit of depression, I wasn‚Äôt eating, and I barely left my room. Then, that same day I went out with my mother, when we were at the bank and there was a line at the ATM, I told her she could use the same one I was using, but she didn‚Äôt wait and canceled my transaction. I responded a bit harshly because I was already upset about the concert situation and her lack of patience.After that, she stopped talking to me and walked ahead of me. But when we turned a corner, I ended up walking in front of her, and a minute later, when I looked back, she was gone. I called her for 40 minutes, but she wouldn‚Äôt answer. I was on the verge of tears when I went back home, and there she was.

Later, I talked to my mother and sister because I didn‚Äôt want situations like that happening when my girlfriend was there. I didn‚Äôt want her to be in such a toxic environment. So I apologized to them and said that if they had any issues with me, I was sorry and would try to fix whatever bothered them. I also asked them about the concert, and my mother said that since I wasn‚Äôt leaving my room in February, they decided to buy the tickets on their own and then ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to mention it. As for her walking away and leaving me, she said I was ‚Äúpunishing her‚Äù for walking in front of her. I told her that I had called her for 40 minutes because I was worried, if I wanted to punish her, I wouldn‚Äôt have acted like that.

Weeks later, after I had apologized, my girlfriend came to visit. Everything went relatively well until my mother insisted that she meet my brother. So I sent him a message to go for a coffee at a caf√©, and he said he‚Äôd come by the house at 5 the next day. He arrived two hours late, and when he came with his girlfriend, the first thing they said was that they didn‚Äôt speak English. We‚Äôre Spanish, and my girlfriend is Scottish. I told them I could translate, so it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. But they didn‚Äôt say a single word to her for 20 minutes. Instead, they talked to my mother and sister, ignoring us completely, even after I tried to start conversations. Eventually, I took my girlfriend‚Äôs hand and we left. My girlfriend wasn‚Äôt too affected by it, but it made my blood boil to see how they treated us.

A month later, my girlfriend was coming back with her mother to celebrate our birthdays, since our birthdays are a few days apart. I asked my mother if she‚Äôd like to go out for a drink on my birthday, and she agreed, mentioning that my brother wouldn‚Äôt be able to come because of work. I was staying in an apartment that my girlfriend and her mother had rented for the week. A few days later, I told my mother I had reserved a table for five, and that‚Äôs when it all started again. She called me a ‚Äúshameless person‚Äù for not considering my brother and said that if she couldn‚Äôt celebrate with all her children, she wouldn‚Äôt celebrate with any. I tried to fix things, I called my brother (he confirmed he was working that day), even canceled the restaurant reservation to celebrate with a picnic in the park, something my girlfriend and I planned. But then my mother said she didn‚Äôt want to do that either. Tired of everything, I canceled any plans with my family and told them it would be better if I just celebrated with my girlfriend and her mother, so they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry.

When my girlfriend arrived, I went with her, and we spent the week together. But since then, I haven‚Äôt spoken to my mother or sister, even though we live in the same house. I‚Äôm desperately looking for a job to move out. Last week, they went to that concert and left me alone for two days without saying a word beforehand. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing, but I know I need to set boundaries for my own well-being. My father, who‚Äôs divorced from my mother and with whom I have a cordial relationship, says I should apologize and ask for forgiveness, but I really believe I‚Äôve done everything I could to keep things peaceful with them.",2,1761149470.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1odcf2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1odcf2d/lesson_2_relationship_with_food/,Lesson 2: relationship with food,"Hey there, I recieved many dms appreciating my last post. So thought of simplifying everything for you all. 

First of all, green tea, coffee or any other sponsored drink that a dumb dick sells is not going to get your stomach ""snatched"".
The only thing that matters is CALORIES IN AND CALORIES OUT. 

Carbs are not your enemy. Fats are not your enemy. Sugary drinks yeah they might be. 
Dont fear pizza or burger cause that's all they are. Food. Not bad or good food. Just food. 

So why is there fear around foods? Well they are generally higher in calories and are less satiating than say sweet potatoes so people tend to eat those and add other things so feel full. Leading to high calorie consumption. Does it mean that you have to give up your favorite cookies or papa John's Pizza? Heck no. I would rather have my fingers crushed  in a door than quit these bits of happiness from my life. 

The key is moderation. 

We all have our caloric window, in which we can eat absolutely anything we want and still lose weight. The snacks just tend to take a bit more space in that window leading to fear that pizza is bad and chicken breast boiled is good.

You can gain weight even if you eat way too many chicken and rice and lose weight even if you only eat  two burgers and not live a sedentary life. Choice is yours, given you also need fiber and you dont really get that much from those two slices of cabbage. 

Also getting into carbs. Carbs are not your enemy as people make it out to be. 1g of carbs hold 4g of water in your body. 

It's a bit more complex to explain but I'll try to make it simple. Basically if you are used to eating carbs and you switch to keto which is personally awful for me, you'll lose water weight which your body stores. Those massive reduction in weight is not fat. It's just water. That's all. Nothing miraculous in that.

You can gain weight even in keto diet if you go beyond your maintenance level. 

Carbs get the bad rep because people dont understand what happens with the body. 

1. Diet consisting of 1200 calories at maintenance level which has like 250g of protein and some fat and fiber will lead to a steady result on the scale. 

2. If you keep the calories the same and add carbs and reduce protein a bit and fat, it will lead to a massive spike on the scale. 

Now it's understandable how a person can feel that they have been eating the same calories and just started eating carbs and that led to weight gain and now you fear carbs. But understand that carbs are just holding more water making you look fuller too. I am sorry if I was not very clear with this one, i hope you get the idea. 


Also medications which says that side effect is weight gain, isn't making you gain weight by its own unless it's messing with hormones. Generally it's just making you hungrier which leads to you eating more and then you know gaining more weight, so people who deal with those have to be slightly more cautious. Mindful actually.  If I have missed any point I'll edit it in. Good luck ^‚Å†_‚Å†^",1,1761149085.0,beginnerfitness,1,1.0,False

My wife and I recently learned she's being transferred to her company's Warsaw office, and we're excited (and overwhelmed) that we're finally moving to Europe. She visited the city for a couple days earlier this year when it sounded like this might be a possibility, but we're obviously still new and unfamiliar with Warsaw and Poland in general. 

(Editing this section for clarity and to ask questions more directly): So I thought I would post here and see if anyone could provide recommendations. 

* Are there specific neighborhoods we should be looking at?
* What are the best sites/resources for finding apartments? 
* For fun: Cool coffee shops, museums, or good restaurant recommendations?
* Do any expats have advice for us in general? Things you wish you would've known or considered?

Apologies if this is too vague. This is very new to us and we don't know what we don't know, so we're just trying to piece together as much as we can.

About us:

* She's a US/EU dual citizen, but has only ever lived in the US. I am only a US citizen (but would like to become an EU citizen).
* We're in our mid-to-late 30s
* 1 <30 lbs. dog. No kids.
* Single salary. Annual gross: 295.000 PLN.
* I have no immediate plans to work, though I was in tech for 12 years and would be open to it once I'm allowed to. Otherwise, I'm an artist and focus on photography and writing.
* We'll ship over some possessions, but we're selling our house and the vast majority of our belongings in anticipation of the move.
* Looking for a 3-room apartment, ideally with easy access to grocery stores, parks, restaurants, and coffee shops.
* Neither of us are big nightlife people. We don't really go to bars/clubs. We prefer museums, parks, movies, hiking, etc.
* We do not know Polish, but we'd love to learn! I'm starting with an app to get some basics, but I would like to take classes once we arrive.
* We're from Chicago, so we're used to pretty brutal winters. :)

Happy to provide additional clarity. We're looking at this as a new chapter in our life together, and plan to stay in Europe long-term. We're excited to land in Poland.

Appreciate any and all help. Thanks!",3,1761148944.0,warsaw,3,1.0,False

1. Civilians can‚Äôt discern good coffee from awful shots when all the flavorings are added. Or they just like the idea of coffee more than coffee for itself. 

Had more than a few ‚Äúsubpar‚Äù shots by my standards I.e slower/faster than prescribed, they kind I would‚Äôve thrown away, and they still loved it. 

2. Made more drinks in a day than I make for myself over a month. I usually just drink macchiatos so, pouring 15-20 lattes back to back definitely helped me hone my milk texture and pouring skills. So I guess practice makes better ? 

3. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, didn‚Äôt cost a lot to make employees a little happy for the day. And stick it to main office with their hot cocoa bar and sno-cone truck!

It was the restructuring thing. I wasn't shocked. We all saw it coming. They gave me a decent severance. 4 months. So I still have a month of cushion left. Plus unemployment. I'm not going to be homeless tomorrow. But I can't do anything. I just sit here. I wake up, I make coffee. I open LinkedIn. I look at the job postings. And my chest gets so tight I feel like I'm going to throw up. I've been on LinkedIn for 3 months straight.

1odc6u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1odc6u4/am_i_being_selfish_for_keeping_my_own_paycheck/,Am i being selfish for keeping my own paycheck instead of contributing to house bills(as a wife who makes less money than her husband)?,"(Sorry this might be long lol)

So I know this might sound kinda selfish, but I‚Äôm a young wife (21F) and I like having nice, functional things for our home. Things that make life easier or just make me happy. My husband (25M) doesn‚Äôt really think that way ‚Äî he believes a lot of that stuff isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnecessary,‚Äù even when it would genuinely make things better.

For example, I wanted a big floor mirror (around $100 on Amazon) so I can actually see my outfits before leaving the house, since we only have bathroom mirrors. He said it‚Äôs unnecessary and that we don‚Äôt need it.

Then I wanted a Shark vacuum for $300 ‚Äî same thing, ‚Äúnot necessary.‚Äù I ended up buying it myself. Same with a coffee table and some pantry accessories. He told me not to, I bought them anyway because I love them and they make me happy.

When I said I wanted a dining table and chairs, he told me we don‚Äôt need them since we never have guests. I told him we don‚Äôt have guests because we don‚Äôt even have a table and our house is messy ‚Äî mostly because he leaves his stuff everywhere. He‚Äôs a collector and literally has thousands of collectibles all over the place.

For context, I work part-time ‚Äî 3 days a week and make about $600 weekly. He works 4‚Äì6 days a week and makes around $1,000‚Äì$1,800, depending on how much he feels like working. Our jobs are flexible, so I chose to work less so i can be home and do what i can cleaning and also so I can pay my own personal bills (credit cards, phone bill, Affirm/Klarna, etc.).

Now here‚Äôs the problem ‚Äî he wants me to give him half my paycheck ($300 a week) to ‚Äúhelp with bills‚Äù and so he can save up for car insurance, house insurance, property taxes, etc. He said he‚Äôll also be saving $400 a week for that.

But he already makes double what I make, and some weeks he only works 4 days (sometimes not even full days). He just doesn‚Äôt want to wake up early or go in the extra days. Meanwhile, he spends so much on his hobbies ‚Äî reptiles and collectibles.

Like‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll drop $900 in one visit to a reptile store and we go there almost weekly. He easily spends another $200‚Äì$300 each time. Some of his collectibles are $200+ each too. I‚Äôm not saying he shouldn‚Äôt enjoy his hobbies, but it makes no sense to me how my $100 mirror or $300 vacuum is ‚Äúwasteful,‚Äù while his weekly reptile hauls are fine.

And then he tells me I should give him half my check to pay bills. But why should I when he‚Äôs spending hundreds every week on stuff we don‚Äôt need?

He says I‚Äôm selfish for keeping my money and using it for myself when he pays the main bills, groceries, etc. But I still cook, clean (slowly but I do it), take care of the dogs, and work. When he gets to come home from work and relax playing video games while also leaving everything everywhere just for me to pick up later (i mean literally leave things everywhere like a literal child btw) I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that I‚Äôm basically doing free housework and still expected to hand over half my money on top of that.

He argues that he can spend what he wants because ‚Äúhe can afford it,‚Äù and that I shouldn‚Äôt buy expensive things because ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford it.‚Äù But like‚Ä¶ what? That just feels so unfair.

He didn‚Äôt used to be like this ‚Äî before marriage and even in our first year, he loved buying me things and never made me feel bad about what I wanted. I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs changed so much when it comes to money.

So I guess I‚Äôm just asking ‚Äî am I being selfish for wanting to keep my own money and buy things for myself or the house? Or is he being selfish for expecting me to give him half my paycheck while he freely spends on his hobbies?

We‚Äôre otherwise happy together,(we have been married 3 years, together for 7) but money is the one topic that keeps causing fights, and I‚Äôm starting to feel really stuck. üò•

‚ÄúTL;dr‚Äù husband says if im working i should pitch in with bills giving him half my paycheck even though i make less money than him and since i work less i should still take care of the house and clean on my days off but doesnt help out and doesnt want to buy me things i want for OUR house, he only pays for necessities like groceries and food, bills but yet buys himself things that equal more than $800 in one day and says that it ‚Äúisnt‚Äù the same because i have my own money and he is just spending his own money not mine ",3,1761148596.0,marriageadvice,3,1.0,False

Inside, people read silently, with the same pace, the same posture, the same expression‚Ä¶ all uniform, all inevitable. They greeted him with a smile and a nod.

His hat slipped from the table. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù he muttered to the woman next to him, bending to pick it up. His eyes caught her book. Written there, plain and unassuming, were the words:

‚Äú‚Ä¶will buy a red-dotted black dress, a Vict‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked away, returning to his own reading.

Later, during a break, he stepped outside for a walk. The woman had gone, leaving only the echo of her presence. As he sipped coffee, he spotted her down the street, with a red-dotted black dress and Victorian hat.

Bored by the monotony of his thick, repetitive book, an idea struck him: What if I tear the pages?

He began, carefully at first, ripping one page after another. The subtle shuffle of paper drew glances. At first, disapproving. Then, sharper. By the time he had torn half the pages, the readers‚Äô eyes were dark with anger.

I haven't thought about breakfast on Friday, yet, so I have that going for me which is nice I guess? I've been eating 1800-1950 calories per day since April, and have lost about 75lbs in that time. Prior to that I was in a medical weight management program and was on a medically-supervised 800-900 calories per day via meal replacements, and lost about 100lbs from December->April. Even when I was on crazy low calories I didn't have this level of food noise every day.

I've already got all my meals prepped for the next 4 days, and I already have MyFitnessPal loaded up for the next 2 days worth of calories, so I don't really have to think about any of it. But I can't not think about it. It's all I think about. If I'm working I have a constant monologue in the back of my head talking about how good the yogurt bowl I made for my snack is gonna taste because I used some fancy cinnamon and cocoa powder in it today. If I am walking or in the gym after work I am thinking about how I'm gonna prep the veggies for dinner tonight to go along with the protein prep the wife made. Should I stir fry or steam them? What kind of seasonings should I use? Maybe I can stop at the grocery store on the walk back home and pick up some snap peas, that would be pretty good with the broccoli and cabbage! OHhhhhhh, what about breakfast tho? Like, I know it is gonna be protein coffee, but what kind of zero sugar syrup should I put in it? The maple bourbon pecan is a real banger, but caramel pecan has a nice ring to it. Also, I might need to pick up more habaneros for my yogurt bowl tomorrow, I think I only have one left and it is pretty small, they would go great with a granny smith apple and some cinnamon catalina crunch. And I can follow that up with a wild cherry barebell for lunch since I am having a cookies and cream one for lunch today. And dang, should I pick up some potatoes for a starch for dinner tomorrow or should I maybe do some pasta? Once I get that sorted, I should focus on breakfast for Friday.

I am deeply longing for emotional connection & love, not sex. An EQUAL partnership.

A life with a beautiful young woman by my side who won‚Äôt hurt me physically, emotionally, or financially like past partners.

Big into Video Games, RPGs, movies, WWII, reading, photography, shooting, bike riding, urban exploration.

I‚Äôm pretty shy, a little chubby but trying to work out more. I do suffer from Psoriasis but it‚Äôs mostly under control with medication. I hate smoking of tobacco, and usually only drink socially. 420 friendly as long as it isn‚Äôt a total obsession like my ex who stole hundreds from me to buy it.

I love helping others. I admit, I need help with my social skills because of my upbringing, but I'm learning fast.

I‚Äôm only attracted to feminine appearing people. Not looking for anyone over 32 or under 21 unless showing a good level of maturity.

Not looking for long distance, I deeply crave non-sexual physical intimacy & fun activities together.

1odc462,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1odc462/manager_giving_advice_to_someone_struggling_in/,Manager giving advice to someone struggling in early career,"I‚Äôm a young manager working in land use planning for a mid-sized city ‚Äì a lot of work in social situations, highish pressure, bureaucratic culture, reading the room, social cues, technical but qualitative work. 16 or 17 months ago we hired someone as part of a cohort of recent masters grads out of school. I was his boss and soon in, it was kinda clear to me he may be neurodivergent and not well liked by the cohort. He tended to not read the room, communicate with incorrect words and inadvertently offend or turn people off. His work ‚Äì mostly summarizing policy research - was pretty poor in quality, and often needed to be rewritten. He tended, for example, to have lots of spelling mistakes, jump to a conclusion or use archaic words that seemed out of place or included connotations that were not appropriate.

I was kind of an ok manager ‚Äì I did weekly or biweekly checkins because I knew he was struggling. I was also under a lot of pressure and dealing with my own unrelated bullying situation so I had little depth to my ability to mentor. My personal style as a manager isn‚Äôt so great as I‚Äôm a bit of a people-pleaser. He wasn‚Äôt really doing so great and I was kinda coddling him and giving him low-stakes work, and generally saying he was doing ok. I wouldn‚Äôt for example delegate interacting with community members to him because I was worried he would say the wrong thing or jump to an inappropriate conclusion. The work I assigned to others in the cohort was obviously higher complexity. We had to have some disciplinary talks about something offensive he said on a group chat, and for falling asleep at his desk.

¬†He tried really hard to socially integrate but was not so well accepted. He was very engaged in asking for advice and planning out his career. He‚Äôs also from China and he attributes a lot of his negative experience to racism or English being a second language. There might be some of that, but I don‚Äôt really think the nastier perceptions he has of colleagues is true. I think it might be mild undiagnosed neurodivergence. There‚Äôs also cultural and family baggage for him around performing and being successful so he‚Äôs feeling a lot of pressure and depair because of his first career experience with my organization went badly. I think he drank copious amounts of coffee and worked extra hours. Sometimes his approach seemed kinda performative ‚Äì celebrating the amount of work he did, or the complexity of the spreadsheet, but not quite ‚Äúgetting it.‚Äù

¬†Fast forward to 10 months into the role and his work and position transferred to another manager. He fell asleep at his desk again, continued with work that was in relatively poor shape. The new manager moved to fire him before his 12 month probation ended ‚Äì pretty quick without much of a warning shot. She consulted with me and I probably wouldn‚Äôt have moved in the same way, but I agreed‚Ä¶our experience had been that he was dragging down the team. HR gave him a chance to say that sleeping at his desk was related to a medical condition but he didn‚Äôt say it was ‚Äì he just said something like ‚ÄúI was bored‚Äù. The role was unionized but the union rep didn‚Äôt make an appearance.

¬†He‚Äôs got a lot of trust in me, and dislike for the manager that fired him. I don‚Äôt know if he ought to genuinely like me because I don‚Äôt know if I did him any favours. And he‚Äôs coming back for advice from me. In the 6 months since getting fired he‚Äôs had about 7 interviews in other organizations and they have all gone badly by the sound of it. He is attributing his lack of success to racism or nepotism, and saying to me that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve realized supervisors like you are few and far between‚Äù. Not going to say nepotism and racism don‚Äôt exist in my sector, but I expect there are genuinely things he is saying in the interview that are turning people off. He may also be badly lying about getting fired in his last job as he is saying that ‚Äúhis term ended‚Äù but may be saying so awkwardly. Maybe just little things like grooming or body odor are important too. He‚Äôs getting to the point where the gap in his resume is hard on finances and looking bad.

¬†He‚Äôs considering totally abandoning the field. I think a deeper self-understanding or maybe undiagnosed neurodivergence could help, and less ‚Äúfake it til you make it‚Äù struggling in areas that are not his strength. Our field is a lot of focus on interactions and politicking that I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll succeed at, but you can also get into more specialized technical work, which I think he might be good at. I‚Äôm grabbing coffee with him in a couple days to try and restore his confidence and give good advice.

¬†My questions:

* I‚Äôm not sure if my armchair diagnosis of being on the spectrum is right. Maybe he‚Äôs just not good with people/communication/analysis? Does the above thinking pan out from the experience of people who‚Äôve faced career struggles from being on the spectrum? ¬†
* He tends to be a bit bull-headed and doubt he‚Äôs ever considered the question. ¬†Is there a good way to say to him ‚Äúdo you think you might be neurodivergent?‚Äù If that‚Äôs a yes, is there a good online resource I can point them to for self-assessing his strengths and weaknesses, especially from a career perspective.
* Is a field that‚Äôs relatively political like mine a good one to be in? Should he try and make this field work by finding a niche wihtin it or better to consider a bigger shift to something totally different? He's in his late 20s, so wanting to land himself. ",1,1761148433.0,aspergers,1,1.0,False

When Covid hit I was in middle school and did online relationships, which I can now proudly look back at and just laugh. I was 12 trying to impress a girl/guy?? Like hello??? I dont really think of those as real relationships due to the fact me and the person would be able to hide behind a mask we had online. Now I'm a senior in high school and I see all the kids younger OR older (yes, im a 17yr old senior) in relationships while im just here like...think of that one meme with- hold on lemme find it- ah the hampter meme. I'm just in my own world reading, drawing, watching shows and sitting my butt down to play final fantasy. Besides that im playing soccer with my team, working out or on facetime calls with my long distance friends. (The one relationship I had was with a guy who admitted he was gay the last month we dated, then found out he cheated. which, fun I guess.)

And we cant forget the fact I also have a part time job.

Now this is where it all ties in, I'm not the most social or extroverted person unless I am with the right group of friends, if people who I don't know are present I am a totally different person. Quiet, reserved, almost trying to blend in with the crowd. It depends on my comfortable levels with the people, yknow? Because of this I don't really ""put myself"" out there and majority of the times im ok with that. Well lately, I keep seeing people on dates, buying gifts for there partners, tiktoks and youtube shorts about how much they love them and it makes me want to punch and yell in a pillow wondering why I cant have that. But then there are days where I am absolutely ok with no partner, and then im not, and then I am- Its just- Its just crazy. But when I think about it I wish I could have a partner. Like the idea of it is nice, I dont even care if you get me gifts. I just want someone who will listen to me rant, read with me, sit on the counters while I bake or even help. Late night anime watching with takeout and coffee/boba. Someone who will wanna do stupid crap with me, sledding at 2am? yes. Cosplaying favorite characters? HELL YEAH. Soccer matches against each other?? YeS SIR. going on vacation together?? PLZ. Summer camping?? yes. Christmas gift swapping?? YESS!!! Working out together?? Hell ill make your protein shakes. I just want someone I can love, who can love me too.

Looking at people today though it makes it seem like no one will actually want me yknow? Beauty standards changing, everyone being judged. I want to be able to be myself without feeling bad about it, but anyone ive seen these days want you for something your not. Am I just doing this wrong? Even if I put myself out more, I feel like I'll just be judged more. And this is like a big thing, especially because i'm also hispanic, but my accent sucks, I cant spanish as much as I want to spanish. I dont know much about my religion due to the fact I was never really taught. And I have the humor of a literal child (trauma hits hard IG). Looking at all these factors,  What should I like- do?? I want to try harder, I want to find someone that can like or love me as much as I enjoy/like or even love them, But I seriously doubt it based off what I've seen, and based off how much I know of myself.",1,1761148057.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

I currently go to school in the Eastern US, but attended high school overseas. Summer 2024, when I went to visit my family, I met up with my senior prom date\* for coffee and caught feelings something awful. The problem was that he was not due to leave the country for another year, and given the massive time difference, I did not pursue my feelings.

Over the past year, I have had one (short-lived) fling and turned down a few dating propositions. Most of the reason I have turned these guys down is that I'm still smitten with my friend.

He is now attending college on the West Coast. While this is much closer than before, he's still a whole continent away; our only means of communication is occasional texts. I want so desperately to confess my feelings, but don't want to a) ruin our friendship; b) put my foot in my mouth; c) expend energy into something that will probably not pan out logistically.

What do I do? I can't get over him, and it's driving me slowly insane.

	I‚Äôm woken up by the sound of my own mouth gasping desperately for air. Despite the brisk weather during the early hours of this fall morning I find myself completely drenched in a warm salty sweat. Blinking through the darkness, I probe the room for the red digits of the alarm clock. 3:46am it glares back at me. My chest heaves, dragging air as if I‚Äôve resurfaced from drowning. Did I wake from a nightmare? If so, the dreams left my mind the moment I awoke. I lay back in hopes that I can return to sleep quickly but I become acutely aware of how much I must have actually sweat in my sleep. Am I sick? Maybe a fever? I don‚Äôt remember feeling ill when I laid down for bed last night. Maybe I‚Äôll feel better after a glass of water. I make my way to the kitchen when I grab a cup from the cabinet and fill it with water from the tap. I lift the glass but gag before a drop reaches my lips, a brackish bile rising in my throat. Quickly I put the glass on the counter and prepare myself to make a mad dash for the trash can but the sensation leaves me as quickly as it came. Wide awake now, I decide now is as good a time as any to change my soaking bed sheets.

	I fetch clean sheets from my linen closet and replace the old, all the while wondering how they got so wet. I find it hard to believe I could have sweat so much and I hadn‚Äôt kept a cup of water by the bed‚Äîthere was nothing to spill in the night. Since I had come upstairs I‚Äôve felt perfectly normal so any sickness seems out of the question and I‚Äôm at a loss for an explanation. I meticulously arrange my pillows and tuck in my sheets and comforter knowing I‚Äôll climb in as soon as I‚Äôm finished. For a moment, I stand at the foot of the bed admiring my work. While in the bed, the thought never occurred to me but from this position it seems so painfully obvious that this is a bed for two. I quickly dismiss the thought and lay on the side of the bed I seem to subconsciously avoid. It feels wrong and I quickly roll back to the side of the bed that has the indent to match my form. 

I pick up my cell phone and see the picture of Aaron and I at Silverbrook Orchard. He took me to pick out pumpkins for us to carve and I picked the biggest one I could find. He nearly threw his back out carrying it for me. While not a short guy, he always seems somewhat insecure about not being some 6 foot tall he-man, so he‚Äôs always looking for ways to show he‚Äôs a man but he manages to do it in a way that is charming and not offputting. I feel my lips stretch into a small grin as I lay the phone on my nightstand but the expression quickly slips away as my eyes focus on the picture frame sitting on the nightstand. Within the frame is a photo of a smiling young woman in a white wedding dress, who I barely recognize as myself anymore. To my right stands Joseph in his black tuxedo standing tall, towering over me but smiling down with an expression that could never be mistaken for anything other than pure joy. Some people say that your wedding is so hectic that you don‚Äôt really get to enjoy it and that may be true for some, but for me it was truly the happiest day of my life. A wave of guilt washes over me and I quickly lay the frame face down. The absence of my wedding ring is suddenly inescapable. I fight to keep my eyes open, but sleep takes me before the tears can.

I wake slowly and naturally, no alarms interrupting my sleep. Eyes barely open, I turn to face my nightstand. I‚Äôm greeted by my own smiling face next to Joseph‚Äôs, and I give it with a meager smile of my own in return. I pick up my phone and see a text from Aaron 2 hours ago. ‚ÄúGood morning!!!‚Äô it reads. I typically find his overly excited tone cute but I decide I‚Äôd rather spend some time waking up on my own before being bombarded with affection. In the kitchen, last night‚Äôs untouched glass of water waits on the counter. I‚Äôm not sure why but I find myself hesitating to pick it back up. I grab the glass and begin to pour it down the sink, an uneasy tension felt in all my muscles. Without realizing, I had been holding my breath. I exhale with a tremble and I‚Äôm unsure why. I turn on the coffee maker and begin to make my way to the living room where I‚Äôll really start my lazy Sunday with some daytime television. As I walk past my front door I hear a metallic clank that I recognize as the mail slot. I turn to investigate and I see an envelope on the floor, a stark sea foam green contrasted with the mahogany hardwood floor. I step over the envelope and open the door to greet whoever was delivering mail on a Sunday. On the other side is my ordinary and mundane empty apartment hallway. I step into the hall looking both ways to see where the off duty mail person could have run off to but there‚Äôs no sign of anyone. Despite the empty hallway I felt the distinct sensation I was being watched and I found myself retreating to my apartment and slamming the door before I had even realized what I was doing. 

I look down at the envelope now between my feet, only now noticing that it's not labeled or marked in any way. I reached down to pick it up, the stiffness of its surface against my skin, the paper looked slightly warped, as if it had gotten wet but had been dried out. Before my mind could question the origins of this strange piece of mail I found my finger instinctively peeling the flap on the other side and of the envelope. Immediately my nose was filled with the earthy aroma of clay, other wet sediment, and algae. The same brackish taste returned to my mouth but this time I swallowed it as I pulled out the brittle paper housed within the sea foam envelope. I scanned the scrap of paper, torn, and discolored from whatever liquid it had once come into contact with finally stilling my gaze to the smeared text scribbled in the middle. In a handwriting that was instantly, and undeniably familiar to me read a simple message. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget what you promised the river.‚Äù  

My eyes snag on the words, their meaning slipping through me like water through fingers. My throat tightens. I blink hard and the page blurs‚Äîonly then do I realize the blur isn‚Äôt the paper but my own tears. Panic rises hot and sudden. There isn‚Äôt a day that goes by where Joseph doesn‚Äôt cross my mind but it‚Äôs not this often that I feel like his memory is inescapable. I‚Äôm overtaken by a surge of grief thinking of him again but after I have a moment to compose myself it‚Äôs replaced almost entirely by confusion. There‚Äôs no mistaking your own husband‚Äôs terrible chicken-scratch but dead men don‚Äôt send letters, let alone scraps of papers with nonsense scrawled on them. 

I choke up again, stifling tears. My mind flashes to the cold, sterile hospital rooms where our last moments were spent. The strong, tall man I knew sitting so perfectly still, sapped of all his energy, so tired of fighting a losing battle. While it pained me to see him in that state, he was just as beautiful to me. Truly he was my best friend, which sounds cliche but was especially true given that for a long time, he was my only friend. 

A soft knock on the door sends a jolt down my spine. I quickly stuff the letter into the pocket of my pajama pants and open the door. My heart stops as a waft of foul river water smacks me in the face. I see a man soaking wet, putrid green strips of seaweed draped over his clothes, his figure covered in pale bloated skin standing just outside the doorway. The hope etched on his face morphed into concern when he met my eyes. 
‚ÄúDanny, are you okay?‚Äù
Aaron‚Äôs voice awakens me from the horrified trance. I blink and see his kind eyes filled with unease, scanning me.
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not feeling well‚Äù I croak. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get much sleep last night and‚Ä¶‚Äù
I trail off and his apparent nervousness deepens. For a brief moment I think I see a twinge of jealousy. After giving me ample time to finish my thought he concludes it‚Äôs now his turn to speak.
He reaches out to touch my arm and I cringe anticipating the caress of cold wet skin, but instead his touch is warm and calming.
‚ÄúDo you need anythi-‚Äù
‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I retort in a tone that I hope doesn‚Äôt come off as aggressive. If it did, he makes no sign which helps to relax a bit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ just one of the hard days, you know?‚Äù
We sit in silence for a moment, seemingly both reflecting on our battles with grief.
He lightly squeezes my arm this time the silence emanating from him.
‚ÄúJust checking in on you.‚Äù he offers defensively.
He smiles, but beneath the mask he‚Äôs wearing I can see him hesitating to push me any further. I return a weak grin but say nothing. This is a dance that we‚Äôre both all too familiar with and he knows the steps very well. Our lips meet for a moment and then he trails down the hallway and out of sight as I close the door behind him, the distinct taste of mud on my lips. 

My mind swimming, I finally prepare my coffee and at least for a moment try to ignore the note in my pocket that is haunting me. The warm toasty aroma fills my nostrils and it brings a sense of calm with it. I breathe in every second of solitude I can before returning my mind to the mystery note. What promise could I have made, and to a river no less? I reach into my pocket to fish out the note but flinch at the touch of a cold metallic bite at my fingertips. Apprehensively, I explore my pockets for this new source of disquietude and can feel the metallic foreign object dredging itself into my palm. My hand exits my pocket with the now crumpled letter accompanied by my wedding ring. I rush to my bedroom and rip the small drawer out the nightstand bewildered to find that my ring was in fact not in my drawer. How did my ring get into my pocket and what the fuck does any of this have to do with the river? I had never even been to the river before the day I met Joseph. Or rather, the day I really met Joseph.

We met in high school, in that we were in the same graduating class but I don‚Äôt think we spoke a single word in the four years we spent wandering those halls. I was an outcast, for no real reason other than I didn‚Äôt know how to make friends. I like to say that it never bothered me but in truth it did, and it made me bitter and distrustful. I looked at my graduation as a rebirth, a chance to start anew. I fully intended on leaving my past life behind but the plans we make rarely pan out as we thought they would. It wasn‚Äôt even a month after graduation that I ran into some oversized, vacuous, varsity football player on the other side of the gas pump while filling up my sedan. Feeling as though I had seen a ghost from a life long gone, I tried my best to ignore it.
‚ÄúDanielle?‚Äù 
	Taken aback that he knew my name, and almost more so by how soft and comforting the sound of his voice was. The confusion must have been evident on my face, coupled with silence that filled the space where he was expecting a response. Perhaps in an attempt to recover he blurts out 
‚ÄúI recognize you from school‚Äù with a smile that admittedly did put me at ease.
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù comes out dismissively, in an attempt to end the conversation as I return the gas pump to its rightful place. 
‚ÄúDo you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?‚Äù he fires the second he sees me take a step towards my driver side door. I stop dead in my tracks.
A feminine voice replies
‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to.‚Äù His expression shifts from the somehow confident nervousness to a face of relief and I realize those words came from my own mouth. I didn‚Äôt drink coffee but as much as I told myself that I wanted to leave my old life behind, I wanted to get coffee with Joseph.

 I don‚Äôt know why I said yes, but I‚Äôve never regretted it. He quickly taught me that he was more than some vapid, varsity athlete, but a complex and compassionate person. He even taught me that I actually like coffee, I had only ever had terrible coffee before that. We sat in the Riverstone Cafe and he listened to me and for what felt like the first time, I felt like I was heard. Hours passed and Riverstone closed for the evening and I figured that would be the end of this unexpected ordeal until Joseph spoke.
‚ÄúDo you want to see the most beautiful place on Earth?‚Äù
Not long after we were sitting under a tree on the banks of the Hollowbend River watching the water flow, serene and unperturbed. I silently wondered how long it took for the water to carve this path through the Earth. To me, it seemed that it had been there forever, and would remain there forever. In truth our conversation that day had ended in Riverstone but in that moment there was no need for anything else to be said. We silently watched the river roll through the valley and I took his hand in mine.

A dull clink against the wood. It rang out too loud for such a small thing, as though the drawer itself winced at the weight of it. I swiftly closed the drawer causing the picture frame sitting atop the nightstand to shift. I make my way to the closet and pull out a heavy plastic storage bin and start my investigation for any clue of what promise I may have forgotten. I leaf through photo albums, seeing snapshots of my life. I‚Äôm astounded that by just flipping pages I can see myself go from the closed off little girl I always thought I was, to the outgoing person that Joseph forged me into. I remember almost feeling resentful early on when he would suggest we go out with friends of his, but I slowly stopped seeing myself as an intruder among their ranks and began to feel like part of the gang. Of all the good that came out of me meeting Joseph, in this moment I feel like his greatest gift to me was that realization. I‚Äôm filled with a sweet melancholy seeing the life the two of us had built before the cancer took it away depicted in front of me. My eyes start to glass over but I feel a comforting warmth as I think of times we shared together. I see the photos of us with all of our friends. All the parties, the dinners and get together. I think of the moments of inconsolable grief, but in spite of that feeling so loved and safe surrounded by all of my friends and suddenly the tears are flowing once more, but this time they‚Äôre those of overwhelming joy. All those moments after Joseph‚Äôs death where Janie, Tucker and Aaron practically lived in my apartment, guiding me through my anguish, and grieving with me. I truly don‚Äôt know where I would be without them. Suddenly a cold chill up my spine and I once again feel like I‚Äôm being watched. Quickly I close the album and shove the storage container back into the closet.
 
	Soon after I came to the conclusion that being alone was doing more harm than good so I agreed to meet Aaron at Riverstone. I sat at a table in the cozy cafe and stared at the passerbys on the street. Aaron stands in line waiting to order while I try to discreetly examine the cafe for anything that might remind me of whatever promise I may have made, all the while unable to shake the feeling that I‚Äôm being observed. Between the chatter of customers and hissing the different coffee machines the baristas use, the speakers emit a song that taunts me. ‚ÄúOnly memories remain, yeah, yeah‚Äù. Transfixed by the simple repeating line, it takes me a minute to realize that I‚Äôve been absently staring at another cafe patron sitting in the corner. I snap out of it only to realize that he is staring at me with unwavering focus. From across the room his features are indistinct to me but, somehow are off. I turned my head to see if there was someone or something outside that he was captivated by but there is nothing, or no one, only the river. I turn back to my original position and I can‚Äôt determine whether he‚Äôs looking at me or the river but neither of those possibilities alleviates the discomfort from his glare. Contact is broken as a shape comes between us.
	‚ÄúOne coffee for Danny, and one coffee for Aaron‚Äù playfully comes from Aaron, holding the beverages standing between my onlooker and I. 
	‚ÄúWell, take a seat!‚Äù  I try to match his jesting tone, hoping he doesn‚Äôt notice my fixation on the table on the other side of the cafe.
I‚Äôm relieved that he didn‚Äôt seem to notice my brief obsession with the other table and I fight back every urge to draw attention to it and look around him. He sits and I inconspicuously steal a glance over his shoulder and the man's features become more distinct. He‚Äôs clearly a tall, athletic man who‚Äôs in good shape. Aaron speaks but I don‚Äôt really hear him.
‚ÄúUh huh‚Äù I say without much thought, hoping it would be an appropriate response. I look into his eyes just long enough to feign interest in whatever he was saying but when he looks down at his coffee, my focus shifts over his shoulder once more. The strong jaw of the man is undeniably familiar and I almost jump to my feet believing that this must be an apparition of my husband brought to life but instead elect to break the visual contact using Aaron‚Äôs head. Aaron speaks again, still looking down at his coffee and I ignore him. I look over his shoulder once more to see my observer. Focusing on him more intently I now am relieved to see that this man is certainly not my husband. Just a man almost looking like he came straight from a sketch based on a description of Joseph, not quite a doppelg√§nger but pretty close.
Aaron speaks softly again and I realize how long I‚Äôve been ignoring him.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what?‚Äù I look to see that his eyes aren‚Äôt staring at his coffee but my left hand wrapped around my coffee cup.
‚ÄúWhen did you start wearing it again?‚Äù emotionlessly. He thinks that showing no emotion hides his indignation but it really only makes it more obvious how he‚Äôs feeling. 
Instinctively I cover my ring finger with my right hand. When did I put this on?
His voice softens and I see he‚Äôs already regretting coming off too harshly. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how I fit into this, Danny. With him still‚Ä¶ here.‚Äù
‚ÄúAaron, it‚Äôs not like that.‚Äù I plead. ‚ÄúI must have just slipped it on without even thinking when I was getting ready.‚Äù I reach for his hand hoping he‚Äôll accept my weak excuse. We lock hands and he gives a faint smile but it slips away as he speaks.
‚ÄúI know that you had a life before me, and I don‚Äôt want to take that away,‚Äù he assures me ‚Äúbut I want us to have a life together too.‚Äù
‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù
I slip the ring off my finger and put it safely into my purse. We share small talk and attempt to savage our date. He tells me about a recent trip to visit his parents, the neighborly drama at his apartment building and about the last movie he watched and I actually begin to feel normal again. I realize I‚Äôve been in something of a haze for the last few days so I don‚Äôt share many details in a similar fashion. In this moment it‚Äôs nice to be a part of something so unremarkable and normal. I look past him and see that the table with the not-quite-doppelg√§nger is gone. I feel the breath that I didn‚Äôt realize I was holding in escape in a relieved sigh. I silently chuckle to myself, feeling embarrassed that I let my widow‚Äôs guilt allow me to get so worked up.
 Sensing that my coffee was now at a drinkable temperature, I raised the cup to my lips. I feel the warm earthy liquid‚Äôs warmth emanate through me as I swallow. All my muscles, unknowingly living in a constant state of tension finally ease. Each breath serves as consolation. I silently wonder how I let myself become so closed off in the past few weeks, a mistake that I don‚Äôt intend to let continue. I let the warm air of the cafe, the soft buzz of chatter among patrons, and contentment of this moment wrap around me as I take it all in. I go to punctuate this idyllic moment with another large sip of my coffee but the toasty hazelnut flavor I anticipated is entirely replaced by a sour, metallic sludge. Faster than I can react, I once again feel a brackish bile race up my throat, but this time it escapes my mouth and I vomit.
I stand up embarrassed, still retching and Aaron asks me if I‚Äôm okay. I ask him to please get me a cup of water and he quickly marches to the counter to get me one as all eyes in the cafe look at me with a chilling concern. I feel all of the gawking and can‚Äôt bring myself to look up and meet the leer of any of the onlookers so I fixate on the table, looking at the mess I made. Among the bile and digested matter sits a piece of paper. I grab a napkin and sheepishly fish out the paper and am immediately relieved to find it‚Äôs Aaron‚Äôs receipt. I giggle to myself, feeling so foolish to think it would somehow be the note that was delivered to me. Aaron returns with the water that he sets on a part of the table that hasn‚Äôt been spoiled.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù he says to me.
‚ÄúJust the receipt. Sorry‚Äù I chuckle ‚ÄúI hope you didn‚Äôt need it.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, I know, I mean on the back of it?‚Äù 
I turn over the receipt to see the message ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt change course‚Äù in that familiar same script. My eyes read the message over and over, dumbfounded. I look to the empty table that the not-quite-doppelg√§nger was seated at and see wet footprints leading out to the cafe‚Äôs exit.
‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù I bark as a race to the exit.
I follow a trail of wet footprints though I already know where they end. I follow the wet footprints on the concrete that turn to muddy imprints in the grass. After a long walk I find myself on the same riverbank that Joseph took me on that first date. The footprints don‚Äôt stop but lead directly into the river. I sit against the tree trunk near the rivers edge and remember the last time we were here together. It was after he found out the cancer was stage four, ever the fighter, he wasn‚Äôt ready to give up but he was scared. We came here afterwards and watched the river just like we did all those years prior. For a long while we sat in silence. Finally it was broken by a command.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me.‚Äù
I sat, shocked by what I was hearing.
‚ÄúJoe, of course I wouldn‚Äôt leave you.‚Äù
He turned to me, grabbing me by the arms tightly, so tight it hurt.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave me, I‚Äôm going to make it through this.‚Äù he assured me, or maybe himself through choked breaths.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre scaring me, Joe.‚Äù I tried to break his grip but he was too strong.
‚ÄúPromise me, you won‚Äôt leave me.‚Äù he begged.
‚ÄúOf course I won‚Äôt‚Äù I breathe sincerely.
‚ÄúPlease, just promise me‚Äù now the sobs breaking through ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never leave.‚Äù
I joined him, my tears making it hard to speak.
‚ÄúI promise Joseph, I‚Äôll never leave you.‚Äù 
His grip around my arms released and is replaced by an embrace as we cherish what we both know could be the last one we share on this shore. And it was. For 7 grueling months I kept my promise as I watched him wither away, and then my life was over as I knew it. For months I lived as a husk, kept alive only by the good will of my friends and some vague hope that one day it wouldn‚Äôt hurt so bad. I loved and I grieved and in moments I still do.
I sat under that tree where I made my promise and I looked out into the water. On the other side of the river stood a figure that I immediately recognized as not-quite-doppelg√§nger. He looked at me and beckoned for me to join him on the other side. Between us was the deceptively rough water of the river and for a second I felt the urge to walk right in and try my best to make it to the other side. From behind me I hear Aaron‚Äôs voice. I turn to see him walking towards the river bank calling out my name. I reach down to find that my wedding ring on my finger once again. With silent tears, I remove it from my finger and toss it into the river.
‚ÄúDanny, thank god I found you, are you okay?‚Äù
I turn to the other river bank to see my not-quite-doppelg√§nger is gone.
‚ÄúYeah, I finally think I am.‚Äù

For some reason there's something wrong in the break room, and it is a cup of coffee.

Every time i enter the base, i start by cleaning, not using thrash bags, instead i simply use a shovel and make scraps, for selling porpuses (and kerfur). after cleaning the garage and the main entrance i clean the break room. Here it starts, sometimes theres just trash, i clean. Sometimes theres a cup of coffee, i thought it apeared when generating the base, then i tried to see it by creating a new save, but it was never there, after this i just forgot about it, and when it was there i just drank it, but today it just felt... wrong.

I did the exact same, enter base, clean garage, clean entrance room, then break room, i enter and clean, no coffee, me sad :(, i go back to continue cleaning, my hunger was low and theres an MRE that spawns in there, i go in there and... Coffee cup! in the middle of the room, just there... standing menacingly, it looked at me, i was confused, there wasn't any cup of coffee in there, how did it appear in here, who put it here, is it even real, i'm sure i cleaned that place, no coffee, but now there's coffee, i was just there thinking about the many ways that the coffee could apear out of nowere...

I sat there for hours with it, thinking... I was scared if coffee can just apear out of nowere, what more can it do? I was going insane, the idea of a interdimensional unrealistic coffee just apearing in your face. I know this coffee is important. I'll keep it, not drink, keep it as my lord and savior, he's the most important to me now. Hes everithing.

2) Enlarge menu and put on right side of trailer. Center as needed. If it‚Äôs a little blurry, that‚Äôs OK.
3) Underneath the serving window add: COFFEE, ESPRESSO, HOT CHOCOLATE, MILK SHAKES, ICE CREAM, DIRTY SODAS, SMOOTHIES, PASTRIES.
4) If you can remove the building behind the trailer, that would be great.
5) Scatter coffee beans around trailer. Remove blue tape that is on window. 

You can get creative if you like. Will pay multiple if we use those ideas.

1odbp4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1odbp4n/nf_a_trip/,[NF] A Trip.,"1.Morning. Didn‚Äôt know (actually I forgot) what time it was. We left the house and took a Uber car to the coach station.

2. We hadn‚Äôt planned to take a Uber. The original idea was to take a public bus to the station. The night before. we looked for possible travel options. Neither Xi nor I could find a suitable bus route. Xi suggested we just take a car to save some time. I said OK.

3. Xi and I stood by the roadside waiting for the Uber. It was rush hour. There were so many cars and people on the road. mainly cars. People were either driving or sitting in buses. From this. I figured that we must have left the house around 8 a.m.

4. We stood by the road waiting for the car. It was a foreign city in a foreign country. This was our first time here. We were two foreigners. and in this country. there weren‚Äôt many people who looked like us. Standing by the road. we stood out a little. People passing by would often turn their heads to look at us.

5. It felt like we had been standing there for quite some time. but the Uber car still hadn‚Äôt shown up.

6. Xi checked the map on her phone every now and then. It showed the location of the Uber car. At one moment. it seemed like the car was almost here. and the next. it was far away again. The driver seemed unfamiliar with the area or was trying to find a faster or shorter route but couldn‚Äôt. Eventually. the car stopped about a kilometer away from where we were standing. stopped moving. Maybe it was stuck at a traffic light or caught in a traffic jam. anyway. it stayed there for a long time without budging.

7. Xiaoxi and I continued waiting by the roadside. There was nothing else we could do but wait. I don‚Äôt remember if we changed our spot during this time. Maybe we did. or didn‚Äôt. I think we probably did.

8. The Uber car finally arrived. The driver called Xi to say he was here but couldn‚Äôt see us. We didn‚Äôt see him or his car either.

9. Xi described where we were standing and the color of our clothes to the driver. He told us he was on the other side of the road and asked us to cross over to meet him.

10. Xi and I prepared to cross the road. As I mentioned earlier. there were a lot of cars. all driving at quite high speeds. It was hard to find a chance to get across.

11. Finally. we waited for a gap with less traffic to cross the road to the other side. The Uber driver was talking to a police officer in a traffic police uniform. It seemed like they were discussing how. even though this wasn‚Äôt a designated parking area. the driver had to stop here to pick us up. The officer didn‚Äôt seem intent on giving him a hard time.

12. This was an armed officer. The shiny black grip of his handgun was exposed outside the holster. All the police officers I saw on the streets here were armed. Sometimes they were alone. and other times in small groups.

13. The officer opened the car door. gesturing for us to get in. and stood there watching as we drove away.

14. The route to the coach station wasn‚Äôt as complicated as I had imagined. It was mostly along the coastline. The seaside avenue was smooth and wide. with a tram track running down the middle. Earlier in the day. while playing by the sea. Xi and I had seen a red tram with two cars gliding along the tracks.

15. This is a coastal city in a seaside country.

16. The distance from the coach station to where we were staying wasn‚Äôt as far as we had imagined. At first. we didn‚Äôt know this. It was something we realized later.

17. According to the navigation description. the station was located on the basement level of a shopping mall. The drop-off point was along the seaside avenue. near a small plaza in front of the mall.

18. We didn‚Äôt immediately spot the entrance to the coach station. After a quick look around. we followed a group of people through an entrance and walked along a downward spiral ramp.

19. It turned out we were on the right path. Soon. we saw a large open area with many parked vehicles. mostly buses. However. we didn‚Äôt see the long-distance coach we were supposed to take.

20. Both Xi and I wondered if we had taken a wrong turn. But before long. we found the departure area for the long-distance coaches.

21. This wasn‚Äôt an official long-distance coach station. It was primarily a hub for local buses. serving as one of several pick-up points for long-distance coaches scattered around the city.

22. We looked for a ticket counter but couldn‚Äôt find one immediately. A middle-aged man sitting behind a shabby office desk in the corridor told us we could buy tickets from him. He didn‚Äôt ask where we were going or mention how much the tickets cost.

23. Xi asked him how much it was per person to the old town. He said. ‚Äú49.‚Äù

24. We handed him a 100 bill. He gave us two 1 coins as change but didn‚Äôt hand us any tickets or tell us the departure time or boarding location.

25. The coins looked a lot like British one-pound coins. round. with a gold-colored outer ring and a stainless-steel nickel alloy center. One side had a large ‚Äú1.‚Äù and the other featured the profile of a person‚Äôs head.

26. On the bench next to the ticket desk. a few people sat. seemingly also waiting for their bus. It wasn‚Äôt clear if they were locals or tourists.

27. More people arrived one after another to buy tickets and then waited quietly nearby. No one said much.

28. Xi and I didn‚Äôt sit down (there weren‚Äôt any available seats anyway. and the weather was cold). nor did we just stand there waiting for the bus.

29. We didn‚Äôt dare wander too far. so we strolled aimlessly around the area. keeping an eye on every vehicle that came by. in case it was the bus we were supposed to take.

30. From where we stood. we could look up and see the mall building.

31. I told Xi there was a tree on the mall‚Äôs rooftop. a real tree. I took a picture of it with the sky in the background. I couldn‚Äôt tell what kind of tree it was. but I‚Äôve always had a fondness for all kinds of trees.

32. The mall was a brand-new modern building with a geometric design. Xi suggested we check it out when we came back next time.

33. A police car drove up and stopped by the roadside opposite to the ticket desk. where a bus had just pulled out. After a while. the police car drove off again.

34. Nothing happened. Some people got up from the bench and stood nearby. still waiting for their bus. Others sat down on the bench. There were at least two benches along the wall.

35. A vehicle pulled up. a medium-sized coach. Xi immediately said. that was the one we were taking.

36. I walked closer to take a good look at the vehicle. The sign behind the front windshield clearly displayed the name of the ancient town we were heading to.

37. We boarded the coach. Someone came on and asked everyone to fasten their seatbelts and wear their masks. The medium-sized coach didn‚Äôt leave right away. it stayed parked for a while longer.

38. Shortly after the coach left the station. it stopped by the roadside behind the mall to pick up a few more passengers. The driver got out to help them load some items into the luggage compartment on the side of the bus. Only then did the coach get on the main road and begin the journey.

39. The ancient town is a very famous destination. often featured in travel guides. However. I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in such descriptions. and neither Xi nor I had read any of them. We were simply visiting this city and decided to check out the nearby ancient town since it wasn‚Äôt far away.

40. The road to the ancient town mostly followed the coastline. In some areas. the road was closer to the sea. while in others, it was slightly further away. Even in the more distant sections. it was likely no more than a few hundred meters from the shore.

41. Between the road and the seaside is a strip of land with houses and trees. They all look quite charming. or at least unique. In some places. there are a few rowing boats lying around. possibly near repair shops. or small vegetable gardens. From a distance. it‚Äôs hard to tell what vegetables are being grown in those gardens.

42. Trees and houses block the view of the nearby coastline. but beyond the houses and trees. you can see the bay and the houses on the hills across it. The sea is a bright. vibrant blue.

43. On the other side of the road are mountains. Houses are built from the foothills all the way up the slopes. From a distance. they appear densely stacked in layers. while up close. they are more scattered and irregular.

44. The coach carried us (me. Xi. and some other passengers) farther and farther from the city. The houses along the roadside became increasingly sparse. but they didn‚Äôt look too shabby. On the hillsides, all that was visible were clusters of low shrubs. mostly typical plants of this climate zone.

45. After more than an hour. the coach arrived at a small town about 20 kilometers away from our final destination. the ancient town.

46. Xi suggested that we could get off here first and then take another ride to the ancient town.

47. The road cut through the centre of the small town. and the coach stopped by a signpost along the roadside.

48. Xi and I got off the coach and stood by the roadside. It was a cloudy day. and a light rain was falling.

49. We opened a portable umbrella but were unsure which direction to take. We didn‚Äôt know much about this small town.

50. On either side of the road were stores selling construction materials and sparsely scattered residential houses. It didn‚Äôt feel like a typical small town with many residents bustling around.

51. Our destination was the site of an ancient village near the town. We only knew it was nearby but had no additional information.

52. Walking along the roadside with the umbrella. we looked for a restroom and found a public toilet guarded by an elderly local man. where a small fee was charged. The rain stopped, and we put the umbrella away. Up ahead, a low hill was visible in the distance.

53. The map didn‚Äôt show any clear markers for the ancient village ruins.

54. Xi suggested asking someone for directions. Nearby. there was a supermarket that appeared to be part of a common local chain. We had shopped at one of their stores in the city twice before and found them reliable.

55. Xi went inside and asked a slightly overweight young employee about the location of the ancient village. The shop assistant. who could speak a bit of basic English. was standing with another young colleague behind the meat counter.

56. The young shop assistant tried to explain but couldn‚Äôt clearly describe where the ancient village was. Eventually. he wrote down an address in the local language on a piece of paper and handed it to Xi. saying. maybe this is the place you‚Äôre looking for.

57. We crossed the road and headed toward the location the shop assistant had pointed out. Ahead was a gentle hill dotted with houses of varying heights. following the natural contours of the land.

58. Not far across the road. we saw two round stone houses. Outside each one. a darkened wooden windmill stood attached to the wall.

59. I pointed toward the windmills and told Xi. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go there first to see the windmills and figure out what those round stone houses are.‚Äù

60. The stone houses were perched on a higher spot. As we got closer. they didn‚Äôt appear as tall as they had from a distance. It was hard to tell what they were used for. They looked like granaries but didn‚Äôt quite fit the type. If they were mills. the interior space didn‚Äôt seem large enough. The windmills no longer turned but still retained the appearance of windmills.

70. This seemed to be the entrance to the village. Moving past the stone houses. we found more low stone buildings ahead. Some had two stories. while others were single-story. Some appeared run-down. while others had recently been renovated. looking much more appealing.

71. I told Xi that while these houses looked nice. living in them might not feel very comfortable. That was just my impression ‚Äî I‚Äôd never actually lived in such houses.

72. The ancient village was reportedly built by a group of foreigners who once settled here. For unknown reasons. they all later moved away. leaving behind this old stone village. It must have been densely populated at its peak. with many small alleys crisscrossing the area. Now. some people run guesthouses. bars. and various small shops here. but most of the buildings remain vacant.

73. The alleys were quiet. with few people around. The ground was somewhat messy. and in some places. construction debris left over from the renovation of these houses still lingered. The alleys carried a mixture of smells ‚Äî burning wood. fermenting hay. and horse manure.

74. There was no visible wood or manure around. yet the smell seemed to emanate from the old houses and streets.

75. This used to be a bustling village. home to farmers. vendors. and merchants. The streets were once piled high with firewood. and many horses. even camels from distant places. would have been tethered here. Those low stone houses might have been stables and livestock shelters. and the lingering smells seemed to come from those places.

76. This village is somewhat similar to a seaside village we visited when we were in Hangzhou. stone houses. all built along the coast.

77. Perhaps due to the pandemic. it‚Äôs much less crowded here compared to that village on the Zhejiang coast.

78. Xi said this village is prettier than the other one. but it‚Äôs too deserted. We didn‚Äôt come across a single tourist here. The only people we saw were a few middle-aged local men lounging idly outside their shopfronts. staring at us as we walked past.

79. After wandering around the village. there wasn‚Äôt much else to see. Xi suggested we head to the ancient town instead since there was still enough time. We‚Äôd initially planned to have lunch here. but we could eat when we reached the town.

80. As we tried to leave the old village. we ended up back where we started. We were lost.

81. We saw two middle-aged. slightly older local women walking by. carrying shopping bags. We had met them earlier when we first entered the village as they were heading out. Now they were returning with their shopping. One of the women was carrying what looked like milk in her bag.

82. We hesitated for a moment. Xi decided to approach them and ask for directions. After a brief conversation that didn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere. the woman carrying the milk gestured for the other woman to head home first. She offered to take us to the bus station herself. This surprised both Xi and me.

83. She spoke a little English and switched between English and the local language as we walked. We understood bits and pieces. From what we could gather. she had been living in this town for four years. She said it was a beautiful place and that she loved it here.

84. Xi and I used a phrase we had just learned in the local language to tell her that we also thought the place was beautiful. She was delighted to hear this. She had a distinctly East Asian face. with flat features and a matching skin tone.

85. The woman carrying the milk took us along a different route. It turned out that the path Xi and I thought was correct was actually wrong. The route we had dismissed as going in the opposite direction was actually the right one.

86. The old village and the entire town are located at a high point. a hilltop of a massive slope. The area at the top is so large and flat that it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre on a hill. Only when looking out at the distant. the lower slopes make you realize how elevated the ground beneath you is.

87. The path the woman with the milk took us on runs along the edge of the town and the old village. On one side of the path. you can look down into a vast. open valley. At the valley‚Äôs base lies a cluster of houses with red-tiled roofs. which might actually be the main part of the town. The spot where we had gotten off earlier was just along a road on the outskirts of the town.

88. The woman led us along the road for a long time. At one point. Xi and I started to doubt if we were even on the right path. Did she really understand where we wanted to go. Could she be a scammer. Her shopping bag looked heavy, too.

89. After passing a scrapyard filled with rusting. abandoned vehicles. we finally saw the two round stone houses we had noticed when entering the old village. Not far from the stone houses. we also spotted the road we had arrived on.

90. Both Xi and I were relieved. She had understood us after all. and the path she took us on was the correct one.

91. She walked us to a bus stop shelter and didn‚Äôt leave right away. She insisted on taking my phone number and even tried dialing it once to confirm.

92. Xi and I couldn‚Äôt understand why she wanted our phone number. Since we didn‚Äôt speak the same language. even if she called us. we wouldn‚Äôt understand what she was saying.

93. Later. Xi brought it up at least twice. She suggested it might have been in case we got lost again. so we could contact her for help. That explanation made some sense.

94. This stop was for coaches heading back. The bus stop for the route to the ancient town was across the road. at the exact spot where we had gotten off earlier.

95. We stood by the roadside waiting for a coach. The one that arrived was a minibus headed for the ancient town. The driver pointed at a fare chart posted inside the minibus. indicating we should pay the amount listed.

96. It was a short-distance minibus. and apart from Xi and me. all the passengers were locals. mostly elderly people and women with children.

97. The journey to the ancient town was noticeably longer than expected. Along the way. people frequently got on and off the minibus. At one point. we went up a steep slope only to go back after reaching the top. We didn‚Äôt understand why. Since we weren‚Äôt familiar with the area beforehand. we later looked at a map and realised the entire route passed through a narrow peninsula. The ancient town we were headed to was located at the very tip of the peninsula.

98. By the time we got off the minibus at the ancient town. it was already noon. The ancient town was bustling with people and vehicles. noticeably livelier than the small town we had passed through earlier. Most of the people here seemed to be local residents. whereas the other town was primarily a vacation spot. mostly frequented by tourists. With it being off-season and many countries having closed their borders due to the pandemic. the vacation town had naturally been quieter.

99. Xi said she liked the ancient town more because it felt more alive. I agreed. We had lunch at a restaurant that was clearly run by locals. The menu featured a traditional local dish (which seemed popular since most people in the restaurant were eating the same thing).

100. After lunch. we left the restaurant and walked along a narrow. crowded street without any particular destination. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the town‚Äôs main street. but I wasn‚Äôt worried. The ancient town wasn‚Äôt very large. and it would be easy to cross it from any direction. Perhaps from sitting on the coach and the minibus too long. my stomach didn‚Äôt feel great.

101. On both sides of the street were all kinds of shops.

102. Xi bought a can of drink at a small shop. I noticed a local brand of beer, which is one of the country‚Äôs best-selling beers. In the end. I thought about buying it but didn‚Äôt.

103. I saw a tall stone building with a very spacious interior. From the exterior. it seemed like it might have originally been a church or a government building for public use. Now it‚Äôs an exhibition hall. with some stalls inside selling clothes.

104. Continuing forward. at the end of the street was a small square. From there. we could see the bay. Near the coast. many boats were docked in the bay. mostly white-painted sailboats and yachts. A large cargo ship was anchored near a pier a little farther away. Around the square were cafes and restaurants.

105. I told Xi that in ancient times. this place was a military fortress and an important port. I wasn‚Äôt very familiar with its history. so what I said was somewhat speculative. You could say it was an analysis and judgment based on limited information. At least a third of what I usually say contains things I‚Äôm not entirely sure about. This is one of my many flaws. Sometimes. even though I know it‚Äôs inappropriate. I can‚Äôt help myself and end up saying it anyway.

106. On the left side of the square stands a massive stone building resembling a castle. Its scale is enormous. and what we see here is only a small portion of it. The stone is a common gray-white material found in this region. The entire castle shares this gray-white hue. blending in with the surrounding mountains. which are covered in stones of the same color. When I first arrived in this region. I remarked to Xi about how extravagant the people here must be ‚Äî using marble even for paving stones.

107. Along the roadside outside the castle. a few iron cannons are on display. Their thick barrels are coarse and heavily rusted. clearly aged. These are authentic historical artifacts. likely many years old.

108. The castle was once a critical military facility. a strategic fortress. Historically. it was the site of a famous large-scale naval battle. Today. it serves as a museum dedicated to that chapter of history. This is something I learned after visiting the museum. which also confirmed some of my earlier observations.

109. The interior of the castle is vast and complex. Thousands of years ago. this region was occupied by another very famous empire. In addition to artifacts related to the castle‚Äôs history. the museum houses numerous relics connected to that ancient empire, primarily sculptures and architectural carvings made of white marble.

110. I saw some glassware dating back to before the Common Era. almost identical to the glass items you‚Äôd see in modern laboratories. There were also ceramic water jars that were clearly salvaged from the seabed. still bearing traces of marine life like barnacles and shells.

111. Xi. feeling tired. sat down to rest in an exhibition hall. I continued to climb to the higher parts of the castle to see areas that couldn‚Äôt be observed from nearby outside.

112. The castle seemed to be built on a small hill or perhaps merged seamlessly with one. From the outside. the hill itself was invisible. In a way. it felt as though the castle had enveloped the hill. making it an integral part of its structure.

113. Climbing higher. I reached a slightly sloped rectangular flat area. which could also be described as a small plaza. At one end of the plaza. there was an abandoned piece of machinery of unknown purpose. Scattered across the center were fragments of white marble carvings from ancient architecture. exquisitely detailed but somewhat damaged. I noticed a small shard of colorful pottery and considered picking it up but ultimately didn‚Äôt.

114. Light rain began to fall again. The sky had been overcast since leaving in the morning. with intermittent rain. Apart from me. there were a few other visible tourists. a couple. and a pair of men who might have been close friends or possibly a couple too. it seemed more like the latter.

115. One of the men stood on a narrow staircase. striking various poses while the other took photos of him. On a platform in one corner of the castle. I spotted two women. one younger and the other middle-aged.

116. At the highest point of the castle. the view stretched wide and far. From here. the entire bay was visible. I snapped a few overhead panoramic shots of the castle and recorded a 360-degree video circling the entire structure. I was ready to head down and show it to Xi.

117. On the right side of the castle (below. near the small square and behind the restaurant). there‚Äôs a small hill with several houses scattered on it. At the top of the hill stands a high-voltage transmission tower.

118. I didn‚Äôt take the same route down as I had on the way up. I ascended one side of the castle. but descended on the other. Along the way. I passed a middle tier of the castle with a stone parapet facing the bay. This was not the route I took earlier. On this level. I spotted the two women I had seen before ‚Äî they were at one end of the platform. I now noticed many firing holes and lookout points along the walls. At regular intervals. there were heavy iron cannons. each accompanied by piles of round iron or stone cannonballs. The cannon barrels pointed directly out to sea.

119. I made my way down and reunited with Xi. who was still sitting in the same exhibition room where we had rested earlier. From the time I left to when I returned. the entire trip up and down took about half an hour.

120. For the return trip. the bus stop wasn‚Äôt at the same spot where we had gotten off earlier. Xi asked the coffee shop owner (we had a cup of coffee inside). but he couldn‚Äôt give a clear answer. He went to ask another person sitting outside the shop. That person spoke a little English and managed to give us a rough idea of the location and directions.

121. Walked 2 kilometers to the long-distance coach station. The station was hidden in a secluded courtyard by the highway. Went to buy our tickets first. but the young staff at the ticket window said tickets could be purchased on the bus.

122. On the way back. felt unusually drowsy. Both Xi and I fell asleep for a while. When we woke up. it was already dark. The coach was nearing the city. We could see the lights in the houses along the roadside and on the hills around the bay.

123. Got off by the roadside near the mall where we had boarded the bus earlier. Xi asked if we should sit in the mall for a while before heading home. I said. Okay.",1,1761147523.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

1odbmey,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness40plus/comments/1odbmey/lesson_2_relationship_with_food_in_weight_loss/,Lesson 2: relationship with food in weight loss,"Hey there, I recieved many dms appreciating my last post. So thought of simplifying everything for you all. 

First of all, green tea, coffee or any other sponsored drink that a dumb dick sells is not going to get your stomach ""snatched"".
The only thing that matters is CALORIES IN AND CALORIES OUT. 

Carbs are not your enemy. Fats are not your enemy. Sugary drinks yeah they might be. 
Dont fear pizza or burger cause that's all they are. Food. Not bad or good food. Just food. 

So why is there fear around foods? Well they are generally higher in calories and are less satiating than say sweet potatoes so people tend to eat those and add other things so feel full. Leading to high calorie consumption. Does it mean that you have to give up your favorite cookies or papa John's Pizza? Heck no. I would rather have my fingers crushed  in a door than quit these bits of happiness from my life. 

The key is moderation. 

We all have our caloric window, in which we can eat absolutely anything we want and still lose weight. The snacks just tend to take a bit more space in that window leading to fear that pizza is bad and chicken breast boiled is good.

You can gain weight even if you eat way too many chicken and rice and lose weight even if you only eat  two burgers and not live a sedentary life. Choice is yours, given you also need fiber and you dont really get that much from those two slices of cabbage. 

Also getting into carbs. Carbs are not your enemy as people make it out to be. 1g of carbs hold 4g of water in your body. 

It's a bit more complex to explain but I'll try to make it simple. Basically if you are used to eating carbs and you switch to keto which is personally awful for me, you'll lose water weight which your body stores. Those massive reduction in weight is not fat. It's just water. That's all. Nothing miraculous in that.

You can gain weight even in keto diet if you go beyond your maintenance level. 

Carbs get the bad rep because people dont understand what happens with the body. 

1. Diet consisting of 1200 calories at maintenance level which has like 250g of protein and some fat and fiber will lead to a steady result on the scale. 

2. If you keep the calories the same and add carbs and reduce protein a bit and fat, it will lead to a massive spike on the scale. 

Now it's understandable how a person can feel that they have been eating the same calories and just started eating carbs and that led to weight gain and now you fear carbs. But understand that carbs are just holding more water making you look fuller too. I am sorry if I was not very clear with this one, i hope you get the idea. 


Also medications which says that side effect is weight gain, isn't making you gain weight by its own unless it's messing with hormones. Generally it's just making you hungrier which leads to you eating more and then you know gaining more weight, so people who deal with those have to be slightly more cautious. Mindful actually.  If I have missed any point I'll edit it in. Good luck ^‚Å†_‚Å†^",7,1761147360.0,fitness40plus,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôd get fruity, floral, acidic, tea-like flavours. Interesting? Sure. But not what I wanted from my morning espresso. I wanted coffee ‚Äî bold, deep, aromatic, with a slight ‚Äúroasted coffee‚Äù bitterness. Like that flavour you get from a real Italian espresso!

The article basically makes the argument that men have withdrawn from society and despite all the online rhetoric about loneliness and craving connection, it‚Äôs not really leading to young men looking towards real life, human connection through making plans with friends, joining activity groups, and patronizing third spaces.

Both of us help facilitate these discussion groups and book clubs for a local nonprofit and trying to figure out why more people aren‚Äôt coming. We‚Äôve done lots of advertising on social media, printed out flyers and posted them on community boards around town in coffee shops, record stores, libraries, etc., but only had a few new people join and all of them were women. So I got to talking to a couple other ‚Äúconveners of young people‚Äù in my city and they had a similar experience, women are far more likely to attend these sorts of events no matter if they‚Äôre more intellectual, social, or philanthropic in nature. 

It feels like for so many men there‚Äôs this real mental block - they want to be less isolated and have more friends and less on the fringes of society, but something is preventing them from actually going out and joining a club, calling a friend, or picking up a new hobby to help them meet people.

So I‚Äôm curious, especially for the folks who identity with the ‚Äúmale loneliness epidemic‚Äù rhetoric, what prevents you from making real life, human connections over digital ones?

I forget what I know and remember what undoes me.
My room is half clean. My mind is full of noise.
I keep staring at the walls of this pit I decorated.
Lift my chin. Teach me to look up.

You know my drift.
The lazy reach for ease.
The quick fix that empties me.
The pride that judges.
The envy that bites.
The anger that flashes.
The little lies that try to keep me safe.
I call them what they are and lay them at Your feet.

My heart is an altar.
Every day something burns.
Let it be praise, not idols.
I do not re-offer what You finished once for all.
I offer myself.
Consume what fights You.
Kindle what loves You.

I remember the garden.
Sweat like blood. Crimson like rain.
You took my cup and drank the grave.
For a breath it seemed like God had died.
But the stone moved and the story broke its chains.
Stories do not die when the dead come alive.

You are not a system. You are a Savior.
Not a ceremony. A Shepherd with scars.
You speak and worlds hold together.
You breathe and hearts wake.

Meet me in the pictures You have been using.
Like the boy who washed the black dog till he shone,
wash me with water and the word.
Let me see that what I feared to be touched is healed by your gentle touch.
Let the master I abandoned and ran from become the friend that follows close.
Make Your kindness the towel. Make Your mercy the basin.

And when my heart asks, ‚ÄúWhy this joy now?‚Äù,
answer me: ‚ÄúBecause My goodness never left you‚Äî
I taught you loyalty and meant you no harm.‚Äù
Like that boy‚Äîinnocent and brave, wanting only to love‚Äî
You have always only wanted my good.
You were faithful before I ever tried to be;
I trust because You stayed.
Stitch my shaky vows to Your unbreaking Yes.

Like the fox who learned to aim his wild,
teach my wild to serve love.
My gifts were never meant to steal.
They were made to sow and nourish and guard.
Aim my hunger at what is good.
Aim my courage at what is true.
Aim my joy at what gives life.

Like the cubicle that names a numb soul,
You know the chair that fits my apathy.
Break the spell of fluorescent days.
Let my work become a quiet hymn.
Let small faithfulness weigh more than fame.

You have spoken in other small things.
A radio that only carried the call once I turned it on.
Teach me to turn my dial toward You.
Teach me to pick presence over noise.
Give me a signal that trains my steps.
Give me a song that steadies my breath.

When desire wakes first, show me the way of escape You promised.
When shame arrives before coffee, remind me there is no condemnation in Christ.
Let that verdict be the floor under my feet,
and Your ‚Äúfollow Me‚Äù the road in front of me.

I have argued about roots and fruit.
You saved me by grace through faith, not by works.
Root in You. Fruit from You.
Let my trust drink deep till love grows without forcing.
Keep me from trusting my faith as if it could save me.

Let me trust You, Jesus.
Trusting alone in You saves.
Works grow when roots drink from grace.
Let my fruit be real because my root is in You.

Guard me from the Pharisee within.
Slow my contempt. Grow compassion.
Make my judgments gentle and my mercy quick.
Let me be a witness, not a warden.
Let me carry truth without crushing bruised reeds.

For the woman I care about who cannot see,
guard her and draw her.
For friends with heavy nights, give comfort.
For my family who enable and wander, be their Shepherd and mine.
For those who deny who You are, open the eyes of the heart.

Teach me ordinary faithfulness.
One message taken to heart.
One honest prayer at my desk.
One door shut to darkness.
One door opened to a brother.
Make cleaning my room a liturgy, not a verdict.
Make my paycheck an altar, not a god.
Make my rest an act of trust, not an escape.

When I fall, let me fall forward into mercy.
When I rise, let it be by Your strength.
When I cannot feel, let me still choose You.
When I am afraid, hold me fast.

Lord Jesus, Friend and King,
take this altar and set a fire that does not go out
until faith becomes sight and I see Your face.

Why hide in dark when Light has a name.

I've recently bought a KBGV after spending hours researching online. I'm a \~500ml a day coffee drinker, and I consume that in two cups over about an hour. So, the 'One' would be too small, while the steel carafe ones would be probably an overkill for what I need (plus reports that the steel adds some flavor of its own). Of course, a big part of that is that I fell in love with the KBGV in yellow when I first saw it, which emboldened my decision :D.

Now, given that I drink my 500ml over an hour, I have two straightforward options, and a silly one: 

  
1. Fill everything to a 500ml cup, which keeps warm for about 30 minutes and then cools down rapidly.

2. Fill a small cup and keep the rest on the hotplate to fill up after 30 minutes or so, which -presumably- degrades the coffee flavor (I might have experienced that, but not sure whether that was a placebo feeling or not)

3 (silly): After brew is over and serving the first small cup, pour the rest into a thermos. Seems like too much of work.

What would be the best? And, is there any solution (either by Technivorm or 3rd party) for a steel carafe compatible with the KBGV?

I am now 16 years old. When i was 14, i had a really hard time dealing with emotions, and thats when i first felt my heart working overdrive. I felt like i couldnt breathe, i got tired easily even just like small steps, my heart beats faster whenever i stand up. and then it slowly affected my everyday life.

Now, i brought this conversation to my mom. the ecg showed irregular heartbeat, but my doctor said it was okay. but i kinda dont feel confident with what she said because i dont feel okay!

On my part however, school has been really tiring so there are days where i lacked sleep and relied on coffee. i sometimes drink coffee 2 times a day. But even without coffee, i just feel like my heart is always heavy and i have trouble breathing sometimes. Whenever i inhale i feel like i need more air and the air that i was taking in wasnt enough. even its a short distance walk, i still feel like im about to pass out because my heart is reaally heavy. üò≠üò≠üò≠ 

sorry if my experiences sound kinda confusing but right now my heart is really heavy and i kinda have a hard time breathing. But i checked my ecg on my samsung watch and it said that i was okay...

At first, I was confused, and when he got very close to me, I felt pressure. At that moment, I was so anxious that my vision blurred, I froze, and I avoided looking at him.

I‚Äôm honestly tired of being stuck in this loop and I really want to change this time. I‚Äôve made a diet plan for myself and would really appreciate it if you guys could take a look and tell me if it makes sense or if I‚Äôm missing something important.

A bit about me:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm in my final year of college.
	‚Ä¢	I usually wake up around 7 AM.
	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt feel like eating anything till my breakfast break at 10:30 AM.

Here‚Äôs my current diet plan:

Breakfast (10:30 AM)
	‚Ä¢	100g Pintola High Protein Oats ‚Äî 392 kcal, 25g protein
	‚Ä¢	250ml Provilac High Protein Milk ‚Äî 152 kcal, 25g protein

Lunch (1:30 PM)

She does have her location shared with me so when she didn't come straight back after dropping the kids off, I pinged her location to see where she went. I'm thinking, maybe she went to Starbucks or Dunkin? But instead I  noticed she was 20 min out from where we live, at some park. So I'm thinking wth is she doing out there?

So, I did find out directly from her. She didn't hesitate to tell me and immediately said where and what she's doing. No lies. I called, She picked up the phone, and when I asked where she was she did tell me where she is. ""I'm at so-so park playing pickleball with my coworker"". I paused and asked with who? ""Oh, with John (obviously not his real name, and , not sure if this really matters, but John is married as well)"" I gave another longer pause and just came straight out and asked ""are you serious? You don't think this is a little sketch?? You literally went 25 min out to meet some guy, first thing in the morning and gave no mention to me about it? wtf?""

I had to get to work so the conversation ended there. She texted approx 45 min later, explaining she was just coming out for a quick game then go work on her term paper. And saying if she was being sketch, she wouldn't of picked up the phone when I called.

I haven't spoken to her since this past Monday. Haven't replied to her texts. We have kids so we're basically in Auto pilot at the moment doing our parental duties.

I'm trying to gather myself before trying to speak to her because, 1- this hurts me. A lot. it's a huge deal and 2 - my wife's emotional intelligence is, unfortunately, not really all that strong so trying to get through this issue will really need some steel and delicacy when time comes to broach the subject

No, I, 100%, do not find this okay. I would never meet up with another woman, solo, for any sort of recreational activity (lunch, coffee, bowling, pickleball, whatever). To me, I find that to be out of equation once you're married. And I am also 100% certain she would most definitely NOT approve it the situation if the roles were reversed. 

I really and truly do want to give this a benefit of the doubt. But, ultimately, this is something I feel she hid and intentionally did so. Which, to me, is a huge breach of Trust. Out of our nearly 15 years together she's never given me any indication of infidelity. Never saw it to be her character.

I feel like I already know how to approach this. I do essentially have a rough draft and bullet points to bring up but Posting here for any further advice and some insight I may not have thought of to bring to the table. Other possible thoughts I may be missing.

Thanks.

1odb3zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1odb3zk/the_catalyst_sirens/,The Catalyst Sirens,"Chapter 1: The Melody of Brockport

Brockport, New York ‚Äî a quiet little college town with brick sidewalks, cozy caf√©s, and the kind of autumns that painted the world in amber. Among its everyday rhythms lived **three inseparable girls** who shared one dream: to sing their way into the world‚Äôs heart.

There was **Lila Torres**, the confident leader of the trio ‚Äî half Puerto Rican, half Italian, with caramel skin and eyes that shimmered like coffee under the sun. She had a voice that once cracked during talent shows but never stopped her from singing louder.

**Maya Sinclair**, the soft-spoken soul of the group ‚Äî African-American with long braids, a love for poetry, and a tone so gentle that it could calm storms. She dreamed of writing songs that healed the world.

And **Harper Quinn**, the wild heart ‚Äî Irish-American, red hair with electric blue streaks, and the energy of a firecracker. She could turn any cafeteria into a concert hall with her air guitar and raspy vocals.

They called themselves **The Songbirds**.

Ever since kindergarten, they sang together at school events, in each other‚Äôs basements, even at open mic nights in the village. They weren‚Äôt famous ‚Äî just three girls with microphones and dreams.

But life had other plans.



# Chapter 2: High School Harmonies

Freshman year at Brockport High came with new challenges: confusing crushes, algebra homework, and endless talk about mutant sightings across New York State.

Ever since something called *The Catalyst* ‚Äî a mysterious super mutant X-gene ‚Äî began spreading around the world, strange stories surfaced everywhere. Some people could breathe underwater, others could glow, or even shift shapes.

To Lila, Maya, and Harper, mutants were just part of the news. They had bigger things to worry about ‚Äî like auditioning for the Spring Arts Festival.

‚ÄúHarper, you *cannot* wear leather pants to a school performance,‚Äù Maya laughed one afternoon in the music room.

‚ÄúWhy not? If Madonna can, so can I,‚Äù Harper winked, strumming her guitar.

Lila sighed, fixing her microphone. ‚ÄúGuys, we need to *blend*, not blind the judges. Let‚Äôs focus. We‚Äôve got one chance.‚Äù

Their harmonies rose through the room ‚Äî uneven, human, and heartfelt. A few kids stopped to listen through the door.

It wasn‚Äôt perfect. But it was *theirs*.



# Chapter 3: The Night of the Catalyst

Then came the storm.

It was late September when thunder rolled across Lake Ontario. The sky turned violet, and a shimmering mist descended over Brockport like glittering rain. It wasn‚Äôt ordinary ‚Äî it *hummed*, like invisible music vibrating in the air.

The Catalyst had arrived.

Lila woke up at 2 a.m., hearing faint echoes ‚Äî notes, whispers, rhythms she didn‚Äôt understand. Her walls seemed to hum with sound.

Maya dreamed of standing in a choir of light, her voice stretching beyond galaxies.

Harper jolted awake to find her phone speaker pulsing ‚Äî but no music was playing.

Then silence.



# Chapter 4: The Morning After

The next morning, everything changed.

‚ÄúTry humming something,‚Äù Harper said at breakfast, staring at Lila.

Lila hesitated. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù

So she sang ‚Äî just a simple note.

But the walls *vibrated*. The sound was pure, ethereal, and layered, like a choir behind her voice. Her dog howled in tune.

Maya joined in, harmonizing effortlessly, her tone expanding and multiplying in ways she never imagined.

Then Harper added her rock-grit voice ‚Äî and the sound shook the kitchen window.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù Harper blinked. ‚ÄúDid we just auto-tune reality?‚Äù

Lila gasped. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt. The *Catalyst* did.‚Äù



# Chapter 5: Voices of the Catalyst

Over the next week, their powers grew stronger.

* **Lila** could mimic any voice ‚Äî male, female, alien, or robotic. Her tone could shift between instruments, making her a one-woman orchestra.
* **Maya** could sing in frequencies that healed small wounds and calm anger. Her lullabies could stop fights and mend heartbreak.
* **Harper** could amplify emotion through sound ‚Äî turning whispers into earthquakes or screams into light.

Their voices were no longer human. They were *mutant.*

When they sang together, something even stranger happened: the air shimmered with color, light forming around them in waves.

One night, a stranger in a black coat appeared after a performance at the Brockport Arts Caf√©.

He clapped slowly. ‚ÄúImpressive. You girls realize you‚Äôre not just talented. You‚Äôre *activated*.‚Äù

‚ÄúActivated?‚Äù Maya asked.

The man revealed a badge ‚Äî **S.H.I.E.L.D.**

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Agent Daniel Reyes. We‚Äôve been tracking the Catalyst mutation since it reached Western New York. You‚Äôre the first trio to manifest auditory resonance powers.‚Äù

Harper crossed her arms. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what, we‚Äôre mutants now? Gonna throw us in some lab?‚Äù

Reyes smiled faintly. ‚ÄúNo. But you‚Äôre about to be very famous ‚Äî and very targeted.‚Äù



# Chapter 6: Stardom and Shadows

Their fame skyrocketed overnight.  
Within months, **The Songbirds** became an internet sensation. Their first single, *‚ÄúCatalyst Hearts‚Äù*, went viral ‚Äî not just because of their music, but because people *felt* it. Their songs stirred memories, tears, and even healing in hospitals.

They signed a deal in New York City. Then came the world tour ‚Äî from NYC to L.A., Tokyo to Paris.

Crowds wept during Maya‚Äôs solos. Lila‚Äôs voice could imitate instruments perfectly, and Harper‚Äôs energy electrified stadiums.

But with fame came danger.

Mutant extremists, anti-mutant politicians, and shadowy organizations wanted them ‚Äî either as weapons or symbols.

One night in Las Vegas, a mutant calling himself **Echoflare** attacked their concert, claiming he was ‚Äúthe true voice of The Catalyst.‚Äù His screams shattered glass.

Lila stood firm on stage, singing a counter-frequency ‚Äî her voice clashing with his like thunder. Harper amplified the sound, and Maya used her soothing tones to calm panicked fans.

They fought back ‚Äî *with harmony.*



# Chapter 7: The Siren Awakening

After the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. revealed the truth: their mutation wasn‚Äôt random. The Catalyst had chosen them because of their emotional synchronization ‚Äî their *bond.*

Together, their combined voices formed something ancient ‚Äî a **Siren Trinity**, a power that legends said once existed in Atlantis.

Nick Fury himself visited their headquarters.

‚ÄúYou three have something the world needs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUnity. Strength. Music that heals instead of destroys.‚Äù

Harper smirked. ‚ÄúSo what, you want us on the Avengers playlist?‚Äù

Fury grinned. ‚ÄúNot yet. But when the time comes ‚Äî the world will need more than heroes. It‚Äôll need hope.‚Äù



# Chapter 8: Harmony Across the World

Years passed. The Songbirds became more than musicians. They founded the **Catalyst Harmony Foundation**, using their voices to calm riots, aid disaster zones, and bring peace in war-torn regions.

But they never forgot where it started ‚Äî the small town of Brockport.

Every year, they returned to their high school to perform for the next generation.

As the sun set behind the Erie Canal, the three stood on stage, holding hands.

Maya whispered, ‚ÄúWe never asked for powers.‚Äù

Lila smiled. ‚ÄúNo. But we used them right.‚Äù

Harper raised her mic. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll keep singing until the world learns to listen.‚Äù

The crowd cheered.

And as their voices rose into the night sky, the stars seemed to shimmer ‚Äî in perfect harmony.

Got about 280k invested across four different accounts right now. When I started getting serious about this two years ago I built this massive spreadsheet to track everything, I'm talking tabs for each account, formulas calculating my savings rate, projections based on different return scenarios, the whole nine yards.

Spent hours every week updating it. Like I'd sit down Saturday morning with coffee and go through each brokerage statement line by line. Kind of became my weekend ritual. I felt productive even though deep down I knew it was taking way too much time.

Then about six months ago I had this moment where I stepped back and realized I was tracking all this data but not really learning anything useful from it. My spreadsheet told me my net worth went up or down but I couldn't actually see patterns or understand what was working and what wasn't.

The breaking point was when I tried to figure out if my returns were beating the market. Spent three hours trying to calculate it properly and still wasn't sure if I did the math right. That's when I knew something had to change.

I still use notion for my main planning stuff but I stopped trying to track everything manually. Found a few tools that handle the calculation part automatically so I can actually focus on the decisions instead of the data entry. Still check my progress but now it's like once a week for ten minutes instead of hours of spreadsheet work.

My advice for anyone starting the fire journey is don't fall in love with your tracking system. The goal is financial independence not becoming an excel expert. Track what matters and automate the rest.

Anyone else go through a phase where tracking became more important than actual progress?",0,1761146061.0,Fire,12,0.46,False

Okay, let's talk about the pumpkin spice latte phenomenon for a second. You know the drill - the moment September hits, it's like the entire internet collectively decides that everything needs to be pumpkin spice flavored. Coffee? Obviously. Candles? Sure. Dog treats? Why not. Deodorant? Apparently that's a thing now.

But here's the thing that's actually pretty cool: all those ""basic"" pumpkin spice latte lovers might be onto something. That magical blend that makes everyone go crazy for their morning latte? It's actually incredible when you start using it in actual cooking.

**What's your experience?** Have you tried cooking with pumpkin spice beyond the pumpkin spice latte? What's the most surprising place you've used it that actually worked?

**For our Recipe Boss community:**

* What's your favorite pumpkin spice recipe discovery?
* Have you tried any of the pumpkin spice recipes in the app?
* What's the weirdest ingredient you've successfully paired with pumpkin spice?

*If you're curious about the science, psychology, and actual recipes behind this fall obsession, there's a comprehensive guide* [*here*](https://www.recipeboss.app/article/pumpkin-spice-versatility-beyond-latte) *that goes way beyond the basic latte.*",1,1761145951.0,recipebossapp,0,1.0,False

1odaz45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odaz45,What curtains for living/dining room?,"Hi there, I got Gemini to help me with images for floor-to-ceiling track curtains on my living/dining room wall. I'm going for mostly a scandi/japandi aesthetic with some mid-century accents and some coziness. Goal is that its bright/airy at day without feeling sterile at night. **As of right now, my instincts are that the flax/oatmeal curtain (Pic 3) would be the best bet.** The ivory seems perhaps a bit too bland (2), the camel might be a warmer alternate (5).

Curious if it clashes with my greige couch? (EQ3 Panama Fabric). Note my rug beside the coffee table, that is a burgundy/navy/orange persian rug, thats why we played with dark colours as well.

The rug is pic 1 in this post (with better daylight view of couch):

I let them rest a month before opening and have been following their [brewing recommendations](https://flowerchildcoffee.com/blogs/brewing-tips-guides-extrapolation/brew-guides) (brewing hot and fine in a 1:18 ratio), and there just isn't much flavor at all. Just very boring cups that honestly aren't much better than a Nespresso pod. I have gotten the best results out of the Gesha (good, but no better than a bean from anywhere else), but the Pink Bourbon and Chelbessa are not expressive at all and have no standout flavors. Since the brewer recs weren't hitting, I have tried some of my go-to methods -- 4:6 on the V60, aeropress, part-immersion on the Switch, and the results haven't been any better. It's honestly killed my usual excitement around the morning coffee and I'm just slogging through to get to the 2 Hydrangea bags I have resting.

I feel like the usual recommendations for muted brews is to go hotter, finer and longer to increase extraction, but I have pretty much maxed out those avenues. Any ideas (or has anyone else experienced similar challenges)?

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music.

I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do.

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf!

I've come to find a lot of peace in the hours of solitude; however, my peacefulness is often mistaken for indifference. Hence, why I'm here. I live deliberately: work hard, train consistently, read regularly, and I try to make every action align with who I aspire to be. Stoicism shapes a lot of that. I believe quality of character matters more than comfort.

I own my home, work long rotating shifts at a mill, and spend most of my free time in the gym or building things ‚Äî physically and mentally. I‚Äôm the type who finds beauty in order, meaning in effort, and calm in doing what‚Äôs right even when it‚Äôs difficult.

I‚Äôve had my share of pain, loss, and false starts, but I‚Äôd rather grow from them rather than run. I‚Äôm not looking for perfection ‚Äî just someone who values honesty, effort, and a certain stillness in life. Someone who doesn‚Äôt mistake discipline for coldness.

A bit about my hobbies and interests:

I read and study Stoicism daily  
I also go to the gym daily (I'm currently around 10% BF)   
Strict dieting and macro tracking (and meal prep, I actually enjoy doing this)   
I love coffee and make my own fancy schmancy coffees  
Cafe chess games are a love of mine!  
Nightly Bonfires in some warm lighting!  
Also, random sidequests. I assure you, very few manage to find sidequests as random as I do. It's not even intentional, but I love it!  
I make my own music!

1odara9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1odara9/help_me_rationalize_my_situation/,Help me rationalize my situation,"I've been suffering from GERD since my mid-twenties (now in my thirties). It's always been fairly mild, and I've been treating it with PPIs for as long as I can remember. About three months ago, I started getting what you'd call 'globus' sensation, along with some nausea.

As time has gone on, the feeling of something in my throat just continued to get worse. It now feels like a significant pressure behind my trachea that I keep thinking is trapped gas, so I'm belching constantly to relieve the pressure, but nothing works. I feel it the moment I wake up and it's the last thing I feel before I go to bed.

At the two-month mark, I started getting back and flank pain. This stopped for about a week after starting sucralfate but came back with a vengeance and is now worse than ever. Very recently, I've been getting throat irritation and the urge to cough.

So far, I have tried:

* Quitting coffee.
* Eating mild foods
* Sleeping with a wedge pillow
* Switched from pantoprazole to rabeprazole
* Switched from 1x rabeprazole 20mg per day, to 2x
* Sucralfate before meals
* Gaviscon Advance (used to work and buy me a few hours of comfort, but now less so)

Both my PCP and Gastroenterologist are convinced it's just a bad GERD flare up. I had an endoscopy in 2023, and a full abdominal CT scan in 2024, so they are adamant that the testing that needs to be done has already been done.

In my decade or so of GERD, it's never felt like this. The persistence and progression of symptoms has me convinced that there's something else going on, so I'm contemplating paying for a private endoscopy.

I'm wondering how much this sounds like GERD to other long-time sufferers. Am I just reaching a new level of severity that I've never experienced before? I'm stuck trying to rationalize paying significant money for a private scope vs. just listening to my doctors and waiting it out.

1odaq2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1odaq2v/aita_for_exposing_my_fathers_affair_to_my_entire/,AITA for exposing my father's affair to my entire family after my parents called me their 'practice child' at my sister's wedding?,"My parents stood up at my sister's wedding reception and told 200 people I was their ""practice child"" and that they finally got it right with her.

I'm 32. My sister is 28. We grew up in the same house but lived completely different childhoods. She got piano lessons, college funds, family vacations. I got a mattress on the floor and permission to work at 14 so I could buy my own clothes.

But that's not even the worst part.

The worst part is what my father did when I was 16, and how my mother helped him cover it up. And now, after that speech at the wedding, I made sure everyone knew.

Let me back up. The wedding was three weeks ago. Beautiful venue, expensive everything. My parents paid for all of it. They didn't contribute a dollar to my courthouse wedding six years ago, but that's beside the point.

During the toasts, my father got up. He was already drunk. He started talking about how they learned so much from raising me. ""Trial and error,"" he called it. Then he laughed and said they were glad they had a second chance to do it right.

My mother nodded along. Smiled. Raised her glass.

My sister looked uncomfortable but didn't say anything. Her new husband laughed. Other people laughed too.

I sat there feeling like I was 16 again, invisible and worthless.

My husband grabbed my hand under the table. ""We can leave,"" he whispered.

But I didn't leave. I stayed through dinner. I smiled for photos. I hugged my sister and congratulated her. Then I went home and made a decision.

See, when I was 16, I walked in on my father with my mother's best friend. They were in my parents' bedroom. The door wasn't even fully closed. My father saw me standing there. We locked eyes for maybe three seconds.

Later that night, he came to my room. He sat on the edge of my bed and said, ""You didn't see anything today.""

I said, ""But I did.""

He said, ""No. You didn't. And if you tell your mother, I'll make sure she knows this is your fault. I'll tell her you've been acting inappropriately around me. Who do you think she'll believe?""

I was 16 years old. I didn't tell anyone.

My mother's best friend kept coming over for coffee. Family barbecues. Christmas dinners. My mother had no idea. And I carried that secret for 16 years because I was terrified.

But after that speech at the wedding, something snapped.

I spent a week writing everything down. Not just the affair. Everything. How they gave my sister a new car for her 16th birthday and told me cars were earned, not given. How they paid for her sorority dues but refused to cosign my student loans. How my father told me I was too stupid for college anyway. How my mother said I was dramatic when I asked why they treated us differently.

I wrote about walking in on the affair. My father's threat. How I stayed silent because I was scared. How I watched my mother stay friends with that woman for years, completely oblivious.

Then I sent it. Not just to my parents. To everyone. Every family member on their contact list. My sister. Her husband. My aunts and uncles. Cousins. Family friends. Even my mother's best friend, the one my father cheated with.

Subject line: ""Why I Was the Practice Child.""

My phone started ringing within an hour. First my mother. Then my father. Then my sister. I didn't answer.

My mother left a voicemail screaming that I was a liar. That I was jealous. That I was trying to ruin their lives out of spite.

My father sent a text: ""You have no proof. This will blow over.""

My sister called me selfish. Said I ruined her wedding memories. Said I was bitter and couldn't let her have one good thing.

But other people reached out too. My aunt on my mother's side said she always suspected something was wrong with how they treated me. My cousin said he was sorry he didn't notice. Even one of my mother's friends admitted she always thought the favoritism was extreme.

My mother's best friend didn't respond at all. But two days later, my mother called her and apparently she didn't deny it. Just hung up.

My parents are now separated. My mother moved in with her sister. My father is staying in the house. My sister isn't speaking to me. Half the family thinks I'm vindictive. The other half thinks my parents got what they deserved.

My husband says I did the right thing. That they humiliated me publicly so I had every right to tell the truth publicly.

But I keep thinking about my sister's face in the family photo someone sent me from the wedding. She looks so happy. And I took that away from her.

My therapist says I was protecting myself. That I spent years carrying their shame and I had the right to put it down.

I don't know. I just know I'm tired of being the practice child. The failed experiment. The one who didn't matter.

Was I wrong to blow up their entire lives just because they made a cruel joke?

I‚Äôm always switching between US news, UK football, CA sitcoms, and EU documentaries, so I need something that can keep up. Here‚Äôs how my top five [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) contenders stacked up after months of channel-hopping.

# 1. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (discounts if you pick a longer subscription)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (covers US, UK, Canada, EU, and more)
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (streams are usually smooth‚Äîeven on big US or UK sports nights)
* **My experience:** I first tested IPTVMEZZY after a recommendation from a UK [**iptv reseller**](https://iptvmeezzy.blogspot.com/2025/10/gridiron-glory-and-silver-screen.html). Starting with the **best iptv trial** was easy, and I was honestly surprised by how many channels worked reliably. I‚Äôve watched everything from live Canadian hockey to late-night French films. Even during peak hours, buffering was a rare sight in my living room.

# 2. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $15/month (or less if you commit to a yearly plan)
* **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (excellent coverage of US, UK, CA, EU)
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (very stable, with only minor hiccups on the busiest weekends)
* **My experience:** XXIPTV was a real ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù winner for me. I picked it up after seeing a Canadian review about their sports coverage. The channel list is big, but more importantly, most of the streams actually work. Whether I‚Äôm watching US late shows or UK documentaries, the transition is quick, and the interface is easy to learn.

# 3. [Aurorastreaming](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (UK/EU-focused, but strong US/CA support)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (a few stutters during EU football finals, but great for binge-watching)
* **My experience:** Aurorastreaming is my go-to for lazy weekends. Their VOD section is packed with classic UK comedies and EU series. Most of the time, everything runs smoothly, though I did hit some buffering during a major UK football match. Still, the selection keeps me coming back.

# 4. GlobalPlay IPTV

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 20,000+ live, 60,000+ VOD (mix of US/UK/CA, with a splash of EU)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (reliable for daily use, but live events in the US or CA can test its limits)
* **My experience:** GlobalPlay is the ‚Äúbackground TV‚Äù champ in my house‚Äîperfect for US morning news or Canadian weather while I cook. The EU content is a bonus, though not the main draw. The sign-up process for their [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://xxiptv.top/) was straightforward, and the EPG is easy to navigate.

# 5. StreamEra TV

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 15,500+ live, 44,500+ VOD (core US/UK/CA/EU content)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (expect slowdowns during major live events, especially in Europe)
* **My experience:** StreamEra TV is my fallback for when I just want background noise‚Äîthink US sitcoms, British panel shows, or French news. Their **iptv reseller** platform looks simple enough, but I haven‚Äôt tried it myself. For casual streaming, it gets the job done.

# Some IPTV Lessons From My Year of Streaming

* **Always test with the best iptv trial**‚Äîwhat works for my setup in Canada might act differently in the UK or EU.
* Massive channel lists are fun, but in reality, I stick to the same 15 or so favorites.
* Even with [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) services, major live events (especially in the EU) can cause buffering or short outages.
* If you‚Äôre thinking about being an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/), be prepared for lots of tech questions from friends and family.
* Using a VPN is a smart move for privacy and sometimes results in smoother streams.

Between bills, subscriptions, groceries, and those ""just this once"" purchases that somehow happen every week, keeping track of where your money goes is exhausting. You promise yourself you'll start budgeting next month, but next month never quite arrives.

Sound familiar?

If you've been searching for a way to get your finances under control without needing an accounting degree or spending hours with complicated apps, there's good news. The¬†**Smart Things Personal Monthly Budget Template**¬†is here to transform the way you handle money and it's surprisingly simple.

**Why Most People Struggle with Budgeting**

Before we dive into the solution, let's talk about why budgeting feels so hard. Most people don't fail at budgeting because they're bad with money they fail because:

* **Traditional methods are time-consuming.**¬†Who has time to manually calculate every expense?
* **Budgeting apps are overcomplicated.**¬†Too many features, subscriptions, and learning curves.
* **There's no clear visual feedback.**¬†Numbers in a notebook don't show you the bigger picture.
* **It feels like punishment.**¬†Budgeting shouldn't feel restrictive it should feel empowering.

If you have question or something feel free to ask below, Thanks !

Hey everyone,New parcel 9 items, received in 10 days via rocket express ! Everything arrived perfectly packed and in great condition.
Feel free to share your thoughts and opinions about the pieces üëáFor reference: I‚Äôm 1m82 / 72kg


‚ú¶ Nocta gym shirt
 Size: M / Price: ¬•207 
This is a great Nocta compression shirt, I love it! I‚Äôve already worn it for two workouts and it‚Äôs super comfortable. The fit is perfect, the details are beautiful, and the panels and finishing are really cool. Regarding the size, you could maybe size up for a bit more comfort, but it fits well even when going TTS (True To Size). Let me know in the comments if you'd be interested in a post about my sportswear collection. 

‚ú¶ Supreme 7 polo shirt 
Size: M / Price: ¬•210
 High-quality polo. The details and the ""7"" embroidery are very clean, with no loose threads. The fit is slightly oversized, just enough for a relaxed look without being too baggy. What I particularly like is the collar, which is thicker and stiffer than the rest of the polo, giving it a great structure and a premium feel. The cotton is nice to the touch; it's a simple and effective piece that I fully approve of. Go TTS for this fit.


‚ú¶ CDG 2001 long sleeve 
Size: M / Price: ¬•165 
This is my favorite piece from the haul, so much so that I'm thinking of ordering the black colorway too. I just love the design, which I find original and well-executed‚Äîyou don't see it everywhere. The screen-printed details and topstitching are beautiful, and the fit is exactly what I wanted! It's oversized but hits right below the waistband in length. The cotton is thick and comfortable. In short, I have nothing bad to say about it. Go TTS.


‚ú¶ Stone Island crewneck 
Size: M / Price: ¬•200
 I have mixed feelings about this beautiful Stone Island sweater. In terms of quality‚Äîthe cotton, fabric, and finishings‚Äîeverything is well-made and on point. The collar, cuffs, and waistband are nicely fitted. I compared it to a retail piece, and the material feels the same. However, the badge seems just okay to me; in my opinion, it still looks different from the retail one. The other downside is the sizing: it's too tight on me. I strongly recommend sizing up once, because apart from that, this piece is definitely worth it! 

‚ú¶ Mutimer Knit 
Size: M / Price: ¬•295
 Starting strong with this beautiful knit I got for my dad. He instantly liked it when I showed him, and honestly, after seeing it on him, I might grab one for myself soon. The knit is a mix of acrylic, mohair, and a bit of wool, which makes it elastic, warm, and very comfortable. The color is stunning, a bright red with gold embroidery that looks super clean. The collar and finishings are top-notch. My dad absolutely loves it! Sizing tip: it runs a bit large, so consider sizing down if you want a less oversized fit. 

‚ú¶ Supreme x bb simon zip up hoodie
 Size: M / Price: ¬•400 
One of the best quality zip-ups I've ever owned, by far. It's a collab I've been dreaming of, but the retail price was just too much. So, a big thank you to the seller for making this. I can't compare it to retail, so to all the experts out there, I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments. But in terms of quality, finishing, details, and fit, it's all there! I love the rhinestones stitched onto the branding embroidery and the details under the hood. It's definitely a bold piece, but one that really makes an outfit stand out! 

‚ú¶ K-two studios knit black & coffee brown 
Size: L for both / Price: ¬•300 
The second major banger of this haul. I couldn't decide which colorway to get, so I bought both. It's a great alternative to retail and totally worth it; I compared it with a friend's retail piece, and the quality is the same. The fit is incredible‚Äîsize up once for a boxy fit in width with long sleeves (it's designed to run a bit small). I do have a slight preference for the black/washed grey one, as it's easier to pair with all my outfits, haha. It's both comfortable and warm, perfect for winter.


‚ú¶ Akimbo Hoodie Charcoal 
Size: L / Price: ¬•200 
Last item of this small haul, the second piece I got for my dad. This one‚Äôs more lowkey: a warm hoodie for daily wear or casual outings. He immediately liked it when I showed him, and I can see why. The inner cotton is thick and fleeced, super comfy to wear. The dark grey color is nice and simple, and the hood is double-layered and soft. Definitely a must-have comfort piece. Sizing: True to size, but size up for a more oversized look.

1odakwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1odakwy/aio_adults_bullying_me_for_no_reason/,AIO? Adults bullying me for no reason,"Hi everyone, sorry this is long, but I need some honest advice. I‚Äôm in my early 20s and have volunteered as a youth competitive cheerleading coach for the past three years at the same school I once cheered at. Our season started in March and ends next month. I almost didn‚Äôt coach again this year because, if you know, you know. cheer parents can be a lot but I decided to do it because I genuinely love the sport and these kids.

Our organization has multiple teams by age level. This year, I coach with two new coaches who just joined our district. One is in her late 30s and has children on our team; the other is around my age, and they‚Äôre cousins. At first, things were great, we clicked, had similar coaching styles, and even hung out outside of cheer. I don‚Äôt have many local friends, so I thought maybe the reason I came back this season was to meet them and build friendships. I even invited the younger one to a concert over the summer (my treat), and we had a great time. I always tried to be thoughtful, bringing coffee to practice, small gifts for the coach‚Äôs kids, asking about their lives. But I started noticing that effort wasn‚Äôt mutual.

The older coach started acting weirdly distant. I‚Äôd post about our team and tag both of them and she wouldn‚Äôt like or comment, even though she and her cousin would post ‚Äúmy team this, my team that,‚Äù and everyone else, including other coaches, would engage with them. It hurt because I‚Äôve been with this organization for three years, while they‚Äôre new, and I‚Äôve done so much for the team like organizing practice wear, creating our music (which took me over 20 hours), choreographing routines, and handling scheduling. I‚Äôve poured my heart into it, but I‚Äôve received zero recognition.

This season has been stressful because of parent drama, and we‚Äôve all vented about it in our group chat, even talking about frustrations with other teams‚Äô coaches in the organization. So, when I started to feel iced out, it really threw me.

Here‚Äôs where it really went downhill: We had to pick two team moms for the season. I wanted to keep the same ones from last year because they were amazing, but one of them caused problems early on, so we decided to replace her. I assumed the coach with kids would tell her (since they were still friendly), but she didn‚Äôt. Later, that mom made amends and was being kind again, so we decided to let her help in other ways to stay included. She didn‚Äôt get a team mom badge because I‚Äôd already submitted the new names, but we planned to make her a shirt so she could still feel part of things.

Fast-forward to last Friday, we had a fundraiser and curling party. I couldn‚Äôt go because of work, but I made goodie bags and gave them to my co-coach to hand out. Turns out, she never did. That same day, after another round of parent complaints, I texted our coach group chat saying, ‚ÄúIf they keep being disrespectful, I‚Äôm probably not coming back after this competition.‚Äù Normally we all say things like that when we‚Äôre frustrated, but this time‚Ä¶ no one responded.

The next day was competition day. We were supposed to meet at 11 a.m. I got there at 11:05, waited outside for our junior coaches to give them their badges, and walked in around 11:15. We weren‚Äôt competing until 12:30. My phone was on silent, so I missed a few calls and texts from my co-coach. When I finally checked my phone, I had a message from the team mom without a badge saying she was leaving because my co-coaches told her I was the reason she didn‚Äôt get one.

When I walked in, the team moms and other coaches made snarky comments like, ‚ÄúOh, we weren‚Äôt sure if you were coming.‚Äù I was shocked, I‚Äôve never missed a competition in three years. I confronted my co-coaches, and they denied blaming me, but the coach with kids got nasty, raising her voice in front of everyone. I told her not to talk to me like that, said I was handling our junior coaches, and walked away because it wasn‚Äôt the time or place for a fight.

Later, the team mom who didn‚Äôt get the badge came to me in tears, saying my co-coach had also been rude to her and made her feel unwelcome. I comforted her as best I could, but it was awful.

After that, everyone including coaches I‚Äôve known longer than these two, completely ignored me. Not one person said hello or even looked at me. At practice the following week, the same thing happened. They even had a team meeting while I was in the bathroom and changed part of our routine without my input.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where this is affecting my sleep, my focus, and my happiness. I work full-time, go to school full-time, and coach purely out of passion. I love these kids like they‚Äôre my own, and I hate the thought of leaving them mid-season, but this environment has become toxic. I don‚Äôt want to let them ‚Äúwin‚Äù or make it seem like I gave up, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep showing up somewhere that makes me feel small and excluded.

Am I being dramatic, or do I have a real reason to feel hurt? Should I try to push through the last month or just step away for my peace?",1,1761145054.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1odakjf,https://i.redd.it/ith48dwldowf1.png,Caffeine Sensitivity and Your Genes,"Genes determine how quickly your body processes and eliminates caffeine, and also whether it is likely to make you jittery or anxious.

The CYP1A2 gene encodes the¬†**enzyme**¬†that breaks down caffeine. Other drugs can also be broken down with the CYP1A2 gene (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, theophylline), so be careful with drinking a lot of caffeine with certain medications.\[[ref](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/issue/2007/2007-11/2007-11-8279)\]

People with genetic variants in the CYP1A2 gene usually break down caffeine more slowly, causing them to feel the effects of caffeine longer. Without the variants, you‚Äôll break down caffeine quickly and may not notice the alerting effects as much or for as long.

If your beverage of choice in the morning is coffee, here are some studies on the effects:

* A meta-analysis study showed that coffee consumption (4 cups a day) **decreased the risk** of breast cancer in postmenopausal women by 10%.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360766)\] Another study indicates that the reduction in risk (found to be closer to 30% for those drinking 5 cups a day) may be due to something else in coffee other than caffeine, because other caffeinated drinks did not give the same result.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530639?dopt=Abstract)\]
* For those with the BRCA1 mutation, one study found that coffee consumption before age 35 for those with the C-allele **reduced their risk of breast cancer by 64%**.\[[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507615)\]

1odajod,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1odajod/general_knowledge_class_1_sindhi_medium_free_pdf/,General Knowledge Class 1 Sindhi Medium FREE PDF - Sindh Textbook Board,"### Beyond Textbooks: My Thoughts on 'Whispers in the Gloom' (Plus a Free PDF for General Knowledge!)

Hey everyone! I just finished reading ""Whispers in the Gloom"" by [Fictional Author Name - e.g., A. B. Thorne], and I'm genuinely excited to share my thoughts. This book has been quite the journey, and I feel like I've expanded my 'general knowledge' of human nature and suspense through its pages. Speaking of learning new things, if you're ever looking for foundational knowledge in a different area, you might find this [General Knowledge Class 1 Sindhi Medium FREE PDF - Sindh Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/general-knowledge-class-1-sindhi-medium-free-pdf-sindh-textbook-board/) quite useful as a starting point. But back to the book!

""Whispers in the Gloom"" dives deep into the life of Elara, a woman haunted by a mysterious disappearance from her past. When strange occurrences begin to mirror those old, unsettling events, Elara finds herself pulled into a chilling quest for truth, unsure if she's losing her mind or if a sinister force is truly at play. It's a psychological thriller that keeps you guessing, blurring the lines between reality and delusion, all without giving away any major plot points.

### What Really Stood Out For Me

**The Characters:** Oh, the characters! Elara is wonderfully complex. She's not a perfect hero; she's flawed, vulnerable, and her inner struggles really resonate. I found myself rooting for her, even when she made choices that had me biting my nails. The secondary characters also felt real, each with their own secrets and motives, making the web of mystery even thicker. You really get inside their heads, which is key for a good psychological thriller.

**The Writing Style and Pacing:** The author has a knack for creating atmosphere. Every description, every whispered word, builds a sense of dread and unease. The writing is smooth and engaging, pulling you along without feeling rushed. The pacing starts off steadily, allowing you to settle into the mystery, but then it slowly, almost imperceptibly, ratchets up the tension. By the last third of the book, I couldn't put it down. It was a proper page-turner!

**The Emotional Rollercoaster:** This book truly took me on an emotional ride. There were moments of genuine fear, deep empathy for Elara's struggles, and sheer frustration when clues seemed to lead nowhere. It‚Äôs the kind of book that stays with you long after you've turned the final page, making you ponder the nature of memory, truth, and the unseen forces that might shape our lives.

### Any Downsides?

If I had to pick something, perhaps the very beginning felt a *tad* slow for my personal taste. It takes a little while for the central mystery to fully unfold. However, looking back, I think this slow burn was actually intentional and effective, serving to build the atmosphere and ground the characters before the real psychological twists began. It's a very minor point, and certainly didn't detract from my overall enjoyment.

### Would I Recommend It?

Absolutely! If you love psychological thrillers, mysteries, or anything that makes you question what's real, then ""Whispers in the Gloom"" is definitely for you. It's perfect for anyone who enjoys a story with strong character development, an immersive atmosphere, and a plot that keeps you guessing until the very end.

### A Few Tips for New Readers (Or Anyone Looking for a Next Read!)

Reading should be an enjoyable escape, and sometimes it can feel a bit daunting to start a new book or even a reading habit. Here are some simple steps and tips I've picked up over the years:

1.  **Just Start!** Don't overthink your first book choice. Pick something that genuinely catches your eye, whether it's the cover, the blurb, or a friend's recommendation.
2.  **It's Okay to Stop:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, don't feel guilty about putting it down. Life's too short for books you don't enjoy! There are so many amazing stories out there.
3.  **Read a Little Bit Every Day:** Even 10-15 minutes can make a big difference. It could be during your commute, before bed, or with your morning coffee. Consistency is key.
4.  **Explore Different Genres:** You might surprise yourself! Sometimes what you think you won't like becomes your next favorite. Expanding your reading horizons is a bit like expanding your general knowledge; you never know what you'll find useful or interesting. For instance, if you're curious about foundational learning, check out this [General Knowledge Class 1 Sindhi Medium FREE PDF - Sindh Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/general-knowledge-class-1-sindhi-medium-free-pdf-sindh-textbook-board/).
5.  **Join a Community:** Talking about books with others, whether online or in person, can deepen your appreciation and expose you to new titles.

Remember, reading is a journey, not a race. There's no ""right"" way to do it. The most important thing is to enjoy the process and let stories transport you to new worlds and perspectives. Every book you read, no matter how short or simple, broadens your world and gives you a bit more ""general knowledge"" about life.

Thanks for reading my thoughts! I hope this helps some of you find your next great read. And remember, learning comes in all forms, whether it's through a thrilling story or something more academic like this [General Knowledge Class 1 Sindhi Medium FREE PDF - Sindh Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/general-knowledge-class-1-sindhi-medium-free-pdf-sindh-textbook-board/).

We have a spacious room available in a three-bedroom apartment in Bushwick, on the same block as Rosie‚Äôs Pizza Bar.The room is unfurnished and includes a generous built-in wardrobe. It‚Äôs not a bright room, but it‚Äôs quiet and cool, perfect for sleeping in or escaping the summer heat. The apartment also has basement storage and a backyard that‚Äôs great for morning coffee or a few drinks on warm evenings.

Rent is $1,200 per month, plus $50 for electricity and $23.33 for internet. Heating usually comes to around $150 during winter. You‚Äôll share a bathroom with one other person.

You‚Äôll be living with two professionals in our 30s, both male and both gay. We work Monday to Friday, keep regular hours, and like a calm home. It‚Äôs not a party or afters spot. The walls are thin and we‚Äôre early risers, so we try to keep things peaceful during the week.

I‚Äôm 30 and work full-time in operations for a tech company in FiDi. I‚Äôm usually up around 5:30 or 6 and out the door by 7. I go to bed early enough so I‚Äôm not half-alive the next morning. I have an active social life and meet friends for drinks a few nights a week, but I always come in quietly and respectfully.

I like a friendly, easygoing home where everyone gets along but still has space to recharge. I read a lot, love museums, film, and theatre, and I‚Äôm always up for a chat, a laugh, or a glass of wine when our schedules line up. The place is clean and organized without being precious about it ‚Äî just a comfortable, pleasant space to come home to.

This is a pet-free home, and smoking is fine outside. The lease is for 12 months, for the room itself. References and a good credit score are required.

Between bills, subscriptions, groceries, and those ""just this once"" purchases that somehow happen every week, keeping track of where your money goes is exhausting. You promise yourself you'll start budgeting next month, but next month never quite arrives.

Sound familiar?

If you've been searching for a way to get your finances under control without needing an accounting degree or spending hours with complicated apps, there's good news. The¬†**Smart Things Personal Monthly Budget Template**¬†is here to transform the way you handle money and it's surprisingly simple.

**Why Most People Struggle with Budgeting**

Before we dive into the solution, let's talk about why budgeting feels so hard. Most people don't fail at budgeting because they're bad with money they fail because:

* **Traditional methods are time-consuming.**¬†Who has time to manually calculate every expense?
* **Budgeting apps are overcomplicated.**¬†Too many features, subscriptions, and learning curves.
* **There's no clear visual feedback.**¬†Numbers in a notebook don't show you the bigger picture.
* **It feels like punishment.**¬†Budgeting shouldn't feel restrictive it should feel empowering.

What if managing your money could actually be straightforward, visual, and even satisfying?

**Enter the Smart Things Personal Monthly Budget Template**

1odafo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiboSuccessStories/comments/1odafo6/90_cured_through_natural_antimicriobals/,90% cured through natural antimicriobals,"I‚Äôve been wanting to make this post for awhile. A quick summary I took a couple of antibiotics in 2022, tested positive for SIBO early 2023‚Ä¶Xifaxan helped for about a year. Relapsed throughout 2024 into early 2025. Took another breath test in March which was positive for both Methane and Hydrogen. Decided I needed to come up with a plan that was low and slow (something most people on these forums don‚Äôt have the patience to try).

Symptoms: Bloating, constipation, noticed I never farted ever lol, eye issues, skin issues, fatigue, brain fog, food intolerances, histamine intolerances which would turn into full body rashes after flare ups.

Tools that helped a ton: 

-Ancestry DNA raw data uploaded to genetic lifehacks. This is what helped me realize I slightly impaired methylation and a DAO deficiency. Basically in a nutshell is my body has a hard time on its own processing histamine along with needing support for methylation which helps detox and immune balance.

-Increasing motility in multiple ways. I take megaguard at 6am each morning. I do intermittent fasting and eat from about 12-8ish, no snacking. I take magnesium citramate at night. I drink coffee on an empty stomach (I know some with sensitive stomachs can‚Äôt do this so any type of tea is fine also). I went from going 2 times a week ish to about 5-6 times a week now.

-L-Glutamine, I‚Äôm about 5 months into this and plan on taking for another month at least. If you think you have any potential permeability or leaky gut symptoms look into this, I feel it‚Äôs done an amazing job in repair. I took Zinc L Carnosine for months also helping to heal. I take Creatine daily for cognitive function, mental focus, energy production.

-Digestive Enzymes. I‚Äôve been taking them for about a year now, I take Digest Gold by Enzymedica. I‚Äôm trying to eventually ween off of this and take only as needed. I actually take Histamine Digest as I have a DAO deficiency before heavy meals and it has helped with bad flare ups.

-Staying active. I don‚Äôt care what you do, if it‚Äôs going to the gym, cardio, casual sports, playing outside. Do it, move around, it also does wonders for motility which I still struggle with during the winter as we are always inside doing nothing.

-Getting out of constant fight or flight mode and into rest and digest mode. This one I still struggle with as I have bad anxiety but it needs to be said lol.

Antimicrobial protocol:

I‚Äôm sure this is all anyone is going to read lol.

- Allicin + Berberine Complex for 4-6 weeks.
-Allicin + Neem for about 2-4 weeks.

After that I took a break and it seemed like it brought my methane down. As always when you target your methane the hydrogen will still be there. I think tried something different and longer. Be sure to taper up and down very slowly.

-Berberine Complex + Atrantil for about 8-10 weeks.

After this I discontinued all anti microbials and have been focusing on repair,reinoculate, and rebalance.

I have been taking florastar everyday at night to help introduce beneficial bacteria. I realize it is simply working as a mercenary to crowd out the bad but it‚Äôs helping with the balancing act.

I do not take any other probiotics, kefir, kimchi etc‚Ä¶I‚Äôve heard horror stories and honestly am hesitant.

My goal is eating 30-40 veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds a week. I still do not eat most dairy as it causes flare ups and bloating. I‚Äôm trying to branch into new items with small quantities and it seems to be working so far. Example (if you love cheeseburgers, try half a regular hamburger see how you do, start small and work your way up). I try to eat gluten free when I can still, along with limiting dairy and sugar. Those items are obvious flare ups so if I do eat any it‚Äôs small and I spread it out.

For the record I still have occasional flare ups but they are becoming lesser and I can mostly control them and know how to help it.

Main take aways: Do a DNA kit, see if you have any deficiencies, if you do antimicriobals take it low and slow and mix and match as needed, focus on gut repair nutrients, and probably the most important is promote motility.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

There are several bodega on that stretch and they all seem to be particularly crappy/ small selection and I never see many people in them.

There is also an interior decoration business that has a great space, but seems like a really odd place for a store like that? And half the time its closed up?

I've been meaning to try Dough Girl, which seems like a bakery/coffee shop. Maybe its new but I also see 0 people in there when I pass by.

Then we have a realty office, again, weird spot for an office like that.

Cool looking hat/hair(?) store right next to it. Again, never once seen a soul in there.

For the local businesses mentioned here i hope they are all successful and will try to support. 

But this street just seems like wasted store fronts, businesses that would be more successful on another street with more foot traffic.

It's a beautiful street and there is nothing to actually do on the street.

Kilian Jornet was drenched and tired.

Mr. Jornet, 37, was just a few days into an ambitious odyssey,¬†[a self-designed project](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/31/style/kilian-jornet-states-of-elevation-14ers.html)¬†he had named ‚ÄúStates of Elevation.‚Äù His goal was to link, by foot and by bike, the tallest peaks in the contiguous United States ‚Äî a series of 70-plus publicly accessible mountains in Colorado, California and Washington known as the ‚Äú14ers‚Äù because they are all 14,000 feet or higher (symbolized on the map as¬†). He estimated it would take him around a month.

But now, in early September, Mr. Jornet wondered whether he could continue.

It is not often that Mr. Jornet, one of the most accomplished endurance athletes on the planet, seems susceptible to human frailties. In 2017, he reached the summit of Mount Everest¬†[twice in one week](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/kilian-jornet-mountain-runner), without support or supplemental oxygen. In 2023, he climbed the 177 tallest peaks in the Pyrenees in eight days. Last year, he needed just 19 days to tackle the 82 tallest peaks in the Alps.

But now, after a long flight from Norway, where he lives with his wife,¬†[Emelie Forsberg](https://www.instagram.com/tinaemelie/?hl=en), a former skyrunning world champion, and their three young daughters, Mr. Jornet was jet-lagged and struggling to acclimate to the high altitude of the LA Freeway in Colorado, a mountainous traverse along the Continental Divide.

Figuring out the correct gear was part of the puzzle when Kilian Jornet was planning his ‚ÄúStates of Elevation‚Äù project.

¬†

Nick Danielson

Making matters worse, a steady rain left him feeling as if he were soaked through to his core.

‚ÄúI just felt exhausted,‚Äù Mr. Jornet recalled in a recent interview. ‚ÄúIt felt impossible to do one more week, let alone another month. But then the body switched, and I went from fighting to adapting.‚Äù

Climbing peak after peak in Colorado, he seemed to grow stronger as he moved west, through the Mojave Desert and into the Sierra Nevada, across Northern California and finally into the Cascades.

A small support crew in a recreational vehicle met up with Mr. Jornet periodically while he was hiking, and followed more closely during his long bike rides. He also had a rotating cast of friends and fellow athletes who joined him for parts of the project.

And, over the course of 31 days and 3,197 miles, he conquered a challenge in which, on any given day, he was completing a feat ‚Äî or, in some cases, feats ‚Äî that many climbers would consider a lifetime achievement in and of itself.

# 16 days¬†|¬†1,207 miles¬†|¬†56 peaks

A couple of days before¬†[Ryan Hall](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/sports/ryan-hall-fastest-us-distance-runner-is-retiring.html), the retired Olympic marathoner, was set to meet Mr. Jornet near Crested Butte, Colo., he checked the forecast. An avid climber, Mr. Hall was alarmed enough to send Mr. Jornet a text message asking if they really wanted to tackle the Elks Traverse in a snowstorm. Mr. Jornet was not concerned.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he replied via text, ‚Äúwe might get a little wet out there.‚Äù

The weather, though, turned out to be pleasant, and Mr. Jornet and Mr. Hall chatted throughout their 12 hours together ‚Äî about their families, about training and nutrition, and even about ‚Äúdifferent levels of consciousness,‚Äù Mr. Hall said. At one point, Mr. Jornet, who is from Spain, described climbing as an out-of-body experience.

Mr. Jornet focuses on each step of the journey along the way, rather than talking about the enormity of the project.

¬†

Nick Danielson

Mr. Hall was surprised to learn that Mr. Jornet did not drink coffee. His explanation? He worries caffeine will make him push too hard and hinder his ability to recover. Mr. Hall said Mr. Jornet made no mention of feeling tired or hungry during their time together.

‚ÄúIt was interesting to see how he managed his body and what he was putting it through,‚Äù Mr. Hall said, ‚Äúand how, mentally, it wasn‚Äôt taking up any space.‚Äù

Mr. Hall also noticed that Mr. Jornet refrained from talking about the project. Instead, he seemed present. The only mountain that mattered was the mountain he was on. Mr. Jornet, Mr. Hall said, was ‚Äúfull of peace‚Äù ‚Äî an impression that was reinforced when they reached Castle Peak, their fifth and final summit together. Not that Mr. Jornet was keeping track.

‚ÄúThe peaks don‚Äôt really mean anything to me,‚Äù he told Mr. Hall. ‚ÄúThe peaks are just an excuse to be out here.‚Äù

The journey included 16 days in Colorado.

¬†

Bjarne SaleÃÅn

Dakota Jones, an elite trail and mountain runner, joined Mr. Jornet for his final two days of climbing in Colorado, which started with an ascent of Mount Sneffels and a 25-mile traverse through the early hours of the night.

When Mr. Jornet awoke the next morning, he rode his bicycle several hours to the next trailhead. Mr. Jones followed Mr. Jornet‚Äôs crew in his Toyota Tacoma and prepared for the day by consuming a burrito, several doughnuts and lots of coffee.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so far beyond what the rest of us can do,‚Äù Mr. Jones said of Mr. Jornet.

At around noon, they embarked on a nearly 14-hour run through the Weminuche Wilderness, a remote area of the San Juan National Forest. By the time they reached their final peak of the day, Mr. Jornet had run out of food.

‚ÄúHe never said a word,‚Äù Mr. Jones said. ‚ÄúHe just kept going. That‚Äôs Kilian.‚Äù

Mr. Jornet spent a total of 16 days in Colorado, where he made 56 summits while covering more than 1,200 miles.

Mr. Jornet‚Äôs climbing partners in Colorado struggled to keep up with him, even though he did not catch rides in his support vehicle, or ingest caffeine.

# Desert Ride

# 5 days¬†|¬†877 miles

Up close, there was nothing inherently sexy about Mr. Jornet‚Äôs quest. Day after day, hour after hour, minute after minute, he was simply putting one foot in front of the other, or pedaling one stroke at a time. Mr. Hall likened him to a ‚Äúmetronome,‚Äù his rhythmic movements never hurried or rushed.

Mr. Jones approached Mr. Jornet as if he were part of an anthropological study: What was he capable of doing next?

‚ÄúHe has both the physiology to be great and the infinite discipline and focus to make the most of what he has,‚Äù Mr. Jones said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs a really rare combination.‚Äù

After completing his climbs in Colorado, Mr. Jornet spent five days biking nearly 900 miles across the Mojave Desert.

¬†

Nick Danielson

Mr. Jornet‚Äôs discipline was clear when, after conquering Colorado, he spent five days biking nearly 900 miles across vast expanses of the Mojave Desert. He averaged about 14 hours a day in the saddle.

He was accompanied for portions of the trip by athletes like Chris Myers, a trail runner, and Gemma Arr√≥ Ribot, a former teammate on the Spanish ski mountaineer team. But Mr. Jornet also spent a great deal of time alone, and he battled boredom, fatigue and the heat by listening to music and audiobooks.

Mostly, though, he biked as a mode of transport, as a means to an end.

# California

# 7 days¬†|¬†593 miles¬†|¬†15 peaks

One of Mr. Jornet‚Äôs early challenges in California was Norman‚Äôs 13, a winding, 100-mile route that links all 13 of the 14,000-foot peaks in the Sierra Nevada. In search of some expertise, Mr. Jornet recruited Olivia Amber, a world-class trail runner who, about two weeks earlier, had done the route on her own.

Some context: Ms. Amber, 30, described Norman‚Äôs 13 as a ‚Äúdream project‚Äù that she had pieced together over several years. For even the most accomplished adventurers, the route is serious business. And when Ms. Amber completed it in 89 hours (which included four hours of sleep), she became the fourth person to ever do so ‚Äî and¬†[the first woman](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/normans-13-ca).

And then there was Mr. Jornet, fresh off hundreds of miles of bicycling through the desert, who intended to move through Norman‚Äôs 13 as just one part of a much larger project. It was difficult for Ms. Amber to comprehend.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs rewriting what‚Äôs possible in the mountains,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúespecially with endurance feats.‚Äù

In California, Mr. Jornet took on Normals 13, a route that covers 13 separate 14,000-foot peaks.

¬†

Andy Cochrane

On Sept. 25, Ms. Amber was set to meet Mr. Jornet at the junction of the Taboose Pass Trail and the John Muir Trail, before their shared trek up Split Mountain. To reach him, she had to jog 12 miles while ascending 6,000 feet ‚Äî and she had to do it in a hurry after receiving word that he was moving quickly.

‚ÄúI honestly thought he was going to beat me there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was crazy.‚Äù

From the start, Ms. Amber could sense Mr. Jornet was egoless. He seemed genuinely grateful for her help. With rough weather approaching, he agreed when she suggested that he take a quick nap before leaving camp.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt totally sure if he was committed to sleeping,‚Äù Ms. Amber recalled.

Each section of Mr. Jornet‚Äôs journey would be considered a major accomplishment for most climbers.¬†

Andy Cochrane

They set out before dusk, and as they began to move through the night, heavy snow blanketed them. It was Ms. Amber‚Äôs sixth time up Split Mountain, and Mr. Jornet‚Äôs first. It hardly mattered.

‚ÄúHe had this feel for where we were and for the terrain even though he had never been there before,‚Äù said Ms. Amber, who accompanied Mr. Jornet for 25 snow-filled miles. ‚ÄúI could just feel that energy from him ‚Äî a confidence that came from a place of deep understanding of how to move in that kind of environment and in those conditions.‚Äù

Of course, Mr. Jornet made it look easy, even when it was not. Later, after biking another 390 miles over two days into the Cascades of Northern California, he reached Mount Shasta ‚Äî the 71st and penultimate peak of his project ‚Äî where he was buffeted by an Arctic wind. He had to crawl the final 1,000 feet to the summit.

‚ÄúYou need to laugh in those situations and find the way to pass through,‚Äù Mr. Jornet said.

Mount Shasta in California was Mr. Jornet‚Äôs 71st peak of the project.¬†

Nick Danielson

# Oregon Ride

# 3 days¬†|¬†489 miles

A few hours after summiting Mount Shasta, Mr. Jornet was on two wheels once again. He was joined by the triathlete Ian Murray for a 60-mile ride on crushed volcanic gravel before they slept just south of the Oregon border.

Mr. Jornet was by himself for the next two days as he rode 430 miles to the foot of Mount Rainier in Washington. The end was near.

When he was planning the project, Mr. Jornet worried about being hit by a car or a truck while biking. ‚ÄúA lot of people were telling me it would be very dangerous,‚Äù he recalled.

Mr. Jornet rode through much of Oregon with the triathlete Ian Murray.

¬†

Nick Danielson

He and his team worked hard to locate the safest roads with the widest shoulders, and he found, to his surprise, that most drivers gave him ample space. He also was grateful for the company of his friends, new and old.

‚ÄúHe clearly could have done every inch of this on his own and he would have been totally fine and totally happy,‚Äù Ms. Amber said. ‚ÄúBut he had this deeper appreciation that people showed up for him and were willing to help him.‚Äù

Mr. Jornet wanted to share the experience with those who joined him for portions of it ‚Äî and with the wider world. Mr. Hall, for example, laughed whenever Mr. Jornet broke out his selfie stick. It was important to Mr. Jornet that he and his team use social media ‚Äî Mr. Jornet has nearly two million followers on Instagram ‚Äî to convey the beauty of the natural world and the importance of protecting it.

During his travels, Mr. Jornet saw moose, coyotes, goats, eagles, snakes and even a couple of bears from a distance. None bothered him, he said.

‚ÄúWe would look at each other,‚Äù Mr. Jornet said, ‚Äúand say: ‚ÄòHey, guys! How are you doing?‚Äô And just continue.‚Äù

# Mount Rainier Finale

Mr. Jornet started up Mount Rainier at dawn on Oct. 3, and it was a final test worthy of the project ‚Äî a 29-mile haul up 14,320 vertical feet before he reached the summit. About 17 hours after he had set out that morning, he returned to the trailhead where his support team was waiting with celebratory slices of pizza and pickle juice shots.

After 31 days and 72 summits, Mr. Jornet‚Äôs objectively absurd project was complete. He covered 629 miles on foot and biked an additional 2,568 miles, which outdistanced this year‚Äôs Tour de France by more than 400 miles. And he did all that while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain.

Mr. Jornet closed out the project with one final test: a 29-mile climb up Mount Rainier that involved 14,320 feet of elevation gain.

¬†

Nick Danielson

Throughout the project, Mr. Jornet wore a smartwatch that tracked his heart rate, his mileage, his sleep totals (he averaged about six hours a night) and even something called his ‚Äúrecovery score,‚Äù which registered zero ‚Äî yes, zero ‚Äî for 17 consecutive days. (At one point, he broke his cellphone, and members of his team questioned whether he had done it on purpose.)

Mr. Jornet estimated that he had burned about 9,000 calories a day, but he managed not to lose any weight. One of his secret weapons: flasks of olive oil that he guzzled raw. By the end of his journey, he was looking forward to homegrown produce from his garden and thick slices of his wife‚Äôs sourdough bread.

The day after summiting Mount Rainier, Mr. Jornet awoke feeling disoriented. His first instinct, he said, was to reach for his bike: Didn‚Äôt he have more miles ahead of him? No, he realized, it was over. He slept more peacefully the next night.

His trek through the Alps last summer, while less physically demanding, had left him mentally drained because so many of the climbs were so challenging. His jaunt through the American West was a comparative breeze.

‚ÄúIt was just fun,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was nice to ride and to run and to see the things and just to enjoy those places. And I could have gone on. I was happy to finish and go home, but physically it felt like my body was ready to continue.‚Äù

For now, Mr. Jornet plans to take a break and spend time with his family.

‚ÄúBut I know myself,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I know in a couple of months that I will start to think of something else.‚Äù",12,1761144540.0,ultrarunning,0,0.84,False

I have two times left coffeeground on the table and my cat goes right into smelling and licking it. We are talking about dry ass unboiled coffeegrounds. He also likes made coffee or leftovers from the cup. If I leave a cup of coffee alone he will try to drink from it. 

Anyone also owns a cat who likes coffee??

I had an offer for cold brew that I wanted to use and they tell me after waiting in line for 20 minutes that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not available?? Ok fine, I get that.

Next, I place an order for a small brown sugar iced latte, this lady charges me $6 for TIMS SMALL COFFEE!?

Initially it didn‚Äôt hit me how much I paid cuz I tapped it using my student card and I couldn‚Äôt see the screen and the charges. She later comes to me and asks what size did you order? I said small‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs like did you order with protein? I‚Äôm like no??? I said small brown sugar iced latte that would come up to $4 MAX.

I then ask her for a receipt. She‚Äôs like here you go and it says it‚Äôs for $6?? I checked my account, saw I paid $6 went crazy with how much I paid. I told her you charged me WITH protein when I never asked for it.

She gives me a bullsit excuse saying, ‚Äúoh when I add small it automatically adds the protein‚Äù

OK AND? what can I do if you added the wrong item? How am I supposed to know what is being added especially if your screens are not working for me to see. I kept arguing with her and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúno no it adds it automatically‚Äù

I‚Äôm so grossed out by this drink and I feel like trashing it, I just feel bad throwing it tho.

Oh and these ladies just gossip in between orders, not even while ordering! They pause, talk and then take the next person.

I‚Äôm never going back to this Tim‚Äôs in my life after the horrible experience.

1oda9ya,https://i.redd.it/km0hvzldeowf1.jpeg,"Week 43: Idioms - ""The Dose Makes the Poison"" - ""Deadly"" Girl Dinner, featuring nuts, onigiri, tuna-poppy salad, cinnamon-nutmeg toast, tomatoes, & choc espresso beans (toxicity info in description)","I'm fascinated by the way everyday foods and ingredients can have such good, healthy properties for us, but simultaneously have properties that can really hurt us. Brazil nuts eapecially wow me, since it takes so little to pose a toxicity problem. The beauty of the dose making the poison, not to even mention all of the foods that are poisonous if not cooked, soaked, harvested properly, etc., is so interesting. Added onto that is how crazy it is that many things we see as harmful are often naturally occurring (like pears having formaldehyde) or have immense medicinal properties (like mold giving us penicillin). As you can see, this was very much of a geek out week. The science of food is it's own world of wonder. 

Brazil Nuts - Just one contains up to 95 mcg of selenium, & the upper safe limit is about 300 mcg per day for adults. Eating too many Brazil nuts can lead to toxic levels of selenium in the body (selenosis) & cause symptoms such as bad breath, diarrhea, nausea, skin rashes/lesions, nerve pain & fatigue. In rare cases, very high levels can cause kidney failure, cardiac arrest & even death.

Almonds - Have amygdalin, a chemical compound that can turn into cyanide. Also, eating too many, too often, can affect the efficiency of the liver and contribute to kidney stones.

Walnuts - Excessive consumption of walnuts may cause diarrhea, bloating, stomach pain or kidney stones. Due to the phytic acid they contain, too many walnuts may also inhibit the absorption of dietary iron, calcium and zinc.

Nutmeg - Even 2 tsp can be toxic from myristicin, an oil that can cause hallucinations, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, & seizures

Cinnamon - Contains high amounts of coumarin, which may be harmful in large doses

Coffee - More than 500‚Äì600 mg per day can overwhelm the nervous system, causing insomnia, nervousness, irritability, stomach cramps, heart palpitations and muscle tremors 

Rice - Contains arsenic, a toxin that can cause bad things like vomiting, abdominal pain, and vertigo when consumed in large quantities. 

Tomatoes - Consuming foods high in acid could lead to reflux and could worsen reflux if you already have it. Over an extended period of time, reflux can cause Barrett's Esophagus, a disorder in which precancerous lesions form on esophageal lining

Tuna - May contain high levels of methylmercury, a neurological toxin

Poppy seeds - during harvesting, the seeds can become contaminated with opiates contained in the milky latex of the seed pod covering them. However, they generally don‚Äôt have nearly enough opiates to intoxicate you.

1oda84d,https://i.redd.it/yx0z8c02eowf1.jpeg,About sa Good Shephered cafe...,"So dumaan ako dito noong soft opening sila dati. Napakaganda ng location and napakaganda yung mga selection nila. Napakasarap din yung mga breads and coffees noong soft opening palang. Sayang naman na wala silang bentang mga ube jam pero hindi sayang yung experience.

Dumaan ako ulit noong grand opening na nila. Nag grand opening sila noong September 1st and andaming naintroduce na products. Yung Shepherd's latte, rice meals, burgers, and halo halo ay naintroduce na din. Andoon pa rin yung first selection like sa breads and coffees sa pwedeng balikan yung mga og. 

Then dumaan ako masrecently this month. Marami din silang bago kagaya sa new coffees, mga bibingka, new teas, napakarami. Pero agad kong nanotice ay same faces ang palagi kong nakikita, hindi naman masama makakita ng familiar face yun nga lang is mukhang di nadagdagan. Compared sa video nila na pliniplay sa loob na napakarami, umunti sila.

Under staffed ata sila. May days na aakyat ako sa 2nd floor nila para kumain and sinerve ako ng staff doon then kinabukasan asa station ng gawaan ng bibingka. May mornings din na iisa lang yung nagseserve ng drinks and babantay ng breads and cucut ng cakes. Grabeng skill yan pero halata pagod na din sina ate at kuya. Masrecently, napansin ko din nawala yung isang staff na babae, di ko sure if tinanggal siya o hindi, isa siya sa nakausap namin na mataas yung boses niya and very welcoming din siya, maslalo sa mga nagIilocano na customer. Masdelikado yung sa 2nd floor. Napapansin ko ay isa lang nagseserve at nagluluto sa early mornings, pano yan if maraming customers? Di ko sure ano yung plano nila pero nahihirapan na din sila, halata sa mukha. Hinahayaan ba silang maiwan na understaffed ng management nila?

Meron din nawitness yung mga kaibigan ko na may nahimatay na 2 employees. Yung isa ay nahimatay pero agad nilang ginising buti nalang wala sa hagdanan, siya ata ay akyat baba ng stairs dahil napansin ng kaibigan ko ay nagwork siya sa 1st floor then umakyat sa 2nd dahil understaffed sila. Yung second employee ay yung masgrabe. Nahimatay siya then di agad gumising. Nakita pa ng owner at nagtawag sila ng guard. Linabas siya agad at pinaupo, buti nalang pinagising siya.

Yung doon naman sa products nila, agad ko napansin ay yung sa may breads nila. Hindi na sila yung parang dati. May ibang breads na flat, paiba iba yung size, may iba na di mukhang toasted, may iba na maliit, tas yung best seller nila na may ube frosting ay paslant yung top or flat na flat naman. Di na sila yung consistent kagaya dati. 

Tinignan ko din yung recent reviews and di na talaga consistent kagaya yung sa ube pandesal nila na may cheese at ube, napapansin ng marami na may iba na punong cheese lang at walang ube then iba na unti ang ube. May isa na sabi parang linagyan ng isang buong cheese nalang asa loob.

Problema din ay mukhang marami na per day yung mga breads nila and nagpapadiscount na din sila ng malaki kapag paclosing. Napapansin ng kaibigan ko na di pa ubos ung stock nila pagdating ng closing and di sure if tinatapon ba nila or for tomorrow. Sayang naman if tinatapon para lang may fresh breads sila for the next day, maslalo sa price nila. Yung hotdog nila na pastry ay 115 pesos na nga, grabe naman para lang sa hotdog na pastry. Yan yung napansin namin na di maubos ubos. Di na consistent yung quality ng ibang breads nila.

Balik doon sa staff pero wala na din ata yung spark nila. May isa na halatang burnt out na ata. Si ate kapag nagregreet ay parang nonchalant na ngay. Titingin sa nails, yung tingin ay sa malayo at hindi sa amin, pero kapag sa ibang employee napakaenergetic na din. Lumilinis din kahit may mga customer, naggregreet then tatalikod or nagwawalis. Minsan nga di na nagregreet. Napansin din na doon lang siya sa tabi at hinahayaan lang yung isa na naiwan sa breads sa mga customers, then kapag aalis yung isa, doon siya babalik sa breads at kapag bumalik, aalis siya ulit. Dati din siyang employee at dati ang laki ng spark niya, ngayon mukhang nawala na yung spark. Then yung isa sa barista, yung matangkad ngay, paexplain ng paexplain doon sa coffee beans nila. Atleast ngayon pwede na natin bilhin yung beans pero dati explain ng explain kahit di tinanong. Gusto lang malaman yung ano best seller na coffees. Tapos maiin your face pa yung narecieved nila na order. Kaysa naman ipakita lang yung order napunta diretso sa mukha yung papel na may order. 

Di ito yung Good Shepherd noong soft opening. Quantity nalang yung focus kaysa quality sa ibang products and mukhang nahahayaan ng management dahil understaffed sila ng grabe. Di ko sure if ito din ay naexperience niyo o hindi, ito lang ay base sa experience ko.",25,1761144252.0,baguio,12,0.96,False

We were together three years. She claims she had BPD although it wasn‚Äôt diagnosed. 

I was so upset and felt so guilty leaving I was put on IV fluids because I couldn‚Äôt stomach water. 

Some background information on how she treated me. These are all incidents some are from high school and some are from university:

-  told me to go to bed and not to stay up with her when she was struggling and INSISTED i go sleep. I woke up to a nasty string of messages the next morning for not being there for her. (HS)

- dumped me because she got bored then admitted it was a test and she likes to push people and said if it happens again fight for her. (HS)

- got jealous i was talking to a friend in the morning instead of her so she walked off and refused to say goodbye. I still had her coffee so i went to her class where she was waiting outside and didn‚Äôt say a word, i just shoved the coffee at her annoyed and left. She then says i was being so mean and maybe we should break up. (HS)

- i went outside with her roommate at a party. We were all getting ready to go outside as a group of ten people and i felt really hot and dizzy and so did she. I told my ex we were stepping out and she didn‚Äôt hear me. When everyone else came outside she pulled me aside and demanded to know why I was out there with her roommate. She then refused to talk to or look at me for the whole night. When i called her on it she half apologized but said i ‚Äúbroke‚Äù a social rule. Im transgender (FTM) and hadnt even fully transitioned yet but even still i dont think me or her did anything inappropriate. (UNI)

- I got depressed and distant over the summer and she wasn‚Äôt very understanding. She started blowing up over everything and refused to talk about the relationship. Her only contributions were ‚Äúits exhausting talking to you‚Äù ‚Äúit only goes in circles with you‚Äù ‚Äúnone of my exes were like this‚Äù (UNI) 

- in the middle of a calm argument (on my end at least) she dumped me. I respected it and said ok. Hours later she comes back and the first thing she says is why didn‚Äôt i stop her or comfort her and I had to point out SHE OWED ME an apology. 


- if i told her I didn‚Äôt see her a negative way I  was ‚Äú invalidating her feelings‚Äù 

- she was ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to speak to me that way because she could ‚Äúhear and feel‚Äù a lack of love and disrespect from me. I asked her where I spoke to her in any way other than patient and understanding and she said it didn‚Äôt matter because she was hearing it. 

- she would say i was villainizing her when id set boundaries even though id actively tell her I loved her and knew it wasn‚Äôt her fault she acted the way she did. She told me being with her entailed accepting a certain role or things other people might not consider fair, but those were her expectations. 

- what scared me was at some point I STARTED acting like her and manipulating her slightly or refusing to be mature or reasonable. She called me out and I did stop after a few weeks. Ive never acted that way before to anyone.

- shed talk down to me during every argument. Shed tells me i wasted years of her life, that I was impossible. I got fed up and said if she wasn‚Äôt going to have a mature conversation I would have to take a break from her. Her response was that I wanted to leave her even though I was actively telling her I didn‚Äôt. She refused to acknowledge that i only wanted to leave if she wasn‚Äôt going to engage with me and then said ‚Äúi hate you‚Äù. 

- I reached my breaking point and said word for word ‚Äúthe way you‚Äôre acting is emotionally abusive‚Äù 

- well she flew off the handle and said i was a joke of a person id hurt her intentionally and it was beyond repair, and she knew from the beginning I was naive based on my friends. Throughout this she was telling her bsf I was being awful and I was a shitty partner and she hadn‚Äôt loved me for a while she just wanted a relationship. This got back to me because her bsf knew me pretty well and wanted proof. Her bsf started dating my bsf and my bsf told her that I wasn‚Äôt a bad person because he couldn‚Äôt stand by and let her convince other people i was awful. Meanwhile I was defending her to all my friends. 

- i was going to leave. But i think her dumping me over and over and devaluing me created a trauma bond. Every time shed take it back she was so loving and affectionate.

- she told me she would give me another chance and i had to decide that night. I said I wanted more time to think but she responded that every second I took with hesitation was a greater insult to her and I should be grateful she was even speaking to me.
I saw her behaviour as justified because I said something that hurt her beyond her worst fears. I took her back.

- after this the relationship did improve surprisingly. And we were together a year after i took her back. At least for a while. When id bring up issues in the relationship shed try to back out of the relationship by saying she cant do this and shes not in a place where she can support me. This happened 4-5 times despite me saying it was a dealbreaker. A week before the breakup she admitted to my bsf she knows her behaviour is toxic. And she admitted to me none of the breakups Were serious despite saying before she felt that they were. 

- now lets get to the final breakup. She asked me again if she really treated me that badly in the past. It reopened a wound and I let it slip that even her ex roommate and friend noticed her mistreatment. (I just found that out the day before from someone who knew us and her) within five seconds she backed out of the relationship again. I was begging her to stay. We agreed id come get my stuff the next day because we were both going to a group hangout that was already planned prior to this. 


Then, ten minutes later, I receive a call from my best friend‚Äôs girlfriend who Im not supposed to be speaking to because she cut off my ex a few months prior for being a bad friend. I stayed neutral to my exes horror throughout that situation. 

- she tells me that she spoke to my exes old roommate/friend. Apparently she was so disturbed by how my ex was treating me she couldn‚Äôt be friends with her, among other reasons. My ex and I thought she was just a bad person who cut her off for no reason although I didn‚Äôt really believe that. She tells me that my ex had everyone convinced i was the toxic one back when I called her abusive, and she felt sick finding out it wasnt true because i was a good person. Apparently my ex put cat litter on her ex friend‚Äôs bed after she set a boundary with her (theres proof she did this). I noticed in the past my ex was a bad/ toxic friend but I brushed it off. Ive since apologized to her ex friend for what happened.

- the next day rolls around and I go over. If it weren‚Äôt for that phone call I would have stayed with her. I now felt guilty for having spoke to her and knew I couldn‚Äôt go back now because id have to tell her. I dont talk much and i pack my stuff while crying. Shes acting completely normal and tries to Address it but i don‚Äôt engage. We go to the hangout snd shes again acting like nothing happened. The next morning I break up with her for good. Shes so understanding and kind and says she completely understands. I dont tell her about the phone call. Im crying and throwing up but I manage to leave. 

- we text a bit after and she says its ok and were both gonna be fine. She says she cant heal and be a better person while in a relationship and I was right that this was the best choice. I was on a fluid drip at work because i felt so guilty and sick. I manage to make it back to my apartment. 

The next day she asks if its really over. I send one long last paragraph saying it is. She tells me I never should have signed up to be with someone that has BPD and all people like me do is villainize people like her. She claims she never meant that it was the best choice.

- she then apologizes and apologizes and begs me to stay and says shes gonna change. I refuse and she turns to threatening to burn my things. When i beg her not to do that she says she cant believe id think of her that poorly and I must not have ever known or loved her. I pointed out i was directly responding to what she said but according to her I should have known she didn‚Äôt mean it. I was kind, firm, and patient but she continued to talk down to me and say i used her and all sorts of terrible things.

I tell her this proved my point and she hasn‚Äôt changed. She claims she didn‚Äôt know that her impulse breakups were making me suicidal and she thought they only made me anxious and sick. I told her in no way would I be with someone that thinks her doing that to me at all was okay and the fact she caused me any harm should be enough to make her stop. 

Over the next few days she proceeds to beg and try to manipulate me again. I went no contact. She called me a week later saying the least i can do after everything is respond. I did. I had nightmares where shed call and talk down to me. My best friend said this is unacceptable and I have to block her. Shes now blocked on everything. 


It‚Äôs now been a month. Im doing so much better. The hardest part is unpacking how I allowed what I did, and that If it weren‚Äôt for that phone call I would have stayed. That says a lot about how I value myself. I still have nightmares. Apparently Ive been screaming for help in my sleep. 

It‚Äôs so so hard now that I‚Äôve realized the good and bad side of her was all just her. And that just because it felt like a majority was happy and stable doesn‚Äôt mean the minority wasnt abuse. The abuse was maybe 30% of a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù ‚Äúloving‚Äù relationship. Now I know that doesn‚Äôt matter. I kick myself for not standing up and leaving sooner. I kick myself for the person i was and how I thought about the people who cut her off for good reason. 

Im not bitter. I just moved into an apartment (right before we broke up) with my amazing best friend. I have great friends pretty good family, and a great degree im working towards.

I hindered my growth so much and I spent three years with a shot nervous system and all sorts of mental and physical symptoms because of the stress. 

Its a very uncomfortable reality that you accepted less. I wish id come to the conclusion that I deserved better on my own. It took so many people for me to see that and honestly I only did a few weeks after I got out. 

Is there any advice for moving on? Sometimes it‚Äôs still hard to see her as an abuser.

Capt'n and I have been married 14 years last week. I struggle with codependency and people pleasing.. which means I usually will do for others so much that I burn myself out. I also suffer from migraines.

Yesterday, he and I woke up sick (thanks kids) but for some reason it was worse for me. It was triggering a migraine and while I needed to go lay down and nap I couldn't. Kids need to be homeschooled, I pick up food for some neighbours in the morning, I had an online meeting around lunch I couldn't miss.. and then I had a very important meeting last night I was leading! I managed to get a short nap in the afternoon but it wasn't enough. I told him I was going to rally and try to make the meeting last night so he could drop me off on his way to take the kids to their club. 

Guys.. this guy.. after making coffee and dinner he looks at me and decided he just wasn't going to take me. He grabbed the kids and left! He made me stay home! I had a quiet evening alone at home with almost no lights on to drink my coffee and tea in peace! The nerve! 

And if that wasn't enough, he comes home with surprise orange juice and meds! I mean really!

1od9xbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1od9xbv/my_trip_to_china_18_days/,My Trip to China - 18 days,"I recently went on a trip to China with my wife, who is a self described ""mainlander"" from Sichuan. She planned the whole thing and even managed to snag us business class tickets at a massive discount from Boston to Shanghai. We've been married for 5 years and this is my first time to China. I ended up getting the 10 year visa through NYC - as it was before China opened up their tourist visas.  

We visited 3 cities and one smaller city and a few villages. Our first stop was Shanghai and it was pretty impressive. The downtown area is huge, and really has no comparison, even with places like NYC. All the buildings light up at night and it's quite a show. We were traveling during the early October celebration. We stayed in The Bund within walking distance of Yu Garden, which is a cool tourist area. My favorite part of the city was Nanchang Road, which is very much like Boston's Back Bay - all these small boutique shops with some great coffee places like Metal Hands.  

Our second city was Chengdu. Also a very impressive city and the food is amazing, if you like Mala style. It's considered an upper tier food destination now. People Park was fun and it was cool to see the match making section where young adults put up their ""Resumes"" trying to find a match. There were 4 times as many pink as blue (guys take note). Just outside the city is another smaller city called Dujiangyan which is home to the irrigation system, panda reserve and Qingcheng Shan. All high recommended.  

While in Chengdu, my wife's family threw us a wedding ceremony. It was a great experience. I even wore a traditional Chinese gown during the greeting phase. I wasn't forced to ""buy"" my wife away from her bridesmaids with red envelopes.  

We finished our trip in Beijing. There we saw all the sites like Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, The Summer Palace and the Great Wall. As far as cities go, I think it was the least impressive of the three but it had more tourist areas to check out. Our last night we ate at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant called XinRongJi - highly recommended. We stayed right off of Qianmen Street, which allowed us quick access to everything.  

The Good:  

1. Everything is cheap - underground tickets are 50 cents USD, Didi $5, a good meal for 2 people with drinks $20. 90 minutes massages $15. Groceries dirt cheap. The only things expensive were foreign brands. The US dollar goes far at a 1-7 RMB exchange rate.  
2. Transportation is spectacular - subway is top notch, high speed rail is awesome, and DiDi is better than Uber/Lyft.  
3. WeChat/AliPay - it takes getting used to but kinda love these all in one apps. Once I got the hang of it, I used AliPay for everything. It works on my Android on T-Mobile too. The wife ended up getting a Chinese brand phone and number - which apparently is needed to get the full functionality of WeChat. I attempted to use WeChat for some things but it didn't like my Western phone number.  
4. Infrastructure - In general, I think the US is in big trouble. China is becoming highly advanced very quickly and the US is being left behind. Example being the fast electrification of China. Most if not all new cars are EVs, and in most urban areas it seems like 80% of the passengers cars on the road already are. The power grid and renewable power generation has easily already outclassed the US. This has helped move China off of coal, and the urban area air quality as improved dramatically, my wife claims.  

The Bad:  

1. Smoking - it's still a huge problem there. Even in high end hotels where they prohibit smoking you can tell people attempt to subvert the rules and smoke in the fire wells or in the bathrooms with the fans on. Most restaurants still allow smoking, even in urban areas, with the notable exception of ultra high end places. We ate at a Michelin restaurant in Beijing and we still smelled it when apparently one of the line cooks went out and must have left the door open.  
2. Spitting/hygiene - this is related to smoking as it seems like its exclusively older men, who ""hawk up a loogy"" everywhere we go. It's pretty nasty. I always saw mothers letting their kids pee in a bush or behind a building. Come on people, there are free public bathrooms everywhere.  
3. Personal Space/Pedestrian issues - there is no such thing. People stand shoulder to shoulder, right up against you on the subway. When you are walking down to street expect to get run into several times an hour. It got to the point where my wife was tired of me complaining and just told me to hard shoulder them back and refuse to move. This actually worked. It seems like no one else cares if they are run into. Also get the scooters OFF the sidewalks.  
4. Squat toilets - I'm a 50 year old dude with two bad knees from years of running marathons. Fuck these things.  
5. The Great Firewall - nuff' said.   

Overall, a great country and I will be back. Since I am married to a girl who still has her Chinese citizenship, I am considering getting a Q1 visa and perhaps buying a second home in Chengdu.

Ya‚Äôll üòÆ‚Äçüí® I could really use some support, inspiration, hope, feedback, anything you‚Äôve got. I‚Äôm so tired and the anxiety has been leading to depression and fear and I just need to know there‚Äôs a way through this. 

SIBO symptoms (constipation, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, sensitive to FODMAPs, constant bloating, gas, weight loss etc) began after a short round of antibiotics almost 6 months ago. I‚Äôve always had HORRIBLE gastro reactions to antibiotics. Also, I‚Äôve not had a breath test done. But I had blood work done and everything came back normal and perfect. Endoscopy/Colonoscopy, basic stool tests, and biopsies all perfect. My hospital didn‚Äôt have access to the aspirate test to test for SIFO/SIBO. 

The weight loss has been the most worrisome. I was already small with Hashimoto‚Äôs (about 128 lbs at 5‚Äô6‚Äù) but now my weight fluctuates from 105-110 throughout the day. I have a BMI of 17. Any parts of my body that had fat are entirely depleted now.

All I could eat without symptoms was meat and leafy greens. I cycled through several weeks of antimicrobials (Berberine, oregano oil, Neem) and then did 5-8 drops 2x a day of Biocidin Botanicals for another 5-6 weeks. Towards the end of that treatment, my food tolerance did a 180 and I suddenly couldn‚Äôt tolerate honey, coffee, tea, carbs, bread, starches, histamine foods, rice, sugar, & had body itchiness (groin, scalp, armpits) and had awful sugar cravings. I also noticed heart palpitations and anxiety when I had those foods. That‚Äôs when I believed I had SIFO. Though there was still weight loss and feeling weak, I felt better and my stool was a lot better off of Biocidin.

But due to the weight loss, I knew there was still something going on and stealing my nutrients. So my gastro gave me Xifaxan 550 mg which I‚Äôve been on for 10 days. There really aren‚Äôt any negative side effects or die off I noticed with it. But then my PCP gave me Fluconazole 200mg üòµ‚Äçüí´ this is day 5 for me. And wow, I feel twice as bad as I did on Biocidin. I‚Äôm nauseous, bloated, crampy, ‚Äúwired and tired,‚Äù anxious, shaky, diarrhea again, and heart palpitations (which I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs HI or not). I feel like I‚Äôm dying. And I‚Äôll get in my head about it, wondering if I‚Äôm slowly wasting away or if this is the medication working and just Herx/die-off. The timing of it would certainly allude to that. I‚Äôm just so anxious and dysregulated. I do try to manage stress and regulate, but gosh it‚Äôs hard.

So. Any success stories, thoughts, wisdom, encouragement, all of it is so appreciated. Thank you all so much in advanced. ü§ç please be kind, I‚Äôm pretty overwhelmed right now.",1,1761143129.0,SIBO,2,0.67,False

# ‚öìÔ∏è My Picks:

‚Ä¢	**Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church** \- The so-called ‚ÄúWorking Class Cathedral,‚Äù built not by tycoons but by dockworkers and seamstresses pooling their pay week after week.

‚Ä¢	**Parren Mitchell House** \- Once home to Parren J. Mitchell, Maryland‚Äôs first Black congressman and a civil-rights trailblazer who fought for minority business rights nationwide. Today it stands as a reminder that Baltimore‚Äôs fight for equality didn‚Äôt just happen in the streets -  it happened right here in its rowhouses.

‚Ä¢	**Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum** \- Once the beating heart of America‚Äôs rail network, where local machinists, porters, and engineers helped drive the industrial revolution.

‚Ä¢	**Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church** \- Founded in 1787, it‚Äôs Baltimore‚Äôs oldest Black Methodist congregation and one of the first in the nation. A cornerstone of faith and freedom, it played a key role in education and civil rights organizing throughout the city‚Äôs history.

‚Ä¢	**Winans Chapel and Baltimore City Fire Museum** \- Step into the same firehouses where generations of firefighters lived, cooked, and worked around the clock to keep the city safe.

‚Ä¢	**Union Collective** \- A modern rebirth of an old factory where breweries, coffee roasters, and small-batch makers carry on the city‚Äôs hands-on, hard-work legacy.

‚Ä¢	**American Brewing Building (Hendler Creamery)** \- A monument to two Baltimore staples: beer and ice cream. Built by immigrant laborers and revived by modern creators.

‚Ä¢	**Holland Tack Factory** \- Once home to thousands of workers producing billions of sewing pins and tacks that literally held America together.

‚Ä¢	**Peabody Library** \- Funded by a merchant who believed education should be free to all, its ironwork and marble galleries were crafted by the city‚Äôs artisans - not imported luxury.",97,1761143099.0,baltimore,19,0.97,False

1od9p34,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSbookclub/comments/1od9p34/quote_from_the_magic_mountain_thomas_mann/,Quote from The Magic Mountain - Thomas Mann,"Still, as we said, Hans Castorp‚Äôs diminished friends and teachers were always well served when they could wrangle. They were in their element, whereas the personality was not. Though one might have two views of the r√¥le he played when wrangling was the order of the day. But on the other hand, when the scene changed from the sphere of the intellectual to the strictly earthly and practical, and dealt with questions, and in fields, where commanding natures prove their worth‚Äîthen there were no two views possible. For then the others were undone, then they were cast in the shade, then they drew in their horns, and Peeperkorn came out, grasped the sceptre, arranged, decided, ""settled."" Was there any wonder, then, that he behaved so as to bring that state of things about, that he sought to override logomachy? He suffered, while it held sway, or if it held sway for long. But not in his vanity. Of that Hans Castorp felt assured. For vanity is not on the grand scale, nor is greatness vain. No, Peeperkorn‚Äôs need of reality had other grounds. It sprang, to put it baldly, from fear: from a characteristic infirmity of minds on the grand scale, from the sensitively and passionately cherished point d‚Äôhonneur which Hans Castorp had struggled to explain to Herr Settembrini, describing it as in a sense a military trait.  
  
""Ladies and gentlemen,"" the Dutchman said, and lifted his sea-captain‚Äôs hand, with its nails like lance-heads, in entreaty and monition. ""Ladies and gentlemen. Very good. Very. Asceticism. Indulgences. Lust of the flesh. By all means. Most important. Most debatable. But may I‚ÄîI should like to‚ÄîI fear we may commit a serious error. Are we not irresponsibly neglecting‚Äîone of our highest‚Äî"" He drew in a deep breath. ""Ladies and gentlemen. This air‚Äîthis characteristic thawing air, with its somewhat enervating breath, full of memories and promises of spring‚Äîwe should not breathe it in to breathe it out in‚ÄîReally.‚ÄîI must implore you. We must not. It is an insult. We should give it out only in the form of praise‚Äîof complete and utter‚Äîenough, ladies and gentlemen. I interrupt myself‚Äîin honour of‚Äî"" He did, indeed, stand still, bent backward, shading his brows with his hat. They followed his gaze. ""May I,"" said he, ""may I draw your attention upwards‚Äîhigh in the sky, to that black, circling point against the blue, intensely blue, shading into black‚Äîthat is a bird of prey. It is, if I am not mistaken‚Äîlook, ladies and gentlemen, look, my child. It is an eagle. Most emphatically I call your attention‚Äîlook, it is no buzzard, no vulture, it is an eagle. If you were as far-sighted as my advancing age‚Äîyes, my child, advancing‚Äîmy hair is white. You would see, as plainly as I do, the blunt pinions‚Äîit is a golden eagle. He circles directly overhead, he hovers, not a single beat of his wing‚Äîat a tremendous height in the blue, and with his keen, far-sighted eyes under the prominent bony structure of his brows he is peering earthwards. The eagle, ladies and gentlemen, the bird of Jove, king of his kind, the lion of the upper air. He has feathered gaiters, and a beak of iron, with a sudden hook at the end; claws of enormous strength, their talons curving inwards, the front ones overlapped by the long hinder one in an iron clutch. Look!"" And he tried to put his long fingers in the posture of an eagle‚Äôs claw. ""Gaffer, why are you circling and spying up there?"" He turned his head upwards again. ""Strike! Strike downward, with your iron beak into head and eyes, tear out the belly of the creature God gives you‚Äîsplendid! Splendid! Absolutely! Bury your talons in its entrails, make your beak drip with its blood‚Äî""  
  
He had wrought himself to a pitch. All interest in Settembrini‚Äôs and Naphta‚Äôs antinomies was fled away. But the vision of the eagle remained‚Äîeven though they ceased talking about it, and devoted themselves to the programme they were carrying out under Mynheer‚Äôs lead. They stopped at an inn to eat and drink‚Äîquite out of hours, but with an appetite whetted by silent memories of the eagle. There was a feasting and a tippling, such as always went on where Mynheer was, in Dorf or Platz, or the inns at Claris and Klosters, whither they had gone in the little train. Under his tutelage, they tasted the ""classic"" gifts of life: coffee and cream with fresh bread, moist cheese and fragrant Alpine butter, heavenly-tasting with hot roasted chestnuts. They drank red Veltliner, to their hearts‚Äô content. Peeperkorn accompanied the impromptu meal with a fire of ejaculations; or incited Anton Karlowitsch Ferge to talk, that good-natured sufferer, who abhorred all high thoughts, but could hold forth so acceptably on the subject of the manufacture of rubber shoes in Russia. He described how the rubber mass was treated with sulphur and other substances, and the finished, glossy product subjected to a heat of over two hundred degrees to ""vulcanize"" it. He talked about the polar circle, for his business trips had more than once taken him thither; about the midnight sun, and eternal winter at the North Cape‚Äîall this out of his scraggy throat, from beneath his bushy moustaches. Up there, he said, the steamers looked tiny, next the gigantic cliffs, on the steel-grey surface of the sea. And a yellow radiation was diffused over great tracts of the heavens‚Äîthe northern lights. The whole thing had seemed spooky to him, Anton Karlowitsch: the scene and himself to boot.",6,1761143056.0,RSbookclub,2,1.0,False

He was cool with this, so we arranged a time / place. I get to the agreed place, and with a few minutes to go I see he's online, still a few miles away. Kind of weird. Then, instead of turning up as agreed, he blocks me.

1od9o2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1od9o2x/what_types_of_wireless_mouse_are_available/,What types of wireless mouse are available?,"Hey everyone! I've been using computers for over 15 years now, and I've gone through countless wireless mice during that time. I thought I'd share my experience and knowledge about the different types available in the market today.

First off, let's talk about optical wireless mice. These are probably the most common ones you'll find. They use LED technology to track movement and work great on most surfaces. I've been using one for my daily work, and it's super reliable. The battery life is decent too - I usually get about 6 months before needing to change batteries.

Then there are laser wireless mice, which are like optical mice's more sophisticated cousins. They're more precise and can work on virtually any surface, even glass! I used one for gaming, and the accuracy was mind-blowing. You can find some great options here: https://athometouch.com/wireless-mouse

Gaming wireless mice deserve their own category. These bad boys come with extra buttons, adjustable DPI settings, and ultra-low latency. Some even have RGB lighting (yeah, I'm a sucker for those pretty colors too!). They're usually rechargeable and can last anywhere from 20-70 hours on a single charge.

Ergonomic wireless mice are another interesting type. They're designed to reduce wrist strain and prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. I switched to one when I started getting wrist pain, and it made a huge difference. Some look weird at first - like vertical mice - but trust me, your wrist will thank you.

Travel wireless mice are super compact and portable. They're perfect if you work on the go. I keep one in my laptop bag, and it's been a lifesaver during coffee shop work sessions.

If you're looking for a good wireless mouse for yourself, I'd recommend checking out this collection: https://athometouch.com/wireless-mouse. They have options for every need and budget.

One thing I've learned is that the type of wireless mouse you need really depends on your use case. A basic optical mouse is fine for everyday tasks, but gamers might want something more sophisticated. Similarly, if you work long hours, an ergonomic option might be worth considering.

Battery life is another factor to consider. Some use regular AA batteries, while others are rechargeable via USB. The rechargeable ones are more convenient but might need charging more frequently.

Hope this helps you understand the different types available! Let me know if you have any questions - I'd be happy to share more specific recommendations based on your needs.",1,1761142988.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

1od9mow,https://i.redd.it/gp657p21aowf1.jpeg,I am from the State that had been called Bosnia. Has anyone seen the family of a Mother and two Daughters that lived in this street?,"
  (Post one here) Prva objava je ovdje: https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ocb1c7/i_am_from_the_country_that_used_to_be_called/

  Again, I don‚Äôt want to understate the true purpose of my posts here. In the attached photo is a picture of the street my wife, Donya Zlata, used to live in the 90s before everything happened. In the first post, there is an attatched photo of her. She‚Äôs in her 30s in this photo, 60 now. If you have any information on her, please send me a private message on her whereabouts. My name is Emir Zlata, I still remember it today. Tell her I‚Äôve been doing everything I could to come back home for the last three decades. Tell her she‚Äôs endured greater than anything else as the woman of my dreams holed up in the shithole in Omsk.

  There‚Äôs a reason they only show you top-down or eye level imagery of the Omsk Governor-General Palace and the nice top-crust neighbourhood around it in that city. It‚Äôs gotten better in more recent years but it still smells like smog ‚Äì mechanical and heavy. The smell in Omsk was a constant reminder. But it all started with a different smell, thirty-three years ago, in an airport in Almaty.

  A concoction of salt-slicken sweat and the smell of cheap menthol cigarettes on dirtied garments of the average passenger in ALA in the 90s. The toilets, I remember, were particularly rich with that smell. This smell I remember like an imported bouquet in Omsk. It‚Äôs human ‚Äì organic. 

  The smell was the first thing I noticed upon exiting from my aircraft alongside an absence of temperature.

  I was returning back alone then, one of the first amongst my colleagues in Energoinvest. Like strained and clogged piping, air is passed through the countless coughing businessmen there that time of night much in the same way as the air-conditioning. It was pleasantly cool, seamless with the dry airs outside the building. If you tried, the air hid end notes of machine oil and cheap chemical cleaner. 

  The lights were the next thing. Kazakh Cyrillic was hard to parse but the Russian was something I could interpret with apt competency. They were printed on paper kept in one of those single-stand metal signs by the gate, all arrows pointing towards ‚Äúcarina‚Äù. Lit white - they seemed so sterile compared to what I was used to with the yellowed lighting in Noi Bai International and even in Sarajevo. Cylindrical ceiling lights hummed a steady foil to the fans that did little more than blow air faster indoors. 

  I did the autopilot-actions, checking to make sure my bag was still closed and checked to see if my documents including the worn pored ridge of my passport were still there in the same inner compartment.

  Twenty five counters in customs ‚Äì five open to citizens of the Union and two to us travellers. The rest were closed. Really, the signs were useless to us at this hour. The line I was supposed to queue in stretched up the stairs that led down to the counters and was visible from the gates. Check my watch, ‚Äò3:13 a.m. , still nearly four more hours till I have to make it to my next flight.‚Äô  

  Four o‚Äô four. There was a man in front of me in line who smelt heavily of booze arguing with the customs officer over his mismatching thumbprints.

  ‚ÄúThe fuck you mean I need to go to the office to present further documentation? I just come back from family visit, what is there to declare or put as reason of visit?‚Äù His accent was difficult, comprehension pushed through by incessant insistence and volume. He was smacking his photo in a small red passport on the granite table at this point, ‚ÄúL-Look look. Look here. HERE. I have the same face, yes? This is me is it not?‚Äù

  I eyed the other line. It was certainly a lot shorter then than it had been before, I just prayed that the man would just get over his hissy fit. I prayed that the customs officer ‚Äì visibly tense but ever straight-faced ‚Äì would try something else already. 

 But he just wouldn‚Äôt shut up, ‚ÄúHey. Hey. Look.‚Äù He looks around. There were security elements present in the hall, surprisingly many, all holding big guns no civilian officer should have, but they‚Äôd turned a blind eye to his prolonged protest for a good while then. I couldn‚Äôt discern anymore what he was saying. All I saw was him trying to slip something to the lady behind the glass panes that separated them ‚Äì again, no reaction to be found. It was only when his fingers had passed into the gap between the counter and glass shield that the level clerk stood up at once, the words strung from the sentence before leading into shouts in a bewildering escalation.

  She was a tall lady, curled brown hair and rather fat ‚Äì reminiscent of the tired waitresses I‚Äôd see being played in old American films in diners. I could‚Äôve never expected such an anger to bloom from her that quickly as she shouted, words grating against the man‚Äôs own, ‚ÄúDO NOT MOVE YOUR HAND BEHIND THE COUNTER MISTER. I WILL-‚Äù The man swatted her hand away in alarm. I couldn‚Äôt blame him. She had grabbed it immediately following her outburst with both hands pulling it back into the counter so fiercely. She didn‚Äôt like that, ‚ÄúHEY! DO NOT TOUCH THE AIRPORT STAFF!! SECURITY!! SECURITY!!‚Äù

  Her last words were shrill ‚Äì hard to listen to, her last words said in Kazakh. I thought then that she must have been mad, one of those mentally-affected individuals or something. The men standing idly at the edges of the room clearly thought otherwise. Already, and seemingly before she had even called for them, they had broken into a full-out sprint, headed directly for the man who was now stammering near-incoherently. 

  ‚ÄúC-come on miss. Okay. I will go. I will go with your men over there just- GOD-‚Äù

  I could clearly see now the uniforms the guards in the hall wore. They were military, and strangely out-of-place in the airport. I knew things had changed during Ligachev‚Äôs premiership but even just weeks before, I'd never gotten to see members of the border troops patrol a civilian airport there.

  The younger one of the guards had pinned the man that stood before me to the ground, cheeks pressed flatly against the floor tiles. The guard was untucking the man‚Äôs shirt and aggressively filing through his wares and belongings, throwing out his personal stuffs onto the floor. Keys, wallet, candy wrappers, everything he had really. By the time the other two guards further out in the hall had made it to the scene, the poor man on the floor was gasping in a kind of panic as he tried in vain to tilt his head to address the flat-faced blonde who was pressing an elbow into his back, ‚ÄúA-are YOU CRAZY?! LET ME GO! SHIT.‚Äù He switched to his native tongue ‚Äì definitely Serbian ‚Äì while he laid squirming on the floor. 

  My heart was thumping out of my chest. I didn't smoke much then but my heart hurt like it was overworked from a long run. It raced and raced, ‚ÄòHoly shit. Shit. Where are my documents? Where the fuck are they?‚Äô

  The other two KGB Border guys there had finished their jog there, one scanning the area whilst radioing in someone else about the situation. You can believe me when I say I looked as downwards as I could trying to avoid their gaze as best I could.

  ‚ÄúHey! Sir! You're next.‚Äù

  I looked up stupidly in horror as I saw the counter lady half standing gesturing to me to get to the counter. I think I would have shit myself then if I hadn't noticed she looked stable again. I took a wide step over the legs of the man on the floor as I tried to smile and present my documents. I only saw then that the man behind me had been trying to slip the lady a small stack of Ruble to the customs officer.

  Horrible time that day for a Bosniak that speaks in rough and difficult Russian to be looking nervous. You must understand that there was a war going on near Russian borders there. Everyone there was on high alert for Serbian Confederates and quite apparently so then and there. I doubt they'd be able to differentiate my accent from the Serb‚Äôs.

  ‚ÄúPassport and documents please.‚Äù

  I handed them stacked together to the lady. She'd taken them and passed them through a system machine that read passports. It'd made the sound I'd expected of a successful read and so I'd begin opening my bag to place back my papers. Only she followed up by saying, ‚ÄúWait. Sir, we don't have any match to your passport or name in our system.‚Äù

  I froze there for a second but no longer. 'A mistake,'  I thought, 'It must be a mistake with their new machines. The Bosnian passport is new.'  Maybe somehow some kind of problem would come so I brought papers as well verifying my identity and purpose of my trip to Vietnam, ‚ÄúPlease. My fault, I think there's some other papers in the middle of the stack there I put that you can u- yes that one there.‚Äù I was trying to point to the ones held together with a paper clip, hands awkwardly avoiding the glass pane like the plague, my own voice tighter than I‚Äôd anticipated.

  She had on her desk a plastic box computer which she tapped something into. It would take some time before she would be able to verify my case there I surmised.

  ‚ÄúPlease, ser. Help me, please,‚Äù it came from the older man behind me, the one on the floor. But none of the other passengers wanted anything to do with the man. It was only his whispering that broke the mosquito-pitch humming of the white lights above ‚Äì overturned and staining the room with a pristine quality that was almost blue, heavier than white.

  I felt a tug on the fabric of my pant sleeve. ‚ÄòOh no,‚Äô I thought, ‚ÄòWas the guy talking to me?‚Äô

  ‚ÄúSer please. Tell‚Ä¶ Friend, please tell these officers that I wasn't doing anything to that lady there, yes?‚Äù

  Switched up. He was talking to me in Serbian then. I looked down at him. I saw him properly for the first time. He had a fair bit of pudge on him. Yes, he was definitely older than me, sporting greyed balding hair in a respectable coat and collared shirt ‚Äì formal and plain. He wasn't visiting family.

  The flat-faced officer look up at me as the guy said those words.

  In every possible hurry to respond, ‚ÄúI really don't know this man. We just met. We have actually never met before, I don‚Äôt know him.‚Äù

  I‚Äôd never lived in the USSR before but I have family that worked or lived there before shortly. So it usually came from them hearing from friends of friends in Moscow or the other big cities in the union the warning not to talk too loosely even in your own hotel or dorm rooms. It‚Äôs why a grown man like myself nearly pissed myself as I tried and failed to act as normally as possible to the man in green military garb in front of me.

  The older businessman on the floor tugged at my pants, practically begging me to help him, ‚ÄúYou! You understand! Tell them! For God's sake, I can hear it in your Russian, we're the same! Help me!‚Äù 

  I was dumbfounded, ‚ÄòWhat does this man possibly think I could do then? Oh- Oh no‚Ä¶‚Äô

  The flat-faced blonde had stood up and, still meeting my gaze, walked up to me, reaching his arm forwards. My clasped hands raised to my chest.

  He just gestured to the lady at the counter behind me. And indeed, she‚Äôd been calling for me for some time now ‚Äì no match still. It wasn‚Äôt all bad though. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get to the departure hall but she had told me I‚Äôd be allowed into the terminal to collect my baggage and wait for my information to be processed. I was sent on my way.

  Passing through the gates, I saw the businessman being taken away by the three officers through some door at the back of the customs hall. I might have pitied him if he hadn‚Äôt nearly gotten me into trouble with Soviet border security.

 The terminal was nice ‚Äì quaint really. It might have been the smell of cologne or coffee from stores in the place that dulled the place‚Äôs natural smell. In particular, that coffee aroma had caught my attention. It smelt fresh and like the arabica my wife used to buy for me before the war, and perhaps around half to five in the morning their stalls were starting to prepare for breakfast already. 

  I checked the time. More than enough to grab breakfast with the too-bright yellow signage that lined the sides of the walls pointing to gates 11-20 down the hall telling me much the same thing. 

  The cafe had a television screen playing some sports game the two other men seated in the place were watching. I wasn‚Äôt all too interested. They left and one of the baristas changed the channel to the local news broadcast, ‚ÄúQazaqstan TV‚Äù bolded in a white strip over the red lined headlines that read ‚Äì ‚Äú–¢–Ü–ö–µ–ª–µ–π —ç—Ñ–∏—Ä: –ë–∞–ª“õ–∞–Ω —Ç“Ø–±–µ–≥—ñ–Ω–¥–µ –±–µ–π–±—ñ—Ç—à—ñ–ª—ñ–∫. –°–∞—Ä–∞–µ–≤–æ “õ–æ—Å –Æ–≥–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏—è–ª—ã“õ –∫“Ø—à—Ç–µ—Ä–≥–µ –±–µ—Ä—ñ–ª–¥—ñ. –ñ–∞“£–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –¥“Ø–Ω–∏–µ–≥–µ –∫–µ–ª–¥—ñ‚Äù or ‚ÄúLIVE: Peace in the Balkans. Sarajevo capitulates to the joint Yugoslavian forces. A new confederation is born‚Äù 

  I dropped my half-eaten sandwich. I must have decided that had been an underreaction to the situation and so my other hand found itself dropping my coffee as well, scalding myself and browning my pants. I yelled profanities as I jumped to my feet, flicking off the hot liquid off my hands. They trembled, reaching for the napkin on the table. 


  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry sir! I‚Äôll help you clean up.‚Äù

  I saw one of the waitresses come to help me clean up the mess I‚Äôd made looking as if she had something else she wanted to say. She pauses, then says, ‚ÄúAre you by any chance from there? The region.‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúY-yes. Bosnian,‚Äù came the reply. I remember feeling then like I had a jackhammer hammer the sheer absurdity of what I was seeing there on the television. If I hadn‚Äôt spilled the coffee on myself, I might have thought I was having a terrible terrible nightmare.

  My thoughts ran ‚Äì they ran hundreds of miles till they reached a small estate in town within Sarajevo. For on the television screen, real-time news footage was being streamed of tanks and soldiers rolling into a familiar town square. I saw my frightened daughters, Adla and Sadeta. And I saw my wife who would be out in the market around this time there. I felt sick.

  I excused myself and apologised listlessly to the waitress before heading to the washroom. 

  I don‚Äôt know if I misremember things about that moment then or if my eyes had been playing a cruel trick on me then but as I hurried to the washroom, the mirror saw one of them behind me ‚Äî standing perfectly still, reflected, though the hallway had just been empty.
