1n2pu8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n2pu8i/does_the_frigidaire_ultrawf_water_filter_deliver/,Does the Frigidaire ULTRAWF Water Filter Deliver Cleaner Taste? Honest Review,"**Daily Convenience for Clean Water**  
Testing the Frigidaire ULTRAWF Pure Source Ultra Water Filter has been part of my daily habit. This white, compact tool fits snugly into my fridge and does its job without being obtrusive. Coming in at 11""D x 2.25""W x 3""H, I didn’t struggle with space, and its lightweight design—just 0.63 pounds—made handling a breeze. It has an understated aesthetic which doesn’t scream for attention but adds a subtle cleanliness to its functionality. It reminded me of an unsung hero, working tirelessly behind the scenes.

**Ease of Installation and Setup**  
The installation process was surprisingly easy. With its push-to-release mechanism, swapping the old one for the new filter felt satisfying, akin to pressing the right vending machine button as a kid. After installation, priming was equally straightforward—run the water for three minutes, discard it, and you’re set. While performing the reset of the reminder light, I held the Water Filter button for about three seconds, and just like that, red turned to green on my refrigerator display. The moment was like a tiny victory, and it left me feeling quite the handyman.

**Advantages**  
- Certified to NSF/ANSI Standards 42, 53, and 401, ensuring water safety.  
- Removes contaminants like lead, mercury, and pesticides effectively.  
- Filters both taste and odor, leaving me with refreshingly crisp water.

**Performance That’s Worth Discussing**  
What I found impressive is its ability to not only remove harmful contaminants but also improve the taste drastically. I’m one of those coffee enthusiasts who believe water quality impacts flavor, and my morning brew tastes better since switching to this filter. Even my son, who used to resist drinking water, now drinks more without any prompting—possibly because it no longer carries the faint taste of chlorine.

However, one thing to note is that the flow rate is slightly reduced after installation. It's not annoyingly slow, but you’ll notice the difference when filling containers.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Family hydration has become easier and enjoyable.  
- Easy installation process, even for those less DIY-inclined.  
- Certified by Water Quality Association for sustainability.  
- Fits securely into the PureSource Ultra filter system without complications.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Flow rate may feel slower compared to standard filters.  
- Reminder light doesn’t automatically reset.  
- Filter lifespan varies depending on usage intensity.  

**Competing Products**  
During my water-filter research frenzy, I came across alternatives like Brita Longlast and GE RPWFE filters. Brita Longlast offers excellent durability (lasting up to six months) but doesn’t match the impressive chlorine and odor removal of the Frigidaire filter. On the other hand, the GE RPWFE shares similar installation ease but leans toward the pricier end without delivering better performance. Frigidaire ULTRAWF strikes a balance of efficiency, safety certifications, and user-friendliness that its competitors lack.

**Smart Spending**  
Investing in this filter might appear steep for what looks like an unassuming refrigerator part, but the results speak for themselves. The assurance of clean, worry-free hydration becomes pretty priceless over time. Comparing it to other options, the value-to-quality ratio is particularly strong if water is an integral part of your family's daily needs.

**Cycle summary and priorities:**

We used our mining bonus to the max this week, directing pilots to acquire systems with exceptional mineral prices. This has been really successful and we have punched above our weight for acquisitions once again, with 8 new systems, and only powers with much larger player bases exceeding our count in any significant way, including Arissa desperately trying to make up for her recent losses with many acquisitions. We wonder if the tale hides further losses however, leaving her only *net* positive. We had a hotly contested acquisition in **Puppis Sector NX-U b2-3** against the Emperor, who sidled past the erstwhile competition we'd left behind, Torval, to challenge our lead. Their efforts were insufficient, however, and we pulled hard away with final scores seeming to be at around 600,000 to 400,000. Our Federal ally Archer had to weather numerous hotly contested acquisitions vs. Aisling and Grom, but still came out ahead of both with +10 acquisitions, the third fastest growing power for the cycle. Aisling's irrational hatred of the Republican power they already so shamefully abused in PP1.0 seems to continue to fuel conflict for her. Li Yong Rui is the real outlier, gaining 39 systems to take them past Grom (+9), and with the Cmdr at the top of their leaderboard acquiring nearly 6 million merits - it's caused a little controversy that you can read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1n2bmn0/how_are_they_doing_this/). Otherwise, we gained ground upon all of our nearest neighbours in the leaderboard, with only Kaine among them managing a more substantial haul of 6 acquisitions. Well done all!

Amanda gets back to Cityton, goes home, but can't sleep. She can't process Cecilia getting away without punishment. She goes several nights without sleeping until, out of desperation, without telling John, she approaches Kerry. She tells Kerry what Cecilia does and shows her the website of the scam artist preying on the sick and desperate. 

She begs Kerry to help track Cecilia down because the thought of Cecila going free is too much for Amanda. Amanda isn't 100% upfront with Kerry but shows her a list of the people Cecilia has scammed and doomed to a painful death. At first Kerry is hesitant, but after a night of looking up Cecilia's victims and reading about their journey, via social media, through despair, hope, and posts that slow until they the victims of the snake oil saleswoman clearly die in pain, she decides over cold coffee to team up with Amanda. 

She only knows that Amanda has gone through trauma after escaping a trap. Throughout the movie, Kerry bonds with the Jigsaw victim turned apprentice, over Kerry's not previously disclosed abusive relationship where the guy ended up getting off scot free.  

Kerry agrees to help Amanda, initially ignoring her PD background out of anger. Amanda, feeling equal finally, begins to trauma bond with Kerry.

Amanda and Kerry eventually catch Cecilia, but Kerry threatens to shoot Amanda if she puts Cecilia in a trap, begging her to let the system judge and punish Cecilia. Amanda, having grown close to Kerry, gives in and they promise to put away people and still make them learn lessons. If the ""bad people"" redeem themselves in the system, Kerry promises rehabilitation and redemption. If they fail, Kerry promises punishment. Kerry puts Cecilia in a cop car, promising Amanda justice will win.

Cecilia, more capable than Kerry gave her credit, manages to escape and crosses the nearby state line and rushes to a PD, where they bring her to an ER.

When Amanda goes to talk to John, but in the background, the Cityton 6 o'clock news plays more loudly somehow. Both Amanda and John turn to the TV. The main story of the night is how some poor woman, named Claudia, escaped hell and managed to escape two murders. Before a reporter could follow up with ""Claudia"" she has already vanished.

John stares at Amanda while she screams in despair and anger. Then it cuts to Kerry, staring at a TV, sitting down slowly. Cut back to Amanda hyperventilating and clawing at her hair in the foreground while John tells her that no one will ever teach and provide justice like he and Amanda can.

*Linus*

*Routine*

Today started like any other. It always does. The alarm at 5:13. coffee at 5:26, three and a half teaspoons of sugar, just enough milk to change the color. I sit at my table and watch the street through the blinds. The neighborhood is waking up, cars rumbling, lights flicking on, someone yelling at a dog that won't come inside. 

I wonder if they realize how easy it is to notice the small things they try to hide. The man across the street hides a limp. The woman two houses down keeps her backdoor unlocked Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. I don't search for these things, they reveal themselves. Weakness always does, if you're paying attention.

By 5:40 the cup is finished. Routine is key.

At 6:30 I'm in the shower, water just hot enough to sting. I dress in an indigo suit, eggshell shirt, black tie. black pants. Sean at the office wears the same. No one notices. 

At 8:15 I leave the house. I hate going outside, the streets are filthy, filled with noise and movement. My neighbor greets me as I unlock my car. I smile, show teeth. People like teeth. They think it means trust. She complains to me about how her cats got out again. I nod and laugh in the right place. I think about asking her if she's checked the dumpster down the street, I don't.

I'm at work by 8:30. I work at the press office. Everyone plays their roles here, phones pressed to ears, keyboards tapping like teeth chattering in the cold. I hang my coat, greet reception, and walk to my cubicle. efficient. Professional. I don't stand out. People like me because I listen more than I speak. They think it makes me kind. It just makes them easier to catalog.

    I watch them in moments they don't realize they're being watched.

Steve's shaking his leg faster than usual, too much coffee maybe.

Marla touches her necklace when she lies.

Paul wastes his time flirting with Wanda.

I file these things away. Knowledge makes people simple. Predictable. Quiet. 

Lunch at 12:30. Always 12:30. I sit in my car and eat in silence. I chew slowly while watching the street. The filth wallows. I imagine the noise gone. Perfect silence.

By 6:00 I'm home, mug washed, tie folded, blinds drawn. Across the street a woman leaves her window cracked again, blinds tilted open. She doesn't know how clearly I can see her.

 I'm in bed by 8:00. Tomorrow will be the same again.

*Ch. 2*

*Elle*

*Escaped.* 

The first thing was the smell.

The rot. Meat. metal thick in the air, clinging to the back of my throat no matter how shallow I try to breathed.

The ropes dug into my wrists, rubbed raw from however many hours or days I'd been tied here.

He was asleep.

I shimmied the knots loose. The rope fell away, leaving red rings burned into my skin. For a moment, I just sat there in the dark basement, staring at the pale, swinging bodies strung up on meat hooks. Their glassy eyes stared at nothing, their mouths hung open as if mid scream.

    I forced myself to stand, legs trembling, bare feet pattering on the cold concrete.

Every shadow seemed alive. Every creak of the old wood above felt like footsteps. I swallowed down a sob and moved, weaving between the fridges that hummed low and sickly, their handles crusted with something dark. I didn't dare to open them. 

I didn't need to.

    The basement door loomed ahead. I pushed it open slow enough that the hinges barely groaned, then I slipped into the hallway. The air was warmer here, filled with the faint smell of mold and sweat.
    
    Step by step I made my way through the house. My ears rang with silence. My pulse was so loud I thought it might wake him. The front door was just there, a rectangle of black against a darker wall. 

My hand gripped the doorknob. Cold metal against my clammy skin. I started to turn it.

That's when I heard it.

A bed creaking.

Floorboards groaning.

The sound of weight shifting, then silence.

I froze, every muscle locked. My breath stuck in my throat.

Then, fast. Too fast. Drawers yanked open. The scrape of wood. Cloth, heavy, being pulled over skin. No muttering, no groan of exhaustion, just sharp movement. precise . urgent.

A floorboard screamed. Footsteps now, fast, coming closer.

I yanked the door open, the wood moaning like a wounded animal. I slipped in the night, heart hammering, feet bare on the gravel. I didn't look back. I couldn't.

Footsteps followed, precise and fast. I felt them more than I heard them, thudding somewhere in the house. The sack mask must be on. I could sense him.

    I ran without thinking, stumbling over roots,stepping on glass or rocks, ignoring the pain.

A dog barked somewhere behind me, sharp and sudden, and I flinched.

The sound carried, but it wasn't him, yet it reminded me how alone I was.

How helpless.

My feet scraped the pavement.

Then I saw it, a corner where I could disappear. A side street, dark and empty. I veered sharply, catching the curb with my toes. Gravel sprayed as I pivoted. A car drove past where I was hidden.

My chest ached, lungs on fire. My feet were bleeding. But I kept hidden.

*Ch. 3*

*Chase*

*Analysis.*       

The phone rang in the dead silence of my office. I didn't answer immediately. I knew the tone, the rhythm, the urgency behind it. I didn't need to hear the words to know something was wrong.

“Detective Chase,"" I said, voice low, distracted.

An officer's voice came through, tight and hurried. “Sir. you need to come. Now. Behind the grander diner. In the forest. Multiple bodies. Still being found. We… we think its-”

“The gray killer,” I said before he could finish. 

Silence on the line. Then, ""how'd you?”

“Patterns speak louder than words,” I said, jotting the address in my notebook, already getting a jacket on and sketching a crude map of the area with angles, tree lines, and potential escape routes. My fingers tapped the page, moving faster than my thoughts could catch up.

    By the time I arrived, the sun was dipping low, shadows stretching between the trees. The gore was the first thing I saw. It made my stomach twist. I didn't flinch. I cataloged. Soaked in the information.

Workers had already unearthed a few shallow graves. Bodies, so many, some complete, some partial, dirt still clinging to the skin. The work crew stepped back as I approached. I crouched beside the first body, sketching its position in my notebook.

Notes, angles, spacing, orientation. Each grave told a story. Ritual. Method. Control.

    I murmured to myself as I worked, though I wasn't sure if I was talking aloud or in my head. “Too deliberate. Too careful. The gray killer isn't sloppy. Not random. This is calculated. planned.” 
    
    Behind me, the forest was quiet, almost too quiet. A breeze whispered through the trees. My eyes flicked to every shadow. Every movement, no matter how small, it was information. Even the birds, even the leaves.

I didn't notice the uniformed officer walking closer until he cleared his throat. “Sir… do you… do you think we’ll catch him?” I stood up without looking at the officer.

“I dunno yet. Have we interviewed anyone working in the restaurant?”

He shook his head.

“No, I don't think we have.”

“Perfect” I say walking over to the diner.

    I stepped into the back of Grander's, the smell of coffee and syrup still lingering in the air, almost clashing with the smell from outside. Normally William, my partner, handles this part. His charisma, and his easy smile. Talking to people came naturally to him. He could make anyone spill secrets without even trying.

Not me.

I cleared my throat, adjusted my glasses, and muttered, “ I need a list of your people who worked tonight. All deliveries. All employees. Times. Oh, and camera if you've got it.” My pen tapped the notebook in an uneven rhythm.  

    The manager, a thin man with nervous eyes, shifted from foot to foot. “Uh… yes, sir… I mean detective. Of course. you'll have it-”
    
    I interrupted him with a finger, not to be rude but to control the tempo. “Step by step. Start from opening. Every detail matters. Every person. I don't need speculation. I need the facts.”
    
    He swallowed hard. “Right. Okay… well, the prep cooks, two waitresses, i clocked the dishwasher leaving at…” his voice trailed off as I leaned in, my eyes piercing his, counting every second of hesitation.
    
    “Names,” I said, tapping the notebook. My hand moved faster than my brain as I recorded each one. I didn't smile. I didn't nod. I didn't pretend to empathize. I cataloged. Each human reaction, every twitch, every glance. Was just more data.
    
    A waitress shifted in her seat nervously. “Detective… you want us to… what? Point out everyone who was here?”
    
    “Yes” I responded quickly, “and note anything unusual. Odd deliveries. Packages left in the back. Anything missing.” My pen tapped again, faster. The cadence sounded almost like a heartbeat. “Even small anomalies are important.
    
    She nodded, uneasy, and scribbled in her own pad.

I start to walk away “everyone, write down anything and i mean anything that you've seen, write it down and call this number”

I hand the manager, the waitress and others near me.

    William would have smoothed this over, distracted them with a joke. But I am not William. I do not charm. He connects the dots with people. 

I connect them with corpses.

*Ch. 4*

*Linus*

*I think im being watched.*

Work.

The word itself feels chained around my neck. My shoes click against the tile floor of the lobby, sharp and even, though my hands twitch against my coat sleeve. A few heads lift as I pass. I keep my posture straight, shoulders back, voice measured when I offer the customary greetings.

“Morning.”

“Good afternoon.”

“Sir.” with a nod.

Every syllable is weighed, careful, and formal. They can't see what rattles inside me. I know they all know. They have to. How can they not?

    My desk sits at the end of the long hall, tucked neat and sterile in between two other cubicles.

I set my briefcase down, straighten my tie, smooth the papers stacked in front of me. My colleagues murmur nearby, low voices about trivialities. Weekend plans, weather, rumors of a raise. I nod at the right times, speak when spoken to, every word clipped and deliberate.

The day dragged. Phones rang, reports stacked. I sat through meeting I barely heard. At one point someone made a joke and I laughed a second too late. A few flaked toward me. Just tired, I told myself. Nothing more.

    Around four, when the office thinned out, I drifted toward the back terminals. Not the one I usually use. A different one. It was easy enough to justify.

I told the intern I needed to double-check for an upcoming brief. She didn't question it. They never do.

    I scanned the feeds faster than necessary, eyes darting over headlines. Political infighting, a bank collapse overseas, a new drug epidemic. Then something slows my heartbeat. Eight bodies found behind Granders diner.
    
    I read and reread the words. Eight bodies. Buried. Still being discovered. My pulse picks up, but outwardly I remain composed. Fingers tapping, pen positioned over a notebook I didn't really need. I memorize the phrasing, the placement, the way the words linger on the screen like a shadow.

I scroll again. Notes on police activity, reports filed. The details are sparse, sterile. Yet enough. Enough to make me pause. Enough to make me check the monitor twice.

Routine. professionalism. Control. Control. Control. 

    I close the terminal, restore everything exactly as it was. Nothing disturbed. Nothing traced. Perfect.
    
    Back in the car, I circle the block not once. Not Twice. eight. eight times. My eyes flick over every reflection in the darkened windows, every movement in the shadows. The streetlamps split the wet pavement into bands of light and dark. I drive slowly, deliberately. Looking for patterns. Looking for anomalies. Looking for something.

By the eighth pass, I stop at a red light. Rain drips from my coat onto the leather steering wheel. The reflection of my face is pale and still. Hands folded, tie slightly loosened, jaw tight. Eight bodies. Eight.

Home is quiet. Too quiet

And yet. Almost nothing.

*Ch. 5*

*Elle*

*Some help.*

The bus let me off near the edge of town, a hissing of brakes and wet tires. Rain hammered the streets, blurring neon lights into long streaks of color across the pavement. I pulled my jacket tighter, shoulders hunched, shivering. The time was seven-thirty, maybe eight. The kind of night that makes you wish the world would just swallow you whole.

    I spotted a gas station up ahead. The lights flickering behind wet glass. I made my way over, slipping on the puddled sidewalk. My stomach growled. My wrists ached from long hours of gripping nothing. I could barely remember the last time I had eaten anything real.
    
    Inside, the warmth hit me first, then the smell of coffee and stale chips. I stepped up to the counter, head low.

“Please… anything. Food, money… something,” I said. My voice was smaller than I wanted

The store owner, a man with tired eyes and a thin mustache, squinted at me “sorry lady, I got nothing for you. If you're not buying anything, get out.”

    I nodded quickly. “Right. Sorry,” I muttered, backing toward the door. But I noticed the cashier distracted by a small TV facing away from me. My pulse hammered, but only for a second. I couldn't go to the police he had to much dirt on me. And. And he knows my family. I slipped to the back of the store, hands trembling, grabbed a sandwich, a bag of chips, and shoved them into my jacket.

I hurried out and stepped back into the rain, heart hammering. No one had seen. No one had noticed.

    I kept moving, boots slick against the wet pavement, until a dim bar sign flickered in the distance called the white crow. Someone was standing outside, leaning against the wall, smoke floating from a cigarette. Obviously drunk. I hesitated, unsure. But hunger and cold made me approach.

He looked at me, gave a half-smile. “You look like you need help,” he said.

“I… maybe. I don't know,” I replied, keeping my voice small.

    “Names William,"" he said. He took a long drag of the cigarette, exhaling smoke into the rain. “Dont worry. I won't bite.”
    
    I nodded, shoving my hands into my jacket pockets. The rain ran down my sleeves, soaking the sandwich I had stolen. I didn't speak about why I was here. Didn't speak about anyone. Didn't speak about anything I shouldn't.
    
    “Listen, it seems you're not in a good place.” William said, reaching into his coat and pulling out a card, slipping it into my hand. “Detective. Names chase. He…. He's a good friend, helps people. If you ever need it.”
    
    I stared at the card. I didn't ask questions. I didn't say anything. I only nodded, letting the wet plastic slide between my fingers.
    
    The rain hit harder, drumming on my hood. William tipped his cigarette, disappeared into the night. I tucked the card into my pocket, pulled my jacket tighter, and walked on.

The streets were slick with rain when I arrived at The White Crow. Neon reflected across the puddles like fractured glass. I didn't bother parking in front. Visibility isn't always a virtue, and sometimes blending in is preferable.

    Inside, the bar smelled of stale beer and burnt wood. Music pulsed faintly, not enough to mask conversation, but enough to distort it. I moved to the counter, tapping the edge with long fingers, eyes scanning.
    
    The bartender noticed me immediately. I don't think anyone misses my presence for long. “Evening detective,” he said.

“Has William been in?” I asked. My voice low, precise, measured.

    The bartender shrugged. “Yeah. left about forty eight minutes ago. Headed home, I'd guess. Seemed… fine.” he wiped a glass with a rag, not meeting my eyes.

“Fine.” I repeated the word under my breath. Fine is never fine.

    I left the bar, rain already soaking my coat, and drove the familiar route to Williams house. 

His lights were out. I stepped out of the car and knocked sharply. Knocked again. No answer. Fingers traced the window frames. locked. Blinds drawn. Not unusual, but still…

    Through the glass of the living room window, I saw him. William, passed out on the floor. I lifted the window carefully and slipped inside. The smell hit me first. Alcohol, smoke. My eyes swept the room, cataloguing, assessing risk, safety, necessity.
    
    When I got a better look at William I saw scattered bottles around him and a revolver rested nearby, chamber was clicked open. it only had one bullet.

“William,” I said softly. He stirred, eyes half-lidded, confusion and recognition flickering across his face.

    I crouched and reached for him. “Come on. Up we go.”

He groaned, body heavy and pliable. I guided him to his bed, careful not to jostle anything else. He collapsed into the mattress,

    “I… guess I just… fell asleep,” he mumbled, voice rough with whiskey. “Didn't mean to get.. Like this.”
    
    ""You've been asking for trouble.” I said, softening my tone. “One bullet, one slip, and I wouldn't be here helping you.”
    
    He gave a weak chuckle, stretching one arm over his eyes. “You always have to lecture me, huh?”

I turned his way, sitting on the edge of the bed. “Someone has to keep you alive.”

    The room fell silent for a moment, rain tapping the roof. We'd known each other too long to need small talk. Almost brothers.
    
    “Why haven't you been around?” I asked, letting the silence linger, my fingers tapping lightly yet rabidly against my knees. “You've missed a lot at work. The gray killer… he's picked up again.”
    
    He groaned. “Work… can't say I've been… motivated lately. You know how it is.”
    
    “I know exactly how it is,” I said, voice soft but firm. “But the gray killer doesn't care about motivation. Multiple bodies behind Grander’s. Still being found. Patterns everywhere, William. Patterns. We’re supposed to be noticing them before the public gets rowdy or starts asking questions.”
    
    He squinted at me, trying to focus. “Yeah… I heard… a few things. But… cant follow it all. You know me.”
    
    “I do,” I said. “But that's why I need you at your best. We need all eyes open. Observations. Anything unusual, anywhere. You slipping up puts more on me. And you know I don't play fair with that kind of weight.”
    
    He shifted in the bed, face pale but alert. “I… I'll try. I'll be better.”
    
    “I don't want try,” I said, fixing my glasses. “ I want results. We're looking at a killer who’s precise, calculated. Not sloppy. Not random. Y'know how these minds work, patterns hidden in plain sight. I need you to be steady.”
    
    He nodded slowly. “Okay… okay, chase. Ill… ill get back on the swing. Promise.”
    
    I leaned back slightly, letting the tension ease. “Good. and william… you know im not lecturing. I care. Like loads. We’re basically brothers, we've been through it.”
    
    He smiled faintly, eyes half-closed. “Yeah… almost brothers. Guess that makes you the annoying one.”
    
    “Because I have to be,” I said. The corner of my mouth twitched “now rest. We’ve got bodies to track, patterns to uncover, and you ""I pointed at him lightly “your going to be doing the talking, because I can't be doing that shit again.”
    
    He groaned. Settling back. I stayed a moment longer, cataloguing his breathing, the bottles, the gun, in the living room. Then I rose, adjusting my glasses, leaving silent. Outside, rain still drummed on the roof. The town was alive with chaos, and we had work to do.",1,1756418392.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

She can't process Cecilia getting away without punishment. She goes several nights without sleeping until, out of desperation, without telling John, she approaches Kerry. She tells Kerry what Cecilia does and shows her the website of the scam artist preying on the sick and desperate. 

She begs Kerry to help track Cecilia down because the thought of Cecila going free is too much for Amanda. Amanda isn't 100% upfront with Kerry but shows her a list of the people Cecilia has scammed and doomed to a painful death. At first Kerry is hesitant, but after a night of looking up Cecilia's victims and reading about their journey, via social media, through despair, hope, and posts that slow until they the victims of the snake oil saleswoman clearly die in pain, she decides over cold coffee to team up with Amanda. 

She only knows that Amanda has gone through trauma after escaping a trap. Throughout the movie, Kerry bonds with the Jigsaw victim turned apprentice, over Kerry's not previously disclosed abusive relationship where the guy ended up getting off scot free.  

Kerry agrees to help Amanda, initially ignoring her PD background out of anger. Amanda, feeling equal finally, begins to trauma bond with Kerry.

Amanda and Kerry eventually catch Cecilia, but Kerry threatens to shoot Amanda if she puts Cecilia in a trap, begging her to let the system judge and punish Cecilia. Amanda, having grown close to Kerry, gives in and they promise to put away people and still make them learn lessons. If the ""bad people"" redeem themselves in the system, Kerry promises rehabilitation and redemption. If they fail, Kerry promises punishment. Kerry puts Cecilia in a cop car, promising Amanda justice will win.

Cecilia, more capable than Kerry gave her credit, manages to escape and crosses the nearby state line and rushes to a PD, where they bring her to an ER.

When Amanda goes to talk to John, in the background, the Cityton 6 o'clock news plays more loudly somehow. Both Amanda and John turn to the TV. The main story of the night is how some poor woman, named ""Claudia"", escaped hell and managed to escape two murders. Before a reporter could follow up with ""Claudia"" she has already vanished.

John stares at Amanda while she screams in despair and anger. Then it cuts to Kerry, staring at a TV, sitting down slowly. Cut back to Amanda hyperventilating and clawing at her hair in the foreground while John tells her that no one will ever teach and provide justice like he and Amanda can.

Silent witch is the only anime I know with research math vibes,"I'm a mathematician, and the premise of Monica drew me in immediately. I don't mean that Monica is extremely introverted, but that she is a mathematician through and through. I feel like this is the first series that correctly represents academic mathematicians.

I acknowledge other series that use mathematics or mathematical problems, like Assassination Classroom in that episode with the crystal structure, that scientist romcom where they started to solve the traveling salesman problem, or Doctor Stone in that iconic moment where he beat Chrome in arithmetic. But sadly, these moments are short and they convey science and math olympiad vibes rather than academic research vibes.   

To mention some examples in Silent Witch, there are the gigantic stacks of paper with calculations. There's the coffee set that Monica clearly cares for. I was happy to see that Monica's knowledge does not (only) come from talent but more likely from those big stacks of books she has in her hut. I love the scene where the dad tells her that he won't be finished once the calculations are over, as there is always more to research. Or (most obviously) Monica's habit of analyzing everything she sees mathematically, like the prince's brooch.

Depending on how the series goes, it might become my favorite series. But sadly, I feel that in recent episodes, the math vibes have fallen off in order to introduce new characters.

I (26 F) and my fiance (35 M) are (were?) expecting our very first baby. This was not planned, however we were both excited and happy to welcome a baby into our lives. My fiance is getting older and so am I, so we were over the moon at the idea of having a child. I found out I was pregnant Friday night after 2 weeks of no period. I have suffered with PCOS since I was 14 years old so I assumed the lack of a menstrual cycle in August had something to do with it. Even though my period had been consistent for about a year, I did not think I would be able to get pregnant, ever.

I was just so shocked and happy when I found out. The weekend was a bliss and I made the mistake of telling my parents and my sister about it. Everyone was more than happy for us. On Monday, I got my bloodwork examined and it turns out I am (was?) 4 weeks pregnant. hCg hormone level was at around a 190. 

I started spotting Tuesday morning when I woke up to get ready for work. It was light brown/light pink and absolutely no pain. Maybe a bit of pressure but never painful. It lasted all day, a little heavier but still light in color. Wednesday AM was as if I had stopped spotting all together. Clean wipe and all. I came back from work and decided to go to the bathroom, it was as if I had gotten my menstrual cycle. So much bright red blood everywhere and I panicked. I ended up in the ER where they did drew more blood, performed an abdominal ultrasound and a transvaginal ultrasound. From what I recall from the previous night, my scans showed that I was in fact still pregnant, they were able to see the gestational sac inside my uterus, but that they could not hear a heartbeat. I was not told if it was because the baby is too small or because there was no baby anymore. 

I have been extremely devastated. I just break down crying during the day. My hCg levels were down to 75. They sent me home to monitor the bleeding with a pad. It is not filling up at all, nowhere near. I am not ""bleeding out"" but now the bleeding is light red/sometimes red. No clots. But I feel hopeless. I just wish I had had more time with my baby. I regret not taking a pregnancy test sooner. I regret everything I did before I found out I was pregnant. All the coffee I drank or the stress that work caused me. I should've been more gentle or cared for myself more. 

I have an appointment tomorrow to get blood drawn again to check if my levels have gone down yet again. I am guessing if they are lower then I lost my baby. Follow up with my OBGYN on Tuesday.

1n2pe82,https://www.reddit.com/r/mclaren/comments/1n2pe82/owners_review_mclaren_gts_2026_1_month_later/,Owner's Review: McLaren GTS 2026 (1 month later),"Hey everyone,

So, after a month with my new **2026 McLaren GTS**, I decided to share my impressions and conclusions with the community.

**WHY MCLAREN**

Regarding the purchase decision or ""why McLaren,"" you could say it was my only non-hybrid option if you want a new, internal combustion engine car with more than a V6 (like the MC20). Ferrari only offered me the 296GTB, and Lamborghini isn't making pure ICE cars anymore. As for Porsche, I already owned one for 5 years and was in the mood for something more exotic and different.

**COMPARING THE 750S vs. GTS**

This brings us to the test drive at McLaren. I got to try out a McLaren GTS and a 750S Spider on some mountain roads. Let's start with the differences between them. I'd sum it up by saying the **GTS gives you about 75% of the 750S experience**, plus an extra helping of comfort, cargo space, and ground clearance.

* **Strong points of the 750S over the GTS:**
   1. The downshifts are way more brutal and emotional in the 750S. They're addictive, and it's something I'd definitely add to the GTS if I could. Similarly, the gearbox felt sharper and sportier in all modes (Comfort, Sport, Track).
   2. Steering. Even though it's hydraulic like the GTS, it feels a bit more precise and less stiff. It's more pleasant to use.
   3. The roof. If a GTS Spider existed, it would have been the pinnacle of perfection.

Aside from those points—which everyone has to decide for themselves if they're worth the +$100k difference over the base price—we're looking at two models that share pretty much the same foundation: carbon fiber chassis, gearbox, and engine. But they have a different setup (more aggressive in the 750S) and a different ""outfit"" (more elegant in the GTS). On the other hand, the 750S came out in 2023, and the **GTS in 2024, with the latter incorporating the latest in ICE tech and electronic bug fixes.**

For all these reasons, **I ended up going with the 2026 McLaren GTS**, which includes some new cosmetic touches like customizable colored seatbelts and a few other aesthetic tweaks. I loved the brutality of the 750S, and its convertible roof even more, but I just didn't feel that experience was worth an extra +€100k. Plus, where I live, it's packed with McLarens, and the 720/750 is an extremely common sight, while you barely see any GT/GTS models, let alone in a distinctive color like McLaren Orange or Papaya Spark.

**CONFIGURING THE MCLAREN GTS**

Spec'ing out the GTS with the sales rep was a pretty pleasant experience. We added all the extras except the exterior carbon fiber kit. I was surprised that we managed to get most of the stuff for free by pushing the sales rep a bit (e.g., the lift system, side badges, car cover...). The final net price without VAT or taxes, with all the extras, came out to be **around $250k (netto).**

**OWNER'S CONCLUSIONS (1 MONTH LATER)**

* **THINGS I LIKE**
   * **It's a sports car, not a Grand Tourer (GT).** It's the least ""GT"" GT I've ever had the chance to drive. We're talking about a supposed GT that has a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, a mid-engine layout, 2 seats instead of a 2+2 setup, a ridiculous low weight, carbon-ceramic brakes... clearly not the typical architecture of a classic Grand Tourer (M8, Continental, GT 4-Door, DBS....). If McLaren had called this car literally anything else, I have no doubt it would sell more and be seen as an entry-level model, like the Artura but without the hybrid stuff.
   * **Comfort.** The suspension is seriously effective. Even in the sportiest Track mode, it goes over bumps and speed humps with barely any effort. The advanced suspension tech is surprising; it's undeniably more effective and smoother than my daily driver, a BMW M850i, in its Comfort mode.
   * **Daily driver potential.** You can easily daily this car. The lift system raises the GTS to 132mm of ground clearance, letting you get over pretty much anything and making it higher than most BMW M cars without a lift.
   * **Sound.** I was surprised by how good the GTS sounds when the valves open up past 3000 RPM in Sport/Track mode. The sound is really evocative and angry. It's not the high-pitched scream of an Italian V12, but it sounds better than I expected for the GTS. Still, I'd say a muffler delete is pretty necessary on this car to get that sound in a wider range of situations.
   * **McLaren quality details.** Small but quality touches, like offering brake calipers with a 3D-machined logo (compared to a simple sticker on a Ferrari), or the standard carbon-ceramic brakes, the carbon monocoque, the dihedral doors, the old-school hydraulic steering, a small and thin steering wheel... these are things that, while seeming insignificant, add brand value to the car and set it apart from the competition.
   * **Striking aesthetics.** Despite the saying that the GT/GTS is the only McLaren that James Bond would drive, behind that elegance lies a pretty exotic presence. Precisely because the model is so rare due to low sales, a GTS in an exotic, eye-catching color attracts a huge number of curious onlookers, stares, and questions about what model it is. Most people don't even know it's a McLaren since it lacks the typical front end. For reference, at local Cars & Coffee meets, the GTS draws more of a crowd than the 720/750S.
   * **Dihedral doors.** They're convenient and light (they're power-assisted), and despite my initial reservations about them, especially when it comes to parking in public places and not being able to get into my car, I've never had a problem. You just have to be a little more careful about where you park.
   * **Sporty driving feel on mountain passes.** Twisty roads aren't the typical place you'd drive a supposed Grand Tourer, but the GTS feels really fun and passionate even on the most winding mountain passes. It stays glued to the asphalt at all times, feels very direct and visceral, doesn't feel heavy, and the hydraulic steering offers on-rails guidance and is 100% communicative. It's extremely fun to drive on twisty roads, more so than a 718 GT4.
   * **Feel of the carbon paddle shifters.** McLaren plays with the size of the paddle shifters depending on which interior carbon pack you choose. The standard plastic paddles are a bit small and feel just ""okay,"" but if you opt for the carbon fiber paddles, McLaren gives you these giant, comfortable paddles that have a really addictive ""click."" They're a pleasure to use.
* **THINGS TO IMPROVE**
   * The **infotainment system is way too basic** by today's standards. It doesn't support CarPlay or Android Auto, and the navigation system is totally useless. Luckily, it seems they've fixed the system freezing issues, or at least, I haven't experienced them yet. That said, the B&W audio system sounds excellent and has great quality.
   * The **downshifts are excessively conservative**. There are no pops or bangs, no simulated heel-and-toe, no drama whatsoever. A GTI hot hatch has more passionate downshifts, including my own M850i.
   * Although it has a lot of cargo space in the trunk with the power hatch, its **weird shapes** due to the engine housing make it impossible to load most things unless you buy the custom-fitted luggage set offered by the brand.
   * **The ESC (stability control) is one of the most intrusive** I've ever tried in a supercar. It kicks in constantly at the slightest hint of throttle, even when pulling away slightly spiritedly from a standstill. I get that this is done on purpose for novice drivers or those new to supercars with the GTS. The solution is simple: you have to put the ESC in DYN mode, which is possible in Sport or Track modes. In ESC DYN, it becomes less intrusive and lets you drive as normally as you would in the 750S.
   * **Ergonomics and tech.** There are some questionable design decisions inside, like the hidden and inaccessible location of the power seat adjustment buttons, or the lack of USB-C ports, and only 1x USB-A port.
   * **The electrochromic roof.** It was an $8000 option, and while it's useful and does its job, I feel like it's not as innovative or incredible as it initially seemed. In the lightest mode, it doesn't let that much light in (it's tinted), and in the darkest mode, it doesn't get that dark. It left me with a bittersweet feeling.
   * **Exhaust Sound.** Like I said before, the GTS sounds nice, but it's lacking in volume and needs a more noticeable valve opening across the entire rev range. This model would really benefit from a good aftermarket exhaust or a muffler delete if you want to keep the warranty.

**CONCLUSIONS**

The McLaren GTS is an extremely fun and enjoyable supercar to drive on any type of road, and it's **more of a pure sports car than a Grand Tourer**. Its versatility allows you to use it comfortably in the city, on the highway, and on mountain passes, or even for the occasional track day. It's a really well-balanced car that offers incredible value for its current price, providing an old-school setup that's almost impossible to find today (hydraulic steering + RWD + ICE). The dihedral doors and its less-common aesthetic still give it an exotic look that generates a lot of interest and stares. **Overall, it's a recommended purchase, and I would do it all over again.**",9,1756417848.0,mclaren,1,1.0,False

So then I have the other following options, a plastic jug that filters the tap, a large size blue plastic jug to fill at the grocery store, smaller plastic jugs from the drug store or a 24 pack of plastic bottled water. I’m at a loss for a solution to getting my water in a plastic free format! Any suggestions other than drinking tap? Call me paranoid but I’m starting to feel like we are being poisoned with plastic.

Currently trading at 3-3.2$ a share and I am convinced it will be trading above 100$ within a five to ten year time horizon.

Fundamentals and Overview Richtech defines their company mission as, “By harnessing the power of collaborative robotic solutions, Richtech is redefining the service industry landscape. Our mission is to drive a revolutionary automation of tasks, enhancing customer experiences, and enabling businesses to unlock their full potential.”

“Richtech Robotics partners with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Connect program to integrate NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing technologies, such as the Jetson Orin platform and Isaac Sim, into their service robots like Adam and Scorpion. This collaboration enhances Richtech's robots with improved body movement detection accuracy, faster development times through simulation, and more efficient navigation in complex environments. The partnership aims to accelerate Richtech's mission to make AI-driven service robots a common sight in industries such as hospitality, retail, and restaurants.” As we have seen over the last five to ten years, NVIDIA has become the industry leader in the AI and semiconductor market. With a market cap of over 4.4 trillion dollars, NVIDIA is positioned to the backbone of the technological landscape for the foreseeable future. Because of this, NVIDIA will be able to consistently supply Richtech with the most up to date technology for their line of robotics. Additionally, NVIDIA has a 50% voting share of the company so will be able to guide them financially as they make their transition from unprofitable to profitable.

Market Opportunity A majority of my positive sentiment comes from the FACT that low-skill jobs will be phased out of existence within a 10-20 year time horizon. I believe trade skills will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets. Enough about NVIDIA, let’s continue to discuss RR’s market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe Robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples Steve Balmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.” Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution,

This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that people often side towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics), not denounce it. Don’t be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech’s competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the robotic revolution that I believe is coming. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030. Future Potential I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. The recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech’s 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you’ve got a company that isn’t just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively. On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50–$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they’ll reconsider. This poses a good buying opportunity for us, as just as Steve Balmer said about the iPhone, public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to “capture the market share.” All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia’s CEO, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia’s scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go: Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at \~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you’re in for being a long-term HODL the bag regard, I have unwavering faith that RR could be your Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.",1,1756417536.0,ArmBotTestSub,1,1.0,False

First, I know I have a gift; it's one of those things that I have known since I was a child, but didn't have a way to explain it to others. Looking into it, I have the spiritual gift of mercy; I am empathetic almost to a fault. I genuinely feel others emotions, especially when its extreme: pain, anxiety, excitement, joy, fear, etc. If I'm in a room during a highly emotional time (i.e. weddings, funerals, etc.) I have a hard time because I can't tell what I'm feeling versus what someone else is feeling. I sometimes have to leave the room if too many people get worked up. 

I also tend to get honest answers to ""how are you doing?"" from literal strangers. In coffee shops, work, or in line at the grocery store, you name it - people generally feel very comfortable talking to me, crying on my shoulder, or letting me hold their hands or hug them. 

About a year ago my husband and I joined a new church which has been phenomenal. It has challenged me a lot by pushing me to build my own relationship with God through scripture, prayer, and trying to be more like Jesus every day. 

Though the church has been great to us, I started having issues a few months ago, with dreams. They are of demonic attacks on me and my immediate family members. I spoke to the leader of our church because I was unsure what all this meant (it was a series of dreams over a week, and I was scared to sleep). He spoke to me about whether or not I had ever seen myself as an intercessor and to continue to pray on behalf of my family. The more I prayed, the worse my sleep became and I was becoming a bit depressed. 

So we (the church) fasted and prayers in the sanctuary every night for Holy Week. The dreams stopped, but then came the need to touch people (like hold or lay my hands on them). My hands literally had pins and needs and became warm around certain people during those prayer events. I tried very hard to ignore it because I kept thinking to myself ""I can't go around hugging and touching strangers!"" 

The third night that week we prayed specifically for survivors of abuse. The feeling was so intense to go hold and pray for this woman sitting in the next isle over I couldn't help it and asked to pray with her. As soon as I touched her she fell into my arms sobbing and I just started... praying. To this day barely remember what I said, but when I released her I nearly fell over, but the feeling was gone.

It's happened a few times since then. Someone walks by me and I get the feeling in my hands, something drawing me to them. I actually have to restrain myself sometimes, because I know how awkward it would be to just have someone hug you and tell you they feel your pain, anxiety, despair, etc. 

The honest problem is that I don’t feel ready for this type of gift. I believe having such a gift comes with great responsibility and I am still struggling with being who I want to be in my faith. I just don’t feel… worthy. Like, who me a person who is fighting her own battles and demons should be used to heal others? I know I don’t have to be perfect, but shouldn’t I be like… better?

Then for thinking this way I feel guilty. God’s given me something to help others and I am afraid to use it. I know he did not give us a spirit of fear. I just want to be doing it right. 

I’d appreciate any suggestions, encouragement, or advice. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Grand Slam clash that’s as lopsided as a vending machine’s diet soda selection: Aryna Sabalenka, the defending U.S. Open champion and world No. 1, faces Leylah Fernandez in a rematch of their 2021 semi-final. Back then, Fernandez served up an upset so shocking, it made a slow Wi-Fi connection seem reliable. But this time? The odds suggest Sabalenka is less “vulnerable underdog” and more “unstoppable force in a tennis skirt.” Let’s break it down with the precision of a line umpire on espresso.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Sabalenka’s Implied Probability Feels Like 99% (Minus the Thrill of Upsets)

The bookmakers are practically handing Sabalenka the trophy before the match starts. Her decimal odds hover between **1.13 and 1.17**, translating to an implied probability of **85-87%**. For context, that’s the statistical confidence of a vending machine working on the first try. Leylah Fernandez? She’s priced between **5.2 and 5.8**, implying a **15-17%** chance—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of my morning coffee order.

The spread bets (Sabalenka -5.5 games) and total game lines (20 games, even) further cement Sabalenka’s dominance. If this were a Netflix sports docuseries, Fernandez’s subplot would be titled *“The Long Shot: A Tragicomic Tale.”*

---

### News Digest: Sabalenka’s “I’ve Changed” Speech vs. Fernandez’s “I’ll Try Harder” Vow

Sabalenka, the three-time Grand Slam champion, is playing with the confidence of someone who just bought a lifetime supply of pizza. She’s shrugged off her 2021 loss to Fernandez like it was a pesky mosquito, declaring she’s “a better player and person” and “super excited” to face her rival again. Her recent win over Polina Kudermetova was so clinical, it made a spreadsheet weep with joy.

Fernandez, meanwhile, is the underdog with a résumé that reads like a “What If?” novel. She’s won a WTA title this year (in Washington, no less) but hasn’t advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam since 2022. Her path to glory feels like a toaster trying to bake a strudel—\*ambitious, b

You sit there like a mummy, trying not to move, holding your face still so the mask doesn’t peel off. Sound familiar? Yeah, I’ve been there too—frustrating, right? That’s where the **Lindo Silimask - Reusable Anti-Wrinkle Silicone Face Mask Holder** comes in, and trust me, it changes the game.

This isn’t just another “skincare gadget” that ends up in the bathroom drawer graveyard. Nope. This little silicone hero actually works, and I’m low-key obsessed. Let’s talk about why it’s worth your attention.

---

## What Exactly Is the Lindo Silimask?

The Lindo Silimask is basically a **silicone face mask cover** that you wear *over* your regular sheet mask. Think of it as a second skin that holds everything in place. Instead of your mask sliding off while you sip tea, scroll Instagram, or scare the dog, this silicone layer keeps it snug.

Even better? It’s **reusable**. Wash it, dry it, and use it again. Goodbye one-and-done products, hello sustainable beauty tool.

👉 Curious already? You can check it out here: [Lindo Silimask - Reusable Anti-Wrinkle Silicone Face Mask Holder for Sheet Masks](https://amzn.to/45UhzID)

---

## Why Should You Even Bother With a Silicone Mask Holder?

Good question. I mean, we’ve survived years of floppy sheet masks—so why fix what’s “not broken”? Well, let me explain.

* **Better Absorption:** The Silimask locks the sheet mask against your skin, so the serum actually soaks in instead of evaporating into thin air.
* **Hands-Free Masking:** Want to fold laundry, type an email, or binge Netflix while masking? You can.
* **Less Waste:** Since the Silimask helps your skin absorb more, you’re not wasting that expensive serum dripping down your neck.
* **Reusable & Eco-Friendly:** Unlike sheet masks, you don’t toss it after one use. Wash it, hang it to dry, and it’s ready for round two. Or twenty.

Seriously—have you ever noticed how much of that juicy serum ends up on your chest or the couch pillow instead of your face? Total waste.

---

## How Do You Actually Use It?

It’s laughably simple.

1. Apply your regular sheet mask.
2. Place the Silimask over it, hooking it around your ears.
3. Go about your life without the constant fear of your mask sliding into your coffee.

After 15–20 minutes, remove it, peel off your sheet mask, and wash the Silimask with warm soapy water. Done.

No complicated setup, no batteries, no fuss. Honestly, it’s easier than remembering your Netflix password.

---

## My Personal Experience (Spoiler: I’m Sold)

The first time I tried it, I actually laughed. It felt a little weird putting silicone on my face—like a fancy Halloween costume. But within two minutes, I forgot I was wearing it.

And the results? My skin felt **way more hydrated** than usual. The sheet mask serum seemed to sink in better instead of just evaporating while I scrolled TikTok. Plus, I could actually move around without the mask peeling off. Win-win.

Honestly, the freedom to multitask while masking is underrated. I’ve folded laundry, typed emails, and even snacked on chips—all while wearing it. (Yes, I ate chips with a mask on. Don’t judge.) :)

## Key Features You’ll Love

Let’s break down what makes this little gadget worth it:

* **Reusable Silicone Material** – Soft, durable, and eco-friendly.
* **Ear Hooks** – Keep it in place without slipping.
* **Fits Most Faces** – Flexible enough to adjust to different shapes.
* **Anti-Wrinkle Effect** – Keeps the sheet mask smooth against your skin, reducing creasing.
* **Budget-Friendly** – Buy once, use countless times.

It’s one of those rare beauty tools that’s both practical *and* affordable.

---

## Lindo Silimask vs. Regular Sheet Masks Alone

So, is it really worth the hype? Let’s compare:

**Regular Sheet Mask Alone:**

* Slips off if you move.
* Serum evaporates faster.
* You sit like a statue for 20 minutes.

**Sheet Mask + Lindo Silimask:**

* Stays locked in place (even if you sneeze).
* Serum absorbs better.
* You can multitask without fear.

Honestly, IMO, once you try it, going back to “bare” sheet masks feels like listening to music on old wired headphones after trying wireless. Technically it works, but why would you?

---

## Who Is This Best For?

I’d say… basically anyone who loves skincare but hates the hassle. Especially if:

* You use sheet masks often.
* You’re tired of wasting expensive serums.
* You multitask while masking.
* You’re into eco-friendly, reusable beauty tools.

Even beginners can use it—no fancy setup required.

---

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Silimask

* **Warm It Up:** Run it under warm water before applying—it feels spa-like.
* **Chill It Down:** Pop it in the fridge for 5 minutes if you want a cooling effect.
* **Pair It With Eye Patches:** Yes, it works with those too.
* **Double Duty:** Use it without a sheet mask just to help lock in moisturizer or serums.

Pro tip: Don’t store it in a messy drawer where it’ll collect dust. Keep it clean and dry between uses.

---

## Any Downsides?

Let’s be real—no product is perfect.

* It can look a little creepy. Don’t answer the door while wearing it unless you want to traumatize the delivery guy.
* If your face is very small, it might feel slightly loose (though most people don’t have this issue).
* You have to remember to wash it after every use (but honestly, it’s quick).

For me, those are minor trade-offs compared to the benefits.

---

## Is It Worth the Money?

Short answer: **yes.**

You’ll probably spend more on two lattes than on this mask holder. And since it’s reusable, it saves money in the long run. Plus, your expensive sheet masks will actually *work better.* That’s like leveling up your skincare without spending extra cash.

## Final Thoughts

If you love sheet masks but hate the annoying slip-and-slide problem, the **Lindo Silimask** is a total lifesaver. It keeps your mask in place, boosts serum absorption, and makes masking way less of a chore. Honestly, it’s one of those small but mighty skincare tools that you don’t realize you need—until you try it.

Sure, you’ll look a little silly wearing it. But who cares? You’ll have glowing, hydrated skin, and that’s what really matters. IMO, it’s a solid 10/10.

So go ahead, treat yourself (and maybe freak out your roommate in the process). Your skin will thank you.

A lot of the teams would do this and it was mostly harmless but also was supposed to ""shame"" you into remembering to lock your computer before you walk away, without reporting you to security for your formal reprimand (retraining -> write-ups -> disciplinary action -> job hunt). Everyone knew it was good-natured and when the messages went out everyone had a good laugh.

One day a new guy shows up and he leaves his computer unattended. I introduce myself, shake his hand, chat him up a bit and finally tell him he needs to lock his computer when he walks away, it's company policy, he probably ignored that in the training but it's a big deal. Sent him the documentation, because he thinks it's stupid (again, we're in the *security* umbrella). He says ""whatever"". I shrug walk away, and he and walks away making a show of not locking his computer. 

He got multiple warnings over his first few weeks from his team and other, but was a complete butt about it. After a while the team decides he's had enough warnings (and started being granted access to sensitive stuff) and so he was fair game.

Not long after I walked by him on his way to the elevator atrium, so I know he's going to be gone for a while. I sit down, find his email client and type out a silly message to his team's DL and hit send. As I'm standing up he's walking back. He finds me and demands to know what I was doing. I shrug, say ""whatever"" and walk away. Later that day his manager walks up and tells me that he explained the situation to his new employee, and that the new guy ""didn't want to play that game"" and was considering reporting me to security for impersonating him.

Really? Okay. No problem, Mr Manager (we were on very good terms), we will not play ""the game"" with your newbie. I will follow standard procedures. 

I got my team and a few others on chat to tell them that under no circumstances should anybody fire a message from him when they saw his computer unlocked. No ""shame"" reminders for newbie. Just follow the standard procedure.

Almost 50 security violation tickets were logged in the next two days. \[his desk happened to be closer to the elevator atrium, break room, and bathrooms so a lot of normal traffic\] He was in security retraining the following Monday. We were in an open floor plan and I could see how mad he was talking to his manager and gesturing in my direction quite a bit. Not my fault, I had only opened two tickets. 

His manager asked me to let up. Sorry, just following standard procedure, if I don't report these violations I'm liable.

Dude's computer was locked for the rest of that Monday only.  The following day as I walked by, there was his email, for all eyes to see and newbie nowhere to be found... He happened to be getting coffee, which was my destination as well, and I told I noticed he forgot to lock his computer. He cussed me out and speed-walked back. 

The damage was done. He'd already had a dozen tickets opened by others. And the security policy had changed at some point. Now it was a quick retraining then straight to disciplinary action (no write-up). He had to attend a meeting with his boss, director, and some security folks (I would find out much later that he got put on a security related PIP). He was gone in a week. 

No one was out to ruin anyone's career here, but if you want to work in security and flagrantly violate policy because... I don't know why, well, you don't belong there. ",99,1756417207.0,MaliciousCompliance,7,0.98,False

Upon recognizing this, I immediately became curious about where he was from. Without hesitation, I walked up to him and asked him. He stared at me for a few seconds and didn’t say anything. Then he responded South Africa. I never thought anything of it. The next day I passed by him in the hall and he waves. I panicked because I was surprised he remembered me and then well I got shy and ignored him. I am very shy. Then one evening I was a reading a book in the campus coffee shop. He sits down beside me and we start chatting, and well let’s just say that I fell in love?. He got up and left after about an hour or so and when I went to my dorm, I felt the most butterflies I had ever felt in my life. And I completely freaked out and was terrified. What was I feeling and why was I feeling this way. From that moment on I pretended to play it cool, like I didn’t really feel anything, I kinda observed that he was a bit of a ladies man but I couldn’t be certain.

He went home for the summer and so did I. I was hoping he would text me but he never did. Flash forward to the next year, I took a gap year and ran into him and I remember him saying you didn’t say by and once again I played it off like I wasn’t interested or didn’t care. I returned after my gap year and towards the end of the year decided that this next year I would work up the courage to get to know him to see if there was actually something there. Well he switched schools and I haven’t seen him since. I used to say that if he was actually interested he would have made a move but my mind just wants to know if what I felt was real.

1n2ov1i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2ov1i,Need help deciding on Quartz design for kitchen remodel,"
Hi everyone,

My wife and I are in the process of redoing our kitchen before moving into our new home. We’ve always liked the idea of a clean, white kitchen—something simple, classic, and not too bold. But now that we’re deep in the design phase, we’re realizing how many decisions there are and how quickly things can get complicated!

We’re trying to keep things minimal and budget-conscious, especially since we plan to live here for a few years and eventually rent the place out. Here’s what we’re thinking so far, and we’d really appreciate any feedback: attached is a chathpt rendering.

Lighting:
We’ve just had recessed lights installed and plan to add under-cabinet lighting to brighten up the space and create a clean look.

Cabinets:
We’re updating the hardware and painting the cabinets in Swiss Coffee. We're considering going two-tone with a darker color for the lower cabinets to add a bit of contrast and avoid the kitchen looking too white.

Floors:
Luxury vinyl planks in either a dark or tan wood tone. We’re leaning toward darker flooring to ground the space a bit.

Countertops:
We're replacing the tile with quartz. We’ve looked at several options with veining, but most of them felt too artificial or forced. We’re now leaning toward pure white quartz—it feels safer, cleaner, and it’s more affordable, especially since we’re using prefab. One concern is that veining across prefab pieces might not match up well, so plain white might be the best way to avoid awkward seams. Would love your thoughts on that!

Backsplash:
Subway tiles—likely white, but we might consider a soft accent color depending on how the cabinets turn out.

Appliances:
All stainless steel with black accents. Getting an over range microwave in place of the old hood. 

We’re both pretty simple people and don’t have a strong background in interior design. We’re trying to make thoughtful, timeless choices without overspending. If you have any suggestions, opinions (especially on the countertops or color balance), or just ideas on how to avoid making it too white, we’d really appreciate your insight!

""Highway A44"", Ouroboros, Eastern Antares

It's been days since they've marched out. So far, the uprising has been successful, and the Ouroboreans controlled seven areas in their oppressed homeland. Six if you count the one island that the Orionites helped them liberate. But still, the war wasn't over just yet. There is much to be done. For the men of ""Gruppa Lewandowski"", the ""much to be done"" part gives them an incentive to keep marching, in hopes of one day liberating their homeland. Most of the 50 men and some women in the Gruppa experienced the brutality of the Antareans during the November Revolts in 1929, when the Ouroboreans finally decided to do something. Sure, most were young and partially inexperienced, but they were hardy, patriotic, and loyal to the cause. In this case, those're the only things that truly matter.

At the beginning of November, Ouroborean forces managed to liberate a substantial amount of land, including the Northwest end of Highway A44, the road that the troops were marching down now. Thanks to Orionite support, they had provisions and food for the next three weeks, just enough for the trip to their objective and back. In addition to this, they were carrying six oblong crates, each one containing a powerful explosive charge meant to penetrate armored objects. At the head of the group, the commanding officer, Felix ""Franek"" Lewandowski, was contemplating the horizon with a curious gaze. The countryside of Ouroboros seemed beautiful, almost ethereal in this time of year. The rolling green hills, farms and various hills rising in the distance. Yet, it was the only peaceful area of the nation, untouched by war, as if it was another planet entirely.

Before joining the cause, he was in the Antarean Army. They've been conscripting a lot of Ouroboreans to do combat duties that were much more dangerous than the ones done by the Antareans themselves. Flametroopers, scouts, etc. The one with the most casualties compared to the others, though, were assault medics. They were medics that were sent into charges with the army to perform quick medical tasks while under fire. 76% casualty rate, and Felix was lucky enough to survive as one, albeit with a fusillade of scars and burns from suicidal charges, which at first were forced, and later on he went willingly, as he had no other choice, and his men needed a morale booster in any way.

Enough of wallowing in the past, though, as they were drawing near to their objective. For months the Home Army had planned this operation, and for months they had practiced with dummy charges in Orion. The first idea had been to take a human torpedo with detachable charges and sail away, but they'd have been noticed on the approach, since those need to be carried by a mothership. The second one, which they were doing right now, was to take six charges in partially floating cases in order to not sink to the bottom, and attach two to Ramyana Gora's dry dock doors, the only ones capable of repairing and maintaining the leviathan AIS *Tau.* The second part of their objective would be to mount one charge to the AIS *Kormoran*, one to the AIS *Kurassier*, one to AIS *Tamerlan*, and one to AIS *Seligman*. Two battleships, one battlecruiser, and one *contre-torpilleur*, a new destroyer class that the Antareans kept like a prize dog, not letting it go on long range patrols, for which the class was meant.

Two days later, they arrived on the coast under cover of darkness. After climbing a hill and arriving at a promontory overlooking the base, they began preparations. First, the explosive charges were put into fiberglass containers with two ropes for dragging them through water. While the men and women worked to place the charges for travel, preparing their equipment, and praying before the mission, Felix and his adjutant, Sergeant Major Koulikov, were scanning the coast and the naval base for the mission ahead. After his line of sight passed over the *Kurassier*, the last ship in the row, he suddenly spotted the silhouette of another ship right next to it. It was smaller, but much wider, compared to the battleship it was tied next to. He put the binoculars down, a confused frown on his face. It was odd, as the double agent working for them said that new ships weren't due to put in for the next month and a half.

Reaching for his pack, opened a notebook, and flipped through it, until finally he found what he was looking for. It was a Mogador-class ""depot ship"", a vessel that was laden with fuel, provisions for ships like food, water, and medical supplies. To add to the already numerous stocks of non-combatant cargo, it was also laden with explosives, munitions, and torpedoes. In a sense, it was a massive floating powder keg. The problem with these though, was that they were a relatively new class, and only two were made so far, with one still in a dry dock on the West Coast, the AIS *Neptun*, and its sister ship, the AIS *Volta* was here in port. Upon closer examination of the waterline, it became evident that the ship was heavy with cargo.

Turning to his adjutant, he pointed out the ship. ""See that one right there? It's a depot ship. If we blow up the *Kurassier* successfully, the fumes from the fuel line attached to it will rip it apart."" Koulikov processed this information, and his face grew into a devious grin. ""So two birds with one stone?"" Felix nodded, while pulling the straps on his frogman gear tighter. ""Yes. They won't have the ability to replenish ships at sea anymore, at least on this coast."" Ten minutes later, they were all ready. Stepping forward, he stopped in front of Sergeant Kociniak, handing her a picture. ""This is your objective, the AIS *Seligman*. Study it well, because you won't be allowed to resurface to identify it from the outside. Identify it by it's hull."" He walked down the line, and again, gave a picture of the AIS *Kormoran* to Sergeant Foch. ""Your objective is well-armored, so place the charge near it's munitions stowage. Same as before, do not surface unless it's an emergency and your life is in danger.""

For himself, he kept a picture of the AIS *Kurassier*, and to Koulikov, he gave the picture of the *Tamerlan*. With that, he turned to everyone else, and rendered a two-finger salute. ""My fellow partisans, I commend you. Most men and women wouldn't dare to come on this mission. You were chosen because you have guts, you are patriotic, and you've got the strongest spirit of resistance that I've ever seen. Our mission is to blow up four ships and a drydock. Some of you will be attaching the charges, some wont, and some of you will be assisting with securing two E-Boats for escape. Some of us may not come back from this mission, but that's a chance you and I are willing to take. ***Ouroboros jeszcze nie zginął, niech żyje Ouroboros!""***

After the speech, the partisans descended the promontory and into the water. The groups assigned to attaching the charges splashed down, and pulled the charge containers along, submerging and activating the Scuba gear on their back, taking deep breaths through the ""Gagnan device"" attached to the canisters by a long tube. A few minutes after crossing into the perimeter of the base, they split off towards their respective targets. The particular choice of attacking today was partly due to today being a national holiday in Antares, and some of the base personnel would either be in the mess hall, or out and about in the town nearby. This made it easy, as they would take minimal casualties, while inflicting heavy damage and substanial destruction of materiel themselves.

As Felix swam along with the charge strapped to his back, the tube suddenly seized up. Silently cursing to himself, he knew that he had to take the risk of surfacing to clear it, or else he would suffocate and the *Kurassier* and the ship next to it would remain untouched. He was near a ship, the moonlight shining down into the water. Taking a moment to pray, he surfaced, and quietly spat the breathing device out. He slowly put the goggles up, and started to clear the tube. Suddenly, he heard a quiet and surprised gasp. Looking up slowly, he saw the source of the sound. It was an Antarean sailor, a woman, with the shoulder chevrons designating her as a Leutnant (Lieutenant). Her green eyes widened, realizing that he was a potential threat. Slowly, to appear casual, he raised a hand in greeting, and in perfect Antarean, said ***""Guten Abend, Leutnant.""*** Then, with a flurry of motion, the Lieutenant disappeared. By then, he cleared the tube, and put it back in his mouth, put the goggles back on, and went under again, swimming to his target.

**Meanwhile, aboard the AIS** ***Royalle,*** **a Rochelle-class cruiser**

The night has been long and the 12 hours of no sleep was starting to get to Maya. After recently being promoted from *Unterleutnant* to *Leutnant*, her schedule was full of a fusillade of paperwork, picking up a new uniform since rank insignias are now sewn on, and doing various administrative tasks. For now, she was taking a much-needed break, her chin propped up on her hand as she stared out into the darkness from the deck of the *Royalle*. She was just starting to doze off, when she heard a splash. It was not in front of her, but below her, so she looked over the railing, and spotted a man fiddling with a breathing tube, wearing what looked to resemble a wetsuit and scuba gear. She gasped, and he stopped. He looked up, frozen for a moment, and with a smile he raised a hand, waved, and in her native language, responded with ***""Guten Abend, Leutnant.""***

She had to tell someone. So, after rushing away from the deck, she ran to the bridge, and turned a corner, opening the door to Arden's stateroom. He was busy, working on something so interesting that he didn't see her enter. ""Arden, there's a man in the water. He looked up at me and said hello. He looks like he means trouble, though. Should we raise an alarm?"" Arden stopped, looked up at her with raised eyebrows, and sighed. ""Look, Maya, you've been awake for what, more than 12 hours? The fatigue is playing tricks on you. No one's crazy enough to sabotage our ships in the middle of the night in a heavily defended harbor, let alone dive deep into freezing water. It's nearly December, for crying out loud."" Looking back down towards his work, then he looked back up, sighing again. ""Alright, fine. I'll go look.""

He followed Maya out and leaned over the edge. His eyes scanned the water and spotted nothing out of the ordinary. The surface was still, almost smooth, if not for the strong wind coming in from the North. ""See? There's nothing to worry about. You're just imagining things."" Maya stammered, trying to piece together what just happened. ""B-but, I-I... he was just there!"" Arden chuckled, and turned around, his steps receding as he walked away. ""I'll make some coffee, if you intend to stay awake."" Maya nodded, and turned around, looking out into the harbor. She sat down at a bench next to the railing, and kept watch, almost as if she was glued to the bench.

***Meanwhile...***  
***35 feet below the water***

So far, Felix had made good progress. The charge was comfortably bumping against his leg as he neared the *Kurassier*. He swam alongside it, almost touching the hull. Then, the work began. Reaching down to extract the charge from the case, he made sure the case itself was flooded so it would sink instead of floating. Grabbing the oblong charge with both hands, he placed it onto the hull, right above the area where the munitions storage would be. He then reached into his pocket, and pulled out two timed detonation ""blasting caps"". If the timing was correct, he had 12 minutes to get the hell out of there and to the rendezvous point with the other partisans. One cap, two caps, three caps, and it was set. Giving it a gentle pat for his own luck, he swam away, the red flashing light pulsating in his line of sight, but out of view of the men and women on board the ships.

About seven minutes later, he surfaced on the other side of the harbor. He shook the water off, spat the tube out, and flipped off the flipper attachments to his boots. All that was left was his boots, the wetsuit, and an OSM-33(S) submachine gun on a strap wrapped around the front of his body. He unwrapped it, and reached for a pouch on his utility belt, taking out the long suppressor, and screwing it onto the barrel's end. Next, he unfolded the wire stock, and popped in a fresh magazine of 7.62x25, cocking the charging handle back, and kicking the diving gear into the water to dispose of the evidence. He then got out of cover, and walked in a combat stance towards the administrative building.

Off to his left, he saw movement. Taking a short breath, he turned, and whisper-yelled into the darkness. ""Halt! Identify yourself."" The movement stopped, and out of the darkness, a voice answered ""It's Sergeant Slivko, Corporal Whitmann, Private Rochefort, and Private Muratov."" He sighed a breath of relief, and the four men appeared, their OSMs also raised. ""Where are the rest?"" He asked, slowly nearing the building, not taking a moment to look towards the others for a response. ""They're near the E-Boat docks, sir. We're making good progress so far."" Felix nodded, satisfied that everything was going according to plan so far. ""If the timing is correct, we have about three more minutes before the charges blow five ships and a dry dock to kingdom come. So, I suggest we finish up with the scum in this building. Check the main office, there's E-Boat keys. We need two. They'll probably have numbered tags on them.""

The men nodded, and as they were making their way over, he caught the elbow of Corporal Whitmann, motioning with his fingers towards a room that had it's lights on. In there, voices that were slurred by alcohol-induced delirium. He slowly inched towards the door, nudging it open with the tip of his OSM's barrel. An officer was busy telling a joke to his subordinates, their roaring laughter drowning out the two men that were now standing in the room. ""...And so I said, 'That is not my wife, that is my dog!' and he immediately froze up!"" The laughter continued, and when the laughter died down, they froze and turned, because the uproar continued in the form of Felix's mocking laughter. ""HAHAHAHA...ha, ha."" His face suddenly turned serious. ""Very funny."" He squeezed the trigger, round after round peppering the Antareans, and after that was out of the way, he kicked the Antarean officer's body over, and retrieved his pistol, and his sword. On his way out, one of the Antareans was struggling to get up, so without looking, he popped the man twice, the suppressor's nearly silent report seemingly unheard, which was good for them.

Out in the hall, he met the others, and looking down at his watch, he smiled. Thirty seconds. ""Gentlemen, I promised a celebration for the anniversary of this unit, and I deliver. I present to you, the Ouroborean Orchestra!"" As he kicked the door open, one of two things happened. First, the gates on the drydock were demolished, the heat melting the opening mechanism in the locked position, and in the process completely demolishing the gate itself. Soon after, the *Kormoran* went up in flames. Next, the *Tamerlan* and the *Seligman* blew up, the magnificent fireball and the shockwave forced the *Tamerlan* to roll over, while the *Seligman* broke up into two pieces. And finally, the main course. The *Kurassier* was rocked with a series of three explosions that started from the bow, until the fumes from the *Volta's* fuel line attached to the bigger ship were ignited. The flames traveled down the tube and into the fuel storage. They ignited the rest of the fuel, and the explosion rocked the ship, taking out the munitions and gunpowder storage with a massive shockwave that the men felt from here, and the windows broke. Whoops of laughter, joy, and sheer elation that they have succeeded erupted from the men watching. The flames from the destroyed ships burned brighter, and so did the flames of the spirit of the nation's strive for independence, like a phoenix rising above the ashes, ready to wreak havoc like never before.

After descending the small ridgeline on which the administrative building sat, he and the men walked to the docks, the keys to E-Boats numbered ""38"" and ""44"" dangling from Felix's finger. After confirming that the men at the dock were indeed Ouroborean, he motioned for them to follow, stepping over the dead bodies that littered the docks. Up above, he heard a trench whistle, the sound of which he came to both loathe and enjoy at the same time. He spotted Antareans descending the hill, guns raised. So after boarding the E-Boats, they quickly started to move away, but not quick enough for their liking, as the Antareans were already beginning to reach the entrance to the dock. Felix took the initiative, grabbing the grip of a 13mm MG131 machine gun mounted on the rear. Pulling the charging handle back, he opened fire, the rounds practically chewing through the advancing Antareans, most of whom were trying to shoot back, only to be silenced by the gun.

Whomever was left, however, were retreating. Some dropped their guns, some were carrying their wounded comrades away, so he took his hands off of the machinegun, the E-Boats speeding up, eventually leaving the confines of the harbor, speeding away for Neumann Island, their only non-contiguous territory. As he sat at one of the benches at the stern of the boat, he couldn't help but smile. So many trials and error, so many casualties, more than six years of fighting, and here they were, finally showing the Antareans that there are consequences to their actions. He thought about the people who came and went, the ones who lived and who didn't. His brother, his mentor, amongst many other people. It calmed him, knowing that their sacrifices weren't in vain, and that they no longer will.

With that being said, I wanted to share a bit of my journey with you all, as it’s been quite an evolution for me…a journey that both wracks my nerves as well as burns the little flame inside of me brighter and brighter.

Growing up, I wasn’t exactly the little girl that every mother dreamed of, the one who puts on the living room performances of cheetah girls to convince her parents to let her have a sleepover at her cousin's house, or the little girl who is excited to get her nails done and talk about boy problems. I was a pretty standard kid, I think. I loved catching grasshoppers with my bare hands, wearing bowls on my head as a form of protection, before riding my bike down a steep hill and getting into fights with my brothers. I also came up with insane imagination games to keep myself busy, all while simultaneously avoiding my homework.

I like to call that era of my tour (the tour of life) the golden era. Because that was the time when, despite not fitting in always, I was always having a damn good time with my friends and family…the lack of questioning anything about my gender or sexuality was certainly a perk too. That was until about 5th grade, of course. I was a new kid in school and just trying to make my way into the world, all while over-correcting my eye contact with people and trying my best to make new friends. (My parents found out I was autistic a year before, and I had just become aware of it myself and was practicing my social skills a bunch).

While I could get into the trauma of being the disappointing first child that just so happened to be born a girl and broke my dads heart, my mom settling for the fact she was raising a ‘tomboy’,  or how a bunch of kids at my new school approached me and asked if I was a lesbian because I kept making eye contact with a girl that sat across from me in our assigned seats at lunch and answering yes despite not knowing what a lesbian even was at the time because I was heavily religious.

 I think the best thing of note during my fifth grade year was the dream I had about a girl named Maria (name changed for obvious reasons), she wasn’t the girl that sat across from me at lunch, but she was the tallest in my gym class, had long brown hair and was the first person I had ever met with braces, and boy was I hooked after having a dream about the music video to the song “Baby” by Justin Bieber, but instead of the Beibs, it was her serenading me in this kooky little dream I had. This dream, was so much different than the feelings of irritation I had for a boy named Jack (name changed for obvious reasons) in my classroom who would sing Leona Lewis’s “Bleeding Love” incorrectly, and my friends and parents all insisted I had a crush on this boy because of how upset he made me. No, no, I was certain that after that dream, I was most certainly into girls.

Fast forwarding into the years and several different moves and school changes later, I don’t think about crushes for a little while, and I especially found that I didn’t fit into the “feminine” box. Not by my own choice at first; normally, when you’re an overweight little girl, the world tends to look at you in a way that’s no longer feminine, but that of an animal or something. I had found myself in the center of a “girl gang,” - which was not much of a surprise to anyone in particular. Growing up, I seldom had friends who were boys, mainly because I wasn’t allowed to, and for the most part, I didn’t really mind it all that much. But in the girl gang? Everything was great, we would do sleepovers, weekend trips downstate, and of course, we all had to pick a guy from One Direction to obsess over. I let my friends pick their favorites first, it worked out super well with there being five of us, so when Liam Payne (rip) was left over, I knew EXACTLY who to pick. During sleepovers, I would cut this man's face out of everything because my friends and I would of course, get magazines of them and we would put them all over our bedrooms and lockers.

(side note, shoutout to Little Mix, you were the driving force of me questioning my sexuality) 

The boy named Justin (name changed for obvious reasons), who had a locker next to mine, would often peer into my locker to see that Liam Payne’s face was plastered it. He told me that he thought he looked like him, and I went along with it (he didn’t) - so much so that when he asked me to a dance, I said sure. Because obviously, we would get to listen to one direction with my girl gang in tow. Imagine my surprise when all of my friends had dates that they were kissing and Justin thought that he might get the same treatment. That dance I ended up running to and hiding in the bathroom for a while, having anxiety cramps in my stomach and contemplating what to do before my friends came looking for me, and it convinced me that it was rude to bail on Justin.

That night, I had my first kiss near the bus garage with all of my friends watching. I remembered thinking that his lips were oddly shaped and that I should count to a decent number like ten before pulling away, so I didn’t come off as rude.

That year, I remember learning from my dad that being gay was one of the biggest sins that a person could ever commit after he chased a trans neighbor down the road because she was wearing a skirt, because my brothers and I all saw her singing as she walked down the sidewalk.

That moment with my first kiss, I told myself that I could like boys…I just needed to try harder. Turns out it’s really easy to get along with them better if you treat them how you treat your brothers at that age, make conversations easy, make getting into the emo scene easy, hell, since I wasn’t allowed to hang out with them to begin with, it really simplified my pre-teen to early teen dating life. I could deal with being the girl who had crummy parents that wouldn’t let her go out if that meant I didn’t have to lose my virginity to a random guy off of the school's nature trail and get pregnant from it. (Real story happened to a friend)

Thankfully, my parents ended up divorcing around that time, and I got to stick with my mom for a lot of the time. She was the easy-going free spirit who had finally gotten out of a bad marriage with a man who is likely very aromantic (yeah, I’ll say he is, his views align). Around that time, gender became a really odd concept. I noticed that I was slimming down, and people would treat me more like a “girl”. That freaked me out. I disliked how I was treated by people my age and much, much older…

I started finding comfort in baggy clothes, hiding all of my hair up in my beanies, and even following makeup tutorials from ‘Emo Boys”, because in that era? I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be Andy Sixx or be with him (spoiler alert, I just thought he had cool hair). I was fine with not being all that girly, I was fine with only hanging with my girl friends. I was feeling better than I had for a while, happier too. Though there were always the looming thoughts about who I was and what I liked, and hearing it from my old man during every other weekend, maybe wasn’t the best for me.

Though my mom ends up re-marrying. We all ended up moving to the first nice area that I had ever lived in. Imagine suburbia with exactly all that you need surrounding it in a walkable distance. I was going to be going to a new school, a very cool and liberal school, and my family was out of the church that had my mom under their thumb for years, now only opting to do so when bored or if it was to avoid my dad.

That is when I discovered the greatest thing of all. My high school? It was like watching an episode of freaking Glee. I started on the true first day versus mid-year so I was the new kid walking around, freshly washed away my emo persona, and decided to do something new. This high school went hard when it came to the following: Choir and additional singing groups, lacrosse, and theater. I was in heaven. Everyone was so nice here and welcoming, and frankly, the teachers were so accommodating to new students who had to catch up on the curriculum. Over time, I end up joining the GSA - of course, for ally reasons….no other reasons….(a lie if you will). I start getting out there, doing sports and extracurriculars, and finally things are going well, so well that my small group of friends were the first people I ever came out to. I had chosen to go with bisexual, because of compulsive heterosexuality, but I more or less had said it was because I kissed boys before, but I also want to kiss girls…being 16 in 2013 was a different time, man. The reason I came out? Well, that's because I had fallen head over heels for my girlfriend Layla (name changed for obvious reasons), who lived a state away, whom I had met on Tumblr. It was becoming harder to explain to my friends why I couldn’t hang out on the weekends, and that was because she and I met up several times and we began long-distance dating, and for the first time ever…I felt wanted, I felt like I had a good handle on who I was, and most importantly, it was my first time ever truly feeling like I was into the person I was dating.

Harsh to hear, I’m sure, but I ended up dating a few very safe people at this high school. A boy on the soccer team who was really in tune with his emotions, a nonbinary student who was in the theater club that I would go to support. But Layla was the first girl I ever admitted I had feelings for, and each and every day, she found a new way to blow me out of the water, change my perspective, and fall harder.

That being said, I broke up with her when I was eighteen and she was seventeen. I didn’t want to get in trouble, especially since being gay in most places where I’m from was still kinda…not great. She and I ended things on agreeable terms, and we went our separate ways, and I began dating another girl from my school a few months later, before graduating. The following New Year's Eve after graduating, I came out to my mom at midnight. We all counted down, excited to welcome the new year, and instead of doing the normal thing where you make a New Year's wish (family tradition) I told her I’m bisexual, but still felt like I was shoving something down…deep down.

A few years later, mixed with college experiences, getting my driver's license, going to college, and of course, a few relationships later, 2020 hit. And so did the pandemic.

Those few months before the lockdown, I had been doing extensive therapy and had concluded that I might be a lesbian. However, I was unsure because I had just ended a very traumatic relationship that included things such as DV, SA, SH, and all of it left me scared of men…that was the toughest time of my life, and I am lucky to say that I’m still here and still alive. But that mixed with my attention-seeking behaviors from men certainly didn't help.

(Shout out to my therapist for helping me realize I did that because I did not have a good male role model and instead had a bad dad!!! woooooo!!!! I sought out abuse subconsciously because my dad left a big hole in my heartttttttt....love that for me)

*Anyways.*

That year, I got close with my adult friends; we would do everything together, and I had never felt safer, knowing that I was looking out for them and they were looking out for me. Not to mention, that was my first group of all gay friends!!!!! I was literally over the moon in my queer community. But back to the sexuality and gender portion…I wanted to see if I was really feeling the way I was, and the only way I knew how was to test that theory with someone I trusted my life with. Literally. This guy would take a bullet for me to this day.

I had slept with my friend. I picked him because he’s rather handsome, a sweetheart, knows my family really well, and because I knew that it wouldn’t be weird between us even if it was for a little bit. So I slept with him and…I felt nothing. 

*Oh god, did I feel nothing.* 

Of course, I FELT the sex, bestie is well endowed, but I didn’t feel anything about the sex, even if he met other impossible criteria that I had established as needing. Again, I could tell he was laying it down, and I was putting in the work too, but in the end it felt cold, and weird, and I knew I was supposed to be having a good time, but I hadn’t been.

We reassured each other that there were no hard feelings, his partner came in to be a pillar for him (they’re super poly), I ended up getting a mcgriddle and an ice coffee down the road, turned up the Death of a Bachelor album to the max and screamed and screamed and screamed until my voice was hoarse in my little honda civic, before telling myself that I was in fact. A lesbian. A lesbian that felt weird about being a lesbian because I didn’t feel like a freaking girl. But hot damn, did I know.

Anyways...maybe I'll post a part two if my heart is in it sometime soon. If you read all of this yapping? Thanks, I love u <3",2,1756416254.0,comingout,0,1.0,False
1n2oqdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1n2oqdx/a_theory_on_why_we_all_develop_unique/,A theory on why we all develop unique sensitivities (and what I've tried to do about it),"Hi all, it’s been a few years since I posted but I’ve experienced a minor flare recently so I figured I’d pop back in to get some perspective. T**his is not my 4 year recovery story, but I’ll be writing that and posting it here soon.** I tried to keep it as concise as possible for anyone willing to spend the time and read my thoughts. Thanks for reading - here goes!

Among floxies there are certain triggers that are relatively consistent. Substances that are contraindicated with FQs, like corticosteroids and NSAIDs seem to reliably trigger most floxies. However, I always wondered why other substances are so inconsistent. Many of us are/were triggered by caffeine, cannabis, or alcohol, but it seems just as many were not.

In my early flox days, I was extremely reactive to caffeine and cannabis (I didn’t even try alcohol for the first few months, and over 4 years later have still never taken an NSAID). I also felt that substances that interact with GABA receptors were a trigger for me, as I tried Valerian root for sleep early on and it made me feel very off and did not help with my sleep. About 2 weeks into my acute phase, I had green tea in an attempt to try a low-dose of caffeine. It flared me severely, and my symptoms took about 2 weeks to return to baseline. I had a similar reaction trying cannabis a few weeks later, and decided to stop playing with fire for the time being. My most severe symptoms were always neurological symptoms, and the anxiety, neuropathy, eye issues, and brain-tingling were a harsher deterrent than my tendon or muscle pain.

I didn’t try caffeine for another 3 months, but eventually decided to have a latte the morning after a friend’s wedding (I also had alcohol at the wedding, which didn’t flare me at all). The coffee didn’t flare me, though I did feel a slight whisper of nerve and tendon pain, but I was happy with the results. In a few more months (6 months post-flox), I began to reintegrate coffee and black tea into my daily routine and did not experience any problems or flares.

On a whim last week (4 years post-flox!), I tried matcha from my local coffee shop and really enjoyed it. I had cautiously tried normal green and white tea within the last year, and did not experience any negative symptoms. I loved a natural higher ratio of caffeine to L-theanine in matcha  - I was more focused and less jittery at work that day than with coffee or black tea, and extra antioxidants couldn’t hurt right? I abruptly replaced my daily black teas with matcha. After 5 days, I began to feel strange. I was noticing an increase in what I perceived as a mild neurological flare, itchy skin, tingling nerves, strange inconsistencies in my vision (blurs, floaters), mental fatigue, and the uncomfortable tingling in my brain that was a little too familiar.

**I remembered Dr. H saying that our bodies may “remember the hurt”** and it got me thinking perhaps trying green tea so early on in my floxing caused my body to associate green tea with the destruction the FQs caused, and now I react to it.  I was smoking cannabis and drinking green tea pretty regularly leading up to getting floxed, including the first 2 days that symptoms started to set in (in my acute phase, it took about 3 days for the “bomb” to really go off).

I always bounced back from flares and had less of a flare if I tried again, so my belief is that a flare and subsequent recovery will actually leave you better off than you were before. I flared numerous times early on when I tried to exercise, even just walking a mile or 2, and every chemical sensitivity has flared less as I tried again. My tentative theory is that a flare is exposing these damaged cells to your immune system, which gets rid of them and thus, the flare is less severe the next time.

**Do any of you feel that the substances you are/were triggered by were in your system at the time of floxing? Were they things you regularly consumed leading up to or during your acute phase? If you care to know the specifics of green tea and how I beat back my cannabis sensitivity, keep reading. If not, I’d love to hear your thoughts and what you personally are sensitive to and if it has improved over time with or without repeated exposure.**

**Specifics of Green Tea (EGCG and apoptosis)**

I drink black tea regularly, so I know I’m not allergic or sensitive to tea leaves in general. I also drank decaf black tea all the time when I first got floxed. I’ve ruled out L-theanine and caffeine as triggers, and in learning about green tea I am pretty sure it is the concentration of catechins in green tea - including EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate) which is an antioxidant that encourages cell apoptosis, the controlled elimination of damaged or infected cells. Matcha has up to 5x more EGCG normal green tea, and up to 15x more than black tea. During the fermentation process that produces black tea, many of these catechins break down in the fermentation process that produces black tea and convert into theaflavins, thearubigins, and theabrownins, the antioxidants that give black tea its color. I wonder if this apoptosis is destroying cells that were damaged by FQs, much in the same way that exercise, which encourages mitophagy, also triggered me post-acute phase.

So this recent mini-flare seems to be a flox sensitivity to something unique to green tea, perhaps coupled with a mild allergy I developed during the acute phase. It’s hard to de-couple neurological itching from allergy itching, though I did take a strong dose of antihistamine OTC allergy meds and it did not alleviate my symptoms whatsoever, and I find the tingling in the back of my brain to be unique to neurological triggers. I took antioxidants last night and got \~7 hours of sleep and I’d say I feel about 90% normal today. Not a big flare by any means, and it only happened after multiple days of matcha, but very much a noticeable occurrence.

Based on my experience with cannabis detailed below, I plan on trying matcha once every week or so to see how I react and if the reactions don’t become less severe or disappear over time. I’d be slamming a matcha every morning if I could, so I’m willing to try to make it work like I (stupidly) did with weed.

**THC and Repeated Exposure**

I had similar reactions to cannabis, but I basically brute-forced my sensitivity to death. I thought about it like exposure therapy, and I was willing to try despite the discomfort because it helps me with my creative endeavors and I don't really drink alcohol. After about 18 months post-flox, I began infrequently using small amounts of cannabis again, which did bring on mild neurological symptoms and tendon tightening, but nothing some antioxidants, magnesium, and a good night’s sleep didn’t mostly fix. When I first started smoking again, it would take 3-5 days for symptoms to disappear so I would go weeks or months without testing again.

I discovered over time that I barely had any reaction to CBD or terpenes (tested separately), and my actual trigger from cannabis was THC. By the time I was living in California 2.5 years post-flox, I could use cannabis socially with some regularity and not have it impact my quality of life, though I admit my nerves/motor control did feel slightly off while under the effects.

At this point over 4 years out, I can smoke and not feel any negative side effects, though I still don’t exercise after cannabis just in case there is some slight tightness I am not noticing. If I were to smoke heavily the way that I did in my youth, I would probably experience some lasting tightness until sleeping, though to what extent that is a flox symptom vs just being high and noticing my body more, I can’t say. I will say when I stretched regularly 2 years ago I did not notice this tightness, so it might just be that I need to stretch every day after sitting all day at work (duh!).

Back in December of last year I was prescribed azithromycin (500 mg daily) for an infection. Because I know it can irritate the stomach, I only took 250 mg to test my reaction. The first dose was fine, but after the second or third dose I developed a really sharp, localized pain in the center of my upper abdomen (just above the belly button). The pain didn’t spread anywhere else and I didn’t have other symptoms. It would come for like a minute and go away and then start again in a cycle. This would last anywhere between 1-4 hours. I also stopped the antibiotic because it caused me too much pain and I simply refused to take it (yes, I know you should make sure to complete your course of antibiotics). On top of that, I think I do remember taking quite a lot of advil due to my fever (but never exceeded maximum allowed dose per day). 

Since then, the same intense pain has been reoccurring once or twice every few months without a clear trigger. Most of the time I assumed it was gas pain.

It happened again about 2–3 weeks ago, and at that time I thought it might be due to an iron pill I had started. I stopped the iron pill, but the pain came back a week after even though I had not taken the pill again.

Whenever it happens, I take Buscopan (either 10mg or 20mg), Simethicone chewable tablet (40mg), and sometimes one Rennie chewable antacid.

Another type of pain, that I never acknowledged until I read some posts on here,  is left rib pain right under my breast.

Anyway, I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy today which showed mild gastritis (unclear cause yet, awaiting biopsy results). No signs of celiac disease, no signs of crohn’s disease (had to be ruled out due to positive calprotectin), no hiatal hernia, negative rapid urease test, no apthus ulcer, no colitis.

I’m a mom to a 7-week-old and I’ve been finding myself with a bit of extra pumped milk. I know a freezer stash is often glorified on social media, but I personally prefer to feed my baby fresh milk and don’t think a large stash will benefit us.

At the moment, I don’t have an extreme oversupply, just a steady amount that sometimes adds up to extra. I was thinking maybe I could donate a few bags each week to another mom in need here in St. Catharines.

A few details:
I clean my pump after every session. 
I store milk in the fridge first, and if unused within 3 days, I bag and freeze it. 
Don’t consume alcohol/don’t smoke. 
I do have a cup of coffee per day and occasionally eat dairy products. 
Right now I have about 10 bags ranging from 150 ml – 300 ml each. 
Supply amount may vary, but I’m open to figuring out an arrangement that works

If any local moms are interested, please feel free to message me!

Side note: I know some people say to build a big freezer stash early on, but I don’t think I need more than a small “backup” supply for my own baby. Do you think it’s reasonable to donate the extras at just 7 weeks postpartum? I’d love to hear what other moms have done and in the meantime, I’d be happy to help another family.

Thanks 💙

I want like a chibi style character with a white Simpson bandit with a black visor (I’ll post a picture of the helmet style) and a race suit that looked like his (I’ll also post a picture of that) and a halo over top of the helmet somewhat. Facing away where you see his back and have the number 39 on there. But he would be looking back where you can see part of the front of the helmet. And he’s walking towards a gate that says victory lane in the clouds. I just think this would look so sick if done right.

In my teens  I took a couple of jobs at fast food restaurants and coffee shops, but would like to do something different now. I also worked as a receptionist and office clerk for several years in college and hated being at a desk all day. 

I was considering becoming a waiter at a high-end restaurant in hopes that the tips might be good, but the horror stories are giving me doubts. For reference: I’m 23f and introverted to the point where I can come off as antisocial, but on a good day I can also be a ray of sunshine. 

Any tips or suggestions for specific roles that might not be completely miserable?

The Toll Booth to Everywhere

The alarm chirps rudely, waking me from the only thing I look forward to: sleep.

I get up slowly, as if the weight of my morning rituals might somehow delay the inevitable. My head sinks into my palms, elbows balanced on rickety knees. I sit there for a while, not thinking, not feeling—just stalled.

Finally, I let out a long, slow breath and begin another day. They’re all the same.

Wake up. Hate being awake. Stretch. Empty bowels. Dress. Eat. Get to work.



The drive out is long and hot, even before the sun’s up. No traffic, of course—just empty desert roads lined with dust, ghost signs, and the occasional stubborn cactus trying to look like it still believes in rain.



I pass the diner that never opens, the gas station that’s been boarded since Clinton, and the crooked sign that says “WEL OME” in a way that feels personal.



The booth shows up like a bad memory—squatting alone at the edge of everything. Concrete walls, metal roof, one cracked window. A monument to pointlessness.



I park in the shade it barely casts, unlock the door, and step inside. The air smells like warm vinyl and stale tobacco. Everything’s just as I left it: the stool with the wobble, the DNA Diviner with its soft red light and faded decals, the ledger with no end or beginning.



I sit. The chair creaks like it’s tired too. I clock in.



And I wait.



7:47 AM.  It won’t be long now.  Then I see it.



Like a mirage an old Pontiac slowly lurches forward, unsure if I too am a mirage in this booth.  The Pontiac comes to a halt.  The driver’s a woman, late thirties maybe. Sunglasses, lipstick, funeral-black dress. She rolls down the window and stares straight ahead. She doesn't speak.



I slide open the panel.

“Arm.”



She doesn’t argue. Just shifts in her seat as if rethinking every decision that led her here and slowly stretches out her arm through the window like it’s a toll ticket.



The Diviner hums. One drop of blood, and it begins.



The first screen lights up:

“Venice. March 13th, 2046. Midnight. Balcony.”



The second follows:

“Payment Due: Final memory of her face.”

She doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t even blink. Just nods once, slow and final.

I press the button. A rusty mechanical arm lifts from the ground beside the booth—like an old-fashioned toll gate. No lights. No fireworks. No celestial choir. Just that creaking steel arm rising in the dry wind.

She drives forward without hurry. Her car rolls past the booth and keeps going, engine purring softly. Then, as the road stretches ahead, the heat begins to shimmer. Her silhouette blurs, bends, softens like a mirage.

And just like that—she’s gone.

No tire marks. No sign. Just sunlight on asphalt, and the taste of dust in the air.

I lower the arm, log the toll, and take a drink of coffee that’s already gone cold.  I make a face.  I hate cold coffee.  

The hours between cars stretch like dried sinew—taut, cracking, empty.

Sometimes it’s three hours. Sometimes ten. I’ve gone whole days without seeing a single soul. Just the sound of the wind scraping sand across the asphalt. Just the booth. Just me.

There’s no radio. No internet. Management said signals interfere with the Diviner. I don’t know if that’s true, but I never tested it. I’ve stopped testing things. It’s easier to just sit and rot.

I read the same paperback mystery once a week. It’s missing the last five pages. I like that. I like not knowing how something ends.

I used to count the tumbleweeds. I’d name them, even. Then one day I realized I was doing it unironically, and I stopped. Felt too close to losing the thread.

Sometimes, I wonder if they space the arrivals out on purpose—like it’s part of the price. Not theirs. Mine.  I can’t even remember how I got here anymore.

Because in the end, it’s just waiting. For them to show up. For them to leave. For the dust to settle.

Some days I wonder if I’m still alive.
 Other days, I know I am.
 That’s worse.

I’ve been tempted over the…years? Months? There are no seasons here to tell…but over the length of time I have thought of escaping this purgatory and going…on.  Somewhere.  Anywhere.  Ideally where the coffee is hot.

Car.  Wait.  Car.  Wait.  New Amsterdam February 29 2188.  First memory  of snow.  Rome March 15, 44 BC.  37 drachmas.  Munich November 8, 1923.  All feelings of hate.  All dates people longed to be at and as they crossed the threshold their future, the past, lay before them.  I wonder if they ever returned.

The desert was unbearably hot.  Oppressive.  It’s late afternoon when the next car arrives. A pickup—sun-bleached, dented, the kind that rattles louder than it drives. The kind I used to drive.

I look up from my half-solved crossword as it rolls to a stop. Nothing about it stands out—until I see the driver’s face.

I freeze.

It's Mason.
 Goddamn Mason.

From back before the booth, back before I was whatever I am now. We grew up on the same street. Stole cigarettes behind the bowling alley. Worked summer construction together. He was the best man at my wedding. That was—hell, I don’t even know how long ago. Time doesn’t work right out here.

He looks older, of course. Sun-worn. Eyes like someone who’s been carrying grief too heavy for too long. But it’s him.

And he doesn’t recognize me.

He leans an elbow out the window, casual. Like this is just another gas station on a long, hot drive. “This the place?” he asks.

I nod, slow.
 “Yeah. This is it.”

He offers his arm like the others.

I hesitate. A blink too long.

Then I press the Diviner to his skin. It hums. Drinks. Reads.

The screen flickers.
 “December 18th, 2002. The garage. Before the fire.”

Payment field lights up:
 “Your son's voice.”

I don’t say anything. I don’t have to.

He stares at the screen, breath hitching once. Just once. Then he nods. Not a dramatic, movie nod. Just the kind of nod a man gives when he’s already dead in all the ways that count.

I press the button. The rusted toll arm lifts.
 He drives forward.

And slowly, quietly, fades into the shimmer—like heat haze swallowing a memory.

I lower the arm with shaking fingers.
 Then I sit back down.

And I fume.

I don’t know what broke.

Maybe it was the woman who smiled as she paid with her mother’s name. Or the kid in the hatchback who didn’t even blink when the Diviner demanded his own future. Maybe it was Mason.

Or maybe it was just the silence today. The nothingness.

I stare at the ledger, its pages thick with desperation. Everyone else gets to go. To the moment they lost. The person they loved. The place they never reached. And me?

I just take the toll.

I stand. Push the stool back. It scrapes the floor like it’s trying to stop me.

I step outside, feel the night air bite a little harder than usual. I walk around to the other side of the glass for the first time since I started this job—if you can even call it a job. There's no paycheck. No schedule. Just arrivals.

The booth hums behind me.

I do it just like they do. I roll up my sleeve. Hold out my arm to the Diviner, alone on its perch.

It’s not supposed to work on me.
 But the light flickers. The needle hisses out. I flinch. It still stings.

The screen stays black. No destination. No date. No desire.

But the second screen lights up.

“Payment Due: Last sense of why you stayed.”

I stare at it. And I laugh, just once—dry and cracked and hollow.

I reach into the booth. Press the switch.

The arm lifts.
 The wind stills.

I get in my car. The seat is still warm from this morning. I put it in drive. I take the road. I go forward.

As I drive, the world starts to shimmer. The line where road meets sky begins to tremble like hot air over pavement. I feel light. Then hollow. Then gone.

And then—

The alarm chirps rudely, waking me from the only thing I look forward to: sleep.

I sit up. Slowly. Head in my hands. Elbows on rickety knees. I breathe.

Then I start the day. Wake up. Hate consciousness. Stretch. Empty bowels. Dress. Eat.

I ended up going with Surfshark on a 2-year deal because the cost worked out to less than what I usually spend on one coffee per week.

I'm into cooking, dogs, coffee-culture, house plants (I know, I'm kind of a nerd). I work in the creative industry so I can talk about that as well. Not interested in talking to Trump supporters or people really into anima. Ohhh bonus points if you're into philosophy, lately I've been into Allen Watts and Ram Dass. We don't have to talk about that, it's just an ADHD hyper fixation right now. 

I'm usually hanging out on discord, so it's cool if you have that. 

Okay bye friends.

Keep it crispy.

https://preview.redd.it/m2c2afocotlf1.png?width=2095&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b13952359cd7665f1246f29f85ffb820ff2882d

He sat there, arms folded, spine rigid, lower lip torn raw from where he kept gnawing it. His face was blank in that way only young soldiers and broken dogs managed, like someone had folded a mask over his soul and stapled it shut.

I pulled the chair out slowly. Let the scrape echo. Sat across from him without a word. No dramatic monologue. Just me, him and the clock on the wall.

“Got your blood test.” I said eventually, voice dry. “Nothing too weird. Strong immune response. Fast recovery. No implants. That’s rare these days.”

No response.

“You’re not talkative,” I added, almost amused.

Still, the kid refused to answer, stubborn as always.

“Figured I’d ask you a few medical things. Just routine.” I steepled my claws on the table. “You allergic to anything?”

The kid stared past me, jaw clenched.

“You get sick often as a kid?”

I leaned in just slightly, casting a long shadow across the table. “You left-handed?”

His eyes flicked to me. First flicker of thought, then back to the corner.

Alright then, time for the hammer.

“We found your father.”

That got him. His pupils shrank. Jaw went rigid. I heard the faintest creak of his boots tightening around his feet.

“Gerardo Espinoza,” I said calmly. “Veterinarian. Lived near the old breed commune. Went missing before your birth, I think”

The boy blinked once, then again, I could see the rage boiling behind those glowing eyes.

“You don’t know a *damn thing,*” he hissed. Voice high with fury and fear. Still, he did lack the signature rasp and growl of the new breeds. “He was a *rapist.* A monster. He… he took advantage of her. My mom, she was *pure,* one of *us.* And that thing he ruined her! Got his hooks in her and broke her body. Killed her!”

The fangs were out. Bared like a cornered predator. His claws dug into the table hard enough to squeak against the plastic. I didn’t move.

“I *know* what happened,” he snarled. “They told me. The doc told me. Everyone told me. I wasn’t… I wasn’t *meant* to exist.” His eyes were glistening now. The fury was slipping sideways into grief. I saw it. Saw the boy behind the mask start to slip through. I stayed silent, just long enough for it to hurt.

I leaned forward carefully, trying to not startle him. The muscles in his arms locked up, claws still digging into the table like he wanted to tear the damn thing in half.

I let the silence stretch. I could hear his breathing now, shallow, jagged, like he was trying to hold his chest in a cage. This couldn’t be true, it simply doesn’t add up.

“That doesn’t make sense.”

His gaze flicked to me, sharp and defensive. “What?”

I leaned in, resting my claws lightly on the edge of the table, just enough to let the weight settle on him. My voice stayed low, careful, but the edge was there.

“You wouldn't exist if that was true. Everyone knows that old breeds cannot carry new breeds. So a lot of care and effort must've been put for you to be born, and that's not something that a victim of assault would do.”

I paused, waiting for the disbelief to settle on him.

“ The risks would’ve been too high. So... why did she try to carry you to term? In a commune full of people who dislike the new ones no less.”

His face twitched, his eyes flashing, but he didn’t answer. I let the silence hang again.

His breathing quickened again, but he still didn’t say a word. He clenched his jaw, refusing to meet my eyes. I could see it. The **churning** in his mind. The fight between what he wanted to believe and what I was pushing him to face.

I stood up, slowly, keeping my voice calm. He wasn’t ready to crack yet. But the fractures were starting to show.

“You know what I think?” I said, letting my claws tap softly against the table. “I think your mother carried you because she *wanted* you. You were a wanted child. You weren’t an accident. I don’t think you’re a rapist’s kid.”

I could see it then. The flicker of confusion in his eyes, the struggle. *He’s holding on to a lie that doesn’t even make sense anymore.*

“Kid, may I at least know her name?” I asked, hoping he wasn't too shaken to answer. He hesitated for a few seconds.

“Suzie,” he said solemnly. “Suzanne Halver, that was her name” tears were flowing down the boy's face now, framing his features in grief.

*Halver.*

A picture was forming in my mind already, the implications of this unraveling wildly. The doctor was most likely his grandfather, though there's no way to confirm this unless we get access to the commune’s records. 

“Kid, or should I call you Mr Halver? Do you-”

“Don't call me that!,” he spat, his eyes narrowed. Fangs were out again looking for an excuse to bite, the boy was so tense he was about to snap like a wire. “I… don't deserve her name.” 

“What should I call you then, young man? I have to address you somehow” I asked, watching as the kid fiddled with a loose thread from his newly changed scrubs. His anger was still palpable, but I could smell it was fading into grief.

“They call me Martin.” he said, finally.

“Thank you Martin, that'll do. I think that is enough for now. You must be exhausted too. We will continue this later once you've had something to eat alright? We'll talk later”

The hybrid kid didn’t reply, he simply looked sideways as if trying to escape the implications of our convo. Closing the door behind me, I let out a sigh. This is going to be a *long* day. This young one wasn’t meant to be a tool for these people, he barely knows who he is let alone the consequences of what he’s done.

As I feel the bile crawling up my throat, the unwelcome image of doctor Halver appears in my mind. If he truly is Martin’s grandfather, then the kid must be a conduit for all his hatred. The moment I saw that man I knew he was a snake in the grass, but I didn’t know just how bad it was. I will make that old buzzard pay for this. 

I pressed a claw to my brow, trying to settle the creeping sense of unease. My mind was already drifting, sketching connections that didn’t want to take shape.

That was when I heard him.

“Hey,” Chris said, his voice low but not whispering. “You-uh, you good?”

I blinked out of it. He was leaning just past the doorframe, one hand on the edge of the wall, shoulders drawn tight. He didn’t look tired. He looked relieved, hopeful even.

“We finally got a name,” he said.

I nodded once. “Progress.”

“Martin,” he added, unnecessarily.

There was a silence between us, but not an awkward one. I let him hold it for a moment longer before continuing.

“He’s still too shaken to give us more. You saw him. We push harder and he might bolt.”

Chris folded his arms, shifting weight from one foot to the other. “Yeah. I mean… yeah. That kid’s running on fumes.”

“He needs time,” I said. “And more food. Real food. Not ration bars.”

Chris snorted, and I caught the barest hint of amusement behind the exhaustion in his face. “Good luck getting the lieutenant to sign off on budget for that.”

“I’ll cover it myself if I have to.” I jerked my muzzle toward the hallway. “Come on. Break room. We’ll talk it over.”

He didn’t need convincing. He followed without protest, already reaching into his vest for that wrinkled soft pack of cigarettes he always carried. I’d stocked dried meat earlier, back when I still thought this would be a standard holding case. Now it was looking more like a war crime.

The break room was dimly lit, sour with old coffee grounds and the ghost of a thousand half-eaten convenience store lunches. Chris flicked the light on, muttering something about dead bulbs, then pulled out two chairs.

He dropped into his with a soft groan, already digging for his lighter. I sat slower, laying my claws flat on the table. Chris took a drag and exhaled toward the ceiling. 

“So. A hybrid kid.”

I grunted, just once. He waited a beat before continuing.

“There were always rumors, you know? Fringe boards, conspiracy nuts… Some guy swore his cousin’s ex worked at a blacksite with a half-breed toddler locked in a glass room.” He chuckled dryly. “But this? I never thought I’d see one.”

I watched the smoke coil in the air. “Doesn’t matter.”

Chris frowned. “Doesn’t matter?”

“Not right now. His biology’s less important than his connections. That doctor.” My tail twitched under the table. “Halver might be the boy’s grandfather.”

Chris’s brows lifted, his hand lowering the cigarette slowly. “Jesus. You think so?”

I nodded once.

“Damn,” he muttered. “Yeah. That explains a lot. Guy had this… twitchy energy. Kept looking at that room like it was haunted.”

I let the silence hang again before speaking. “You remember the smell in that room at the commune?”

“Yeah,” Chris said. He grimaced. “Rot. Like an old freezer that lost power and never got cleaned out.”

“Same stench on Martin’s clothes.”

He looked at me, then winced. “Shit.”

I gave a slow nod. “If I had to guess, they’ve been feeding him raw meat.”

Chris’s voice dropped. “Like he was some kind of monster.”

I met his eyes. “You think it was punishment?”

“More like a message,” he said, his tone full of  bitterness. “Starve him until he accepts it. Then give him the scraps. It’s a tactic. Break him, and then make him live like whatever you’ve convinced yourself he is.”

My claws tapped the table. *One. Two. Three.*

Chris added, quieter, “And that shaved head, that wasn’t medical. They wanted him to look wrong. Like a freak.”

I exhaled through my nose, low and long.

“That’s possible,” I said. I didn’t want it to be. But yes. That was very, very possible. Humans express individuality in many ways. The haircut being one of them. This would be a good way to strip Martin of his individuality, so his peers and even himself would only see the monster they wanted him to be.

We sat in silence for a while after that. Fifteen minutes, maybe? Chris had slumped into one of the breakroom chairs and was fiddling with a stress ball from the vending machine. I gnawed on a strip of jerky, jaw working automatically while my thoughts chewed something else entirely.

That poor kid, the room, the stench of rotten meat… 

Then my datapad vibrated nce.

The screen lit up. *UNKNOWN NUMBER*, but flagged with a blue-gold encryption band. Governmental. Obviously high clearance.

My jaw tightened. The jerky stuck in my throat.

“Excuse me,” I said, standing.

Chris looked up. “Trouble?”

“Not sure yet.”

I stepped into the hallway and accepted the call. The line hissed faintly before resolving into perfect clarity.

“Agent Colum,” came a man’s voice, smooth and confident. “Thank you for picking up. My name is Dr. Zev Rechter. I’m calling you today not with a warning… though I admit it may feel like one, but with a *favor*.”

My pupils contracted slightly. I knew that name.

“Dr. Rechter,” I repeated, tasting the name. That explained the encryption band. And the prickle at the base of my neck.

I’d read the file. Everyone in law enforcement had. Zev Rechter, one of the original architects of the Reclamation Serum. Former civilian biogeneticist. Now a special governmental advisor with more clearance than most generals. Someone you did not cross without expecting consequences.

“I’ve heard of you,” I said cautiously. “To what do I owe the honor?”

There was a brief and surgical pause.

“I’m calling,” Rechter said smoothly, “because one of our systems flagged a specific DNA query. It came from a local law enforcement server in that jurisdiction. The sample in question belonged to a halfbreed.”

He said the word with surgical precision. No emotion. Like he was noting the presence of a benign tumor.

“That so?” I said, keeping my voice even. “We run a lot of tests, Doctor. Some of them return anomalies.”

“Of course. But this anomaly was quite specific. Halfway between a baseline Homo sapiens sapiens and a recipient of the Reclamation Serum. Quite a rare thing.”

I said nothing.

Rechter went on, “I’m not calling to scold. I assume your interest in the boy is genuine. I admire that. But please understand, Agent Colum, there are very few people in this world who can detect a *hybrid* at a glance. Even fewer who would know what to do if they did.”

I exhaled slowly. My grip on the pad had tightened.

“So this is… what? A warning?”

“No,” Rechter said. “A courtesy.”

“I’m not your enemy, Agent. I simply wanted you to be aware that others are also aware. And if you’re planning to take any further action regarding the subject… tread carefully.”

Rechter’s voice stayed steady, every syllable perfectly weighed.

“It’s best,” he said, “that hybrids remain a myth. For public safety.”

My pupils tightened. “And what exactly does that mean?”

“It means the system functions best when things are simple,” he said. “Two paths. The old breed, or the new. One species. One genome. One society. Hybrids complicate that. They imply a third path, one we did not sanction. One that has not been studied or stabilized.”

Rechter continued.

“Look, Agent Colum… Biologically speaking, a hybrid pregnancy is an act of negligence at best. A male *Homo sapiens “atrox*” , that's the name the *wretched fossils* have given us, of course, with an unmodified woman, leads to an embryo that demands too much. Nutritional requirements. Skeletal mass. Gestation stress. The result is nearly always a miscarriage.”

“And the other way around?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t hesitate. “Even less viable. The modified female immune system rejects old breed sperm. Or kills the zygote before implantation. It's rare and fundamentally incompatible. Like trying to graft meat onto stone.”

I exhaled slowly, my claws flexing against the back of the pad.

“So what are you saying, Doctor?”

Rechter’s voice cooled. “I’m saying don’t leak this online, or to the press. Or there will be consequences.”

“That sounded like a threat.”

“No,” he said, “I called you as a favor. Others wouldn’t be so kind. The public believes hybrids are impossible, and it’s safest that way. Simpler, too.”

His tone never rose, never sharpened. It was the flat delivery of someone used to saying dangerous things in antiseptic rooms.

“If this becomes a scandal,” he continued, “if you go poking the bear too hard, someone will push back. Not me, mind you. I’m just trying to keep your case out of the gears. You wouldn’t like what comes out the other side.”

I paced a few steps from the table, tail thumping gently against the floor.

Rechter added, “As for your actual case, I admit I don’t have all the details. I didn’t order any of this, if that’s what you’re implying”

“Noted,” I said.

“I do wish you luck, Agent Colum. Truly. You’ll need it.”

The call ended with a soft click, leaving me with more questions than answers.

Recently found out about cork jazz festival and we’ve decided to road trip from Co Armagh down to Co Cork for it for 4 days which we’re excited about!

I wondered if any of youse would give us some suggestions as to good pit stops along the way (Kildare village is one such) to break it up and see a bit more of our wee island and for Cork itself (staying central and have Elbow Lane booked).

Hoping also to go to St Finbar’s Orotary and Top of Coom too.

Particularly love recommendations for food/coffee/brownies or baked goods!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **US Open Round of 32: Jiri Lehecka vs. Raphael Collignon – A Tale of Two Trajectories**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a player crushing a forehand cross-court. Jiri Lehecka, the 21st seed, is a heavy favorite at **-625 American odds** (implied probability: **86.2%**). That means bookmakers expect him to win almost as reliably as a New York City cab driver ignoring the speed limit. Raphael Collignon, the 107th-ranked Frenchman, is a **+400 underdog** (implied probability: **20%**), which is about the same chance of me correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip while blindfolded and juggling.

Decimal odds from bookmakers like Fanatics (Lehecka at **1.13**, Collignon at **6.25**) and DraftKings mirror this disparity. Lehecka’s dominance in the rankings and Collignon’s underdog status are etched in numbers as clear as a tiebreak scoreline. Yet Collignon’s recent five-set upset over Casper Ruud—a former world No. 2—adds a wildcard element. But let’s not confuse “upset” with “formula for repeat success.”

**Digest the News: The Plot Twist of the Century**  
Raphael Collignon’s journey to this match reads like a David vs. Goliath script written by a caffeinated screenwriter. Last week, he toppled 12th-seeded Casper Ruud in a **3-hour-30-minute marathon**, winning **6-4, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5**. For context, that’s the tennis equivalent of a 23-year-old Belgian first-year student defeating a PhD candidate in a 12-hour debate. Collignon’s victory was so seismic it earned him the Dutch phrase “**Beste dag van mijn leven**” (“Best day of my life”), though he might need a stronger coffee to survive this next round.

Lehecka, meanwhile, advanced by defeating Tomas Martin Etcheverry **3-6, 6-0, 6-2, 6-4**, a match that showcased his ability to bounce back from a set down. The Czech’s resume includes a career-high ATP ranking and a 2023 title in Geneva. He’s the tennis version of a Swiss Army knife—reliable, versatile, and unlikely to snap in half under pressure.

1n2nzlg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2nzlg,Took a month off fasting. Gained nearly 10lbs.,"I have been fasting to get off baby weight. You can see how quickly I was dropping the weight while fasting and how quickly it picked up once I stopped. I had some health issues so had to stop fasting for a month. In the first pic you’ll see I lost about 15 pounds in 6 weeks down to 144lbs. Then for the month I took off I gained up to 153lbs. Nearly a 10 pound gain from not watching what I eat. I did no portion control, plenty of snacking and ate 3 meals a day. I’ve been back at fasting for a week and have lost 2lbs and am ready to get back on the horse. 

How I fast: Switch to a sugar free coffee creamer (yes I know that this technically breaks the fast.. sometimes I skip breakfast, sometimes I skip dinner depends on how I feel). Then I eat 2 meals a day. One medium calorie 300-400cal typically and then I eat whatever I want for my second meal. Typically all the way up to 900cals. I eat out often so I am aware of the calorie counts that I typically order. No snacking. No exercising but I am working on adding that in. Works for me so far. Before I got pregnant I stuck with this type of fasting and it kept me in the 120s but I was also walking on hilly areas for an hour a day. I also ate out near daily.",6,1756414490.0,fasting,2,0.75,False

1n2nxte,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1n2nxte/day_1_my_challenge_seems_to_be_smoking_to_avoid/,Day 1: my challenge seems to be smoking to avoid something else.,"Yesterday at 6:30 PM I finished Allen Carr's book and smoked my last cigarette.  I'm using the Smoke Free app to track my progress, but over all today has gone well.  It's been 20 hours as of writing this.  I didn't sleep great, but I'm not a great sleeper in general so there's no telling if that was just normal not sleeping well or if it was related to not smoking before bed.  Other than that, I really haven't had the desire to smoke except once.

I have a house guest right now.  A family member we don't see often, but who I find quite annoying.  I generally only have to put up with this person once every couple of years for a week or two.  But this is where I realized there's one area I'm not prepared for!  I woke up this morning feeling fine- actually quite happy that I'm not smoking any more.  At first, there was some oddness to changing my routine, it just felt like I had more free time, which I though was something to rejoice for!  Then our guest woke up and joined me in my AM routine.  She started talking immediately about something I have 0 interest.  She's not a great conversationalist.  She tends to talk AT you, not with you.  So she'll go on and on for 10,15, even 20 minutes about a topic I don't want to discuss.  She'll follow me around the house to do this.  To the kitchen to fill my coffee cup.  To the living room to sit with my coffee.  While I'm doing my morning puzzles.  blah blah blah.  

This was the only time during my day so far where my brain went to ""I want a cigarette"" and I struggled a bit.  Usually if I go outside and light one up, she goes away.  But if I just go outside, she follows me and just keeps talking.  I didn't realize until this morning that I actually do something like this often- I use smoking as a way to avoid something else I dislike.  Maybe it's a person, maybe it's a situation, but it's something that I dislike almost as much as I dislike smoking.  

Anyone else use smoking to avoid things they dislike?  What's your strategy to work around these things?  I have 5 days left with this house guest...",2,1756414376.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

1n2nwmi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2nwmi,Review: Cayo Levantado Resort,"I found this subreddit very helpful so wanted to share my own review of my recent stay at the Cayo Levantado Resort in the Dominican Republic. Overall rating: 9.5/10. Would recommend!

**Dates Traveled:** August 20th - August 27th  
**Guests:** While the resort can host around 400 during the busy season, the week I went there was only 20-25 guests (I asked). We were a party of 2.

**Travel:** 7/10. I added in this section because it's almost impossible to travel directly to the hotel without subjecting yourself to a 2.5 hour car ride from the airport. I wanted to mention it because while the experience was worth it for us, unless you are flying from Canada you most likely will fly into SDQ. We booked transportation through the hotel, so wanted to include it in the resort review. While the roads to the resort are well maintained, on the way there, the driver offered us water (no snacks) and on the way back the car did not have water bottles or snacks. Once you are on resort property it is wonderful, but the transportation to and from the resort could be improved.

**Property** 10/10. The resort is situated on its own island off Samana in the DR. The property itself is stunning, the design work is really wonderfully done throughout the resort.  I constantly was taking pictures of light fixtures, sinks, plates, chairs. I had the chance to do a private ecological tour of the island and the care they put into maintaining and regrowing the natural landscape is evident. Outside of the nature, everything is very clean and well maintained and stocked.

**Room**: 9/10. We had the standard villa room, and our upgrade options were somewhat limited due to the fact we needed two beds. Most of the rooms were just one king bed, including all the beachfront rooms. The room itself is beautiful, the sheets very comfy, the minibar restocked well, and the design beautiful. Every night housekeeping came and delivered a local gift to the room, which was a nice touch. You can control the room from either the TV or the wall, which was nice, and the A/C was well functioning. The downsides - the bathroom has a ""window"" into the main bedroom, which means you can see into the shower from the bedroom, which is not my ideal. Also weirdly, the patio didn't have a door handle on the outside, so while you could open it easily from the inside, it was more difficult once you were out there. 

**Concierge**: 10/10 Personal concierge service was done via WhatsApp, which worked well for us. Every morning/evening they texted you a list of activities provided on the island the next day, from simple bracelet making to yoga classes to sound healing. (They \*really\* wanted everyone to do sound healing). It worked throughout the week and responses usually came within 1-2 minutes.

**Dining**:  9/10. Dining was interesting because it was the off season, they ran limited dining options and only had one restaurant open for dinner each night. While we did not mind it as it lead to you having the same servers every night and feeling of an atmosphere with other diners, there were times where I wish we could have chosen something else. Mostly because for lunch the restaurant Carey was open every day, and I had to specifically ask the concierge to pre-order a lunch item from another restaurant that would not be open that week. The buffet was also closed, limiting some grab and go options. However, all the food itself was fabulous, the coffee shop great, and room service is open 24/7. You can order off menu from room service as well to get items from some of the other restaurants, which was a nice benefit. Unfortunately, I don't drink that much so can't really comment on the quality of alcohol used.

**Spa**: 6/10. This was one of the areas I found the most lacking. While there are changing rooms/bathrooms in the individual room, there are no free to use facilities such as a steam room/sauna. There is a paid area that you can reserve for $40, but at least at the time of my booking some of the facilities in it were not working so they were offering 20% off. Inside the actual massage room there is a shower, but my therapist recommend I not shower, so I did not actually use the facilities. The waiting room was also very limited and seemed more of an afterthought. The massages were good, just the spa itself felt lacking.

**Fitness**: We didn't use the fitness facilities, but from all accounts they seemed fine and had free fitness activities every day. But we didn't use them so no review on that!

**Activities**: 8/10 Every day they had a list of smaller activities that required registration. I enjoyed them because it was a fun chance to talk to other guests and do an activity, but I wouldn't say they were standout. The ones they hyped the most were the fire dancing (only on Saturdays I believe) and sound healing (offered every other day). We also participated in a yucca bread making class, bracelet making, and sip and paint. They had DJs and music most nights, but with the lack of guests due to off season, this wasn't that popular (no fault of theirs!)

**Beach**: 10/10 The beach was also wonderful. There are about 5 cabanas (all free to use) and due to limited guests we never had an issue reserving one. Beach service was quick and efficient, often no one else was ordering anything. 

**Pools**: 10/10 Two main pools, both with their own bar and ample seating. Both great!

Recently got into making espresso and I am loving it! I have a Gevi machine, use light roasted beans from a cafe, and use Oatly Barista milk. 

So far this is my process for making iced lattes:

•make the espresso (2-3 shots) the night before, let it cool to room temp, then place in an air tight container in fridge

•in the morning, pour espresso in stainless steel cup, pour in milk, taste and add more milk if needed, add ice. 

The issue I’m having is that I feel like I am putting WAY less milk into my homemade lattes compared to when I get cafe lattes. I like my lattes to have a stronger coffee taste, but even so, I’m putting less than half a cup of milk into it. 

I feel like I’m messing something up, since whenever I put the correct amount of milk in it to make a 16 ounce latte, it tastes way too milky and almost watery like. 

Any ideas? Thx :)",1,1756414293.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I'm going to reschedule as soon as I can and try again. As much as it didn't comfort me in the moment, it does kind of help to understand that this is probably RSD and it explains a lot of moments in my life where I overreacted to relatively minor things that gave me a sense of rejection. I mean, they did literally reject my blood lol.",6,1756414265.0,adhdwomen,9,0.75,False
1n2nt2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1n2nt2a/comparisons_between_tacoma_and_just_seattle/,Comparisons between Tacoma and just Seattle,"While my husband works on his MSW in Seattle, we're looking for a move from Vancouver WA. He's lived around that area his whole life, and I've only been in America for a year (I'm from Australia :D).   
As a social worker, there are jobs for him in both places, his co-workers are the ones who brought up the potential of Tacoma. 

I am a barista, so I know I can make coffee anywhere, however husband has asked me to review both places, and I've been doing some googling but I'd love some personal accounts? I value first-hand-opinions very much. I get they're both cities, so if any more specific suburbs or areas within these larger cities could be recommended then that would be amazing. 

We've looked at places in Seattle already, so have an idea of what we want, but I literally know NOTHING about Tacoma haha.

Personal Preferences: (varying importance)

\- SAFE! Obviously bigger cities=less safe by nature of population. Being in Vancouver we're so near Portland anyway so I have come to rationalise the existence of houseless people. It doesn't bother me so much on a person-by-person as things like spiked violent crime would bother me.  
\- Asian population/Chinatown/Asian markets (I am Asian, it'd be good to have access to grocers, department stores, markets, etc)  
\- Affordable rent. We're aiming for 2500$ a month, 1 or 2 bedroom?? (more achievable in Tacoma, I know)  
\- Reasonable Public Transport/Walkability (A Seattle perk is my husband is a student there so he has that transport pass). I don't have a car, and usually prefer to walk to-from work, or have grocers available within walking or bussing distance (walkable for *me* is within a 40 minute walk, but I've had a day-trip in Seattle and don't mind walking around all day if it is safe enough).  
\- Small Businesses and Cafe Culture. I am working at a chain coffee shop but I know the chain I work at isn't in either location. I'm trying to steer away from Starbucks... Wouldn't hate a regional chain but preferably a small business? I'm a specialty Barista. (lol)

I would love to hear about people's experience living in these places! Remember this is side-by-side with me doing research online, so I promise I am not basing my choice on reddit users haha.",1,1756414065.0,SameGrassButGreener,12,0.67,False

**TLDR/ REVIEW:** I'd give this property a 9/10; it's probably the coolest vacation we've taken so far, the food/ service were great (for the most part), and I don't know if it's possible to get more relaxed at a hotel. I would happily go back if I wanted another completely secluded vacation. But it scratched a very particular travel itch in my brain, and it could easily turn out to be a terrible trip if you don't know what you're getting into beforehand.

**THINGS TO BE AWARE OF:**

* Long travel days to get there and back (spent 23 hours fully conscious and traveling on the day of checkout)
* No AC on the island ( really wasn't that bad for us, and we are a keep the house at 67-68F couple)
* Must be comfortable traveling through the rougher areas of Nicaragua, as the transfer goes through some of the poorest portions of the country.
* Also gotta be comfortable traveling in a country that is a full-blown dictatorship (we were not and cancelled our first booking, but after some discussion we rebooked)
* There aren't mosquitoes on the island, but there are gnoseeums(?) My wife and I were never bitten, but other guests were complaining about them quite often. (The bug spray we brought with us was Repel Lemon & Eucalyptus, but as long as you keep reapplying, the resort's bug spray seemed to work just as well.)
* The island isn't normally in the path of hurricanes, but in 2022, it was ripped apart by one. I'm not sure what their contingency plans are for that scenario, but something to be aware of as it's a small island in the middle of nowhere.

# OVERVIEW:

Calala Island is a tiny private island resort that's off the Caribbean side of Nicaragua. It describes itself as an ""ultra all-inclusive"" resort because the food/drinks/activities and almost all the transfers to get to the resort (I.E., a small plane and a long boat ride) are included in the cost of the room. They pride themselves on being sustainable, and they say they made the resort with the intention to be able to break down the resort at any time and return the island to nature with minimal impact. You can walk from one end of the island to another in \~7 minutes, and it only has 6 rooms or ""cabanas"", 4 regular and 2 that are master suites (Cabana #1 & 6); these ones are larger and have a bathtub. The standard cabana's retail price was $4300/ night when we booked (I have doubts on whether that rate is ever actually paid, but 2 of the 7 couples we saw did pay cash for their stay).

# GETTING THERE:

**To Managua (MGA):** To be able to start the journey to Calala, you first have to spend the night in the capital, Managua, because the small plane transfer requires you to be up and ready at MGA at 6 AM ( it was 5 AM for us, not sure why). There were only 2 reasonable flights that went to MGA: AA from Miami or UA from Houston.  We booked award flights from our home airport to MGA using the AA flight and arrived at 1 PM.

**In Managua:** After going through passport control (be sure to bring $10/person for the tourism tax), we met with a Calala rep outside of the Airport, Nestor. He drove us 20 minutes to our hotel for the night, the Hilton Princess (it was a nice hotel, but you should just book the Best Western that's next door to the airport), and he was the one who picked us up in the morning for our early flight.

My only real qualm with the resort was that they explicitly told us about the cash needed for the tourism tax, but I was under the impression that everything else was included. Nestor required $50 in cash for our transfers from the airport to the hotel, so there was some added stress to figure out how to get cash for him because we only brought credit cards, and Amex isn't widely accepted at ATM's there.

We received a call from one of the live-in managers, Claudia, after we arrived at our hotel. She gave the lowdown on the travel day ahead and what to be aware of while traveling through the areas of Nicaragua.

**Small Plane to Bluefields:** When we got back to the airport that morning, everything was handled for us, security was a breeze, and all we did was wait for the plane to show up. You'll either fly on a smaller Cessna Caravan (which is what we had to the resort) or a slightly larger plane, depending on how many locals are traveling to and from as well. It was an hour or so flight for us, and it was cool to see the landscape of Nicaragua. My wife didn't like the landing skills of the pilots, but otherwise the flight was super easy. (Our flights were nonstop, but apparently the plane can stop at other airports before Bluefields, and you have to be sure not to get off at the wrong one.)

**Bluefields:** After getting on the tarmac, we were ushered to the small terminal (lobby?) of the airstrip.  This is the last place to use the bathroom before the long boat ride, and it got a lot of cleanliness complaints from my wife and the other woman traveling to the island. After waiting a bit, we met the next Calala rep who traveled with us the entire rest of the way. He took our bags and arranged ""taxis"" for us ( junky cars the size of a Smart car), put our bags on the rack on top of the car, and then he rode in the taxi with the other couple.

Bluefields is in one of the poorest areas of Nicaragua, so be aware that it's a rougher area with lots of people, crime, and neglected dogs, but we were driven straight through to a makeshift port to board the speedboat. I was never uncomfortable with the experience, and it sounds like the resort tries to use the same taxi drivers to ensure nothing can go wrong.

**Speedboat:** At the port, we followed the rep to the boat, which is a decent-sized traditional Nicaraguan open-top speedboat. We were given life vests and a thick 2-piece rain outfit ( Bluefields is also one of the rainiest areas of the country). We were lucky on the way to Calala and had beautiful weather. The ride is 1.5-2 hours long, and my wife, who is easily susceptible to motion sickness, actually had no problems with either ride. About halfway through, we stopped at a dock and they gave us a cold prepackaged breakfast that was entirely ok, but was great after not eating anything all morning.

We then continued for another 30 minutes to the end of the river, where there's a government checkpoint. The rep got out and talked to some armed guards (we were warned not to take pictures at this point because, as dictatorships usually are, the government is very paranoid). After that, we just had 30-40 more minutes of traveling through the ocean ( a little choppier than the river) to get to Calala.

**Arrival:** We were welcomed by a large number of the staff (I think the total staff # is \~30) on the dock, where they had coconuts ready for us to drink, and had the resident musicians/gardeners playing guitar and singing for us. They took our bags and put them in our respective cabanas; then we met with Claudia and Leon, and they showed us around the island and gave us a long discussion on how the island works, but we ate 2nd breakfast/lunch during so I was happy.

They set up 2 WhatsApp groups, which allowed us to schedule activities/ spa with the managers and another that let us request food/drinks/ whatever else from the staff. The staff chat was only one-way, so there's no ability for back-and-forth conversations.

# THE RESORT:

**Room:** The base rooms I could see being a hangup for people. They are small for the price points \~500 sq ft, don't have AC, and with it being a semi-open cabana on an island, there were lots of bugs.

We were in Cabana #5, which is the one closest to the dinner side of the island. We weren't able to get an upgrade on any day of our stay since the resort was basically fully booked the whole time. I really liked the base cabana, it's not a luxury suite or anything, but it was nice. The only things I had problems with were some general wear and tear in some areas, and it was impossible to find the sweet spot between ice water and hellfire in the outdoor shower 🤣.

We were most worried about the lack of AC in the room; our weather at home in the summer is very comparable to the tropics, and we usually run our house's AC at 68°F. They give out 2 fans in each room, and it wasn't that much of an issue for us. During the day, it would get very hot in the room, but:

A. We spent the entire day in the pool or on the beach

B. If we did stay in the room, we found that leaving a door open and putting one of the fans outside pointing into the room really helped cool it down.

We slept really well, and it was a much better experience than I had expected.

The bugs were something we were expecting, but in general, we didn't have that much of an issue. Some little beetles in my wife's hair once or twice, and I had to murder one or two larger bugs that my wife deemed too big to let live. The other couples we talked to sounded like they had a lot more, so not sure if our fan outside trick also caused fewer bugs to be around or if Cabana 5 is just in a less bug-filled area.

The outside of the room had a deck off the back with a small table and a drying rack. A pavilion with a big, comfortable hammock and two surprisingly nice bean bags was close by in the sand. Both of those options were fantastic for a midday nap and were used every day.

We had a nice little beach access spot at #5, but the couple in #3 said that they had no beach.

**Pool:** We really enjoyed the pool and spent almost all of our time there; even with the resort being almost fully booked, it never felt crowded. We'd wake up, eat breakfast at 7-8 AM, and then go rot in the water till lunch (no other guests were ever out there before 10 AM). It has a really nice swim-up bar and is right next to where lunch is served.

**Beach:** The main beach area is pretty large, but we could tell that they were constantly fighting erosion. In front of the pool, there are a few loungers and the same bean bags/ hammock from the rooms. This area also had the water sports area further down by the dock. You can go in the water, but you have to be careful because there are sea urchins and stingrays that hide in the sea grass/sand.

**Spa:** The spa is all by itself on the mangrove side of the island, and I really liked its placement and proximity to the water. There's only one masseuse and she didn't speak very much English, but she did a pretty good job ($140 for a full body massage).

# FOOD:

The food and drinks were better than I expected (even with the high cost, I didn't expect much from an all-inclusive); only a few things we tried weren't very good, and that was mostly lunch options.

**Drinks:** They had a large selection of alcohols that were all included and had a section where you could pay for the more ""Premium Alcohols"" (think Dom Perignon). We were avid enjoyers of all the cocktails that we tried, with our favorites being the Rum Punch and Pina Calala, and they did not skimp on the alcohol. They are able to make any of their drinks into mocktails if necessary.

**Breakfast:** Started at 7 AM and went till 10:30. Every option we tried was great, with the standouts being the Island Burrito and the Huevos Rancheros.

**Lunch:** This had the weakest options for food, but the pizza they make with their homemade brick oven was fantastic, as well as the chicken/fish tacos; the jerk chicken was extremely dry, and I couldn't eat any of it. I believe lunch is from 12:00 - 4:00 PM, but you have to put in your order sometime before 1 pm and they'll have it ready at whatever time you decide.

**Dinner:** Dinner was pre-determined every day and was curated to dietary restrictions. My wife doesn't like most shellfish, so they would switch out hers with either chicken or beef most days. It varies day to day what they'll offer. We had a traditional Nicaraguan buffet the first night, a 7-course tasting experience the next (very good), Surf & Turf, and then a large BBQ platter on the last night. Dinner was the best and most entertaining of the meals ( they'd usually have either the musicians playing or some type of entertainment beforehand)

After dinner, they would ask us to select the type of coffee we'd like delivered to our room the next day and at what time we would like them to bring it.

# SERVICE:

Service was fantastic, everybody was extremely nice, and they would try their best to satisfy any requests. Most staff members we interacted with addressed us by name and would remember our favorite drink orders/ little requests. Our early morning in the pool always began with a 9 AM mimosa that we only ever asked for on the first day. After that, the bartender always just brought us one over wherever we were in the pool. My wife really enjoyed the little fruit art they would make for her drinks (I think she was the favorite on the island \^).

They refreshed the rooms every morning while we were at breakfast and did turndown service every night while we were at dinner. We never saw any housekeepers, and they'd deliver the coffee we selected at dinner, exactly at the time we specified every morning, so they have timing down to a science. The turndown service always included some kind of trinket that they would leave on the bed (we are suckers for free trinkets), like: a diablito(?) mask, an adoption certificate for one of the turtles, a carved turtle magnet, a beach bag, etc.

# Activities:

We were extremely lazy on this vacation, so we didn't do a lot of the activities. The ones we did do:

**Kayaking:** Really fun, they have a leaderboard on who can do a lap around the island the fastest. it felt a little bit weird going around everybody's cabanas, but we kept our eyes forward the whole time.

**Snorkeling:** I tried it, and there wasn't really much to see, plus the ladder from the dock was broken, so anyone with shorter legs than me would have had a problem getting back up that way.

**Rum Tasting:** They made this an event before dinner for everybody, and it was a lot of fun. Definitely wish we didn't do it the night before we left 🤣, but it was really interesting to taste the local rums.

**Hawksbill Turtles:** The island is basically a sanctuary for this specific species of turtle. There are nests littered around the island, and if you want to be woken up/ alerted for any hatchings, they'll both message you in WhatsApp/ knock on your door. We saw 3 different hatchings, and every time it was exciting, they'd let you release a few of them and then would release the full batch on the beach.

**Sloths:** It's also a sanctuary for sloths. I believe there are 3 on the island, but we only ever saw one of them. Same thing as the turtles, they'll wake you up/ message you for any sightings, but the one we saw, Flash, was content sleeping on the coconuts at the top of a palm tree, so we didn't get great photos.

# RETURN:

Checkout was handled at dinner the day before we left, and they spread out some of the items we could buy (we got another carved turtle and a bamboo phone speaker). They then asked if we would like to tip and how much; we chose to leave $400 or $80/day.

The return trip is just a reverse of the way we came in; waking up at 4:30 for coffee, they took our bags at 4:45, and we walked to dock at 5:00. We weren't so lucky with weather this time and it started downpouring pretty early on, but it was only slightly miserable; we would have gotten to Managua at \~10 AM if not for delays at the Bluefield airport.

It was a 23-hour travel day for us back to our Midwest state, but that can easily be avoided by booking another night in Managua and taking off the next day.

# COST:

At the time of booking, the points rate was 150k points/ night, so with the 5th night free, we paid 600k Hilton points for our stay. The cash rate was \~$4300/night, making for great value for our Hilton points (a record-breaking 3.58 cents/point!), but now the standard room rate has been increased to 200k points/night or 800k total, which would lower the cpp to 2.69. That's still way above normal for Hilton points, but

A. I personally think the cash rate is inflated and that most of their bookings end up being points/ charity giveaways.

B. It would be a bit harder for me to give up that many Hilton points, especially after paying only 600k for the first trip,

but I still think it's worth it and would go back if I needed another totally secluded vacation.

Seems I have gallbladder stones","I started developing some kind of digestive problem 6+ years ago. I distinctly remember going to lunch at work, then coming back to my desk, and about an hour after eating I was struck by cramps, dull pain, and extreme tiredness that was so intense it made it difficult to do my job. One challenge is that this didn't happen every time. Some days I was fine. There could also be stretches of a few weeks where I had no episodes at all, and then it would come back. Though over time, it's been getting more and more frequent.

I've had two different GPs over the span of those 6 years. I kept coming back because the problem was never fixed and it got bad enough that it was starting to impact my performance at work. I had tiredness after eating, but eventually that turned into me just being tired all the time, and even more tired after eating. I asked my doctor to do a lot of tests, and she was always reluctant. My most recent doctor stated that it was ""probably IBS"" and that the fatigue was ""probably just depression"".

I did an exclusion diet but I could never identify a specific trigger food. I tried quitting coffee. We did what feels like a billion different tests, only because I insisted. Eventually, I pieced together that my symptoms matched pretty well with gallstones. She didn't believe it could be that, but whatever, I got an ultrasound and a bile flow test with a radioactive marker. Both came out normal. She insisted that I should get on an antidepressant to treat my fatigue. I insisted that I had physical symptoms and that this could not be ""just depression"", but feeling like I was out of options, I accepted. I got pretty bad side-effects from the antidepressant (extreme insomnia), but no relief of my symptoms.

Eventually I got a referral to see a real gastroenterologist. It took a while longer but he eventually prescribed a CT scan. I just got the call today. He said they found stones in my gallbladder. They're small stones, milimetric he said, which makes them hard to see on the ultrasound. He also said that small stones can be the most painful, because they're very likely to get stuck in the bile ducts and to move around. He prescribed ursodiol and also a consultation with a surgeon so I can know more about surgical option and decide if that's what I want or not.

So anyways, hi guys! For me the pain is typically crampy, a dull ache, and the main symptom has been extreme tiredness after eating, to the point that I'm usually forced to lie down, sometimes for up to 3 hours.   I also experience uncomfortable bloating in my lower abdomen. This makes it pretty hard to work, as you can imagine. Though yesterday I also experienced pain right below my sternum, along with elevated heart rate, and pain in my shoulder. It was uncomfortable enough that I actually wondered if I may have a heart issue.

I'm wondering how many other people here have had debilitating tiredness, especially after eating, as a symptom? The gastroenterologist said usually they wouldn't do anything for small stones like this, they only do something when it's symptomatic, which it seems to be for me. I'm kind of scared of having surgery and then finding out that fuck, I'm still tired after eating even with my gallbladder out. My stones are pretty small so ursodiol might potentially work for me. 

So yeah, my main questions would be how many people had small stones and experience pain and tiredness, and how did you treat it? What were your main symptoms? How are you doing now?",2,1756413661.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

They left during the pandemic and I really haven't thought about them since. I was an intern on their team and after my internship they converted me to full-time. I learned SO MUCH from them and that whole experience, basically a crash course education on how the real corporate world works, and I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them and the risk they took on me. Unfortunately, around the start of 2021, I was one of the 10% that was laid off within that company.

They saw on LinkedIn that I'm now working at a different company as a program manager and wanted to set up some time for a coffee chat to know how it was going at that company. This is after not talking to each other at all in five years.

The problem is I no longer work at that company either. I was fired five months ago (pip or severance and I took the latter) and I haven't gotten around to updating my LinkedIn. I'm worried about two things coming up during the coffee chat that I'm not sure how to approach:

1. they're reaching out to see if I can refer them to the company I no longer work at, which then I'll have a lot of fun explaining to them how we parted ways in a year and a half or
2. they're reaching out to see if I'm interested in a position they have available, which then I'm worried they'll resend their offer if they find out I was terminated in such short time or if I say I am looking at jobs on the other side of the country to move in with my SO (which is true, but the job market is rough and I'd be open to staying longer in my city if the pay is good)

I know they could just be genuinely reaching out to catch up over coffee, but I also know that the company they're working at full-time is hiring, and the startup they work at part-time just published their first app too so I want to be prepared for either possibility.

She recently started a new job in events, and she loves it. She has made many new friends there, and they all get along well. They hang out and party together as a group. 

The other day, she mentioned, kind of jokingly, that one of the guys at work told her, “I had a dream about you.” I didn’t think much of it then. 

I know they chat at work and have gone to a few parties together, which I’m fine with. But recently, that same guy asked her if she wanted to grab a drink with him after work. 

She told me about it and asked if I was okay with her going. I said I’d prefer she didn’t, since it might give off the wrong impression. I suggested they catch up over coffee instead of drinks at a bar.

Let’s start by saying that I make the most delicious red velvet cake. The baker who made our wedding cake has become a great friend, and she shared her recipe with me (our wedding cake was also red velvet). Her only condition was that I don’t give the recipe out (as it is her bread and butter) and that I don’t bake commercially. I can live with that. So I made the red velvet cake a few times, and it is an instant winner every time. It is really delicious. 

Family and friends started to demand that I make the cake for every occasion (and non-occasion). If someone just drops in for a coffee, they expect the cake. If I say it is too expensive or too much work, they will make a face or even a comment. I got sick and tired of that, so I only bake it for my husband and me when we don’t have company. It is almost two years since I made it for someone else, but the demands just don’t end. I have said no. I have said “no is a complete answer, move on please.” I have said that I won’t ever bake that cake again for anyone else because of all the nagging, but it just doesn’t stop. I am so frustrated with it that I can yell. Over the weekend, someone started again with the comments, and I got up, greeted them, and left. Why can’t people just accept that enough was enough already?!?",10,1756413332.0,Vent,5,0.92,False
1n2ngne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1n2ngne/my_early_experience_with_alan_wake_2/,My early experience with Alan Wake 2,"I played Control some years back. I thought it was a pretty good game overall. I was really interested in Alan Wake 2 back when it released, so I bought it and never played it (average gamer moment lol).

Anyway, a month ago I decided to play the first Alan Wake game (and both DLCs); the gameplay definitely feels outdated but the story and the whole setup is awesome, really interesting game and a good run. Then, I played Control once more (with both DLCs as well) and, man, WHAT A GAME! It really, really grew on me; probably in my top 10 favorite games ever.

Let's take a detour on an important subject here; I. HATE. JUMPSCARES. I don't mind tense dark scenarios, or even creepy monsters and enemies. Hell, I think I even liked being spooked. Even when I've never been a fan of horror films, I love Resident Evil games, the dark, lonely, survival action-packed horror games make me happy; but the times I've been moderately scared in those games are pretty much really tense lonely situations where an enemy might come at me anytime (looking at you, iron maidens). 

But, since I was a 6-7 y/o kid I've had an aversion towards screamers and jumpscares. I'm pretty sure this fear was born at that age because I was in a computer science summer school and this 15ish y/o dude tells me to go over his computer and watch a video: it was the old timer white car though a road in some fields, the camera follows it all the way and BANG, a monster pops up screaming. That was it, trauma for life.

Some years later I found out it was a (german?) commercial for a coffee based drink. There are even 20+ commercials of that same brand doing the same thing. I know it was a dude on a costume with some sound FXs. I know it's not real. I know it can't hurt me. But I'm 27 years old and I still fell funny in my stomach when I see a picture of that ""monster"". I HATE. JUMPSCARES.

  
Back to the topic. I finished Control and both of its DLCs and I went to play Alan Wake 2. Man, I was so excited to finally be able to start playing it. The gameplay begins, the atmosphere setup is awesome, the shores of Cauldron Lake at night, about to go into a forest and 30 seconds in a f\*cking jumpscare pops up. It wasn't that scary, but it got me and, suddenly, the game is 20x more creepy, more tense. 

I kept playing, but as more jumpscares hit my face, the less I want to boot up the game and keep finding out what the hell is gonna happen in Bright Falls.

In 2 days (playing from 10pm to about 2am) I have only been able to get to chapter 3, where>!you start playing as Alan in The Dark Place setting of a TV Studio; I already met Ahti (love you, Ahti) and I'm currently at the subway station.!<

I already played with the horror flash settings; the lesser sound makes it more bearable, the image setting honestly makes no real difference to me as the mini-videos shown are actually pretty cool. But the single fact that, without a warning, a jumpscare will pop and give me a mini-heart attack just makes me not want to play it anymore. I can't stop googling ""Alan Wake 2 jumpscares reddit"" just to find a little comfort in other people that went through the same as I'm going through right now, I'm actually eager to go through the whole game as some sort of personal challenge, but it's going to be way harder than it should be.

I guess I just wanted to share my story, and how hard it is for me to play this game. Feel free to call me a crybaby and de-escalate the situation; or even share your feelings going though this game.



TL;DR 

I hate jumpscares and this game is full of them.

1n2nf53,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1n2nf53/does_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker_nespresso/,Does the best single-serve coffee maker Nespresso ENV300B live up to its hype?,"The Nespresso ENV300B is a sleek and versatile coffee maker designed to elevate your at-home coffee experience. As someone who takes their morning brew seriously, I was eager to test out its features and see if it delivered on its promises. Having put it through its paces for a few weeks, this machine has impressed me in several ways but isn’t without its quirks. Let’s dive in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that struck me about this coffee and espresso maker was its modern, matte black and glossy design. It sits beautifully on the countertop without occupying too much real estate, thanks to its compact 16""D x 7.5""W x 12.4""H dimensions. Despite its sleek appearance, it doesn’t feel flimsy. The materials used feel durable, and you can tell this machine was built to last. The detachable milk frother and adjustable drip tray are essential features that add functionality while keeping cleaning relatively straightforward.

**Performance and Versatility**  
This fully automatic coffee machine truly shines in performance. With six brewing sizes, from single and double espressos to 18 oz coffees, it covers all coffee cravings. During testing, I enjoyed experimenting with the one-touch milk recipes—cappuccinos, lattes, and hot foam—made effortlessly with the 16 oz dishwasher-safe milk tank. When pressed for time, the 30-second heat-up time saved the day, ensuring I could brew my morning dose of caffeine without delay. I even had relatives try the machine during a get-together; it catered to all their unique coffee preferences without breaking a sweat.

[Don’t miss Nespresso ENV300B deals—check Amazon here.](https://maisea.com/p/b0c5kf8yk7/)

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this espresso machine is as simple as it gets. The one-button system eliminates guesswork, making it beginner-friendly. The descaling alert is a nifty addition, reminding you to keep the machine in top shape, which is critical for consistent taste. Swapping between Nespresso Vertuo capsule varieties adds a layer of fun—there are over 40 specialty blends to explore. The complimentary welcome pack is a nice touch for first-time users, giving them a sample of the brand's premium coffee range. 

**Strengths**  
- The six brewing sizes and one-touch recipes provide incredible versatility.  
- Quick heat-up time dramatically reduces wait times in the morning rush.  
- Its detachable milk frother enhances both functionality and convenience.  
- The recyclable aluminum capsules support sustainability efforts.  

**Negatives**  
- Exclusivity to Nespresso Vertuo capsules limits options for those who prefer third-party choices.  
- It’s not the quietest machine, especially when brewing larger volumes.  
- Cleaning the milk frother, although dishwasher-safe, requires some attention to avoid residue buildup.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this device to other single-serve brewers in its category, its closest rival might be the Keurig K-Café. While the Keurig also offers one-touch milk frothing and various brewing sizes, the Nespresso edges it out with recyclable capsules and a broader selection of high-quality coffee blends. However, Keurig’s support for third-party pods gives it an advantage in flexibility. On the price-to-performance spectrum, both have their strengths, and your choice might come down to the preference for pod variety or capsule sustainability.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering this product’s features—quick heat-up time, integrated milk solutions, and six different brewing sizes—I would say it offers excellent value for coffee enthusiasts. It strikes a balance between premium features and affordability, making it worth the investment for those constantly on the lookout for barista-quality coffee at home. As someone who used to splurge on daily café visits, I’ve already seen savings pile up since adopting this device.

I lied a bit. I got farther than

I really really wanted to dig into the mouse on Sunday. I had the vision for how I was going to build it. I had the pcb done and the outline of all the components. Now it was time to just 3D model what was in my head and solve problems as they came up.

I started again around 10am after a morning cup of coffee and told myself that I would do as much as I could today. I didn't want to stress myself out too much but I wanted to have fun with it and see how far I could go.

My first task was to delete the existing M1/M2 support tray or whatever you want to call it. I try to give everything pet nicknames so I can name the sketches and the features in SolidWorks consistently but for some reason this feature is one I've never been able to be consistent on. 

Right after that I got to work creating the new pcb frame. I already had the pcb posts in place, I just had to make the crossmember to connect them. After that the frame to hold the scroll wheel came into place. It didn't see like it would be very strong but right after I made the supports to the roof. This suddenly shored up the stiffness of the whole skeleton. All I had to add was a 45 ish degree (very scientific) support for the rear hump and some width supports for the hump as well. I decided to use some carbon fiber rods for width support on the hump as I had some around for the last project that I ended up not needing but this mouse looks a bit more flimsy potentially. Finally getting somewhere!

Once I got the skeleton in place it was time to do some detail work. While there was a lot of miscellaneous little things that needed created I'm not going to go over that because that might bore the 2 people reading this (but that hasn't stopped you before?). I did however have to make the side buttons. This required making the mounts for the side button pcb and playing around the the positioning to make sure I could get it to fit. It had to not run into M1/M2 as well as be the correct distance away from the sidewall. Doing this took up way more time than I was anticipating but that just tends to be the nature of the beast a bit. Moving things around, positioning them, adjusting things, checking clearances, changing design and then moving it and start the process all over has a way of just eating up time. 

As a way to ""reward"" myself and feel like I was making progress I did the first render. It's always nice seeing the first render, when the product starts to look like a real object and more than just some nonsense you drew up on a screen that will never become reality. 

Finally it came time to make the side buttons. the M4 and M5 buttons are always some of the more interesting parts to create when modeling. This is because a lot of the geometry is based on organic surfaces. It's offsets of surfaces, intersection sketches and a whole lot of other points and sketches that are based on complex geometry. Even when modeling with proper procedure it's hard to plan these buttons out, you can make an outline in your master sketch but because I usually use splines, if too much changes they break. Dassault, I want to know, why a spline can be tangent to a sketch and it will break or claim it's not possible to be tangent if anything moves, but then I can delete the tangency, detach and reattach the spline, make it tangent again, and it's perfectly happy....until it has to move .005mm. Get fucked. Working with organic surfaces is a nightmare in SolidWorks. Offset sketches, surfaces, intersection sketches, it's all just the very opposite of robust. It breaks if you look at it wrong and then who knows how long it's going to take fixing it. 

I called it quits around sometime after midnight and sometime before 1am. Monday means going to work and pretending I didn't spend 20-30 hours of my weekend 3D modeling. Yay.",1,1756413110.0,u_MuffinmansStache,1,1.0,False

It's been a few years since I've been in any kind of serious relationship and I know I'm ready to date seriously again. If I get my wish, this will be the last time! I'm trying to build something that lasts.

Never married, no kids. I own my industrial loft near the city that doubles as my home office. Happy to share a selfie in DMs but prefer not to post publicly.

# About me

I run a small software consultancy that keeps me busy. After years in big tech, I traded the golden handcuffs for work that actually engages me. Less money, infinitely more satisfaction. Working from home means I've mastered the art of the 15-foot commute to my building's gym, which, embarrassingly, I only make it to 2-3 times per week anyway.

I'm a builder at heart. As a kid, blank paper was my drug of choice, then Legos, circuits, and finally code. These days I make everything: software professionally, but also robots, elaborate dinners, questionable art, and lately I've been diving into writing. I've discovered meet-up is basically a goldmine for finding other makers, and I'll show up to anything remotely creative.

I cook all my meals, eat healthily, don't smoke, and have maybe 10 drinks a year. My family's scattered across SoCal so I'm out there 4-5 times yearly for holidays.

Solidly atheist, but I spend probably too much time pondering ""why is there anything?"" Sometimes those rabbit holes feel oddly numinous. I'm a sucker for nerdy podcasts, which have become my go-to for quieting a busy mind at bedtime. They provide the mental white noise that finally gets my brain to chill out.

# What I'm looking for

Someone who gets that magical flow state when we're making something together, whether it's dinner, art, or just building a Sunday. You know that rare feeling where you're both just wordlessly contributing to the same thing, like you've mind-melded or something? That's home to me.

I need intellectual sparring. Someone who can follow my logic, find the flaw, and navigate my ego just right until I see it too. I fall too fast for dating apps (ironic, I know), so I've learned to start slow. Lots of talking, texting, coffee before anything serious.

I'm not fixated on marriage, but I love the idea of growing alongside someone through years, then decades, building something solid one day at a time.

# You should message if

* You can teach me something or show me where I'm wrong, because I often think I understand more than I do
* You appreciate someone who makes things with their hands AND overthinks everything
* You're looking for something real and lasting, not just entertainment
* You have suggestions for activity-based meeting spots where people are actually doing interesting things
* You're somewhere between ""let's debate whether free will is just post-hoc rationalization"" and ""let's just make tacos and see what happens""

Honestly, meaningful connections at any depth are welcome. Even if we just end up as friends comparing notes on how simultaneously exhilarating and terrible dating other humans can be, that's worth something.

Drop me a line. Tell me about something you're building, literal or metaphorical. Or just tell me your best anti-AI rant. I probably agree with more of it than you'd expect from someone in my field.",0,1756413079.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

A Due Diligence

Currently trading at 3-3.2$ a share and I am convinced it will be trading above 100$ within a five to ten year time horizon.

Fundamentals and Overview
Richtech defines their company mission as, “By harnessing the power of collaborative robotic solutions, Richtech is redefining the service industry landscape. Our mission is to drive a revolutionary automation of tasks, enhancing customer experiences, and enabling businesses to unlock their full potential.”

“Richtech Robotics partners with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Connect program to integrate NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing technologies, such as the Jetson Orin platform and Isaac Sim, into their service robots like Adam and Scorpion. This collaboration enhances Richtech's robots with improved body movement detection accuracy, faster development times through simulation, and more efficient navigation in complex environments. The partnership aims to accelerate Richtech's mission to make AI-driven service robots a common sight in industries such as hospitality, retail, and restaurants.” As we have seen over the last five to ten years, NVIDIA has become the industry leader in the AI and semiconductor market. With a market cap of over 4.4 trillion dollars, NVIDIA is positioned to the backbone of the technological landscape for the foreseeable future. Because of this, NVIDIA will be able to consistently supply Richtech with the most up to date technology for their line of robotics. Additionally, NVIDIA has a 50% voting share of the company so will be able to guide them financially as they make their transition from unprofitable to profitable. 

Market Opportunity
A majority of my positive sentiment comes from the FACT that low-skill jobs will be phased out of existence within a 10-20 year time horizon. I believe trade skills will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets. 
Enough about NVIDIA, let’s continue to discuss RR’s market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe Robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples
Steve Balmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.” Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution,

This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that people often side towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics), not denounce it. Don’t be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software
Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape
Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech’s competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the robotic revolution that I believe is coming. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030.
Future Potential
I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. The recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech’s 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you’ve got a company that isn’t just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively.
On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50–$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they’ll reconsider. This poses a good buying opportunity for us, as just as Steve Balmer said about the iPhone, public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to “capture the market share.” All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia’s CEO, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia’s scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate
TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go:
Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at ~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you’re in for being a long-term HODL the bag regard, I have unwavering faith that RR could be your Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.

Sometimes you go in thinking you’ll just check out one gadget, and suddenly it feels like Aliexpress is *absolutely shepherding* us into a field where ""cheap"" doesn’t even begin to cover it. Like… it’s so sheep, you almost don’t believe the price tags are real.  

But then my brain kicks in: am I actually onto something useful, or am I just being herded by brilliant listings and discount psychology? It’s confusing, exciting, and kind of hilarious all at once.  

- Some listings feel so ridiculously low in price that you start to suspect the universe is trolling you.  
- Others make me wonder if ""most sheep"" is basically the platform’s whole identity at this point.  
- And yet… sometimes the weirdest oddball product turns into the thing you actually needed.  

Take this, for instance. Whoever decided this was not only affordable but necessary might be a low-key genius:  

**Top On Sale Product Recommendations!**  
Ankle Fracture Fixation, Night Use, Daily Walking Brace, Foot Drop Fracture Fixation Support and Fixator  
**Price Now: USD 48.79** (Original price: USD 57.40, 15% off)  
🔗Click & Buy: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7  

It’s so niche that if you didn’t stumble across it by accident on Aliexpress at 1am… you’d probably never even imagine it was a thing. But somehow, here it is.  

And that’s where the whole ""most sheep"" energy really hits me.  
- First, it’s cheaper than expected.  
- Second, it makes you question how many other life hacks you’re completely unaware of.  
- Third, the vibe is like shopping in a dream: things are both surprisingly practical *and* bizarrely random.  

Scrolling Aliexpress can feel like playing a video game where the loot crates are priced lower than your coffee order.  
The excitement is real, the confusion is realer, and the temptation to “just try it” almost always wins.  

In a way, maybe the ""most sheep"" thing is less about the absolute price in dollars, and more about how much it *shears off* your sense of control.  
Like… you start with one click, and you leave comparing orthopedic support gear at 2 a.m.  
How does that even make sense?  

Do you think Aliexpress is uniquely ""most sheep,"" or do we all just secretly love how it makes shopping feel slightly surreal?  
Because honestly, I’m not sure if it’s the discounts, the randomness, or just the late-night vibes that make it such a wild ride.  

What do you think—am I overthinking this, or is ""sheep"" pretty much their business model? 🐑",1,1756412933.0,Trendinfo,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/qdatihlfktlf1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b8bce63b5c4900f268dca08ff10344594a58459

Here's her timeline...

On May 29th, Tracey bought my book, [The Instant AI Agency.](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency)

The following day, she'd finished it and started LinkedIn outreach to get coffee dates.

(𝘚𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘮𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘭 𝘧𝘪𝘳𝘴𝘵, 𝘣𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘥 𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘤𝘩)

On June 3rd, she sat across from a high-end personal training studio and demoed over Zoom. They loved what was on offer and are likely to turn into an AI partner (client).

On June 5th, Tracey had her 𝟐𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐝 with another biz.

But, before she could get to that, A last-minute coffee date with the CEO of a network marketing company came in, from a FB post she'd thrown up on her profile. He was blown away by the demo, so Tracey made an offer.

$𝟕𝟓𝟎 𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐮𝐩 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝟒𝟎% 𝐬𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 made, plus residual overrides on all recurring payments.

He bit her hand off and paid the invoice there and then. Tracey's now just waiting for his list of over 50,000 leads to run a test.

𝟕 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬!

𝐁𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐛𝐮𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐲 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞.

Congrats Tracey Walker. I'm pumped for ya.

There's a bunch of other people sharing wins like this in the group, and it shows that...

If you are hungry. If you put in the effort. If you 𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 and putting yourself out there.

You WILL get coffee dates. You WILL do demos. And you WILL land clients.

Now, you might be thinking $750 upfront isn't enough for Tracey to start thinking about early retirement? This is the wrong thing to focus on. The amount of cash you bring in on that first AI deal isn't what's important (it's a bonus). We all know getting that first deal done is the hardest.

Not because it's any different to the 2nd, 3rd, or 10th deal we do in how it's structured. It's the hardest because you have to overcome your inner critic.

* Can I even land a client using what I've learnt in a book?
* Will the biz owner take me seriously or will I get laughed out of the door?
* Are there any AI deals left to be done or is the market already ""saturated""?
* Do business owners even want this?

The list goes on and on because sometimes, that 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐖𝐈𝐋𝐋 𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐒𝐇𝐔𝐓 𝐔𝐏.

Until...

We land a deal and 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐬 that all the negative self-talk was coming from a place of fear.

Now, I'm not going to BS ya. That inner critic doesn't go away forever.

Tracey's probably got another internal voice whispering in her ear right now. But this time, it's a different kind of cynic.

* Can I even build this AI bot out?
* What if it breaks?
* What if I don't get them results?
* Will they pay me properly?

But again, this kind of 𝐚𝐧𝐱𝐢𝐞𝐭𝐲 (let's call it out for what it is) 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Once we've done ""the thing"", we realise it may not have been perfect BUT, It was 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐲 than what we'd built it up to be in our heads.

And next time, because we’ve taken action, we know what to do to make it even better. All you need is that first WIN.

And if you want a step-by-step framework that helps you shut up the inner critic, land that first client faster, and stack wins just like Tracey did… grab the [**Survive to Thrive Playbook**](https://honeysyed.com/flexxable).",1,1756412859.0,AiChampions,0,1.0,False

I need to make a dessert for a potluck tomorrow and decided on a coffee cake since it seems pretty easy and I’m a decent-ish baker. The recipe I want to use is Preppy Kitchen’s coffee cake, but the YouTube version, not the blog one, since I heard the blog version might have too much flour (?)

Anyway, the recipe calls for an 8-inch pan and makes 9 servings. I only have a 9-inch pan, and I don’t want the cake to come out too flat. I’m not sure how to scale the recipe properly, and I don’t have a kitchen scale, so I can’t really work with grams.

Would doubling the recipe work, or would that be way too much batter for the pan? If not doubling, what’s a good way to increase it to fit the 9-inch pan? Because I know a lot of people say it'll work either way, but I don't want the cake to come out too flat.

Also, side note, I know traditional coffee cake doesn’t actually have coffee in it, but I was thinking of adding some in just to make it extra good since everyone I know loves coffee. Do you think I should add some to the batter? Or maybe the icing? Or maybe just the crumble or the cinnamon sugar swirl inside? I want it to have a nice coffee flavour.

1n2n1fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tipstor/comments/1n2n1fr/how_dreampowered_ai_could_spark_the_next_big/,How Dream-Powered AI Could Spark the Next Big Invention,"The mind is a blurry cocktail of subconscious desires, late-night cravings, and half-remembered dreams. And now AI is stepping behind the bar to mix them into product ideas worth cash. The sleep-tech industry isn’t just whispering promises. It’s booming. The global sleep tech market leapt from USD 20.52 billion in 2024 and is expected to hit USD 65.69 billion by 2033 at a steady 13.8 percent CAGR, according to Straits Research. The more focused segment, AI-powered sleep optimization solutions, starts at USD 3.50 billion in 2024 and is projected to explode to USD 40.52 billion by 2034, charging ahead at a blistering 27.8 percent CAGR, finds Polaris Market Research. Sleep tracking apps alone will jump from USD 3.87 billion in 2024 to USD 4.69 billion in 2025, on a 21.3 percent growth spree, and aim for nearly USD 10.07 billion by 2029, according to The Business Research Company. In other words, the world is sleepless, wired, and watching the numbers climb like the morning sun.

Enter Dream Mining. The method is equal parts journalism on bad coffee and data alchemy. Anonymized user data from sleep-tracking apps is harvested. Not for medical diagnoses, but to eavesdrop on dreams, subconscious patterns, and nocturnal fixations. AI crunches the silent codes hidden in REM cycles, patterns of restlessness, the timing of deep-sleep spikes, and even patterns in midnight awakenings. It sees the longing for calm, for warmth, for the familiar, and translates that into product concepts. Weighted blankets that pulse with breath-like rhythm, aromatherapy pods that sync with sleep cycles, or smart pillows that whisper ambient soundscapes as you edge into dream territory. The system watches that user who awakens twice nightly at 3:13 a.m., then dreams of coastal rain. The next day, lifestyle marketers can ship a mist scented like storm-lashed pines, branded as “midnight clarity,” before the craving even consolidates in conscious thought.

AI and lifecycle management then cassette-tape the entire journey, install, trial, retention, fatigue, into a feedback loop more reliable than the sleeper’s muscle memory. If users of a new lavender-infused pillow drop off after two weeks, the system picks up the cue, nudges with a discount on a companion sleep mist, or prompts bedtime tips via the app at 9 p.m., preempting the drift away. If data shows 40 percent of users improve sleep onset by 50 percent when using audio-guided breathing, the next product features a “breathe-with-me” mode preloaded into the firmware. AI is tuning the narrative, not just launching one.

Trends emerge like dream symbols. Consumers trust AI sleep tech. 48 percent expect suggestions tailored to their profiles and 60 percent will share data for personalized guidance, notes WiFi Talents’s mattress report. Personalization boosts sales by 30 percent in the mattress world. Meanwhile, global demand for sleep-tracking wearables is building. From USD 4 billion in 2025 to USD 12 billion by 2033 at an 18 percent CAGR, according to Future Data Stats. Thoughtful brands are weaving AI with inventory and design, spinning scarcity into desire.

Case studies highlight the revolution. Eight Sleep’s smart mattresses adjust temperature based on sleep stage and have become something like ritualistic comfort. ResMed synced cloud-based CPAP devices offer remote compliance metrics to clinics, moving therapy into whisper-safe zones. Tempur-Pedic and Calm teamed up to layer multisensory content into their smart bases. Imagine waking not to an alarm, but a custom soundscape matched to your sleep depth. These aren’t gadgets, they’re dream curators, calibrated by generative and predictive tech.

The headline numbers back the promise. Businesses leveraging AI across functions see up to 16 percent revenue increase across manufacturing, R&D, and services, reveals an overview of AI’s business impact. MLOps, the machinery turning models into production routines, carries a market that rose to USD 2.19 billion in 2024 and is targeting USD 16.6 billion by 2030. And companies that go deep into lifecycle-driven customer success post 12 percent higher revenue growth and 19 percent better margins, according to Forrester studies.

This isn’t soft-science dreaming. It’s commerce wired into the synapses of unconscious behavior. Dream Mining turns pirouettes in REM into SKU roadmaps. Retailers don’t sell a pillow anymore, they sell uninterrupted dreams, curated by algorithms that know what you wanted before you woke. In a world where sleep is sacrosanct and technology intrusive, the operators who sneak into dreams intelligentlywill make revenue, loyalty, and restless night whisperers their allies.

1n2n0i6,https://v.redd.it/4xmt9y68jtlf1,Lodge at Blue Sky (also my first chubby review),"This is going to be a long review since I didn’t find many detailed ones about The Lodge at Blue Sky (Park City, Utah) before our trip. TLDR: it’s absolutely breathtaking and incredibly relaxing, where chic western cowboy style meets contemporary, eco conscious luxury. Don’t miss meeting their horses!

My husband and I stayed for 4 days/3 nights last week. The resort is about a 45 min drive from SLC airport. We booked through u/alex_travels during the Auberge summer sale, which gave us 25% off. We paid for the Sky Room, but the day before we arrived Alex emailed me to let me know she got us a complimentary upgrade to an Earth Suite Deluxe. We also received a daily $100 breakfast credit and a $100 resort activity credit.

Check-in was seamless, and they greeted us with cups of their house kombucha. Our suite was tucked a little ways down the hill and then back up again, but we didn’t mind the walk. The staff loaded our luggage onto a golf cart and dropped us off at our door, which was the only time we needed the cart again until checkout.

The Earth Suite Deluxe was absolutely stunning. The views, the ambiance, and all the little luxe touches! The suite was spotless and had a small fridge filled with bottled and sparkling waters, a big drawer packed with snacks and electrolyte packs, plus a backpack and two walking sticks. There was a De’Longhi Nespresso machine with pods and an electric kettle with individually wrapped Ikaati tea pouches. The bathroom was huge. The freestanding tub fit both of us comfortably, so we made a bath part of our nightly routine. They provided bath salts and oils, along with Auberge Spa’s Mountain Blend No. 49 products. The scent reminded me of a Jo Malone fragrance (I can’t remember the name). It was fresh without being overpowering. Housekeeping came twice a day, and in the evenings they left little surprises with a note - cookies, chocolates, and set up a little tea service.

Yuta, the resort’s only on-site restaurant, is gorgeous with amazing views. We saw some guests more casual and others dressed up. On our first evening, we ordered the everything Hawaiian bread, caviar hash browns, hiramasa crudo, gnocchi, pork chop, and chocolate mousse cake. Every single dish was fantastic. We ended up coming back several times during our stay for breakfast, lunch, and Sunday brunch. Make sure to order the cast-iron baked cinnamon roll. It was magical!

The resort offers a lot of complimentary daily activities like yoga, meditation, guided hikes, and my personal favorite, Meet the Horses. The experience lasts about an hour, starting with a pickup at valet that takes you down to the stables and arena. Our guide, Erica, was fantastic. She shared background stories about the horses, and it’s clear how much the staff love and spoil both their working and rescue horses. I told Erica that the last time I’d been on a horse was when I was 12 and I nearly fell off, but that I’ve always loved horses. She reassured me that their guided trail rides are designed to match each guest with the right horse. By the end of the session, she had us convinced to sign up.

Another unique perk is the fleet of Mercedes vehicles available for guests to borrow. They don’t take reservations as it’s first come first serve, but we never had any trouble grabbing one. We’re car people, so you can imagine how impressed we were when we got to borrow the AMG GLS63, Maybach GLS 600 SUV, and G 580 (electric G wagon). They also had sedans on hand, though I didn’t catch the exact models. We made it a point to take out a different car each day, whether we were heading into Park City for dinner or just grabbing coffee.

For paid activities, my husband signed up for the 2-hour sporting clay experience while I tagged along to watch. That wasn’t an issue at all, and I ended up having just as much fun as he did. Each guest is paired with an instructor. We had Nick, who was fantastic. They provided Beretta Silver Pigeon shotguns, ear protection, and glasses. I don’t know much about shotguns, but my husband said the Silver Pigeons were really nice, and he estimated he went through about 200 rounds. Nick drove us around the hilly course in a side-by-side and was such a great instructor. He paid close attention to how my husband was shooting and offered tailored advice without ever feeling like constant critique. My husband left smiling ear to ear and said the whole experience was well worth the price.

On Sunday morning we went on the 2-hour horseback trail ride, just the two of us with Erica (our same guide from Meet the Horses). Our horses, Boone and Cheyenne, were so sweet and beautiful. Erica walked us through the basics of getting on the horse and riding. We practiced in the arena first, which helped me quickly shake off my nerves. The trail was stunning and it included some steeper, hilly areas that made it even more exciting. Erica gave reminders throughout the ride about body position and direction, so I always felt safe and confident.

Now for the “bad” and honestly, I had to really nitpick to come up with anything. Our room was meticulously clean, but I did notice that the wallpaper in the toilet room was starting to lift in one corner. Two of the three SUVs we borrowed were out of windshield wiper fluid and had slightly dirty front windows, which is pretty normal considering you’re in the country. And when we checked in, they asked if we had any milk preferences for coffee/tea. My husband requested lactose-free milk, and while the staff said they’d stock the fridge with it, it never showed up. He didn’t mind at all and said the in-room espressos were excellent.

This was our first chubby vacation and we are completely hooked. I’m sure I’ve missed a few things along the way, so if you have any questions about the resort, feel free to AMA! Thanks.",43,1756412201.0,chubbytravel,11,1.0,False

I ended up being stuck in my office for the rest of my day, fueled by coffee. Emails and reading and writing, *ad infinitum*. I didn’t even realize what time it was when Bemlin came to grab me to leave.

“What are you working on?” he said, inspecting a red bulb on the string of lights he’d gotten me.

“The report. Putting in a quick little picture about the genes we found.”

“Is that necessary?”

“No, but it’s kind of cute. Look.” I turned my monitor around.

“This is cute.” He stared at me questioningly.

“Not like, cute-cute, but it’s… I don’t know. Cartoony and appealing to look at.”

The Gojid blinked. “It is time to go home.”

I sighed. “Yeah. You can go on without me. I’ve got just a few things to finish up.”

“To quote yourself, there is no need to stay late.”

“I’m staying late because my day’s been very busy and my boss will scold me if I don’t get the report submitted.”

Bemlin considered that for a moment. “I shall see you tomorrow, then.”

I didn’t spend too much longer on the report, only throwing in a half-baked paragraph about future directions and having some AI software tidy it up a bit. I titled it *Evidence for Previously Unknown Genes within the Gojid Genome* and submitted it publicly. I wondered if anyone would find it helpful or even look at it. Maybe not, but writing them also helped me. It was a professional and concise version of the dozens, possibly even hundreds of pages of notes I’d accumulated in such a short time.

I grabbed my things and shut the door to my office on my way out. I went to the lab.

Celso was easy enough to spot. He was moving small volumes of liquid between various tubes. Maybe something PCR related.

He noticed me and waved his tail in greeting. “Hey!”

“How’s it going?” I greeted. “PCR today?”

“Yep, of the mutagenic variety! I’m putting in some of the loss-of-function mutations into the pET80-VF constructs. The first of many on the list to be cloned.”

“Oh, already? Really getting ahead of things! Great! Are you headed out soon?”

He dispensed some liquid and ejected the tip into waste. “Maybe. I had to prepare a few reagents and it took longer than I thought it would. I don’t have a problem with staying late, though. Got to make up for me missing over half my day, right?”

“We’re making good progress regardless. But if you feel it’s absolutely necessary, just know I’m not forcing you.”

“No worries! I’ll get these reactions prepared, throw them into the thermocycler, and then head out.”

I nodded. “Also… I want to apologize about earlier. Bemlin and I kind of… not exactly disagreed, but weren’t aware of each other’s views, I guess. I got a little heated at what he said, and I realize that might’ve been awkward and a handful of other things for you.”

“Oh, that?” he dismissively said. “Nothing to worry about! It’s no big deal, I get how people are.”

I frowned. “Um… To be entirely clear, I want to do *everything* in my power to make sure you’re treated fairly and equitably here. I’m not going to just… watch things happen. The same goes for everyone else, obviously, but… well…”

Celso set his pipette down. He briefly glanced at me, then back at his tubes, a thoughtful expression spread across his features. The long silence led me to expect some kind of strong reaction, but he simply perked his ears back up and resumed his pipetting. “I appreciate it, but it’s nothing, really. I’m just glad to be working here. Doing science, and all that.”

My frown deepened. “Well, no, it’s not nothing. This isn’t some horrible research station run by bigoted Federation colonizers, this is a joint cooperative effort Venlil Prime has with the UN, and it’s not going to be *anywhere close* to the former.”

“No, you’re definitely right! But Bemlin’s a nice guy. Fun to talk to. I’m not fussed about it at all.”

“He’s great, but that doesn’t mean your comfort is any less important. Right?”

He stood up, carrying a tube. “This lab is plenty comfortable. The markers work and the gloves fit. Can’t ask for much more.”

“…But just so we’re clear, *you can*. I can’t make changes if I don’t know they might be needed.”

He placed the tube into the minus twenty freezer. “Yeah! I’ll keep that in mind. I appreciate it.”

Something in his responses left me unsatisfied. “And… you should feel confident that you belong here. Regardless of galactic happenings.”

He simply laughed, walking back to his seat and picking up a pipette. “Well, you know. I’m working here, right? You hired me, so I must be valuable somehow.”

I wasn’t sure if that was a joke or not. I opened my mouth to tell him I didn’t care about any “primitive” nonsense, but the words fell flat on my tongue. I realized, perhaps too late, that I might’ve been making it worse by pushing the topic further. It really wasn’t my business to get into his, or how he felt, or his reasonings—especially if he didn’t want to talk about it.

“Okay, all good. Just… let me know if there’s an issue? Any kind of issue at all. I want to make this a place for everyone, like I said.”

“Yep!” he said, staring intently at the tiny volume of liquid in his pipette tip. He was polite enough to keep the enthusiasm in his voice, somehow, but I could tell his answers were short on purpose.

“Good. Sorry… for, uh, bothering you.” I walked out.

A great sigh escaped my lips. I’d probably handled that in the worst way at the worst time. He was busy, staying late with an experiment, and I had probably been far too blunt even when it was abundantly clear he didn’t want to talk about it. I only succeeded in making an awkward situation. I had a good track record of doing that.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Acetli, Overwhelmed Geneticist***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 29th, 2136*

I was unfortunately growing accustomed to what the workroom was like without anyone else in it. Tanerik and Bemlin had left a little while ago, leaving me alone, jabbing and poking at the black box of statistics and numbers that was this GenomIQ AI program.

I didn’t mean to stay so late, it just sort of happened. I’d get lost in reading documentation and changing a few variables in the program and whatever else my mind latched onto. If I wanted to prove it was (or wasn’t) a fluke, I needed to give it a fair chance, which meant I needed it to work the best it could, which meant I needed to *understand it*.

I scanned my notes for the tenth time… or maybe it was the twelfth. I’d been spending most of my time with the Krakotl genome, attempting to recreate what Doctor Scheele and I had done with the Gojid genome to little success. I felt like I’d get close to an appropriate number of genes (whatever that meant, I still didn’t understand what Scheele had said about standard deviations), then I would change one tiny little setting and the number would suddenly be several times smaller. And trying to understand *why* that happened wasn’t any less frustrating.

I tugged on my ears and decided this paw would not be the one I got any good answers. I logged off and left, noting the time as nearly a quarter claw later than I was due to leave.

Out of agitation, I took the stairs. I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn’t spot the man sitting on the floor until I was almost right in front of him.

His legs were held close to his chest as peered over them at his holopad. The small white spots across his grey fur were familiar; I recognized him as Rosim, one of the researchers I’d met on my chaotic first shift. He seemed more acquainted with Doctor Scheele than the others, although that didn’t make his meek position on the floor any more impressive.

For a moment we just stared at each other, both apparently surprised at the other’s presence. Finally, he stood up and straightened himself. He was surprisingly short, at least half a head under my own. “Uh, hello. Acetli, is it?”

“Good paw, it’s good to see you again, Rosim,” I greeted. I briefly wondered if I should ask the obvious question or mind my business and keep walking. Briefly. “Why are you sitting in the stairwell?”

“Ah, well, I was on my way out when a notification appeared on my pad, and I… stopped to read it. Stairs are healthier than the elevator, and sitting like this is more comfortable than it appears, and… it’s quiet.”

I regarded him, not entirely satisfied with his answer.

“I… Sorry. I heard you, but thought you were a janitor. I, uh, don’t usually sit here.”

“I don’t usually take the stairs,” I lightly added. “What were you reading?”

“I’m sure you know about it. Doctor Scheele just recently posted a summary of the week’s findings, and it caught my immediate attention.”

“No, actually. I didn’t know he made summaries,” I said, taking a step closer to peek at his pad. “What all does it say? I wonder if it has my work in it.”

“I was only—” Rosim paused, then reconsidered. “That’s right, you work in his group. It *would* have your work in it… Are you busy at the moment?”

I cocked an ear. “Not exactly, but I was just about to leave.”

“As was I, before I became occupied. Would you… perchance want to grab a drink and discuss research? There is a cafe a very short walk from here, they make excellent tea.”

I hesitated, but only for a moment. I did want to get home, but this was also a great networking opportunity. “I’d love to join you! There’s a lot to talk about, I’m sure.”

His tail wagged wildly. “Excellent!”

–

“Ooh, this is good,” I said after a sip of my tea. The blue-tinted liquid was the perfect temperature, and the flavor reminded me of rainy sleep claws back home. The rest of the cafe was warmly lit and pleasant, though there were an unusual number of Sivkits populating the place. I wondered why.

“Yes, it is,” replied Rosim. “I first came here a year or two ago, before any of… anything happened. I never thought I would’ve become a regular customer.”

“I might have to become one myself. It’s in a pretty convenient spot for me, just on the way to the bus stop.”

He chuckled. “Quite the opposite for me, really, though it’s not as time consuming as I thought it’d be. I only say that because the research building from my previous job had a cafe on its first floor. I do miss it, though perhaps they could implement one into the second or third building they’re rumored to start refurbishing.”

I cocked an ear. “They’re refurbishing another building? You mean the current one was refurbished?”

“Oh, well yes. It wasn’t *much* work as far as I’m aware, but following previous cooperative efforts with the UN—the exchange program or the cattle trade to name a few—I believe they expedited other programs such as ours.”

I flicked my ears. That also explained why I never saw anyone go in or out of the few buildings that surrounded this one. I probably should’ve done more research on where my job was located. “I’m surprised they got it up so fast.”

“So am I, but it does make sense. I believe they wanted to get this one up as soon as possible just to get personnel working, then consider expansion at a later date. Based on performance metrics, I suspect.”

“So we’re an experiment,” I concluded. “How do you think we’re doing, so far?”

“So far? Definitely not disappointing, but perhaps not stellar. We had a second meeting this paw, in fact, that Scheele was invited to but didn’t attend.”

I lowered my ears, feeling secondhand shame. “He has told me that any email I send him has a good chance of getting buried. He might’ve missed it.”

“I suppose he did. Both the United Nations and our own government have emphasized many times that our research should be as cooperative as possible, where possible. I find that surprising, considering they’re predators, but I’ve been attempting to see it through despite Scheele’s… uh…” He shook himself and took a quick sip. “I suppose we’ll find out when the rest of the humans arrive, and how Nalek manages it all.”

“Nalek… The one who got me mostly set up on my first shift?”

“That would be him, the head of facilities with gleaming white wool. Hiring is one of his… lesser responsibilities, I suppose. Somewhat of a ghostly figure, haven’t seen him since *my* first shift. But yes, he and his human counterpart oversee much of the overall research effort, so its growth does somewhat depend on them.”

The tea I’d just put in my mouth turned sour. “So… worst case scenario, I might be laid off?”

Rosim chuckled. “If you become a particularly pointy thorn in their wool, perhaps. But for cooperative research in general, I don’t foresee that happening in the slightest. I doubt our government would even agree to this if they didn’t think it would go anywhere. If anything, our jobs might be *more* secure because of that fact.” He took a sip of tea. Then, in a quieter tone, he added, “And as much as certain branches of media like to spin things, the exchanges and cooperative endeavors with humanity have, overall, been wildly successful.”

I allowed a laugh to whistle out. “Well, that is half the reason I even found this job. Humans have brought a lot of interesting opportunities with them.”

“It appears that way, yes. Although personally, I am not so much interested in working *with* them as I am working on the insights they bring. Doctor Scheele is terrifying.”

“It’s better when he doesn’t stand,” I agreed. His mask also helped; I hadn’t seen him without it on, but I felt his gaze probably wouldn’t have made things much better. I could probably force myself to look at more human faces until I felt less afraid, as I’d done similarly before my interview, although that wasn’t exactly an enjoyable experience. “But you get used to it… mostly.”

“Ah, yes, his stature is very imposing, but I was referencing his approach to research. The way he discusses things and asks questions… It’s so rapid and overwhelming. I should hesitate more to call it this, but it’s simply *predatory*.”

I thought for a moment, debating whether or not I agreed with Rosim. Doctor Scheele was certainly unlike anyone else I’d worked under, although the very points Rosim said to dislike were the ones I found inspiring. With the human, there was no hesitation or fear. When he wanted to know something, he immediately took action without a second thought. And he knew *exactly how to do it*… allegedly. As much whiplash as it gave me, I found myself craving that level of ambition. It reminded me of why I wanted to go into science in the first place.

“How are you managing it?” the researcher continued. “Working under a predator, I mean. It must be overwhelming.”

For some reason I took offense to that, even though there was nothing wrong with his statement. “I’m handling it quite well. He is as you described, but only to himself, I think. He’s very accommodating of our individual experience levels and what he expects of us.”

Rosim gave me a look like he didn’t want to believe me. Then he took a sip of his tea. “In any case, that brings me to my next point. What are you working on?”

“I’m using a human-made AI to look for genes that KeiVei-Lay doesn’t recognize.”

“And you’ve been successful?”

“Well… sort of. I think. We found three genes without—”

“Without introns,” Rosim finished. “Yes, I saw in Scheele’s report on the Gojid genome. He claims they might be *artificial*.”

He looked at me expectantly, putting his cup to his mouth.

“Well,” I began, “I don’t entirely agree with him either. That’s why I’m currently looking at another genome, the Krakotl. The hope is that by looking at enough species’ genomes, we can determine if these genes the AI found are actually worth looking at.”

“And what do you expect your results to be?”

I decided not to tell him the *entire* truth, feeling oddly defensive of something even *I* didn’t expect anything of. “I don’t know. It would obviously be expected that the AI is generating false positives, but Doctor Scheele seems very confident. Tanerik and Bemlin are looking at the genes we’ve already found to try and prove they serve a purpose and are found in more than just one genome assembly. Regardless of my expectations, I’m going to give it a fair chance to work.”

“Hm. At the meeting, on your first day, you seemed… quite skeptical. As were the rest of us no doubt, but I’m curious. Have you changed your mind the more you’ve worked with the human?”

“You shouldn’t ask me; Bemlin’s known Scheele for much longer than you or I have, and he sides with him on almost every topic. Plus, Bemlin is far more experienced than me at basically everything.”

“Uh, yes, but a somewhat fresher perspective could be helpful. Perhaps less biased?”

I took a swig of my tea, and considered that for a moment. “I would say I haven’t changed my mind, but I have become more… open to new ideas. That said, I’m still very resistant to what Scheele has us working on. It’s actually very surprising—no matter how much I call his methods into question, he never seems even the slightest bit annoyed. And I do it *a lot*.”

“Has he ever been wrong?”

I sighed. “No. I mean, maybe, but I haven’t decided yet. I’m still working on applying what we did to a few other genomes. I was *so sure* that the AI’s discovery of a few genes in the Gojid genome was a fluke. I mean, no introns? Come on. The AI is begging to be proven unreliable. But with how confident the human is, and after I’ve looked deeper into everything that goes into finding those genes… I’m not so sure. That doesn’t mean I *don’t* want to prove the AI is unreliable, though.”

Rosim took a long, slow drink. When he set his cup down, his expression was contemplative. “I fear you may be fighting a losing battle. You’ve seen that ‘Gamma Fold’ humans have. If structure prediction is assembling a skyscraper, finding genes is playing with sticks.”

That caught me by surprise. “You mean… you would trust the AI?”

“Maybe. Maybe not. The truth of the matter is that these ‘learning models’ are able to detect patterns that traditional methods simply cannot. Facts can sometimes be very distressing.”

“But that would mean KeiVei-Lay isn’t showing us everything.”

Rosim stared down at his empty cup, rapping a claw against it. With a sigh, he rose from his chair. “It was good speaking with you, though I must get going. My young ones will be missing me.”

“Oh! Yes, of course, a pleasure talking with you!” I bowed my head. “I’m looking forward to where your research is headed.”

He returned the gesture. “And I look forward to yours. I’ll be seeing you.”

I watched him leave the cafe. My cup of tea was far from empty, and I finished it in thoughtful silence.
