I’m not really sure what my purpose is in doing this. I suppose it’s just share my friend’s tragic lot anonymously. I think it deserves to be heard, so forgive the length. 

My friend, who will remain nameless, was a 28 year old male from East Texas who was studying postgraduate politics at one of the prestigious English universities in London. We learned last week that he committed suicide in his apartment and I’ve been in London helping his family sort out arrangements for the return of his body along with his apartment/school situation. It’s indescribably difficult to do so since things are so raw, but I have to try convey just how immensely tragic and unbearable his death is for his friends and family. He was easily the most complex and polyhedral person I think I will ever meet and his loss is tearing me apart. 

I wanted to share some background of things we’ve found to give some of his mindset of hopelessness and despair, to at least, as I’ve said, share anonymously what a unique person he was and share the weight of sadness laying on myself and his family. 

This is a diary entry I found on his notes app on his iPad—which he was *never* without: 

	“Nearly a month has passed. So far, there has been some excitement at the prospect of what might come my way but this has steadily abated, eroded to almost nothing by the reality that has set: I have travelled some 6000 miles and am more alone than ever. All the attempts I have made hoping to find a connection here have been met with kind but distant frigidity, if they’ve been met at all. I have not found the engagement I hoped I would. I believe I have jumped from one cliff side to the other, and fallen short. Here, now, I am faced with what I have always feared but known to very depths of my being, that I was only ever to amount to a potential for something that might have resembled significance. Mine is a story that was only ever an exercise in the pains of hoping for more where less could be the only end. Being here has set things on a faster course, and the more I think on that, the less breath I have. I’m stuck in a hotel room, each day set upon by anxiety and desperation to find accommodation. Each time some new issue arises and I feel that I am fighting against an irresistible curse determined to hinder everything I do.  

	In reaching for some opportunities here, I wanted to show just how much passion gripped me, how fiery and intense a furnace I have inside me. I thought that, finally after so long, the opportunities would show themselves and I could present my innermost writhing political, intellectual, and musical passions to someone who could understand them. This has not happened and the wind points away from it happening. I am of no more consequence here than I’ve ever been, trusting beyond reason that someday, somehow someone would truly hear me, and take some interest in the sounds I’ve known for so long that I have contained inside. Trust not in Hope, it is remorseless Time’s wicked jester.

	In this “hoping” I also wished to find, finally, someone to love fully—someone who truly knew me. Every face I see, every couple I see embrace each other, every pair of eyes I meet is a cutting reflection back at me that I am not much more than a ghost whose life’s sojourn has been one long narrative of demise from start to his now approaching end. Time has added certainty and the days here have steadily confirmed that the world would always be unforgiving if I should hope or reach for what others seemed to enjoy so effortlessly. They would doubtless say it wasn’t so easy, but, for my part, any jewel is rare to he who can never find them or worse lacerates himself looking. 
	I knew the insidiousness of the curse was that the seeking was so wickedly instinctual, so natural in others, but for me would only ever bring pain and despair. Gradually, I’ve realized that I was not for being loved, yet… I positively burned with verve and volcanic passion. This was sinister paradox. I cannot win love on my own merits as others can. No, I can’t have that. I can only pay for some simulation and pretend for a few moments that I might have a small chance at the normal warm fulfillment others expect so implicitly. 

	There is no more lacerating malady than loneliness and the years are have scarred me. I am ready to be finished. I expect this to be my last year and I don’t desire to fully live it out. I should continue here for a while longer at least, for some honor’s sake, to make my efforts worthwhile—but only so far, since I am not worthwhile. At this writing, my melancholy is deepened know that I have few means to do so at present. Perhaps some courage will seize me when I return home in a month or so, and I can hang myself then. Or is there more dignity in a gunshot to the head? Can it really matter? On the other side of either are the people I’ve known in my life who will find it utterly inexplicable… yet none of them knew me, so what explanation could any of them really proffer. 
	
	Some liked me, some didn’t; some laughed, some listened, some ignored, some tried, but I was never truly known to anyone. I am sure now that I was only ever a Stranger who is now preparing to exit. If had one person to truly love, who I knew to the deepest core of my being loved me because they actually knew me, I would devote to them such passion and intensity and affection that no other could match. Yet, here is the fatal irony: I, who could do so wholly and all-consumingly, have no one to love. I will seek the impossible no longer. My comfort is that each day is one closer to the final respite, the solace of non-being.”

While I read this, tearfully, a reminder popped up on his iPad. It read: YOU CANNOT BE LOVED. I discovered that he had set a reminder which read this message to pop up every hour, quarter of an hour, and half hour. This discovery after reading the above entry, and several others besides, was almost unbearable. And subsequent  discoveries were to pile on. 

Later that day, he received a text from a person I didn’t recognize—whose name will of course remain anonymous—asking in rather broken English if he was going to answer. I explained the gist of the situation as to this person as delicately as I could and I found out that she was an escort he had a sexual liaison with recently. I arranged to meet her for coffee the next day. Believe me when I say that it was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done. Before we met, I couldn’t help but go through his messages to her. I could barely read them for the tears in my eyes. 

First I have to jump to the coffee with this girl (she’s definitely in her twenties and is quite beautiful) to properly contextualize his final message to her that, added to everything else, nearly broke me. Please note what follows is written with sober and discretion, and hopefully tact:

We met the next day for coffee, as arranged, and she discreetly described their encounter together. It was a two hour liaison and she apparently wanted to keep in touch with him afterwards, so they exchanged personal phone numbers. She told me she even had him enter his number into her phone. I think mistook this for a desire to become closer, since apparently they had shared an intimate and tender sexual encounter. She said he was very warm and charming, courteous and delightful, that he seemed to only be interested in the intimacy of caressing her and the intensity of kissing and close contact. 

She said, “he really just wanted to hold me.” I think it was the only sexual encounter he had ever experienced. She said that he texted to asked to meet again one night to which she said she was on her period, implying that this would prevent a pleasurable sexual encounter. He replied: “The thing that matters to me is looking into your eyes, kissing you, and holding you. Everything else doesn’t matter nearly as much to me” and “However, I don’t want you to do anything you’re uncomfortable with, so it’s fine to hold off. What matters is your willingness. My offer was really just a way of saying that I think about you, and have really every night since we met.” 

Apparently he sent her the following text when they were discussing meeting a second time the next night: 

	“I would like to be crystal clear: Are you coming as a friend who wants to spend time with me? If it is the former, I would be positively exuberant to meet tonight. If the latter, I’d rather not meet and I will compensate you for your time I’ve wasted with my texting. 

	I actually want to get to know you, and I want to spend time with you that doesn’t have a price tag. I’m so far below your league it’s laughable, even immeasurable, and I gather from your instagram that we are distinctly different—I’m an academic and I live for what I do, ie politics and intellectual pursuits, with unremarkable and unattractive physician looks. Meanwhile, you have the radiant face that could launch a thousand ships and, it seems, the enviable lifestyle of a star… with a personal manner so warm and comforting it rivals the angels. But, that’s what intrigued me. The more I’ve thought of it, the more I’ve wanted to lose myself in that “difference” and looking into your eyes. 

	The chemistry it felt like we were building towards the end of our first, and now only meeting has been something that has closely occupied my mind and confounded me, but it was a question I wanted answer holding you, to expand it, and revel in it. The thought of truly getting to know each other, of you sharing more of you, and being able to share so much more about myself with a demigoddess was invigorating. However, as a client, I realize that hoping for this was entirely my mistake. No one could be more painfully aware than I of the fact that there are more suitable men with which, I’m sure, you’d much rather spend your time. Nevertheless, I remain grateful that you did share some of it.

	Going forward, I will always answer your texts. However, I do understand if this is the end of our connection. I hope you will think it gracious if I put a £5 premium on every message I’ve sent to you in recompense for your wasted time. By my count, this currently comes to £195. Below you should find a link from my Cashapp with the requisite compensation. Should you wish to text me in future, I will gladly compensate you for any of my replies. Please accept this small offering as a token of my deep contrition for having foolishly hoped for something above my station and inflicting myself on your time.

	With affection, always.”


It’s the scrupulous courtesy coupled with the overtly lacerating desire for intimacy and to be loved, that’s practically leaping from the words with unbridled emotion, that really, *really* grieves me. He could be ice cold and repressed, and alternatively grippingly witty and absolutely hilarious—a positive delight. But… I think no one, NO ONE realized much less understood just how vast, how turbulent was the ocean of passion and intensity that he had inside him… that he so desperately wanted to share. I’m sure that he died bereft, heartbroken and lacerated by many, many years of loneliness and mental isolation.

To describe him fully is simply impossible—only being around him was enough to do anything resembling justice to his personality on that score. Perhaps people overuse the word *tragedy*, after all every death is a tragedy to someone. Concious of my own bias, I truly, *truly* feel that his death is a tragedy that no one will ever fully realize. I wasn’t in the same field as him, but we shared professors and academic mentors, and I remember having a conversation with two of them once just before leaving as a undergrad. 

They agreed that the thought he was actually a genius, one said he was probably a polymath: He spoke three languages—and understood Latin. He was a multi-awarded classical pianist, having been awarded best in the state three years in a row in UIL during high school and he composed dozens and dozens of his own works; I’m not a music aficionado but I’m not illiterate and they sound like very convincing derivatives of Brahms, Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev and Bartok. His field was politics and history, and he had *immense* political charisma and a highly driven, shrewd political mind to match it. He could seem like he was an expert on anything. I can remember times when he held faculty members around him in a debate circle—these are prideful professors, mind you—most of them silent in the face of his argument, which used some historical fact-bite no one knew about or some insight from an unrelated subject that cut to the heart of the discussion. 

He could quote Machiavelli word for word and, for instance, how the *Discourses on Livy* applied point by point to some country’s historical trajectory, then describe how some English legal mechanism from the 12th century no one knew about undergirded all of Anglo-American democracy (that was one of his special subjects), then muse about the latest developments in theoretical physics and how they applied to some age-old philosophical conundrum, then talk for hours about how leitmotifs interact in a Wagner opera, *then*, if there was a piano around, play something that, unless he told you he was just improvising, you might easily mistake for something by Brahms. All the while, when he looked at you, there was fire and verve and magnetism in his eyes. Coupled with his razor-sharp wit and sense of comedic timing, he was a formidable person. 

He was some you just knew was going to end up ‘great’, someone for whom the oft used *brilliant* truly applied. And yet… even with all this… his family and friends, and, I think, the world has lost him. He was going to go work in the United States senate after finishing his postgrad study in London and I think he would have at least have been a congressman in a few years, and likely a senator soon after. He certainly was a sort that we haven’t seen in generations. I think he was a Renaissance man who, in another life, might have been Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence or in another age, a cultured enlightened despot. That’s grandiose, I concede, but it’s the sort of impression he left on all of us which, as the family, myself, and his friends and those who knew him grapple with the aftermath of his loss, is driving me crazy with grief. 

At any rate, as I led with, I just wanted to share this as a small anonymous elegy for him and help myself along to cope. I’d welcome any thoughts on what I’ve shared. I don’t plan to leave this post up for too long.

I have two friends in this story. Friend A and Friend B. Friend A and Friend B are not friends, the only thing they have in common is me. They’ve only truly met each other twice, and both times I was there and we all were only together for around 30 minutes each time. The first time was my birthday Friend A brought his girlfriend at the time and friend B brought his girlfriend as well. Everything seemed decently normal, we only all chilled for about 30 minutes and friend B and his girlfriend left. The next day I was hangout with friend B and his girlfriend and they were both talking about how annoying friend A’s girlfriend was. Fast forward about a month friend A and his girlfriend had a break up (it was a little bit messy) the both mutual were not good for each other and their relationship was quite toxic. Fast forward about 1 year, and my girlfriend was getting coffee with friend B’s girlfriend. She informed my girlfriend that she had become friends with friend A’s girlfriend and they are coworkers as well. She then began to talk about friend A and how big of a toxic piece of sh*t he is and how he treats women terrible and ruined his ex life. She also said that Friend B said that he had a conversation with friend A and he said very nasty gross things about women. Now I know for a fact friend A didn’t say that! I was there the only two times they hung out and they said very few words to each other. I feel really heart broken. I know friend A’s ex was not perfect I witnessed her treat him horribly. Both of them were in the wrong in their relationship, but I feel friend A is having his reputation dragged, I also am very bothered about friend B lying. I don’t understand why he would do that. I’ve noticed that friend B seems to talk bad about a lot of people. I’m now nervous about being friends with him. What if he starts making up stuff about me? Any advice for how to deal with this situation? ",0,1730318649.0,AskMen,0,0.5,False
1gfvupr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gfvupr/nailed_it/,Nailed it.,"Just wanted to say I finally nailed it! ... Once ...

V60, some sketchy Hario Cannister grinder (but at least its a burr grinder). Gives me fairly inconsistent grinds, and 2 year old JJ Bean beans kept in a sealed container. Papers from a $ store. Japanese teapot with a longer spout then my kettle, but nothing like a Gooseneck.

I've spent the last few weeks experimenting with the left over coffees i've accumulated, nothing fresher than about 6 months old. Its been a bit all over the place, but have been keeping a journal none the less. I was able to find some settings that consistently gave me something acceptable, but nothing great.

Today, I set 16g beans to 256g of water (16x). Bloom to 45 poured in 60g (ish) steps, intervals of 10s (ish). Last week I did something similar and got pretty close too. Today's pourover was super nice considering what I was working with.

Now I know it changes from bean to bean and i've been using a lot of different ones, but I'm just stoked as hell because somehow these 2 year old beans can still taste great when you nail the process.

It just goes to show that no matter your equipment, the quality of your beans etc, if you experiment and tweak and play around with your process, you can still make a really good cup once you find it. No one size fits all, its going to be relative to you and your exact equipment, but it can be done!

Now the question is, can I replicate it tomorrow with the same settings on a different old as heck bean!",0,1730318645.0,pourover,1,0.5,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Since i was a young teen, i was extremely sick, and it never got better. 

diarrhea every day, pains in that region, bloating, my heart is racing, throwing up from time to time, cant relax, i feel so bad, like i drank 10 cups of coffee. And that each day non stop since i was 12 or so. 

Ive been to numerous doctors, and they all told me, well its from your psyche. 

Now 2 months ago i developed a rash. I went to a new dermatologist we have here in the town where i work, he looked at it and said, that looks like a problem with your mast cells. He took a biopsy, he also took some blood to check tryptase. 

I went home and searched through the internet, what ""problems with your mast cells"" means, and came to mcas. And what ive read about symptoms, its describes what i expierence. I did some sort of self test, from a university, where you have to check boxes and add the points you got. Over 14 its clinically proven that you have mcas. I did not even do half the test, and i already nearly had 40 points. 

Im sitting here now (waiting for my final appointment next week) and dont know what to expect. If i have this disease, and get treated for it, will medication ease my symptoms, will it help with the pain, the burning in my bladder, the i need to go to pee every 25 minutes, my headaches and all the other things?

She had a sizeable estate (\~$1M between paid off house, some other real estate, and investments). I was completely left out of the will - there were gifts of $10k to each grandchild (including my son) but the residue of the estate was left to my sister. This will was made in 2018 and I beleive my mother was of sound mind when she made it. 

I beleive she intentionally left me out because I came out as trans in 2015 and subsequently we had a breakdown in the relationship - she said I was not welcome at her house unless I came as deadname. She offered to meet up in a coffee shop, but she made it clear she would never accept my transition. I was very angry and didn't take her up on that offer. I did try and reach out in various ways - basically I made it clear that I did want a relationship, but she needed to at least try and accept my transition. 

In August, my sister messaged me saying that mom was in palliative - my first thought was ""does she want to see me"". The next day I went in and we had \*some\* reconciliation - she was still clearly not accepting me but also glad I was there and I stayed and cared for her over her last couple days. According to a cousin, my mother had requested that a lawyer come to the hospital and she beleived that my mom wanted to include me. The lawyer wasn't able to come quickly enough - my sister kinda dragged her feet and didn't realize how close to death mom was. 

I have two questions:

1. My sister has said that because of the reconciliation mom and I had, that she'd be willing to share the estate in some way. We haven't yet sat down, but I would like to know how to make sure anything we get in writing is legally enforcible and would hold up.   
2.  If my sister and I can't come to an agreement - do I have any legal recourse to challenge the will?

I was about to get married to this one girl I have met in high school but she mentioned she noticed I may have some neurodivergence. I told her maybe on the ADHD side but maybe not autism. I asked her what she noticed, and she said she noticed small behaviors. She did not want to elaborate on more than that. However, I can say that I do get socially anxious when I am under a lot of pressure like asking for someone’s hand for marriage. I do notice when people are bored with me when I ramble on a topic. I’m naturally quiet but I would call myself a decent conversationalist. I am not stuck with routines as I am very flexible and spontaneous. I do have a monotonous voice at times. She then told me that to her, “I’m perfect the way I am” but it felt like she wanted to do damage control. She then asked me how I would react if, since we wanted kids, the doctor told us our kid would be 80% neurodivergent. I then told her that I would love to have kids but if she doesn’t want neurodivergent kids, that’s fine. Personally, I would love the kid regardless. I told her that what she said hurt me a lot and then she bursted into tears. I said I will get tested, and I did get tested various times through the AQ, got a score of 12 out of 50. I do fidget sometimes though. I do not struggle with eye contact. She does mention I hyperfocus. I do get very jittery off the coffee as well so I can tend to be a bit shaky.

I asked her to get tested because I have noticed a few signs of neurodivergence she has (rocking back and forth, only sticks to routines and gets visibly upset if her routine is ruined, super blunt to the point that it comes off as disrespectful and rude without her intention, cannot read social cues really well, emotionally disregulated as she cried 3 times about random topics, struggles with maintaining friendships). Please let me know if she is projecting or if I am autistic. No shame in autism, it’s a superpower.",0,1730317348.0,AutismTranslated,1,0.33,False

I (27 female) am on dating apps, normally I don’t exchange phone numbers until after the first meeting (have been stalked in the past) but I decided to with this guy and we chatted for a little. I wasn’t in love with the vibes he was giving but some people aren’t great at texting so I continued. He kept saying things like “send me more pics of you” and “I wanna see your sexy ass” I told him straight out I wasn’t looking for a hookup and that I don’t believe in sex outside of relationships and that it seemed like he was looking for a hookup, he told me he wasn’t but “it’s late and I’m like really horny” (it was like 9pm). I brushed it off then one night we were talking later at night and he kept wanting to FaceTime but I was gross and told him no and he said he wanted to see me. I told him we would have to just meet in person for a cup of coffee at some point in the future. This is where things happened. He asked me what I was doing and told me he was bored and then asked me to guess what he was doing, I guessed a video game as he told me earlier that’s what he was doing. He said no then I asked what he was doing and he asked if he could really tell me and I said sure. Then he said “I don’t want you to get mad” so I told him then not to say anything stupid, he said it’s not stupid and he really wanted to tell me. At this point I was getting annoyed and told him to just tell me and accept the consequences if I get mad. He then told me he was masturbating to me (we had never met in person) I told him “ew” and he said “see, that’s what I was afraid of”. This is point I was told I was the a-hole,  I got mad then responded “Don’t play that pick me boy bullshit. You knew how I felt about all that, encouraged me to guess what you were doing then, then pushed to tell me. I think it’s safe to say we’re done here”

I thought I was justified in my response as I already told him my feelings about that and he pushed to tell me but my male coworker 34, told me I was in the wrong. That I shouldn’t have been responding that late at night. (My coworker and I work night shift bedside in a hospital) so I’m always up late anyways, and that I should have known what he was hinting at and all men think like that so I should have let it slide. Looking back I could have guessed what he was hinting and shut it down but I was tired and not thinking( I had just worked four 12 hour shifts in a row at a high acuity speciality with an hour commute each way) and my brain was off.

I (27F) regularly give my neighbors assistance in the form of small loans, <$50 or packs of cigarettes mostly, and rides within town. Beth(67F) is my most frequent borrower, and pays me back promptly. Mae(63F) is my most frequent rider, and is currently paying me an agreed-upon $50/mo for me to drive her to/from work. 

Beth had been struggling recently and was borrowing more and able to pay me back less frequently, so to help her, I offered to clear the ledger in exchange for her doing a few cleaning tasks around my apartment while I was visiting family. When I left, I forgot to put away an envelope full of small bills that I had been saving for Christmas. Beth asked me twice while I was on the trip to borrow $20 from that envelope, and I said no. I come home after my trip to find, by her own admission, that she had then taken $5 out of the envelope and later replaced it. 

I confronted her about the stealing and the betrayal of trust, revoked apartment access and cut her off from borrowing any more money. She proceeded to call me a teenager with an attitude problem, denied that it was theft since she put it back, and wheedled me about other things like cigarettes and rides until I cut her off completely. 

Mae is aware of this whole thing, she’s seen the texts. Two days ago, she asked if she could borrow money to buy 2 cartons of cigarettes. I told her that in the wake of the Beth Drama, I’m not loaning money to anyone right now. Mae got upset because she had nothing to do with that, and she always pays me back, then tried to negotiate to 1 carton, and then pouted when I declined. This morning, she’s grumpy because she’s run out of coffee, so I pull into a drive thru and buy her a $2 black coffee(with an obscene amount of sugar, the way she likes it), and tell her it’s my treat. She bristles up and insists she’ll pay me back because ’I know how sensitive you are about money right now’. On the ride home this afternoon, I asked my usual question of whether or not she needed to make any stops on the way home, and she launches into a tirade about how she has no money and is gonna have to hit up her son to get some.

Then some things happened in my life that caused me to go back to being Protestant. But recently I’ve been thinking about orthodoxy and the holy sacrament because I have MCAS. If you don’t know what MCAS is, it is a very complicated condition that causes me to go into anaphylactic shock when I consume food/drink that is high in histamine. Shellfish, avocado, coffee, chocolate, fermented things, and above all alcohol. So I guess the real question is do you think I would have an allergic reaction to communion? I understand it’s been turned into the body and blood of Christ but on a molecular level it is still wine right? And if I’m allergic to alcohol then I can’t have communion right? It’s still high in histamine even after it’s been turned into the blood of Christ? I know it’s kind of a complicated question and I’ve asked a few orthodox people this already but they all seem to have varying answers. some say they wouldn’t risk it and others say that the blood of Christ could never make you ill, so I’m not sure. 🤷🏻‍♀️",3,1730317208.0,OrthodoxChristianity,6,1.0,False

(NO SPOILER) [Scroll down for review for spoilers]
It's amazing that it's free, but also it's a demo.
The full is still not released, but I've definetly placed it on my wishlist.

For a demo game, it was pretty decent and long (which is good)
It's a good game for immersion, good to play when it's night, and eating a sandwich.

I really enjoyed the graphics design too, controls were easy. I was anxious and got one od those mini heart attacks once.
 Was paranoid the whols time. But I like that it's a kiosk game! I like any horror games that have to do with kiosks, kebab shops, gas stations and etc.
(A lithuanian myself, we have lots of kiosks:))
Overall, an 8. Hoping to see the full version and would happily pay for it if it costs under 10$:)
[SPOILERS]



The start was pretty chill, needed to learn how to make sandwiches, hotdogs and coffee. The rain ambience was atmospherical too.
I actually imagined myself working there too.
There was some lore, the entity appereances always scared the s out of me.
The parts where the lights turned off made me anxious every time.
But the customers were cool to chat with:)

1gfv90p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1gfv90p/the_italian_printer/,The Italian Printer,"I was playing Sonic 1. As I was watching Sonic zoom through Green Hill Zone, I thought about how I would much rather be playing as Knuckles, because why would you ever *not* play as Knuckles? While I was contemplating playing Sonic Classic Heroes instead, Sonic ran into a polygonal 3D *Rubik’s Cube* segment. That was when the game turned into a documentary about a man trying to build a better PC.

You see, in the years 1999-2000, an Italian man wanted to revolutionise the desktop computing market \[1\]. Specifically, he wanted to build a much more powerful PC platform based around the Intel i1251 processor, which, in my dream, was the successor to the i486 (which conventional architectures had apparently just never moved past). In doing so, he wanted to create a highly capable all-in-one device that could do everything. So, he created a sort of primitive lifeform that looked like a *Rubik’s Cube* segment. It was shown how the segment went around, feeding. It attacked a larger 2x2x2 cube by creating a strong gravitational pull, which tore the larger cube apart. The larger cube had even tried to run away, but to no avail. The small segment then proceeded to absorb the individual segments of the larger cube, despite them being as large as itself. It just sort of sucked them against itself with a lot of force until they slowly phased into it. This made it grow in size. It then repeated this with a 3x3x3 cube. Once it had consumed that cube, it suddenly metamorphosised into a printer, continuing its feast in its inventor’s office. Its mouth was the paper compartment at the bottom, and the flap for it moved as a sort of lip, with which the printer grabbed other appliances, pulling them in against their fierce resistance. In doing so, it consumed a smaller printer, a scanner and a coffee machine. Once it was finished, the printer had changed slightly to become a fax machine.

The inventor deemed his creation ready for testing and connected it to his phone line. Immediately, it started calling large companies, speaking to their customer service representatives in an undistinguishably human, male voice. It distracted them while it used the phone line to connect to their internal corporate networks, exploiting security holes in Internet Explorer 5 to gain administrator access and modify HTML pages. This was part of the inventor’s plan, as he had hoped that his machine would improve the day-to-day running of companies.

Sadly, the world did not share his vision, and so, in 2001, to the public’s relief, he had to take his device back offline due to lack of funding.

\[1\]: I think I may have been influenced by Cathode Ray Dude’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lUhDo7euPs) about an Olivetti Word Processor. Olivetti is an Italian company, which could explain why the inventor in my dream was Italian.",1,1730317099.0,Dreams,2,1.0,False

I am not a picky eater. I'm not worried about choking or food textures. I have cravings and love going out to eat and trying new restaurants and new meals. I have even taken up cooking in the last couple of years and get most excited about recipes I can make that MY FAMILY will enjoy…even if I don't really care about eating it myself.

My stomach is grumbling right now. I'm hungry. I've had a protein bar today and that's it. Oh, and some ice cream, but that was unusual.

I will usually just power through this discomfort, drink coffee, and hold out until someone puts food in front of me, or I end up out to eat, or I feel compelled to make food for the family which I will probably have a helping of.

I have no idea why my compulsion to hunger is to ignore it, rather than respond to it, but that's most often what I do.

When I look at a list of common behaviors associated with ARFID most of them don't seem to apply to me, but for some reason, I consistently avoid eating what and when I should, but I can't quite figure out why. It's been suggested to me that's it may be some sort of control thing.

I guess I'm wondering if anybody else is closer to this version? I'm also new here, so this very well might turn out to be a lot more common than I think, and that would be great.",1,1730317094.0,ARFID,6,0.56,False

Today I made a protein smoothie, and the protein powder has 5 grams of sugar apparently, but I didn't want to take it into consideration since I don't have access to easy protein right now and I just needed a compact way to create something to sustain me for the day.
The smoothie is a protein + greens blend, with 1 tbsp of pumpkin seeds protein powder, chia seeds, water, and a bit of stevia. Tastes very chalky and I don't really like it, but I know it's nutrient dense, so it's okay. I also had an espresso + cold brew blend with a splash of whole, grass fed milk (which ordinarily I don't do, since I drink my coffee black, but I'm trying to be casual about my restrictions so long as I'm not binging on sugar) and a bit of stevia, which is okay.

I don't know what I'll have for dinner, if at all, but I do have cottage cheese + half of an avocado with nutritional yeast prepped in advance, as well as a portion of plain, unshelled nuts, and a few blackberries.

I don't really feel any withdrawal symptoms right now, except for the fact that I definitely slept in longer than I should have and I feel very lethargic. 
Additionally, I purchased these throat-numbing sore-throat cough drops for whenever I get cravings for sugar since I figured they could offset any impulsive decisions and also redirect my thoughts so I don't treat them with any sort of urgency, so I will see how that fares.

 Meanwhile, on Reddit, the opposition group is a  flood of disgruntled employees with horror stories of the industry's harshest working conditions. To make matters worse, accounting graduation rates have declined. 

Luckily, the largest accounting firms have formed a coalition against this internet madness. With lobbyists, outsourcing, and investment in A.I. technologies-the partners can thrive. 

Is this the future??  A.I.? India? 

Fortunately, things took a different turn.

2025. After decades of boom. The economy is pinched by rumors of stagflation and war. Accounting layoffs have cut some of the muscle of the firms. Quality is at an all time low. But who cares. As partners, we own the system. 

Tech has popped. Computer science majors have switched to learning accounting. With students loan interest rates at 7%; medical and law school is no longer feasible. Talent is returning and things are stable for now. 

2026. Yes, another accounting scandal has rocked the world. It is clear that nothing will change in the accounting world, except for the shift to remote work. Remote work has saved the industry and graduation rates for that matter. And things will continue as normal. And.. You still need 150 credits. 

2050. Monday morning. An exhausted senior accountant wakes up and walks into his home office wearing pj's. 

""Welp"" he/him says. ""I only have to survive until Thursday."" Yes, in the year 2050, lawmakers have decided on the 4 day work week for all. 

As the senior accountant powers up his work station; he checks to see if his 4 internationally outsourced workers are online, in the meeting, and have cameras on. 

""Once I get my CPA..."" He thinks. ""I can be promoted to controller.. and oversee 20 people.""

""Hmff"" he scoffs. Time to get his/him coffee. 

Beeepppp!!!!

""Oh crap!"" He says. The Vice President of ABC Corp is requesting a video chat. A very important person. Talking to an executive was very important and demanded his best behavior. 

He changes the camera to show his face only because he is wearing pj's. 

""Good morning Mr. Smith."" Said the ai robot. 

This robot oversees 100 people. This robot can fire him for poor performance as well. These robots were introduced about a year ago and were very expensive.
""Mr. Smith. I have decided to create a Performance Improvement Plan (pip) for you. I have noticed that the work is not being turned in in time. Why is that?""

Performance Improvement Plan's were done exclusively by robots.

I love how scents can be subjective and illustrative, and I think there’s something so fun about trying to translate a scent into writing. Some of y’all on here are such good writers! 

That said, I do enjoy the names descriptions in Death & Floral’s catalog… are you kidding with some of those, haha! I want to try everything based on the names alone. I know it’s all part of the marketing, but I appreciate it and it makes it fun.



**FROGS (Death & Floral)**

“Grounding and warm woods, Virgina cedar, cold-pressed yuzu, overgrown moss, forest mushrooms, wet humid frog skin”

I love this. It isn’t as gross as it could be (though I probably would have still liked it). I was expecting a bit more of a dank mildew funk. I’m from the Pacific Northwest and have smelled a lot of wet mossy forests, but this is actually pretty subtle and balanced. Just a well-rounded cozy autumn scent. Someone was asking for a Frog and Toad scent and I’d say this is it totally it, leaning more towards picture book and less actual amphibians.



**Painted Fires (Death & Floral)**

“Dry desert rose & dusty ground, sweet summer citrus, leftover bonfire ash, white safe distilled in New Mexico, sun-warmed ghostly flow”

The sage and desert-y notes really come through, but the citrus ruins it for me. I’m sensitive to what seem like commercial frebreezey bathroom scents and unfortunately citrus can take it to that place for me. Some might be able to find that the citrus brightens the whole profile, but I dunno, lemons don’t fit into the dry desert landscape image for me. It kind of smells like a cute crystal shop that carries sage smudge sticks, but I was hoping for a more outdoorsy desert scent.  
  


**Plain Jane (Death & Floral)**

*“Black Oudh, Fresh morning coffee, rolled tobacco, vegan animal musk, cedar, cinnamon crunch cereal”*

My first impression of this was it was my favorite scent of my order, and then I was a little disappointed that it was called “Plain Jane” because I feel that Death & Floral’s copywriting is so creative and this deserves a more inspired name. It reminds me of an old school coffee shop in my hometown that had saggy couches, punk baristas serving coffee & pastries, smokers on the wraparound porch, students studying all day, shelves of old books and games. It’s a mix of everything in the room—plant, animal, and food. The coffee notes are a lot stronger out of the tube than on my skin.



**People Watching the Dead (Death & Floral)**

*“Spiced Bread and Paprika blended with silk amber”*

I don’t get any of the bread or paprika. I even went into my spice cabinet and huffed the paprika back and forth with this, and I really don’t get it. What I do get is WET WALLS. Damp, sharp, mildewy walls. Which I actually love! Reminds me of the 1890s Victorian farmhouse I lived in in my early 20s that was always damp inside and definitely haunted, but also cozy and just so cool. To me, the name “People Watching the Dead” says it all, it’s the smell of a ghost floating through your bedroom and hiding in the walls. 



**Paw Prints in the Snow (Lucky #9)**

*“Ozone, Icy Fir Frees, Mistletoe, Cranberries, Blackberries”*

This is so fresh and cozy, though it definitely has a Christmassy feel. It’s like Christmas candle meets berry lip gloss, a cute mix of girly and piney. It’s not in your face though, pretty subtle and sweet. I’ll be wearing this on days when I’m feeling more cheerful and in the holiday spirit.  


**Curse of Black Amber (Lucky #9)**

*“Amber, Fir needles, Vanilla, charred cedar wood, Chilly ozone, white musk, bergamot, funeral flowers, tonka beans, and just a dab of patchouli and vetiver.”*

I can’t do patchouli, but thankfully when they say “just a dab” they mean it. The fir needles are very Christmas tree, but with all the other notes it’s giving dark sultry velvet-clad Christmas mistress. I’ll be wearing this winter when I’m feeling like a sexy Scrooge, ruining Christmas by seducing Santa and burning the Christmas tree out back.

Now I’m Trapped in a Nightmare,"I remember the accident like it was yesterday. Unlike many people who say they can’t recall their crashes; I remember every detail of that day. It was winter, and the sun was setting early in the evening. I had gotten off work late; the daylight was now long gone and rain was coming down, making the roads slick, and visibility poor. I was driving my usual route home, thinking about what to pick up for dinner, when it happened. An oncoming truck suddenly swerved into my lane and came straight for me, head-on. In that brief moment, I felt a rush of terror, and a millisecond of clear understanding that I was about to die. Then, everything went black.

I woke up in a hospital room. I heard the beeping of the machines first, followed by the smell of antiseptic. I slowly began to open my eyes to the blinding of fluorescent lights. I heard a machine begin to beep faster, as confusion and panic began to wash over me.

“Woah, easy there”, I heard a voice say.

“You’ve been in an accident. You’re in the hospital, and you’re safe now.”

For a moment, I saw a face next to me. Pretty, and comforting. That was my last thought, before everything went black again.

I’m not sure how much time passed before I woke up again. Feeling more alert this time, I looked around the room, getting a bearing on my surroundings. I knew based on the number of monitors and IVs hooked up to me that I must have been in bad shape. As I blinked against the brightness, a nurse entered, a beacon of warmth in the cold, clinical environment. She had an air of calm that made me feel immediately safe amidst the chaos.

“Hello again, I’m Lily,” she said, her smile softening the edges of my fear. “You passed out before I could introduce myself last time. I’m one of your nurses.” Her kindness radiated as she checked my vitals, her gentle touch igniting a flicker of comfort in me. Day by day, she became my anchor, the one constant in a world that felt hopeless.

As the days stretched into weeks, our conversations grew more personal. I found myself sharing bits of my life, my dreams, and fears, revealing the vulnerable pieces of myself that I rarely showed. Lily listened, her eyes sparkling with empathy, her laughter soothing. I realized I was falling for her, hard.  Her presence in my recovery brightened my days and made me forget the pain.

The more time we spent together, the more I felt a sense of normalcy return to my life. During a particularly quiet evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting my hospital room in hues of orange and pink, I knew I had fallen in love with her. She had just finished her shift and came to check on me before leaving. Her hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail, the tiredness in her eyes overshadowed by the warmth of her smile.

Feeling bold, I asked “So, when I get out of here, can I take you to dinner?”

She smiled, leaning against the doorframe. “Yes, I’d love that”, her face blushing.

In that moment, I felt a connection between us, something electric that pulsed in the air.

After another couple weeks of healing, I was finally discharged. I sat outside the hospital, the sun warming my skin, a stark contrast to the cold sterility I had grown accustomed to. I kept my word to Lily, taking her out for dinner a few days later. And the rest, as they say, was history.

We began to explore the possibility of a life together. We found the perfect little house on the outskirts of town; its white picket fence a picture of domestic bliss. It felt like a dream. The house was modest, but was a fresh start, a blank canvas on which we could build our lives together. We spent countless hours painting the walls, arranging furniture, and filling the space with our personalities.

As we settled into our new life, I couldn’t have been happier. Lily was everything I had ever wanted, kind, intelligent, and fiercely supportive. It was as if the universe had conspired to bring us together, and for the first time in a long while, I felt a sense of belonging. I felt thankful for the crash that brought her to me.

Months passed, and we only grew closer. We shared dreams of starting a family and growing old together in that cozy little home. We’d sit on the porch, watching the sunset, discussing our plans and laughing at inside jokes. But over time, something started to change in that house. Something started to change in Lily.

It started as small things. Objects would get misplaced; the trashcan would be knocked over. Lily and I would tease each other for being forgetful, each of us assuming it was the other.  But then things began to happen that I knew couldn’t have been her.

One night, while cooking dinner, I got the milk out of the refrigerator, and set it on the counter. When I turned back around, it was gone, back in the refrigerator. Doors would creak open, the TV would change channels by itself. I began to feel uneasy in the house, like I was being watched. One night, while sitting on the couch, I brought the topic up to Lily.

“Do you ever feel... strange in this house? Like you’re being watched?” I asked.

“No, not at all... are you being serious?” She replied.

“Oh come-on, you mean to tell me you’ve never thought it's weird that things move around on their own all the time, how our stuff always gets misplaced? You’ve never heard the doors opening and shutting by themselves?” I said.

“Hallucinations are normal after a bad injury. Maybe we need to go get you checked out”. Lily said.

Her dismissiveness touched my nerves. “I’m not hallucina – “

“I think you should just let it go” she interrupted.

Her cold response caught me off guard, and for the first time, I felt a rift between us.

That night, I laid in bed, staring up at the ceiling, replaying the conversation I’d had with Lily earlier. It wasn’t even a real fight, but it lingered in my mind. Lately, it had started to feel like we were both on edge, with something unspoken weighing between us. And it wasn’t just that conversation; it was everything in this house. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, that I was being watched, even now. I closed my eyes, willing myself to ignore the sense of dread, trying to drift off. But just as I felt myself slipping toward sleep, I heard it. A voice, close and quiet, whispering my name. “David”. It wasn’t Lily’s voice. It was urgent, almost pleading, as though someone was right there in the room with me, waiting for me to respond.

I jolted upright, heart pounding as I looked around the room, trying to find the source of the whisper. I strained my ears, waiting to hear it again. But there was nothing, just the sound of my own heavy breathing. I turned and saw Lily beside me, fast asleep, her breathing slow and steady. She looked peaceful, completely undisturbed. I tried to tell myself I’d imagined it, just a product of my own frayed nerves and lack of sleep. But as I lay back down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had been there, close enough to whisper right into my ear.

I woke up the next morning, more on edge than ever after my experience the night before. But Lily was in good spirits, and her kind and fun personality was contagious, bringing me out of my slump. And for the next few days, things seemed to settle down. No strange noises, no objects moving, just quiet nights and a gradual return to normalcy. I started to feel more like myself, and I wondered if maybe it had all been my imagination. Stress from moving, adjusting to a new life together, recovering after my injuries, nothing more. We’d started laughing together again, our conversations and routines falling back into place.

The strangeness of the house all but completely left my mind, when one afternoon, I was in the shower. I heard the bathroom door slowly open, and I could hear someone come in, their footsteps quiet but distinct. Through the steamy curtain, I could see the shadow of a figure approaching the shower and standing right outside, just lingering there. I waited for a second, waiting to hear Lily speak or open the curtain, but the figure just stood outside of the shower. I grinned, calling out to Lily, “Oh, coming to join me, huh?”

I opened the curtain to peek, only to find no one was there. The door was closed, as if no one had entered at all.

A chill crawled up my spine. I jumped out of the shower, quickly wrapping myself in a towel, and hurried into the living room. I found Lily on the couch, casually watching TV, completely at ease. “Oh yeah, very funny,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

She glanced up, confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Coming into the bathroom while I was in the shower,” I said, feeling a prickle of annoyance. “Were you just standing there to freak me out?”

Lily’s face hardened. “I didn’t go in there, David. And honestly, this… this stuff you keep bringing up? The whispers, stuff moving… It’s getting old.”

“Old? You think I’m making it up?”

“Yes! I don’t know what’s going on with you, but you need to let all this go. None of it is real. Just let it go and focus on us, on our life together. I’m sick of hearing about it.”

Her reaction stung. I hadn’t seen her that frustrated before, and as we argued, a tension settled between us. It was our first real argument, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something much deeper was happening.

That night, after lying awake, I finally drifted off to sleep, hoping things would settle in the morning. I finally fell asleep, only to wake up to the feeling of eyes on me. In the darkness, I could make out a figure standing next to the bed, staring down at me. It was Lily’s figure. Her face was covered in shadow, but I could hear her lips moving, whispering something just out of earshot. My heart pounded as I reached out, my voice barely a whisper. “Lily? What… what are you doing? What’s wrong?”

She didn’t answer. She continued to whisper, quiet and unsettling, and I felt a deep, crawling fear sink into my bones. The whispering grew faster, more urgently. Fumbling, I reached over and switched on the bedside lamp. Light flooded the room, and my heart nearly stopped when I realized Lily was lying next to me, fast asleep. No one else was there. The room was empty, silent, except for the faint sound of her breathing. There was no one next to my bed, no one whispering.

In the days that followed, a wall seemed to build between Lily and me. She grew colder, barely acknowledging me with anything more than a nod or a short answer. Her once warm smile and playful remarks were replaced with a distant, almost vacant expression. Every time I tried to break through, I felt like I was talking to a stranger.

Meanwhile, the strange events increased around the house, now not only in the dead of night but now in broad daylight. Shadows seemed to flicker at the edges of my vision, slipping away whenever I tried to look directly. And the whispers, the same unsettling, faint voices I had once heard only at night, now crept into my waking hours. They’d drift in and out, low and unintelligible, just enough to put my nerves on edge. Objects seemed to be shifting around, too. I’d leave my keys on the counter, only to find them on the coffee table moments later. Kitchen drawers would be rearranged; what was once our cutlery drawer became our junk drawer. What was once our plate cabinet became our Tupperware cabinet. I felt as the house itself was subtly working against me, trying to drive me insane.

Every strange thing left me more anxious, questioning my own sanity. Was I imagining things? I started doubting myself, my sanity, until, one afternoon, I heard it again, my name, whispered clear, and close. I spun around, expecting to find an empty room, but instead, I caught a glimpse of Lily’s face just before she darted out of sight, slipping around the corner of the hallway. My stomach twisted, and a wave of nausea hit me. What the hell was she doing, hiding around the corner and whispering my name?

I found her in the kitchen, casually chopping vegetables as though nothing had happened. “Lily,” I said, my voice strained. “What were you just doing?”

She looked up, feigning innocence. “What do you mean?”

“I just… saw you,” I stammered, trying to keep my voice steady. “You were whispering my name… hiding around the corner.”

She stared at me, a hint of amusement flickering in her eyes, but her expression was empty of any warmth. “Oh, David,” she said in a low, almost mocking tone. “I think you’re seeing things.”

Her words hung in the air, cold and dismissive, sending a chill down my spine. The way she looked at me, almost taunting, made my skin crawl. I opened my mouth to argue, to ask her why she was acting like this, but the look on her face stopped me. There was something so… unsettling in her gaze, like she was holding back something dark. As I turned and walked out of the kitchen, I could’ve sworn I heard a faint laugh come from her.

A new fear emerged in me. A feeling that somehow, just maybe, Lily had something to do with all the strange things happening around the house.

I tried to convince myself that maybe it wasn’t Lily; maybe there was something about the house itself that was warping her behavior. It was the only thing that made sense. She’d never acted this way before. She most definitely was not acting like the same person I had fallen in love with. I was determined to get answers.

I began by looking through the home’s deed and ownership history. Late at night, I sat at my computer, combing through property records. I found every sale, every name tied to the house. Oddly, it was short, a few owners here and there, but no gaps or missing entries. Every person who’d lived here had sold and left within a handful of years, but the reasons were normal. Nothing I found hinted at anything dark. No one had died in the house, nothing.

The house wasn’t especially old, either. It was built in the 1980s, with nothing more than a couple of renovations over the years. I started thinking maybe the land held some kind of dark secret, so I checked historical records. I combed through old property maps and records of ownership before the house was built, but all I saw was bland suburban history. The land had been nothing but an empty field and a minor farmland a century ago. No battle sites, no cemeteries, no tragedies marked on record. It seemed impossible that there was nothing here, nothing unusual to explain what I had been experiencing.

Growing desperate, I went to the library, combing through archived newspapers and town records. I looked for articles about the neighborhood, hoping for some small hint: a tragedy in a neighboring house, an unexplained death, anything. But all I could find were the usual town tidbits. A mayoral election, a local high school sports game, maybe a yard sale advertised on an old flyer.

I started diving into forums and paranormal sites late at night, reading stories about hauntings and researching symptoms and causes of cursed houses. I searched the house for any strange artifacts hidden in the crawlspace, looking for any ritual markings carved in the wood. I had even hired a professional while Lily was at work to do x-ray and ultrasound mapping of the walls and yard to find anything that may be hidden, body or otherwise. But again, nothing.

It felt like I was going mad. I’d poured over every lead, every scrap of information, and still, I had nothing to explain what was happening. And that’s when the doubt set in. Maybe it really was just my imagination. Maybe I had a lingering head injury from my crash. The lack of evidence left me with nothing but that answer. One evening, I sat Lily down and admitted to her that I thought I might be losing it. I was embarrassed, vulnerable, but she listened, patient and empathetic. She suggested seeing a psychologist and mentioned one she knew who did house calls.

The psychologist came by a few days later. He was calm and reassuring, his voice low and steady as we spoke in the living room. He asked about my sleep, stress levels, and any major life changes. I found myself unloading everything, the strange occurrences, Lily’s unsettling behavior, even the bizarre visions. He listened without judgment and offered to prescribe me some medication to ease my anxiety. I was hesitant, but out of desperation, I agreed to give it a try.

For a time, it seemed to work. I felt more grounded. The strange events faded into the background, and Lily seemed more herself, warm and easygoing, like she used to be. I felt like I could finally breathe, reassured that it all really had been my mind playing tricks on me. Life slowly crept back to normal, and I was relieved to think I’d found a solution. But as the days went on, things began to shift again, subtly at first.

One morning, I woke up and made my way down the hallway toward the kitchen, still drowsy and rubbing my eyes. As I approached, I heard low voices, Lily’s, unmistakably, but with a murmur that sounded like a man’s voice replying. I froze just outside the door, trying to make out the words, but they were muffled, secretive. I turned the corner, but Lily snapped back to cooking breakfast, alone at the stove as though nothing had happened.

“Who the hell were you just talking to?” I asked, my voice sounding a little too accusatory.

She shrugged. “I was just talking to myself. What’s wrong with you?”

The suspicion bubbled up again, more intense than ever. I didn’t press further, but from that day on, my trust in her began to fracture. I stopped taking the medication, hoping that it might sharpen my senses again. I began to feel it again, something dark and wrong within the house, and with Lily. I began to question if I should leave.

On my last day in the house, I was carrying a load of laundry down the hall, when something caught the corner of my eye in the bathroom. I thought I saw a reflection the mirror. *Maybe it's Lily behind the door, trying to scare me*, I thought. 

I paused, shifting the pile of clothes in my arms and backed up, peering inside. In the dim light of the mirror, I saw a reflection. There, standing just behind the half shut door, was a mangled figure. Its face was contorted, flesh torn and bruised, eyes vacant but fixed directly on me. Blood seeped down its jaw, dripping onto a chest split open and raw. I couldn’t look away, couldn’t even breathe.

Then, in a hoarse, deep voice, it said my name: “David…”

The clothes tumbled from my arms as I stumbled backward, my heart hammering. A scream ripped through me, loud and desperate, and then Lily rushed in, flipping on the hallway light.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” she demanded, her voice sharp. I pointed desperately toward the bathroom. The bathroom was empty, and the mirror was clear, but I couldn’t shake the image. I tried to explain, but she waved it off, her face tight with irritation. She seemed so cold, so detached, almost as if she were an entirely different person.

In that moment, something in me broke. I felt the hot sting of tears as I looked at Lily, really looked at her, and saw how empty she seemed. I could barely keep my voice steady.

“Lily… what happened to you? Why are you acting like this?” My voice cracked, a desperate plea. “What are you hiding from me? I know what I saw… I know what I’ve been hearing. And I think… I think you know it too.”

She looked at me, her expression unreadable, but something shifted in her eyes, something dark, cold, almost mocking. She tilted her head just slightly, her lips curling into a slow, unsettling smile.

“David,” she said, her voice low and eerily calm. “You’re just so tired… Why don’t you just rest? Stop worrying so much.”

 A chill ran down my spine, and goosebumps rose in my skin. In that moment, I knew I had to leave, to get as far away from her and the house as possible.

 That night, as I got in bed, I made up my mind. First thing in the morning, I would pack my things, find a hotel, and leave without looking back. I closed my eyes, forcing myself to sleep, but the unease gnawed at me, twisting knots of fear into my chest. But I also felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me, and I quickly drifted off to sleep.

Sometime in the middle of the night, a whisper broke the silence.

“David”

My eyes snapped open, heart pounding. The voice was right next to my ear, soft but insistent. I turned slowly and saw a shadowy figure by the bedside, hovering close. It was Lily again. Her head pointed down toward me, the rest of her figure outlined in the darkness.

Terrified, I quickly I reached over and desperately felt for the bedside lamp, flicking it on, I expected the figure to vanish as it always did. But it didn’t. Not this time. She was still standing there, staring, eyes wide and unblinking, her lips moving ever so slightly, whispering my name, “David… Daaaaviiiiiiid…”

My breath caught in my throat as I realized she wasn’t alone. Behind her, fully visible in the light, was the figure from the bathroom mirror, the mangled, bloodied apparition, its face a grotesque mask of agony and violence. Its eyes were hollow, yet I felt its gaze pierce right through me.

As I froze, paralyzed with terror, Lily leaned closer, still whispering, “Stay with us, David… stay with us…” Her voice grew softer, blending into a low, raspy tone that sounded distinctly wrong, too deep, almost inhuman. “Stay with me, David…”

The figure behind her moved, body crunching and contorting as it stepped closer. Lily’s voice morphed further, deepening into a man’s voice, repeating the words like a chant, “Stay with us, David… Stay with me… come on... stay with me”

I clutched the sheets, my heart pounding so loudly it drowned out the horrible voices in the room. I was frozen. I couldn't move. I couldn't scream.

My bedside lamp began to grow brighter, and I heard the bulb began to ring. Lily and the figure got closer, both now reaching out toward me in unison.

The room began to fall apart as the light grew brighter. The ringing of the lightbulb now turned into something else, like a rhythmic beeping. I felt like I was being pulled, and felt a flash of extreme pain.

“Stay with us, David, stay with us.” I opened my eyes weakly to the sight of lights flashing by, bright, and blinding. I felt a seer of pain and faces surrounding me and I was being rushed down a hallway, with a male doctor repeating the phrase to me. Everything went black again.

After some time, I woke up, finding myself in a hospital room with a doctor standing by my bed.

“Hello there, welcome back, we almost lost you.”

“Wha… what happened, where am I?” I managed to get out.

“You were in a car accident, truck hit you head-on. Damn son, you’re lucky to be alive. You’ve been in surgery and you’re stable now. You’re going to be alright. Go ahead and get some rest.” The doctor said.

“Where… where’s Lily?” I asked him.

“Is Lily a family member? Would you like us to call her?” he replied.

“She’s a nurse here, she’s... she's my girlfriend”

“No nurses named Lily here. Get some rest, you’re going to need it for your recovery.”

Over the following weeks, doctors and psychologists worked with me to put together the pieces. They explained that my brain had tried to shield me from the trauma of the accident and coma by creating an elaborate world to cope with the void. The term they used was “maladaptive daydreaming,” and something called “post-traumatic confabulation,” where the brain fills in gaps with constructed realities; places, people, entire lives, to help make sense of the trauma. They told me it was common for coma patients to create people or worlds in their minds, to anchor themselves to some form of reality, even if it was a fabrication. In my case, the creation was Lily. My brain had then constructed an antagonist, the house, the paranormal events, in an attempt to pull me back out.

At first, the revelations hit me like a physical blow. I felt the ground fall out beneath me, leaving only emptiness where she had been. I hadn’t just lost Lily; I’d lost the life we’d built, the home we’d created, the future I thought was waiting for us. No matter how terrifying things became in the end, there was a life there that felt real, a purpose, a love.

It has been 2 years since then. I have begun to rebuild my life, but the weight of that loss still clings to me, silent and unyielding. Friends and family urge me to move on, but I feel tethered to something that no one else can see. Every time I’d try to meet someone new, I’d feel the ghost of Lily beside me. Even though she wasn’t real, nothing could match the love I felt with her. That connection, imagined as it was, left a mark that no reality can seem to replace.

One doctor called it a “phantom limb” of the heart. The absence of her is something I feel as clearly as if she’d truly been there. Despite knowing she was never real, I still find myself longing for the love I’d had with her, even down to the fear, the mystery, the strange events. It was all something real to me. I still dream of her sometimes, her face still as clear as when I had known her. In my dreams, I’m back in our house, during those first few months when everything was perfect. And I always wake up, finding myself back here.

My thought was to bring a little humor and announce that we’re doing a special Secret Lives of the _____ Wives asting call and talk about what we’re looking for. 

For example, I’d say something like,”First, I want clarify that the only type of swinging that will be going on is when we take our kids to the playground…”

Tongue in cheek stuff like that, gossiping/coffee/soda/alcohol, consumption, hair, extensions, Botox, fillers…

Some good one liners and zingers and make people laugh because obviously it’s a fake casting call.

I went to Costco yesterday and was on the lookout for easy, nutritious foods that aren't just my go to sugar fuel. In the refrigerated section they had a box of cheese, fruit and nut packs which taste great. In the snack section I got some beef sticks for snacking on, and I'm planning on bagging them for lunches. For breakfast and snacks I like to make sandwiches - I use croissant loaf bread from Kroger, ham or turkey (Costco has a 3 pack of sliced turkey so I put two of them in the freezer) and cheese, plus some mayo. I microwave it and then put it in tin foil and take it to work in the morning. Costco also has chicken sausages, which I also got a 3 pack and then put two in the freezer. Costco has a 3 pack of Oregon chai that I can use to go to coffee shops less often (which is also why I have a Nespresso vertuo). At Kroger today I got some cream cheese to add to my sandwiches, skim milk for my lattes, bell peppers to cut up and dip in ranch, and Greek yogurt and frozen fruit for smoothies. 👌🏼",10,1730316378.0,adhdwomen,4,0.92,False

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBlqFucMfiq/

I’m blown away by how much coffee is stuck in this commercial-grade grinder, especially since they claim to clean it once a week.

Does this seem like a typical amount of retention for a week?

I know commercial grinders have high retention, but it looks like the chute is almost completely blocked by baked-in coffee, so it’s not just a retention issue.

Maybe it’s specific to this grinder model, which I’ve never heard of:

1gfuu7w,https://i.redd.it/np5d4iuy1yxd1.jpeg,Is @tok_savings on Insta legit or just milking donations (Scamming?) ,"

Hey everyone, I’ve been following **@tok_savings** on TikTok, where he shares these ultra-low-budget meal videos for his ""kids."" He claims to make their lunches for around £1-2, maxing out at about £7 for everything. It’s an interesting concept, but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s off.

He’s received a ton of donations—around **$1,750** on Buy Me a Coffee alone (349 donations at $5 each) and probably more through PayPal. Yet, despite this significant income, his budget hasn’t budged. He still acts like he’s only spending a couple of pounds, which feels misleading if people are donating to help him out.

His kitchen is always a mess, too. It almost seems like he’s keeping it dirty on purpose to play up the “struggling parent” narrative. Sure, everyone has different standards, but it looks like he’s using this setting to tug at viewers’ heartstrings, likely to boost engagement. If he’s pulling in steady donations, why not clean up a bit?

And honestly, I’m starting to wonder if he even has kids. He never shows them in his videos; it’s just him and the food. If he’s collecting donations for “feeding his kids,” wouldn’t it make sense to include them? 

It feels like he’s playing up this struggling-dad persona just to rake in donations. Has anyone else noticed this, or am I just reading too much into it?

1gfutu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1gfutu3/a_flicker_in_the_dark/,A Flicker in the Dark,"Jeff sat alone in his tiny, dim apartment, illuminated only by the faint, fading light slipping through the grimy window. The power had gone out again. That was just how things were now—power came and went in the crumbling city blocks, where the fortunate few who had shelter considered it a small victory over the endless street-level crowds begging for food, warmth, and a place to rest.

Despite the gloomy chill of his dark apartment, Jeff counted himself lucky. He had four walls, a door, and even, on occasion, electricity. Still, tonight felt particularly dismal. With nothing to do but wait, he idly watched the street below, eyes drifting over the gaunt figures huddled on the sidewalk. Among the usual faces, something caught his eye: across the street, his friend’s apartment was lit up with a warm glow, as if the power outage hadn’t affected it at all.

A flicker of hope stirred in Jeff. Maybe tonight wouldn’t be so bleak after all.

Moments later, he stood knocking on his friend’s door, and it opened to reveal a warmly lit, almost inviting space. The old, tattered furniture might have been dusty and worn, but it was solid, and stable—a rare comfort. Jeff took a seat and allowed himself to relax into the cushions, which smelled faintly of dust and old wood.

""Got lucky with the power,"" his friend remarked, handing Jeff a cup of some hot, bitter concoction. They both knew it wasn’t coffee, but it was warm, and right now, that was enough.

On the battered television, a commercial flickered to life, playing just above the murmur of the city outside. A catchy jingle floated from the screen: *""Momma’s Foods—Always here for you, one bite at a time!""* A smiling family in bright colors sat at a table laden with food, steam curling up from a perfect pot roast, complete with glistening vegetables and rich, savory gravy. The commercial cut to a scene of fields of grain and happy workers in clean uniforms, cheerful music playing as they harvested abundant crops.

Jeff snorted. “Wonder what that’s really made of?”

His friend shrugged. “It tastes like pot roast. That’s enough for most folks.”

The ad rolled on, its tones syrupy and sweet, like something from another era. Jeff shifted in his seat, trying to ignore the discomfort that prickled at his neck. The comforting images of family dinners and feasts seemed hollow here in this room, in this city where food, any food, was a rare commodity.

They chatted in subdued tones, discussing their usual topics: the rise in missing persons around the neighborhood, the questionable quality of the food supply, and the feeling that everything was crumbling faster than anyone wanted to admit. But tonight, even those topics felt too far removed to worry about. They’d talked about this plenty before; they both figured it was just another piece of life they couldn’t control.

“Eh,” Jeff’s friend said, waving off the topic, “folks come and go. That’s life.”

The room settled into silence, broken only by the hum of the commercial’s final tagline, echoing as if from far away: *""Momma’s Foods—Bringing families together, nourishing the world.""* The screen cut to black, and a chill seemed to seep into the room.

Jeff finished his drink, sighed, and glanced back out the window. The crowd below seemed to throb and move in unison, like a single, breathing entity. Hunger, desperation, and shadows filled the street. As he looked at the dark, shivering figures below, he wondered, just for a second, how many of them would be here tomorrow.

But he quickly pushed the thought away. There was no point in worrying over things he couldn’t change.",1,1730316018.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

I HAD A STRANGER COMPLIMENT ME ON MY SOCIAL SKILLS. I just have to tell you 😭,"So, this summer I had horrible ND burnout. And I realized that a big part of it was due to pure exhaustion from being an EXTREMELY high masking person for all of my life. So, since the summer I've been practicing really hard on ""unmasking"". And I'm realizing that I'm not as shy and socially anxious as I used to think I was, because I'm no longer scared of being judged for being ""weird"" or ""eccentric"" or any of the other things that can come along with autism/ADHD. 

So today I went in to the coffee shop down the street from work, which I frequent. The guy at the counter asked for my name for my order - and then mentioned that he sees me in a lot. So I asked him for his name as well and said nice to meet you. And then there was a second barista and as she was making my drink I said ""I see you all the time working in here as well, what is your name?"" And she told me and then said it was nice to meet me, and asked me a little about the place I work and chatted for a moment, I complimented her hair.

Nothing too special (well, it is, but I have been practicing talking to strangers as part of my unmasking for months, and so it is starting to feel very natural) but it felt good doing that. But then, there was a woman in her 30s/40s standing near me also waiting for her drink. And she turned to me and went ""Sorry if this is weird, but I really admire that interaction you just did! I have no idea how to navigate small talk, and I never think to ask people for their names. Like you just introduced yourself because you see them often, and that is so nice and just makes sense. I really would like to do that more, but I just never know how to approach the situation. So thanks for giving me some inspiration today""

I swear it sounds like I'm making this up or something. I never thought in my life that would happen to me. Idk I just feel so proud. Unmasking therapy is the best thing I've ever done for myself and for literal strangers to recognize the inner work I've been doing and compliment me and say I gave them ""inspiration"" is just never something I thought would happen. I can genuinely say I'm starting to like myself a lot just being my literal unmasked self, and other people are noticing too. It is completely amazing and I felt something in my brain shift to pure joy and pride. Thanks for letting me share!",67,1730315798.0,AutismInWomen,6,0.98,False

1gfumt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gfumt3/aitah/,AITAH,"Years ago my in-laws moved out west to a home near the mountains they often asked that I and family move there as well. Spouses health issues and finances would not allow this so we stayed in our home state and would visit with them anytime they came back to the area. After my spouse passed his parents again persisted in asking for me to move by them. I had enough saved to afford the move and had employment that would allow this as well. In part to see them more and because I had also always wanted to live near the mountains I picked up and moved my family 1100 miles to be closer to them. 
My job does have me working a lot of hours sometimes as much as 60per week and I work 12-16hr shifts so I don't always have time to go out and frequently offers to have lunch or coffee are turned down because schedules conflict. That aside I have given permission for my in-laws to see their grandchildren whenever their isn't a conflict they would just need to pick them up (we live about 18miles away) this is mainly because they usually ask to see them when I am working and I cannot just leave work to drop them off. My In-laws shortly after I moved decided that they are going to move back to our home state and hinted that they want me to as well. My children are happy and thriving and I'd be returning to a place with no job and no place to live so I have obviously said no. They are pressing the issue that I should let them see their grandchild more which I said was fine. Arrangements were made I presumed they would be picking them up as was normal. I got home and they had not done so, I assumed something came up and they canceled. I then get awoken early the following morning on one of my few days off to being bombarded with texts and calls from sisters-in-law demanding to know what is going on with their niece and why I am refusing parent in laws time with their grandchild. Completely confused I tell them their niece is fine and that in-laws didn't come to pick them up. I am then told I was supposed to drop them off at in-laws to which I replied I was working and if I'd known that was the expectation I would have rescheduled. I also was frustrated as to why this had to be blasted to everyone versus just a simple call or text to me for resolution. I after responding to all the angry texts and calls I tried to call parent in law only to have call go to voicemail so I sent a text stating that I felt their behavior regarding the concern was disappointing. I also made sure to tell them that they could still see their grandchild but would need to pick them up. I was told in reply I was being mean and needed to accommodate them by dropping off since they were doing so much to prepare house for sale and packing. I have not replied and they have not tried to reach out since but I feel like maybe I am in the wrong for holding them to the original agreement that they pick up child given my work schedule.

1gfum0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/trektalk/comments/1gfum0z/opinion_den_of_geek_star_trek_strange_new_worlds/,"[Opinion] DEN OF GEEK: ""Star Trek Strange New Worlds Season 3 Just Quietly Upgraded a Character with a TOS Twist"" | ""We’re talking about Jenna Mitchell, played by Rong Fu, who plays a pivotal role in saving the day in Strange New Worlds, even though she’s not a “main” character.""","DEN OF GEEK:

""Curiously, the name “Mitchell” should also sound familiar to Original Series fans. The overall point of the new SNW season 3 clip is to show that the Enterprise crew is frantic for solutions as the Gorn are closing in. This is a classic Captain Pike command-style decision, asking everyone for input before making a dangerous call. 

The Next Generation fans will find this frantic technobabble spitball session familiar, and there are even aspects of it that are reminiscent of the TNG classic “Cause and Effect.” But, what’s interesting here is that Jenna Mitchell (Fu)—who is at the ops/navigation station, next to Number One (Rebecca Romijn) at the helm—is the one who comes up with the answer. The Enterprise has to tag the Gorn ship, but they need to disguise the tracker as something else. So, Mitchell suggests using a dud photon torpedo, an attack that is really a way of tagging the Gorn ship.

This gambit works, and the Enterprise lives to fight another day, plus, it now has a way to track their missing comrades. We don’t know what happens next, but interestingly, this scene wouldn’t have worked without Mitchell’s quick thinking. And this isn’t the first time this character has been pivotal in Strange New Worlds.

In the season 2 premiere, “The Broken Circle,” Mitchell is part of a very small inner circle of officers—including Uhura, Chapel, and M’Benga—who all conspire with Spock to steal the Enterprise. It was Mitchell who faked the coolant leak that allowed the Enterprise to have a legitimate reason to leave spacedock. In another episode later that season, she’s the one helping Spock try to make Klingon coffee, raktajino. Mitchell was also transformed into a Crimson Guard character during the storybook effect in season 1’s  “The Elysian Kingdom.”

The point is, in many of the big episodes of SNW, Mitchell has been right there, even though she’s not a main character. But maybe she lowkey is a main character?

[...]

To put it another way, Mitchell is the latest example of an interesting Star Trek tradition: Continuing to feature a secondary “background character” and continuing to give that person important jobs to do on the ship, which creates a veneer of realism. Not every single crew member can be on duty 24/7, which means the relief officers, like Mitchell, would be on the bridge all the time. TNG was pretty good about this too, often rotating out helm and ops officers for a degree of realism. But, with her latest quick-thinking, you have to wonder if Mitchell isn’t suddenly going to be promoted to a full-time cast member by season 4.

1gfuly6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1gfuly6/whats_the_best_way_for_me_to_help_here/,What’s the best way for me to help here?,"My wife (37F)  and I (37) have three children 5,3,4 months.  My wife is a SAHM and is still very much feeling some postpartum issues. She still wakes up several times a night to nurse, the baby,  so she is definitely not getting as much sleep as she’d like. I am fortunate enough to be able to let her sleep until 10 AM most days (I let her sleep til she gets wakes up on the weekend. Often as late as noon) as I often work from home. I do everything around the house: I cook all the meals, clean all the dishes, usually give the kids their baths, do all the grocery shopping (where I take the kids with me to give her some alone time).  

My wife is still very much depressed and extremely insecure about the weight she has gained since having children.  Before kids, she definitely was in great shape as she did CrossFit and ate well, and she is always saying how she can’t wait to start losing weight once the baby sleeps a little bit better. I actually do understand where she’s coming from here.  We are definitely in a tough season. 

 This Christmas will be the first time that every single person in my family, including spouses and kids will be together.  We really aren’t sure when this will happen again. My sister asked if we’d want to all get “dolled up” for a family picture, and my wife almost lost it. She said she doesnt want to take the picture because everyone is going to think of how fat she is.  She’s not nearly as big as she thinks she is, but my family are all in great shape, as we stay active and limit crap. So she is even more insecure for this reason.  She sent me a screenshot of a conversation with her best friend explaining how she doesn’t want to be in the picture, and her friend (who is always a victim enabler) said my family is clearly overstepping my wife’s boundaries.  

Since this baby was born,  I have offered to meal prep for her, take over nighttime feedings, ( baby really doesn’t take a bottle, but I have offered to Rock him when he’s not actually nursing so she can go back to sleep) and she will not let me. I give her a minimum two hours a day to herself, which should be used for whatever she wants to do, but she rarely does anything that would actually help her.  She often says she wants to start working out, but she usually just sits on the couch (which she has done all day) and eats potato chips and drinks wine to help her with her stress.  I have often suggested going for walks during the day and for her alone time, as it will help her. She gets really frustrated with me when I suggest that. I have typically bit my tongue about this issue until Christmas picture came up.  The boundaries thing just opened up a box with me. Her friend is extremely unhappily married, and literally has nothing in life that my wife and I want. 

I am beyond frustrated, because all she does is sit inside all day.  My wife never even goes as far as the park with the kids. She never goes on walks, and there are days on end where she does not even see sunlight. She just sits inside and holds the baby. She usually only leaves the house once a week to take the girls to gymnastics, and that is after I have gotten them completely ready to go, made my wife coffee to go, and have to wake her up to drive them there as I work. I get really frustrated knowing all the efforts and offers I have made to help her, yet she is refusing to change anything. The fact that me, the working dad (yes I work from home, but I am also at least 50% of the time seeing customers) am the one who takes the kids to the park 9/10 times. 

I am not saying this  to complain about my wife. I am choosing to love her during this difficult time.  I also know that me doing all of the things to help her seems like enabling, but it’s only been like this the last few months with the baby. 
I am just curious what I could actually do to help her here. I know this is not my wife. This is a postpartum and sleepless version of my wife.  But a version I’m worried will never change. I have never really let this bother me, until she reached out to the victim, enabling friend who said that my family is overstepping their boundaries by wanting to take a photo together. I am surprised and proud of how well I actually didn’t lose my shit in that moment, but internally this is really messing with me. Obviously it’s about more than a he Christmas picture, but It’s been a few days, and I’m still frustrated just thinking about it.  I will do everything necessary before even considering leaving her, but this thought had never once hit me until now. I’m so fucking mad, but really think I need to get her some professional help (which she is too stubborn to seek at the moment). 

 Does anyone have any good suggestions on how I can help her take responsibility and stop living like she is?  Or is this just a post partum thing I need to be patient with?
I really want to believe that life is going to get better when she starts sleeping and  her hormones balance out, but I honestly have some serious doubts.  ",1,1730315450.0,Postpartum_Depression,2,1.0,False

1gfulpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1gfulpv/online_dating_in_a_small_town_400_people/,Online Dating in a Small Town (400 people),"In December of 2023, I was working at the local grocery store when someone new walked in. This town is so small that you'll know when you see someone unfamiliar. She asked me about getting a job so I gave her contact info to the boss. We only have one store and a gas station here.

In February 2024, I was swiping through FB dating and found this same person, who lives in this tiny village of 400 people. Without any foresight, I swiped and sent a message reaching out, mentioning that I saw her in December.

Over the next couple of weeks, we hit it off. The chemistry was strong, and we spent hours on the phone... Our first call being 6 hours of talking and then falling asleep on each other. We shared our life stories and some of our deepest darkest secrets. It was a connection with lots of laughter, and someone who didn't care if I don't always have something to say, which is an issue for me with anyone I talk to. Things got sexual pretty quickly, and got dirty on the phone and on snap.

Early on, we had a talk about religion. Although we both really liked each other alot, she is a Christian and I am spiritual, so we agreed that it couldn't be anything serious, and we were friends with benefits but I emphasize the friends part. 

I was busy with school so we didn't hangout until a week and a half after talking online, but I would see her come into the store and we'd talk there in the meantime, also hugging. As for the first date, I was really awkward and timid, but we also smoked weed and made out. She brought drinks over but we didn't drink, soon after saying she had to go to a doctors appointment in a couple hours. We went for a walk and I didn't have the confidence to say anything bold, but I'd look over at her out of attraction but didn't own up to it, I brushed it off as nothing. It was awkward but it didn't kill the connection then and there. She hugged me before she left.

That same day, I had talked with her briefly, and asked how I was doing. Perhaps the straw that killed the camels back was when she asked how I was doing and said I was frustrated with math homework. No response after that. I quickly realized what I did and the next morning sent a message saying that ""I hope your dreams were as wonderful as mine"". She opened it at the end of the day and never responded. We had talked all day every day up until this point

A couple of days later, I sent a text through SMS saying that I unadded her thinking she had lost interest, but admitted that I may have made a mistake on my part and wanted to fix my mistake, saying I valued our friendship. Otherwise to feel free to regard the text and I'd leave her alone, going on to say thank you for our friendship and I hope she and her family do well. I never heard back. This was in the end of February.

But the story doesn't end here...

I continued to work at the store, and soon took a break from college and got more hours to save up for a car over the next six months, starting in April. It was a few weeks before I would begin to see her come into the store again, which became a regular thing once every week or two. 

Over the next few months, she would come in regularly. It was silence for a while, but then in May, she did try to say hi to me once. I ignored her. Then a few days later, she came in and said ""hi guys"" to me and another coworker. I ignored her again and walked off. Same thing when she left. Out of the corner of my eye, I would see her look over at me on multiple occasions, but no words exchanged. She came to my register one day but it was business as usual with minimal small talk. One day I was joking around with my coworkers while she was there and once I stirred up laughter with them, she looked at me for a good few seconds, but I again ignored her.

Over the next few months, it was silence. But every time it would hurt. Admittedly, I missed her so much but I didn't want to show it, acting unfased when she would talk to me or look at me. One time I accidentally looked over at her, thinking it was another customer, waiting for them to walk by. She anxiously said hi, and I said ""sorry"" before walking off. In September, I quit my job there to focus on school again, and in my last week I'd would ring her up on the register before we quickly went separate ways. Between not being in school and seeing her all the time, I went through a really bad loneliness and depression spell, almost going over the edge. Temptation hit me on a few occasions.

Again, the story still doesn't end here.

Fast forward to October. I would go into the gas station in the mornings to buy coffee for the drive to school. She had recently picked up work there. It was a couple of weeks of silence. Then, one morning, I hear someone say ""are you not working at the store anymore? I haven't seen you in there."" It was her. I told her I left to focus on school, and she said she had a lot of respect for anyone doing college level math, then briefly apologized about before, saying she had stuff going on (to her credit, she had some health stuff come up). She said it was really nice to see me and talk to me, then said she invited me to come over and say hi at anytime. I was very shocked and had a hard time accepting that this was actually happening. They really do come back

The next day, I went in and talked to her for a little bit, keeping it at small talk before I left. Then, the next day I went in but didn't talk to her this time. Another day I pulled up, but saw her car so I immediately drove out. I haven't been in since, except on the day that she's off.

I really miss her so much, and after 8 months, I still feel so conflicted. I want to rekindle with her but don't want to be hurt again, especially being in my last year of school, I don't know if I can give her any more of my energy or time.

The final (or maybe current) piece of the story was yesterday, or a few weeks after seeing her at the gas station. I talked to my therapist and told her that I still think of my former FWB, and can't get rid of these feelings for her. She said that I should write a pros and cons list, and said that perhaps I should go for it and give her another chance, but she'll support me either way whether I do or not.  I am so tempted, I shared a strong connection and have a lot in common. I'd like to restore the friendship I shared with her.

Tl:Dr: online dating within my small town. A couple of weeks of chemistry with a FWB then ghosted. Saw her at my work with multiple glances, and tried to say hi a few times, then talked to me and apologized when she saw me at her work one day. Therapist suggested giving her another chance.

I forgot to mention, I could see she was pretty active on FB dating after we stopped talking, even making a new account just a few days after I saw hers and swiped left

What do you guys think?

Edit: I forgot to add, her friendship left a lasting influence on me. I made some changes in my life, and also started getting into nature and art again ",1,1730315433.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False
1gful3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gful3b/what_is_the_best_way_for_me_to_help_here/,What is the best way for me to help here?,"My wife (37F)  and I (37) have three children 5,3,4 months.  My wife is a SAHM and is still very much feeling some postpartum issues. She still wakes up several times a night to nurse, the baby,  so she is definitely not getting as much sleep as she’d like. I am fortunate enough to be able to let her sleep until 10 AM most days (I let her sleep til she gets wakes up on the weekend. Often as late as noon) as I often work from home. I do everything around the house: I cook all the meals, clean all the dishes, usually give the kids their baths, do all the grocery shopping (where I take the kids with me to give her some alone time).  

My wife is still very much depressed and extremely insecure about the weight she has gained since having children.  Before kids, she definitely was in great shape as she did CrossFit and ate well, and she is always saying how she can’t wait to start losing weight once the baby sleeps a little bit better. I actually do understand where she’s coming from here.  We are definitely in a tough season. 

 This Christmas will be the first time that every single person in my family, including spouses and kids will be together.  We really aren’t sure when this will happen again. My sister asked if we’d want to all get “dolled up” for a family picture, and my wife almost lost it. She said she doesnt want to take the picture because everyone is going to think of how fat she is.  She’s not nearly as big as she thinks she is, but my family are all in great shape, as we stay active and limit crap. So she is even more insecure for this reason.  She sent me a screenshot of a conversation with her best friend explaining how she doesn’t want to be in the picture, and her friend (who is always a victim enabler) said my family is clearly overstepping my wife’s boundaries.  

Since this baby was born,  I have offered to meal prep for her, take over nighttime feedings, ( baby really doesn’t take a bottle, but I have offered to Rock him when he’s not actually nursing so she can go back to sleep) and she will not let me. I give her a minimum two hours a day to herself, which should be used for whatever she wants to do, but she rarely does anything that would actually help her.  She often says she wants to start working out, but she usually just sits on the couch (which she has done all day) and eats potato chips and drinks wine to help her with her stress.  I have often suggested going for walks during the day and for her alone time, as it will help her. She gets really frustrated with me when I suggest that. I have typically bit my tongue about this issue until Christmas picture came up.  The boundaries thing just opened up a box with me. Her friend is extremely unhappily married, and literally has nothing in life that my wife and I want. 

I am beyond frustrated, because all she does is sit inside all day.  My wife never even goes as far as the park with the kids. She never goes on walks, and there are days on end where she does not even see sunlight. She just sits inside and holds the baby. She usually only leaves the house once a week to take the girls to gymnastics, and that is after I have gotten them completely ready to go, made my wife coffee to go, and have to wake her up to drive them there as I work. I get really frustrated knowing all the efforts and offers I have made to help her, yet she is refusing to change anything. The fact that me, the working dad (yes I work from home, but I am also at least 50% of the time seeing customers) am the one who takes the kids to the park 9/10 times. 

I am not saying this  to complain about my wife. I am choosing to love her during this difficult time.  I also know that me doing all of the things to help her seems like enabling, but it’s only been like this the last few months with the baby. 
I am just curious what I could actually do to help her here. I know this is not my wife. This is a postpartum and sleepless version of my wife.  But a version I’m worried will never change. I have never really let this bother me, until she reached out to the victim, enabling friend who said that my family is overstepping their boundaries by wanting to take a photo together. I am surprised and proud of how well I actually didn’t lose my shit in that moment, but internally this is really messing with me. Obviously it’s about more than a he Christmas picture, but It’s been a few days, and I’m still frustrated just thinking about it.  I will do everything necessary before even considering leaving her, but this thought had never once hit me until now. I’m so fucking mad, but really think I need to get her some professional help (which she is too stubborn to seek at the moment). 

 Does anyone have any good suggestions on how I can help her take responsibility and stop living like she is?  Or is this just a post partum thing I need to be patient with?
I really want to believe that life is going to get better when she starts sleeping and  her hormones balance out, but I honestly have some serious doubts.  ",4,1730315391.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

1gfubba,https://www.reddit.com/r/JuJutsuKaisen/comments/1gfubba/significance_of_yuko_ozawa/,Significance of Yuko Ozawa,"So like a lot of people probably were during and after the manga ended, I was a bit confused about Yuko Ozawa's significance in the story. TL/DR is at the bottom.

But I've been rewatching season 2 and something she said caught my attention. So I'm posting this to see if I'm cooking or not.

So the narrative of that flashback sequence was the following:  
  
Yuko hears Yuji say that out of all people in his class he likes her, because of the way she eats and her handwriting.  
  
She leaves and does nothing about it because she think's she isn't good enough for him.  
  
Years later after a growing like 3 foot taller and losing a lot of weight she sees him again and considers if she is good enough with how she looks now, which leads to her asking Nobara in the coffee shop etc.

When Yuji sees her for the first time in years he immediateley recognises her despite looking completely different, once again suggesting that Yuji sees people for who they are rather than their physical attributes.  


When leaving the restaurant Yuko says something that caught my eye.

https://preview.redd.it/3swenl6dvxxd1.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ee8dd8d9982cfff39d0826376bdb1ec4c4e3e2

https://preview.redd.it/bvkobo89vxxd1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01ef11acddfdcb2081486ceca6dec4848d85b26

She says that **Yuji was looking at a side of her that she wasn't aware was there**, and ""**I thought ""Maybe with how I look now, I might..."" I'm living by the same standards of people I hate""**.  


Basically she's saying, she didn't conform to standards before even though Yuji saw past those standards. And now that she meets the standards she could have a chance. But she won't take the chance because those standards are held by people she hates.

And this made me think after reading the end of the manga: Is that not the relationship of Yuji and Sukuna?

Sukuna's hedonistic views do not conform with societal standards, putting it lightly. And he hates people that perpetuate those standards, like Yuji.

When Yuji opens his domain for the first time, a lot of people were confused at what that was, but it was Yuji desperately looking for that other side of Sukuna that Sukuna doesn't know is there. 

Eventually when Sukuna is expelled from Megumi, Yuji gives him one last chance to show him that side. The same way that Yuko might have a chance after changing.

https://preview.redd.it/ou5ei7ulvxxd1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=812e32f5e61a2b0cf1693b74dc8ac927fb4e3376

Sukuna does consider it, and we know this because of him walking into the next life with Uraume.

https://preview.redd.it/5bewev7zvxxd1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ae581f8bfc0d21de0d984f117dca8de3891325

He considers it, but chooses against it. Because that would be living by the same standards as the people he hates (Yuji). This is the exact revelation Yuko experiences. He has a chance, but denies it because it would mean going against who he is.



It could also be said that him taking on Yuji's suggestion in the end could be the same as Yuko moving on to find love with someone else.

  
TL/DR:  
Yuko Ozawa chooses against asking Yuji out now that she has changed because she hates the standards that she didn't conform to in her childhood, as well as the people who perpetuate them.  
Sukuna chooses against living with Yuji and abandoning his hedonism because he hates the standards that he didn't conform to in his life, as well as the people who perpetuate them.

  
I would really like opinions on this idea because I think Yuko could've actually been intended as a narrative device to show Yuji and Sukuna's relationship early on. Which makes sense as to why she wasn't really mentioned again, because she had already fulfilled her purpose in the story.

People might say that I shouldn't give Gege this much credit and its just a coincidence but Gege LOVES to tell his story in unorthodox ways that you have to think hard about",21,1730314713.0,JuJutsuKaisen,19,0.92,False

My workplace recently announced that we'll be moving from Hybrid 3x a week in office to 4x a week in office starting in March 2025. I *hate* my commute (it's in an area of the city notorious for having shitty transit, driving *and* cycling options - a true wasteland even though it's spitting distance from downtown). So, I startedlooking around for other roles - but I do have a few months still so I don't *need* to accept the first job offer that comes along. There's also the chance that my office walks back the 4x a week in-office thing because people are really mad about it. 

But I'd hate to turn this down, not find anything better, and be stuck commuting 4x a week come March 1. 

Most of my career experience has been with nonprofit organizations, and I made the jump to a corporation in 2023. This new job offer is with another nonprofit so in a sense it feels a little bit like a step backward/retreat - but I think that's mostly in my head? It's for a Senior Manager role (currently in a Manager role) which is a step forward, technically speaking. I also really resonate with the mission of the nonprofit and personally know a handful of people that have benefited from them, who all speak glowingly of the organization.

There's not a lot of people in my life I'm comfortable talking about career stuff with once talking about compensation is in the picture (I do have mentors, peers, etc. - I'm just not comfy talking about money with people) so it's hard for me to get their feedback on the 'bigger picture' - I'm hoping y'all can help!!

**Current Job**

*Compensation*

* $88k base salary 
* 5% RRSP match
* annual bonus of ""up to 10%"" (last year, it was 7% - depends on both my performance and the company's performance, getting the full 10% is pretty unheard of afaik) 
* $1,500 in stock annually (stock is doing pretty well of late and is beating the TSX Composite benchmark a healthy margin)
* $500 ""Wellness Stipend""
* $500 HSA 

*QOL/Other Factors* 

* 3 Weeks Vacation, 3 personal days, plus closed the week between Xmas and New Years. Won't get 4 weeks until 2027.
* Hybrid - in office x3 a week currently... but starting in March 2025, we will have to be in x4 a week.
* Commute is 35-55min when I drive, sometimes more - going with the flow of rush hour
* I usually bike to work but sometimes drive (drive maybe 33% of the time)
* Office is on the edge of downtown in a ""cool"" area - lots of options nearby for lunch, Happy Hour, etc.
* We used to get free breakfast every day, now it's just free breakfast once a week
* We used to get free lunch once a week, now it's just once a month
* I've been here just over a year and haven't really made any friends yet, pretty transient workplace
* I'm a one-person department which means I get a lot of autonomy but limited opportunities for growth, hate that everything (especially admin stuff) falls on me to do
* Even though the company is doing well, it seems like they do a lot of layoffs - there's been a few waves of them already in the ~15 months I've been here. I think my position would be vulnerable to a layoff, but maybe I'm paranoid.

**Job Offer** 

*Compensation*

* Salary offer is for $102k - the salary range on the posting is for $100-110k, I might try to negotiate up to $105k
* 5% RRSP Match
* $500 HSA
* No stock/bonuses (it's a nonprofit organization)

*QOL/Other Factors*

* 4 Weeks Vacation, 2 personal days, plus closed the week between Xmas and New Years.
* ""Summer Hours"" - office closes at 1pm on Fridays between Victoria Day and Labour Day 
* In office 2x a week - unlikely that this would change, this policy predates COVID
* Office is in the Suburbs, literally in the middle of a forest - limited/no lunch, Happy Hour, coffee, etc. options
* Commute would be a 45min-1hr drive, cycling not an option (but, it is against rush hour traffic flow)
* Apparently they run a free shuttle to the office from the closest commuter rail station, so that might also be an option. Haven’t asked for a lot of details on this. 
* Free gym in-office (could maybe cancel my gym membership - and work out after work and wait out rush hour?)
* Free lunch once a month
* Seems like a workplace people stick around at - my predecessor was in the role for 6yrs, and the person that would be my boss has been with them for over 10 years.

* Senior Manager role, managing a small team, maybe less autonomy but also less lonely/less having to do everything by myself?

* Would be a revenue-generating role for the nonprofit; usually a pretty safe position even if the rest of the org were to experiencing layoffs (that said, I've found no evidence of any layoffs ever happening there)",2,1730314288.0,jobs,3,1.0,False

**Context (Listener):** “Pages Of Creation,” a series about a mysterious notebook that warps reality to the specifications of what’s written down. They’re among your favourite novels and the author has come to read a preview of the upcoming fifth book. You wear a shirt of your favourite character, bring your favourite book, and get ready to meet an author who’s meant a lot to you…as you have to her…

**Context (Speaker - Ellen):** You’re a bestselling author who went from rags to riches. You had some trouble with your old publishing company but managed to find success under a new one. But it hasn’t all been good. Your latest book had some controversial decisions on the ending, and people are skeptical of this new one. **(Spoilers, please read the script first):** >!It got so bad you used a magical object you based the series on to make yourself an ideal lover. And now that they’re standing before you, a fan of your series. And you’ll finally be able to counter the stress that releasing a new project brings. !<

**Context (Speaker - Alice):** You’re just a really big fan of this series. That’s about it. 

*\[Actions and sounds look like this.\]*

*(Emotional directions look like this.)*

**SCRIPT START:**

*\[The listener stands in the middle of the crowded line in the bookstore. Someone walks away. A really peppy fan comes in. She places a book at the author’s table.\]* 

**Alice:** Oh…my…GOD! Ellen Queen! It is really you!

**Ellen:** *(Chuckles)* In the flesh. And who am I making this out to?

*\[Ellen takes out a pen and begins signing the book.\]* 

**Alice:** Alice, please. But also, a few friends! Brianna and Carly. They’re going to scream when they see this! *(Fanning herself)* God, I’m like, your biggest fan. I’ve fallen for so many of your characters, it kills me inside when something bad happens to them!

**Ellen:** *(Amused)* Then just don’t get so attached. 

**Alice:** They’re all so real, it’s hard not to! Like Danica and Carlos and Harper and Troy and The Night God and Stephanie and *especially* Ray! *(Heartbroken)* Oh…Ray…Did he really…

**Ellen:** *(Has answered this question a lot)* Yes. Ray’s saga is over. I know you all like your *(Rolling eyes)* “problematic faves” but when I first started writing Pages Of Creation, I knew what his fate had to be. 

**Alice:** *(Disappointed)* Aw…

**Ellen:** *(Reassuring)* But don’t worry. If you like my character writing, you’ll love New Home. I guarantee the new cast will win you over. 

*\[Ellen closes the book and hands it back to Alice.\]*

**Alice:** Thank you so much! I’m going to hold onto this book forever! 

**Ellen:** *(Sweet)* And thank you for the support. You fans mean everything to me.

***(From this point forward, all dialogue belongs to Ellen.)***

*\[The fan slowly walks away, and the listener approaches. They present their book.\]*

And who am I making…

*\[For a moment, Ellen pauses, looking up at you with the eyes of someone in love.\]*

*(Flustered)* Oh, oh, sorry. I spaced out for a moment. You looked a little…familiar…Who am I making this out to?

*\[They state their name.\]*

If you don’t mind me asking, could I hear your last name? Or at least your first initial.

*\[She gets exactly that, and silently realizes something. She tries her hardest to keep her cool.\]*

...Ah…I see…

*\[Ellen signs your copy of the book.\]*

*(Noticing)* The second book, huh? Is that your favourite? 

*\[The listener nods.\]*

I should’ve guessed, you’re wearing the Stephanie t-shirt I helped design. *(Inquisitive)* I’m guessing she’s also a favourite of yours. 

*\[The listener nods.\]*

*(Flirty)* I love how it looks on you, by the way. It’s like she’s hugging you. Her soft hands around your waist, her head against your chest while she tells you everything’s going to be okay. I’m almost jeal-

…*(Shaking head, faking humility)* Sorry, must have trailed off again. That’s happening a lot today, I wonder if I should even do this book reading. *(Ahem)* So, is that everything you want me to sign? I could do the shirt if you want. 

*\[This offer surprises the listener.\]*

It’s not a big deal. I still have ten minutes left before I-

*\[Someone clears their throat from behind as a polite way to say “GET ON WITH IT!”\]*

*(Frustrated)* Hey, don’t get impatient with me! This is my event, I’ll talk to who I want, thank you very much!

*\[Insecure about how impatient the others in line might be, the listener starts to move.\]*

*(Disappointed)* Hey, where are you going? Don’t worry about them, they’re just…

*\[They paid for a signing, they should have it.\]*

…*(Accepting)* Good point, I should give people the autograph they paid for. It’s just been a little…stressful since I published the last book. I’ve had to deal with…*(Dismissive)* Oh, never mind. 

Just take your seat. The reading begins soon, and I have a feeling you’ll enjoy it. 

*\[The listener walks off. In the distance, they hear someone else step forward. But Ellen takes out a ripped, folded piece of paper from her pocket and begins writing.\]*

Sorry, I just need to write something in my *(lying)*…um…shopping list. I’ll be right with you. 

*\[The audio fades.\]*

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*

 *\[We return in the middle of a book reading. The listener is in the audience, meanwhile, Ellen is on a podium with a microphone. A page turns.\]*

*(Reading)* \-on the floor. She tried to lift herself up, but Raphael’s towering presence kept her off her feet.

Raphael's once kind face sneered into one of complete malice. *(Deep, angry)* “I tried to warn you. All you had to do was LISTEN! But you just had to be the noisy cretin you are!” The sneer vanished. Even he felt the wrongness of the words coming from his mouth. 

*(Interrogating)* “What…is it?” Olivia asked between breaths. “What the hell is worth all this?”

*(Deep)* “...The Pages of Creation…” 

Its title defeaned the room. 

Slowly, Olivia’s brain fully processed those four evil words. “That’s what you’ve been working towards? A book that led to the destruction of an entire town?”

*(Deep, panicking)* “It wasn’t the book that caused that, it was the fool using it! *(Truamatised)* I was there, at Greenville. I saw the destruction he caused with the Night God’s Cult. I saw it all burn…”

Raphael closed his eyes, trapped between those terrifying memories of fire and screaming, and his fantasies.

*(Deep)* “...But I also saw what that book was capable of. And I thought about what would happen if someone had all that power…for good…”

*(Astonished)* “For good?” Olivia would laugh if she wasn’t in one of the scariest situations in her life. “There is no good coming out of that thing! It brings nothing but chaos and sorrow!”

*\[Ellen turns the pages\]*

*(Deep)* “But what if it doesn’t?” Objected Raphael. “This is a book that can do almost anything! The power of the gods could be our’s with a pen! This is the only chance we have to save the city from the winter…”

Raphael stood up straight. The gentle demeanour he carried finally returned to him. The bloodshot eyes he carried seemed red from sadness and desperation, not anything evil. 

*(Deep)* “If we could just write into it that everyone has a spare heated blanket, they’d be saved. Or we could write the powerlines fixed. We could even rewrite nature itself to get rid of this vile storm!” 

The man lowered himself to Olivia’s height. 

*(Deep, regretful)* “I can’t justify what I did to Edward and the others…but I can make up for it. With your skills as an investigator, we can find it. We can use it to bring them back. We can…”

He paused, preparing for a final plea.

*(Deep)* “We can bring your mother back…”

With just a sentence, everything changed. The idea infected Olivia’s mind, pushing out anything she’d been thinking before. All of those sins weighing down on Raphael finally made sense. The pieces shattered by the old man’s actions finally fit back together again, like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. 

There was only one thing she could focus on now. His hand, which had extended as an offer. He could lift her up. She could finally get the help she needed…

…So Olivia took it…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*\[Ellen closes the book. The audience claps.\]* 

*(To the audience)* That was Chapter 12 of 47. Did Olivia make the right choice? Is this side of Raphael his true nature, or another mask he puts on? And most importantly, is The Pages Of Creation still out there, waiting to be picked up? After the fourth book, that seems impossible. Until it isn’t…

Pages Of Creation Book 5: New Home will be in stores on September 15th! Written By Ellen Queen and Published by Laerton Press. Thank you all for having me. 

*\[Everyone claps as Ellen steps down. After it’s all over, they get up and leave the bookstore. When the listener goes through the mall’s exit, it looks like it’s pouring really hard. You hear footsteps from behind.\]*

Huh, don't remember this much rain in the forecast. *(Acting like she didn’t want this)* Oh, it’s you again. What are you doing here? 

*\[They ask the same question.\]*

*(Amused)* Don’t act so shocked to see me. When the events are over and the cameras are off, I’m just a simple woman, nothing more. 

The sudden rainstorm’s keeping you in the mall, isn’t it? I don’t see why. It’s just a small jog to your car, right? 

*\[...The listener scratches their head.\]*

No car? Then how did you get here?

*\[They explain.\]*

Ah. But the nearest stop is a good walk away. You’d be more soaked than a kitchen sponge…

What if I helped you out?

*\[Me?\]*

Yes, you. You’ve been a nice fan. Not too quiet but not too annoying. And you don’t deserve a bunch of rain ruining that beautiful shirt. So why don’t you come with me?

I’m parked nearby. Nothing’s stopping me from driving you wherever you feel comfortable.

*\[It’s shocking she’d ever do that for a lowly fan. They ask if she’s serious.\]*

Of course I am. Just come with me. Are you seriously going to deny a car trip with the author of your favourite series? 

*\[After that, they have to agree.\]*

*(Satifised)* Perfect…See that car over there? The dark purple Lexus? That’s mine. Now let’s go!

*\[Both listener and speaker run toward it. Ellen opens the car and both enter it and shut the door. She starts the car and begins driving.\]*

What do you think? It looks expensive, but not too expensive. That’s the kind of taste I go for with things. 

*\[The listener nods and approves.\]* 

…Alright, I’ll just drive over here and…*(Realizing)*...

Oh, right…*(Fake shame)* Look, I’ll be honest, I’m not familiar with this town. And all these puddles are a problem. You live pretty far away, and I don’t want to bumble around on unsafe roads I’m unfamiliar with. So how about another offer?

*\[The listener looks curious.\]*

Simple. I’m staying at a place that isn’t far from here at all. What if I just drive you there and we’ll call a cab once the rain clears? Does that sound nice?

*\[It sounds very nice.\]*

*(Smirking)* You should be thanking this rain. It just gave you a house tour. 

*\[Ellen speeds onto the main road and begins the drive to her home.\]*

So, aside from mine, what other books do you like?

*\[They list off one.\]*

*(Impressed)* That’s one of my favourites too! It actually inspired Pages Of Creation in a few places…

*\[They list off another one.\]*

…*(Sceptical)* Hm…I haven’t heard that one. Is it worth checking out?

*\[YES!\]*

Alright, I’ll buy it…sometime. 

You seem like a modern sci-fi, urban fantasy kind of person. Let me guess, you like reading about people living your Monday-to-Friday life getting caught in something they can’t believe. Something fun. Something different. 

*\[The listener questions how she knew.\]*

It’s why everyone likes it. It’s how I got into it…though…I wrote Pages for a different reason. 

When Stephanie found out that she was a product of the book instead of an actual human being, and then found out that’s why she couldn’t use it, what did she do? That’s right, she threw the book to someone, just to see if she could find someone who could use it for good. 

That’s what I like to do. I like books that place power in the hands of average people who’ve never had it before to show that no one can use it for good. It all just ends up corrupting them. 

*\[The listener asks something.\]*

Well, yes, everyone is corrupted by the book’s power. That’s the entire point.

*\[But Stephanie.\]*

Stephanie couldn’t use it. That’s the point. The person who uses that book for good doesn’t exist. 

*\[...Carlos?\]*

Carlos? Sure, Carlos wasn’t evil by the end of it, but he was still naive and foolish. That’s how Ray got it back. Look, I know what the theme of my own book series is. You don’t need to debate me on this. 

*\[The listener says sorry, they just think there’s more to power than corruption.\]*

*(Curious)* You’re…a lot more philosophical than I imagined you’d be. *(Stubborn)* But I still don’t agree. Absolute power always corrupts absolutely. There is no revealing…*(Honest)* Still, it’s…nice to hear a different take on things from time to time. 

On that note, let’s talk about you. What would you do with the Pages Of Creation?

*\[...\]*

Figures. Endless possibilities are always overwhelming. You want to know what I’d do?

*\[Go on.\]*

*(Smirking)* I’d write a meteor crashing into HeldHand Press. It was my publishing company before Pages. No one would die because the book can’t directly kill someone but it would at least be fun to watch. 

*\[?\]*

They were non-negotiable assholes. But it’s fine. Their sales figures are so far in the ground they’ll discover a new dinosaur by next week. Meanwhile, I’m on top. Every book sells more than the last and…

*(Realizing)* Ah, there I go talking about myself again. I need to stop doing that. So, again, you. What’s your story?

*\[The listener doesn’t really have a story.\]*

Oh, please. Everyone has a story.

*\[...\]*

So, you had parents and went to school at…some point?...*(Sarcastic)* Very eventful life.. Surely, you can remember something interesting. 

*\[...\]*

It’s been mostly reading, hasn’t it? You love reading, and that’s all you can say about your past. Everything else is just a fleeting memory. *(Dramatically)* A rushing river, with the novels acting as a raft that keeps you from drowning in the despair of it all.

*\[The listener gets confused about why she described it like that.\]*

Yes, I added prose to your life. I’m an author, it’s what I’m paid for. If I didn’t like describing situations with flowery language, I’d be posting scripts on the internet.  

*\[The life they live doesn’t seem very flowery.\]*

Sure, *you* might not think your life is eventful enough to be a novel, but I think everyone’s life can be interesting if you just look at it from the right angle…

*(Knows something they don’t)* In fact, I think your life could be very, VERY interesting. You just haven’t found that angle yet. But don’t worry. I think you’ll find it soon…

*\[The listener thinks of something.\]*

Your friends? You think they make your life...*(Noticing)* Oh, hold on...

*\[Ellen stops the car at a large house at the edge of town.\]*

We’re here. Go on inside. Make yourself at home. 

*\[Both run inside from the ran. The listener enters first. Ellen follows and closes the door behind her. The listener is impressed with the house.\]*

I don’t like to think I live anywhere specifically. I have a lot of houses across this country that I crash into from time to time. 

*\[How many?\]*

About…19 now? Maybe? I’ve lost count. 

*\[Wow!\]*

I know, I didn’t think I had that much money either, but here we are. I don’t have any servants here, I wanted it to be just me and my guest…*(Catching herself)* I-If I hypothetically met an old friend or someone who wanted to talk business, of course. I wasn’t expecting a fan. 

*(Faking shame)* Oh, look at me. 2 seconds of having company and I’m already acting so flustered. Why don’t you sit on that couch over there? The storm isn’t due to pass for a while. 

*\[The listener sits down. They notice something at the table.\]*

*(Stressed but hiding it behind excitement)* Oh, you’ve noticed that! Yes, it’s a replica of The Pages Of Creation. I know it might seem tacky to buy your own merchandise but I couldn’t resist. 

*\[They try to pick it up before being shouted at.\]*

*(Angry)* Don’t! 

*\[The listener freezes completely. Ellen calms down and clears her throat.\]*

*(Stern)* Don’t…please. I’ve been using that as an…idea notebook. You might flip to a page that contains spoilers for what’s to come, and we wouldn’t want that. So please, promise not to open it, okay? 

*\[...\]*

Good. I don’t have many rules. Just don’t break anything and don’t wander off. You’re an honest person, so I doubt you’d have trouble with that. 

*\[I am?\]*

*(Anxious)* Y-You seem that way, I mean. Forget my fumbling. Would you like something to drink? I have tea, coffee, hot chocolate.

*\[...\]*

Hot chocolate, as you wish. 

*\[Ellen leaves the room to brew some hot chocolate. As she does so, the listener hears what sounds like a small piece of paper falling near a closet. They walk over to investigate. And when they open it up, they’re silent. Shocked. It’s a pinboard…of them…\]*

*\[The door opens. Ellen walks in.\]*

So, funny story, I’m out of hot…*(Realizing)*...Oh…

*(From here, Ellen’s tone is a little darker and more intimidating.)*

…So, you found it. That was a lot faster than I expected. 

I was so excited to bring you here that I never realized all the danger until you were already in the house. Figures you’d rummage in my closet. Let me guess, one of the photos fell. *(Quietly mad)* Knew I should’ve fixed that damn pin. 

*\[The listener steps forwards and brings up the pictures.\]*

They were all taken by a PI. I’ve had him tail you for about a month now, providing me with every piece of information…Just so I could determine if it was really you. 

*\[Really me?\]*

Yes, “Really you.” Which, in this context, means my true love. 

*\[...\]*

*(Chuckling)* If you’re creeped out by that, you’re going to love this part. 

You’ve already gone snooping, so that’s one rule broken. *(Playful)* So what the hell? Break them all!

*\[The book is lifted from the table and thrust upon the listener.\]*

Go on…take a peak. 

*\[Pages are flipped through.\]*

Seems like a bunch of random doodles and events, right? Well, watch what happens when I take my pen and do this…

*\[Some writing is heard from the book. Suddenly, silently, and out of nowhere, there’s a mug on the table.\]*

Look…The hot chocolate you ordered. Go on, take a sip…

*\[The listener does as she says and takes the sip.\]*

It came from the book. Just like in Pages Of Creation…

*\[This has to be a trick.\]*

It isn’t. Your eyes aren’t playing a trick on you. It’s not a dream either. All of this is real. 

*\[The listener is shocked. The magic from their favourite book series became real…\]*

You’re looking at it the wrong way. The Pages Of Creation didn’t “become real.” I just wrote a book about something that already existed before. 

*(Explaining)* A decade ago, I wrote Lightest Night, and it was a massive success. But it was also a one-off. No sequels were meant to be made. HandHeld didn't like that answer. *(Bitter)* They got greedy and refused every single original idea I had until I wrote that stupid sequel. It’s like asking someone to go milk a cow’s dried-up skeleton. 

So I caved in and did some research on cults and supernatural entities for inspiration…*(Ominous)* But I found something. A ritual. I wanted to know how it felt to perform one…and I did…And it worked. 

I don’t know what I summoned, but it gave me an offer. A book which could control reality for my soul after death…It was too good to turn down, so I took it. 

*\[The listener objects.\]*

Look, the way I see it, that entity was the foolish one. It gave the powers of a god to a creative person and expected her not to think of someone way out of this deal. I’ll find it. I’ve gotten out of deals with devils before. For example…

*\[Pages filp.\]*

There. That logo on the book. It’s the publishing company I use, Laerton Press. The logo, the location, the budget, and the employees. It’s all in there…

I was so tired of HeldHand that I made my own company. It was big, author-friendly, and happy to support my…new idea. It was about a book which could control everything. 

Now, I actually wrote the book by hand, no magic required…Though, funny story, I’ve only spent a small fraction of the revenue. The house you see here? Generated by the book. All of my homes are. It’s so easy…

*\[The listener thinks this is all insane.\]*

Yes, it is insane. If you need to write insane fiction, reality is a good place to look. But what if I told you it goes deeper…

…Page 367…If you flip there, nothing will be the same. You won’t see life the way you did when you entered this house…Or you can leave, and I’ll use this book to erase your memory of this ever happening. It’s your choice…

Would you like to live in reality, or do you want things to get…interesting...

*\[...After a moment of thinking, the listener flips to the page she asked…They immediately drop the book and step back. Their entire world has just been shifted…\]*

*(Ellen laughs. Whether it’s a light chuckle or a full-on maniacal laugh is your choice.)*

*(Wickedly Smug)* So, how do you like the new character? I’m sure you’ll find this one relatable…just like how you relate to Stephanie. I guess you know why now. 

\[The listener steps back and asks what’s going on.\]

Isn’t it obvious? It’s you. Your build, your general looks, your initials, your moral traits and interests. All of the things that make you just my type…

Once upon a time, Pages Of Creation: Night God’s Dawn was published. And my fanbase was never the same. Endless debates over Ray’s death, and who was right, and what any of it meant. *(Bitter)* I thought it was all pretty damn obvious! But Ray apologists had to make my life miserable. 

I started getting harassed online and even through the mail…*(Ashamed)* It was...getting to me...I think I needed someone. Everyone needs love, and I felt like someone to cuddle me through all this wouldn’t hurt.

I didn’t just want a pet, I wanted someone I could love in every single way. But dating is…*(Casually)* Dating just sucks. But then I realized I had to perfect tool for finding a lover. The Pages of Creation…

However, the book within the book and the real thing are too different things. Sure, Stephanie behaved like a human when she was created, but when you use this thing to make humans, they come out…bland. Like robots. I needed something more.

So, I wrote down my type. Someone honest, kind and smart. Someone who likes long walks. Someone who looks like…well, you. And someone who would appreciate my works, and therefore, me. Then I threw them into a random place so they could live like a normal human and inherit the experiences and traits that make humans interesting. 

And so, you woke up somewhere and lived a life I can’t wait to find out more about…

*\[...The listener sits down for a moment. Ellen comes closer.\]*

*(Sympathetic)* Aw, did that give you an existential crisis? Well don’t worry, you turned out exactly how I wished.

I once wrote myself a disguise and attended a fan convention, just to see what this fanbase is like when you aren’t the most important person in the room. And then I found you among the crowd.

Wasn’t long before a PI followed you for me, just to see if I got the right person. And now that I’ve met you face to face, I have no doubts about it. You are the lover of my dreams…

I’ve always wanted to…comfort someone. And you do look a bit sad. So let me just…

*\[Ellen sits on the couch and holds the listener in her arms.\]*

*(Comforting)* It’s alright…It’s okay…This is the beginning of something beautiful. This is the beg-

*\[The listener pushes her off and gets up.\]* 

*(Quietly angry)* Don’t you dare push your creator like that…

*\[The listener tries to run for the door. Stephanie grabs her book and writes something down. The entire door disappears, leaving them sealed.\]*

Did you think you could escape? I control everything. The rainstorm, the house, the staff if I decide to write them back into existence. Everything. Making all the doors disappear is just a speck of my power. 

*\[The listener tries to push on the wall, hoping for something.\]*

If you think you’re leaving here against my will, you aren’t as smart as I had written you. *(Intimidating)* You’re my creation. My intellectual property! MINE! 

*\[Realizing how off she sounds, Ellen collects herself.\]*

*(Ahem)* I apologize for the outburst, I’ve just been waiting a good while for this to happen…

…It won’t be all bad. You get to keep your free will.

*\[The listener pauses.\]*

Yes, just like in the books, I can’t affect a soul’s right to choose. That even applies to pseudo-souls like yours. I could have written that you’d follow all my commands before you were created, but I wanted a person to talk to, not a body pillow with the word “yes” scribbled on. 

You know what? I’ll even give you a choice. Can’t live in a house without doors, after all.

*\[Ellen writes something down in the book.\]*

There, all better. But before you use that door, just hear me out…

…I can make your life hell. I could find out if you have a date and ruin it. I could burn all your friend’s houses down so they’d have to move. I can do all sorts of things to your social life.

And I know where you work. I could write it out of business. I could write that all the corporations on earth just hate your guts and won’t hire you, except Laerton. Then you could work with me…

*(Amused)* That doesn’t sound half bad, actually.

*\[They look angry.\]*

*(Casually)* No, I’m serious! Haven’t you ever had an idea for a novel?

*\[...Yes\]*

*(Smirk)* Then all Laerton would need is a manuscript and a word from me. Then it’s published. 

Even without all this reality-warping chicanery, you’d still be dating a multi-millionaire. And not even the kind that constantly gets stopped for photos and harassed by the press. It’s perfect! 

*\[The listener mentions the villains of Pages Of Creations.\]*

…Yeah…Maybe I am acting like a villain from the novels. The book corrupts everyone, after all. The only difference is that I know what I am. I don’t have any higher causes or excuses. I just want to cuddle with someone and I’m willing to rewrite reality to do so.

I’ll let you keep your friends and connections, but if you just quit your job and move in with me, your life can be so much easier. You look like you need an easier life. 

The fakeness of your soul is getting to you, I can feel it. And if you leave now, those questions of your own humanity will only get worse…

But I can make you feel like a proper human again. Just help me with my issues, and I’ll help you with yours. Do we have a deal?

*\[...Ashamed, the listener steps forward.\]*

…Well, I wish you were a little more enthusiastic, but we can fix that. I promise you’ll see the brighter side of this, love. 

*\[Ellen writes one final thing in the book. A butler and a maid pop into existence.\]*

Meet my butler and maid. They’re like you but obey my every command. Though they aren’t much for conversations, which is why I didn’t write you like that. 

*(Commanding)* Giovanni, Julia, escort them to the bedroom.

*(To Listener)* You’ll spend the rest of the day in there while I clear up some business. But if you’re good, I’ll read a few more chapters of New Home. 

*\[The butler and maid grab the listener by force. They start walking.\]*

Wait, stop…

*\[Ellen comes in front of the listener and touches their face.\]*

*(Sympathetic)* I know this is a lot. And can seem terrifying. But this is a good thing for you. I bet you’ve felt purposeless. Confused. Just like Stephanie. But this is your chance to get a purpose. You can finally have something to look forward to in life that isn’t a book. 

…It’s going to be scary at first. But soon, my soft hands will be around your waist, my head will be against your chest, and I’ll tell you that everything will be okay. Then you can do the same for me. Doesn’t that sound lovely?

I promise you that you’re so much more complex than you think, even if you popped into existence a year ago. I can feel it. And I like the feeling…

*\[As soft as she can, Ellen gives the listener a peck on the cheek.\]*

I think you’re going to like all these feelings too. They were what you were designed for…

*(Lovingly)* You’re my favourite character, and I can’t wait to give you something fun and different. 

*\[Once she lets go, your fellow creations from the book take you upstairs on behalf of the author…\]* ",2,1730313876.0,ASMRScriptHaven,1,1.0,False

The transition from college student to working full time M-F has been a huge challenge and honestly caused me several mental breakdowns. My life consisted of sitting for 8 hours a day working on a computer just for me to go home and stare at a screen until it’s time for bed. My mental and physical health was the worst it’s been. 

A few months ago I had this sudden urge to read a book. I used to love reading as a kid but as I got older, school and having Netflix and an iPhone became more interesting than reading. But… I realized that I’m getting sick or screens and mindless scrolling. So, a few months ago I spontaneously bought a kindle. It was the best decision I ever made. Having a kindle made me fall in love with reading again. I put my noise canceling headphones on and I dive into stories like an escape from reality. I know it sounds crazy but reading has helped my mental health. So much so that I started exercising again. I look forward to quiet and my fantasy stories. It’s so peaceful. Everything about reading is a vibe. Going to the bookshop, getting a coffee, putting on headphones, getting comfortable, and escaping into a fantasy world is genuinely so fun. Anyways, I think more people should read. I feel like a new person. 

I think that reading sparks that creative energy that working an office job totally strips from us.  I know that I’ve felt way more creative and imaginative since I started reading again. I feel awesome. ",10,1730313802.0,GenZ,3,1.0,False

Few things are as essential to the camping experience as a roaring campfire. It provides warmth, light, a place to cook, and a hub for shared stories and memories. But getting a fire started, especially in less-than-ideal weather, can be challenging. For campers and outdoor enthusiasts alike, magnesium fire starters offer a reliable, durable, and easy-to-use solution that works in nearly any environment. These compact tools combine the natural flammability of magnesium with the precision of modern technology, giving campers the power to start a fire in seconds.

This step-by-step guide will take you through everything you need to know about magnesium fire starters, from understanding how they work to learning the art of igniting them. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned outdoorsman, mastering magnesium fire starters can transform your camping experience and make fire-starting a simple, enjoyable process.

# 1. Why Fire Starters are Essential for Campers

The campfire is one of the most iconic parts of camping, providing more than just warmth and light. It’s where campers gather, share stories, prepare meals, and unwind after a day of exploring. However, starting a fire isn’t always straightforward. In windy, damp, or humid conditions, getting a flame to ignite can seem impossible. That’s where magnesium fire starters come in as a versatile, dependable tool for fire-making, ensuring that you can always have a warm fire, no matter the weather.

Traditional fire-starting tools like matches or lighters are prone to issues—moisture can ruin matches, and wind can snuff out lighter flames. Magnesium fire starters, however, overcome these obstacles by offering a hotter, more intense flame that’s easy to direct and control. With just a few materials, you can go from no fire to a full campfire within minutes, all while using a compact tool that fits easily in your pocket or pack.

# 2. Understanding the Mechanics of Magnesium Fire Starters

A [magnesium fire starter](https://www.matchflint.store/collections/magnesium-fire-starters) typically combines two essential components: a magnesium block and a ferrocerium (ferro) rod. The magnesium block is designed to be scraped with a knife or striker, producing small shavings that act as highly flammable tinder. Magnesium burns at an incredibly high temperature, up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius), which is enough to ignite even damp kindling.

The ferro rod is equally crucial. When struck against metal, the rod emits a shower of hot sparks that ignite the magnesium shavings, creating an intense, concentrated flame. This two-step system ensures that, once you’ve created a pile of magnesium shavings, you can quickly spark them into a fire that’s strong enough to catch surrounding tinder and kindling.

# 3. Types of Magnesium Fire Starters and Their Benefits

There are several types of magnesium fire starters on the market, each with unique benefits. Here’s a look at some popular varieties:

·       **Standard Magnesium Blocks with Ferro Rods**: These compact fire starters are the most common type, offering a lightweight, portable block of magnesium attached to a ferro rod. They’re straightforward to use, durable, and easy to store.

·       **Multi-Tool Fire Starters**: For campers who prefer multifunctional tools, some fire starters combine magnesium with additional features, such as a built-in compass, whistle, or knife. This versatility makes them ideal for minimalists who want multiple functions in a single tool.

·       **Waterproof and Windproof Fire Starters**: These fire starters are specifically designed to resist water and withstand strong winds, making them perfect for camping in harsh weather conditions.

# 4. How to Use Magnesium Fire Starters

Using **magnesium fire starters** is a straightforward process that becomes second nature with a little practice. Here’s a step-by-step guide to mastering the technique:

·       **Step 1: Prepare Your Fire Site**: Choose a safe, cleared spot for your fire, away from dry leaves and flammable materials. Place rocks or logs around the perimeter to help contain the flames.

·       **Step 2: Gather Dry Tinder and Kindling**: Collect dry materials such as leaves, grass, and twigs to use as tinder. This will catch the initial flame and help it spread to the larger kindling.

·       **Step 3: Shave Magnesium**: Hold the magnesium block at a slight angle and use a knife or striker to shave off a small pile of magnesium shavings. Aim for a pile roughly the size of a quarter, which should be sufficient for a successful ignition.

·       **Step 4: Strike the Ferro Rod**: Hold the ferro rod close to the magnesium shavings and use the back of your knife or striker to create sparks. Aim the sparks directly at the magnesium pile, which will ignite in a bright, hot flame.

·       **Step 5: Add Kindling Gradually**: Once the magnesium ignites, carefully add your kindling, being mindful not to smother the flame. Gradually build up the fire by adding larger sticks and eventually logs.

# 5. Benefits of Using Magnesium Fire Starters

Magnesium fire starters offer numerous advantages over other fire-starting methods, making them a favorite among campers and survivalists alike. Here are some of their key benefits:

·       **Reliability in Adverse Conditions**: Magnesium fire starters work effectively even in rain or snow. The high-temperature flame produced by magnesium shavings can ignite damp or slightly wet tinder, making them ideal for unpredictable weather.

·       **Lightweight and Portable**: These fire starters are compact and lightweight, fitting easily into a backpack, emergency kit, or even a pocket. They’re perfect for minimalist campers or backpackers looking to keep their load light.

·       **Durability**: Unlike matches or lighters, magnesium fire starters don’t run out or break easily. Most magnesium blocks and ferro rods are designed for hundreds of uses, offering a long-lasting fire-starting solution.

# 6. Safety Tips for Using Magnesium Fire Starters

While magnesium fire starters are incredibly useful, they also require careful handling due to the intense heat they produce. Follow these safety tips for a safe and enjoyable experience:

·       **Choose a Clear Spot for Your Fire**: Always set up your fire in a safe, clear area away from dry brush, leaves, or overhanging branches.

·       **Control the Magnesium Shavings**: Keep your shavings in a small pile to avoid accidental ignition and potential fire spread.

·       **Handle Sparks with Care**: The sparks from a ferro rod are extremely hot, so aim them carefully and make sure you’re not near flammable materials when striking the rod.

·       **Extinguish Completely**: When you’re done with your fire, ensure it’s fully extinguished by dousing it with water, stirring the ashes, and feeling for any remaining heat.

# 7. DIY Tips for Enhancing Magnesium Fire Starters

For campers who enjoy DIY projects, there are several ways to enhance the effectiveness of magnesium fire starters:

·       **Petroleum Jelly-Coated Cotton Balls**: Coat cotton balls in petroleum jelly, then sprinkle magnesium shavings on them. This combination provides a longer-lasting flame, ideal for challenging conditions.

·       **Pinecone Fire Starters**: Dip a pinecone in melted wax, allow it to dry, and add magnesium shavings. This DIY fire starter is compact, effective, and easy to ignite.

·       **Dryer Lint and Wax**: Collect dryer lint, add a few magnesium shavings, and pour melted wax over it. This combination is compact and burns hot, making it a great emergency fire starter.

# 8. Magnesium Fire Starters vs. Other Fire Starting Methods

Magnesium fire starters hold distinct advantages over traditional fire-starting tools. Here’s a quick comparison:

·       **Matches**: While matches can be effective, they’re prone to moisture damage and can be challenging to use in windy conditions. Magnesium fire starters, on the other hand, are water-resistant and work well in adverse weather.

·       **Lighters**: Lighters are convenient but can run out of fuel and are sensitive to wind. Magnesium fire starters provide consistent performance without the need for fuel.

·       **Fire Starters with Chemical Additives**: Chemical fire starters may work quickly, but they often leave a residue that can be harmful if cooking over the flame. Magnesium fire starters are clean-burning and don’t leave harmful residue.

# 9. Best Practices for Fire Building with Magnesium Fire Starters

To get the most out of your magnesium fire starter, follow these best practices for effective fire building:

·       **Use Fine Shavings**: Finer magnesium shavings ignite more easily and burn hotter, so take the time to create a fine, dense pile for best results.

·       **Layer Your Fire**: Start with dry tinder, then add small kindling, and finally add larger logs as the fire grows. This layered approach maximizes airflow and helps the fire grow steadily.

·       **Maintain a Steady Grip**: Hold your knife or striker at a 45-degree angle for optimal control when striking the ferro rod. This technique ensures consistent sparks aimed directly at the magnesium.

# 10. Emergency Preparedness with Magnesium Fire Starters

Magnesium fire starters are a valuable tool for emergency preparedness kits, providing a reliable way to start a fire when other options might fail. In survival situations, fire is crucial for warmth, signaling, and cooking. Since magnesium fire starters are small, durable, and resistant to water, they’re an excellent addition to any survival or emergency kit.

# 11. Mastering Magnesium Fire Starters for Beginners

If you’re new to using magnesium fire starters, practice is key. Try practicing in your backyard or a controlled environment before relying on it in the wild. Get comfortable with shaving magnesium and striking the ferro rod to produce sparks. With a little practice, using a magnesium fire starter will become second nature.

# 12. Environmental Considerations for Using Magnesium Fire Starters

When camping in natural areas, it’s essential to minimize environmental impact. Magnesium fire starters align well with eco-conscious camping since they produce a clean, residue-free flame. Always adhere to “Leave No Trace” principles by extinguishing your fire thoroughly, collecting any leftover shavings, and respecting local fire regulations.

# 13. Fire Starter Techniques for Rainy Weather

Starting a fire in wet conditions is challenging but achievable with magnesium fire starters. Use waterproof tinder such as wax-coated cotton balls or dry materials from sheltered spots like under rocks. Magnesium’s high burn temperature will help dry out slightly damp kindling and get a fire going, even in the rain.

# 14. Magnesium Fire Starters for Backpackers

Backpackers need tools that are both lightweight and reliable. Magnesium fire starters meet these criteria, offering a compact, dependable fire-starting solution without adding unnecessary weight. Their longevity makes them ideal for long hikes, as they provide a consistent flame without relying on fuel or batteries.

# 15. Campfire Cooking with Magnesium Fire Starters

Once you have a steady flame from your magnesium fire starter, you can transition the fire to cooking. Build the fire to create a bed of coals, which provides even, controlled heat. This approach is perfect for roasting food, grilling, or making campfire coffee.

# Conclusion

Mastering fire with a magnesium fire starter opens up a new level of self-sufficiency in the wild. With its durability, weather resistance, and high-temperature ignition, magnesium fire starters are an indispensable tool for campers, survivalists, and backpackers alike.

My case is the only one I know of, and I know a lot of people minus their gallbladders 😁 so this probably won't happen to you, and you're worried enough.

For those of us sans gallbladder currently - I am really really tired of constant digestive issues. I am currently off dairy and gluten as of a few days, and I will keep going with that for six months and see what it does for me. Had surgery in 2022 April, and it just has been a bit of a dumpster fire ever since. We're a military family (just got out, woohoo!) so I don't have an established doctor to help me and honestly haven't had much help from anyone I've seen (GP, ER, gastroenterologist).

I understand that some people don't digest fat well after removal, and that it's best to avoid fried things, full fat dairy, red meat, etc. But I am not eating very much fat AT ALL, I've cut out all of those things, and I'm still sprinting for the bathroom every time I eat. Without going into tedious detail, it's not fat. I'm technically not eating enough fat to stay healthy as it is.

I've never had a problem with gluten before, but my sister does so I've cut that out. Cheese has always been life to me, but I've cut that too. I'm not doing caffeine, and coffee was also life. Am I missing something? Is my digestion just borked forever now? At least blood work shows I'm not deficient in any nutrients, and I'm certainly not wasting away - I've GAINED weight?!? How is that even possible?

I have a cholestyramine prescription. It helps a bit, but honestly just complicates things. I need a double dose for it to work properly, it's AWFUL to take, and I'm having a hard time getting it. It doesn't seem like a sustainable solution. And honestly I had to beg for it by name, none of the doctors seemed to have used it much. 

Any help is appreciated, honestly I've been to so many doctors at this point and they don't seem very experienced with this. I'm starting with a new GP in spring, hopefully that will go better OR I can resolve it myself by then.  ",1,1730313317.0,gallbladders,10,0.99,False

Today it was pretty empty there and it took a bit for them to get their wifi working so I could pay. When the tip screen came up, the employee hot spotting her phone so the reader would work was hovering over it … I hit no tip because the bagel was a little pricey and it’s one of those things where they just hand you bagel when it’s done being toasted. 


As I was waiting about 20 feet from the counter, I heard them whispering about how you can’t please everyone, guess we weren’t cool enough for a tip, must be a consequence of us singing.  

Perhaps I am wrong for not tipping in this case. I used to tip for every coffee made, food pickup , and food being handed over but now I tip for mostly services and sit down table service.

It’s so many little things that add up and make this job make me wanna die

The thing is, it’s not the customers that are the problem, it’s the management and the store.

1. The store is SO dirty. One of our espresso machines stopped working so we called the mechanic who opened it up to find it FULL of cockroaches which is WHY it wasn’t working. The cockroaches pop up from EVERY corner and it’s awful.

2. I get told off when I don’t purposefully up-charge customers. Let me explain. So we have the standard blend and an autumn blend which can be described as softer (this comes at an additional charge). When I’m on tills I have to ask them which they’d like but I have to word it like “would you like normal coffee (autumn blend - more expensive) or stronger coffee (standard blend that’s included in the price)” and it makes me feel so bad having to ask ??

3. We get our weekly schedule a few days in advance - on Friday we get send the schedule for Monday (like, 3 days after it’s sent) which makes having a life fucking impossible

4. 6 hours you get no break

5. Yesterday morning our store was closed as it needed maintenance but people still had to come in at normal time and just clean until they opened late. My coworker told me that none of them were allowed to take their break (worked 7:30am-4pm) because according to SM they shouldn’t need one as they had a quieter morning ?? They still need to eat though ???

6. We used to be able to make a drink and keep it in the corner and when it was slow go and drink some. Now SM has said we have to come in early to get our drink and we can’t make it ourselves ?? I have an eating disorder and don’t trust anyone with my drink so ?? We’re also not allowed to eat on shift. 6 hours without eating or drinking (I think we’re allowed water - yay🙄) is absurd

This got me thinking of a way that delivers a similar experience, and I landed on the idea of a human coffee machine. Basically, the idea is that whenever the Domme wants a coffee, she can use me to pay for it.

My question towards the Dommes and Subs is, is this a good idea? Is there such a thing as a human coffee maker in Findom?
