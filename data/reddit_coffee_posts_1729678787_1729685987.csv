1ga91ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ga91ka/pain_description/,Pain Description ,"Hi everyone. I'm a 42.5 year old Canadian female and I think I have gastritis. I cant see my dr until mid-November. I have abdominal pain that started early September, shortly after going back to college. I told my dr about it when I met with her mid-Sept for another issue, and she said she thought stress from going back to school coupled with the change in routine may have triggered IBS/constipation (I was a little backed up at the time which is new to me- which is why I mentioned it. That part has since resolved) and we'd revisit again at our November appointment. I am still having the abdominal pain, however, I'm having a very hard time qualifying it. Sometimes it's on my right, lower side, sometimes it goes to my flank and/or back. Sometimes it's just my epigastric area around my stomach. Sometimes it is all over, lower abdomen, hip to hip. It moves but it's mostly always constant. It can be 1/10 pain up to 5/10 and seems to get worse after I eat. While it started as right sided pain (I thought maybe ovarian cyst) it's now 90% setting in the stomach areas. PPIs seem to help a little but don't resolve the pain 100% everyday. Coffee and chocolate make it worse I think. The pain feels sharp and dull at the same time. It feels tense or strained like I've done a very intense Ab workout when I haven't. Sometimes I get specific sharp pain right beside my belly button on the right. The lower abdominal pain feels like my muscles are strained or ripping, sometimes sharp pains. Like I say, I have a hard time putting my finger on it. It's a very odd set of sensations. My gallbladder was removed over a decade ago so it's not gallstones. I am getting quite worried that it's something more sinister like cancer as I have two children that still need me at this point. I have had no significant weight loss, fever, night sweats, extreme fatigue, unusual bleeding or bruising, shortness of breath, I'm not pale or anything. It's the persistent pain that's concerning me. 

I am hoping someone can relate and is willing to respond with their experience. How does your pain feel? Is it all over like mine? What helps? Is six weeks uncommon to feel like this? 

I really appreciate your feedback. Thanks!

TLDR- my stomach has been hurting for 6 weeks. Having a hard time describing where, why and what the feeling is. Help!",1,1729685638.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

In 2019 I had a body comp dexa scan that showed more or less normal results.

A year ago, I did another body comp scan and it showed full body Z of -1.3 with spine being the lowest. 

I just re did the full body dexa and also did bone density specific scan. My hip is at Z-1.3, but my lumbar is at -2.5! 

I’ve been on a healthy, mostly plant based diet,  it always had soy milk etc, and also some meat and dairy now and then. 

I’m also on rosuvastatin and ezetimibe 10mg each. I’ve always really enjoyed coffee, so I’d say I have been on the upper end of healthy caffeine intake. (I’ve dropped this down to below 250mg caffeine per day for the last year).

I’ve been taking vitamin D, K2, small doses calcium for the past year. My average calcium intake is now about 1400mg. Vitamin D was 30ng/l. It’s possible it was lower at some point.

The scary part is that if I believe my 2019 scan, this is all within 5 yrs. The only major change I’ve had is the lipid drugs for the past 3yrs.

My doc did 24hr urine, PTH, testosterone. All seem good.

Jeff says he wants someone who looks like a stripper.

\*Sarah is ½ hour late; she says traffic & parking issues. Jeff says to stop making the same excuses over and over again.

\*Durand: Jeanne Shaw & husband Tommy (from Styx). Fix-up to rent. Jeff is consulting. Jeanne swears a lot. Jeff & Sarah don’t recognize Tommy and Sarah never heard of Styx. Later, Jeff says Jeanne hasn’t paid her first invoice and he jokingly gives her an envelope that says “final notice.” She laughs. He jokes he’s sending her to collections. Jeff tells her she works faster than anyone he’s worked with. The workers are living in the property as they remodel, which Jeff gives her shit for.

\*Natasha: potential intern. She wants to leave to go get coffee when she arrives Jeff is “bothered.” He has Zoila make her coffee. Zoila says Natasha is “very bitchy.”

\*Sunshine Terrace: Stacey Farish: Sarah forgot the floor samples; we’d just seen Jeff tell her not to forget them in the previous scene. Gage brings them.

\*Gage tells us something has to happen with Sarah.

\*Jeff’s pissed at Sarah who didn’t take measurements at Stacey’s house. He tells her he doesn’t like her furniture picks.

\*Sarah tells us Jeff is always picking on her.

\*Jeff tells us Natasha was not the right fit.

\*Intern Ashley is late: “Traffic is terrible.” Gage tells us she was top 2, but her being late is a huge strike. She notes that her family owns a tequila farm and she gets free tequila. Jeff jokes that she’s going to the top of the list.

\*Bug in Jenni’s hair

\*Jeff’s mad at Zoila for not getting the mail from Grandma’s house & was late. He yells. Later Jeff’s on the phone with Gage. He’s furious. Jeff’s had it with Zoila’s disrespect & sarcasm. Back at West Knoll: Zoila’s ignoring Jeff. He tells us that both Zoila & Gage give him the silent treatment when they’re mad at him. Zoila tells Jeff, “I’m your employee and you need to respect me. Don’t talk to me like this and I’m going to respect you. Jeff tells her that her behavior is getting worse. Zoila’s voice cracks, “You want me quit my job?” Jeff says, “No, I want you to live with me forever as sick as that sounds.” He apologizes.

\*Sarah tells us that when Jeff gets that angry the best thing to do is let him go.

\*Jeff tells Sarah he’s going to keep track of the amount of times she lies and they’ll discuss it during her review. She says, “OK.”

\*Trace asks Sarah if she got the floor samples. She’s surprised, “no.” Trace tells us he’d reminded her to get them and she forgot. Says most wouldn’t get as much leeway as she does. Sarah says she wishes he would have reminded her. Trace tells Gage. Gage tells us she can’t keep making mistakes. Later in the car, Jeff asks Trace about the samples and Trace says he told her at least 3 times, “this is why I’m perpetually angry.”

\*Jeff tells us none of the interns so far has been the right fit. They all look through the photos and they groan at one we surprise is unattractive.

\*Save the date card for Sarah’s wedding.

\*At Living Square, Jeanne makes Jeff sit on the toilet to check its comfort. “I take pleasure in teasing Jeanne.”

\*Mai is a potential intern. Jeff tells Sarah to show her how she doesn’t use spell check and gives her shit in front of Mai.

\*Jeff & Jenni have lunch and he talks about Sarah. He does a reenactment of how Sarah acts. Jenni says she’s loyal. Jeff says what’s the point if she can’t read and write. Jenni suggests firing her and just moving on as a friend/family.

1ga8qim,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sad_Lunch8508/comments/1ga8qim/how_an_office_pantry_can_boost_employee_morale/,How an Office Pantry Can Boost Employee Morale and Team Collaboration?,"In today’s fast-paced work environment, fostering a positive workplace culture is essential for enhancing employee morale and promoting effective teamwork. One often-overlooked element that can significantly contribute to this goal is the [office pantry](https://ace-vending.biz/pantry/). A well-stocked, inviting pantry not only meets the basic needs of employees but also serves as a dynamic hub for social interaction and collaboration. Here’s how an office pantry can elevate employee morale and strengthen team collaboration.

**1. Creating a Sense of Community**

An office pantry provides a communal space where employees can gather, take breaks, and socialize. This informal setting encourages interactions among colleagues who may not typically cross paths in their daily tasks. Whether it’s chatting over a cup of coffee or sharing a snack during a brief break, these moments foster relationships and create a sense of belonging within the team.

When employees feel connected to one another, their overall job satisfaction increases. A strong sense of community can also lead to improved morale, as employees are more likely to feel valued and appreciated in a supportive environment.

**2. Facilitating Collaboration**

The pantry can serve as an unstructured meeting space, where employees can discuss projects, brainstorm ideas, or resolve conflicts in a relaxed atmosphere. This casual setting can reduce the pressure associated with formal meetings, allowing for more open and creative conversations.

Collaboration often flourishes when team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and perspectives. An office pantry can facilitate these interactions, ultimately leading to innovative solutions and enhanced teamwork.

**3. Promoting Inclusivity**

An office pantry that caters to diverse dietary preferences can enhance employee morale by making everyone feel included. Offering a variety of snacks and beverages, such as gluten-free, vegan, or culturally diverse options, demonstrates that the organization values the needs of all employees.

This inclusivity helps create an environment where everyone feels seen and respected, contributing to higher morale and a more cohesive team dynamic. When employees know their individual preferences are considered, they are more likely to feel engaged and motivated.

**4. Providing a Break from Routine**

The demands of work can often lead to stress and burnout. An office pantry offers employees a designated space to step away from their desks, recharge, and take a mental break. These brief respites can be vital for maintaining focus and productivity throughout the day.

Taking time to enjoy a snack or beverage can also provide employees with a moment to connect with colleagues, further fostering relationships and collaboration. The act of breaking bread together—whether it’s sharing lunch or enjoying a mid-afternoon snack—can help strengthen team bonds and enhance morale.

**5. Encouraging Employee Engagement**

An engaging pantry can stimulate employee involvement and initiative. Employers can encourage staff to contribute by suggesting new items to stock or even participating in themed snack days. This involvement not only promotes a sense of ownership but also keeps the pantry offerings fresh and exciting.

When employees feel that they have a say in their environment, their overall morale improves. Engaged employees are more likely to collaborate with one another, share ideas, and contribute to a positive workplace culture.

**Conclusion: A Key Ingredient for Success**

In summary, an office pantry is more than just a place for snacks and drinks; it plays a crucial role in boosting employee morale and enhancing team collaboration. By creating a sense of community, facilitating informal discussions, promoting inclusivity, providing necessary breaks, and encouraging employee engagement, a well-designed pantry can transform the workplace atmosphere.

Investing in an inviting and well-stocked office pantry demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being and fosters a culture of collaboration and support. In today’s competitive business landscape, nurturing a positive workplace culture is essential for attracting and retaining top talent, making the office pantry an invaluable asset for any organization.",1,1729684704.0,u_Sad_Lunch8508,0,1.0,False

When I was about to pick up the coffee, this staff, who was responsible for closing the lid of the coffee cup and packing them into a brown bag, told me ""dont touch it"" in a very rude tone. I was taken aback so I did not say anything to him on the spot.

Once the entire order was done, I also showed him my attitude, asking him ""can i touch this now"" when I pick up the brown bag and grab the straws.

I feel like this is very uncalled for and I understand if you are overwhelmed by the large order but if you have added a please I wouldn't have been so angry.

Depending on your group of surgeons , they may not even appreciate the hard work you do. The obstacles we have to over come, the stupid questions we have to answer.

However with doctors losing their pull in the medical field to Mbas,no one is looking out for us. They dump more and more work on us and it becomes ,not about a human connection with the patient , but a factory assembly line of surgical cases to book and get through.

","I (F, over 50) met a woman (30s) at an event. She was very friendly and even suggested a road trip. However, in the end, I was the one who asked for her contract number and later texted her to meet for coffee. 

During our chat over coffee, she mentioned something about her friend in her 40s and briefly assumed I was around the same age  (“.. I have a friend in her 40s, and I guess you’re a similar age. She experienced blah blah blah…”) I corrected her, saying I was in my 50s, and she responded, “Oh, no way! I thought you were in your 30s!” That comment made me realize that I may actually look my age, not younger. 

This incident gave me a new perspective, and I took a moment to check my appearance in the mirror. In the reflection, I saw an older woman with darker skin, age spots, and gray sprinkled through my hair. I hadn’t really noticed how I looked outside until that moment, since I rarely check myself in the mirror. As a single loner without family or friends aging alongside me, I don’t have others reinforce the reality of getting older through shared experiences or interactions. 

How do other singles and loners stay aware of their aging appearance and adjust their behaviors accordingly? (For example, I need to find new friends closer to my age). ",2,1729683947.0,OverFifty,3,0.75,False

Lyrics 1: dust been thrown on my body/ 

originality over any copy/

fear like some bitter coffee/

better cop me a gun/

before the cops gun me down/

 handcuffs, got me planted on the ground/

 what a murderous planet I found /

let the dark spirit come in/

 I'm too tired of runnin sinnin,kickin/ waiting for the dark thoughts to get

 darker/

take full effect/

when I feel like a defect/

dessect my eyes for from the truth I'm already blind/

anger livid of how others live it/

 mischief, on to edge of my cliff/

load my clip/

 as I look at my stick /

make me more sick... headed/

 on where I'm headed/

 for darkness embedded/

 as im soon to be beheaded/

 the knives who cut me/

say there the knives who love me/


Lyrics 2: body shivering/

 body blisters/

 from the mister/

 the whip missed ya/

 Gave me a few purple kisses/

 the most affection I ever had/

 the lip stick gave me a infection/ inspection, hide trauma and tears in the bottle of empty beers/

 reality got beaten by fear/

 for windows unclean/

 can't see clear/

depend on there ear and what they hear many reps of good reputation/

 get you your ovation/

word of the street your authentication/ public figures/

get you bigger/

get you another bank figure/

 you make me more sicker/

your last one was the kicker/

I'm a madman with a trigger/

gun shot I just popped the mister/

for those wounds became forever scars/ got new ones from the guards/

sentenced for life behind the bars/

 lost touch with reality/

I can't make sense/ 

life getting harder to swallow/

more and more dense/

 alienated me Like ET/

 chain around the guards neck/

 shaking like he got ET/

 burned footage on the cctv/

 his body fell as blood spill from his neck/ more red on the red canvas/ 

growing number of politicians/

 more actors on the red carpet/

She and I tried long distance for this semester after dating for 1 1/2 years. She gave it one week, in which I was caring of her every need and trying to be there when she needed it. However, when it started to hit me that community college would be difficult mentally (fomo, etc.), she broke up with me. I do realize that I may have been a little overbearing right as we started, but it in no way was a true harm to her experience. We broke up because she felt like we no longer had anything in common and were living two different lives.

I like to think I’m an ambitious person. I’m going to graduate college almost two years early, plan on going to law school, feel like I have a solid world view and seek more out of my life every day, lift weights and have a good physique, have real hobbies (music, soccer, a little bit of backpacking/hiking when I can find the time), am pursuing internships for the summer and serious on-campus involvement next semester, and am overall a pretty good boyfriend on top of it.

She’s a great person and all, but she doesn’t really do much. We met up for coffee two weeks ago, and I asked her how the semester was going and if she had joined anything, to which she said no. I asked her if she wants to join anything, she said no. She hasn’t picked up any hobbies. I see her snap story sometimes, and do admit that I sometimes look at her location, and from consistently Tuesday-Saturday she drinks and goes out to frats. I’m also not 100% sure if she’s sleeping with someone, but I haven’t even touched a new girl yet lmao

She says female fans have offered to let her stay in their homes and she would like to do that. Reese feels such a connection and a pull toward many fans that ""I feel like the time is coming that I need to come to you,"" she says. ""I don't need a man in my life. I need these connections. I need to meet some of my friends in person.""  
  
It sounds like she might be panicking and trying to cement her relationships with a bunch of her key fans now that many people who were close to Reese from the beginning have left her channel. If she meets people face-to-face, they'll feel more attached to her and more invested in Relatable Reese.  
  
According to Playboard, Reese got a total of $110 from eight superchats today. In the past seven days, she’s received 116 superchats totaling $1,071. Her channel’s total revenue from superchats is $79,223. Reese has received 9,335 superchats since her channel began.  
  
All of Reese's fans need to know these numbers. She is making a very large amount of money from her channel because the $79,223 doesn't include ad revenue, payments to Reese's cash apps, gift cards, Amazon wishlist items and other gifts from fans.   
  
Reese is trying to convince her fans that she can't afford to pay for her elderly dog's vet bills or for Amazon Prime or for weekly therapy sessions because they cost $100 each. She is lying and sadfishing so she can travel and buy luxuries that most of her fans cannot afford. That is disgusting, especially for someone who's on the board of a charity.  
  
Her subscriber count is trending downward and the average number of views for her latest 30 videos are just 7,533. Playboard reports that’s very low because just 36.9 percent of her subscribers are watching. But Relatable Reese’s engagement statistics are very high. The like rate is 12.67 percent. Channels with similar subscribers have an average like rate of 3.83 percent.   
  
Her comment rate is also very high at 1.67 percent. Channels with similar subscribers have an average comment rate of 0.61 percent. She’s done 373 livestreams so far on her channel. It’s unclear how many of those are joint livestreams from Game Nights or collaborations with people like Aaron or Sterling.

Reese says she'd like to start by traveling to California. There are so many people she wants to meet in that state that she'd probably need to be there for two weeks to travel up and down the coast, she says. Poor H. What is her son going to do while she's traveling all over the place? He has so little stability in his life.

She doesn't think a trip to London would be that expensive, but she says she'd have to plan that out. Reese says she knows it's a long shot, but she'd like to move to another country for a couple of years. She'd like to move to London. ""I don't even know if that's possible,"" she says.  
  
One of Reese's fans tells her to go to the Dallas Fetish Ball. She says she was planning to go with Tommy and she thinks it would be weird to go alone. Then another fan offers to accompany her to the ball and she asks how many people would do a meetup at that event.  
  
A chatter asks Reese what the fetish ball is and she says she's not really sure and she's a little scared. But she already had plans to go to it, so this isn't a brand new concept for her. She's just trying to sound naive and vulnerable.

Reese apologizes again for how she talked about church in her last two streams. She knows she offended some fans and she called out a couple of people and said she's glad that they have stayed with her even after she said going to that church felt like she was stepping into another cult.

Many chatters asked where several of Reese's closest friends were today, and Reese just gave them vague assurances that those people were busy or taking a break and that they're fine.  
  
Reese says the Scientologist she talked about yesterday texted her last night and told her that he watched her stream and it made him emotional that she talked about him and that her chat was so supportive. She claims the SPTV Foundation is helping ""quite a few"" Scientologists.  
  
A chatter asks what happened to Sterling. ""YouTube was never as big a part of his life as the rest of us,"" Reese says. ""But he's doing good. We talk.""

Reese says she's been dreaming about Tommy and about Jeff. She wants to date but she knows that it's too soon.

She's upset with Tommy for telling her things that he didn't mean and not following through. I wonder if she's alludiing in part to the Hulu show that he told both Vanessa and Reese that he was pitching about their relationships. Vanessa, who's also a 2nd Gen like Reese, says Tommy has an ex-Scientologist fetish and that he wanted to call the Hulu show Beauty and the Beast because he's an ex-convict and she's an ex-cult member.  
  
Reese says Tommy used to say on livestreams that he couldn't wait to see her grow and to be able to make her own decisions because she's never had the chance to do that before. She says he would tell her that she really needed forgiveness because she's never learned what that is. He told her all of these beautiful things and then he just dropped her.  
  
A chatter tells Reese to get a good vibrator and she says she has one.

A chatter says ""Your breakup with Tommy was upsetting to a lot of us."" That's true. And it's Tommy and Reese's fault because they pushed their audiences so hard to accept their relationship even though a lot of fans didn't like them together. Then more fans accepted it, got attached to them as a couple and all of a sudden it was over.   
  
Reese says trying to talk about this puts her in an uncomfortable position. ""It was so damn public. The stakes were high and I really didn't think about that because I didn't expect there to be such a dramatic breakup,"" she says.  
  
Reese, you caused the dramatic breakup. From what both you and Tommy later described, your relationship ended pretty normally, but you went on your channel and said he had done something unforgivable in front of H. You acted scared and you panicked a lot of your fans. Then the next night, you claimed to be confused about why anyone thought you felt unsafe. You gaslit your fans and blamed them for feeling triggered. You're constantly putting your fans through emotional whiplash.  
  
A chatter asks what's happening with Cults and Crims. Reese says that's Tommy's channel. It was never hers and he may do something with it.

Reese talks about meeting a friend named Beth when she was 20. ""She was a good friend of mine."" Reese says they're still friends on Facebook, but they don't talk much. Reese gradually keeps bringing these longtime real-life friends into the conversation on her channel and I think that's really going to hurt her with her fans. She has stressed to her fans from the very beginning of her channel that she has no friends and that she depends on her YouTube channel for friends. Her fans believed her and invested in that.  
  
""Beth and I became very close. Beth was 47,"" Reese says. She's saying that she's been drawn to much older people for a long time. That didn't start with her 95-year-old husband Fred. She says she talked about this with her therapist yesterday.  
  
Reese says she always feels safer around older people and she doesn't think people her age work on themselves that much. She's really generalizing and she hasn't given that many people her age a chance. But her friends Ryan and Michelle are near her age.

Several people in Reese's chat are saying they're canceling their memberships to Cults and Crims. Cults and Crims has lost 170 subscribers in the past 30 days, according to Social Blade.  
  
Reese says she doesn't think people her age even know who they are and they're too busy and judgmental and are on their phones all the time. She told her therapist she has no confidence in people her age and when he asked if that indicated a lack of confidence in herself. she said yes.  
  
A couple of her fans said ""Aren't a lot of your subscribers around your age?"" Reese says she thinks so, and she says she's not making a dig at people her age.

Reese says she's addicted to love and attention and that's why she can't date for a while.  
  
A chatter asks if Tommy and H are still friends. ""I don't think Tommy reaches out to H. No,"" she says. But Reese has said not long ago that Tommy and H were texting all the time again.  
  
Reese says she spiffed Jeff and Tommy up a lot. They looked a lot better when she left than when she met them. She shows a picture of Jeff with bangs and says she's really embarrassed by it. She says she got Jeff a new haircut and the right clothes and she got Tommy to stop dying his goatee and he looked more glowy by the time their relationship ended.

Reese says her therapist told her that he wasn't even going to give her any tips or suggestions on what to do because she's really nailing it. Huh. From what Reese says, Wyatt almost always affirms her and doesn't give her homework or advice. That's an odd approach if she's telling the truth.  
  
Reese says she comes onto her channel and talks about therapy and her flaws, but Aaron and Tommy are much more successful on YouTube because they talk about the news.

Reese tells her critics ""You come on and do it."" She says she gets a lot of criticism and ridicule for contradicting herself and for getting so personal. She says her channel is still her favorite thing even if she's losing people. She says contradicting yourself is called having thoughts. No, it's called not being able to keep your stories straight about very straightforward things like whether you have friends.  
  
She says she guesses that her channel isn't the typical YouTube channel, but she doesn't know.

Reese thinks if she switched over and started doing content about Diddy and the Jesters and Scientology, her channel would grow ""but that's just not what I'm here for. This is a healing channel."" No, Relatable Reese is a personal drama channel and a sadfishing channel. At its best and most harmless, it's a Seinfeld-like channel about nothing.  
  
Reese agrees with a chatter who says there are already enough people talking about P. Diddy. Reese says it's too much for her and she doesn't even follow it. ""I'm over it,"" she says.

Reese says she has made progress, but she's not where she wants to be. She says she has very, very low self-esteem and she's trying to find a sense of worth. ""And I think that's why I'm attracted to powerful men,"" she says.  
  
Someone who claims they have never written or commented to another content maker sends a superchat to Reese and says she has watched every single tome Reese has made content since day one and that Reese has changed her life. “I am addicted to you,” she says. Reese says sometimes she needs to hear that because when she thinks about the hatred toward her, she wonders if she should be doing this. Then she says she'll never quit. 

All of a sudden, Reese says that someone has already asked her out. She says he's a Facebook friend who she met one time a year and a half ago. She told him she's not interested right now ""and he got really pushy with me. It was weird.""   
  
She says he lives in Tennessee and wanted to just go out for coffee as friends after she rejected the idea of a date. She thinks he has control issues. ""Which is kind of a bummer because I was attracted to him,"" she says.

Reese thanks her fans for understanding her. ""It seems like every time I do a stream now, there are so many judgmental people and they take it the wrong way,"" she says.

1ga851b,https://www.reddit.com/r/agathachristie/comments/1ga851b/mysterious_affair_at_styles_ch_5/,Mysterious Affair at Styles — Ch 5,"Alright… I might actually be pretty good at this. Some information we’ve gotten in this chapter not only supports my theory, but even *amends* it in some way — although at the risk of contradicting other evidence. It feels nice that I might be slightly ahead of Poirot, although I can’t get too cocky. And I am definitely glad to NOT be a Hastings. His pompous attitude in this chapter was a little bit baffling, to be honest. 🤣

Lots of drama in this chapter! Good to see the return of Evie, and understandable that she is rightfully pissed at what happened and wants justice. (That being said, I was offput by that backhanded compliment Poirot gave her about not being beautiful… how strange of him. I best not hope that he says more things like that behind people’s backs.) As well, some characters were definitely dropping little hints left and right about how trustworthy they think they are… all red herrings of course to get an average reader like me to think *could they be the murderer?!* Probably not, they are still reeling from what’s happened. 

The fact that we learn about Cynthia’s connection to the sleeping powders and Poirot’s hint at something being put in *her* coffee is proof to me that the murderer was responsible for her condition… mainly with the purpose of getting able to get past her door, while being free to make as much noise as possible. There however can be a possibility that Emily left her door unlocked by accident, and that the murderer entered *that* way thus making the endeavour pointless. So, my thoughts on this are that both could have happened: the murderer entered via the passage, but *must* have left through Cynthia’s door. I’ll elaborate on what that entails soon.

Even though I got some supporting information, I was however also blinded by what Poirot figured out in regard to the new will Emily made, and how she got her gardeners to 'witness’ it via signature. (Is that how it works? I am no expert in that stuff. 😅) Anyway, I did NOT see that coming… but given that the evidence was largely hidden from us even if hinted in the previous chapter, I’m not going to knock myself for it. My question is that if Emily wrote a new will after her argument with Inglethorp, why did she burn it soon afterward? Did she change her mind about this amended will, or did something happen in between her writing it and doing it… like talking to Mary, for example?

[Timeline of events](https://preview.redd.it/4vknxsvsqhwd1.jpg?width=1385&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb51ce17d765d75e2273f1db5268c8d71b3df385)

Anyway, here’s the timeline of events. Just a couple of thoughts from the end of the chapter:

·      I am slightly concerned about what Poirot is thinking. I think it’s fair to believe that he would be heavily fixated on Inglethorp’s clothes (considering that attire might be important to the green fabric in the door and that he’s pretty sus), but I have no idea what he’s going on about the temperature. Is it related to the candlegrease, or how much the coffee/rum evaporated in the night?? I have to hope this doesn’t wreck my theory somehow.

·      The fact that someone was able to break into the room when it was locked and take what was in the case really only supports the idea that there is a way in and out that is not connected to the passage… and if it’s not the window, I’m willing to bet it is still Cynthia’s door.

·      John’s explanations surrounding the will, while depressing, are not surprising. I knew that will was going to be a big point of contention, and someone has definitely gone to extremes over it. Whoever they are, they probably haven’t bailed yet because there is not much evidence to suggest that they are the culprit — or they’re waiting for something, like new evidence at the inquest or the funeral where the will’s contents will be finalised. In case you haven’t figured it out yet, I still believe it’s pretty likely to be Inglethorp.

So with that all being said, here’s some amendments to the timeline I made to reflect this information compared against each other. (Everything theoretical is in blue.)

[Adjustments to current theory](https://preview.redd.it/udssq7stqhwd1.jpg?width=4960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5981d80c725376065e65e29c5bf8a2eae37106fe)

Up to the evening itself, everything remains the same — but with the context of events from prior that may explain Emily’s actions with the will. I am only hoping that we get some info from Mary at some point so she can explain what she was talking to her about, so we can explain why the will was burned. Emily must have changed her mind at some point about what was in it, surely?

Now, my main part of the theory is still largely unchanged. (Case in point, I still have no damn idea how they got through Cynthia’s door… mm.) But the crucial difference, I’m willing to believe, is that the murderer was probably in the room after Emily woke — and likely had to improvise after she bolted the door without seeing them. As I write this, I realise that a lot of this stuff really relies on Emily not being able to hear a damn thing… but I still think that *something* like it is what happened. Despite the times in the top corner, I bet Emily was probably awake for five minutes at the most before she started being affected by the poison.

I guess we will have to wait for the inquest to be sure. If it is still believed that Emily was poisoned before she ever went into her room, and it turns out to be strychnine… then there’ll probably be some confusion. We’ll see.",3,1729682762.0,agathachristie,1,0.8,False

The final straw of me starting this thread was the other thread in this same Reddit-section, which has ""Moist"" in its topic. I almost felt excited when I saw that. Like OMG has there been some ground and pounding in SW ? Or even petting, kissing, talk about the deed (other than Kodys hormoanes-talk), or other ""strong"" sexual talk in there to watch. My excitement lasted about 10 more seconds before reading the rest of the topic and realizing there has been an eybrow rising and maybe even biting some lip in the show. And now that has been making waves in Reddit SW-community for being too graphic to handle.

Like.......WTF....Im like so confused.

Kody has about 20 or so children. There are also how many, like 8(?) grandchildren too. Those children had to come to this world somehow. I dont understand how it still is in 2024 kinda taboo to talk or hint about sex, when it hopefully belongs to most adults lives. And for the notice, I do not watch or follow SW for any sexual content, or especially need to know when somebody is doing it and where. But isnt it strange to any of you, that a show which basically evolves around a guy who is(was) making babies with four wives constantly with no remorse doesnt talk about sex at all (excl. Krodys..) and when there is even some hint about that, even the forums erupt in common disbelief.

Like......LET CHRISTINE BE FREE ! BE GLAD THAT SHE FINALLY IS GETTING LOVE AND SOME PIPE ! And when people are saying ""But think about how children feel ??"", I get almost mad. They are almost all adults, who have seen all wives except Miss Crybows getting treated like crap for years with no affection at all. And now when wives are finally starting to have a hopefully normal life with actual love, they should be considerate when they bite their lips ? Or when to give a little kiss or hold hands ?? What is this ?? Are we like in high-school again ? I just dont understand this at all. 

Im from Europe and I do not have any special religious background. Here talking about sex is of course not a common topic to have in your coffee table, but it isnt something that cant ever be mentioned or talked about without somebody being hurt or appalled. Its just a normal thing in peoples lives. That is why these topics here sometimes go over my head.

I'm a 29 year old woman from Europe, I will not say more then that for now.
I have a few things that have been going on in my life, and I wanted to speak about my mother. She have done plenty of things throughout my childhood to adulthood, such as to threaten that maybe we should put down my dog... Because he couldn't ''relax'' she said. Obviously he slept most of the days and was chill, while her dogs (which I took care of btw.) had skin problems and shit all over the floor. One time I almost slid on dog diarrhea... And my dad did it once, I think.
Anywho, I want to talk about the time my mom lured me into taken a job she took, and instead of doing it... She moved it over to me. Gonna keep it short: my mom took a job for about 3 months to be dog sitting 2 dogs. To get up early in the morning until afternoon, every week day. She, herself went to go to her own work and left the dogs in my care. She never walked them what I can remember... And the dogs was with me. Slept in my bed with my dog etc. 
So I basically did her job. And I had no clue that she got paid doing this, well ik she got something. So I asked her, one day if I could get a super cheap jacket from the store, and she looked at me kinda annoyed and agreed because I 'helped' when the truth is I DID the work. This jacket was under 18$ btw. And then, I actually got the truth about how much she got from this job, that I did... 943,97$ or more!
And she kept it all to herself including the gifts the owner gave to her. And I asked her 'why didn't you let me have some? I did all the work after all...' and she just shrugged saying she scraped the lottery tickets and said it had no win on them, like that mattered?
When I took up that she didn't clearfy how much she earned from the owner and that it was practically my money, because I took care of the dogs, not her. It didn't end well... She also took money from me and I had minimum to live by... And if I got more, I needed to give her more. When I got extra money one time, she said ''Good, give more than half to me, because I deserve it after all things I've given you'' aka raising me... Anyway, the whole family stood by her side when she said ''You did accept to help though and the dogs chooses you, what should I have done?'' as excuse... They choose me because she wasn't home! Or even paid attention to them when she was! Not to mention she admitted I would help BUT NOT take on the job which I did... She kept all the money and I got cut off by drinking coffee and eating from their food... Because I refused to pay rent. The owner didn't know... She only thought I helped my amazing mother who took care of her dogs, which she obviously didn't.",1,1729681452.0,self,0,1.0,False

I'm at the point where I want to start saving for full implants or something. I don't understand why my teeth are failing me. I'm adamant about brushing my teeth twice daily and set a timer for 2 minutes with good technique and timing. I floss with proper technique twice a day as well. I use mouthwash. I get professional cleanings and exams twice a year and have since I started scheduling dental appointments myself. Yet, I've had 3 root canals, 2 extractions, and more fillings than I can count. This afternoon I was eating a salad for lunch (nothing too hard, just arugula, goat cheese, lemon juice, shredded carrots, and mini cucumbers) and chipped a good chunk off my molar while chewing. The pain isn't bad, and yes, I have an emergency appointment this morning. 

Meanwhile, my husband will frequently go days (sometimes weeks) without brushing his teeth due to depression and he has never had a single cavity in our 5 year relationship. Every time I go to the dentist, it's a new problem, yet the hygienist says I do fantastic at cleaning. Am I doing something wrong, or are my genetics just aren't there? My father has a full set of dentures at age 55, and my mom has less than five teeth left. 

Does anyone have any advice? Or am I just destined for implants/dentures at a young age? I'm only 25 and I'm honestly terrified that I'm going to lose all my teeth one day. ",1,1729681254.0,askdentists,3,1.0,False

I loved that she sells 30 ml decants, its best you like a fragrance but not enough to buy a full bottle. I got two 10 ml decants and two 30 ml decant bottles

10 ml decants  
Yara Tous (Lattaffa): Unexpectedly quite strong projection and longevity. Closest smell to this perfume is those old Mango Bite candy that we used to eat in childhood. So its Mango Bite with dry coconut shavings. In the dry down you still get sweet artificial mango but with floral-musky notes. Mine was strong and overspraying it made the scent cloying, so limit your sprays

Khmarah Qahwa: No one needs another review on this fragrance but mine was actually quite week. I had to let it sit for about a month, it has improved after maceration. I wish the coffee note lasted longer but the dry down is as lovely as everyone decribes.

30 ml decant bottles

Oud Mood (Lattafa): Another beast-mode fragrance with heavy middle-eastern vibes. Opens with sweet saffron and spicy note, which develops into heavy oud and woodsy notes. The sweetness lingers throughout and dryness gives a bit sweet-gourmand accord. Definitely for winters, you can wear it in day as it does give cozy vibe to me . Some might find it strictly night fragrance. I would have bought a full bottle but we don't have long winter and 30 ml would be enough for me.

CDN Untold (Armaf): Another Baccarat Rouge clone, arguably the best one. Earlier I tried Maison Alhambra one but it was not very complex and drydown was a let down. This one is more well balanced, you get sugary fruits/flowers in the opening followed by green notes of oakmoss and drydown is amber-heavy.

I could absolutely get that sexual fulfillment living as a gay man in the submissive role, but I just cannot bring myself to see myself in that relationship either.

I am having such a hard time settling on if I am genuinely trans, or if I am just so conditioned with internalized homophobia from a lifetime of masking as a hyper-masculine straight man that turning myself into a woman is the only way my brain will allow me to exist in that relationship context.

Furthermore, does this even matter? Is this just me trying to rationalize and justify to myself in order to give myself permission to live and present the way that actually makes me happy?

Is this relatable to anyone? What did you do?

Our story started on the first day of this uni semester(09.10.), i was wearing a nice brown matte lipstick and we met at the entrance while i was running late to class. He stopped me gave me a hug and we talked for a little but he ran to his class also. It sounds like a friendly thing you think so aswell right? Later this day I posted a story on Instagram and he replied to it saying ""Hey, hey it was good to see you even if we ran to class btw your lipstick's colour is so well"" which still counts as a friendly behavior. Later this week (09.12.)there was a party at uni which he went to but i skipped it, but replied to his insta story ""Seems like I didn't miss too much with skipping it"" and he replied with a ""you missed with not meeting me"". We chatted a bit but were more casual after this one sentence...
Later that same week (09.14) he posted about getting a new glasses which looked so fine on him so i again replied to his story with a compliment that ""This was a a very nice choice"" he thanked me and we kept on chatting about how blind i am aswell and how i dont have any pic w/o my glasses and when i said "" i dont really exaggerate it""( i mean taking of my glasses) he replied with a ""sometimes you gotta take of 🤔😮‍💨"" which sounded a bit flirty to me with this freaking emojis 😭😆 after chatting more, somehow we landed on some flirty side of chatting, which was more like he's horny asf. It bothered me because im searching for something serious instead of flings, so next Monday (09.16.) I asked him to talk in private at uni and told him exactly this ""Please, if you're not interested in me in a bit more serious way, than please leave me alone, i have a lot going on in my life currently and i don't want a cherry on top of it, so please if not, than do not cross my boundaries"" he replied with a ""but we just ""talked"""" and proceeded to tell me when i asked the magical ""what if i ask you out on a coffee date?"" that, ""Maybe, we'll see what life bring so"" which made me so freaking mad..... later i texted him that i'm not neutral about him but i don't really want to have an other heartbreak, and he told me ""No one needs to have a heartbreak"" and the same what life brings type of shi.
Days passed by and suddenly he did not greet me at all when we met somewhere (not even a hello) and he completely ignored my existence. Atleast i felt this and this made me so angry cause i think i didnt do anything wrong, and I wasn't even mad at him. 
Some weeks later one day (around 10.01.) he posted on BeReal with the caption ""thats what i like, but only after brown hair"" (he was studying something on the pic; and i have brown hair) I was like damn, i hope this is not about my cause at this point im freaking tired from this behavior. Some days later when we both posted our BeReal he reacted on mine with a ""😍"" and after reacting he changed his one's caption to ""should i ask her on a date?"" And i was like WTF????!! Please tell me this isn't targeted to me... later he changed this to ""ahh never mind i get drunk"" and that was the point when i commented ""well between two session of getting drunk, ask her on a date"" he replied with an ""🫡🫡"". After that he started to acknowledge my existence a bit again and started to greet me again with a hello atleast...💀
At the weekend he posted a pic of his car being washed with the caption ""So wet..."" and i replied to it with the most basic reply😆😭 a simple ""wow."". You thought this was a bad idea? Yes, somehow we flirted and kind of did sexting until 2am....💀
Next week at uni, with my besties we were smoking before class, we saw him coming, and when he saw me... I didn't see man run that fast and yelling to us ""hi, hi , hi, hey, im running to class sorry"" mind that, there was still 10 min left before starting and we went to the same class... on this days's morning he was liking my old 2020 stories about me on my Insta highlight...🤡
One of my guy friend got tired of this, and asked him what up with that, and we atleast finally know that ""he wants something but he's unsure cause sometimes he feels the vibe but than not"" we really miscommunicate on things or not understand what the other is really mean sometimes... this was the ""last straw"" for me i like him but im not intrested in this that much.(atleast i lie this to myself)
This Monday we had a University day(like a mini festival) and his friends were playing beerpong and I realized one of his friend looks so-so fine, so i watched him playing from afar. While that my crush watched me and walked up and down, as you know who is lost and after a couple of minutes he stand between me and his friend so I couldn't watch his friend playing... instant karma came and served the same friend throw the ball between his legs and they fumbled there for at least half a minute before they picked it up. After that he left and i laughed a bit...( to be honest i like how clumsy and lost he can be sometimes, the ""Kevin"" type kinda) He went to talk to one of my friend and i spotted that he looks at me him hella lot, when i got up to throw out my cigarette he was staring at me while i walked to the trashcan and back to my spot. After that i went to one of the handsome photographer guy who i have a good connection with and while i walked to him, he stared me yet again. We were covered  by  a screen, and my bestie said that while that screen was covering us with the guy, he was crazy that he couldn't see what was going on there. Everytime i moved, or talked to someone walked somewhere, he was staring at me...

So thats how it is now. I don't know what he wants, he probably neither does😆 but im tired of it and i really needed to vent about this sh*tshow. My friend are laughing how can i always have ""mexican drama"" with my lovelife💀 I lowkey wish to cry a bit.

1ga7i03,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ga7i03,Current routine/products that cleared my skin,"I was previously using tretinoin for my acne for 2-3 years, as prescribed to me by a dermatologist; however, I decided to stop because I felt it was no longer effective. I haven’t gone back to my dermatologist since it’s quite expensive. After much research and trial and error, here is what worked for me. This routine and the products mentioned cleared my skin, and now I’m only left with some pimple marks.

AM Routine
1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser
2. Mediheal Blemish Repair Serum/Tea Tree Calming Hydra Serum (I use the Tea Tree serum only during breakouts; I don’t use these two serums simultaneously.)
3. Skintific 5X Ceramide Barrier Moisture Gel (I use this when my skin feels dry or needs hydration, though I usually skip it.)
4. Sunscreen (Isntree/Skintific/Fairy Skin)

Note: I used to apply Mediheal toner pads (Green tub during breakouts/Blue tub post-acne) before the serum, but I stopped because I don’t have enough time in the morning to let it sit on my face, and otherwise, I’d be late for work! However, I still use the toner pads every weekend if I have no work, so I’ve included them in this routine and in the picture. 

PM Routine
1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser
2. Cosrx Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel (every other day or two, or on days I don’t use BHA)
3. Mediheal Madecassoside Toner Pads/Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid (I alternate between these products.)
4. Skintific 5X Ceramide Barrier Moisture Gel
5. Luxe Organix Retinol Eye Cream


Spot Treatment
* Benzac Spot Treatment for open pimples
* Belo Pimple Gel for closed comedones

Weekly Treatment
* Mediheal Modeling Clay Pack (every 1-2 weeks)

Tips:
* I let the toner pads sit on my skin until they dry. I normally don’t rub the pads on my skin. On days when I feel my skin needs a bit of physical exfoliation, I use swiping motions instead.
* I don’t use cotton to apply the BHA liquid. I put it directly on my skin and gently massage my face to help it absorb.
* I use Skinsort.com to check ingredients and products that are compatible with my skin type. This might not be 100% reliable, but it gives you an idea of what products to buy or avoid.
* Lastly, I limit my sugar intake: no sodas, juice, milk tea, or iced coffee.

Some Notes:
* I’m on my 4th tub of Mediheal blue toner pads. This really worked on me. 😭
* I don’t feel like the mediheal tea tree pads are as effective as the blue ones, but I’m still using them occasionally so they don’t go to waste. However, I might not repurchase them.
* Research first to see if your skin is compatible with Mediheal blue toner pads, as they can trigger fungal acne in some people.

We talk every now and then but only really see each other once a week.

Just to add context to the sort of slow burn building we've been doing: At one point she seemed distant to me. I decided to call it quits but figured no hard feelings and wanted to express that. She gave me some leftover chocolate a while back so I left a chocolate on her desk as well. After I did that I was ready to barely talk to her again but she started gravitating towards me more, talking more, so on and so forth but always a little distant. At one point we go out for coffee and she pays for my drink, quite insistently, which I don't know how to interpret. I've since asked to return the favor by taking her out for ice cream but she's said no.

A couple of weekends ago our company went away for a retreat. One night, there was a party in one of our rooms, and she was there, and so was a guy called Lewis. I'm pretty good friends with Lewis but I know he's single and looking for someone. They were both drinking a bit and I noticed the girl go sit next to him all night, talking a bunch and getting kinda close to each other.

I was getting pretty anxious by this and it was getting late night so I left and went to sleep, but the next day I notice Lewis seemed to be in a bad mood. I know the party ended when the host wanted to sleep so everyone left at the same time, and I thiiink they left together but am not sure. But the girl came up and talked to me heaps, and seemed much happier around me than she'd been in the past. Both her and her friend seemed way more friendlier than they had been in the past.

I don't know what's going on. Idk if something happened between Lewis and the girl or not. I also felt like she was interested in him, looking at him a lot, etc. But then now she seems more interested in me? I have no idea and am completely confused.",3,1729680207.0,dating,8,1.0,False

I’ve been on low dose T for 3 years now. I’m non binary but my brain feels way better on testosterone and I’m settled in the androgynous slightly masc area that feels like a good fit for me. 

I had top surgery 7 months ago and so far my husband has only looked at my chest twice, both on accident. When I ask him about it, he says he’s squeamish with the scars but at this point they are pretty faded. The other morning he woke up and found me sitting without my shirt on drinking coffee. He immediately turned away and left the room. Later that night he was acting quiet and off. He then proceeded to tell me he was conflicted and didn’t understand why I had to have my shirt off because it was super masculine. I told him that being shirtless isn’t gendered and I was hot wanting to cool off before getting dressed. He accused me of walking by the windows “cause it’s like you want someone to see you.” I told him how ridiculous that sounded and I had every right to be shirtless in my house without being accused (especially when it’s 6am, dark out and the curtains are closed). 

I told him I can’t live with this insecurity and if he was having issues coming to terms that was fine but a conversation to have with a therapist, not me. We left things deciding that we both just need different things but I’m so gutted. He has said multiple times in this transition that he loves me enough to work through it but I think we are both realizing we can’t be true to ourselves and be together. 

Any support or kind words would be much appreciated because even though I’m working towards the best version of myself, the voice in my head is full of doubt tonight. ",10,1729679892.0,TopSurgery,3,1.0,False

https://youtu.be/nR67QlZ8jks?si=K0xCe1SbYxqSIMBt

Here is the full YouTube description:
In the chaotic lead-up to Election 2024, it’s essential to find peace and clarity. Start by reconnecting with nature—go outside, walk in the woods, gaze at the stars, or watch the sunrise. Let these moments of solitude center you.

Make space for daily meditation—whether that’s through a religious practice or simply focusing on your breath. A great resource I use for Christian meditation (from the Jesuits of Britain) is:
https://pray-as-you-go.org

Also, be mindful of what you consume. News and social media can be overwhelming and toxic, so train your feeds to filter out the polarizing noise.

And don’t forget to build community: whether through church groups, coffee with a neighbor, or a Zoom call with loved ones, processing this time with others will help you stay grounded.

Now that I agreed to it, I’m sort of in a panic. I can handle myself pretty well these days, but knowing I’ll be seeing him, my body is now all nervous and tense and it’s all occupying my mind too much. 

On the one hand I want to see him, just to see how it’ll go. On the other, I don’t care if I never do again. I’m also pregnant now and just afraid of stressing out myself and baby.
