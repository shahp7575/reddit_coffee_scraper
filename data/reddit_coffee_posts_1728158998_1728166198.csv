Someone else paid him even more. ","It was late at night, and my wife was asleep. With a small table light on, I sat alone downstairs on my laptop, searching well, I'll leave that to your imagination. I heard a slight creak from upstairs, but I'm used to those little creaks. This had been my routine for the last several months.

Our marriage wasn't always like this, but recently we have been drifting apart. She's become distant, and it's like she's just going through the motions. Sex consists of me lying on top while she stares at the ceiling. We are still a young couple in our early thirties, but unlike our friends who stayed together because they had kids, we enjoy our dinner parties and game nights too much. But now, our marriage had become stale, and we were too afraid to be left on the shelf.    

I finally relieved myself, to put it politely. Like every night before, I went through the ritual of deleting my internet browser history. I had no choice, as my wife often uses my laptop to order stuff. As I went to press delete and cleanse my soul, I noticed a site called ""Sinister."" That's strange, I didn't recall ever visiting that site. I clicked on the link and it took me to a dark web forum page. And there is no way my wife's been on here. She's the definition of vanilla. 

Against my better judgment, I decided to read the page, and there was a conversation between two usernames, ""Gus,"" the name of our cat, and the other, ""Haystack."" I scrolled through the messages, and my eyes widened in shock. My wife had hired a hitman to kill me. 

I slunk into bed beside her. I laid flat on my back, wide awake. Every time she stirred or turned over, I flinched. Should I leave? Should I call the cops? Why does she want me dead? All these thoughts raced through my mind.  

The next morning I was shattered. I didn't sleep at all. How could I after finding out my wife hired a hitman to kill me? We have a routine before work where Alice brews the coffee while I prepare breakfast, usually porridge and fruit. Yes, we are one of those health-freak couples. While we eat breakfast, we rarely converse. Over the years, we've slowly run out of things to say. 

Out of the blue, Alice asked, ""What have you got on today?"" I stared at her. She never asks me about my day. Why is she asking now? 

I stayed vague. ""Just a lot of meetings."" Alice continued, ""Any important?"" 

Why is she probing me? Is she looking to inform the hitman to my whereabouts? 

""Brad and I have a meeting with the board over the merger,"" I replied. 

Alice quietly left the table.

I couldn't concentrate at the board meeting. There's no way my wife, who I exchanged vows with, could have hired a hitman. I was in a nightmare, and I was ready to wake up. 

""And the timescales?"" the CEO asked. A round table of suits stared at me. I snapped out of my trance. ""Yes, the timescales are fine,"" I replied.

As I left the board meeting, my business partner Brad caught up to me in the corridor. Brad was a little older and had a speckle of grey in his beard making him distinguished. 

""Is everything okay?"" he asked. ""Sorry, I couldn't sleep last night,"" I replied. 

Brad smiled, ""Go home, get some rest. You need to be at your best tonight."" ""Tonight?"" I asked. He looked at me funny. ""Yes, our weekly game night. You're hosting."" 

With everything going on, I had totally forgotten.  

It was getting late at work. Everyone had left the office floor. I sat anxiously in my cubicle, too afraid to go home. What if the hitman was waiting for me to leave? After all, my wife would have likely informed the hitman of where I worked. A cleaning crew entered the office floor. One guy had a skull tattoo on his arm. Is he here to kill me? I told myself to stop being crazy. I had a game night to host.

I entered the office's underground parking garage. The lights switched on as I walked to my car. I heard footsteps from behind and turned sharply. A security attendant politely nodded. I took a deep breath. If that was the hitman, I would already be dead. I would never have seen it coming.

On my journey home, I kept glancing in my rear-view. An SUV was keeping its distance. Up ahead, the stop light turned red, and I was forced to slow down. The SUV pulled up beside me at the lights. I looked across but couldn't see anyone through the blacked-out windows. My heart was pounding. The light turned green, and the SUV drove off in another direction.

Back at home, we hosted our game night with two other couples. One couple was Allen and Jules, who always told stories of their latest wine tasting weekends. They were incredibly superficial, but that's why we liked them. And then there was Brad and his devoted wife Cara, who weren't drinking tonight. They were going through their third IVF cycle. 

My wife chose the adult game ""Bad Choices,"" which was ironic as it's designed to find out your darkest secrets. I somehow managed to keep my composure during the game. Everyone enjoyed the questions, giving silly answers. Alice was the life and soul of the party. How can she act so sociable after what she's done? Did I even know her?

It was my turn, and I decided this was the perfect opportunity to slip in my own question. Would you ever hire a hitman to kill your significant other? My aim was to get Alice to confess in front of everyone. 

As I was about to ask my question, Alice stood up and asked, ""Would anyone like more wine?"" Jules quipped, ""Do you have a 1920 Bual?"" Allen looked at Alice. ""He's such a bitch."" Everyone laughed. 

Alice went into the kitchen, and Brad joined her. ""I'll help you pour."" 

A few minutes later they arrived back, and Brad is drinking a glass of wine. Cara looked down and sipped her water. I took a deep sigh and asked a question on the card. ""Have you ever looked through your spouse's phone?"" Everyone put their hands up.  

After the couples finally left, I waited for my wife to go to bed. I went back on the dark web forum. I still wasn't convinced my wife ordered the hit. What if it was just a fantasy? That would be disturbing, but at least my life wouldn't be in danger. I scrolled through the rest of the forum and saw dozens of spouses ordering hits. At what point did their love go rotten? 

I re-read my wife's chilling conversation with the hitman. There was no doubt she had ordered my death. It was like I was nothing more than a bug waiting to be zapped. I violently hurled into my waste paper bin. I wiped the vomit from my mouth and reached for my cell to call the cops. I couldn't make the call. Even though my wife despised me, I couldn't bear for her to spend the rest of her life behind bars. 

Okay, there must be another way. Maybe I could get the hitman to call it off. I set up a new profile and messaged the hitman asking to meet. I stared at the screen, awaiting a response. I had no idea how long it takes hitmen to reply. 

A few minutes later, a message appeared from the hitman. ""Why?"" I quickly typed, ""I need you to take special care of my wife."" Yes, I know I'm incriminating myself, but it was the only way to get the hitman to agree to meet me. The hitman answered, ""Seal's tonight.""

It was now 1 am. I snuck out of the house and drove to Seal's bar, which was located by the docks. I glanced out of my window as I passed the dark waters. I arrived and parked close to the entrance, just in case I needed to make a quick getaway. I tentatively entered the dive bar. Every fiber of my being was screaming at me to leave. The bar was nearly empty, with only a handful of unsavory characters hunched over their drinks. They all looked capable of killing a man. One already had. 

I ordered two beers and sat alone at a table near the back of the bar. I took a sip of beer, but my hands were trembling so much I spilt it down my shirt. I waited for over half an hour. This is batshit crazy, I thought. As I got up to leave, a tall, thin, middle-aged guy with long, greasy hair swiveled the chair in front of me and sat backward on it. His hawk eyes pointed to one of the beers. ""Mine?"" I struggled to speak and just nodded. 

The hitman took a long swig of beer. ""Are you a cop?"" he asked. Before I could answer, he sniggered, exposing his rotten meth teeth. ""Cops don't waste beer."" 

I realized he had been studying my every move since I arrived. 

An awkward silence. ""I found a message,"" I stuttered. ""Let me guess, you want me to stop the contract?"" he interrupted. ""Yes, how did you know?"" I enquired. ""Gus has the same IP address,"" he replied. 

How stupid of me, I should've used a VPN. In my defense, I am running on fumes.

I took a deep swallow. ""It's been a misunderstanding."" 

The hitman casually lit up a cigarette. He seemed so at home like he's had this exact same encounter before.  

""She's already paid,"" he said. ""I can pay you more,"" I blurted out. 

He leaned in close and spoke in a hushed tone. ""Money isn't the only reason I'm in this line of work."" 

His words shocked me to my very core. He stood up. I panicked. 

""I can pay you more to kill my wife!"" 

I couldn't believe what I had just done. If someone had told me a few days ago that I would order a hit on my wife, I would have had them sectioned. 

Old school, the hitman wrote a figure on a piece of paper along with his offshore bank account details and slid it across the table. ""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. I watched him leave the bar and flick his cigarette to the ground.  

That weekend, something odd happened between myself and Alice. We were being nice to each other. It seemed we both felt guilty for hiring a hitman. As we were doing our mundane household chores, Alice suggested, ""Why don't we go out to eat?"" 

I was taken aback by her request. We hadn't gone out for dinner in over six months. 

""Where?"" I asked. ""Donatello's,"" she replied. 

I smiled. ""Our first date."" Alice smiled back. ""I remember."" 

My heart sank. Was this her way of saying goodbye? Or even worse, is she setting up a time and location for the hitman? How could she be so callous as to choose the place where we fell in love? Little does she know, she's the one in danger.

I played along. ""Sounds good.""

Later that evening, we arrived outside Donatello's in an Uber. Wearing a sports jacket, I opened the door for Alice, who wore a beautiful evening dress. Yes, even though I ordered a hit on my wife, I'm still a gentleman. At dinner, in the charming Italian pizzeria, our conversations were stilted. 

""You look tired,"" Alice said. ""It's been a long week,"" I replied. 

That was the understatement of the decade. 

As the meal unfolded, we started to chat like old times. I could feel a spark between us. It was most likely the flowing wine, but we always did have chemistry. I could sense she wanted to tell me something. 

I asked her, ""It feels like you've been somewhere else?"" 

She looked at me but before she could answer the waiter arrived with our bill. I paid and left a hundred buck tip. 

Alice laughed. ""You always did over-tip. That's what I liked about you on our first date."" I laughed. ""Was that all?"" 

Our laughter soon petered out.  

It was dark outside. We left the restaurant, and our Uber pulled up. From a shadowy alleyway, a tall, thin man wearing a hoodie approached us and reached into his pocket. I panicked. Is the hit on my wife happening right now? 

I grabbed Alice's arm and yanked her toward the Uber.

""What are you doing?"" she cried out. 

I glanced behind at the hooded man who took out his cell and kept walking.

In the back seat of the Uber, Alice stared at me in disbelief. ""What the hell was that?"" I couldn't answer. My heart was pounding through my chest. 

We spent the rest of the journey home in silence. A terrifying thought entered my mind. She was not at all concerned for my safety.  

Over the next few weeks, nothing happened. My wife spent many nights staying with friends and family. Our relationship was non-existence. Every time she left, I dreaded a knock on the door from the cops informing me that they've found her body. What would I say to them? How would I act? I tried acting out the scene in front of the bathroom mirror but I couldn't look at myself. 

The guilt and suspense were destroying me. I couldn't eat, sleep, or focus on anything. At work, the merger collapsed, and I was on the verge of losing my job.

I couldn't go on living like this, so I messaged the hitman and arranged another meeting. This time, he told me to meet him at the docks. I had no choice but to agree. I needed to put an end to this.

I arrived at the docks. It was pitch black except for the moonlight shining off the water. With my cell torch, I walked slowly through the maze of shipping containers. What if the hitman lured me here to kill me? After all the best way to never get caught is to get rid of any evidence. A gust of wind shot through me.

""It's getting choppy out here,"" the hitman called out. 

He appeared from behind a container, and we stood face to face. It was different meeting him here as opposed to the bar. Although he was relaxed, there was something threatening about him. 

""I need you to call off the hit,"" I said firmly. 

The hitman smirked. ""Even though she wants you dead?"" I closed my eyes, the pain too much to bear. ""Yes, even though she wants me dead."" 

The hitman sighed. ""There's a slight problem. Someone else paid me more."" 

He removed his gun from its holster and aimed it at my chest. I stood there shell-shocked. ""We had a deal!"" ""You were okay when I broke your wife's deal,"" he quipped. 

I felt like such a fool. Who in their right mind trusts a hitman off the dark web? 

I cried out in desperation. ""I can pay you more!"" The hitman lowered his gun slightly. ""I'll pay anything!"" I pleaded. 

The hitman placed his gun back into its holster. I thought about running, but I was frozen to the spot. He wrote down a number on a piece of paper and gave it to me. I stared at the ridiculous figure. There is no way on Earth I could pay this. The hitman didn't blink. He was deadly serious.

""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. ""I'll throw in the guy for free."" 

""No one dies,"" I exclaimed. 

The hitman walked away. ""What's his name?"" I shouted out. The hitman continued to walk away. ""Speak to your loving wife."" 

I was left alone and confused with a life-and-death bill I could not afford.

Back at home, I desperately tried to find ways to pay the hitman. My life depended on it. I attempted to take out large loans with several banks, but they refused to lend me the money. Was there anything I could sell? I had a collection of watches, but that wouldn't come close. I even resorted to putting my kidney up for auction on the dark web, but the offers were either too low or too weird. 

At the same time, my mind was wandering. Who is the guy that paid the hitman more? How is he linked to my wife?

I only had one option, and that was to get the guy to call off the hit. But that would mean I would have to speak to my wife. Something I had dreaded since that fateful night. 

A nervous wreck, I sat my wife down on the couch and looked into her eyes. I was about to find out the truth. Why did she order a hitman to kill me? But before I could speak, Alice burst into floods of tears. 

""I've been seeing someone,"" she wept. 

I stared at her in disbelief. Somehow, this betrayal felt worse than the hitman. 

I remained calm. ""Who is it?"" She wiped away her tears. ""Brad."" ""How long?"" I asked. ""A few months,"" she replied. 

The affair made perfect sense. It tied in with Alice becoming distant and the cracks appearing between Brad and his wife at the game night.

It must have been Brad who took out the hit. My wife would have enquired to the hitman as to why I was still alive. After finding out she's the target by my hands, she had no choice but to confide in Brad. Or maybe they were in it together from the beginning to get me out of the way. Out of desperation to save his lover, he agreed to pay more.

I somehow managed to keep my composure. Alice continued her confession. ""We met at this shitty bar by the docks."" 

At that exact moment, I realized I had been extorted. My wife never placed a hit on me. She's never even been on the dark web. The hitman was a con artist who witnessed my wife's shady encounter with Brad. By eavesdropping, he gathered enough info to set up a fake hit. He even used our cat's name Gus as my wife's username. 

The hitman preyed on me finding out about the affair and the idea they would conspire to get rid of me. If Alice hadn't mentioned that she met Brad at Seal's, I could have ended up losing everything.

Alice placed her hand on mine. ""Can you forgive me?"" 

I had a deep pit in my stomach. She may have had an affair, but I hired a hitman to kill her. ""We'll get through this,"" I replied. 

We exchanged a tight hug.  

Our lives slowly got back to normal. My wife will never know what I did, but I still have to live with it every day. I searched the dark web forum to retrieve the money stolen by the hitman, but his username and messages were deleted. I even ventured back to Seal's, but he was long gone. It was like he never existed. I could never go to the cops. I would get a life sentence for what I've done. There is one good thing that the hitman gave us. 

Our marriage is no longer stale.

I feel the need to say I have no ***concrete*** or set in stone plans to die, I'm just going through one of those aggressive suicidal thought moments, the first part is mostly cause my previous failed attempts left me out of enough medication to do anything

What do I even say?? I somewhat know why I feel this way, it's always the same thing, I had witnessed domestic abuse in my household throughout my entire childhood (Only child, too. No one to talk about this to back then) and now I'm a teen not handling it well at all

  
According to both my abusive father and abused mother it's ""Fine"" because ""You weren't the one hit"" (Or in my fathers case ""It's been so many years, why are you still hanging onto it."" what this asshole forgets is how he still is an alcoholic bastard who has outbursts, just not as much as back then.) which keeps making me second guess even writing this cause, you know, other people exist. Others need more help than I ever will.

  
I can't sleep without locking my door or being sure everyone else is asleep because of that adult child and his outbursts.  
I can't love myself cause no one loved me back then.  
I don't leave my room because I don't have the energy for it.  
I sleep away and use dreams as an escapism when I'm not at school or have work to do.  
I'm a pathetic worm writing away its days.

What else makes me want to just not live? I was SA'd by a female friend of mine and nothing was done about it. She grabbed my crotch and ass, had me touch her chest, made me afraid to ever turn my back on someone and told me she wanted to shove stuff inside of me several times a week when we were alone, and all that was done?  
I was told not to report it to the police by the school due to this having taken place near the end of the semester and it being too late, or something.  
And as you're aware, school began in September. I have to go to school seeing that bitch everyday.  
I feel disgusted. This is surprisingly less of me blaming myself as I've realized how badly I was treated when my own mother used it to say ""Oh she is probably a disgusting lesbian."" (She isn't. She is a straight girl. She did this knowing I was a queer person and to simply have power over me knowing of my home situation.) and preach some homophobic shit. I was pressured not to tell anyone by the principal. I was in a moment of weakness. I cannot bear the fact she is being treated so normally, not to mention she is talented in art and I get to hear others praise her for it.

Fuck, that aside there is the current, the present. I have people I know, I have a best friend, I have classmates who like me. But I feel like none of them truly know me. I can never tell them anything. I love my best friend of course, but I get to hear him vent and watch him disappear for days at a time and ignore my texts for what? So I can't tell one personal issue to him without getting no reply or just a ""Damn that sucks""? It's selfish to say I expect something in return of my countless nights spent talking HIM out of suicide, but I kind of do expect an equal exchange of support. I don't mind comforting people or giving advice but when I do it and get nothing from anyone, it's draining.  
And so I realized that my only reason of living was people I knew. Because only their company made me feel something. I have no passions except writing which I can't even do well, I'm average in every way, I'm some lazy asshole who never does work on time and angers everyone, I suck with social cues, my fathers bullshit made me fear talking verbally, I have no plans for the future, I have nothing to live for.

I am in a constant passive suicidal state and I don't know what to do. I don't know if anyone can even talk me out of this. I don't know if I will get over this before I either relapse into self harm or find a new way to kill myself. Because sleeping it all away isn't doing it anymore, I want a permanent rest.

I have no way of cheering myself up as I never go outside to do something, I have no one to plan stuff with (as said earlier, my best friend disappears for days at a time, and this week has been one of those.) and I'm so pathetic that if I do anything I remotely like, I begin to cry because it won't last forever.

I know that people love me (I think and hope they do.) but I don't understand why. I'm some silent, blunt, envious, socially awkward, needy son of a bitch who never did anything for these people. They are so much better than I and I don't feel deserving of love yet I yearn for it anyways. But I never feel, despite being told it (occasionally, it's depressing to say the last time my own family told me they loved me it was like what? Pre-covid?)  
Anytime I mention anything about needing desperate help during times like these, my mother threatens to hit me instead if I don't stop it.  
I have no one to turn to about these thoughts and that is truly both terrifying and so depressing.  
Terrifying because these thoughts could swallow me alive  
And depressing because I'm not even loved enough to receive basic help.

From what I gathered, I'm so below an average person despite being average, that I don't deserve basic help. The only 'help' I can reach for right now is any suicide hotline, but do I really want to involve them considering my home situation?  
I don't know how to explain this, but I don't want things to change.  
I want to rot in the abuse, because it's become comforting, somehow. It's all I know and I don't want to leave it behind. This is why I don't want professional help, or legal help? Whatever you call cops and hospitals coming for you after you tried to overdose.  
My only other 'help' is self harm. I've been clean for like perhaps a little over a month and I really don't wanna mess up again because I told my best friend I wouldn't. But does he really care enough? I don't know, I'm afraid I'll feel guilty for hurting the body that was once a small child suffering under a highly abusive household.  
I'm scared. I don't know of what, I just wish I was a young child being held by a loving family.  
I wish I was dead right now.

If these thoughts and mindset don't stop soon, I'll have to resort to a painful death of blood loss or something, because it can't keep going on like this. My best friend always tells me ""I'll get better"" anytime I bring up suicidal thoughts, but that phrase doesn't work anymore. Because I've come to realize that I currently wish that the last time I attempted had been successful.

I'll never understand why I can't feel the love people tell me they have for me, is it because they don't actually love me, or is there something wrong about my body or mind? All I feel is the fear of abandonment. I want the people I love to stay because as I mentioned earlier, I only live for them. I'm so useless I only live for others and to help or entertain them.

On another note as I'm not re-reading this to make any of this into a good order or make it make sense, but if you couldn't tell (which you probably couldn't cause how the fuck would you??) I was forced to grow up quicker. Learn how to lock my door and hide in a closet with my 3DS (An XL, proud of it!) alongside become hypervigilant.  
And so to make up for this lost childhood, I began (in a non schizophrenic way) to imagine that child I was as a living being existing today. Because that child didn't get to grow up, so it stayed. I don't know how to explain that I also think that killing myself would put both of us out of our misery and lay us to rest without sounding fucking insane so, have it.  
This child lives in my dreams, leeching onto me as I try to stumble through my life, sometimes dragging me down to phases where I cry and sob loudly, wanting someone to hug me or tell me everything will be okay, like a child. I try my best to soothe this inner child, but it never works, that kid is here to stay because I cannot move on from anything. And maybe that's not so bad, because I know that child loves me, I can feel it. But yet I must say:

I desperately wish I was loved.

I think I'm going to stop here, I talk to much.  
I'm gonna watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre or something now, it's always been on my 'To watch' list.  
Maybe after that I'll know what to do with myself regarding life and death?  
Man, I'll cringe at this if I do live, It's embarrassing to say I have never been this honest or open in one go, and it's on a goddamn subreddit I decided to post on with a burner account.  
What else is there to say? Hmm, my favorite color is pale yellow, could you tell? My favorite coffee is white chocolate or vanilla, can't decide. Marzipan is my favorite chocolate, on the other hand. Favorite dish is stir-fried vegetables of jasmine or basmati rice. Favorite artist is The Smiths right now, but The Drums or The Stone Roses also go hard! My favorite fruits are oranges, man I do wish I had any of my favorite things right now..  
This made me realize how LONG I can vent/rant for, and still not feel better afterwards, because I have too many issues to ever truly explain it all in one go. Yet I also feel like they are all invalid.  
I also wonder if my best friend might ever stumble across this, if so, sorry I'm so pathetic.  
And sorry to whoever came this far (no one) for reading this word vomit.

My husband sees it as him trying to help me be the best I can be, giving me everything I need to be successful. I have examples on previous posts that contradict that. When I told him about it being emotional abuse, he said it's the classic American feminist mentality that my therapist is instilling in me, and there are two sides to the tortilla. He said he's always been here for me and wants nothing but the best for me.

Anyway, today there was another 2 hour lecture (he expressed his feelings for literally 2 hours). Usually it makes me sad. He mentioned divorce ( not him divorcing me but me divorcing him). He didn't get a reaction out of me at all like he usually does (sad and mad).

So after the conversation he acted very differently. He acted nice.

When was that last time he invited me out to do something, besides a coffee? (Maybe April?)
Now suddenly that my parents are coming up for a week, he cares about what I'm doing?

 Today he wanted to get coffee with me. The last time he asked me to get a coffee was at least 2 months ago, probably more. 

Tomorrow, he knows I have plans with my parents...for at least church and lunch. Now, he asks, ""what are you doing tomorrow in the afternoon? I'm in the mood to play pool. Just you and me.""

Hmmmmm, why now suddenly that my parents are coming up? Plus he already said he's going to go to church and possibly lunch with his friends (his own church with his single, younger, friends who are male and female). Now suddenly he wants to change my brakes (one has been shot for 3 weeks) and cut the grass. He'll say its because he didnt have time and money before, but are we sure? Are you sure it isnt because of my parents? Does he not want them to see how it really is?

Why is he now talking to me more today after the original 2 hour conversation...and subtly complimenting me or saying what i want to hear (our son is really interested in basketball. Maybe we can go to the ymca and you can teach him. I told him im not very good at it, but that you are.""

""This chili is really really good. Make sure you dont give it away when everyone's done. If there's any leftover, i want it.""

He would say its all a coincidence. But i wonder if there is some subconscious manipulation

But I am wondering why there is so much conflicting info? The instructions I'm reading for my particular henna product reads, ""henna is heat activated and we recommend using it shortly after it is mixed."".

Digging up Reddit posts I'm also reading, ""henna needs to develop so let it sit for a few hours, etc"", ""With a water mix, the henna really only needs to sit for an hour or two before putting it in your hair.""

Are both ways equally valid? Has anyone tested this?

One user wrote, ""It should be noted that there are absolutely NO benefits to using either coffee or tea in a henna paste, whether for hair or skin use. Neither coffee nor tea has any permanent staining abilities to either skin or hair.""

So should I ignore the instructions that came with my product that says to use coffee/black tea for more effective gray hair coverage?

Some say acids are not necessary. Some swear by including acids into the mix.

General consensus on temperature of water when mixing the henna seems to be to NOT use boiled water. Some say even warm water isn't necessary and that room temp water is fine.

I'm also seeing that many are in general suggesting to ignore the instructions that come with the henna products. Seems silly that the brands themselves would be putting out subpar prep info?!

I'm getting the impression that there is no ""right"" way as people are apparently getting results using every which way.

Ideally I would like to set myself up for the highest chances of success so it would be nice to start off strong.

For context I am using Rainbow Henna Black (two ingredients: henna, indigo) and I have black hair with incoming grays scattered throughout. Will try the two-step process in the future but for now I am going to see if I get any success with the normal way as it would be more convenient.

1fx13ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fx13ir/i_43m_am_fed_up_with_my_selfishunhelpful_partner/,"I 43M am fed up with my selfish/unhelpful partner 33F, how to fix this? ","TLDR - Partner has BPD and is making life miserable for me but I don't want to leave due to child.

My partner and I both work shifts in the hospital. We’ve been together for seven years and have a six-year-old child. She has BPD, which adds to the challenges.

I'm at my breaking point after putting up with so much over the years. I’m generally healthy, but over the past year, I’ve noticed changes in my bowel habits and some worrying red flags that I ignored. On Tuesday, I had more concerning symptoms, so I finally booked a colonoscopy.

That day, while my child was at school and my partner was at work, I spent the day arranging everything—doctor’s appointment, blood tests, insurance—and scheduled the colonoscopy for Thursday. Then, I picked up my child from school, fed her, did homework, gave her a bath, and put her to bed.

My partner, meanwhile, has a 4,000-word essay due and wants me to write it for her. When she came home from work, she was angry that I hadn’t started it yet. I’ve told her I’ll help, but I’m not going to do the entire essay, which she’s unhappy about.

Thursday came, and after dropping my child off at school, I rushed to central London for my colonoscopy. Afterward, the hospital wouldn’t let me leave on my own due to the anaesthetic, so I arranged for a friend from work to pick me up. I planned to get home by taxi or train in time to pick up my child from school since my parents are away on holiday.

 But my partner came home around lunchtime because she had a cough and wasn’t feeling well. I was still drowsy, so I sat and had coffee with my friend near the hospital for about 40 minutes, assuming my partner could pick up our child. When I called her, she didn’t want to go because she couldn’t be bothered to do her makeup and was upset that I had stayed for coffee.

So, I called the school to ask if they could keep my child an extra 30 minutes. Then I rushed home, picked her up, brought her home, fed her, took her to art class, and brought her back. This was all after having anaesthetic and a scope up my backside just a few hours earlier.

Today, my partner is shouting and swearing at me because I won’t do her essay. Again, I said I’d help, but I’m not doing it for her. Part of the reason is that I’ve done them for her in the past when she was in nursing school, and she screamed at me when she didn’t like the feedback.

Last week, my partner had a day off, and I was scheduled to work from 4 pm to 1 am. I’d get home around 1:30 am, shower, eat, and usually wouldn’t fall asleep until 4 am due to the intensity of working in the ER/ED/A&E. That morning, our child needed to be dropped at school, and although my partner got her ready, I asked if she could drop her off so I could sleep a little longer. She refused, saying I wasn’t working until 4 pm, so there was no reason I couldn’t take her.

I contribute about 85% of the household income and work myself to exhaustion, all while managing most of the responsibilities at home (buy my partner cleans more than me but she does not cook). My parents and I organize most of the childcare, but my partner won’t give me access to her rota. Occasionally, she sends me screenshots, but it changes all the time, making things more difficult because I can’t really rely on her. If my parents go on holiday (they’re retired), she gets angry because it complicates childcare. Yet, I’m the one who usually has to cancel or rearrange my shifts. To her credit, she does try to help when things get really tough.

Now I don't want to leave because I want my kid to have 2 parents, I come from a state family with 2 parents and my partner from a broken home. I don't want this for my child.

For context this behaviour is a huge improvement on where she was a few years ago due to therapy

It’s common in the city where I live for people to meet up for drinks as a casual date. I have no problem with that, and I honestly really like the vibe of drinks date. It’s got the casual, low-pressure vibe of a coffee date without being lame or during the day but with the ambiance and romantic vibe of a dinner date without the pressure or heft bill of a dinner date.

The catch is that I don’t plan to drink on any of these dates. It’s not that I don’t love drinks (I do! lol) but at this point in my life, I only really drink on special occasions. I’m very committed to my work, health, and fitness, I just don’t have room in my life for weeknight cocktails anymore. My body just can’t run like that anymore 😂

The only night of the week I’m ever able to drink alcohol is Saturday nights because Sundays are usually clear for me. But even then I’m choosy because, if I’m going to put myself through a potential hangover, I want it to be for a good reason lol. A birthday, a wedding, a special occasion, a celebration, vacations, etc. not just a regular Saturday night.

The other reason is that I also don’t like to incorporate alcohol into my dating life until I know the person better. I’d like to get to know them as my unvarnished self before introducing booze to the mix.

I have no problem if the guy wants to have a drink on the date! (Given that he’s an adult and can handle his alcohol) but I find that if I don’t drink, they feel a little awkward about being the only one drinking and seem a little turned off that I accepted a drinks date only to stay sober (I usually order a mocktail and apps). I once “pretended” to order a drink just to get the guy off my back (order a tequila soda and then privately asked the bartender to just make it a club soda) but that seems like a silly solution.

If I mention ahead of time that I don’t plan to drink, the guy sometimes interprets like I’m trying to squeeze a dinner date out of him, which isn’t true.

This is suppose to be a POV of someone posting a story to reddit of how his girlfriend cheated on him. And the unpredicted events that followed. It is a bit long, so I have to post it in three parts over the course of the next couple days. Again, this is my first work, so please be gentle with your critiques. I hope you enjoy.

  
**My girlfriend of one year cheated on me. I never predicted what would happen next.**

  


This story takes place over the course of several years. So it’s a bit long. Please be patient with me.



So, before I go into this story I need to lay out some history in order to create some context. Pretty much my entire life I have suffered from bad depression and social anxiety. I am now 38, but when I was 30 I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it is a personality disorder that results in someone having a very hard time regulating their emotions. It’s believed to have stemmed from some form of childhood trauma or abandonment. It usually results in impulsive behavior, emotional outbursts, a lack of self identity and a pattern of unhealthy and unstable relationships, be it friends or romantic relationships. For those of you who do know what it is, please don’t villainize it. I can guarantee you that whoever you knew that had it has been struggling emotionally far longer than you know. And also more than likely severely regrets whatever they did in order to ruin the relationship. They more than likely have not reached out to mend things because of embarrassment or a fear of rejection.

Okay, now that we have that out of the way, onto the story. So I met Sarah roughly 4 years ago. My friend Ali, who I had not talked to in several years, had reached out and wanted to check in on me. I was surprised since I was just under the assumption they were tired of my mood swings and decided to cut me out of their lives for good. She wanted to know how I was doing and if I wanted to come to a party they were having at their place this weekend. We talked for a bit and I let her know things had been a bit rough. 

At this point my depression was so bad that I never did anything except go to work and come home. I did not talk to anyone or hangout with anyone. I was all alone. So at the urging of my therapist, I accepted the invitation.

That weekend Ali’s husband, James, came and picked me up and took me back to their place. The party had not started yet, but there were a few familiar faces, and there was definitely one I had never seen before. It was Sarah. Now right off the bat I was very intimidated by her, because she was absolutely gorgeous! I mean in my head she was miles out of my league. Everyone I knew was happy to see me and they all gave me hugs, it felt good, but awkward. I was introduced to Sarah. She was a friend of someone I knew and it was actually her first time at Ali and Jame’s house. She looked at me, smiled and said hi. I said hi back but then quickly looked away. I was too nervous. After a little while more people showed up and the party was underway. 

Now everyone I knew drank, and to excess. But I had quit drinking years before. So being basically the only sober person at the party was…well weird and a bit uncomfortable. See I’m not a fan of small, cramped and loud spaces. And that’s what the inside of their house felt like. So after a while, when I was feeling overwhelmed, I stepped outside and sat at a table in their backyard. After about 10 minutes or so of trying to decompress, I heard the door open and then close. I turned to see who it was, and it was Sarah. She walked up to the table and asked if she could join me. I was super nervous, and sadly, a bit skeptical. My past relationships, platonic and romantic, had left me constantly on edge and a bit mistrusting. But I said it was no problem and she sat down. She asked me how I knew everyone, and I told her I have known Ali since I was 18, and I met everyone through her. But we don't talk as much these days. She asked me why, but I deflected the question. We just continued to sit there talking. The longer it went on, the more relaxed I was becoming. After what felt like 5 minutes, but was actually an hour, Ali came out to see where I had gone and found me and Sarah talking. She asked if everything was okay and I told her it was, I just was decompressing from feeling overstimulated inside. After that Sarah excused herself and went inside. I followed shortly after.

I stayed at the party until about midnight. That was when my social meter just hit zero, and I had to head home. Everyone else was drunk, so I needed to call an Uber to take me home. I said my goodbyes to anyone who was coherent enough to understand, and I stepped out front to wait for my ride. I didn’t even notice but Sarah came up from behind and sat down next to me. She asked what I was doing, so I told her. I commented on how she didn’t seem as drunk as everyone else. She explained that while she did drink, she wasn’t a real heavy drinker. This immediately appealed to me. We kept talking until my Uber showed up. I told her to have a good night and went home. 

The next day I was off work, just sitting at home drinking my coffee when I got a text. Which was weird because I never got texts. And what was weirder was that it was a number I didn’t know. Turns out it was Sarah. She said she enjoyed talking to me, so she got my number from Ali. Again I was skeptical of her. Why would she want to talk to me? I was no one interesting or special. I didn’t get it. 

I responded and we just spent the next hour or so texting back and forth just talking about nothing. I had noticed the night before that she just seemed like someone who was really easy to talk to, and it was only proven today. So over the course of the next several weeks this became a daily thing. We would text back and forth most of the day. Eventually she asked if I wanted to go grab a coffee sometime. I reluctantly agreed. We met up at a local cafe and spent the next two hours just talking and laughing. It was during this conversation that my BPD got brought up. She told me that she actually had an aunt who had BPD, and she understood how difficult it is to live with. That made me feel relieved. She told me about how things had been a bit rough for her lately as well. Her apartment ended up having black mold, so she had to move out. But then she was laid off from her job. So she was staying with her mom till she got back on her feet. 

So, Sarah and I became fast friends. Now, I have a problem where when a pretty girl shows me positive attention, I tend to over analyze and overthink everything. And I definitely did that with Sarah. I had developed this huge crush on her, and it was probably very obvious. And between my constantly shifting emotions and the overthinking things, I from time to time would have breakdowns. It had been three months since Sarah and I had met. And that is when my breakdowns tend to happen the most. And like clockwork, they did. I would get jealous of other guys, but keep it to myself. I would think that her and other people were only spending time with me because they had pity for me. That she was talking bad about me behind my back. 

One day Sarah could see that I was feeling extra emotional that day. She asked me what was wrong and I told her it was nothing. She insisted I talk about it. And after some back and forth I gave in. I told her about all the thoughts and feelings I was having. I left out the part about me having a crush on her, but other than that, I spilled my purse out on her doorstep. After I was done she kind of just sat there staring at me. It went on for what felt like forever. Then she reached out and pulled me in for a huge hug. It kinda freaked me out and tried to jump back, but she just grabbed me and pulled me in tightly. She told me that she would never do that to me and she knew that what I was feeling was not my actual feelings, but my trauma coming to the surface. Now, if I didn’t have a crush on this girl before, I certainly did now! 

Now Sarah and I were spending most of our time together. We had become best friends, and way faster than either of us had expected. She brought me over to meet her mom, who basically became the mom I never had. My relationship with my parents was not great. I had not spoken to either of them in years. But her mom welcomed me with open arms. She always had me over for dinner and insisted that I come over for holidays and other gatherings. She treated me like a son, and I can honestly say that I loved her. 

Because of my time with Sarah, and the regular therapy I was attending, I was starting to notice a difference in my emotions. I was feeling a lot more stable. I didn’t immediately go to negative thoughts anymore. I got more comfortable in social settings. She even invited me to meet several of her friends, and they welcomed me into their friend group right away. I was starting to feel more confident and was starting to see some value in myself, but there was still a long way to go. 

About 8 months into hanging out we were on a camping trip with some friends. It was dark and we were sitting around the fire. Sarah and I, since we had become so close, did occasionally have cute little physical contact moments, that at the time I thought they were innocent. I still thought she was out of my league, so I never tried anything. And since she never approached me, I took that as validation that she was not interested in me that way. But while we were sitting around the fire, she moved closer to me and put her head on my shoulder. It was at this moment that I knew I was in trouble. I had come to fall in love with her. I sat by the fire smiling, but was screaming in my head. “What are you doing!! She is your best friend. You can’t be in love with her”. I sat on those feelings for maybe a week or so before I decided that it was best to pack them up and throw them in mental storage. 

At about 11 months I was hanging out with some new friends I met through Sarah named Mark and Danielle. They had been together for nearly 10 years, but were not married and had no kids. They were really interesting people and very down to earth. They had become the people I grew closest to out of all of Sarah’s friends. Danielle had been one of Sarah’s oldest and closest friends. Now one night the three of us are sitting in their garage, and out of nowhere Mark looks at me and says “You’re in love with Sarah, aren’t you?” Danielle looked at me smiling. I was a little shocked that they just asked me point blank. I stumbled over my words a bit, but I denied that I did. They both just stared at me with looks that said they weren’t buying it. I denied it again, but they just kept staring. Finally I sighed and said “ is it that obvious?” They said “only when you look at her.” My head fell into my hands. I was so embarrassed. They asked why I hadn’t asked her out yet. And I told them because I thought she was way out of my league. That we were best friends, and I accepted that was as far as it would go. Danielle, again point blank, just said “you know she is crazy about you too, right?” I didn’t believe her. I said she was crazy for even thinking that. While I had become more confident in the last several months, I was still working through some things. Mark chimed in and said “seriously. She is really into you. You haven’t noticed the way she looks at you?” I said “yeah, as a friend”. They both groaned. They told me that I should shoot my shot. That they guaranteed that she would say yes if I asked her out. I told them I would think about it. And I did. I spent the next two weeks with only that on my mind. I even hung out with Sarah less those two weeks because I needed to sort out my thoughts and feelings.

Finally I made a decision, I was going to ask her out. Mark and Danielle were good people, why would they lie to me? I had not seen or talked to Sarah in 4 days, which was weird for us. But I texted her and asked her if she wanted to meet up. She agreed immediately. We met up at that local cafe again. We were sitting and talking. Me with a lead ball in my throat and a million butterflies in my stomach. I couldn’t stop fidgeting. I was so nervous. Obviously Sarah could see something was up, and asked if there was something wrong. I didn’t answer for a second, then looked at her and said that I had something on my mind. Something that had been bothering me for a couple weeks now. And I needed an answer. She looked at me strangely but asked what I needed to know. I hesitated for a moment, but then I just came out and said it. I asked her out. I have never seen a smile so big. She raised her fists and said “finally!!!”. I must have looked shocked, because she giggled when she looked at me and said she had been waiting for me to do that for forever. I asked her if she was so interested, why didn’t she approach me. She said that she knew that I was hesitant to date because of my BPD. So she wanted to respect that. But as time went on she saw me becoming healthier and more stable. And it was then that she hoped I would be ready to ask her out. But I never did, so she thought I just still wasn’t ready. She wanted the ball in my court so that way I could date when I actually felt ready for it. I was so confused. Not by what she said, that made sense, and I thought it was sweet. I was confused because I never in a million years would have thought she would be interested in me like that. She reached out and grabbed my hands with hers, stared right into my eyes and said that she would love to go out with me. I was still confused, but it was a happy confusion. I thought hey it might not make sense, but she likes me, and that’s what matters. So we started dating. 

Okay, now fast forward to a little over a year later. Sarah was still technically living with her mom, but she basically lived with me. I had started to notice that Sarah was acting a bit off recently. I first noticed because she had trouble keeping eye contact, and she never had a problem doing that. I still had problems with overthinking things so I figured I was just being paranoid for no reason and brushed it off. But then she started to talk less, sat a bit further away on the couch. While we usually had sex about 5 times a week, that had dropped to pretty much nothing. And she just kind of had this look of guilt in her eyes. I tried bringing it up, but she said it was nothing and went back to playing candy crush. I could tell something was wrong. A couple days later we were in bed when I turned to her and just asked, are you cheating on me? For a second her eyes got so wide! But as she turned to look at me her face contorted into an almost insulted look. She said she couldn’t even believe I was asking her that. I said that I noticed her behavior lately and I could tell something was wrong. She again said it was nothing, and that I was probably overthinking things like I had a habit of doing. This got under my skin a bit. I told her to cut the shit and tell me what was going on. I told her I saw how scared she looked when I asked her, which to me was an admission of guilt. She started to stammer but she denied it again. I just got out of bed and told her this is her last chance to come clean. If she didn’t then I would just end the relationship right now. She broke down and started to cry. I had expected this. She said she was so sorry. That it only happened once a couple of weeks ago. Which added up because that’s when her behavior started to change. She said she didn’t know why she did it. That it was a mistake and she was so sorry. I asked who it was, and she said it was our friend Josh. 

Now I never really liked Josh. Sarah was good friends with his wife Stacy, so in order to hangout with her, we also had to with Josh. He was cocky, brash and kind of a bully. He really bothered me. So when Sarah said it was him, I was in shock. I asked her why him of all people! I told her she even hated him, so why? She couldn’t give me a reason. She said she didn’t know how or why it even happened. I told her she needed to leave. She had a couple minutes to get her bags packed and out of my apartment. She begged me not to do this. To just talk to her, but I said no. She lost any right to a conversation about us the moment you slept with someone else. She had nothing to say to this. So she just continued to cry and pack a couple bags. When she reached the door I told her to stop, and sit on the couch. She looked confused, but she did. I told her to wait a minute. I went into my room and grabbed a decently sized box. I came out and put the box on the coffee table. Sarah obviously was wondering what the box was about, but she didn’t ask. I asked her if this had anything to do with our conversation about marriage last month? 

See, I am not really one for marriage. My parents were divorced and I know how messy it can be. And while I’m not a pessimist, I understand that the reality is that no couple is guaranteed to stay together forever. So why get married if by chance we end up splitting up one day. Wouldn’t it be easier to just break up than go through a divorce. Sarah did want to get married one day. She said she understood my position, but she loved the idea of two people enjoying a celebration to share their love with their closest friends and family. That to get married was the greatest display of two peoples' love. We talked for a while just bouncing ideas and thoughts off each other. We normally had great communication. We tried our best to not get into arguments, and instead try to understand where each person was coming from, and would figure out a compromise that worked for us both. That’s not to say that we didn’t have our arguments. Sometimes, those just can’t be avoided. So I told her that while I was not the biggest fan of marriage, I was still open to the idea and would think about it. 

So, I asked Sarah if it had anything to do with our talk about marriage last month, and she said that could have been a contributing factor. She just felt disappointed that we didn’t share the same feelings on marriage. She started to question if this was actually going to go anywhere, and it made her start to feel bad and unwanted. I told her that I was open to the idea, and would think about it. So why did it seem like she took my response as a direct no? She said she didn’t know. For some reason she just couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t going to change my feelings on the matter.

It was at this time I slid the box over to her. She just looked at me and I told her to open it. She did and inside was another box. Again she looked at me confused, then pulled out that box and opened it. There was another box. It was basically a nesting dolls box. Sarah had some weird love of nesting dolls, I never understood it, but it was her thing. She did this about three more times until she opened the last box, and inside was a jewelry box. She dropped it on the table and whipped her head around to face me, all wide eyed and in utter disbelief. I told her that I had thought about it and came to a decision. That it didn’t matter how I spent the rest of my life with her, just that I did. And if marriage was really important to her, I would step out of my comfort zone to make her happy. Tears welled up in her eyes even more. She started crying even harder now. I said that I had planned on marrying you, but you ruined that. Your doubts and lack of trust had now ruined our future together. I wanted her to feel the same hurt she made me feel. So I had decided that before she left, what better way to jab the dagger in than to show her that I had planned on giving her exactly what she wanted. I got up from the couch, went to the door, opened it and told her to get out. Still crying, she slowly got up, and walked out of my apartment, defeated. I made sure to slam the door behind her and locked it.  Right after she left I called Stacy and told her what Sarah and her husband had done. Stacy was pissed. She had suspected that Josh had been cheating on her for a while now. I told her then Sarah might not have been the only one then as this just happened a couple weeks ago. She just screamed and hung up the phone. 

A little while later Sarah’s mom called me asking what happened. She said Sarah came home and just went straight to her room crying. And how she has just been sobbing nonstop. I told her about how Sarah had cheated on me. Her mom didn’t believe me. I told her how I confronted Sarah tonight about it. It took some work, but I got her to admit to it. Her mom asked me, ""What about the proposal?"" I had made her mom aware of what I had planned on doing. She even helped me pick out the ring. I told her there was no longer a proposal. I told her that I told Sarah about the proposal, just so she knew what she lost. Her mom was upset, but definitely not with me. She said that she loves me and understands my decision. That it will be a shame to no longer see me coming over for dinner and spending time with the family. I said I would miss her too and that I loved her. I hung up and tried to go to sleep. 

A couple weeks later her mom called me again and said that Sarah was doing terribly. She wouldn’t eat, she couldn’t sleep. She just laid in bed all day crying. She had gotten fired from her job for not showing up. That her life was a mess because of what she had done, and wanted to know if I would be willing to talk to her. She said Sarah didn’t know that she was calling, so whatever my decision, it would stay between the two of us. Now, I won’t lie, it broke my heart to hear all that. There was still part of me that would always love her. I mean, I really felt like she saved my life. If I had never met her, I might never have become the healthy person I was today. I told her mom that while that was really sad to hear, I just couldn’t face her. Her mom said she understood. I did say to her though that I had a message for Sarah. I told her that if she really does care about me, then for me, she should eat, sleep and start prioritizing her own personal health. Her mother said that I was a good man and that she will miss me. We said our goodbyes and that was it. They never reached out after that. 

The first three months after the break up were rough. I was sad and depressed. I stayed inside all day. Even considered drinking again. But I resisted. After a while people started showing up at my door and insisting I come over to their place. That it would be good for me to get out and socialize. So I did. Now these were actually Sarah’s friends originally. But I had grown real close with them as well. And they were all actually very upset with Sarah for what she did. Most of them had stopped talking to her. I know that Danielle had tried to reach out, but just got nothing back in response. So she gave up. After that third month, things started to get better. I was getting out of the house more. Spending more time with friends. Was starting to smile and laugh again. I still felt like a piece of me was missing, but at least I wasn’t moping about all day anymore. ",2,1728163518.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

It's been years since i am working on having my own perfect diet, and to be free from suffering. I couldn't take it no more.

I might have achieve my goal, at 52 years old. Years of food journaling, tests, mono diets, trials and errors, hospital stays, meds, specialists. I did so much, i kind of consider myself as a GERD expert lol. I'm grateful that i have managed to identify all my real triggers, but at the end of the day, it was a lot of sacrifices. I'm working with a dietician at the hospital so i don't have any problems meeting my nutritional needs. I could finally say goodbye to the meds, after years of daily usage that left me with some consequences....

So here's the list of all the food i had to give up for good, so i don't have a single flare up anymore, and preserve what's left of my poor damaged esophagus:

Meat (all of it made me sick) dairy, oats, oils, all liquid fats including all nut butters, all spices, all citrus fruits, tomatoes, avocados, coconut, egg yolks, all processed foods, ketchup, mustard, vinegars, wheat, artificial sweeteners, carbonated water, coffee, tea, mint, cranberries, garlic, onions, leeks, kiwis, raspberries, mangoes, cocoa powder, carob powder, chocolate, apple sauce, salmon, canned fish, all nuts, cinnamon, ginger, and even my vitamin D supplement was a trigger ( had to switch to a powdered brand without lanolin or soy oil), mouthwash and mint toothpaste, and a plant based protein powder i loved. 

I also had to reduce my portion sizes considerably, and skip most snacks ( except the post training one in the morning) AND very importantly for me, reduce the amount of water at certain times of the day. I also now eat nothing after 6 pm, and drink fennel tea after each meal. I chew my food like a cow. lol...

I am now used to my routine, i don't miss the food i gave up anymore and i even managed to make recipes i enjoy, with the flavours i can still use ( herbs, miso, tamari sauce, turmeric ( tiny amount), black salt, etc. Basically, i eat plant based, like a Korean ( several small meals in bowls) with the exception of egg whites and some white fish. All the rest is plant based, virtually fat free. 

I'm sharing it because, i'm proud of myself, my efforts, my resilience. Many would have given up. But i had a goal in mind and i never forgot about it. The hardest to give up for me was peanut butter. I even tried the powdered one ( PB and Me) and it was a very big no. My diet is very rich in fibre, low fat proteins i can tolerate, legumes, whole grains and it is now satisfying. I found my balance, i don't wake up in the middle of the night anymore, i don't have to starve because i'm too hurt. Even the meds, and we tried so many, did no good to me plus all the side effects. It was the best decision to focus on the diet and the lifestyle, for me. Thanks for reading!!! :)",3,1728163205.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

Huel black

2 huel bars

2 serving of huel hot and savory

2 cup coffee

mixed nuts 200 calories

this is close to 2000 calories. 

  
First few days were ok but then I started to feel warm inside. too many hot farts at night. I also noticed that my skin isnt looking as healthy as earlier. Mornings were biggest trouble. too much sticky stool. 

At this point i added 2 apples to the diet replacing 1 huel bar. It felt good eating something organic. Apples became my favorite meal of the day. But things did not improve much. Hot feeling in belly, hot farts and sticky stool continued.

At this point I cut down 1 serving of huel hot and savory and replaced it with kachava shake. Kachava tasted much more natural than huel hot and savory. But still nothing much changed. 

At this point I decided to start eating some salad and replaced huel black with a salad sub. Things started to get much better. First time stool was smooth. Hot farts and hot feeling in belly continued though.

At this point I decided to replace huel black and 2nd huel hot and savory with a protein shake and some lentils and ancient grains that I used to eat before getting huel. My belly never felt so good. I am not using huel anymore except 1 huel bar.

I really contemplated about actually writing a review, because Travis Baldree’s books are so well-known in this community, I believe almost everyone will know/have read them. But alas, I’ll make a few comments.

*Legends and Lattes* is the story of former orc mercenary Viv, who abandons her old life to open a coffee shop in a small town, and meets a colorful cast of new acquaintances that soon become her friends.

What else can I say other than that the book is a classic cozy: lots of descriptions of the characters slowly building the shop, calm scenes of coffee-drinking and personal growth. The story did have stakes, and I must say, the scenes where >!Fennus burned the coffee shop were heart-wrenching, after seeing all that love that went into its creation!<. But I believe the ending was entirely satisfactory.

Apparently, I bought the second edition of this book, which also included a short story called *Pages to Fill*, showing us a scene of Viv’s old life as a mercenary, hunting a shapeshifting thief with her crew. This was much more action-filled than the main story, but it was well-written and it established some more details about the L&L story.

I think that, more than everything, L&L shows that ultimately, the meaning of life is in the small things: not in grand adventures and endless riches, but in friendship, community, creation and love. Such values are a lot of times missed or not strongly represented in modern fiction and fantasy imo, and its good that such stories exist to remind us that.

I’ve also bought the sequel (or prequel? I forget), *Bookshops and Bonedust*, and I’ll probably write a few things about it as well, after I finish it.

It may seem stupid, but the visual chaos of seeing rows of books in different heights and widths continues to bother me. Surely I am not the only one? I don’t understand the point of making books all these different sizes. They should all be uniform (like CD cases and vinyl records as an example). I understand thickness because some books are longer or shorter than others. But I wish height and width would be standardized.

Of course there are exceptions, like coffee table books, technical manuals, textbooks, map books, etc. But our everyday reading material should be the same standard size.

If anyone would like to read more, let me know in the comments. Thanks! All feedback is appreciated. I'm copying and pasting this directly from Scrivner so if the format is weird, I apologize! 

  
**Prologue**



The barrel cracked on impact as it was thrown overboard. A bright yellow liquid oozed out, emitting a horrid smell. It was so toxic that it could kill any animal that came into contact with it.

The ship had a crew of fifteen men. Once a year in the middle of the night, they sailed out a mile, where they disposed of two dozen barrels of toxic waste. The waste would harm the bay, kill sea life, and leave the local fishing industry in shambles for months, wondering why more than half the fish they brought in were dead. 

Their location was the Monterey Bay. A marine sanctuary that went up and down the coast, spanning a total of two hundred and seventy-six miles. It was home to several endangered species and was known for its unique canyon that reached depths of up to eleven thousand feet. The sprawling ecosystem was now at risk. A company was cutting corners and experimenting with projects that were kept under wraps from the public. 

The men on board understood the severity of the job, but the cash offered kept them silent. Ben, the youngest of the men on board, was upset with himself for having to take the job for the second year in a row. He had hoped with his day job he wouldn’t have to worry about his finances, but life got the better of him and he needed the money. If he played his cards right, he’d be promoted in a few months and wouldn’t have to take the job again. 

He found himself having the focus on keeping his balance as the ship began to rock from the large waves. It was a struggle. A storm was approaching the coast from the west. There were rumblings that it would cause historic flooding not seen in twenty years. It had the crew questioning if they should cut their losses and return after the storm passed. 

Another two barrels were tossed, and it was decided. They called it for the night. The weather was ruthless, unpredictable, and if the ship didn’t return to shore soon, the men worried they may not make it back.

A massive wall of water came out of nowhere and slammed into the side of the ship, sending one of the men over the ship’s railing. Ben was quick. He gripped the man’s arms just in time and pulled him back over with every ounce of strength he had. The man sputtered out a thank you.  

One of the older crewmen yelled out, pointing towards the bow of the ship. 

Ben squinted. It was too dark to see much of anything. “What is it?”

“There’s something out there. Something big,” said the old man. He had a ghastly look of terror across his face, was visibly shaking, and stepped as far back from where he had pointed as possible. 

Ben was alarmed. He didn’t know if there was something out there, or if the man was hallucinating. For their sake, he hoped the man was exhausted and his mind was playing tricks on him, brought on by the stress of working in such harsh conditions. 

A shudder rippled throughout the ship that sent the crew falling across the deck. It wasn’t a wave. For the last hour, something had been lurking and stalking them from a distance. 

The men ran to the edge of the ship, trying to see beyond the waves to understand what had hit them. Ben’s first thought was a whale. He’d heard that whales had been attacking ships in recent months and thought it was possible they may have hit one when they were tossing the barrels and pissed it off. 

It was dark, but Ben swore he saw the color of the yellow liquid from the barrels beneath the waves. That’s weird, he thought to himself. He didn’t understand how the waste could be so close to the surface. It was made from dense chemicals that should have caused it to sink. 

His eyes widened, and everything seemed to slow down. Screams from the surrounding crew echoed in his ears. The last thing he saw was a jaw of serrated teeth bigger than the circumference of a bus rising from below, headed straight for him. 

**Chapter 1**

“That’s what it’s called, Frank. An atmospheric river. You can’t expect Raven and I to work with this going on, it’s dangerous,” said Cam as she grabbed the remote on the counter and turned the volume down on the TV where she had been watching the local news which informed her that the storm hitting the coast was much bigger than the city was equipped to handle. 

“Yes, that’s exactly what I expect,” said Frank. “The waves are going to be higher than they’ve been in years. That means more tourists, surfers, and photographers. I bet they all love coffee. We can’t miss an opportunity like that.”

“You mean you can’t miss an opportunity like that?” Cam waited for Frank to respond, but he stayed silent. “If you were here right now to see the weather instead of out of town on vacation, I guarantee you’d change your mind, and if that wasn’t enough, did you know the Marine institute is telling everyone to stay out of the water? They’re investigating that tower company for dumping waste into the bay. With all of those missing boats over the last year, I bet you fifty bucks it’s connected.” 

Frank’s tone dropped. “Can you, or can you not handle running the shop today, Camille?”

Cam’s full name was Camille, but no one called her that. Not even her parents. She told Frank early on to call her by her nickname, and he proceeded to do the opposite. Cam knew he did it as a power trip, to make her feel inferior. 

“It’s only been two months since you were promoted to shift lead,” he paused to let the words sink in. “If you think you can’t handle it, I would like to know.”

Her stomach dropped, patience hanging by a thread.

“Some people aren’t capable of handling the pressure of that position, in which case…”

 “I was more than capable five years ago when you decided to open up a coffee shop. You and I both know you’re lucky you found me. From what I remember, you didn’t know a single thing about coffee, let alone your way around an espresso machine,” said Cam. 

Frank stayed silent.

“I’ve helped you for years. I should have been a shift lead the moment the shop opened. In fact, I should be manager at this point, not a lead.” Cam didn’t normally speak back to Frank, so she was surprised by herself. “For you to even question if I’m capable makes me want to…”

“I hear you, Camille,” said Frank. “Look, if you keep the shop running and tourists happy, well, then I’m willing to talk to you about taking on a bigger role in the shop. Officially.” 

She waited, still not happy with his response. 

“With a raise,” he added. 

“Oh? How much?”

“I’d rather not go into specifics now, but I’m willing to give you around a dollar,” he said.

“A whole dollar. You’re too kind.”

“Get to work, Camille. I’ll check in with you and the team later.” Before she could fire back, he ended the call. 

Cam knew going to work and opening up the coffee shop for the day was a bad idea. Frank was an idiot. He didn’t know anything. But despite that, she was going to do as he said because she was stubborn and wanted to prove she could handle it. 

“This better be worth it,” she said to herself while reaching for her work sweater that had the coffee shop’s logo on it. It was a cozy sweater that she loved wearing on cold days, but it wasn’t going to be enough to handle the storm outside, so she quickly put it on, then grabbed a rain jacket out of her closet. She picked up her breakfast sandwich as she walked back into her tiny kitchen and took a quick bite, then reached for her keys on the table and rushed out the front door.

\~

Cam lived only a ten-minute bike ride from work, right off of West Cliff Drive. Because of the current weather, it would have been wise to drive to work, but Cam didn’t have a car and didn’t see the point of adding on a car payment when she couldn’t afford it. Most of the homes on West Cliff were worth millions. Never in her wildest dreams did she think she’d be able to afford one of them. When she was eighteen, looking to move out of her family home, she had a bit of luck. She befriended a regular at her previous job that quickly became one of her favorite customers. That customer happened to have a studio that was empty. When Cam asked, the old lady agreed to let her rent it. It was a small space, but Cam was given a good deal. She’d been living there for five years now. Part of her wanted to move out and start fresh in a new city, but the comfort and security of her job held her back. 

She enjoyed the ride across West Cliff. The cliff had a drop of anywhere between twenty to forty feet. The scenery was stunning, with a breathtaking view of the sea and a bike path that was always packed with people on their daily runs. But today was different. The path was empty and rain pummeled the ground. Cam’s bike was barely able to withstand the crushing force of the wind. On a regular day, she biked one handed to work while she enjoyed her breakfast with the other hand, but today her sandwich was blown right out of her hand the moment she walked out of her front door. Even with both hands on the handlebars, it was a struggle to keep the bike steady. It was as if the wind was trying its best to get her to turn around and go home. 

\~

The city of Santa Cruz was a popular tourist destination due to its gorgeous coastline, surf culture, and the iconic boardwalk. Despite the comfort and security that Cam felt in her hometown, she felt trapped. People dreamed about living on the coast of California. She was aware and grateful, but she knew she let herself get into a tricky situation at her job and soon would have to leave, or she feared she’d never have the courage to move on with her life. Cam’s parents wanted her to go to school, but Cam wasn’t interested. School was too expensive, and she didn’t want the debt. If she wasn’t going to be guaranteed a livable wage after college, which included the bare minimum of having enough to pay rent, buy food, and live comfortably, then what was the point? 

She dreamed of being the owner of her own coffee shop. That was why she dedicated so many years into Meg’s Coffee. She hoped that with the experience she was gaining, it would help her in investing in her own place when the time was right. 

Her friends and family had told her she was wasting her time. It had been five years and Cam was promoted to shift lead only three weeks ago. If she had been working at any other coffee shop, she would have been on her way to a management position by now. She knew was being taken advantage of, but she stayed. 

There wasn’t a day that went by that she didn’t daydream about leaving her job. She imagined a rude tourist approaching her at the register with a complaint, but that would be the final straw. She’d tell them to make their own drink. Her apron would get thrown to the ground, and she’d walk right out of the shop with her coworkers cheering her on. If only, she thought to herself.

The battle against the wind was brutal, but she continued along West Cliff and made her way down the hill, quickly approaching Beach Street. She slowed down the best she could at the bottom and turned right, peddling her way to the pier along the sidewalk connecting to the Boardwalk. Far in the distance, Cam could make out a group of surfers through the choppy waves. Surfers dreamed of getting to tackle waves that big, but the waves looked menacing, and they were only going to get worse. Most of the surfers out there had been surfing their whole lives, so they knew what they were doing, but mother nature can take out even the most experienced surfers. Cam could understand the thrill, excitement, and prestige behind getting to surf waves that big, but it wasn’t worth it. No, thank you.

“Watch out!” someone yelled, prompting Cam to press the brakes. The sidewalk was wet, so there wasn’t much she could do. She immediately lost control of the bike. Instinct took over. Her bike was going down, and she was going right along with it. Cam was able to pull her body inward, bringing her arms up in an attempt to protect her face. The impact wasn’t as bad as she thought it would be, but she still had the wind knocked out of her. She hadn’t been wearing a helmet, so she was lucky she didn’t hit her head. Her hands and knees took most of the damage. 

She stood up with a slight limp. A car was driving down the road and had almost run her over. They had been speeding, and because of the weather, they didn’t notice her biking along the side of the road until the last moment. Instead of stopping to make sure she was fine, they sped away. “Idiots!” There was no way they could hear her, but she had to let out her frustration and continued to curse. 

Cam had yet to arrive at work, but she already felt done with the day. She wanted to bike back home, go to bed, and try again tomorrow. In an ideal world, that’s what she would do, but she knew Frank wouldn’t let her. A day would come when she’d build up the courage to tell Frank to shove it. She’d look him directly in the eye with a smile on her face and say, “I quit.”

Ignoring the burning sensation coming from the cuts on her knees, she inspected her bike. It looked perfectly fine. If only she could say the same thing about herself. Her clothes had gotten wet, sure, but she knew they would dry throughout the day. What she couldn’t quite fix was the mud that was now smeared all over her jeans. I need coffee. Checking the surrounding road to make sure there weren’t any more crazy drivers, she got back on her bike and made her way down the creaky old pier. 

\~

The first thing Cam saw while biking along the pier was that the wind had caused quite a mess. On the ground, Cam saw a giant poster declaring the wharf’s one hundred and tenth anniversary. The Santa Cruz pier, technically a wharf, was built in 1914. It was used for shipping food and materials, specifically potatoes. After the 1950s rolled around, it turned recreational and became a booming tourist destination. The distance from the beginning of the wharf to its farthest point was half a mile. You were lucky if you drove onto the pier during the weekend and found a place to park. 

People traveled from all over the world just to come and try the seafood. If you were visiting, you were going straight to try the clam chowder. There were many options to pick from. The city even hosted a clam chowder competition once a year. Cam wasn’t much of a seafood fan, so she enjoyed going to Gilda’s and ordering breakfast on her days off from work. 

When you weren’t eating or shopping on the pier, you were watching the sea lions, being serenaded by their barking. She liked to think they were singing. They spent a good part of their day on the beams below the pier and people loved watching them as they laid out, napping on the beams in large groups. But the sea lions and the birds weren’t around today. Not hearing them worried her.

The storm hitting Santa Cruz was incredibly abnormal. A typical day in Santa Cruz usually started with a heavy fog, and then the sunshine pierced through the clouds. The feeling was like a warm, gentle hug. What went perfectly with that feeling was going to the very end of the pier, and visiting Meg’s Coffee for what locals called the best cup of joe around.",1,1728162562.0,writers,3,0.99,False
1fx0f52,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fx0f52,"Marketplace Mall, October 5, 2024.","Following u/Timely_Low5204’s post concerning the Marketplace Mall, I decided to take a trip today to our dead mall to see how it’s faring, out of curiosity. To be honest, I don’t think it’s going to be around much longer. There are a few stores here and there, including JCPenny (which I’m highly surprised is still in operation at that mall). Dick’s Sporting Goods is still there, but they are going to move to the Market Square shopping center on Jefferson Road in a couple of months. IndyCart and Dave and Buster’s are both still at the mall, but I’ve heard they’re moving to the Greece Ridge Mall, although I can’t find any sources that confirm this. 

The food court is completely vacant besides two shops, a coffee shop and an empanada place, although it looked like the empanada place was closed. 

This is just sad man. I honestly thought the U of R expansion would bring new life into the mall but sadly it looks like it wasn’t the case, I mean there’s barely any places to eat in the mall besides the two food court shops mentioned and the various vending machines scattered throughout the place. I used to go to this mall pretty frequently throughout my childhood and it was always packed and I also used to do Christmas shopping with the family here. But, everything good has to come to an end eventually, and I’m sure U of R will just buy out the rest of the mall and turn the whole thing into a giant medical complex. 

Feel free to browse through the photos I took of the mall today. I took more but Reddit wouldn’t allow me to upload more than 20 photos so I’ll probably upload the rest on Imgur or something when I get a chance.",56,1728162517.0,Rochester,30,0.97,False

1fx0cba,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1fx0cba/my_sister_is_trying_to_have_her_son_committed_to/,My sister is trying to have her son committed to a mental health hospital ,"I (38M) need some help. 

My sister (37) has a son (8) that she is trying to have committed long term into a mental health hospital so that she doesn't have to deal with the pesky being a mom thing and I am wondering if there is anything at all I can do to advocate on his behalf.

Backstory:
My sister has no driver's license and has never held a job. She has just found men to cling to and have take care of her until they get fed up and boot her. She currently lives with one of her ex boyfriends and is dating some dude who is our dad's age. More on the living with ex in a minute and why that is. The boyfriend does not like her son and doesn't ever want him around when they are together. My sister used to leave her son with our mom a lot, but she passed away last December so there's not really anyone convenient for my sister to leave him with now. He did spend a lot of time with my brother over the summer, but he has a young child and two step children and it's hard for him and his wife to have our nephew all the time. I live 3 hours away. The ex that she lives with works second shift and often has OT on Saturday so he essentially works 6 days/week. 

The ex is important because he is my nephew's main provider. He was led to believe (as was everyone except my mom) that he was the father of the child. It came out about 4 years ago that he is not when my sister had a cancer scare and was making plans in the event that she died. The bio dad is not in the picture and his only involvement is child support payments. It is my understanding that he has signed away his rights. The ex allows my sister to stay because he cares about and loves my nephew and is afraid of where he and my sister would end up if he kicks her out.

So this morning I my brother and dad both called me saying that my sister is having my nephew sent to a mental health hospital with the intent of him being there long term. Her story is that he fed a cat poison (some kind of cleaning chemical) and killed it. My nephew told me brother that when he woke up the bottle was laying on its side on a coffee table and the cat was on the floor next to the coffee table. He said he woke up his mom when he found this and she immediately jumped to blaming him and accusing him of feeding poison to the cat. I have reached out to the ex to see what he knows and what he thinks happened.

My nephew has never shown any signs of being violent towards animals or humans or anything. He's a normal 8 year old kid. Sure, he's rowdy and loud and mischievous at times, but what kid isn't? My sister has always complained about him over normal kid stuff. She never wanted kids and didn't think she could get pregnant after some medical stuff that happened, so he was a surprise and she's always acted and treated him like an inconvenience.

Is there anything any of us can do to fight for him and on his behalf? The place she has sent him to has awful reviews and horror stories of how they treat kids and just take the parents' word for everything. I'm afraid that if it comes down to his word against hers it isn't going to be good for him. My brother and I both told her we will take him (my wife and I have a 15 yo daughter and 8 yo son, brother has a 21 yo son, 4yo daughter and step kids who are 14 and 11) but my sister doesn't want to surrender her rights because the child support and public aid would go away if she does. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Holy hell that was wild. I should have just canceled this date but then I wouldn't have this train wreck to share with y'all. 

So we agree to meet for coffee at this local place really close by to her. I get there on time and grab a table outside. After 10 minutes I text her where I am (there's no one in the Cafe but me and workers). At the 20 minute mark I decide fuck it, been ghosted again imma grab a tea and bounce. 

I'm like 5 minutes from the place and I get a text, things got crazy at home, she forgot but is walking out the door, she's only a few minutes away. I figure why not I've got nothing else going on today and I spent all this time to look pretty so let's do it. 

She gets there and i offer to buy her drink but she insisted on paying her own because it's going to be pricy. I'm only gonna fight you so much on it so I let her. She got a bubble tea with like 5 add-ins so I figure it's gotta be in the 15$ range compared to my 3$ tea. 

We sit down and she starts talking about work. Tells me her last 5 jobs and goes on about one that paid under the table, boss would sometimes forget to pay her, etc. That goes on for 10 minutes. I sit there for a minute  and finally offer up what I do for work. It's a unique job that used to be the golden goose for people so I'm used to a lot of questions. Nothing.

 I ask her a bit about what she does in her free time. Again i wait to see if she's going to ask about me. Nothing. Tell her I'm a first responder and a docent in animal education, again things people normally have a ton of questions about. Not a word. After a minute of silence she asks me what I do in my freetime like I didn't just tell her that 

I know she went out with friends last night so I ask her about that. 5 minutes of how she got too drunk and told a worker she knows her boyfriend ain't shit and told him he better treat her like the queen she is. Quote

""The most attractive woman I've ever seen in my life, she's got an amazing personality, and she's gorgeous but her boyfriend isn't.""

After a very awkward pause i didn't know what else to say so I asked if she wanted to go for a walk in the nearby park (i pannicked and figured it was better than awkwardly staring at each other). Thankfully she had the good sense to get a text from her mom that she needed to come home immediately. 

Goddamn that was painful. This is why I don't date and figure people just aren't worth the stress. ",31,1728162148.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,8,0.92,False
1fx0adr,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1fx0adr/update_breakfast_and_the_camp_stove/,[UPDATE] breakfast and the camp stove.,"The breakfast was awesome. I drove to Jordan Park. Walked over to the Smith's grocery store and picked up just what I had planned.

Bacon, Brown and serve sausage, 18 eggs, 5 lb potatoes, Bell pepper, red onion, orange juice almond milk, two different kinds of iced coffee mocha and french vanilla and some shredded cheese. 

I took a really long time to cook with that little camp stove but it did its job but I'm surprised how sturdy it was it's a tiny little fold up we're backpacking but it held my cast iron pan in place very well I had to be careful not to knock it over of course but it did marvelous 

I set up in a pavilion that I've seen groups of homeless and before, there was no one there when I started to set up but it didn't take long before a few others came. It was so much fun the food was so good, one of the guys kind of hung out with me and shot the shit and joked a little bit.

They kept thanking me over and over it was really a good morning. When I left I left behind everything that I'd cooked, well most of the food and the drinks I also left my stack of paper plates and the plastic utensils there with instructions to the two that I was sitting with, for them tomake sure that the food got eaten up, to invite other people over and make sure that they could eat as well.

 As I drove off sure enough there was at least three others on the way over to that pavilion to partake in that glorious breakfast. 

It was really such a great feeling. I'm glad I followed through with my plans. 

I wanted to post up pictures but this sub doesn't allow attachments I only took pictures of the food and the stove and the whole little spread not of anybody there I didn't want to make it all weird and awkward.

1fx08lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1fx08lk/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

When I drink more than one coffee or energy drink, I notice I get easily distracted and have a hard time concentrating. It feels like I can focus but am slightly unfocused, if that makes sense. I'll open up the computer and I'll start out feeling ""speedy"" and productive, only to end up with 10 different tabs open doing 5 things at once and jumping between them. I'll also be more forgetful, forgetting what I was doing or losing track of tabs on the computer. Sometimes on caffeine I will also read text or listen to a YouTube video and feel like I can't fully understand it, or it takes more effort for my brain to actually parse and pay attention to the words, almost like a sort of brain fog but with a ""disorganized"" feel to it. I don't know if this could be an indicator of ADHD, or the opposite. I have heard that caffeine typically causes those with ADHD to be more tired and less stimulated, the opposite effect it has on most people, so does this mean that caffeine can cause ADHD-like symptoms in those without it?

This morning I made myself some coffee but hadn't put any creamer in it, and when I sat down to feed the baby I asked if my wife would bring me my coffee. She did ... but didn't notice there was no cream in it. I've never drunk it black, we both always put something in our coffee. I felt so invisible being handed that cup. She's so good with our kids, so attentive, and maybe it was just that she was rushed. But it just made me so sad.

She's admitted that she pulled back from me during my pregnancy because my increased mental illness was hard to deal with. She had to put up a wall to survive. My PPD/PPA was pretty bad too. I don't blame her. We're both in individual therapy and I've changed my meds multiple times to try to find the right balance.

We named recently that our marriage is probably at the lowest point it's ever been, and we both seemed to want to try to fix it, but I just don't know. I don't feel like she likes me anymore. She just always seems annoyed with me. She clearly adores our kids, but the tenderness isn't there with me. She's expressed that she's just touched out at the end of the day, so we don't hold hands or cuddle although I wish we did. I try not to initiate because it hurts too much to get rebuffed. I spend our little alone time after the kids go to bed getting caught up on chores, partly because we need it but maybe also because I knew she didn't want to spend time with me? She watches TV and winds down. Her job is a lot more physically demanding than mine and so I try to do as many house things as I can to let her rest. But it doesn't feel like enough. She often mentions me leaving something somewhere as an annoyance.

I don't blame her, I haven't been easy to be with. I'm just really fucking sad.

I'm not really sure if we'll do anything about it? We're both so exhausted from full time work and kid care that I don't think either of us would date. And neither of us want to give up custody, we both love our kids and generally speaking we parent well together. I don't think we want to get divorced. I just don't know how we'll get back to me believing her when she says ""Love you"" as we fall asleep.",3,1728161587.0,beyondthebump,3,0.67,False
1fx02jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Funfacts_80/comments/1fx02jh/the_geography_of_africa/,The Geography of Africa ,"Africa, the second-largest continent in both land area and population, covers approximately 30.2 million square kilometers, or about 20.4% of the Earth's total land area. Bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Red Sea and Suez Canal to the northeast, Africa is a geographically diverse continent. It is home to a wide range of landscapes, ecosystems, and climatic zones, making it one of the most physically varied regions of the world. This essay explores Africa's key geographic features, including its major landforms, climate zones, rivers, and natural resources.

1. Major Landforms
Africa's topography is marked by several distinct landforms, including deserts, mountains, plateaus, and basins.

Deserts: Africa is home to some of the world's largest deserts. The Sahara Desert in North Africa is the largest hot desert in the world, stretching over 9 million square kilometers. Other notable deserts include the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa and the Namib Desert along the southwestern coast.

Mountains: Africa's mountain ranges, though not as large as those on other continents, are significant. The Atlas Mountains run through Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in the northwest, while the Drakensberg Mountains dominate the eastern part of South Africa. The Ethiopian Highlands and the Eastern Rift Mountains, which include Mount Kilimanjaro (the highest peak in Africa) and Mount Kenya, are also noteworthy features.

Plateaus and Basins: Much of the African continent consists of plateaus, with elevations generally increasing from north to south. These highlands are interspersed with large basins, such as the Congo Basin in central Africa and the Chad Basin in the north-central part of the continent. The basins are often drained by some of Africa's major rivers.

2. Climate Zones
Africa's diverse climate is influenced by its latitude, elevation, and proximity to water bodies. It contains a variety of climate zones, ranging from tropical rainforests to arid deserts.

Equatorial Climate: Found along the equator, this zone is characterized by high temperatures and heavy rainfall throughout the year. The Congo Rainforest, the second-largest tropical rainforest in the world, is located in this region.

Tropical Wet and Dry Climate: Extending from the equatorial regions to the north and south, this zone experiences distinct wet and dry seasons. It is common in regions such as the Sahel, a semi-arid area just south of the Sahara Desert.

Desert Climate: This is dominant in northern Africa, where the Sahara Desert experiences extreme heat and very little rainfall. Similarly, the Kalahari and Namib deserts in southern Africa have arid climates.

Mediterranean Climate: The northern and southern tips of Africa, particularly in countries like Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa, have Mediterranean climates. These regions experience hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.

Temperate Climate: Found in the highlands of East Africa, such as parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, these areas enjoy more moderate temperatures due to higher altitudes, despite being near the equator.

3. Rivers and Lakes
Africa is endowed with many significant rivers and lakes that play a crucial role in its ecosystems, agriculture, and economies.

Rivers: The Nile River, the longest river in the world, flows northward from central East Africa to the Mediterranean Sea, supporting millions of people and sustaining agriculture along its banks. The Congo River is the second-largest river in the world by discharge and serves as a vital waterway for central Africa. Other important rivers include the Niger River in West Africa and the Zambezi River in southern Africa, which is home to Victoria Falls, one of the largest and most famous waterfalls in the world.

Lakes: Africa is home to some of the world’s largest freshwater lakes. Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa, lies at the intersection of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. Lake Tanganyika, one of the deepest lakes in the world, stretches along the borders of Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and Zambia. Lake Chad, though shrinking due to climatic changes, remains an important water source for several countries in the Sahel region.

4. Natural Resources
Africa is rich in natural resources, including minerals, fossil fuels, and fertile land.

Minerals: Africa holds vast mineral wealth. Countries like South Africa, Botswana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are leading producers of diamonds and precious metals such as gold and platinum. The DRC also holds significant deposits of cobalt and copper, which are critical to global industries.

Fossil Fuels: Africa is a major producer of oil and natural gas. Nigeria, Angola, and Algeria are the continent's top oil producers, while Libya holds some of the largest oil reserves. Natural gas deposits are abundant in countries such as Algeria and Egypt.

Agriculture: Africa's diverse climates allow for the cultivation of various crops. The fertile lands of East and West Africa produce staples like maize, millet, and cassava, while cash crops like coffee, cocoa, and tea are major exports for countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana, and Kenya. However, many regions also face challenges related to soil degradation and inconsistent rainfall.

5. Human Geography and Environmental Challenges
Africa's geography has influenced human settlement patterns, trade, and culture throughout history. Coastal areas, river valleys, and regions with fertile land have long been hubs of civilization. However, environmental challenges such as desertification, deforestation, and climate change are affecting the continent's landscape. The Sahel region, in particular, faces desertification as the Sahara expands southward, threatening agricultural livelihoods.

Water scarcity is another critical issue, particularly in northern and southern Africa. Rapid population growth, urbanization, and poor water management exacerbate the problem, putting additional pressure on Africa's limited freshwater resources.

Conclusion
Africa's geography is incredibly diverse, with its vast deserts, rainforests, mountain ranges, and river systems shaping not only its physical landscape but also its cultures, economies, and ecosystems. While the continent is blessed with abundant natural resources, it also faces significant environmental challenges that require sustainable management. Understanding the geography of Africa is crucial for appreciating its complexity and the opportunities and challenges it presents.

I'm worried I might have Rhabdo.,"So I went from 0% working out to getting a personal trainer this week and we had a really intense leg day Wednesday. Come Friday night I noticed my urine was coffee colored and online showed I might have Rhabdo. The nurse I spoke to said it could just be dehydration so I started gulping down water (like over a gallon) - and my urine turned clear right away! But then as the night progressed my urine became light pink...

After that I asked for a doctor and he ordered me blood and urine tests, which just came back. I imagine my doctor will contact me if anything's wrong but I'm so panicky right now I thought I'd ask for some input here. Really hoping I don't have Rhabdo...

Diagnosed with PCOS. History of migraines without auras, nonalcoholic fatty liver, gallbladder removal at 19, heel spurs both feet, prior anemic episodes but managed, history of exercise induced asthma and recent bronchitis in July/August 2024. Been told I probably have IBS. 

Medications taking regularly are Ovima 28 for birth control and managing PCOS for last month, bupropion 150mg once daily in am, multivitamin complete for last 3 weeks, ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for migraines, salbutamol as needed for asthma. 

Birth control medication history of Alysena 28 for 2 months prior to Ovima, depoprovera for 1.5 years, Lolo 28 since 16 years old. 

On to my current question that may or may not require my history: I have frequent lower left pelvic pain seemingly unrelated to my menstruation. I have been managing my Fibre intake for my whole adult life and have a history of rectal bleeding, fissures, hemorrhoids. Whenever I am constipated I feel pain. The best way for me to not be constipated is to drink a single cup of coffee as it seems to activate my digestion and get me to go. However this usually means that instead of normal looking BMs they're loose or diarrhea. My doctor told me last time when I brought it up that I probably just have IBS but I keep thinking about the worst possible cases. As far as I know my family does not have a history with colon cancer but everyone in my family has issues with digestion. I also get frequent acid reflux and heartburn but that's usually when I haven't eaten on time or when I lay down too soon after eating. 

What I want to know is if it's better to keep managing my digestion with coffee or if I need to advocate for a more thorough exam. I have had full admonial ultrasounds done but I don't know if they have looked at my intestines/colon. 

Thank you.

1fwzryz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slime/comments/1fwzryz/slimes_with_a_cardamom_or_fresh_ginger_scent/,Slimes with a cardamom or fresh ginger scent?,"Does anyone know of any slimes with a cardamom or fresh (not candied!) ginger scent? I know OG had a ginger slime but it doesn't look like they'll restock it any time soon. (I would honestly snag the whole sushi collection in a heartbeat if they ever bring it back!) 

Don't worry about recommending something currently out of stock, though – even knowing which shops to watch for these kinds of smells would be appreciated! Also, just to clarify, I'm not asking about perfumed type slimes that might contain these *notes*. They can smell really good for sure, but I'm specifically looking for slimes that replicate these specific smells so they should be the predominant note. (Although something like a cardamom bun or cardamom coffee, for example, would still be great as long you definitely get the cardamom note).

Preferred textures: snow and sand fizzes, clouds (and cloud doughs and creams), natural crunchies (gravel, perlite, etc.), jellies and milky clears, waters, anything with three (or more) slimes of contrasting textures and appearances.

Butters, clays, glossies, and icees don't really appeal to me on their own, but are fine when paired with other textures. Plastic crunches are really dependent on the specific slime. The only slimes that I *really* don't like are floams and foamy mix-ins (jelly cubes, packing peanuts, etc.).

Thank you! ☺️

On our first date, we had coffee at my uni library, held hands, and I put my arm around her. She seemed a bit awkward with this but didn’t object (asked her about hand holding and she agreed), so I thought she was just nervous. She seemed cheerful afterward and gladly agreed to dinner for our second date.

On the second date, a few days ago, we had dinner and then walked back to my place to eat while watching a movie sitting on my bed. I decided to put my arm around her after we finished eating, but she pulled away and asked, “Can we please not do this?” I immediately pulled my arm back and apologized and was taken aback since she hadn’t objected on the first date. The rest of the movie felt awkward, even though she still talked to me later in the night as if nothing had happened.

I walked her home after the movie, and we side hugged before parting ways (which she's totally comfortable with). It's interesting because we cheek kissed on the first date (la bise), and we side hugged when we met for the second date, but there was no kiss.

I’m surprised by this regression in intimacy since this hasn’t happened to me before. It makes me wonder if she’s not interested in me anymore or if she just wants to take things slower. I usually like moving a bit fast, but I’m totally cool with a girl who prefers to take things slow, so this experience really threw me off.

Should I bring this up with her? I want to make sure I’m respecting her boundaries, but I’d also like to clarify how she feels and why. I really hate making anyone uncomfortable, and this whole situation has left me feeling pretty bad about myself. Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated.

I usually like moving a bit fast, but I’m totally cool with a girl who prefers to take things slow, so this experience really threw me off.

Should I bring this up with her? I want to make sure I’m respecting her boundaries, but I’d also like to clarify how she feels and why. I really hate making anyone uncomfortable, and this whole situation has left me feeling pretty bad about myself. Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated.

How do I clean stubborn coffee stains off my [Breville Barista]?,"A couple of weeks ago, I bought a Crema (brand) porta filter from Amazon because it looked beautiful and the marketing got me hooked. But every time I use it, no matter how tightly I lock it in, the coffee splatters all over my Breville Barista machine. I’ve been cleaning it as quickly as I can after use, but I missed a few days and now there are stains that won’t come out, even after trying a cleaning product made for aluminum and stainless steel.

Does anyone know how to remove these stains?

This is a last minute trip but I found a great deal, and I found myself between jobs with a chance to go while I am young. I did  5 days Toyko- 6 days Kyoto- Osaka for 12 days last April, while I enjoyed the trip very much, This time I wanted to not rush as much, and really savor Japan and do some things I did not get a chance to do.

Here is my rough itinerary

Tuesday October 22^(nd): Day Zero: None Stop EWR 14 hour flight to Land in Haneda 3pm, Train to Ueno Hotel (Literally called Ueno hotel, lmao its small but 10 minute walk from station) check in, take it easy and get dinner, stay awake till 10pm to avoid jet lag!

Wednesday October 23^(rd): Day 1:  Shrine Visits +Tokyo Tower? Senso Ji> Zenkoku -Ji Yasukuni? (Maybe) Meji Jingu for Fall Foliage, Nogi jinja shrine

Thursday October 24^(th) Day 2: Obida Day! Breakfast at Tsukiji market 8am- Team Lab Borderless 10am-1pm, Lunch, Gundam Statue and nearby attractions – Go out at Night (Shinbashi) and take some cypher punk esquisse sweet night photos?

Wednesday: Free day! I want to give myself one free day with zero itinerary. Get some coffee, pick a random direction and go.

Thursday October 31^(st)- Check out 11am- Leave Bags at hotel- Explore for about 3 hours, one final lunch, get o Haneda two hours before at 4pm before 6pm flight home to Newark

Things to fix from last time-  
No switching cities so less stress with luggage and switching hotels

Keep in touch with family friends to avoid homesickness

Bring american medicine/ benedryl for easier sleep

Comfy Brooks shoes so I can walk more  
Coin purse and across chest bag for less awkward coin/wallet handling

For those who have received or have given corporate gifts, I had a few questions.

1. If you want to send donuts/coffee or something like that to an office, is there a way to do that with a note attached so the people enjoying it know who it's from? (Uber gift deliveries lets you send a gift, but they only send a text that says it's a gift so only that one person knows who its from and you count on them to tell everyone else where they came from).
2. If you want to send lunch to their staff, is there a company out there where you can send them a link to pick what they want from some preselected options? Or maybe a restaurant that offers this? 
3. We also want to send some individual nice gifts periodically to people. I've seen there are platforms where you can do that and you don't have to have their address (they put it in when they claim), but most of the ones I've seen start with large commitments (like $20k a year). We're a small business not planning on committing to that level until we see how well it works for us. Any small business friendly options? (I did see Goody, but the test drive makes it feel like shopping with their swap options which wasn't ideal.)

The lights dimmed, casting an eerie shadow over the arena. The air thickened with an eerie stillness, as if time itself held its breath in the wake of the tragedy. A brief intermission was called after round 11 so that the cleanup crew could pick up whatever was left of Kon Mujin’s lifeless body. 



*Lobby Area* 



“...Yikes. I knew this tournament had ‘Life and Death’ in the name but I never expected someone to get their head splattered to bits.” Alicio Galang remarked, taking a seat on one of the many plush velvet couches that were placed in the lobby. 

“That scene was straight out of a horror movie.” Stephen Mersher replied, sitting beside Alicio. “I lost my appetite after seeing that crap!” 

“I enjoy beating the crap out of people but killing them is where I draw the line. I got my morals ya know?” Alicio said, stretching his arms. 

Halcon Rojo, who sat beside Alicio, nodded in agreement. “Even hardcore wrestlers have a moral code they follow, despite the barbaric environment. Vilmar Wu is nothing short of a monster.”

“You can say that again, him and that other Wu chick are freaks of nature.” Stephen replied. 

A smug grin tugged at the corners of Alicio’s mouth, his eyes gleaming with the unmistakable satisfaction of someone who knows they're winning. “And that makes beating the crap out of them all the more satisfying.” He boldly said as he clasped his hand into a fist. 

“You better win this Alicio.” Halcon says, playfully elbowing Alicio, “I can’t stand for you to lose to someone else before our rematch.” 

“Do you even gotta ask?” Alicio replied with a chuckle.  



*The Break Room*



“Good grief, I’m getting too old for this shit.” Tashiro Mosashi said, with a towel over his shoulders as he lay wearily on the couch. His hand trembled as he wiped the cold sweat from his brow, his fingers brushing over damp skin. Beads of perspiration clung to his forehead, dripping down his temples in nervous streaks. His breath came in shallow, uneven gasps, and despite the chill in the room, his body felt warm, flushed from the surge of fear coursing through him. He swiped at the moisture again, as if trying to erase the panic and fear he felt twenty minutes ago. 

“Sheesh man, you look terrible.” Riku said, walking in as he handed the referee his iced coffee 

Tashiro took the drink, his fingers curling around the slick aluminum. With a quick flick of his thumb, the tab popped open and lifted the can to his lips, taking a large swig. 

“Appreciate it kid,” Tashiro remarked, “Just being around those two...made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I could just feel my body telling me to run and get the hell out of there.” 



Riku nodded, taking a seat across from the referee. “I don’t blame ya, those two were probably the most unhinged fighters in this tournament.” He said, before remembering something. “Oh right! Almost forgot why I came here. Hatori told me to tell you that he’ll be covering the match for today.” 

The tightness in Tashiro’s brow eased, and his eyes, once clouded with concern, softened. A faint smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. 

“That’s so kind of him. Guess I owe him one now.” Tashiro chuckles as he checks his watch. “You better get a move on, the match is about to start.”

Back in the arena, everyone knew they were about to witness something extraordinary. The crowd went wild as a fan favorite was going to be fighting in this round. Even while Sayaka’s voice boomed through the loudspeakers, the crowd went wild. Those who knew who was fighting next stomped their feet rapidly in unison, which shook the whole arena. 



**""Ladies and gentlemen!"" Boomed Sayaka, her voice filled with excitement. ""Finally the wait is over! Let us commence with round 12! Introducing our first fighter!  Standing at 187 cm tall and 87 kg, this man is no stranger to the Kengan matches! His reputation precedes him, having been the champion of the previous Annihilation Tournament! His kicks are feared by all, rumor has it that they’re powerful enough to kill a God! Havibg been crowned as the new King of the Kengan Matches one year ago, It's** ***The Funeral Dove!*****... Jiiiiiiiiiin Kaaaaaaazuya!""**



A wave of hushed whispers swept through the crowd as Jin Kazuya walked out. His appearance was as haunting as his reputation—a pale specter with messy black hair falling just below his neck, black fingernails adding to his grim, spectral aura. His body was slim but muscular, honed for precision and power. As he walked toward the ring, his expression was unreadable, his gaze cold and distant, giving the sense that he was far removed from the world around him.



All the fighters who were watching the match all unanimously came to the same conclusion having laid their eyes on him. 

  


***This man was strong***



“Damn…this pressure is insane.” Raphael Xirya muttered to himself. 

“You said it! I’m getting goosebumps as we speak!” uttered a voice beside him.

Raphael turned his head to see a tall man with a well-balanced, muscular frame, each muscle defined yet not overly bulky. His wild, silver hair shot out in untamed spikes, catching the light and adding to his fierce appearance. Dressed for battle, he wore a pair of striking red shorts, the fabric adorned with golden flames that flickered in intricate patterns down the sides, giving him a fiery and intimidating look. 

“Not to be rude or anything but who are you?” Raphael asked, curiously.

“Oh right! Where are my manners!” The man exclaimed before extending his hand for a handshake. “Tetsuhaya Nakahashi, I’m the affiliate fighter for Canine Electronics Inc.” 

Raphael smiled back as he shook Tetsuhaya’s hand. “I’m Raphael. Raphael Xirya.”

“Stunning performance you had, Cha Tae-Jin’s considered a prodigy among prodigies in the Taekwondo sphere. Defeating him is a serious feat!” Testu said

“Thanks, I appreciate it dude.” Raphael replied. “Cha Tae-Jin was probably the strongest opponent I’ve faced so far”

“No shame in admitting that!” Tetsu replied earnestly, “I’d say he could even give the new king of the Kengan matches a run for his money, but that’s just an assumption.” 

“This king…what do you know about him?” Raphael asked

Tetsuhaya pondered for a bit, touching his chin. “Well, I never watched his performance in the previous annihilation tournament but I’ve heard rumors. He’s what many call an ‘***Apex Kicker***’.”

“Impressive…does that mean his striking is as good as Gaolang’s?” 

“I’m not sure about that, take what I say with a grain of salt. He’s crazy strong is all I really know. But if we were to give credit to the rumors, I suppose he could be what Gaolan is when it comes to pure kicking ability, guess we’ll find out soon enough.”” 



Jin Kazuya was a man who had risen to the pinnacle of the Kengan world. He was a ghostly figure who fought with an unorthodox style that had left a trail of unconscious bodies in his wake. No one knew exactly how he fought until they faced him—by then, it was already too late. 



**""And introducing his opponent, "" Sayaka continued, raising her voice over the cheers of the crowd. ""Standing at 195 centimeters and weighing in at 100 kilograms… In a duel behind closed doors on the S.S Kengan, this powerful lady defeated** ***The One Union,*** **Benjamin Togata and took his spot as a fighter!  reigning champion of the European Female MMA Open Weight League, she’s undefeated with her MMA record being a staggering 80 wins and 0 losses… it’s** ***The Nordic Juggernaut*****…Saraaaaaa Sund!**"" 



The crowd erupted into thunderous applause as Sara Sund appeared, her towering figure drawing all eyes. Tall, powerful, and imposing, she radiated strength and dominance. With her muscular frame and focused blue eyes, she had earned her place as one of the most dangerous women in Europe. 



“This tournament is just filled with surprises ain’t it.” Tetsuhaya chuckled 

“To think the strongest woman in the MMA world would take a shot at becoming a champion in the underworld...colored me surprised.” Raphael replied

“Can you blame her?” Tetsuhaya said, “The public fighting scene just ain’t it anymore. Once you reach a certain threshold in strength, it’s pretty much unproductive to keep fighting weak opponents, no disrespect of course.” 



“It seems the Kengan Association is allowing women to participate in their matches.” Jurota Arashiyama, sitting amongst the crowd, said. 

“Something wrong with that, Arashiyama?” asked Rolon, who sat beside Jurota. 

“Well, not that it concerns me in particular but there is still a disparity between the level of fighters in both the female and male leagues in other underground fighting associations. What exactly changed for them to allow women, knowing well that the men will most likely dominate them?” Arashiyama said, rather perplexed at the direction this tournament was heading. 

“There are still a good chunk of female fighters out there who can hold their own against their male counterparts. We saw that in round nine after all.” Rolon replied, “You can say that Wu Kazimah is an outlier but she alone proves that if there are women powerful enough to challenge the men.” 

“Hmm…I suppose you are correct, Rolon.” Arashiyama replied after pondering his response. 

“Not saying that I support mixed-gender fighting leagues.” Rolon continued, “A few outliers don’t change the general consensus but I wouldn’t be opposed to the idea of giving exceptions to a few talented women who can reach our level.” 



The arena buzzed with anticipation. The reigning Kengan champion versus the undefeated European MMA queen—this was the match that everyone had been waiting for. Sara, despite her own impeccable record, couldn’t ignore the presence of the man across from her. Jin had already conquered the most brutal tournament in the world, and she knew this fight was going to be the biggest challenge of her career. As Sara stepped into the arena, her eyes met Jin’s. There was a glint of confidence in her gaze, but Jin remained impassive, his cold eyes betraying nothing. For a moment, the tension between them was palpable, a silent promise of the war to come.



Cheetah Hatori stepped between them, glancing at both fighters. ""Fighters at the ready!"" he declared, raising his hands up. 

Jin adopted an unorthodox stance that seemed to be a mesh between traditional Karate and Taekwondo meanwhile Sara took a classic MMA stance. 



**“Begin!”** he exclaimed, shooting his hand down to initiate the start of the match. 



Jin was the first to move, his body light and fluid as he danced around Sara, his hands held low to his body in his usual unorthodox style. He was known for his legs, and he wasted no time in showcasing them. In an instant, his right leg shot up in a powerful roundhouse kick, the movement so fast it was barely visible to the naked eye.



“**And it’s Jin who makes the first move! Immediately going for a roundhouse kick!”** Riku says



Sara saw it coming and raised her guard, her powerful forearms absorbing the impact. The sound of bone meeting flesh echoed through the arena, but Sara remained unfazed. She was used to taking heavy hits, and this was no different. Jin eyebrows raised slightly. ***Tch, she’s no ordinary brute,*** He thought to himself as Sara grinned cockily at him. She responded with a lightning-fast jab, her fist aimed at Jin’s ribs. However, Jin was already gone, his body twisting away with eerie grace as he narrowly dodged the punch. He retaliated with a spinning back kick aimed at Sara’s shoulder, his foot slicing through the air with deadly precision. Sara grunted as the kick connected, the force behind it enough to make her stumble back a step but she managed to keep herself on the ground, despite her badly bruised shoulder. 



“**Woah! Ladies and gentlemen, Sara stands strong as she takes a devastating high kick from Jin!” Sayaka exclaims**



The crowd erupted in cheers as the two fighters exchanged blows, their contrasting styles clashing in a beautiful display of violence. Jin was light on his feet, his movements like a deadly dance as he used his legs to strike from all angles. Sara, on the other hand, was grounded and powerful, her fists were like hammers as she tried to close the distance between them. 



Sara was known for her ability to overwhelm her opponents with sheer force, and she was determined to do the same to Jin. She closed the gap between them, her fists flying in rapid succession as she aimed for his liver, his head, and his ribs. Her punches were like a storm—relentless and brutal. ***If I can land just one clean hit, I’ll be able to control the flow of the fight,*** she thought to herself as she bum rushed Jin. 



But Jin was no ordinary fighter. He had faced the strongest opponents in the previous Kengan Annihilation Tournament, and had emerged victorious. He moved with a calm precision, dodging Sara’s punches with minimal effort. His legs were his weapons, and he used them with devastating effect. Every time Sara tried to land a punch, Jin would respond with a powerful kick in response…despite her best efforts, Sara was struggling to keep up with Jin’s speed and precision as he relentlessly counterattacked in her blind spots. She was used to overpowering her opponents, but Jin was different. He didn’t rely on brute strength—he relied on raw skill, and their differences in technique were beginning to show. 



“She’s gonna need to change up her strategy, those strikes are as good as useless against a fighter like him.” said Alicio, who was watching from his seat. 

“How would you deal with his kicks?” Halcon Rojo asked curiously.

“An in-fight would be the best strategy to deal with his type. Getting right up and personal in his face would prevent him from using his kicks to their maximum potential.” Alicio replied, before his eyes narrowed into a serious gaze. “But that’s easier said than done. Sara probably had the same idea as me, but Jin’s a step ahead of her. There’s only one other way for her to cope with his strikes.”



However, as Jin attempted to land another kick, Sara managed to catch it right before it hit her shoulder. Her powerful arms were like large oak trees wrapping around his leg as she threw him to the ground. The impact was loud and powerful, creating a small crater beneath them. Jin grimaced in pain, slightly dazed as Sara quickly mounted him. 

“And that is of course, to take the fight to the ground.” Alicio finished his sentence. “Cuz now he’s in her world.” 



“**Looks like Jin is in trouble folks! Getting mounted by an MMA fighter spells curtains for most fighters!” Sayaka exclaimed**



Jin raised his hands up immediately, just before Sara could smash his face in with her hammer fists. She pounded his guard, Jin grunted in pain. Her punches were heavy and powerful, akin to a Pro-Wrestler’s. Jin knew he’d be in trouble if he couldn’t escape the mount, he could feel his forearms getting swollen. It wouldn’t be long before she fractured his bones. 



**“Sara’s pounding on him! Looks like she’s chosen to finish the fight with striking” Riku added** 



Using his left knee, Jin pushed Sara up as she was about to initiate her strikes, catching her off guard as her own momentum caused her to fall forward. Take advantage of the moment Jin threw a right hook. He wasn’t known for being a powerful striker but even Sara knew that a well placed strike could knock her out right then and there. Realizing her predicament, she quickly grabbed his hand before he could land the hook and put it into a joint lock.



However, this plan backfired on her as this gave Jin the opportunity to counter attack. With precision, he landed multiple rabbit punches to the back of her head. Sara, realizing that it was safer to disengage, hopped off Jin and distanced herself. Sara grunted in frustration, but she wasn’t about to give up. She had never lost a fight, and she wasn’t about to start now. With a roar of determination, she surged forward, her fists flying in a furious barrage of punches aimed at Jin’s body and head.



**“And she’s mounted off! Jin Kazuya isn’t a champion for nothing! He managed to escape an impossible situation, while staying calm and collected!”** 



As Sara threw another powerful right hook, Jin ducked under it and countered with a devastating spinning back kick to her ribs. The impact was enough to make Sara stagger, her body wracked with pain. Jin didn’t let up—he followed up with a series of quick kicks to her legs, his feet striking with precision and speed. Sara was in trouble now. Her movements were slowing, her body beginning to show the signs of wear and tear from Jin’s relentless assault. But she wasn’t done yet. With a fierce determination, she lunged forward, aiming a powerful punch at Jin’s head.



But Jin was ready. He sidestepped the punch and, with a fluid motion, launched a spinning heel kick aimed at Sara’s temple. The kick connected with a sickening crack, and Sara’s eyes rolled into the back of her head, her body dropping lifelessly to the ground. 



The crowd fell silent for a moment, stunned by the sudden end to the fight. Then, as Hatori rushed to check on Sara before raising his hand to signal the end of the match, the arena erupted in cheers.



**""Match over! Winner, Jin Kazuya!""**



The crowd’s cheers grew louder as Jin raised his hands in victory. He had done it again. The reigning Kengan Annihilation Tournament champion had defended his title, defeating yet another powerful opponent in his quest for dominance. Jin stood in the center of the ring, his expression as calm and detached as ever. He looked over at Sara’s unconscious body as the medic team arrived to put her on a stretcher before taking a look at his hands, which were swollen badly. 

“She was strong.” he simply said as he walked off. 



Meanwhile, on the arena balcony, Vilmar Wu stood, having watched the entire fight go down. His lips curled into a slow, deliberate grin, one corner tugging higher than the other, exposing just the edge of his teeth. The smile didn't reach his cold, calculating eyes, which gleamed with dark amusement. His gaze locked onto his target, and there was something predatory in the way his grin widened, as if he was savoring an unseen victory. The air around him seemed to thicken, as if the room itself recoiled from the twisted malice hidden behind that smile.

“What do you think of him, brother?” asked Einar Wu. “This man is the champion of the previous Kengan Annihilation Tournament.” 

Vilmar didn’t bother turning around as he continued to stare at Jin as he walked off. “What do I think of him? Don’t joke with me Einar, you know exactly what I’m thinking!” 

“Found another toy you like?” 

“Indeed…this man is even better than Ziare,” Vilmar said, not bothering to hide his malice. “I will thoroughly enjoy tearing him apart limb by limp and splashing his innards all over the arena floor for the crowd to see!”

Which hard region should I try next?,"Hello. I am on my first really good interloper run. Previously my loper record was like 14 days. Now I finally understood it. First I picked all the ""low hanging fruit"" in PV, ML, FM, BR, Milton, CH, DP and finders keepers pass (without entering Blackrock itself).

Then I pushed myself and did some harder regions where I didn't know the map: Timberwolf mountain - first time ever summiting on interloper, then Ash Canyon. It was really hard. I survived by being well prepared and bringing in lot of supplies.

Which tough region should I tackle next? Should I try hush-hush river valley? Or brave timberwolves in BI or BRP? Or should I explore DLC areas (Far out territory) for more lucrative loot?

I don't know the maps, but I understand game mechaincs pretty well. And I have good gear. Double bear coats, all kinds of crafted clothing, combat pants, technical backpack, moose hide satchel, distress pistol and flare shells, stims, magnifying lenses, fire striker, lots of coffee tins etc. I have maxed out skills in everything except ice fishing and mending (level 4 now) and gun stuff.

I don't do very well in maps without man made shelter like TWM. I was pretty good in handling predators so far but tinderwolves are another league.

So experienced Interloper players. What region would you recommend to hit next? I understand it's going to be risky and I could lose my run. I am ok with that. I would just like to score some good loot if I survive there.",5,1728159846.0,thelongdark,3,1.0,False

Friday night we are driving to holland in the evening to stay with a family member. We are considering trying sleeping bear dunes on the way down there since it’s in route from Mackinac to holland. We’ve also considered doing a second day exploring Mackinac island on Friday instead. Is it worth it to do two days in Mackinac or should we make the trip to sleeping bear dunes?

We’re tight on time, and trying to find a balance between seeing everything we really want to see and making sure we’re not constantly driving and rushing around. If we were to add a day, should we spend more time at pictured rocks, spend more time on Mackinac island, or try tahquamenon falls?

I think I have found about 30 of them (and getting more). I have made these new images into postcards of their own and people have been giving me great feedback. Several people have suggested making a coffee table book of sorts. I thought it would be cool to have these images with quotes from locals about their own, personal history of that location. I guess I just like seeing and hearing how things have changed. But I don't know the first thing about publishing. Do I need a manuscript? How would I design a manuscript? Should I seek out a publisher or just self publish? Is this too many questions for one post?

I am currently looking for someone to take over my lease here at Cullen Oaks as I need to move closer to my new job. I am looking to move out asap, but am open to waiting till the spring semester.

I live in a 2Bed 2Bath Grad fully furnished unit at Cullen Oaks, which is on campus. Even though this is student housing, you do NOT have to buy a meal plan. Rent is $1349 and includes utilities. Rent is negotiable!!

The Grad refers to the fact that it is fully furnished and comes with a washer and dryer inside the apartment as opposed to having to share one with others. Additionally, there are only 6 Grad Units in the entire apartment complex.

The apartment comes with a couch, dining room table, 3 coffee-like tables in the living room, and in the room, it comes with a dresser, study desk, and a twin xl bed and mattress. 

I live in room B. Unlike my A, room B has the bathroom connected to the room and is much bigger! 

I live with one girl and she’s super sweet and chill! She is usually out majority of the day at work or school, so the place is pretty quiet; if you like having your own space, this is perfect! 

Cullen Oaks has its own 24/7 gym and study center with access to computers and a printer.

As far as parking goes, a parking pass at Cullen allowed you to park at multiple zones at UH. 
1. Cullen Oaks Parking 
2. Zone A
3. Zone D 
4. Zone E
5. Zone F

1fwzcxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1fwzcxn/what_to_do_with_tv_room_with_too_many_speakers/,"What to do with ""TV Room"" with too many speakers?","We have a room which is 90% for TV watching (there's a separate living/dining area for entertaining, meals, etc). Since it's almost entirely focused on TV watching, it's set up more like a home theater, with a 7.1.2 speaker system (the 2 large brown boxes in pictures are floorstanding speakers, the 4 ""stools"" are surround speakers on stands and the black box is a subwoofer). 

The room is awkwardly shaped, and the nook with the windows is currently a place where our dog hangs out and looks out the window. It faces south, and I'd like to be able to use this space as a reading nook on weekend mornings to sip coffee and do the crossword.

Right now, the room is just really blah. It has a bunch of furniture which we collected over the years and none of it goes together. The walls are all painted HGTV Greige™️, with brown-grey flooring which looks like the picture (it's a new build house, so *of course* it has this wretched aesthetic)

Ideally, I'd like the room to look more cohesive and ""designed"", but right now it's a mess, albeit a fairly functional one. I feel like if I put a lounge chair in the nook it would feel weirdly disjoint from where the couch is, but if I flipped the TV position and pointed the couch the other way, the speakers would very much obstruct the pathways around the room. My ""audiophile"" husband is very insistent that speakers can't go too close to the walls, so they're just awkwardly imposing on everything.

So I think I'm stuck with the layout, and maybe I can do something to more clearly divide the room between the TV area and the nook, but I'm not really sure how.

I'm currently thinking I'll keep the layout largely unchanged, but just try to make it look nicer. New furniture, maybe wall panelling (though I feel like this is a trend which is already feeling dated/over-done?). I'd like to put shelving on the wall where the TV is to break it up a bit, but (again!) the speakers are in the way.

With all these speakers, I feel like I don't really have any options, and I'm not sure I want to get into the conversation about replacing them (basically all my husband does it look for excuses to buy more speakers). There also needs to be storage space for an AV receiver, games consoles, a center speaker, etc.

Any suggestions? I'm open to layout changes, new furniture, painting, everything! Just some inspo for an aesthetic would be super helpful. If I search for ""home theatre"" inspo it's all like an actual cinema, but it's not quite a den or a living room either 🤷

I now have a north map that connects to the original south map. It was originally for government use when there was an alien crash sited on a farm, so the government decided to build a base and interstellar communication base. After that was defunct and no longer needed, they decided to go with the tourism plan and repurposed the old base with an F1 and sports/ entertainment complex. North Perkins is still very under-developed, but there’s tons of potential for land use.

1fwz7z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1fwz7z1/epic_fueling_failure_on_30k_practice_race_today/,Epic fueling failure on 30k practice race today (cw - bodily …misfunctions),"Hey folks.   First of all TW for mention of expelling contents of one’s guts both ways.



…alright then.   I’m 34F training for first road marathon in 35 days. Aiming for 4:15.  Started running 14 months ago but have lots of other fitness. 

  Today I did a 30km, 1000+meter trail race and treated it like a dress rehearsal (despite obv differences in course type).   I finished in 3:50 so time on feet quite similar.   The race went great, I felt strong, ran all the runnables, my grade adjusted pace splits were super consistent, no pains or niggles, and I ended with my tank totally empty but still in good spirits and perfectly comfortable walking around and doing some light socializing.      I was also proud of my fuel plan because in the past I’ve hated all gel flavors and only last week found a delicious once.   So it total over the 30km and nearly four hours, I consumed the following even spread from KMs 5-25:

-4 decathlon raspberry flavor gels - 23g carbs each. Not caffeinated and no salt. 
-4 decathlon brand caffeinated gummy chews, 10 g each
-500ml isotonic electrolyte + glucose drink, 35g carbs
-4 orange slices from aid stations, idk 3 carbs each?
-2.5 liters water bc I’m always a very thirsty runner

So we’ve got 3L of fluid and 179g of carbs working out to about 45g of carb per hour.   I def feel like I needed all that energetically, my legs were starting to get heaving AF when it was time for my next gel/chew.   My stomach felt amazing during the race, no issue at all.  I was shooting for 60g of carb per hour bc I see 60-90 reccommend often and I’m quite small so I thought OK to be on the low end.  But no way did I want to eat any more than what I did on course. 

30-45 mins post finish I was not hungry at all but drank 500ml water and tried to eat the offered lunch: a bowl of meat stew traditional to my country and a sandwich that was a thing pork chop on a fluffy roll.   I had half the soup and thought, this is so delicious but so high in fat that my stomach was like “nope.”  I only had a few bites of the sandwich but the whole thing was so dry with my dry post race mouth so I chucked it.  I also drank a can of Coke Zero because I normally have my second cup of coffee at that time, and there was no coffee or regular coke available.

I ended up spending two hours waiting around bc it was a small race with few women so my modest performance earned me two podium spots (love a small town race haha) and there was a little classification drama that delayed us all.  Ate a few salty chips in that time period.  Still feeling great.   Then had a one hour drive. Halfway through (2.5 hours post finish) I felt ravenous but had to just keep driving. By the time I got home I was SUPREMELY nauseous.

About 3.5 hours post race I started puking…first the lunch, and then all the gels and race fuel. Ladies and gentlemen, it was very hard to puke the gels.   getting out the puke helped with the nausea but I was so thirsty and couldn’t keep down any sips of water.   then the gut cramps started and i proceeded to empty my guts out the other end and it was….lets say a torrential volume.      This went on for like 2 hours followed by 4 hours of lying in bed totally out of it , and now here i am just recently able to keep down small sips of water.  Diarrhea still intermittent.  


So….help!   Was this the gels? i took them with so much water!!   But I have never taken 3 gels in one run before.  In my 30km long run I had one gel, some chews, glucose drink, and stopped halfway for an ice cream cone (before today I always described myself as having a stomach of steel).

I felt so good until a few hours after the race.   Was it the high fat post race lunch? Was it the simply ignoring my hunger cues while driving home?
