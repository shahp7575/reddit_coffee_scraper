Today i was out with friends and i only had 16 $ , they both wanted to go to a fancy restaurant and i agreed. I got a 4 $ coffee . I wanted to get a side but they were out of the mashed potatoes i liked so i opted out. Then they got drinks and main corses and my friend gave me the fish that came with her salad . She said she didint want it but who knows 🤷‍♀️ They also ordered desserts and i felt alot of fomo, not cuz i wanted a sweet but bec i was the only one not eating sweets or ordering anything besides coffee.

Lol it was kinda embarrassing to be the only one not getting anything especially when u have such kind friends cuz they kept offering me things and i dont want to ruin a vibe by not ordering food while they eat. But oh well 🤷‍♀️im broke till my next paycheck and i would have overdrawn my debit account so i made a difficult choice for myself. 😮‍💨 i also had to put away a super cute sweater when we went shopping after, first time in a very long time i left a clothing store with nothing. 

It was difficult but im proud of myself. ",5,1732675842.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False

Lots of people collect things.  My Aunt Vivian used to joke that she collected people.  She’d always done it since I could remember—rolling along next to me as we went on one of our outings, she would always have a Polaroid camera dangling from a strap around her neck like a 90s kid’s idea of an old-fashioned reporter.  Not that I thought about it back then—she’d always had it, and she didn’t use it all the time, just when she ran across certain people.  I asked her once what made her decide who to take pictures of, and at first she just gave me her beautiful, mysterious smile.  She was twenty years older than me, but she looked much younger when she smiled like that.

Laughing, she held up the camera like she was going to take my picture.  “I just look for those people that are extra shiny to me.”  She lowered it again without snapping as her smile faded a little.

“Why don’t you take a picture of me then?  Aren’t I shiny?”  I had injected a bit of fake hurt into my voice—at least I thought it was fake.

Gripping the wheels of her chair, she turned and started heading across the food court where we’d just eaten lunch.  “You’re plenty shiny, sure.  But I already have you, don’t I?”

Running to catch up with her, I put my hands gently on the chair’s handles without really adding any push.  “Sure,  Viv.  Sure.”

She glanced back at me with a grin.  “That’s what I thought.”

**** 

She had hundreds of photos, all organized in albums by some organizational scheme that I didn’t understand.  Maybe it was alphabetical—after all, she never took someone’s photo without asking permission and getting their name.  The few times when I was really young that I’d suggested someone or something for her to take a picture of, she’d almost always politely refused.  No pictures of squirrels or dogs or trees, and no pictures of people unless they met Vivian’s “shiny” criteria and they agreed to be taken.

Stacks and stacks of albums of strangers, some shy or awkward or even annoyed, though many were smiling, happy to oblige the pretty woman in the wheelchair that thought they were worthy of her time and film.  When I was in high school they filled a bookshelf, and by the time I graduated college she’d devoted a walk-in closet to four larger shelves, all low enough that she could reach every book easily.

That ease of use was a necessity, though I didn’t figure that out until I was a bit older.  I lived a few hours away by that point, and while I still saw Aunt Viv at most big holidays and birthdays, I couldn’t deny that she felt more remote now.  Growing up we’d spent whole weeks together, just the two of us, and I missed that closeness, that friendship.  Maybe that’s why I went to see her on the spur of the moment, thinking it would be nice to get away from my graduate work and a good surprise to visit her without a particular reason.

I had to ring her doorbell several times before I got an answer, and when I did, I let out a small, involuntary gasp before putting my bag down and crouching next to Vivian.  

“What…are you sick?”

She gave me a wan smile that seemed to painfully stretch her dry, cracked lips.  Those lips were too pale, but everything about her seemed pale and fragile in that moment.  Everything but her eyes, that still danced with the same bright life and intelligence behind heavy, bruised-looking eyelids.

“A little, maybe.  Overtired, mainly.  Been working on a project I do every few months and it’s just…well, it’s taken more out of me this time than usual.”

Standing up, I grabbed my bag and walked in at her waving invitation.  “Do you need to go to a doctor or something?”

She laughed, but it was strained and thin.  “No, nothing like that.  I’ll be right as rain soon enough.”

I’d never known Viv to lie to me, but I didn’t believe her then.  Something was really wrong, and she was too stubborn or private to tell me about it.  That was her right, of course, but that fact didn’t help me worry less.  Giving her a smile I didn’t feel, I nodded.

“Okay, if you say so.  But at least let me help with whatever you’re doing, okay?  Just tell me what to do and I can do it while you rest.”

It felt like she considered my offer for a very long time.  It was probably less than ten seconds, but things seemed to stretch out forever as I waited awkwardly for her to reject my help.

“Okay.  I can trust you with it.  Follow me.”  Her expression didn’t change during this—just closed and neutral as she wheeled off toward the back of the house with me close behind.  I wasn’t surprised when she led me to her picture closet, but then I saw the interior of the room.

There were twice as many shelves now, and while some were empty, the filled space had clearly been growing at an increasing rate.  On the far end of the middle shelves I noticed a small stack of albums that were on a short table there.  What was she doing with them?

As if reading my thoughts, she answered right away.  “Pruning.  I only keep photos of people while they’re alive.  It’s a custom I have.  When I first started, I’d have to rely on newspapers and various paid services to find out when someone in my books passed.  But since the internet got big, it’s much easier.”  Vivian chuckled.  “Still time consuming, of course.  It takes way more time as I collect more people, and the longer I do it, the more likely that people will die.”  She shrugged.  “Still, it must be done.”

I stared at her.  Why?  Why did it need to be done?  It sounded boring and tedious, and what difference did it make?  I wanted to ask her, but I held my tongue.  For all her energy and interests, I knew that Vivian often had a hard and lonely life.  So what if she wanted to have odd hobbies and attach weird rituals to them?  Who did it hurt, and if it helped her, wasn’t it worth it?

“So what can I do?  Take out pictures of dead people?”

She grinned at me.  “No, I can do that part.  You can do the research.”

**** 

I spent the next two days “pruning” with Viv—I think we removed over three hundred people from over 4,000 in the books, though at some point I lost count.  When I left the next day, I wouldn’t say that Vivian looked like her old self, but she did seem more rested and relaxed.  She also made me promise to visit more often, and when I said I would, I meant it.

Over the next two years I did visit more, and other than a joking comment here or there, I never really brought up how quickly her collection was growing.  You might think she’d start running out of people in the area she lived, but she almost never took pictures there.  Instead, she traveled all over—West Coast, East Coast, big cities and little towns no one has ever heard of.  Looking up their obituaries and death certificates, I could have quickly accrued my own collection covering every state in the country.  I asked her once why she never travelled abroad for any pictures, and she just smirked at me.

“Harder to get death information ouf-of-the-country.”

I’d paused at that, weighing whether it was a joke or serious.  When her smirk broke into a grin, I returned it, going back to looking up if Ruby Holsek was still in the land of the living.  There was the name, and checking it against the picture…yeah it looked like she died six months earlier in a car accident.

**** 

During these years I didn’t really see my other family that often.  Christmas maybe, or when someone was very sick.  My time was taken up by school primarily, and when I had free time for family, I usually spent it with Viv.  Seeing her more often made it harder for me to notice her decline—harder, but not impossible.  I wanted to ask her what was going on and if she was going to be okay, because for all the time I’d spent with her,  I’d never fully understood what put her in that chair or kept her there.

In the end I couldn’t bring myself to ask her directly, worried that she’d get mad or depressed, or suddenly think I saw her as less of a person than a problem or the disease that put her in that position.  So instead I went home and asked my mother.

For her part, she looked startled.  She even paled a bit.  “Why are you asking about this?”

I shrugged.  “I’ve just been hanging out with Aunt Viv some.  And I worry about her.  She’s getting worse.  Weaker.”

Lighting a cigarette, my mother nodded.  “You always were close with her.  Closer than I ever was.  She was younger than me and your Uncle Andy.   Not by a lot, but enough.  Enough that she was the baby and we didn’t really want her around.”  She fluttered her hand dismissively.  “Not that we didn’t love her—we did.  But to a couple of older kids she was just a pain, and when she got older she started getting sick.  Everyone though she was going to die.”

My eyes widened.  “Is that when she went into the wheelchair?”

She shook her head.  “Not yet.  That didn’t happen until she was a teenager.  This thing she has…I don’t remember what they call it.  But it burns you out fast.  It starts with headaches and falling down more.  Then one day maybe your feet are numb or your legs don’t work good any more.  Before long you’re in a chair, then a bed, then you’re gone.”  She glanced up at me with a guarded look.  “At least that’s what they told us.

“It’s strange, hearing that your sister has a short shelf-life, like she’s a jug of milk or something.  Me and Andy figured she’d be gone within a year of two, and we felt guilty for not hurting more at the idea of losing her.  Again, it wasn’t that we didn’t love her.  It was more like we couldn’t really see the real her past all the responsibility and expense and hassle.  All the attention she got and how everything revolved around her.  And so, knowing that she was going to die soon, we really did feel sad about it.  Terribly sad.  But there was some relief there too.”

“Jesus.”  I just stared at her, not sure what to say.

My mother shrugged as she took another drag on the cigarette.  “I know how it sounds.  I do.  But we were kids.  And besides, she wound up living after all.”

Trying to keep my voice even, I asked a question that had been fluttering around in my head the past few minutes.  “How?  How did she live if she was supposed to die so quick?  Was she misdiagnosed?”

My mother shook her head.  “No one ever said it was a wrong diagnosis.  It was just chalked up to ‘a miracle’.  You’re too young to remember this, but your grandmother used to call her ‘miracle baby’ sometimes even after she was grown.  And she did it all the time when we were young.  It was annoying, but I got it.  It really did seem like something magical had happened—she went from looking worse on a weekly basis to being stronger and healthier again.  For awhile you couldn’t even tell anything was wrong with her.  Then she started slipping and falling again.  Not long after she had to go into a chair.

“Again we thought she was going to die soon, but no.  After a few weeks she was looking better.  Stronger and healthier.  She never got her legs back, but you couldn’t even tell it bothered her most of the time.  She’d just roll around, snapping pictures with those cameras of hers, happy and popular and full of life.”  She paused and shot me a look.  “She still doing that thing with taking pictures?”

I nodded silently.

My mother snorted.  “Figures.  She was always a weird girl.  I love her, but weird as hell.”

**** 

After that, I noticed the ebbs and flows in Vivian more—she would slowly decline, and then she’d spring back, though I realized now that her high point was always slightly lower than the time before.  And the catalyst for the improvement it was always the same—pruning out the dead people from her collection.

I think I’d noticed that from the start, but I always told myself that it was a coincidence or my imagination, or that the ritual itself or the company I provided were just giving her a temporary boost.   But as I watched her dip lower and lower only to come back again every time…well, eventually I knew something more was going on.  

That being said, I didn’t understand it, and I didn’t really want to question it if it helped her.  It wasn’t my curiosity or the growing sense of unease that I was a part of something strange and unnatural.  It wasn’t even the tickle in the back of my head warning that this wasn’t just magical, it was somehow wrong.  No, what caused me to finally talk to Aunt Vivian about it was the truth I was confronting more and more every time she opened the door.

“You’re dying.”

Aunt Vivian stopped sipping her coffee as she studied me over the rim of the cup.  We’d finished this round of pruning that morning, but she still looked thin and worn out.  “Aren’t we all?”

I frowned at her.  “That’s not what I mean.  I’m not stupid.  I know these pictures are helping you somehow.  Helping you fight…whatever it is that’s trying to take you.”  She didn’t say anything, so I went on.  “But I also know that you’re losing.  Even with taking more pictures and pruning more often, it isn’t bringing you back like it was.”

Sitting her cup down, she gave me a slight nod.  “Alright.  So what’s your point?  Because if this is your attempt at a pep talk, you really suck at it.”

I couldn’t help but smile a little, even though I felt like I could barely breathe.  “It’s not.  I just…I don’t understand how this works.  And I don’t really care, so long as it helps you.  But is there anything else we can do?  To make it work better or to heal you or something?”

I saw something shining in her eyes, maybe a brief sheen of tears, and then she was smiling at me.  She looked so beautiful in that moment that I laughed.  It didn’t seem fair that she could be so wonderful and have to face so much pain and worry.  I just…

“When I was young, I almost died.  Your mother may have told you this, and I won’t bore you with all the details, but I got a very bad, very aggressive disease that kills most people pretty quick.  And I could feel it working on me, like vines tightening around another plant until its dead.  I was scared, of course, and I’d try to do anything to distract myself.  I couldn’t play much with how I was feeling, but I still made myself walk around some every day, as though with enough exercise I could keep my limbs from betraying me.  

“I’d gotten an instant camera for my birthday that year, and I got the idea of taking pictures as I went around the neighborhood.  I took a couple of pictures of animals, but something told me to take pictures of people instead.  So that’s exactly what I did.

“The next day I felt better.  So I went out walking again, this time further.  In part because I had more energy.  In part because I somehow knew I needed to collect different people.

“The day after that, I felt even better, and that afternoon, I asked your grandfather to get me more film on his way home from work.”

“This went on for another week, and by the end of it, I felt like I’d never been sick.  If anything I felt better than I ever had, though I tried to hide it a little.  I wasn’t trying to lie, not really.  It was more just instinct that I didn’t want to stand out more than was necessary.  After that I took less pictures, but I still took them—I’d go a few days and then I’d get the urge.  The one time I ignored it, I started feeling sick again, and I didn’t need that lesson twice.  I was like you—I didn’t know what was happening, but I didn’t care so long as I stayed healthy.

“And I did…for a long time I did.  But this thing…I think of it like a tiger sometimes.  It’s always there, tracking me, trailing me.  Waiting to jump on me and bring me down.  I was fourteen when my legs started going again.  I took more pictures, and I could feel it helping a little, but it wasn’t nearly enough.  The tiger had me now, and it was going to drag me down to some place I couldn’t come out of.

“And then one day…one day our grandpa came to visit.  He was a preacher in another state, and it was rare that we ever saw him, but I guess my mother had told him that I likely didn’t have a lot of time left.  He came and sat with me for a couple of hours.  Talking to me, praying, telling me that God loved me.  He was a nice enough man, but he smelled like cloves and I didn’t really know him.  I just wanted him to go so I could sleep.

“He was about to go when he noticed the camera on my bedside table.  Asked me if I liked taking pictures.  If I would take a picture of him.  I wanted to say no, but something inside stopped me.  Instead, I picked up the camera, framed him, and hit the button.

“Then I hit it again.

“I knew right away it was different.  My skin was tingling as I waved to him and pretended to drift asleep.  I waited until I heard everyone going outside to see him off to see if I was well again.

“I fell to the floor.

“I had healed myself, partially.  I wasn’t dying anymore, not for the moment.  But my legs were still numb.  I tried over the next several weeks to get them back too—I took more pictures, but I always held off from taking more than one.”

“Why?”  I couldn’t help but interrupt.  “Why wouldn’t you take double pictures or a dozen pictures if that helped more?  You might be able to walk.”

She nodded with a rueful smile.  “Yeah, probably so.  But the reason I didn’t was because after my grandfather left our house that day, he died.  Just…stopped.  It was only an hour down the road from where I’d taken his pictures, and his car hadn’t even really wrecked.  It just rolled into a ditch after he stopped living.  They tried to claim it was a heart attack at the time, but I got the death certificate later.  Indeterminate cause of death.  I guess the medical examiner didn’t know to look for curses.”

I frowned at her.  “You don’t know you cursed him.”

Shrugging, she took another sip of coffee.  “I know that he died because of me, and that I benefited from it.  I know I’m doing a lesser version of the same to everyone I take pictures of, draining a bit of their life so I can live.”

I felt my stomach clench painfully.  “How do you know that?”

She raised an eyebrow.  “You know.  Why do you think I removed and destroy the photos of people who have died?  They don’t help me once they’re dead.  In fact, the opposite.  I sometimes wonder if the reason it hit me again so hard when I was fourteen was because I hadn’t known to prune.  That idea didn’t occur to me until a month or two after my grandfather died.  It felt like I was fighting death, after all.  Or bargaining with it.  And anyone who was already dead was just more weight against me.  So I started weeding out the people that were dead—it was just a few back then.  Right away I felt stronger.”

Giving a short, bitter laugh, she went on.  “And it’s not that I didn’t think about taking more double pictures back then.  But I was a child, and I felt good except for my legs.  So I told myself it was good enough.  And for a time, it was.”

I swallowed.  “So you never tried taking two again?”

Vivian smiled at me.  “I did, once.  I was in my late twenties.  My health was okay, but I was very depressed and lonely.  I wanted a full life, and I convinced myself I was rejecting a gift that I’d been given.  So I started watching the newspapers.  Found a man who had been let out on bail after killing his wife and child.  It didn’t take long before I had my pictures and he was dead.”

“Did it work?”

She waggled her hand back and forth.  “Yes and no.  I definitely felt stronger and more alive, but I still couldn’t walk.  That’s what made me realize, it wasn’t just the second picture and the dying that made it more powerful.  It was the connection.  I had gotten more from him dying, but far less than when my blood relative had died and brought me back from the edge.  But even my grandfather…he was kin, but I barely knew him.”  Her smile widened.  “Imagine if it was someone that I was kin to and I loved?”

I felt my skin grow cold.  “I…you want to use me?”

Aunt Vivian’s smile faded away.  “What would you say if I did?”

Swallowing, I nodded.  “I mean…yeah.  I don’t want to die, but if it helps you that much, maybe it’d be okay.”

She looked almost angry as her lips drew into a thin line.  “Get up then.  Go to your room and lie down on the bed.”

Nodding again, I stood up shakily and did as she told me.  When I was on the bed, I looked up to see her in the doorway to the room, camera in her lap.  Lifting it, she snapped my photo once.

“You shouldn’t be so quick to give your life away.  Take it from someone that’s fought for it every day for a very long time.”  Her face softened.  “I do love you for it, though.   Enough to not take a second picture.”

“I…are you sure?”

She raised a hand.  “Yes.  But I do need you to do something for me.  Toss me your phone.  I’m going to lock you in here.  There’s a bag in the bottom of the closet with bottles of water and health bars, and you have a bathroom.  In four days someone will come and let you out, but I need you to stay in here until that happens, okay?”

Throwing her my phone, she caught it deftly as I stared at her.  “A bag?  Have you been planning on locking me in here?”

Viv laughed softly.  “I have several plans all the time, even if I don’t know exactly when or if I’ll need them.  This was one of them, though I’d have called it a longshot.  Still, I’m very happy it worked out this way.”  She raised an eyebrow.  “Will you trust me and do as I ask?”

I nodded.  “Um, you’re not going off to kill yourself or something, right?”

Chuckling, she shook her head.  “You haven’t been paying attention.  I love living too much for that.  But you’re right.  Things can’t keep going like they are and I’ve been patient long enough.  It’s time to harvest what’s been planted.”

With that, she shut the door and locked me in.

**** 

I thought about breaking out over the next few days, but I wanted to keep my promise, so I didn’t.  And true to her word, on the fourth day, a guy I’d never seen before opened the door and told me my phone was on the kitchen table before walking back out.

When I got my phone, I had several missed messages.  A couple from friends, one from a girl I had been talking to lately, and several from my mother.  It was the last few of those that really caught my attention.

Are you going to be around this weekend?

You aren’t answering your phone.  Vivian is throwing this party (well, it’s at our house, so maybe I’m throwing it) but she wants all the family there.  Your sister is coming, and so is Uncle Andy and his family.  Viv will be heartbroken if you aren’t there.

Viv is about to start family pictures.  Where are you?

I stared at my phone.  The last text was from the night before.

“Oh fuck.”

**** 

The official report, which came weeks later, said that everyone must have died from some kind of gas leak, though there was no sign of anything like that the next morning when police arrived to do a wellness check at Uncle Andy’s wife’s request.  Seems she got a stomach bug at the last second and hadn’t made the trip after all, though their two little girls had.  Not that Vivian would mind that much.  Aunt Alison wasn’t blood after all, and they’d never been very close.

As for Viv, there was no sign.  Her bank accounts were empty, her photo albums were gone, and there was no trace of her at the party where most of her family had died.

Well, that’s not entirely true.

Because amid the dead bodies and decaying party food that filled the living room and kitchen of my parents’ house, one thing stood out.

- Add an item that changes a pokémons Main Skill. (*Lucario is my fav pokémon but his main skill with Dream shards is probably my least fav skill as I'm never short on dream shards. Don't you just wanna use your fav pokémon without worrying about underperforming?*)

    
- Adjust XP you get after sleep sessions. Make it a tad bit faster. It's way too slow. *I get that it's a sleep tracker and progress tends to be slow but it shouldn't be this hard to get a pokémon from level 6 to level 7*    



- Add more pokémon and more coverage to the ingredients and berries. What I mean by this is... there's so many pokémon having Ginger in their first slot or tomatoes but then there's not much pokémon covering stuff like Leek, Corn or Rousing Coffee in Slot 1. (*For example there is not a single pokémon covering Leek in slot 1. I'm trying to get my Quaxly to level 30 just so I can unlock Leeks. Same for some berries. Yache berries can only be obtained from the Dragonite evolution line and Altaria. More variety and coverage would be nice*)

- Game is suffering from content drought imo. Yeah, ik we just got Mimikyu with an awesome main skill Berry Burst. My strongest pokémon so far but looking at my previous point they should really start adding more pokémon frequently to fix the previous issue.

- Give us a reason to go for evolved pokémon. Make them a bit more special. Yes they're already higher level than baby or basic pokémon but it's not as rewarding. (*To fix this problem... Maybe they could give us level 2 or level 3 main skill automatically depending on it's a first or second evolution. That way they're the same as if you evolved them.*)

- Add an in-game message function or pin a message to let the people in your friend list know what candy you need the most atm.

- Trading. I know this is a Sleep Tracker but it's still a pokémon game. You want to collect as much different pokémon as possible. And if you're unlucky like me who can't get a specific pokémon to spawn no matter how hard you try it would be welcoming addition. (*Been playing the game for 4 months now and still no Riolu.

How to Style Your Space with Couch and Loveseat Reclining Combinations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Styling your space with couch and loveseat reclining combinations can create an inviting and comfortable atmosphere in your living room. These pieces aren’t just about function; they also add a touch of style to your home. Whether you’re starting from scratch or refreshing your current setup, here are some effective tips to make the most out of your reclining furniture.

### Create a Focal Point

Your couch and loveseat should be the stars of your living room. Position them to face each other or orient them towards a fireplace or television. This arrangement promotes conversation and creates a cozy gathering place. Be mindful of the distance; around 8 to 10 feet is ideal for conversation, while still allowing for the reclining feature to function smoothly.

### Choose the Right Color and Fabric

The color and fabric of your couch and loveseat can significantly impact the room's overall vibe. Consider the existing color palette of your space. If your room has neutral walls, a bold-colored reclining set can serve as a stunning contrast. Here are some fabric types to consider:

- **Leather:** Offers a sophisticated look and is easy to clean.
- **Microfiber:** Soft, durable, and available in a wide range of colors.
- **Linen:** Breathable and comes in various textures, giving a relaxed feel.

### Accessorize Smartly

Accessorizing your couch and loveseat reclining combinations can enhance their look. Here are some accessories to consider:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/couch-and-loveseat-reclining  
  
- **Cushions:** Add life and comfort with textured or patterned cushions.
- **Throws:** A cozy throw blanket can make the space feel warm and inviting.
- **Accent Tables:** A stylish side table can provide convenience while enhancing the overall aesthetic.

### Incorporate Surrounding Decor

Matching your recliners with surrounding decor helps create a cohesive look. Consider the following elements:

- **Wall Art:** Hang artwork that complements the furniture colors.
- **Rug:** A stylish area rug can tie the whole room together; ensure it’s large enough to fit under at least the front legs of your reclining furniture.
- **Lighting:** Use table lamps or floor lamps to create a warm ambiance while also providing practical light for reading or relaxing.

### Space Planning

Before setting up your couch and loveseat, take measurements of your space. You want to ensure that the reclining mechanisms have enough room to operate fully without hitting walls or other furniture. Visualize the layout by using painter's tape to outline where the furniture will go, ensuring it doesn’t overcrowd the area.

### Think Functionality

While style is important, functionality should also be considered. Couch and loveseat reclining combinations are great for maximizing comfort, but think about how they fit into your lifestyle. If you often host gatherings, choose a setup that invites mingling while still accommodating relaxation. You can even include additional seating options like poufs or ottomans for extra space without sacrificing style.

### Mix and Match Styles

Don’t hesitate to mix different styles for a unique look. If your couch is modern, a traditional loveseat can create an interesting contrast. Just make sure to stick with a common color theme or fabric type to avoid clashing. Mixing styles adds character and reflects your personality in the room.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/couch-and-loveseat-reclining  
  
### Regular Maintenance

To keep your couch and loveseat reclining combination looking fresh, regular maintenance is key. Vacuum upholstery to remove dirt and lint, and promptly clean spills to prevent stains. Periodically check the reclining mechanisms for wear and tear to ensure they continue to function smoothly.

By following these strategies, you can create a beautifully styled space that showcases your couch and loveseat reclining combinations while maintaining comfort and functionality. Enjoy your cozy retreat, perfect for both relaxing and entertaining!

### Conclusion

Selecting a couch and loveseat reclining set for your living room is a decision packed with benefits. Not only do these pieces provide unparalleled comfort, making your space an ultimate relaxation zone, but they also enhance the aesthetics of your home. With various styles and designs available, you can easily find the perfect set that speaks to your personal taste while fitting seamlessly into your decor.

While yes there is pain and it hasn’t been fun,  my pain has not been severe enough to make me cry or regret doing this. 

I wanna start by saying your surgery day depends on how you react to anesthesia. I have gone under surgery before somewhat recently and know I get extremely nauseous. I asked them for pills and an anti nausea patch. Which they put on.

11/19 Surgery Day- 
After surgery I wasn’t really in any pain, as my throat was still numb. However, I did have a feeling of something being stuck in my throat, like thick mucus I wanted to “hawk up.” I asked her if I could because of how bothersome it was and she warily said yes. I have a couple bites of applesauce, drink lots of water, and have a feeling on increased thirst, partly because of this.

*This feeling continued and on day 7 I still have, but the severity of it wanes throughout my experience. 

Upon returning home my nausea slowly increases. I take pain pills, I made eggs to help with nausea and drink a protein boost shake thing, which I think was my mistake (milk based) Standing up was making me nauseas as well and I ended up throwing up 4 times. Luckily, it was mostly water and was not painful at all. However, afterwords my throat started to feel a bit sore. Throat and uvula getting more and more swollen. 

Day 1 -11/20
Woke up a bit sore, swelling even more and is the worst part. Most of the only pain I feel is when I swallow. Swelling so bad, I start to lose my voice and go hoarse. Talking starting to hurt. Ate Mac & cheese. I can breathe but some points It’s a bit difficult. (Not in a scary way.) 

Day 2 -11/21
Woke up with pain. This is the worst day so far. I end up loosing voice and can’t talk at all, because of swelling. Ears hurt, neck stiff and aches and headache. Mucus even thicker and have a constant feeling of it being stuck in throat. (I end up massaging neck and jaw and stretching and it helps a ton.)

Day 3 -11/22
Able to talk, feeling better than yesterday. Slight headache still and I contribute to not having caffeine. I make coffee, let it cool just a bit so it’s not so hot and easier to drink. Helps and eases throat. 

Day 4-5- 11/23-11/24
Not much of note. Nothing too bad. I ease up on pain pills, as I’m not hurting as much and haven’t used bathroom yet. Eat soup. The light warmth helps ease throat. Stop pills and stsrt Tylenol.

Day 6- 11/25
I woke up to pain. Best way to describe is the ripping off of a bandaid, but in my throat. I end up taking half a pain pill because it’s hurting and annoying. Scabs starting to come off. I end up spitting out a chunk of it. I end up having some Yawning fits, those are kinda painful, but apparently common after surgery. This is first time I’m feeling real hunger and want big meals/fast food. Burger and fries etc. 

Day 7- 11/26
Today I woke up with sensitivity in throat. Have you ever breathed in cold air and it kinda stings your nose and throat? That’s what it feels like. 
Take a quarter of pain pill to stave off the feeling (finally able to go to bathroom.)
Say screw it and cook ground turkey with some peppers because I’m so hungry. Hurts swallowing and probably won’t do again, but felt nice to eat.  

Helpful tips that have helped TREMENDOUSLY with pain, the mucus feeling, swelling and just overall experience. 

-Drinking water! It’s essential and I keep it next to nightstand and anytime I wake up, I drink. This and ice help TONS with the extra mucus you have. Keeping hydrated will help keep scabs moist, which helps avoid more pain.
-ICE constantly sucking on ice. This helps numb the throat, that it makes swallowing so much easier! At times I can drink water and it feels normal. 
-While Ice is wonderful and necessary, I’ve found having something warm on the throat, helps, especially in the morning when I’m the most sore. This makes it feel better, way that tugging sensation when scans coming off, and then I go straight to sucking on ice cubes.
-Massage. Massaging my neck and underneath the jaw where tonsils are, actually helped a lot with the ear pain and neck pain. (Those pains only lasted half a day at most.) 
-Pain medicine they give you makes a lot of this tolerable. If you need to eat, take pain meds before eating, eating hurts more than drinking when you swallow. It’s uncomfortable and hurts, but not enough to stop me from finishing food.

Yes it sucks and I’ve had some bouts that have been painful, but none of my experience has been so bad as to make me cry out in pain or regret this. I know there’s an end to this and I did this for a reason.

*I will say a lot of my pain is actually coming from my tongue and uvula. Felt like they used my uvula as a punching bag, it felt/feels bruised. The side of my tongue towards the back where tonsils are, is raw, bruised and feels like maybe It’s cut? These have bothered me more than my tonsils have.

Summer is a bit slow to wake up, acting more on automatic for the first bit of the day. She starts her day with some physical activity, like a quick jog, it is generally around halfway through that she feels fully awake.

April-Mae is the fastest one to wake up, like the rest of them she is not one for early mornings but within 5 minutes of waking up she is fully awake.

Autumn will either slap the sleep button repeatedly or get up and sit herself somewhere to do some mindless thing while waiting to be fully awake. She drinks coffee on some days but it is mostly just cream and sugar.

Winter is the hardest and slowest to wake up. Often waking up a good hour after the others are out of bed.

1h0tqxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0tqxt/my_evergrowing_family_threw_me_a_party_after_i/,My ever-growing family threw me a party after I won the lottery. Then the knives came out,"“Family is everything. Always remember that, Jordan.” Those were the words spoken by my parents on my 10th birthday, and they’ve echoed in my mind ever since. Now, as an adult with a psychology degree, struggling to make ends meet, those words felt more like a cruel joke. 



One Monday afternoon, in a moment of desperation, I stopped at a gas station and spent $20 on a scratch off ticket. When I got home and scratched it, my heart nearly stopped. Two million dollars. The numbers stared back at me. Ecstatic, I called my parents to share the news. Their joy matched mine, and they immediately started making plans for a huge family celebration. In retrospect, making that call was the worst mistake I’ve ever made. I should’ve kept it to myself. What happened next left me scarred forever.



It took weeks before I finally deposited the lump-sum check into my account. But as soon as it cleared, the knives came out. 



They threw me a grand dinner party to celebrate, with my parents, and five rough looking cousins I’d never met showed up. Becoming an instant millionaire and spending the night celebrating with loved ones felt like the perfect ending to my story. The table was overflowing with all kinds of food and drinks, but it was the wine that caught my attention. On a good day, I could easily down two to four bottles.



Unfortunately, the joy didn’t last. Things began to take a turn for the worse.



Almost everyone bombarded me with questions—demanding my bank account details and prying into what I planned to do with the money. They were relentless in their curiosity about my future, but I refused to share anything and stepped outside to clear my head. The wine I’d been drinking left a sour taste in my mouth, and a wave of nausea hit me. Stumbling onto the porch, I collapsed and blacked out. 



When I woke up hours later, I groggily got to my feet and went back into the farmhouse. Something was off. The house was shrouded in darkness, and no one was around. It was as if everyone had vanished without a trace. That was when the nightmare truly began.



When lights flickered back on, everyone was seated around the dinner table, staring daggers at me. My mother, Grace, launched into a tirade about how the farmhouse was supposedly days away from foreclosure. But that was a lie, since we paid it off last year through a loan. My father, Mark, pressed me to hand over my bank account details, claiming he was behind on child-support payments to his ex-wives. I held my ground, firmly refusing. My five rough-looking cousins sat in silence; their eyes fixed on me with unsettling intensity. Disgusted, I expressed my deep disappointment to my family and turned to leave, heading for my car.



They jumped on me before I could reach it. Someone jammed a needle into my arm, injecting me with an unknown substance. I blacked out, and when I woke up, it was midnight. I was inside a small-town jail cell, surrounded by two dead cops, with blood coating my hands. I looked up and saw my family members snapping pictures of me from outside the cell. 



Lord almighty, I’d been framed for murder by my own family. I screamed at them to let me out, insisting their plan would fall apart because of the surveillance cameras in the station. But my cousins only laughed, casually pointing out that the jail was old, and the cameras hadn’t worked in years. I froze at the revelation.



They swung open the cell door and advised me to run, cause as of today, I was officially a cop killer whose luck had run out. They bolted out of the police station. 



I stepped out of the cell and examined the bodies of the dead cops. Their throats had been slashed so deeply that the cuts exposed bone. I bolted out of the station after hearing sirens, but I was jumped again, this time by the five rough-looking cousins I’d never met. They injected me with an unknown substance and I passed out.



I jolted awake inside the town’s small church, lying close to the altar. The altar was smeared with flesh and blood. Turning around, I gasped at the rows of dead parishioners sitting in their seats, butchered. My heart pounded so hard it felt unbearable; was this some twisted nightmare, or had I truly killed these people, like the two cops at the station? I didn’t have the answers yet, but I was prepared to fight tooth and nail to uncover the truth.



I stepped out of the church and came face-to-face with a crowd in hooded white robes, their flashlights pointed at me. I considered running into the woods, since the church was deep in a secluded, forested area, but I wasn’t sure I could outrun them. My head throbbed, dizziness blurred my vision, and I felt completely drained, both physically and mentally. That’s when it hit me—what kind of drug had my family injected me with?



I dashed into the woods, glancing back to see if anyone was following. Reaching a clearing, I paused to catch my breath, waiting for the hooded figures to appear, but no one did. I spotted a small shed nearby and slipped inside, taking the chance to relive myself. Just as I finished, a powerful force slammed into the shed, flipping me upside down. It didn’t sound like any animal; it was more like a truck crashing into it. I scrambled out just as the shed tipped over. Before I could steady myself, conjoined twins rushed up to me with a taser, and the next thing I knew, I was on the ground, paralyzed, falling into unconsciousness, again.



I woke up on a stretcher in a decaying medical clinic, a middle-aged nurse with rotten teeth standing beside me. When I asked how I’d ended up here, she stayed silent, her gaze more focused on my pockets than my wellbeing. I got off the stretcher, warning her to stay away from me. She just stared at me, then whispered something chilling—she knew about the lottery I’d cashed recently. And that’s when it hit me: my family, the hooded figures in the forest, conjoined twins in the clearing and now this nurse— they were all after my money.



“I won it! It’s mine!” I shouted, struggling to stay upright. She laughed, exposing her decaying teeth, and murmured a few words that sent a wave of dread through me.



“Family is everything, Jordan,” she whispered, stepping closer to me. But she wasn’t family. I was certain she was bluffing. I turned and bolted out of the clinic, stumbling and nearly collapsing as I crashed to the ground, only to find myself surrounded by smirking bare-chested rednecks aiming their rifles at me. My vision wasn't getting any better and I knew I couldn’t fight them. I let them drag me into the back of their truck. 



The truck drove to the old circus grounds, long shut down over rumors of gambling and human trafficking. 



When I came to my senses, I was on a large wooden stage, staring at my seated parents, the hooded figures, my rough-looking cousins, the nurse with rotten teeth, the conjoined twins who’d tased me in the clearing, and the bare-chested rednecks, all watching me. I stood there on stage, frightened and in tears. How can my parents do this to me? I’ve always had a good relationship with them. At that moment, I wished more than anything to go back in time, to keep my winnings a secret. 



But now, it was too late.



My mother, Grace, addressed me directly. “Wire us the money, Jordan. And I promise you this will all be over soon.”



I stepped to the edge of the stage, my glare cutting through her like a blade. “You framed me for murders I didn’t commit. You’ve destroyed my life.”



They rose from their seats, tambourines in hand, playing with an unsettling enthusiasm. My parents had never touched an instrument in their lives, and I wasn’t about to stick around to find out what this sudden performance was all about. Without hesitation, I leapt off the stage and bolted toward the big top—a massive tent draped in bold red and white stripes. 



Inside, I found piles of dolls and rows of eerily still mannequins. Heart pounding, I crouched among the clutter, hoping to stay hidden. But I was wrong. Some of the mannequins weren’t lifeless props. Their eyes snapped open, glinting with life, and before I could react, they lunged at me, dragging me out of the tent toward the animal pens behind a row of ornate fences.



I screamed and struggled to fight them off. The distant sound of tambourine music still echoed through the air. They dragged me to a pen where a sleeping lion lay and shoved me inside, slamming the gate shut behind me. I looked up at the lion as it let out a low groan in its sleep, its massive body beginning to stir. One of the men, dressed unnervingly like a mannequin, pulled out an iPad, and shoved it through the pen. 



“Direct me to your website’s bank account,” he demanded.



I shook my head firmly. “No.” 



The lion’s eyes fluttered open, staring into my eyes. Holly mother, I was as good as dead.



The beast rose to its feet, towering over me, and leaned in close. Its rough tongue swiped across my sweaty face. I squeezed my teary eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable, but then an odd realization cut through my fear: the circus grounds had been shut down for decades. What were animals still doing here, locked inside cages? And then I wondered? Was any of this even real to begin with? The two dead cops. The lifeless parishioners. The hooded figures in white robes. The bare-chested rednecks. The nurse with rotten teeth. The conjoined twins who had tased me in the forest. And now this circus with caged animals that were closed decades ago. I knew I had been drugged, but maybe it was much worse than that? 



My eyes cracked open, meeting the lion’s unyielding gaze. It tilted its head, then sat back on its haunches. Before I could make sense of it, I noticed something that made my breath catch—a gold necklace hanging around the lion’s neck. It looked strikingly similar to the one my mother, Grace, always wore. What an odd coincidence, I thought. But I couldn’t shake the feeling. I had to be sure. So, I asked a crazy question.



“Mom? Is that…you?”



The men in mannequin costumes hissed at each other in hushed tones, their frustration clearly visible. The lion became irritated, slamming itself against the pen. 



The men rushed into the pen, restraining me. One of them jabbed a needle into my arm. The world around me dissolved into darkness—again.



I woke up, naked, lying in the middle of the street under the cover of night. My mother, Grace, sat eerily still beside me, her eyes closed as if in deep slumber. I staggered to my feet and her eyes cracked open, locking into mine. Her lips parted slowly, unnervingly wide, as she pushed her hand into her mouth. When she pulled it back out, a writhing snake dangled from her grasp. 



I screamed and bolted down the street, glancing over my shoulder to see if she followed. I reached a fence and scrambled over it and ran into the woods until the outline of our farmhouse emerged through the darkness. I ran into the main house, climbed up the stairs, found some clothes in my room and suited up.  



As I descended the stairs toward the living room, I saw my parents, plus everyone else, seated at the dinner table, each with a cup of coffee in hand, whispering in hushed tones. I joined them in silence, seething, but powerless against my predicament. 



Suddenly, they slowly turned their necks toward me, and began speaking in an eerie, guttural language. And that’s when I remembered. **Witchcraft**. My eyes widened as a memory surfaced—my grandmother had dabbled in witchcraft during her teenage years and surely had passed her teachings to my mother. Their words grew louder, dripping with malice. My body betrayed me, blood began to trickle down my scalp, seeped from my nose and poured from my mouth. 



And then I wondered? What if this wasn’t real as I suspected? What if I was a puppet in their dark ritual, controlled through witchcraft?



There was no time to dwell on the thought. My body lifted off the floor, floating helplessly in the air.



“I’ll give you what you want. Please, stop! It’s all yours!” I cried out.



I dropped like a stone on the floor, grimacing in pain, looking up, seeing their faces twisted in triumph. Their joy was evident, they’d finally got what they asked for. But they couldn’t be more wrong. I staggered to my feet with a devious scheme in mind. 



One of my cousins slid a note and pen across the table, expecting me to scrawl my bank information. Instead, I gripped the pen and lunged forward, driving it straight into my mother’s eye. The makeup of the room began to change. The walls shimmered and warped, pulsing as if alive. My family screamed, their voices deafening, as one by one, they vanished from their chairs.



I woke up in the bathroom, my mother lying beside me, unconscious. I jolted upright and scanned the room. My God! My own mother, with the help of my family, had practiced witchcraft on me, to get after the lottery money I’d won. I walked out of the bathroom, slipped into the hall and started hearing joyful voices. 



I looked down and saw my parents seated at the dinner table, plus, the nurse with decaying teeth, the rough-looking cousins, the conjoined twins who’d tased me, the bare-chested rednecks, and a small crowd of people cloaked in white robes.



I knew there was no way out of here without a bruising fight, but I had no intention of hurting anyone. Desperate for a moment to think, I slipped into hiding in the library—a small adjacent room. I scanned the shelves, crammed with books and family albums. 



My eyes fell on one of the albums, and curiosity got the better of me. I opened it, flipping through the pages. My heart sank. Staring back at me were faces I recognized. 



On one page, I saw a photo of myself as a child, standing outside a farmhouse beside a teenage girl with decaying teeth. She bore an uncanny resemblance to the nurse with the rotten smile. 



I turned the page, and my stomach churned. The conjoined twins who had tased me were in another photograph, standing next to me and my mother, as if they were a happy couple inside a mechanic shop. 



And it didn’t stop there.  



The town’s sheriff. The two deputies. Even the people in white robes from the dinner table. 



And then, there was the last page. 



What I saw made me stumble backward, collapsing onto the floor. Recoiling in complete horror and disgust.



It was a photo of me as a newborn.



I was cradled in my mother’s arms, surrounded by familiar faces. The younger conjoined twins stood proudly at her side. My father, Mark, was there too, along with a crowd of rough-looking teenage cousins and everyone else(sheriff, deputies, parishioners, bare-chested teenagers and younger faces I recognized at the dinner table wearing white robes). 



There was a scribble at the bottom of the page:



*Jordan Summers. Welcome to our ever-growing family.*



Silence tore me apart, then the tears came. The horrifying truth settled in—I had been born into some twisted, incestuous, religious, redneck nightmare of a family.



There was no time to waste. I had to escape. I opened the door cautiously, but the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs froze me in place. They were heading to the bathroom to check on my mother. I closed the door and rushed to the window. 



Outside, an unattended horse stood near the farmhouse entrance, its reins slack. I pushed the window open and slipped onto the roof. The drop below was steep.



I heard a commotion inside—they had found my mother.



I jumped. Pain shot through me as I landed hard on the ground, my leg snapping under the impact. I dragged myself to the horse, hauled myself into the saddle, and urged it into a gallop. Through the dense woods, I rode for what felt like hours, not caring where I was going, as long as it was far away from the farmhouse.



I emerged onto a road and followed it until I reached a bus station in the next town. With the last few dollars in my wallet, I bought a one-way ticket to Oregon. 



Once there, I started over. I changed my name, my social security number, and opened a new bank account with my hidden wealth. I dyed my hair pink and started wearing nose-rings. I found a small, cheap apartment and lived like a ghost, severing all ties to my family and former life. 



I kept my mouth shut and avoided anyone who might pry into my past.



But life had other plans.



I eventually found love, and within a year, Trinity and I were married. We bought a small farmhouse, miles away from the city.



My life was better. Peaceful. But the past never truly left me.



I was scarred forever.



And to those of you wondering if I ever told my wife about the lottery I had won.



A secret is a secret. 



I kept it to myself.

But some days, depending on what I eat, I don't even feel hungry enough to eat more. Should I just eat any way to get my body enough calories or does not feeling hungry mean I don't need them?
This usually happens when I'm eating whole foods so I get a lot of fiber and protein which I know makes you feel fuller. I also tend to have a coffee in the morning which reduces my appetite.
Most days I'll eat 1500ish or more.
I definitely lose weight when I'm undereating, but it's just confusing when people say that amount isn't healthy, but my body isn't telling me it's hungry.

tl;dr: i love my setup & have chosen to cash out on beans until i consider picking up what is my endgame setup

So back in March I got an espresso machine for my birthday. I thought of it as this simple thing, make a couple of cups, every few days, figure out how to work it, find a cup of coffee I like, then chug that until I can no longer stand it.

I found that to be far from the truth & I opened a black hole & got sucked in. I started by buying a WDT after watching videos from guys like Lance Hedrick & Daddy Hoffman. I find out about RDT. I discover the importance of having a level puck, a clean puck. I discover flow of water, how fast the water is flowing, is your water clean enough for espresso.

I even learn to make mock espresso w the moka pot. I am STILL learning. Every day. I am also STILL trying to improve my latte art :)

I have found amazing tasty beans for my personal flavor preferences & even found beans I want to come back to (assuming I haven't developed my palate enough FOR those beans)

But I have also found a (somewhat) happy medium for what I would call my budget endgame setup & probably won't be looking to upgrade until I want to COMPLETELY shell out on my dream setup, which is probably WAY out there for me as far as price goes.

I might swap out the kitchen towels for black towels so they fit, but other than that I think I am done (until I am willing to cash out on a better machine)

So I’d say I'm probably at the point of diminishing returns. Love y'all & I won’t be shelling out on gear, but will probably be shelling out on beans for the next while :)

1h0te11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1h0te11/advice_for_when_to_cycle_off_anti_fungals_please/,Advice for when to cycle off anti fungals please!,"So I recently realized that there EXTREME mental and emotional issues that had me in absolute agony for like the past 3 weeks straight all were symptoms of die off. I decided to take a couple days off the anti fugals and do a coffee enema to try and hell all those horrible toxins out. And OH MY, it literally saved my life. So now Ive decided I cannot slow the die off toxins to build up to much otherwise I will literally want to die. It’s so gnarly. The problem is I tried doing another coffee enema today, but I’m too inflamed down there now and something is literally blocking the coffee enema. I’m not too concerned about it, it’s probably because I have had diarrhea everday for the past 3 months lol. But what concerns me is now what in the world do I do when it comes time to start some anti fungals again?

I know I can promote detox from doing bile pushes, so I’m gonna try adding those daily. I also have just the SLIGHTEST amount of energy now because of the coffee enema I did, so I think I can try working out a bit at home to sweat some toxins out. But I don’t think that will be enough to prevent the HORRENDOUS die off symptoms when I start taking the anti fungals again. And it goes without saying that I can’t rely on coffee enemas which would easily get me through it.

So my questions are; how can I detox as much as physically possible to avoid the horrendous symptoms when I need to take anti fungals. And also, how often can I cycle off them to give myself a break? Every other week? Once a week? Twice a week? I have no clue, I’ve just been consistently taking them for like 2 months and that’s probably why I was suffering so bad. So if anyone knows how I can take just the right amount, and cycle in and off perfectly to avoid both Candida coming back AND die off symptoms, please lmk!

1h0tcrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1h0tcrv/working_from_home_and_being_bored_got_me_in_over/,Working from home and being bored got me in over my head,So I graduated from college about 4 years ago and as of about a year ago I got my first work from home bullshit email job. It’s been glorious honestly. I go on walks or do some of my reps while on conference calls and if I get lonely I just go work from a coffee shop down the block from my apartment. The real downside is that I’m just super fucking bored most of the day. Outside of meetings I barely have like 2 hours of work to do most days and end up spending time just scrolling through Instagram or if I’m really bored facebook. Well occasionally I’ll see a local group recommended to me that’s like “Idaho Police Wives United” or “Blue Collar baddie gfs”. One day my curiosity got the better of me and I wrote a post pretending to be interested in becoming a cop because my job was boring but I was worried about how it might affect my relationship with my gf since its “had it’s ups and downs”. I don’t even have a gf right now but I thought it would explain why I was posting in the group. Anyways I got a couple responses but one woman said I could IM her if I had any more questions. Well of course she was just talking to me cause she was really lonely and in an unhappy marriage. We spent the next couple weeks or so talking and I figured I would just get some pictures out of it. I even pretend to break up with my imaginary girlfriend. Well after a month or so we started sending each other pictures. Nothing too explicit just pics after getting out of the shower and some of my dick showing through my pants. I told her how lonely it was working from home “now that I am single” and she invited me to come work from her house anytime her husbands on duty. I honestly didn’t expect it to get this far and I was just doing it to kill time but now I’m honestly wondering if I should go through with this. I don’t think she really wants a relationship but still is it wrong to do? I really could just go and fuck her without even having to take PTO.,2,1732673138.0,redscarepod,1,1.0,False

“Well, Sir, it wuz, ohhhhhhh ... bout 1985, I reckon it were. I wuz jest gettin back to the house after a long night of runnin shine at the old still site. A bunch of weird shit went on that night. It wuz like I kept a’hearin voices in the woods. Now, I ain’t speaking bout no human voices. Nor am I speaking Sasquatch voices. They wuz high squeaky voices, and creepy and sech. I got the impression they wuz tryin to call me off into the woods. Of course, I had a haid full of acid during my shine run, so I didn’t really pay the voices no mind. But still, there wuz sumthang bout these here voices. They twernt the usual voices I wuld hear.”

“So, I git back to the house. I decided to relax a bit before bed. I warmed me up a leftover Sasquatch burger to eat. Then I kicked back in my Lazy-Boy that I stole, and scorched a fat doob while I watched “Anal Intruder 14” (My favorite of the series) on VHS. Then there wuz a knock at my door. ‘Goddamn it!!’, I thought, ‘Who’s knocking on my door at 7am in the morn?!?’”

“When I opened the damn door I found old Sheriff standing thar. I sed ‘Goddamn it, you fat sumbitch! What the fuck are you doing bothering me this early in the morning?!?’ Sheriff sed ‘Look, Roy, I know it’s early, but I am here on official business. Old Mrs. Miller called. Her old man, old “Big Cock from Talking Rock” didn’t come home last night. He went out coon hunting near here but didn’t show up for breakfast. Have you seen him?’ I told Sheriff I ain’t seen shit, then shut the door. But old Sheriff stuck his foot inside the door jam to keep me from closing my door.”

“I gave old Sheriff a look like I wuz pissed, and I wuz. Then he put up his hand and sed ‘Roy, please?’ I could see that the sumbitch wuz troubled, so I sed ‘Well shit, you may as well come on inside and tell me about it.’ “

“Sheriff sat down on the couch while I sat back down in my Lazy-Boy. Sheriff asked ‘Is that one of them Lazy-Boy recliners? Man, they sure is comfortable. I used to have one, but some sumbitch broke into my house recently and stole mine. I sure would like to catch that miscreant!’ I looked at Sheriff and sed ‘Prolly darkies. They will steal everything not nailed down.’ ‘Yep’, agreed Sheriff.”

“I asked ‘What’s troubling ya, Sheriff?’ Sheriff sighed, then started in. ‘Well, Roy, Mrs. Miller told me some troubling things, and ... uh, Roy, could you put your dick away while we talk?’ I asked Sheriff if he wanted me to turn off “Anal Intruder 14” too, and he said he did. So I shut off my Zenith and put my thumpin stick away. 

“Sheriff continued, ‘Mrs. Miller claims old Big Cock has been talking all crazy, about hearing malevolent voices in the woods at night. He even said he saw some little green men and that they were the source of the voices. Roy, I don’t want to tell you this, but old Big Cock thought these little green fellas meant to kill him.’

“Then Sheriff sed ‘Roy? ROY!!!’ I had nodded off, so I made Sheriff repeat hisself. When he finished he asked, ‘Well, what do ya think, Roy?’ I held up two fangers and sed ‘Two thangs, Sheriff. First, you need to stop assuming that I give a fuck about your shit. You need to pull up yer big girl panties and do yer goddamn job. I ain’t yer fucking daddy. Two, I like old Big Cock, so instead of giving you the ass whuppin you deserve, I is gonna hep ya.’” 

“Then I asked, ‘Sheriff, you ever heard talk of the Pukwudgie?’ Sheriff thought fer a moment, rubbing his chin and narrowing his eyes. I then sed to Sheriff ‘You don’t know what the fuck a Pukwudgie is, dumbass. Quit acting like you is trying to think.’ ‘Sorry Roy’, sed the Sheriff. I retorted, ‘Yep, you IS a sorry sumbitch.’”

“By this point I’d had enough of this shit-head, so I pulled out my lil old Sig P226 outa my conceal holster I have sewn into my taint and pointed it right at Sheriff’s head. Sheriff’s eyes grew bigger than 2 dinner plates. He starts crying out ‘ROY? NOOOOOOO!!!!!! BIG COCK!!!!!! REMEMBER???? BIG COCK!!!!!!’ Then I thought about “Old Big Cock From Talking Rock”. I lowered my pistol.” 

“Old Big Cock and I met in Vietnam, during the war. I wuz at this here whore house called “The Slanted Crack”, jest a bangin away on sum sweet, young oriental thang when I heard a voice from behind me say ‘She’s dead’. I thought ‘What the fuck?’, but kept on pounding that gook. Then the voice sed ‘Dude, I told you, that chick is dead.’ I turned around and thar stood Old Big Cock From Table Rock.”

“I sed ‘What the fuck is you talking about, GI?’ That’s when BC walked up and sed ‘Yeah, dude, I fucked that bitch. Then I shot her in the top of her head.’ I looked down at the bitch. I guessed it made sense because she was not really participating. I looked back up at BC and asked him why he shot the bitch. BC sed, ‘Well, I figured that she just fucked me, so I owed her a fucking, so BOOM!! Yer fucked! Heh heh heh!!!’ After that, BC and I hung tight.”

“Eventually we got separated, as I got assigned to a unit sent into Cambodia to do sum nasty business. BC and I lost touch. Then, low and behold, I ran into him after the war at the feed store whar I wuz buyin sum corn fer a batch of shine. He jest happened to move into town fer sum white-bread job. By then he already got him a wife and family and turned to God.”

“Of course, old BC could not reconcile his newfound belief structure with my Satanic worship, shine runnin, whorin, and racist-terrorism lifestyle, so we did not really hang anymore. Of course, it wuz that old whore he married that got him on the straight and narrow. The old BC I remember from Nam wuz all about banging slanty eyes, knifing Cong, and blowing up children’s hospitals. He shore had changed.”

“But I do not begrudge BC a good family life. It ain’t fer ME, mind ya. But that damn war changed a lot of folks. If’n family is what BC needed, then so be it. I would still run into old BC in town from time to time. We wuz both friendly, and genuinely glad to see one another. But ever time I brung up the war he just got quiet and sed he didn’t want to talk about it.”

“Now, sir, I reckon most folks who wuz in Nam try to ferget. I cannot blame ‘em. It ‘twas pure hell. But yer old Roy has sum pretty good coping mechanisms, so it did not get on top of me like it did sum fellers. Fact is, and I am not ashamed to admit it, I had me a fucking blast in Nam! I got to hang out of choppers, firing machine guns at those little fuckers on the ground. There wuz non-stop whoring and fighting. Fer a poor old southern country boy from the hills, it was goddamn exciting!!”

“But I still got a soft spot fer old BC. We had us sum good times together, we did. There wuz this one time we stopped a caravan of trucks on this little mule path of a road in the jungle. We figured they may be moving soldiers and weapons to the enemy, so we stopped it. BC went to check on the cargo in the first truck. He radioed to us and sed ‘Well, they ain’t exactly Cong’. But due to the shitty radio BC wuz a’carryin, we only heard ‘EXACTLY ... CONG’. So we stormed the caravan and shot ever living thang in them trucks. We lit ‘em up!!”

“Turned out it wuz a caravan of local kids being bussed to a school. Whoops!! The CO blamed BC, who blamed his radio. 33 Vietnamese kids snuffed, and all because of a misunderstanding. Ha ha ha ha!!! The CO let BC off the hook. He was happy that these little fuckers now would not have a chance to grow up and shoot back at us. Shit like this kind of gave Old Big Cock a conscience, I thinks.” 

“There wuz this other time in Nam when sum us guys got sent to a native hospital to vaccinate sum thar little kids. Old BC and I decided to have us sum fun. Whilst all them lil gooks wuz in the tent getting thar shots, we lit up sum firecrackers and tossed them in the tent. Well, Sir, one them grown-up gooks had a gun. He apparently mistook the firecrackers fer gunshots, so he showed his jammy.”

“That did not go over well with our GIs in the tent. The boys standing guard opened fire on the grown-up gook with their M-16s, taking out 5-6 kids in addition to their intended target. We all know them thar little gooks are sumtimes booby trapped with explosives. Not wanting to take any chances, I grabbed my M-16, stepped into the tent, and yelled ‘BOMB!!’ At that point, everyone opened fire!!” 

“Well, once we got dun stacking up all the dead gook kids, we realized there wuz no bomb. The CO called me over and demanded to know why I screamed ‘bomb’. He screamed at me, ‘YOU COCKSUCKING HILLBILLY F#GGOT SON OF A BITCH!! DID YOU EVEN SEE A BOMB?’ I sed ‘No Sir!’. He continued, ‘THEN WHY IN THE HELL DID YOU YELL “BOMB” AND GET ALL THESE CHILDREN KILLED?’ I replied, ‘Sir, them lil swarthy gooks are always booby trapping thar kids. I figured it would save the lives of our good old American boys if’n we jest cut to the chase and eliminate the threat altogether, Sir.’”

“The CO thought a moment, the sed ‘GOOD THINKING, SOLDIER! GOOD THINKING!!! KEEP IT UP!’, then he patted me on the shoulder and that wuz the last I heard of it. I found old BC sitting on the ground holding one them dead gooks. He had tears streaming down his face.”

“I sed, ‘Goddamn, BC, you look like you is due fer the Thorazine Tent. The fuck is wrong with you?’ Old BC picked up a little severed leg and a little severed arm that apparently belonged to the mini gook he wuz a’holdin. With tears coming out of his eyes, Old Big Cock whimpered ‘I can’t put him back together. I can’t put him back together. I can’t put him back together. I CAN’T PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER!!! I CAN’T PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER!!!!!!’ “

“I sed to myself ‘Yikes! This sumbitch has snapped!’ I took old BC’s guns, then had a word with the CO about Big Cock’s condition. The CO told me ‘BASH THAT SICK FUCKER OVER THE HEAD, TIE HIM UP, AND THROW HIM IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. WE’LL SHIP HIM OFF FOR EVALUATION LATER.  NOW, LET’S GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. MOVE! MOVE!! MOVE!! MOVE!! MOVE!! MOVE!!” 

“That wuz the last I saw of BC until he showed up here in town. He got shipped off to the funny farm hospital. But they wouldn’t send him home. They had him pushing a broom and cuttin taters and sech, just no more combat,  and no guns.”

“After reminiscing, I looked at old Sheriff and sed, ‘I reckon I need to see what I can do fer old Big Cock. Whar the fuck his old lady at? I need to talk to her. Sheriff asked ‘Do ya think that’s a good idea, Roy? She’s real tore up.’ I picked up the carved stone ash tray on the table next to my chair and slung it hard at Sheriff’s head. THUMP!!!! It gave him a nice, bloody gash in his forehead. Sheriff let out a howl, ‘OHHHHHHHHH!!! Goddamn, Roy! That hurts! Why did you do that?’ I sed ‘Don’t ever question me, snot-head. Now shut the fuck up and let’s go see BC’s bitch.’”

“It took us about an hour to get to BC’s house. It twere jest an average looking, white bread house. The lawn was manicured, there were a white picket fence, and 2 little statues of a couple nicely dressed negro fellers in the front yard. As Sheriff knocked on the front door, I whipped out my cock to take a piss off the porch. Sheriff musta heard the tinkling sound cuz he turned and sed ‘Roy!! What are you doing?!? STOP THAT!’ With my right hand, I gave him a stern back-handed bitch slap across his fat face. WHAPPP!!!! Then I sed ‘Shut up.’ About that time the door opened.” 

“Old Mrs. Miller opened the door just as I wuz putting my cock back in my pants. Sheriff sed ‘Hello Mrs. Miller. I brought along an old friend of your husband, Roy. He lives back up in Sasquatch Hollar, near where John had been coon hunting.” Mrs. Miller sed ‘Yes, I know Roy. He was in the service with my John, in Vietnam.’ The little woman wuz not too fond of me cuz soon after they moved to town I picked up BC one afternoon, got him all coked up and ended up crashing his BMW into Bigfoot River with a dead stripper in the trunk.”

“I sed ‘Why hello there, Mrs. Miller. Sheriff here has been telling me about your husband and his problems. I came to see if’n I can help.’ Despite her feelings about me, she seemed genuinely glad I wuz here. We went inside the house and sat down. Mrs. Miller served us coffee, then we started talking.”

“Just like Sheriff has told me, old Big Cock had been acting funny lately. He started acting paranoid and talking about little green men in the woods. They wuz whispering to him in the dark woods and beckoning him to follow, though he never did. His wife sed she tried to keep him at home, but that BC sed they were calling him and he had to go; he had to find out what they wanted. He had to follow them. Clearly his wife was really concerned, but it sounds like there wuz nothing she could do to stop him from returning to those dark woods to try and break the spell they had on him.”

“Sheriff then told Mrs. Miller that I wuz an ex-commando and that I specialized in paranormal occurrences and investigations. The poor, desperate old lady looked to me with big, doe eyes hoping that I had something to say that would ease her mind, and maybe help find her beloved man. Mrs. Miller gently asked me, ‘Roy, do you think John is still ... alive?’”

“I replied, ‘Fuck no. That sumbitch is dead as hell.’ Poor Mrs. Miller went to crying hysterically. Sheriff scolded me fer being blunt with the woman. When he got her settled down she asked me what I knew of what happened. I guess I owed the old woman an explanation.”

“So I sed, ‘Look, I don’t know fer sure if old Big Cock is still alive or not ...’ Then Mrs. Miller interrupted me, saying ‘...John. Please call him John.’ I said ok. Then I continued, ‘The thang is that from everthang you and Sheriff been telling me, this is a case of the Pukwudgie.’”

“Mrs. Miller did not understand. So I explained to her that the Pukwudgie, or the little people, are small, green demonic people that live in the woods. They hate humans, and try to lure them to their deaths. Mrs. Miller looked terribly shocked. She asked ‘Are these things... these Pukwudgie, are they ... REAL?’ I sed ‘Shit yeah, they is real, woman. I seen ‘em. Best thang to do is to ignore ‘em. Well, that, and shoot the little bastards.’” 

“I continued, ‘Yessir, I have seen those little peckers. You will be out thar in the deep, dark woods, runnin shine, or huntin, er fishin, or performing some Satanic magic, then you start hearing talking. It starts out real low. It sounds like a conversation between 2 or more of them, but you cannot understand them because they is speaking so fast.’”

“I went on, ‘Then, all a sudden, they call out yer name. That’s when shit starts gettin REALLY creepy. They get yer attention and then they call you to them. They will show themselves to ya if you follow their call. They is sum ugly motherfuckers too. They stand about 3 feet tall and look like little green trolls. Then, once you have contact with them, they try to lead you off into the woods. Some say that they want to lead you off so they can kill ya. I guess they ambush ya er sumthang. When I see one I usually pull my pistol and blow their heads to bits. It explodes like a cantaloupe, but it splatters this green goo.’”

“Mrs. Miller asked, ‘So, you have never followed on of these ...Pukwudgie... off into the woods?’ I sed ‘Hell no. I kill the little fuckers. BUT, they been known to get inside yer head and put a spell on you to whar ya can’t resist thar call. In that case, they lead ya off into the woods and you are never seen er heard from again ... ever.’”

“I know this wuz troubling news for Mrs. Miller, but she needed to hear the truth. After a few moments of silence, Mrs Miller asked if I would go to the woods where Big Cock went coon hunting and see if I could either find him or find his body and return it to her fer a proper Christian burial.”

“I sed ‘Look, I like Old Big Cock....uh, I mean, John. But if the Pukwudgie got him, then there prolly won’t be no sign left. They would drag him off into some underground lair.’ Then Mrs. Miller pleaded with me. She sed ‘Look, we don’t have a lot of money, but I could pay you. How about ... $5,000.00? I just got to know.’ I still wuz not eager to go about fucking with them thar sneaky little critters. But Mrs. Miller wuz getting real desperate. I wuz feeling sorta sorry fer her. I also felt some sense of duty to Big Cock, a fellow soldier.”

“I came to a conclusion. I sed ‘Ok, Mrs Miller, I will do it. I will try to find yer husband, or at least what happened to him out thar, but on 2 conditions.’ Mrs. Miller eagerly nodded. I continued, ‘First, you pays me my $5k up front, as in now.’ She sed ‘Done. I have the cash upstairs. What is the second condition?’”

“I sed ‘The second condition is that you go into that kitchen over thar, drop your drawers and bend over the table so I can fuck ya.’ Mrs. Miller’s face sank, and tears started rolling down her face. Softly she spoke, ‘John always said you are an evil man, Roy. He said you do not know the Lord. He said you did horrible things in Vietnam. Now I believe him.”

“As Mrs. Miller is talking I glance at my watch. Goddamn, it wuz noon already and I still ain’t got no sleep after last night’s shine run. Then I remembered the voices. I heard them motherfuckers last night at the Still site!”

“I butted Into Mrs. Miller’s evangelical bullshit and sed ‘I know whar they is! Those Pukwudgie were calling me last night at my Still site, which was when Old Big Cock went missing in the same general area. I thought I wuz jest high - and I wuz - but those were the weird, outa the ordinary voices I heard.’ Now I had Mrs. Miller’s attention. Even old Sheriff wuz on the edge of his seat.”

“Mrs Miller excitedly asked me would I go get her husband. She sed ‘Oh, sweet Jesus, Roy, you KNOW where he is. Will you go? Will you please go?’ I sed ‘Yep, I’ll go, and I will kill ever last one of then Pukwudgie critters. If John is thar, I will git him.’” 

“Then I sed, ‘Mrs. Miller, ya’ll don’t got to pay me none. Old Big Cock is my friend. So you can keep yer money.’ She nodded, with hope in her eyes. Then I sed ‘Now git yer ass in the kitchen.’ She looked stunned. I sed, ‘Bitch, I may be not gonna charge ya, but I is still gonna fuck ya. So git in that thar kitchen and git yer britches off! The longer you take, the longer it will take me to find Old Big Cock!!’ She sheepishly did as she was told.” 

“After I nutted in Mrs. Miller’s cooter, I told Sheriff to give me the keys to his police cruiser. He sed ‘Roy, you know I can’t do that.’ Then BAMMM!!!!  I punched that prick right in the throat. He went down like a sack of taters. As he was lying there, desperately gasping fer breath, I fished his car keys out of his pocket and took his pistol. Then I walked out the door, leaving Sheriff writhing on the floor, and Mrs. Miller lying in fetal position and sobbing on the kitchen floor. I checked Sheriff’s pistol. It was a .380. I stopped in my tracks and sed ‘This is f#ggot shit!!’, then tossed the cheap, pussy gun on Mrs. Miller’s front lawn. I got into Sheriff’s car and then headed back to Sasquatch Hollar. I figured I would get me sum real firepower and then go kill sum Pukwudgie. On the drive I wondered how those little critters would taste grilled.”

“So I got back home and prepared to do my loadout. Fer you f#ggot-homosexuals out thar, that means getting reddy fer battle. I went into the house and the first thang I did wuz put on some fightin’ music on my music player. I chose some Dying Fetus, which be sum extreme deth metal. I stuck the CD in the player then cranked that sumbitch loud enuff old Satan hisself had to cover his ears. I wanted to get inta the mood, if’n ya knows what I mean. Next wuz my vest. It is a Russian tactical belt/vest I pulled off a dead commie bastard.  I fucking hate commies! Then come the blades: 2 ProTech Godfather switchum blades and a big old Kabar. Finally, it wuz time fer the guns.”

“But before I could do my gun load-out, I had to change CDs to enhance my mood. I took out the Dying Fetus and replaced it with Goatwhore, cranked so fucking loud that even the angels above will have debilitating tinnitus. Then came the guns.”

“Them Pukwudgies are little and sneaky. I am gonna need a shotgun fer this hunt. But I also want shell capacity. So I went to my safe and pulled out my Saiga 12. I loaded some drums with 3” magnums in double-ought buckshot. This setup will literally shred them little munchkins to pieces.”

“Next came my backup weapon. Since we weren’t talking bout anything big, I pulled out my Sig M400 AR-15. It wuz already loaded wit a 60 round mag. I grabbed me 5 more loaded 60s, all green tips. Next wuz my sidearm. Again, small pussy targets. I had the PERFECT choice: My FN Five-seveN! I put that sumbitch in a holster and on my gun belt, with 2 extra 20 round mags. Those 5.7s will gut the little monsters.” 

“Now fer my backup handgun. I chose my CZ75 SP-01. My particular one had 18+1 capacity. I just stuck this fucker and 2 extra mags in my belt, privateer style! Finally, jest fer Insurance, I got out my Kimber micro-9s. These are basically pocket guns of last resort. I sticks em in my overalls’ front pockets.”

“Then came the piece-de-la-resistance: My Ruger Super Redhawk revolver chambered fer .480 cartridges and with an 8 inch barrel. This wuz my true LAST RESORT CCW piece. I pulled down my drawers and inserted this big beautiful bastard right up my ass, barrel first, fer Deep Concealed Carry. I let the handle stay on the outside and fit it snug up into my taint. Then I put my draws back on and suited up.”

“I headed straight fer my still site. By now it wuz 3 pm. Them lil fuck-faces won’t come out until after dark. Like I dun sed, I ain’t been to sleep. So I thought, fuck it, I’ll lean up agin one these old hardwood trees and gits me sum shut eye while waitin fer dark.” 

“I woke up just as the sun wuz settin, feeling this sharp pain in my nethers. I looked down and found a squirrel chewing on my nuts! I snatched that motherfucker up by its neck and sed ‘You mangy sumbitch!’, then SNAP!!!! I broke its neck. I then built myself a fire and skinned and gutted the critter. He wuz gonna be my dinner!”

“As I went about my business I wondered how my balls had flopped outa my overalls. I knew Pukwudgie were in the area. I also knew something else bout these buggers....something I didn’t tell Mrs. Miller. These Pukwudgie are sexual deviants who will molest ya. Ya see, I thought I wuz safe till dark. But I wuz wrong. Those fuckers were already out and about. Most likely I had one or more watching me this very moment!” 

“Well, I roasted the squirrel then ate it, washing it down with shine from my tactical flask that says “BIGFOOT SLAYER!” on it. I stayed real still and as motionless as possible while I ate, like I had no idea I wuz being watched. I could hear that little bastard tip-toeing around me in the woods. That ball-fondling dwarf Pukwudgie f#ggot!”

“What struck me as odd is why these little motherfuckers chose jest now to show up here. I’m out in these here wood all the time, but have not seen ‘em in a long time. Hmmmmm ...”

“Then came the speaking, the odd, indecipherable language. I laid back agin a tree and closed my eyes. Eventually the midget-speak wore down. Then it got quiet. It wuz too quiet, in fact. Then, as if someone was right up at my ear whispering forcefully, I heard ‘ROY!!’ I sprang to attention, scairt shitless. Even though I wuz expecting it, it wuz still a fucking shock.” 

“I started creeping around, outside of the light of the fire. It wuz blacker than a nigg*r out in these here woods. By now it was a quarter to 8. Then I heard the voice again. It sed ‘ROY!’ It was clearly from one of them Pukwudgies. You can always tell them, as they sound like Muppets on acid. I moved toward the direction of the voice.”

“I pushed through sum heavy brush and briars, then came out into a little opening. Thar it wuz. Right in front of me wuz one of these little leprechaun motherfuckers. It wuz green and seemed to glow slightly. It wuz sneering at me, then sed ‘Come, this way, Roy’, as it motioned me toward a path into the dark woods. I figured I ought not kill it cuz I need info on Old Big Cock. Of course, that did not mean I could not cripple it.”

“I snapped up my scatter gun and fired ...BOOM!! I shot the lil puppet monster below it’s waste, completely shredding its little legs with the buck shot. I walked over and stood over it as it wuz writhing in pain. Then the craziest dang thang happened: it opened its eyes, looked up at me and started talking. Now, one may think these Pukwudgie would start casting evil spells and shit when cornered. But this one wuz different.”

“The Pukwudgie looked up at me and sed ‘Why did you blow off my legs, you sick motherfucker?’ It has a high pitched, cartoony voice. I told the critter to watch its mouth or I would blow that off too. But the wounded Pukwudgie kept on, saying ‘I can’t even walk now, you stupid fucking hick! Couldn’t you have found a goat to fuck tonight so you would not have to be out here turning my legs into shredded wheat, you ass-eating cock-sucker?’ I wuz a little taken back by its language.”

“I then stepped on the little prick’s lame legs and put all my force on them. The Pukwudgie let out a powerful scream of pain. Then I asked it about Old Big Cock. We went round and round, with the munchkin not giving up any intel. So I settled on a course of action. BLAMMMM!!! Another blast from my scattergun and this little twat no longer had a head.”

“I looked around what wuz left of it. He had sum funny looking leprechaun clothing on. Honestly, it wuz dressed like one of them thar Canadian figure skater homos. I searched the pockets and pulled out a wad of paper. It be nuthin but trash it had picked up and stuffed into its pockets. What an asshole.”

“So thar I wuz, in the middle of the dark woods with a dismembered Pukwudgie. My only lead is dead. But afore I tossed all that wadded up paper from the critter’s pocket, sumthang caught my eye. It wuz sumthang hard and metallic. I cut my sure-fire flashlighter on. It wuz sum motherfucking dog tags, like what ever soldier is issued. I looked closely. What I dun read from those tags almost made me shit a brick. The name on the tag was ‘John Miller’. SHIT!!! These are Old Big Cock’s dog tags! That creepy little varmint jacked these dog tags from BC!!”

“Then all hell broke loose. There came a huge commotion from all around me. Several of those little Pygmy voices were chanting ‘Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy...’ I had a bad feeling about this. Then, all at once, they charged me, from all sides. Turned out thar were five of them Pukwudgies, and they were coming at me and carrying little weapons.”

“I just tore into sum hysterical laughing at the sight. They wuz just cuter than fuck!! They wuz like puppets carrying toy swords, and sticks and sech. It wuz hilarious! All five of em stopped within a couple feet of me, perplexed by my uncontrollable laughing. They jest stood around me and looking at each other. Apparently they had never seen sech a sight. Most of thar victims turn and high-tail it in terror. But I didn’t. Finally, one of the Pukwudgies spoke.”

“This real little one looked like he wuz dressed up to be a riverboat card dealer and he carried a sharpened stick. Speaking to me in a voice that sounded like Grover from Sesame Street, it sed ‘Roy, you do not run. Are you not fearful that your life may be lost?’ That just caused me to laugh ten times harder. Again, they started looking at each other. Then the one behind me and carrying a tiny pitch fork came up and jabbed me in the ass with it. Then it demanded to know why I wuz laughing.”

“I finally got my laughing under control and got quiet and caught my breath. I then turned around to look at the little pecker that just stabbed me in my ass. It wuz dressed up like a little wizard, with sequins and a purple robe, like it had jest escaped from a gay pride parade. I lost it, and started laughing uncontrollably again. They wuz all dressed up like they were going to a gay disco on Halloween night.”

“They managed to get my long guns as I wuz writhing in laughter. Then they told me to get to my feet cuz they wuz taking me back to thar lair as their prisoner. As they marched me toward their lair I wuz still cackling up a storm. This wuz the funniest situation that I been in since I accidentally blew up the Vietnam Special Olympics thinking it wuz sum kind of weird military exercise. 

“The Pukwudgie lair was underground. I had to get on my belly and crawl into a cave. Then I had to stay on my belly and crawl downward a bit.  We came to an oppening with a fire burning on the floor. At least in this larger chamber I could stand up, even though I had to stay bent over.”

“Of course, I could have gotten free and slaughtered those little pricks at any time. But my task wuz to find old Big Cock. So I let them take me prisoner. It wuz pretty easy to, cuz I plum went into hysterics when I got a look at these little dwarf things and their very gay clothes and heard their cartoony sounding voices.”

“Then I spied a big pot hanging over the fire. They wuz cooking a stew of some sort, and it smelled all gamey and gross. I took their spoon and started stirring it, which really pissed off the critters. This one started kicking my ankle with the pointing-end of his costume looking shoe. I kicked that sumbitch and it landed against the wall. That got them rip-roaring mad. Jest then I got the fright of my life. As I stirred the gross looking stew, a human head floated up in the pot. IT WUZ BIG COCK’s HEADS!! Then I noticed Big Cock’s large wang floating in the pot.”

“Poor old Big Cock! He did not deserve to die like this... Murdered and eaten by maniacal muppets. The critters surrounded me and told me to get away from the cooking pot. I sed ‘You little fuck-tards kilt my friend. Now you is gonna have to pay. So I reached into my ass and pulled out my .480 revolver. The Pukwudgies stepped back at the sight of my large weapon. Then all hell broke loose. ‘BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!!!!’ I dropped all 5 of those motherfuckers, right thar in the lair. These little twats have been known to work sum black magic fuckery, so I took my Ka-Bar and cut the heads off all five of them.”

“I found me an old burlap bag then fished Big Cock’s remains out of the stew and put ‘em in the bag. There wuz the head, both hands, and his hawg. I tied up the bag. Right before I left I thought ‘what the fuck?’, and spooned out sum 
of that stew and tasted it. Surprisingly, it weren’t bad. I found me an old styrofoam container one of these lil rascals must have found and brought home. I used it to hold some that stew I thought I would bring home fer dinner. So with the bag carrying Big Cock’s remains, and my take-out stew, I crawled outa thar.”

“I went back to my cabin first so I could put my stew on ice fer later. Then I departed. I had to be the bearer of bad news to Mrs. Miller. It wuz about 1:30 am, I reckon, when I knocked on her door. Mrs Miller opened the door in her night robe. Brutha, the front of that robe showed off them titties right fine! I could even make out the nipples through the fabric. I sed, ‘Honey, I dun found yer man. Then I set that burlap bag on her floor. I handed her BC’s dog tags. Then I pointed to the bag of body parts and sed ‘What’s left of him is in here. You want to take a look, or you wanna jest save it fer a proper funeral?’ 

“At this here point, Mrs. Miller broke down cryin. About that time I heard old Sheriff call out ‘Honey? You coming back to bed?’ Then that fat, sloppy sumbitch came walking down the stairs wearing nothing but his drawers and patrol hat. He saw me and sed ‘Oh, hi, Roy.’”

“I wuz speechless. I sed, ‘What the fuck is you doing? You fucking BC’s bitch?’ He stammered about and sed ‘Well, Roy, she is hurtin and I jest tried to comfort her, then one thang led to another.’ “

“Mrs. Miller had then composed herself and walked over. She apologized for falling apart like that. The she hugged me, saying thank you for finding out what happened to John and for bringing his remains home so she can have a service and grieve properly. I told her I wuz sorry fer her loss.”

“Then I sed, ‘You know what you need, Mrs. Miller?’ She looked puzzled. I sed ‘You need a good fucking slapped on yer ass. That fat-fuck Sheriff couldn’t make a dog come to dinner. Why don’t ya let old Roy, The “Pope of Joy”, take you upstairs and DESTROY your pussy? We’ll make Sheriff just sit there and watch, like in a cuck video.”

“So the three of us went upstairs. I tied up Sheriff to a chair and he had to sit there and watch me bang his new girlfriend the rest of the night! He even cried a little. Ha ha ha ha!!!!”

“The next morning I woke up lying next to Old Mrs. Miller. Sheriff wuz still tied up at bedside, but he wuz sleeping. His head wuz down and he wuz snoring. I wuz still a bit shook up by Big Cock’s death. Mrs. Miller wuz sleeping soundly, which wuz to be expected after I put a pounding on that pussy.”

“I sed out loud, ‘Old Big Cock, wharever you is right now, I hope ya know I is sorry fer how this turned out, buddy. But, as tribute to you and all the fun we used to have back in Nam, please accept this gesture as a token of our friendship.’ Then I reached fer my Ruger .480.”

“At the sound of the report from the pistol, Old Sheriff, still tied up, fell over in the chair, landing hard on the floor with a THUD. I then sed ‘Well, Mrs. Miller, you fucked me good. So now I returned the favor. Now you are FUCKED!’ Indeed, her brains were splattered all over the wall.”

“I untied old Sheriff and told him that he wuz going to have the distinct pleasure and privilege of buying me breakfast at the Waffle House this morning. He asked why I executed Mrs. Miller. I sed I wuz jest settin Big Cock free.”

About a year ago my husband (30 M) and I (28 F) found out I was pregnant. My dad owned an empty house and also ran his business out in the huge barn in the back of the property. He offered us to live in the home pay him $2000 a month and at the end of one year that would be considered our down payment to purchase the home. He said we would pay the utilities and half of trash that we used because my parents also use the dumpster that’s there for their trash. He would also leave his business within a month and “be out of our hair”. We agreed and moved in. The lady that had lived there before had over 30 cats my dad told us. We ended up cleaning that entire house my husband and I. It was extremely bad cat poop everywhere and had sat like that for a year. We bought new flooring and repainted the whole house. After we had moved in my dad then added a $300 insurance bill we had to pay. That covered our house, garage and his business which we did not have access to even though it was considered “ours”. He told us that he would be out of there within a month and ended up staying the entire time we lived there. And told us we had to pay property taxes $600 each quarter. So we did. I ended up losing my job and was put on bed rest for the rest of my pregnancy which at the time I was 6 months pregnant. My husband made good money but didn’t make enough to pay all of that by himself. So we talked my dad into lowering the cost to $1000 a month for the house in which he agreed. This would also extend the time for us to get a loan as well. We agreed 3 years. My dad then changed the agreement and wanted us to give him $1000 for rent and then give him $1000 to hold for us for a down payment. Which was once again $2000. At one point he offered us a “brand new mower” said it would be $250 if we wanted it. My husband paid that and then my dad said it would need to be fixed and he would fix it. He then charged my husband $650 after the $250 we had paid and then it wasn’t even fixed and we couldn’t use the mower anyways. My dad also parked his customers cars all over the property up to our house the entire year and a half we were there to where we would have to make 5-point turns to get into our driveway. I kindly asked him if he could keep them out of our driveway and he said he didn’t have room. That he has to make money. There was an entire acre of land. And regardless he technically shut that business down with the city a year ago. He’s working under the table. My dad constantly brags about the things he buys. He bought a $50,000 custom side by side and a $90,000 truck. He also had a key to our house and would randomly walk in all the time without even calling or knocking. I have woken up many times in the morning to find him sitting in our living room. Watching TV and drinking coffee. And to be clear even though he is well well off I never expected him or asked him for help to pay our bills. Not once not ever. (this is important to the story). I only asked to lower off the cost of the house because I could not work. Around august of this year I found out that I was pregnant again and I’m incredibly sick and have HG and watch our daughter while my husband works 14 hours a day. The company my husband works for was in a huge lawsuit at this time and they cut everyone’s hours. To then he explained to my dad when things pick back up (which they did in about a month) he would pay him back for this current month. My dad agreed. And then about a week later changed his mind and told us we had to leave. We took out a small loan that we could get and rented a house. Moved everything out except a couple of house plants, one box and curtains. We had left a bag of paper trash. An empty box and an empty Pepsi box in the kitchen. That was it. I had told my dad we would be back to get the rest at some point. After a week of living in our new home I had called my dad and explained again we needed to get the rest of our things. And that we would be there whenever my husband had a day off ( he works 6 days a week) to get the rest of the stuff and sweep the house. He said okay and I left it alone. The next day I get a nasty text from my mom saying that we trashed the house and we need to come there to clean it immediately that we shouldn’t leave the house like that. I was livid. When I tell you that’s all we left in the house, that was it, I took pictures of it before we cleaned and after. And the house was spotless other than the few things we left. It took 15 mins to sweep and throw away a bag and two boxes and grab the rest of our things. The house is now empty, spotless, and clean. My husband and I were both extremely upset to have to move. But we thought it would be better anyways. They also told me before all of this they wouldn’t be here for thanksgiving which is a normal thing. And then I got a text today being invited to their thanksgiving. Is it wrong of me to not go? Am I overreacting? I just think how he did me was wrong. This is not the first time my dad has done me this way either. And my mom is extremely narcissistic. I just want to cut complete contact. AITAH for that?",1,1732673110.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

# Introduction:

The relentless pursuit of a healthy weight loss journey is a common thread that binds many. Countless diets and exercise programs flood the market, each promising the key to unlocking your dream physique. While some methods deliver impressive results, others leave us feeling discouraged. But what if your morning cup of coffee could become an unexpected ally in your weight loss battle?

But does the reality live up to the hype? Let's dive deep into a comprehensive Java Burn review to uncover its potential benefits, scientific backing, and potential drawbacks.

# Unveiling Java Burn: A Closer Look

Java Burn is a dietary supplement designed to enhance your weight loss efforts. Packaged in convenient single-serving packets, it's intended to be mixed with your morning coffee. The manufacturer positions Java Burn as a natural formula that utilizes a blend of plant-based ingredients scientifically chosen to target key metabolic processes.  

[Get Started With Java Burn Today!](https://freepage.pro/mugash4/java-burn)

# The Science Behind Java Burn: Does it Hold Weight?

While the complete formula is proprietary, the manufacturer highlights several key ingredients with potential metabolic benefits:

· **Green Tea Extract:** Green tea boasts a robust reputation for its weight loss properties. Studies have shown it can increase thermogenesis, the body's natural process of burning calories to generate heat.  

· **Chromium:** This essential mineral plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels, which can indirectly impact weight management.  

· **L-Carnitine:** This amino acid assists in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria, the cell's powerhouse, where they are burned for energy.  

· **Green Coffee Bean Extract:** Unroasted coffee beans contain chlorogenic acid, a compound linked to improved blood sugar control and potentially enhanced fat burning.  

**It's important to note that the research on these individual ingredients is ongoing, and their effectiveness in a combined formula like Java Burn requires further investigation**.

# A Spark of Hope: Potential Benefits of Java Burn

Java Burn promotes a range of potential benefits, including:

· **Enhanced Metabolism:** The blend of ingredients could potentially work synergistically to boost metabolism, leading to increased calorie burning throughout the day.  

· **Improved Energy Levels:** Ingredients like Green Tea Extract are known for their energy-enhancing properties, potentially leaving you feeling more vibrant throughout your day.  

· **Appetite Suppression:** Java Burn could potentially help curb cravings and promote feelings of satiety, making it easier to stick to a healthy calorie deficit.  

· **Faster Fat Burning:** The combined effects of the formula could potentially accelerate the body's process of burning stored fat for energy.

**Remember, these are potential benefits, and individual results may vary**. A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, forms the foundation for successful weight loss. Java Burn should be viewed as a potential supplement, not a magic bullet.  

# Navigating the Waters: Potential Drawbacks of Java Burn

While Java Burn paints an optimistic picture, there are some potential drawbacks to consider:

· **Limited Scientific Evidence:** While the individual ingredients have shown promise, comprehensive studies on the efficacy of the exact Java Burn formula are scarce.

· **Individual Variability:** What works wonders for one person might not have a noticeable impact on another. Factors like genetics and overall health can influence results.

· **Cost Factor:** A single pouch of Java Burn can be pricey, and depending on the package you choose, the cost can add up over time.  

· **Potential Side Effects:** As with any dietary supplement, there's a chance of experiencing mild side effects, such as stomach upset or jitters. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions, consult your doctor before incorporating Java Burn into your routine.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Unraveling the Mysteries

**1. Is Java Burn Safe?**

The manufacturer claims the ingredients are all-natural and generally safe for consumption by most healthy adults. However, it's crucial to consult with your doctor before using Java Burn, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking medications.  

**2. How Long Does it Take to See Results with Java Burn?**

Individual results will vary. The manufacturer suggests allowing 2-3 months to experience the full benefits, emphasizing consistency in daily use.

**3. Is Java Burn a Standalone Solution for Weight Loss?**

Java Burn is a supplement, not a replacement for a healthy lifestyle. For optimal results, combine it with a balanced diet and regular exercise.

**4. Can I Use Java Burn with Other Supplements?**

It's generally advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before combining Java Burn with other supplements, especially those that affect metabolism or energy levels.

**5. Is Java Burn Suitable for Vegetarians and Vegans?**

The manufacturer claims that Java Burn is suitable for vegetarians and vegans. However, it's always recommended to check the specific ingredients list to ensure it aligns with your dietary preferences.

# Weighing the Evidence: Is Java Burn Worth a Try?

The decision to incorporate Java Burn into your weight loss journey is a personal one. While the potential benefits are enticing, it's essential to approach it with realistic expectations. If you're looking for a natural way to boost your metabolism and support your weight loss goals, Java Burn could be worth considering. However, it's crucial to remember that there's no magic pill for weight loss. A comprehensive approach that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep remains the cornerstone of sustainable weight management.

# Conclusion:

Java Burn presents itself as an intriguing option for those seeking a natural boost to their weight loss efforts. The blend of ingredients holds potential for enhancing metabolism and energy levels. However, it's crucial to approach it with realistic expectations and consult with a healthcare professional before making a decision. Remember, the key to successful weight loss lies in a holistic approach that combines healthy habits, patience, and a positive mindset.

Can't really say I hate her but I do feel really hurt.

For some reason, I have been using humour to cope with this rejection a lot. Either that or just helping friends in any way possible hoping it helps me feel better.

I had two conversations last week about what happened with my crush or I should say former crush at this point. 

**Convo 1**

3 of us were hanging out for a late night snack post socials. One of them was my first female friend who knew about my crush since I shared her number to her since she lives in the area she reloacted to and her boyfriend hosts socials there. The other two were her boyfriend and a mutual friend in his mid 30s.

The mutual friend was talking about his dating struggles as we ate and when he was done, I jokingly told my female friend that I struck out for the 7th time this year.

She asked me what happened and I told her the story. I told her how upsetting I found the situation considering she said yes and even invited me once before doing this. 

In a later part of the conversation she told me that it is far easier for women to get dates giving herself as an example. She said that even she can as a below average looking woman (sells herself short in my opinion). Her boyfriend and the other friend also reinforced this statement and said that it is pretty much one sided in the early phases of dating since women have a ton of options.

It was slightly emotionally triggering for me and I said that I do not want to entertain women who treat men as expendable. It was the very reason I quit dating apps since that is the general treatment of men there in my experience and I saw this only after being reprimanded by a woman from this sub. 

One sided effort pretty much sounds like grovelling/begging in my books and I refuse to do it ever again. I hated doing it on dating apps and find it myself feeling very ashamed of myself for doing so. 

On the other hand, this dynamic sounds like a definite recipie to a very toxic relationship.

She then told me that I am in the wrong city unfortunately and I told her it is a similar story in the other cities I have tried dating in. 

In my opinion one could write off the entire human race if they looked for the negative. 

I realised that my voice was getting louder and I was angry afterall. I wasn't lashing out but I could feel this mix of sadness and anger in me. I apologised to them for raising my voice and tried to cool off.

My female friend then told me that I still deserve credit for trying so many times considering there used to be a time she eas the only woman I openly spoke to. She is happy that I have been making more friends over the years and about my growth in confidence and dance. 

**Convo 2**

I spoke to my close friend eho helped me with my crusb so far about the previous conversation. She was very compassionate about it thankfully. 

I told her that I have been on edge even though I am somewhat over her. I have been struggling with trying to understand why people do this. Why say yes when you cannot commit to it and why don't they even properly communicate they are not in the headspace to do so. Why do the very thing you complain of being done to you?

In this case, she suggested that yes, we can get coffee while I was playfully implying that is no longer a possibility as she said that she  was moving out. So this was clearly not a case of saying yes out of pressure, since I was already politely accepting a potential no based on her response.

My friend said that there is some amount of truth about the conversation I talked about. She admitted that she herself is guilty of stringing along many guys in college in the past (I find noteworthy that I was not mad at her for some reason).

She then told me that me being so thoughtful, kind and socially aware at my current level makes me a very small minority as a person regardless of gender. 

Also the people who are not really showing that much committment even on this level are not exactly happy either. Not denying it, people do have mental health issues and toxic beliefs that go unaddressed.

Both of the above comversations have had me thinking on how I should even approach dating now. 

There is truth here to an extent. It is easier for women to get dates. It is because a huge majority men here are really desperate. I have seen it firsthand a couple of times and my colleague once told me about an incident where he refused an advance which surprised the woman who said she assumed this stereotype. It is not necesarrily a good thing either as I have learnt during my time on the sub.

For me, I don't think I am as desperate to get laid anymore. I want a genuine connection, someone I feel secure with knowing that she does not see me as someone she can easily replace. 

A lot of people have told me that I have to play this ""game"". I refuse to play it. I would rather say ""take it or leave it"".

I don't want to beg for someone for liking me back, for even going out on a date taking multiple follow ups. 

People date even when there are obstacles in the way in life if they like someone. My friend is a living proof of it. She is a divorcee and a domestic abuse victim. She was the one who asked out her boyfriend and was willing to trust him. They are both good friends of mine, her boyfriend knows very well that I see her as an elder sister.

Which is what leads to the question I ask now -

How much effort/enthusiasm should I expect from a woman who says yes to a date?

I expect the following -

>Does not treat me like an option. Not sure how I would know this but it matters a lot to me.

>Gives a proper day and time, place if she wants to, completely fine by me.

>Confirms if we are still on for the date the day before/the day of the date.

>Has some amount of excitement at least cause hey, there has to be some amount of romantic interest in a person you said yes to right?

>If the date is called off for genuine reasons on her end, she communicates and suggests another time eventually.

I feel like an absence of any of the above should make me cautious at the very least if not consider it a red flag.

Not sure if this is the right way so I ask, is this the right way to go?

Am I being too harsh?

When I was younger, my “comfort zone” was practically the size of a football field. I’d try new things without even thinking twice—go to unfamiliar places, meet random people, sign up for hobbies I knew nothing about. But lately, I’ve noticed that my comfort zone has been slowly shrinking.

At this point, it’s basically the size of my couch and a very specific spot in the coffee shop I visit every morning. I’ll venture into the kitchen to make lunch, but only if it’s the same sandwich I’ve made for the past 10 years. I’ll leave my house, but only if I can predict exactly what’s going to happen.

Is this just a natural progression of aging, or am I slowly becoming a hermit with an extensive collection of ""favorite mugs""? What happened to the fearless, spontaneous person I used to be? Should I be worried? Or is this just a healthy embrace of finding peace in predictability?

1h0t43n,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1h0t43n/did_my_brother_make_a_huge_mistake_euthanizing/,Did my brother make a huge mistake euthanizing his dog?,"My brother had a pitbull mix that was 10 years old (until last week). I used to live with my brother so I was very close with the dog, Rory. In the 8 years of owning him, the dog was a good boy 99% of the time. We suspect that the first owners mistreated him, and the resulting trauma caused what I'm about to describe. Rory has bitten multiple peoples' hands, five or six times in total over the last 6 years. One of those times was me, but it was a moment of chaos and a misunderstanding so I fully forgave him immediately. Most of the times he has bitten hands he has drawn blood, and it's almost always as a result of someone approaching him and starting to touch him to move him out of the way. For example, two or three years ago he bit my uncle's hand as he was trying to move him to the other side of the couch. Rory was such a lovable dog though that most of the people who he has bitten didn't really hold it against him, as we understood he had trauma and they were just snap reactions to people touching him.

Knowing that Rory had bitten and drawn blood has slowly changed everyone's behavior around him. He was rarely introduced to new people, had to be put in a bedroom when guests came over, and sometimes (at least once a day) he would get this ""sketchy"" vibe to him where we were all afraid to approach him and actively avoided petting him. The general rule was to let him come to you, which he often would for pets. I just want to emphasize that he was such a sweet and cuddly dog 90% of the day. When I dogsat he would sleep in the bed with me, for example. But when he was in the bed with me I always had a little fear inside me that he would bite my throat in my sleep if I accidentally touched him (though his biting history was always just hands).

BACK TO NOW: last week my brother and his wife were sitting on the couch drinking coffee and their toddler was playing on the ground. The toddler started to climb the couch where Rory was sitting, and my brother (stupidly) reached over and grabbed Rory's paw to move it to the side so that the toddler wouldn't grab the dog. Rory lost his mind and attacked my brother's hand. He grabbed on and wouldn't let go. His wife had to pull the dog off of him. There was blood all over the couch, the baby was screaming - it was a horrible moment. They put the dog outside where he stayed alone for like an hour then he came back inside and was distant. They were shaken up and panicking. They made an extremely rushed decision and took him to the vet to put him down the next day. They didn't know anyone who could take him and they didn't want the dog to feel like they abandoned him, they didn't want him sitting sad in a shelter, and they didn't want to live their lives constantly having to lock him away and keep him separated from the baby. They were suddenly super worried about the toddler. A lot of ""if he ever bites the toddler I will never forgive myself."" I felt deep down that it was the wrong decision to make, and I fear my sister in law is regretting doing it now. He was a very sweet and unique dog. An old soul. I loved him. I couldn't take him because I live on the other side of the planet now in a different country. Based on what my sister in law has texted me (she is really in a terrible state of grief right now) I'm getting the vibe that she feels like they shouldn't have rushed to put him down. I told them to wait to make the decision and to really think it over and I suggested alternatives but they had their mind made up and wanted to get it over with. It seemed like they just wanted the agony of making a decision to end.

Do you guys think it was the right decision to make? Did they make a huge mistake not trying medication, extra training, etc. before putting him down? I am so filled with regret that I didn't fight harder to convince them to send him to a specialized trainer or something.

Around friends he is one person. Around parents he is someone else. When he is alone, he is yet another version entirely. This also applies to our habits, both good and bad.

Think about it. Have you ever been drinking, and suddenly that version of you insists on having a cigarette? Or maybe in the morning your willpower is rock-solid, and you confidently pass on the sweet treat at the coffee shop. By nightfall, though, another version of you takes over, raiding the pantry and devouring every sweet in sight.

The key to staying in control is learning to recognize who is in charge and who is causing the chaos. For me, it’s nighttime me. That guy tries to sabotage all my progress. He craves sweets, wants to stay up late, melt into the couch, skip showers, and do nothing productive. If I let him run the show, he would ruin every ounce of effort I put in during the day.  
Attempt to make the version of you that wants the best for you the man behind the wheel. The version that believes in your goals, and does the hard work. Indentify and choose the right decisions, you can consciously choose to be weak or to be strong. Genuinely, the next time you are in a scenario ask yourself self weakness or strength, then act accordingly. It doesn't really fit in here but I'm gonna say it now so I don't forget, same applies with being with a woman, am I going to respond confidently or like an insecure little weenie boy. Choose confidence, anyway.

When the little destructive goblin inside you pops out it’s important to spot this version of yourself and, with a firm stance, tell him, “You’re not in charge, and you need to step aside.”

Throughout the day, ask yourself who is in control right now. Is it the gangster, badass, goal-crushing version of me? Or is it the lazy, self-sabotaging version who wants to rot on the couch?

Stay vigilant. Recognize the enemy. Take control. Defeat him.

About 8 years ago I dated a guy who I was very much in love with. We dated for about a year, but I made a mistake that I'm not sure he ever fully got over..and I don't blame him. He broke up with me and said he wanted to explore more in his life. We didn't talk after that, he began dating another girl and I began dating my now husband. We had been together about a year when I started having consistent dreams about my ex. I tried to brush them off, but then one evening I was at a Bible study that a friend was hosting and another girl began talking about how she'd been dreaming about someone and she felt compelled to reach out to them and was glad she did. The way she worded it just couldn't have been more descriptive of what I'd been thinking/feeling, so I decided to reach out to my ex. I sent a simple message, explaining that I knew it was out of nowhere, and understood if he didn't feel comfortable responding... but he did. We messaged back and forth, and even talked on the phone a couple times. I was very forthcoming with my current bf/husband and told him that we were talking to each other, and he was uneasy but understanding. I eventually explained to my ex my reasoning for reaching out initially, and to both of our surprise, he had been having consistent dreams as well. We continued to talk for about another week, and then just kind of stopped. I didn't want to get to a point of anything romantic out of respect for my bf/husband, so we really couldn't talk about anything more than day to day things. Another year goes by, and almost to the date, I get a text from my ex asking if I'd like to meet for coffee. Again, I'd been having dreams and so I say yes. I go and meet him that day and we talk about why we keep on having these dreams and compelling feelings towards one another. He asks me what I think and I honestly don't know what to say because I don't want to throw away my current relationship on a ""what if"", but I also know that I love(d) this man so incredibly much. We talk for a little while, then I have to leave. He walked me to my car and asked if he could give me a hug, to which I agreed, and I can honestly say I've thought more than one time since then about how I wished I could relive that moment. After that we text for a day or two more, then again things left off. About  a year later he had another girlfriend, and after another year, a fiancee. During that time I got engaged and married, as well as had a child. It's been 8 years and still I think about him, occasionally dream about him, and constantly wonder if I ignored blatantly obvious signs. I know it doesn't help that my husband and I have been struggling for over a year, and lately his temper is worse and his morals have proven to be more flexible than I'm comfortable with, but even before all this when my husband and I were great, I still thought about my ex. I know there's really not much I can do now that we have a child together, and I'm not at all fond of the thought of our child coming up in a split home. I guess I'm just here for opinions and to finally get this off my chest and talk about it to other people. Thanks for reading this far.",1,1732671179.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Then put some ice in the drink (the colder, the better). Finally, add a spoon or two of oil. (Rather olive oil, canola oil, coconut oil, ect...). Continue stirring and have a spoon while drinking it, as this will prevent the oil from settling at the top. You can add this to stuff like coffee, tea, or even hot chocolate.

1h0snyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h0snyx/aitah_for_freaking_out_at_my_husband_details_in/,AITAH for freaking out at my husband? Details in post ,"I'll try to keep this short but will likely fail. 

My husband and I have a 3 year old daughter. Her school is off this week. My husband is working and works remote. I am in the process of starting a business, but we're not open just yet, so have more time at the moment. We agreed I'd watch my daughter Mon - Wed of thanksgiving week where she's normally in school from 8 - 3:30. 

  
This morning, My daughter and I were headed to the library, Costco, and to get an allergy shot for me. My husband was walking the neighborhood, making a call. Since we were leaving soon, and laundry was running, I texted: 

""If you could switch the towels to the dryer at 9:15 I'd really appreciate it, then I can fold them and put them away."" 

I was planning to fold the towels during naptime.



My daughter has been regressing and acting out a little lately, normal 3 yr old stuff, and one of the less than desirable behaviors is pouring water bottles out, and pouring ice and water out of the refrigerator, which makes a big mess. That's why we were washing the towels. At this exact moment, I was trying to get everything ready for our errands and stopping her from pouring more water everywhere. I was also cleaning, tidying, running the dishwasher, etc. We have a lot to do to get ready for travel out of town. I walked by the clothes washer and saw the amount of minutes left on the washer, and realized I made a typo / math error, and texted again, 

""I meant 9:50 so just quick when you're back."" 

  
He said ""I can't do it at 950. I have meetings 930 - 11"" 

I texted ""Ok I just mean this - Switch it when you can. Ok? I mean that I'll be gone, please switch it when you can"" 

A few minutes later he walked in, and I then confronted him in person, as he was walking around the house for a few minutes, aka not in meetings / on calls, saying ""Hey when I ask you to do something would you please just do it instead of trying to find a reason not to?"" I was flustered from so many things happening at once and trying to stop our daughter from pouring water / making messes. 

He got mad and stormed off. The reason I am upset is that this is a very tired pattern in our marriage. If he asks me to do something, I either say yes, or yes I can do it at this time. During this exact period, our daughter was acting out, and I was doing a million things including cleaning, tidying, I had just made pancakes for our daughter, ran the dishwasher, she was spilling more water, and we were trying to get ready to go. I had also realized there were MORE water bottles around that I hadn't realized were out, that my daughter was now pouring out, so more messes to clean. In the texts, I had really meant to convey ""please switch the laundry \*anytime after\* \_\_\_\_ time. My husband took me sharing a specific time the load ended as a reason to not switch the laundry, which takes 30 seconds tops. He usually has around 5 minutes between meetings at least every hour, and frequently walks to the kitchen where the laundry is for food and water obviously. 

After storming off, he texted a screenshot of my 1st text when I wrote 9:15 by mistake. 

I texted back: ""I fucking mean it's done at this time, Can you switch it after"" 

He texted ""Then write that or clarify. Don't blow up when I read your text for what you say. I didn't deserve that in front of my daughter. Leave me alone and i'll be on my own for dinner.""  

I texted ""You're a child. Leave me alone til tomorrow. You ask me to do things and I say yes. I ask you and you say I can't this second, I can't at this time. I am running errands for us and watching our kid and folding the laundry and I'm asking - It's done at this time, can you switch it?"" 

I texted ""It's so easy to just say I'll be in meetings but I can switch it when I can. You have a shitty attitude and you can't handle criticism. This is the root of 90% of our problems. I'm done with you for today. And it makes me feel taken fro granted cause I do everything you ask me to do. I say, I'll do it at this time or on this day. You constantly are entitled to me doing that but when I ask you to do a 30 second task you protest and try to get out of it."" 

I texted ""I'm exhausted from you."" 

  
We continued fighting for the whole day, but again, this is a part of a long pattern. When I ask him to do things, he tries to get out of the tasks, or has an attitude. He also constantly misconstrues what I say, and he replies saying ""I can't right now,"" when the things I'm asking him are clearly not requests I'm asking him to do this exact second. It's an obvious excuse, and an obvious way to try to get out of the task period. The argument is essentially, ""well I can't this second, so no, I won't do it at all."" Again, on my end, I'll just say to his requests of me ""yes, I'll do it at this time,"" or ""Yes, I can do it this day,"" etc. 

I am beyond frustrated, and he simply keeps doubling down that I'm mad when it was my typo over text. Again, our daughter was acting out, had poured so much water everywhere, and I was 

  
tidying, putting stuff away

making coffee for tomorrow morning 

running the dishwasher after loading it 

cleaning the kitchen counters 

cleaning the water our kid spilled 

washing the towels from the spilled water 

taking the trash out 

taking the recycling out 

getting ready to go to the library, allergy shot place, and costco.

I was also watching our daughter during dinner time today, making dinner, cleaning up dinner, and giving her a bath and doing bedtime today. We normally both work and split tasks, this week she's just off and my husband had plans tonight after work. 

  
We texted more, but one of my texts was ""I asked you to switch the fucking laundry and was texting as fast as I could while she was pouring more water. You say no. I ask you AGAIN. You say no AGAIN."" 



I'm still fucking pissed. We aren't talking right now. My husband is doubling down that I made a typo and it's not his fault. I am frustrated with asking for a simple favor, being a team, etc, and he tries to find ways out of simple tasks. 



AITAH reddit? I'm simply looking for him to say ""sure, I'll do it when I can."" That's the whole issue.

So I have been wondering for a while what to do from giving up to ignoring her  to bettering myself in any way to show her I am right for her but I’ve been depressed since she stopped our situationship, I was trying so hard to show her (K) I want her and only her that a relationship is what I want and I would be right and treat her right, I made mistakes and treated her bad at start with only wanted no strings but I was scared of a relationship so many get hurt and cheat and that’s my biggest fear so I told her let’s keep it fun and let talk about a relationship later when she said she is looking one I think now that she was asking me if I wanted but I’m an insecure ass so I said let’s talk about that later I think I hurt her with that but she never showed cause she never wants to upset people puts others first so it was hard to know when I did something wrong but I know I did. We dated for a while and I love every and all I spent with her, she smart, cool, funny, interesting, nice, brave and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known but I lost her I told her how I wanted to be with her and be so lucky to say she’s my girlfriend I never felt this way about someone but it was too late she kept pushing me and trying to distance herself so I lost interest until I asked her can we have a conversation she said she didn’t want a relationship she has too much on right now and didn’t want to put me through that, I didn’t care I said I’d support her through it because she’s worth it but she said she couldn’t saying she didn’t feel the same after one of the dates we had I think I know which one but not sure she never was direct with me which hurts not being able to communicate she would take hours to respond days to talk I know she was avoiding it but it’s disrespectful to do that what we had was good but she was able to switch off idk how which hurts, she said we could be friends and I agreed but told her that I’ll wait because there’s no one else like her and she worth it she told me she didn’t want me to and I said I don’t want to stress you I’m happy with being friends and waiting and if she meets someone else I’ll be sad but happy for her, I had unfollowed her because I was upset earlier in the conversation that took days to get replies so I told her and tried to follow she denied and I was hurt that we could be friends was an empty gesture we took some days away from chat I was depressed losing someone over my insecurities so went out with my friend to feel better we drank I denied being upset cause I don’t like to be open but alcohol does that I cried and told them how dumb I was and I went home but still drunk I decided to call one last effort to show I’m serious about my feelings her friend (A) picks up sayings she in the restroom so she can talk to her I know that was a lie she couldn’t even talk to me herself which hurts more but I talk and she tells me she met someone else and my heart just dropped but I told her I wish them the best and hung up. A is really nice she was sweet to me about it and I thank her for that wish her the best too but K couldn’t even talk to me herself just one conversation together she would even give me that so I’m depressed but at least I could try to get over her but she keeps showing up in my area and I know it’s for sex stab in my heart every time how do I know that it for sex? Cause she doesn’t work go to college or have any friends that live where I do and I saw her on hinge so I don’t she met someone that was just to get rid of me, I keep seeing her and it hurts every time why near my home my work why do I got to know she here and she fucking. I did a lot of shitty things but so has she not an excuse but I want to try and be better she kept sabotaging us by not bringing up issues and hiding how she felt and trying to ditch me on dates to push me away instead of talking to me like adults I’m angry and I’m hurt but I still want her, I don’t respect myself if I did go back to her now and she didn’t apologise for her behaviour but I think about every day all the good times all the moments I spent with her how she felt on me I wish I could fix it be the guy I should have been, this turned into a rant sounds like I hate her but I don’t just hurt about losing her when we could of worked. How can I move on I want to ask her for one last conversation get coffee to fix us or for closure.",1,1732670709.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

But, if you were to take a girl on a “date” do you expect something in return. I’m talking PG like a Kiss. So get your mind out the gutter. Anyways, I went on a date with a guy I had met online and he was nice but I didn’t feel interest in him romantically, so I told him and went meet once for coffee and talked and I tried to get him to date my friend but he was interested in me still. I strictly told him I wanted to only be friends. One night I was supposed to go out with my friends and they other plans but I really wanted to hang out bc I was in the mood and he invited me to go bowling with him, but the place was also a restaurant. So we ate first and then after he asked me over to his place to see his guitar (he sent me videos of him placing the guitar) so I thought nothing of it plus I know he had roommates so he weren’t going to be alone (not that stopped anyone before) but in this case it was not happening, so I go over he shows me his place and then after I started to get uncomfortable I told him I had to go (his place was a pig stand) and I was just getting the ick and nauseous, so I left and before I left he asked me if he could kiss me as I walked out, he had his tongue out and everything. I was like I told you I didn’t want anything more than friends, and I ran out went to my car and immediately blocked him. Never talk to guy again. Anywho, Why is it when you tell guys you want to be friends they still try to be more? Also, since he paid for my dinner which literally was just French fries I guess he thought I owed him something.

How do I bring him back down to earth? ","Hello, I posted this in relationship advice, but it was deleted and I was banned for the reason ""rage bait bot"". I am not a bot, I am genuinely needing help with communicating with my husband. Hoping for some actual advice instead of people telling me there's no way this is real. It is real and this my daily life. 

Some background:

I (36F) have been married to my husband (39M) for around 7 years. I met my husband while he was in the military, and I had up until the last two years made as much, or more money than him. I also did most of the cooking, cleaning and general home duties, as well as look after our three young kids (6 and under). Luckily with the money I was making, I was able to hire a weekly cleaner, as well as a nanny for a few hours a day to take care of the kids. The evening routine (dinner, bath, teeth, book and bed) has always been my job, no matter how busy I was with work, because my husband ""doesn't like doing it."" He has a short temper with the kids, so I generally am their default parent. 

We had some issues in our relationship a few years ago because I was so burnt out and overwhelmed with taking care of everyone, on top of a job where it's common to work evenings and weekends (real estate). I didn't get days off between work and the kids.

Fast forward to last year, my husband retired out of the military and got a high paying job. We decided I would stop working  and focus on our ""side"" incomes. We had a couple of rental properties and recently purchased a franchise, which unfortunately is yet to break ground. We agreed that I could do online school to get my MBA because it would benefit our new business. In addition, I would be the main caretaker for our kids and the home. I also am the sole caretaker of our dog and cats, and literally do everything around the house, including taking out the trash, changing lightbulbs etc. My husband is not handy, so anything I can't do myself I have to hire out. I also take care of all of our finances, pay our bills, handle our budgets, big purchases, investments, rentals etc. I also handle all of the kids sports, doctor appointments, school stuff etc. I wake up before my husband in the morning to make him his coffee and breakfast so it is ready for him. I also wake up early with the kids every weekend, letting him sleep in on Saturdays and Sundays. The trade off for this was supposed to be that I get a mid-day nap. I only occasionally get to take these naps, and if I do, it's followed by my husband immediately needing a break from the kids, so he will stay in our bedroom for the rest of the day. Occasionally he will do a weekend walk with the kids or some kind of outdoor activity, but it almost always means that I won't see him for the rest of the day so he can get his break. 

Now my husband has just been given an amazing job opportunity which will allow him to work remotely on top of a higher salary. He even mentioned to me that now he would be able to help a little more with some of the extra tasks I have piling on, like calling contractors for things he wants build at our house, and taking kids to their evening sports. 

The problem is that since I ""stopped working"", he literally doesn't lift a finger to help me with anything. He acts like because he makes so much money he shouldn't have to do anything else. He barely plays with our kids, he leaves piles of dirty clothes all over the house, leaves his dirty dishes sometimes in random places, doesn't do laundry, doesn't do dishes, doesn't cook, doesn't meal plan or get groceries, doesn't take the trash out, doesn't feed the animals, doesn't help pick up after the kids, doesn't help with dinner, bath, teeth and bed unless I specifically tell him I'm not feeling well and could he do one of those things. 

I feel like I'm constantly cleaning, or cooking, or hearing ""mommy mommy mommy"" and my husband just sits on the couch and plays on his phone. If I tell him I need him to help with the kids, he just yells at them.  

If he's feeling extra rested, he may get a random burst and play with the kids for 5 minutes before he disappears to the bathroom or our bedroom for the foreseeable future. 

Last night we got in a huge fight because he asked me to do the benefits enrollment for his new job. I said that he could do that during his working hours since it's a part of his job. I also said I didn't know how our benefits had changed in the last year since he had retired from the military and he needed to look into that before doing the enrollment for his new job. He gave me this absolutely disgusted look and said he couldn't believe I didn't know what benefits we had. I said I have struggled with getting answers from the new insurance company and that it's difficult to do with my constant to-do list that's 100 miles long, and kids being loud in the background. He gave me such a disgusted look, like I was a lazy POS for even suggesting he find out our benefits situation. 

I told him I didn't like how disrespectful he was being and that I have a hundred things on my plate as it is, and that he has plenty of time to do it himself. I listed all of the things above that I do daily, and he made the comment that if I was actually taking care of the house it would be a lot more organized than it is. (Our house can get a bit messy, we have three kids under 6, but I am constantly cleaning and picking up, and it is honestly 100x tidier than most of our friends houses with young kids.)

I don't feel like our house is bad at all, but he has some OCD behavior about everything needing to be in ""its place"" (but won't help at all with making this an actual reality. He will literally just step over toys, clothes or dishes that our kids have put in a random place.) He says the messiness affects his mood and stresses him out. 

His comment felt so disrespectful, but I'm not sure if I'm just tired and over reacting.

 I don't feel appreciated, I don't feel like what I'm doing is ever enough, I could bend over backwards and it's not enough for him. Whenever I try to discuss how I feel, he locks onto one thing I say that I've worded incorrectly, and hyper focuses on that and turning it against me rather than actually listen to how I'm feeling. 

Tonight it was ""sometimes I feel like you don't lift a finger around this house"" and he got super angry and said ""I don't lift a finger? Never? Don't lift a finger huh?"" And completely disregarded everything else I said. 

He then used it as an opportunity to insult me because he put ""sometimes I feel like"" in front of it. ""Sometimes I feel like the house should be more organized since you're home all day.""

He does this every single time I try to express how much I need his help and how much I have on my plate, between the MBA program which is an accelerated program, running our investment properties, and having the kids and home to look after. Our oldest is in full time school but our younger two are only in school for 2-3 hours a day, and with drive-time that leaves me very little time to get things done in peace. 

He constantly, casually brings up more stuff I should do since I ""don't work"". Like we bought a chicken coop and he wants me to take care of chickens, and he wants a livestock guardian puppy, so both of those will be extra things that I will have to take care of. He wants me to grow a garden (something I would like as well) but he puts that solely on me, not something we can do together, he wants me to take a sourdough baking class when I just learned how to make regular bread (and was super proud of myself) and he just dismissed my accomplishment. Like he just has all of these extra things that he feels I should be doing on top of this expectation of a perfect house.

The crazy thing to me is that he has been alone with the kids for a week this past summer. He didn't do any laundry, only got take out, didn't do any cleaning, and the kids all went to a full day summer camp... so he still had it easy, and yet seems to think I am not doing enough. 

How do I communicate to this man that I am not his work horse, and that I need to be able to communicate that I am overwhelmed without having it blow up in my face as a huge fight? Help please. ",3,1732670572.0,okstorytime,3,1.0,False

It's like I felt a big connection out of nowhere

Last week was very bussy for us so we decided to meet this week, yesterday was the date and it was great we went for a coffee and after that for dinner and it was amazing! We talked and flirted even more than in audios, it was great just to crack jokes, know more about her and have fun, we started at 5 PM and ended the date at 3 AM sharing a lot of things about our lifes, we made plans to meet again on Saturday and she keep saying good things to me like she liked my voice, my personality or that if so much time pass so quickly that must mean something good, time truly passed in an instant. At the end I wanted to kiss her but I didn't knew if she would be up for a kiss in the first date or if she would feel uncomfortable, she just laugh and said ""Are you going to kiss me or what?"" and it was magical, we kissed two more times while laughing and went our separates ways.

Today she sent me a text saying that she enjoyed it but didn't feel the spark and we could remain as friends, I feel destroyed because I was starting to catch feelings, I responded saying that I couldn't see her as just a friend and wish her good luck, it's so weird because I don't tend to expose myself so much when I'm just meeting someone but she was so open, showed so much interest and was so caring that I let my guard down, it's strange to know so many things about someone and just never talk with them again. On her situation she ended a relationship a few months ago, so maybe it was too much too soon or maybe the chemistry was only from my part, but I keep thinking about all the effort she was putting on messages, the long time we spent together on the date and that last kiss, I'm so confused.",5,1732670459.0,dating,4,0.86,False

I picked up a mocca master, and the coffee is comparatively thin, flat , and watery. Two blind tastings by two people  yielded consistent results : the Oxo produced notably more robust coffee.

While I cannot see inside the Oxo while it brews, I suspect it does a better job dispersing water over the grounds. My next experiment is going to be to reduce the grind size to slow down water flow. 

I don't consider stirring to be a valid approach, as the whole point to an automated coffee maker is to remove work from the equation. 

Aside from the coffee, the moccamaster plastics and overall construction feels cheaper than the Oxo despite having a 50% price mark up. 

I will give the moccamaster carafe ( I have the KBT), a huge thumbs up. It's way better than the Oxo at keeping the coffee hot.

1h0sb7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1h0sb7i/prepping_basics/,Prepping Basics,"I know we have a mix of seasoned preppers, covid pantry stockers and complete new folks, so here's a basic guide.

But first a few rules to prepping:

1. Take a deep breath.  Panic will only net you 20 years of toilet paper or something similarly useless.

2. Don't spend money you don't have. If you run across a fantastic deal, that's a one off. Don't cripple your options by going into debt.

3. DON'T TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE PREPPING.  If you do that you may as well plant a sign on your lawn saying ""free groceries for home invaders"" if things get bad. I see a lot of ""my friends/family say I'm crazy..."" don't tell them.

Now some ideas:

1. Unless you're rich, you aren't prepping to survive for a decade. Start small with a BOB (bug out bag) and stay at home 3 day or 2 week kit

2. Build slowly.  I know we're looking at about 7-8 weeks until Jan 20th but even buying 2 packages of something when you need 1 will get you to a month or more of supplies by then

3. Plan.  What do you need? What will you actually eat? Every household is different.  Buy for your household - the best lists are generic  like this per person/month guide

Grains 25 lbs - Pulses 5 lbs - Salt 1 lb - Sweeteners 5 lbs - Fats/Oils 1 quart - Canned Vegetables 15 tins - Canned Fruits 12 tins -  Dried Potatoes 3 boxes of 2 bags - Water 60 gallons + extras: bouillon cubes, spices, tea/coffee & yeast

The salt is higher than you'll actually use in food because it's so useful for fermentation/pickling and other food preservation (and salt gargle for mouth/throat issues)

4. Separate wants from needs.  A fire extinguisher is a must (don't have one? Put it at the top of the list today) but unless you WFH and pay for your own equipment an extra laptop battery is a want.  Prepping isn't an excuse to run amok and hoard 10 of everything

Hopefully this helps someone. 

Stay safe and sane out there!

1h0sb6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/1h0sb6w/covid_progression_2024/,COVID Progression 2024,"Just took my second negative test in 48 hours so figured I'd share my symptom progression and some other things I think influenced my recovery. As of today I feel completely normal. A little more anxious than usual I'd say - which actually happened the other two times I got COVID too. Wonder if there's any research on that!

0 - sore throat, mild congestion, low energy 
- Went to work this day thinking I was developing a cold (I’m in a school so we get sick every other week). By the end of the day I had already taken the next day off. Took a test and it was negative. 

1 - more congestion, improvement in throat pain, very low energy
- home sick and was mostly just exhausted. Took a lot of things to help soothe the symptoms (Vicks, cough drops, robitussin, decongestant) and it did the trick. Also focused a lot on hydration and rest. Took 6 tests as one was positive with the faintest line in the morning and the following two were negative. Then the same pattern st night, except the positive test was more clear so I was confident I had it. 

2 - energy returning to standard, runny nose, near no sore throat, intermittent coughing (esp after movement/laying down)
- returned to work masked up and isolated in my office (meetings were virtual no interactions with coworkers, I have my own private office). Test VERY positive

3 - no sore throat, energy normal, runny nose/congestion, more coughing (due to post nasal drip)
- same deal. Another very dark line on the test

4 - congestion, productive cough
- rinse and repeat. Nose was like a faucet this day - must have gone through a whole box of tissues.

5 - congestion
- again - same as the last three days. This was Saturday so I just hung out in bed. 

6 - very mild congestion 
- woke up feeling myself. No longer required any sort of medications or symptom support. The test was about 75% more faint so I was confident I was on the way to negative.

7 - no symptoms
- First negative test!!

8 - no symptoms
- negative again

9 - no symptoms
- Negative again. Since this is the second 48 hours apart I’m technically no longer contagious and will go about life as I was. 

Other things I did: 
- excessive hydration - at least 64 oz of water a day (my standard) plus teas, electrolyte drinks, etc. I couldn’t cut out coffee as I’m an addict but I reduced my normal intake so I had more room for other options. 
- Past day 2, I made sure I was eating lots of nourishing foods and listening to my body. I struggle with chronic nausea so I’m already pretty good at this, but especially now I’m listening to when I need fruits or carbs or sugars, etc 
- REST. I think this is critical. When I wasn’t actively doing something I was in bed. I took mini breaks at work for 10 minutes to recharge. When I felt my body needing a break I took one without even thinking about it
- Tea every day for the days 1-3. Lemon echinacea with manuka honey at home, then at work I’d swing by Starbucks and get a tall medicine ball. Worked wonders for the sore throat and congestion.
- I really didn’t take medications. Tylenol the first two or three days once a day for the sore throat but that was it. I gradually reduced the supportive care as well, only utilizing what I absolutely needed and letting my body take back over as it could. 
- Got vaccinated in 2020, 2 boosters (including this year). I believe that makes a difference, in addition to building up a viral response. The first time I got covid it was *horrendous.* if I didn’t have to quarantine I would have anyway - I couldn’t function for 5-7 days. This is round 3 and I’m fortunate that it’s been easier each time.

1h0s6r2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h0s6r2,Advice,"I’m renovating my kitchen at home, and as someone who works in commercial coffee, I’ve accumulated a graveyard of equipment—grinders, brewers, espresso machines—you name it. Right now, I’m trying to decide between two machines for my new kitchen setup.

I have a La Marzocco Linea EE that I keep at my office and a La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi II at home. Here’s my dilemma: The Vivaldi is solid, but it’s not the most attractive machine and feels clunky for the sleek, modern design I’m going for in the kitchen. On the other hand, the Linea would look amazing if I had it powder-coated in a cool color (I have a hookup for $300). However, it’s a large, commercial-grade machine and definitely overkill for home use.

I’ve been in coffee for 15 years, and the coffee geek in me is dying to go with the Linea—it’s beautiful and would be a dream to use. But the practical side of me knows the Vivaldi makes more sense.

Option 1: Powder-coat the Linea, hard-plumb it into the new kitchen, and live the coffee dream.
Option 2: Stick with the Vivaldi and keep it simple.

I felt isolated all my high school years and that got to a point where I failed an year and started self harming. (im still in school) 
I would lock myself up in my bedroom or bathroom to self harm or cry hence I don't have lock on either of them anymore. They got me a therapist I would drive to every week and she told them about my suicidal thoughts and tried to convince my parents to let me learn how to drive and give more indepence. My mom broke down and cried and promised me she will change because she didnt realise i was getting so hurt. Fast forward it's been 2 Years and  they still haven't let me go anymore on my own. The only times I'm allowed to drive is when I'm going with my parents to run some errands and that's about it. I've never even attended any tuitions.
Other than that I stay in my room all day my eyesight keeps deleting from crying long hours stretch. 
I deleted my social media because it makes me more depressed watching all my high school classmates of 10 years get together and meet up, it's like I never existed in anyone's world.
I have no social life, I have never had one but i always thought one day I would. I have no close friends to talk to. I don't know way around my own village. When I ask her to let me go anywhere she just says I'm not good enough at driving yet/ I'm a girl it isn't safe/ somebody will definitely rape you I'm just protecting you.

I usually don't express any resentment anymore as there's no hope she would understand but I break down every once a while and end up starving myself for days until my mom gets really angry at me and then hits me sometimes or starts screaming at me for troubling her / hurting her by being like this.
that makes me feel even lonelier I have no safe space to talk to and not even a therapist anymore. My mother says I could talk to her if something is wrong but when I do she just goes silent. She blames me for my bad grades and that I used to have good grades when I was ""under her control"".
She accused me of wanting to be a slut and sleep with multiple men and that she should've aborted me.
My dad doesn't do anything to help but also blames My mom for not raising me right when I have one of my meltdowns which makes things worse. it's like I do not have the right to my own emotions either and she makes it about herself.

I've hit a new rock bottom than from 2 years ago because this time I was promised some hope by my therapist that my mother will change because she loves me but it never happened. If this is love I wish she never loved me.
I have been patient these years but things only get worse and I'm getting too depressed to function. I cannot even make friends online anymore because hearing somebody tell me how they took a simple trip to get coffee makes me extremely jealous and I spiral again. 

And these days I'm spiraling way more because I realise I'll be 20 next year and not a teen anymore and
I cannot do this any longer I might end it this time around. These four walls are all I've  known in my life and this kind of life isn't worth enough to keep on living. ",1,1732669304.0,SuicideWatch,2,1.0,False

This bag weighs just under 50lbs with no food/ water. Please take a look and let me know if there's anything you would lose or use instead. 

This bag was put together with the intention of being an INCH bag (I'm never coming home). The scenario that I am preparing for is a large grid down situation for an extended period (months- years). This could be a result of a solar flare, EMP, infrastructure sabotage, ect. The goal of this kit is to get me out of the city's metro area and sustain myself long term in a wilderness setting as I recon city life would become untenable after a number of weeks. 

I am 6'5"", 230lbs, 27 years old, in shape. Not a vet. Just some city slicker who enjoys the outdoors and buys into the fear mongering of apocalypse peddlers.
