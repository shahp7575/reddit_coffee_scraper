About me:

I like hiking, mtb biking, rock climbing.               Cosplay/LARP, and roleplaying games, sutch as D&D.                                              I collect a lot of things, from bones, to coffee cups, to miltary surplus.

Speaking of, I love coffee and tea.         I work out fairly regularly aswell, I prefer to do it outside, but I live somewhere cold (Michigan). Thank cuthulu for planet fitness.

I like to write dystopian fiction, and have a project a year in the making.

I also write music, thats not very good but im trying to get better.

Im trying to move into a vehicle currently, so I can fulfill my life long dream of wandering the world.

Dim lights. A beat-up couch. Neon glow from an old TV screen looping “Chef Showdown: AI Edition.” Crumbs everywhere. A crumpled Paw-ritos bag lies lifeless on the coffee table.

The whole crew is there, draped like throw blankets across the furniture. Dead-eyed. Silent.

Zeke is upside-down in a beanbag, tossing stale popcorn into his mouth and missing.

Milo is curled into a corner with anxiety in his eyes and cheese dust on his shirt.

Wren is half-asleep, holding a history book titled ""Flavors of Forgotten Empires.""

Tessa is gently scrolling on her tablet, checking in on everyone without saying a word.

Jax is chewing something unidentifiable and looking like he’s about to snap.


JAX
(chewing, disgusted)
I don’t even know what this is. It's like... spicy foam?

MILO
(staring at the TV)
I think my stomach gave up three chips ago.

ZEKE
(still upside-down)
Paw-ritos say they’re “bio-adapted for optimal crunch,” so... we’re basically eating science.

JAX
(suddenly stands, furious)
Screw this. Seriously—when’s the last time any of us ate actual food?

WREN
(half-awake)
Well, technically, food doesn’t have to be real to be nutritionally—
(Jax glares)
Okay, okay.

JAX
I mean it. When’s the last time someone cooked for you? Like, made something with heat and a pan and love?

TESSA
(carefully)
Mom used to make lentil stew when I was little. Now it’s just heat-n-eat boxes from The Plant commissary.

MILO
My dad microwaves eggs. Eggs, Jax.

JAX
Exactly. We’re eating factory scrap disguised as dinner. No flavor. No soul.
(beat)
I want real food. Something... old. Something people used to make before we all gave up.

ZEKE
You want flavor. Adventure. Spice. Danger.

JAX
Yes. All of it. If we don’t figure out how to actually eat like humans again, I swear my tongue’s gonna retire.

TESSA
(sits up, curious)
Well… Geraldine might have something. Y’know, the weird garden witch at the end of the block?

WREN
(suddenly alert)
She once told me “The kitchen remembers.” Then handed me a spoon and walked away.

MILO
I don’t like where this is going.

…but I am hungry.

JAX
Then it’s settled. We’re going to Geraldine’s.
Tomorrow. We find real food, or we die trying.

1pz3v0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TRUE_Neville_Goddard/comments/1pz3v0l/summary_part_3_realization/,Summary (part 3): Realization,"Some of what I will say below is based on direct experience, some on study, some on intuition.

The world is perfect and what we call evil is simply an act of ignorance. **Everyone is looking for happiness and evil is the act of looking for it in the wrong place.** Fear, confusion, insecurity lead to evil actions. Ignorance of one’s perfection leads to evil action. God wanted to experience all the possible degrees of ignorance, from a rock to the most advanced living organism. Perfection has no degrees. Only ignorance does. Perfection is the same yesterday, today and forever. Ignorance is a constant state of change, of evolution. Final destination, last stop, is back to perfection.

Neville once said about the human experience: “The drama is from innocence, through experience, to an awakened imagination.” I believe Indian metaphysics is correct and we come into this world many times for thousands of years. I saw myself once in a prehistoric setting hunting in a forest and it was hundreds of thousands of years ago. I believe our purpose in coming back again and again is to awake in the body, to awake to the realization of what we really are, to dispel the illusion that we are a body, that we are separate from other things in nature, and the illusion of general limitation. Neville called this the “Christ state”. Others call it “cosmic consciousness” and Samadhi. Whatever you call it, that is the final goal.

**The closer you get to that state spiritually, the more you are able to control your mind and the material world.** The operation of the Law is purely unconscious for most of our journey. We’re dominated completely by the survival instinct as an individual (self-preservation) and as a species (reproduction). Ever wonder why sex & violence sells so well? Such imagery simply activates our most primordial instincts. From that level we spend countless lifetimes filling our subconscious mind with programs related to the fear of dying. The self-preservation programs include a compulsive tendency to control and manipulate in order to increase our chances of survival. That’s why we constantly seek validation from a state of insecurity. That’s why we feel a need to compete, to conquer, to subjugate and oppress.

This is the kindergarten, elementary and middle school on our spiritual journey of self-education. In spiritual highschool we learn to use the Law more deliberately. In the ninth grade we’re still so bogged down by subconscious programming, we can manifest free coffee and seeing yellow sports cars on the highway, but fail to manifest bigger things. In the twelfth grade we’re able to expand the range of wishes we can materialize successfully, because we have learned how to reprogram our mind. At the spiritual college level, we’re not only operating the Law but also asking ourselves bigger questions about who we really are, our purpose, our relation to the universe. At the graduate level, not only that we find answers to these questions, but we lose most of our interest in the material world and its attractions and become absorbed by the quest for self-realization.

Those who wrote spiritual handbooks like the Bible wanted to create a text that could be used by people regardless of their level and give them the tools they need where they are. Some need a God who is stuck up in heaven looking like an old man, sometimes benevolent, sometimes vengeful. Other people need more advanced instruction being capable of higher levels of spiritual abstraction. Jesus gave food to the thousands, spoke in parables to the hundreds, gave the full meaning to the 12, and revealed higher mysteries to 3 (John, James and Peter). Even from the most advanced he withheld some knowledge when he said “I have more to tell you, but you can’t bear it now”.

In the online space today everything is blurred. Elementary school students and PhD students are all together in the same space and hear the same message. That’s not good because the higher message can crush the mind of those who are still early in their spiritual education. They read “don’t lift a finger” and “the Law always works,” but they are not told that you need to be a PhD candidate to operate at that level. I wish I could tell you that you can jump from elementary to PhD in a single lifetime, but I’d be lying because I don’t believe that. The Promise comes on time, cannot be accelerated. If I have to be dead wrong about something, I’d really like to be wrong on this one.

Be discerning when you start working with the Law. Evaluate where you are and accept it. Most people want things and the Law is just a tool for getting money, jobs, SPs or a more attractive body. Perfectly alright if that’s where you are. You should practice by trying to get the things you want. **Let no one tell you that you must look for union with God if what you really want is money and cars**. No matter what you want, make sure you learn this from someone who understands, who can meet you where you are and guide you, and for the love of God, stay away from middle schoolers who pretend to be graduate level teachers. This includes the vast majority of online coaches and people giving advice on discussion boards.

People look for absolute happiness on the outside, but nobody has ever found it there. Conscious manifesting is only a tool for realizing that happiness is not in people and things. You try to get things and people and you succeed eventually, only to realize that it didn't bring the complete happiness you were looking for. Then you want more and you do it again and the result is the same. At that moment either you wake up and change course or you continue in the illusion that if you keep looking on the outside, one day you’ll find it. The purpose of life is to discover this truth on your own.

1pz3t20,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1pz3t20/story_of_levine_protocol_success_so_far/,Story of Levine protocol success (so far),"This is a story about my (so far) good experience doing a POTS PT protocol, in addition to compression, salt, hydration, medication, and other appropriate lifestyle measures.  I share this to encourage anyone who may be in the fence.

I’m currently on the transitional mid point of the Levine Protocol (it’s like CHOP, but it’s aimed more solidly at adulty-adults, not adolescents/young-adults).  The first part was recumbent cardio and flat-strength training, especially focusing on the upper legs and lower abdomen.  The mid part, here I am, is recumbent cardio with upright-seated calf work and a mix of recumbent cardio, partially upright (non-recumbent stationary bike) and one upright cardio (elliptical or step machine) per week.  

I was starting to feel the benefits of the strength training shortly before I started the middle phase of the program.  Having more muscle at all helps keep the blood from going/staying in my low body, but having that extra muscle engage when I walk and when I shift my weight from leg to leg, do that thing where you move your feet but you stay in a limited space, just to not end up standing still, or when I do the leg squeeze/relax thing, when I can’t move my feet, like in the shower, there’s so much more muscle to help out pressure to help the blood move.  Like, I was really feeling the effects.

I did my first upright cardio last week, and I was honesty pretty nervous.  I drank extra salted water before, and I wore extra compression during (in addition to my all-the-time compression.  I made it a full half hour, and I felt wobbly and very light headed after.  I sat to recover for a bit before I drove home.  

I’ve been feeling INCREDIBLE this week.  Like, my heart rate when I’m sitting is who it usually is when I’m fully asleep, and my heart rate hasn’t been above 105 inside my house.  I was making coffee, standing at the machine, getting the milk, waiting, etc, with a heart rate in the 80’s!!!  

This week might be a blip, but on the whole I have been trending up, in general, and I think the PT protocol has been a huge part of it.  My compression, hydration, medication, and sodium routine has not changed for months.  The only difference is that I’m further along in this PT protocol (the Levine protocol, because I’m in my 30’s, but my understanding is that CHOP is basically the same principle, but more appropriate for youth and young adults).  

\*If anyone is in the fence about trying a POTS-appropriate PT protocol, I want to encourage you to try.\*

My co-pay is $40 a week, I go in once or twice a week, and I have a chart that I do at home.   I purchased ankle weights for the at-home strength portion, and I use small hand weights and cardio machines at my local community rec center.  My PT place also has a slot if that available, and she talked to me about what I had access to and what I could or couldn’t do on my own to keep up with the protocol, in terms of my schedule and my access to things but also in terms of my own capacity, like for example I have ADHD which is a thing I have to realistically consider when it comes to doing things.",2,1767056167.0,POTS,0,1.0,False
1pz3t14,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1pz3t14/holidays_made_here_know_before_you_go/,Holidays Made Here - KNOW BEFORE YOU GO,"I'm a little late on this, but I went to the Holidays Made Here event on Saturday and here's some great intel for anyone looking to go this week:

* **Skip the Warner Bros tour:** Truthfully, I didn't anticipate spending an entire day in Stars Hollow given how small it seemed at first. However, there are so many events, interactive activities, shops, etc that I'm glad that we didn't do the Warner Bros tour first. Granted, my group and I *did* run into someone that we knew that did the tour first but they arrived at around 12pm when Stars Hollow was at its peak capacity. 
* **Get a Luke's Diner Reservation First:** When you first arrive at Stars Hollow you'll enter from where Lorelai's house is. While it's tempting to go there first, we made a beeline to Luke's to get a reservation and our time slot to come back wasn't until 1:00pm. Mind you, we were there at opening, so definitely prioritize Luke's and come back to Lorelai's after. (Especially since Lorelai's is more of a walkthrough experience)
* **The Scavenger Hunt:** Across from Lorelai's there's an information booth where you can purchase scavenger hunt sheets for $16 a person. In my opinion, it was well worth it as my group and I were able to discuss memorable GG moments, got to talk to a lot of employees, and the prize was well worth it! 
* **Take Advantage of the trivia games, cookie decorating, etc early:** While it's tempting to go shopping first, we were so glad that we got most of the activities done early since Stars Hollow started getting packed mid-afternoon. The cookie decorating is free and the cookies themselves were surprisingly not bad!
* **Bathrooms:** From what we saw, there were 2 restroom areas in Stars Hollow and they almost always had a wait. *Highly* recommend being mindful, especially if you're bringing kids, and taking bathroom breaks in a timely manner. Also, opt for the bathrooms near Weston's, the stalls are bigger.
* **Food:** My group and I are somewhat self proclaimed ""foodies"" and the food was okay at best. Skip the coffee bar across from Lorelai's if you can, the pastries were stale when we went. We didn't go to Al's or the pizza place based on previous reviews, but the chicken place next to Gypsy's wasn't too bad! 
* **Bring a reusable tote or backpack if you can:** Okay, on of my biggest gripes when it comes to going to theme parks, traveling, etc is having to carry anything that you buy all day. This was especially true at Stars Hollow since I was buying things left and right, even more so since there aren't any lockers nearby either (unless you count Stars Hollow High heh). Luckily, I brought my Baggu reusable tote and it made it easier to lug stuff around, but fair warning to pack light if possible!
* **Souvenir Shopping:** This was an odd one, but when we went into the Mercantile shop the price for a snowglobe was $14.95 while it was $9.95 at the Warner Bros exit shop. I'm not sure if that was intentional, but something to note. Also, the exit shop has embroidery services for $5, so if you get a cute tote in Stars Hollow I HIGHLY recommend customizing it before you leave.
* **Town Meeting:** I'm not sure if this was the case prior to Saturday, but when we went they weren't taking reservations for the Town Meeting, instead it was based on randomly being selected by staff. Disclaimer, if you are interested in attending a town meeting I highly recommend asking the ""official looking"" employees but PLEASE BE KIND. (See my note on Employees)
* **Employees:** I cannot stress this enough, PLEASE BE KIND TO THE EMPLOYEES. From what we noticed, a lot of them are working all throughout the event and they are so kind and patient! You can really tell that they're happy to be there and actually *want everyone to have an amazing experience.* Truthfully, I feel like one of the best parts of the day was chatting with the employees and asking them about the event, what food they like, what events they've been a part of, etc. I wish I could give kudos to every employee that we interacted that day, but if you get a chance I highly recommend telling Ella, David, and Azeem that they're amazing!
* **Finding Luke and Mrs. Kim:** We were lucky enough to meet Emily Kuroda organically, as in, I had a mouthful of chicken tender when she came up behind me and my sister and put her arms around us(!!!) However, prior to that we saw her at Sookie's saying hi to everyone that was seated doing cookie decorating. IMO it's luck of the draw with her, but I presume that she stays near Mrs. Kim's Antiques. For Luke, just keep an eye out for screaming, cheering and running lol. But in actuality, a key giveaway is seeing security (big guys in all black or with headsets) suddenly pop up and an increase in employees in solid colored sweatshirts and vests with headsets. From our experience, if Luke is at the Diner the best place to wait for him is at Taylor's Shoppe near the pickup counter as that is where the Diner exit is. With that being said, BE RESPECTFUL, that is still an exit and it can become a safety hazard if guests aren't mindful of exit traffic. Also, have your phone ready and don't bring anything for him to sign! As his security mentioned, he doesn't do autographs but he's always happy to take pictures. :)
* **Gilmore Estate:** Controversial, but if the wait time is more than 20mins it is NOT worth it IMO. I won't spoil it, but it is NOT similar to the actual Gilmore estate.
* **Bring Snacks:** This is especially important if you are visiting on a weekend day, since lines can get a bit out of hand at times I highly recommend bringing snacks and finding a cozy place to hang out and take a breather.
* **Feel free to bring a water bottle, but its not needed:** My group and I were pleasantly surprised with how many water dispensers we found around Stars Hollow!

Okay, that's the gist of it, I'm happy to answer any additional questions and I'll add some more info as it comes to my noggin!",1,1767056165.0,GilmoreGirls,0,1.0,False

It grows rods that are completely straight, great for making fences, fun tent frames, tool rods or even blind holders. It keeps sprouting new rods, year after year. And the wood is nice for whittling, and bakes well and dries evenly - for spoons and a sword for the kids. Even the roasted catkins make for a very decent coffee-tea-ish nutty beverage. And then theres the nuts.. besides attracting lovely squirrels, if you can best them, those nuts go great in cooking and baking, fresh or dried. And dried, keeps for ages!

Those old groves of hazel mustve been established by people who just took it for granted, that youd need at least a couple good hazels to supply your home. But thats a simpler time.. nowadays, people have forgotten all about their use.

On a once-in-a-blue-moon occasion, I was actually organised for work. Not fake organised—properly, spiritually organised. Every essential accounted for: a perfectly packed lunch, stainless steel cutlery, portable charger, wires of unknown but vital purpose, a carrier bag for spillages, and above all else… my coffee cup.

This was not a coffee cup. This was the Rolls-Royce, the Bentley, the SpaceX launch of beverage containment. The way the lid screwed on? NASA tolerances. The weight? Reassuring. Grounding. When that cup was in my hand, I was untouchable. A monk. A king. A man at peace. It carried the finest coffee beans from all corners of the globe during our time together.

That cup lived a good life. I treated it with care, and it loved me back. Especially the lid. Sweet Jesus, the lid. I could write novels about it. No cross-threading. No leaks. No fucking about. One twist. Done. Every time. A one-hit wonder. One less anxiety in a cruel, chaotic world. Every morning I woke up knowing that lid would not betray me. More reliable than an Albanian coke dealer. I am actively emotional writing this.

And then—some absolute oxygen thief robbed my bag with it inside.

Forget the iPhone. Keep it. Frame it. Sell it. I don’t care. I want my fucking coffee cup back.

So if by some miracle you’re reading this: do the right thing. Return it to its rightful owner. And if you lack the moral backbone for that, then at the very least treat it with the RESPECT it deserves. Wash it. Dry it properly. Screw the lid on gently. And do not—under any circumstances—fill it with that instant granule shit.

Changes have gotten smaller between versions, so I think this will be my last QCRIT unless someone points out something new and major that changes my approach. 

  
Dear Agent,

I am seeking representation for my 76,000 word science fiction novel *What Keeps the Stars Apart*. This novel combines galactic scale, several timelines, and multiple points of view with emotionally intimate prose and characters in a similar style to *The Vanished Birds* by Simon Jimenez while incorporating the apocalyptic stakes of *Stars and Bones* by Gareth L. Powell.

Amir Younis is the Astronomer, one of the five academics crewing the Galactic History Preservation starship *Absolution*. The crew has drifted between the stars for thousands of years, waking from cryogenic fugue for a short time in each new system to fulfill their mission of recording humanity’s fragmented history in a continuous, interstellar narrative. Upon entering a star system where their records indicate an interplanetary civilization flourished mere thousands of years ago, the Astronomer’s probes report a complete apocalypse. They’ve seen graveyard worlds before—but when their geological survey shows no record of anthropomorphic habitation anywhere in the planet’s deep past, this desolated world becomes a paradox that threatens the crew’s understanding of their own purpose. When the next system is desolated as well, and reports come in from other GHP teams that civilizations present in their records have also vanished from every world they visit, the paradox evolves into a crisis.

The Astronomer and their crew live solely for the preservation of knowledge, but now are confronted with the fact that knowledge is nothing without a future to inherit it. As the crew races to solve the mystery of the desolations before all of humanity is destroyed, they discover that their memories have been manipulated. They can’t remember anything from their lives before the *Absolution*. While they work to recover humanity’s future and their own past, the Astronomer fears that if the crew remembers who they are—and what they’ve lost—grief will destroy them. 

\[Bio/Personalization\]

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

Name

**First 250 Words**

The Astronomer woke to silence. Right on cue, their cryogenic sleeping pod had initiated waking procedures as the *Absolution* decelerated into the Alpha-8457 star system. The rest of the crew still slept. The chance of pod failure was less than ten-thousand to one—it had to be—but still the Astronomer checked every one, running manual diagnostics each time. It was habit. When you spent thousands of years adrift in the emptiness between the stars, habit was all you had—that, and your crew. They all came back green. 

Everyone on a Galactic History Preservation team got used to traveling in cryosleep, but no one ever came to like it. If they did, the Astronomer thought, their psych profile should probably be reevaluated. A person taking the long nap was biologically almost dead, and they woke up feeling that way.

After the head, the Astronomer’s first stop was at the autodoc. They drank a liter of water and, needing something with a little more kick than coffee, took some mild amphetamines prescribed by the system. Other than the temporary brain fog, their body appeared perfectly ship-shape. The Biologist would have gently chided that the human body is an enormously complex organism and that keeping it working nearly perfectly for thousands of years was a miracle that should never be taken for granted. But she was asleep, so fuck biology. The Astronomer took more amphetamines and moved on to what had long ago become their favorite part of being conscious—long, hot showers.

Otherwise, Google Lens is likely to tell you ""This is a picture of sunglasses on some wanker's face"" or ""This is a photo of sunglasses lying on a coffee table littered with empty beer cans, cigarette butts, and what appears to be a bong.""

**NOTE:** Google Lens--and the AI driving it--is sometimes as dumb as a bag of hair. It is frequently wrong. If it tells you that the Ray-Bans are Oakley sunglasses, try adding Ray-Ban and other keywords to the search by posting a follow-up question. Google Lens may continue to insist that the glasses are Oakleys. If so, tell Google Lens to sod off.

Post as much information as possible about the mystery glasses. If you're attempting to ID a pair of glasses, where did you see them? In what context? For instance, did you see a celebrity wearing them in a photo taken from People magazine? Knowing the celebrity's name and where the photo appeared may help others to ID the glasses. (Also, stop reading People; it's dreck.)

**Real or Fake? Authenticating Ray-Bans**

If you're trying to authenticate a pair of Ray-Bans, tell us as much as possible about them. Consider answer the following questions, and others like them:

* Where did you get them?
* How much did you pay?
* Are they for sale? Where? For how much? Do you really think that you can buy a brand-new pair of Aviators online for $29.99? If so, did you know that if you hold a banana to your ear you'll hear the word ""gullible""?

Perhaps most important: Post as many of the following photos as you can:

* straight-on view
* view from the rear with the temples extended
* side view showing any logos and embellishments and showing, as well, the angle formed by the lens and the temples (called the ""panoptic tilt"").
* clear, legible shots of the inside of each temple, showing all of the writing found there. With vintage B&L glasses, look for and photograph any impressions on the ear pieces (for example, W1596 YUAS--the model code for B&L Traditionals Style 4).
* shots of the impressions on the top or bottom of the bridge
* clear shot of the Ray-Ban logo on the right lens (or the absence of the logo)
* clear shot of the RB or BL logo etched into one or both lenses. It can be difficult to capture the logo. Try placing a black piece of paper behind it, or positioning the glasses so that a light illuminates the logo itself or the area around it.
* shots of the front, back, and inside of the case, clearly showing in detail the stitching and the snap closure (or other closure)
* shots of the packaging, including the grey gift box. Fake gift boxes are shiny and smooth; genuine gift boxes are dull and mottled.
* shots of the product box holding the glasses, including a shot of the sticker on the end of the box. Be sure to include a clear shot of the QR code printed on that sticker. Scanning the QR code on the box should give back a 24-character string of alphanumeric characters, used for internal product tracking by Ray-Ban. If it gives back a URL for Ray-Ban or Luxottica, then the box is fake (and probably the glasses, as well). If it gives back nothing, it's not a QR code, and the box is decidedly fake.
* shots of any product literature accompanying the glasses

That's all the advice I have right now for improving your chances of identifying or authenticating a pair of Ray-Bans. I'll add to this post if I think of other tips, so please save it for later by clicking on the three dots alongside the title of the post.",2,1767055976.0,rayban,0,1.0,False

Artisanal roasts emphasise careful sourcing, small‑batch roasting, and distinctive flavour profiles.

Independent roasters work closely with farmers and cooperatives to highlight origin, altitude, and processing style in every cup [(Global Coffee Platform, 2025)](https://www.globalcoffeeplatform.org/latest/2025/sustainable-coffee-purchases-report-2024/).

Because of this, “artisanal roasts” often offer more transparency than mass‑produced blends.

UK customers increasingly search for **local coffee**, “coffee shop near me,” and “best coffee beans” to discover these quality‑focused brands [(Lavazza Professional, 2024)](https://www.lavazzapro.co.uk/blog/2024-uk-coffee-statistics/).

Made me think about how I'm the main character in my own life. Every moment feels significant to me. My embarrassments are huge, my accomplishments matter, my daily struggles are the plot.

But to everyone else I'm just an extra. That person they saw at the coffee shop. A face in the background. Maybe a minor character in one scene but definitely not the focus.

That interaction that felt so important to me, where I said something awkward? They probably don't even remember. I'm replaying it and they've already moved on to their actual life where they're the main character and I barely registered. It's kind of freeing honestly.

Pulled from neuroscience research, psychology podcasts, books on digital minimalism, and yeah, my own embarrassing screen time reports.

The wild thing? Your brain literally treats social media like a slot machine. Every scroll is a pull of the lever. Sometimes you get a banger meme, sometimes it's your ex's engagement photos. The unpredictability keeps you hooked harder than if every post was amazing. It's called variable ratio reinforcement and casinos have been using it for decades.

But here's what actually works to break free:

Understand Your Brain Is Being Hacked, Not Broken

Your dopamine system wasn't designed for infinite content. Dr Anna Lembke (Stanford psychiatrist) explains in ""Dopamine Nation"" that we're living in an era of dopamine overload. The book breaks down how pleasure and pain work on the same neural pathways, which is why you feel so empty after a scroll session. Insanely good read if you want to understand why modern life feels so exhausting. She's one of the leading addiction experts and this book made me rethink everything about my phone habits.

The basic science: every scroll releases a tiny hit of dopamine. Your brain adapts by reducing dopamine receptors. Now you need MORE scrolling to feel normal. It's not weakness, it's biology.

Replace the Void, Don't Just Create One

Deleting apps cold turkey usually fails because you're left with this massive hole in your routine. Instead, redirect that energy.

Picked up Notion recently for tracking creative projects. Sounds nerdy but having a visual board of ""things I'm actually making"" hits different than watching other people's highlight reels. Duolingo works too if you've been pretending you'll learn Spanish someday. The streaks give you that achievement dopamine but you're actually building something.

BeFreed is a personalized audio learning app built by AI experts from Google that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom podcasts based on what you want to learn. You type in a skill or goal (like ""improve my writing"" or ""understand my dopamine patterns""), and it generates a learning plan tailored to you. The depth is fully customizable, from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. What makes it addictive is the voice options. You can pick a smoky, sarcastic narrator or even a deep, sexy voice like Samantha from the movie Her. Since most listening happens during commutes or at the gym, having that voice control actually matters. Plus, there's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about your struggles, and it'll recommend content based on its understanding of you. Way more engaging than just reading about breaking phone addiction.

Cal Newport's ""Digital Minimalism"" is the blueprint here. He's a computer science professor at Georgetown who basically said forget the attention economy and here's how to opt out. The book will make you question everything you think you know about technology and productivity. His approach isn't about going off grid, it's about being intentional. Includes a 30 day digital declutter that actually works.

Make Friction Your Friend

The easier something is, the more you'll do it. So make doomscrolling annoying as hell.

Log out of everything after each use. Sounds stupid but having to type your password every time creates just enough friction. Move social apps off your home screen into a folder buried on page 3. Turn your phone grayscale (settings, accessibility, color filters). Instagram looks way less appealing in black and white.

For the creation part, do the opposite. Leave your notebook open. Keep your guitar out of its case. Make starting easier than scrolling.

Use the 5 Minute Rule

Saw this on Huberman Lab podcast (neuroscientist at Stanford, guy knows his stuff about dopamine and motivation). Your brain's resistance to starting something is usually strongest in the first 5 minutes. Just commit to 5 minutes of creating ANYTHING. Write 3 sentences. Sketch one thing. Record 30 seconds of a voice memo.

Usually you'll keep going because starting was the only real obstacle. If you don't, whatever, you still did more than scrolling.

Embrace Strategic Boredom

This sounds counterintuitive but boredom is where creativity actually happens. Your default mode network (the part of your brain that generates ideas) only activates when you're NOT consuming content.

Try this: next time you're in line, in the bathroom, waiting for coffee, just stand there. No phone. Let your mind wander. Feels weird at first but this is when random ideas start bubbling up.

Insight Timer has guided meditations specifically for building boredom tolerance. Free app, way better than Headspace imo. They've got tracks on breaking phone addiction and reclaiming attention span.

Reframe What You're Losing vs Gaining

Every hour spent scrolling is an hour you could've spent making something that didn't exist before. Could be terrible, could be amazing, doesn't matter. The act of creation changes your brain chemistry differently than consumption.

Read ""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield. This book is SHORT but absolutely brutal in the best way. He calls the force that stops you from creating ""resistance"" and breaks down exactly how it operates. He's written screenplays, novels, all that, but this isn't a how-to-write book. It's about showing up and doing the work despite every part of you wanting to scroll instead.

James Clear (Atomic Habits guy) talks about identity based habits. Instead of ""I want to create more,"" try ""I am a creator who sometimes scrolls"" vs ""I am a scroller who sometimes creates."" Small shift, big difference.

Track Your Relapses Without Judgment

Gonna relapse into doomscrolling sometimes. That's fine. The key is noticing the pattern without spiraling into self hatred.

What triggered it? Boredom, anxiety, avoiding something hard? Once you spot the pattern you can interrupt it earlier next time.

Find Accountability That Doesn't Suck

Telling yourself you'll create more rarely works. External accountability does.

Beeminder is this weird app that charges you real money if you don't hit your goals. Sounds harsh but the financial sting works. Set it to track ""30 minutes of creation daily"" or whatever fits.

Or just text a friend every day with what you made. One sentence. Keeps you honest without being preachy about it.

The thing is, we've somehow normalized spending HOURS watching other people live their lives while ours passes by. That's not rest, that's not connection, that's just nothing. Creating something, even something small and stupid, means you existed that day beyond just consuming.

Your brain will resist at first because scrolling is easier. But easier isn't better. And unlike the endless feed, the stuff you create actually compounds. That terrible sketch improves your next one. That weird paragraph becomes part of a bigger thing eventually.

The gap between who you are and who you could be is filled with all the hours you're currently spending scrolling. Not trying to be dramatic but like, what do you actually have to lose by trying?",1,1767055889.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

In the bank parking lot she had her head out of the window watching the cars zoom by with that big old grin on her face.

On the way home Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol came on. I’ve always loved this song. I remember being in highschool laying on the floor with my eyes closed and listening to it on my iPod. I could never relate it to any of my romantic relationships or friendships though.

But tonight, on this drive, it hit me…everything he was singing is exactly how I feel towards Lola. We live alone together (with our cat) and we’ve been on quite the journey together this last year…leaving a long term relationship, moving to a different state, having our housing being up in the air.

Sometimes I lie on the floor with her and everything else falls away. Rubbing her soft ears or leaning against her while she chews her bone. She’ll snuggle into me on the couch every morning when I have my coffee and her weight on me is the most comforting thing. If I cry she finds her way to me and will nudge my arms or lick my face.

She’s reactive at times. It can be difficult and frustrating but she reminds me no matter how frustrated I get my well of love for her is always deeper. And she gives me grace on the days I’m not perfect or don’t feel well enough to run around with her. She reminds me that there’s always time to toss a ball or be a little silly.

I was never even a dog person but my ex was allergic to cats and I wanted company and responsibility. I’m still not the biggest dog person but I am 100% a Lola person.

She’s 7 now and sometimes I think about how she’s not going to be with me forever and it’s deeply saddening. She’s the purest love I’ve ever experienced in life and maybe ever will.",2,1767055828.0,self,3,1.0,False
1pz3nuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pz3nuj/im_pregnant_married_and_having_an_affair_with_my/,"I’m pregnant, married, and having an affair with my neighbor","I’m a stay at home mom to a 3 year old, and I’m 28 weeks pregnant with my second baby. My husband and I have been married for 4 years, together for 8 years total.

I’ve been having an affair with my neighbor for the past 5 months or so. It’s been longer than that if you count the time before it became physical.

My husband doesn’t like me, let alone love me. He wants me around for what I can do for him…sex, carry and birth his kids, cook his meals, keep his house in order and take care of all of the household related needs, and look nice next to him when he needs somebody for that sort of thing. I didn’t understand all of this when we were dating or even when we first got married. It’s not like he’s ever said any of this out right, but it’s obvious. 

He critiques me (my appearance, the way I do or don’t do a chore). If I ask him an innocent question he responds back in the harshest, most cruel tone - as if whatever I asked was the most stupid question he’s ever heard or as if I’m accusing him or something terrible wrongdoing. 

Just today he told me to not speak and act as if I didn’t exist. He also helps with nothing at home and I’ve learned to not even ask anymore. If I do ask, he gets mean, rolls his eyes, gets an attitude, and often finds something I didn’t do up to his standards and insults me about it…as if that’s any reason as to why he shouldn’t help out around the house.

He persuaded me to become a SAHM after our first baby was born. I liked the idea at first. I wanted to be home with the baby. But things got worse after that and I realized I was sort of trapped since I didn’t go into it with much money or savings of my own. 

We have sex when he wants it, but only when he wants it. 

He’s physically hurt me on many occasions. The most recent was the week before Christmas when he got mad at something I said and dragged me harshly by the wrist from the livingroom into the kitchen. Her grabbed me so tight he left finger shaped bruises on my wrist. 

It wasn’t always like this. I now realize it all happened very slowly over time. In the beginning, he swept me off my feet. He spoiled me. He made me feel like what I thought love was supposed to feel like, at the time. His little insults, his controlling nature, and his physical abuse trickled out soooo incredibly slowly that it was hard to even recognize most of it until later on. 

I want to divorce so bad, but I’m scared. He’s told me he’ll make my life a living hell if I try to leave him, and he’ll also do whatever it takes to get custody of our kids. I’m scared of what he’ll do. He seems to just have so many resources, knows so many people in all lines of work and influential important people around where we live. I’m on my own, states away from family. I’ve never had a job since living here, so my connections here are slim. 

I don’t believe in cheating. I don’t feel bad cheating on him at all though. I don’t feel bad towards him, you could say. I feel bad that I’m doing something that inherently is wrong and I’m ashamed of that part, but I don’t actually care about my husband’s feelings at all.

My neighbor is truly the greatest guy I’ve ever met. Meeting him, well before it turned into anything, made me realize just how horrible a man my husband actually is. Is made me realize the traits that I really should have been looking for in a husband, characteristics my husband never had even when he was pretending to be a nice person who loved me. It was all smoke and mirrors with my husband. 

My neighbor is in his early 30s. He’s an attorney, not the divorce kind though. Although he’s doing all he can to convince me to leave my husband. He clocked my husband as a bad person right away, and I think my husband has always sort of known that which pisses him off even more. The neighbor picked up on things going on in our home. He’s heard the yelling. He’s outright heard the way my husband speaks to me when we’ve been outside, and before he even knew me he stepped in the defend me against my husband. 

He’s so laid back, happy, positive, helpful, kind, confident and not defensive or cruel. He enjoys life and doesn’t complain about every single thing and every single person he meets. My husband doesn’t like to do anything, at least not with me. We don’t have fun together. We don’t do anything together anymore. No dates, no just hanging out, nothing. 

My neighbor works remotely from home some of the time. We really just started talking in our backyards, which are right next to each other. It started off that way, just casual talk across the border of our yards. My daughter and I spend a lot of time out there because dive thrown myself into landscaping my our entire bare backyard, and learning to garden has provided me with some sort of solace. Eventually we started crossing the border into each other’s backyards. He was more natural with my daughter than her own father is - her own father yells when she cries and tells me it’s my job to handle her when she cries. Just the other day she was playing on the livingroom floor. My husband was in the livingroom. I was in the kitchen cooking and I had to pass by the livingroom momentarily - I didn’t see her in there where she’d been playing. I asked him where she was and he said “I don’t know, that’s your job.” 

So the neighbor knows everything that’s going on. He’s been trying to convince me to divorce. He’s offered to try to connect me with help. This was all before anything happened between us. He just became one of my only friends here, and the only confidant I had that knew about what was really going on behind closed doors. 

He’s had girlfriends in that time, two of which I’ve met. They didn’t last very long. I admittedly felt some jealousy when I met them. I knew that wasn’t a good sign. I convinced myself I was really just jealous of the idea that they had this opportunity to be with this wonderful guy that is like what many women dream of, and I’d made the mistake of getting myself stuck with the steaming turd of a man I married. 

Sometimes we’d go places together during the day when my husband was at work. We’d never go anywhere in the car, as that felt like it was somehow crossing the line. We’d only walk places, like the local park, or to one of the coffee shops or restaurants within walking distance. I had my child with me as well, and somehow that made me feel like it was totally innocent, we were just friends, and there was nothing wrong with it. And it was still innocent, even if I’d developed feelings for him. I knew my husband wouldn’t see it as innocent though. 

Then one day we kissed. It was in his kitchen on a Saturday afternoon. We both immediately said it was a bad idea and that it shouldn’t go further. He worried about what would happen to me if my husband found out. 

My husband got it in his head that it would be a good time to have another baby. Why? He doesn’t help take care of the one we already have. He’ll do the fun things when she’s being good. He also loves to go in and play with her immediately after I’ve just calmed her down from a meltdown or finally gotten her to lay down for a nap. He’ll do the necessary things, but only when I ask him to, and he always gives an attitude when I do. If I have to go run errands and leave her with him, I have to text him to remind him to put her down for a nap or to feed her lunch. He’ll respond with a “fine!” So annoying! 

I didn’t want to have another baby because I knew I’d be doing all the work again. I also knew that we shouldn’t be bringing another baby into this whole mess. I obeyed. I stopped taking my birth control. I didn’t want to. I hate myself for doing it. It’s so hard to explain, and I don’t mean for it to sound like an excuse, but he just as this way of getting me to do what he wants. I feel like a shell of myself, like I don’t even know who I am or how to speak with my own voice anymore. I’ve just given up fighting him. It’s easier when I don’t fight him. 

I got pregnant within about 2 months. Every time I took a pregnancy test I prayed it would be negative. I was devastated when I saw the positive test result. 

The baby is not my neighbor’s baby. We didn’t have sex for the first time until after I was pregnant. We came close several times, but always stopped ourselves. I told him everything, and he knew about my husband wanting another baby. He begged me not to do it. He sort of stepped back when I told him I was going to give in to what my husband wanted.

After I got pregnant, things seemed to change. Idk, it was like he understood why I had given in to my husband. He became more caring, more protective, more of a safe place for me. We had sex for the first time when I was around 3 months pregnant. I hate the term “make love” with a passion, but if such a thing exists than that’s what having sex with him feels like. I’ve never felt anything like it with my husband, even when our relationship was “good.” 

I’m home alone with a toddler all day, and he only works from home some of the time, so it’s not like we’re having sex on a daily basis. Any time we can be together though, we are. He’s told me he wishes it was his baby I was carrying, and I can’t tell you how much I wish that was the case. I feel safe and happy and loved when I’m with him. I’d do anything to be carrying his baby instead, and that’s what I pretend when we’re together. I just erase my husband from my brain for a little bit.

I have told myself that 2026 will be the year that I get divorced, and I hope I will follow through with it. I’ve been so close on several occasions over the past 2 years, but always get too scared and pulled back in. My news years resolution is to get a divorce. ",1,1767055781.0,TrueOffMyChest,7,0.56,False

Laid there for a minute expecting the usual guilt. That voice saying I'm wasting the day, being lazy, should be productive. But it didn't come. Just felt good. Got up eventually, made coffee, sat on my couch doing absolutely nothing for another hour. Middle of the day on a weekend and my only plan was no plans.

Meanwhile saw my coworker Monday who has kids and she looked destroyed. Up at 5:30 because that's when her toddler decided the day starts, spent the whole weekend managing meltdowns and activities, never had a moment to herself. Then laughed it off like ""but it's worth it.""

Maybe it is for her. But I looked at my peaceful Saturday morning and felt genuinely grateful for my choice. No guilt about sleeping in, no FOMO about missing out on parenthood. Just appreciation for the life I've built.

With aging comes not only physical changes but also shifts in mood, stress response, and overall vitality. That’s why herbal supplements like **Panax Ginseng**—often called “Korean Red Ginseng”—have gained increasing popularity among those who want to support their health naturally without relying solely on pharmaceutical options.

But what exactly does Panax Ginseng do for the body? Is it truly effective for people in their 40s, 50s, and beyond? And what does science say about its benefits?

This article breaks down the research behind Panax Ginseng in a simple, easy-to-understand format. Whether you're just curious or already considering adding it to your daily wellness routine, this guide will help you make an informed decision based on facts—not hype.

# What Is Panax Ginseng?

Panax Ginseng is a medicinal root that has been used in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine for over 2,000 years. It is known for its **adaptogenic properties**, which means it helps the body cope with physical and emotional stress. The most active compounds in Panax Ginseng are called **ginsenosides**, and they are thought to affect energy metabolism, brain function, and immune response.

Unlike American Ginseng or Siberian Ginseng, **Panax Ginseng** (also known as Korean Ginseng) is specifically prized for its energizing and cognitive-enhancing effects. It is typically consumed in capsule, powder, or liquid extract form.

# 5 Proven Benefits of Panax Ginseng for Adults Over 40

**1. Boosts Physical Energy Without Jitters**  
Studies show that Panax Ginseng can reduce fatigue and increase physical endurance, making it ideal for adults who feel ""sluggish"" as they age. Unlike caffeine, it provides steady energy without the crash.

**2. Supports Cognitive Function**  
Research suggests that ginseng may help improve memory, focus, and mental clarity, especially in older adults. It is often used as a nootropic (brain supplement) in natural medicine circles.

**3. May Help Regulate Blood Sugar**  
Several studies have shown that Panax Ginseng can help reduce fasting blood sugar levels in people with or without diabetes. This makes it a promising supplement for metabolic health.

**4. Supports Immune Function**  
Ginseng has immunomodulatory effects, meaning it can help balance and strengthen your immune system over time—especially helpful for people over 40 whose immunity may decline naturally.

**5. Improves Stress Resilience**  
As an adaptogen, Panax Ginseng supports your adrenal system, helping you manage emotional stress and hormonal imbalances more effectively.

1pz3ivn,https://www.reddit.com/r/1zpresso/comments/1pz3ivn/can_grinding_at_a_45_angle_or_horizontally_be/,Can grinding at a 45° angle or horizontally be detrimental to a manual mill?,"A few days ago I bought two 1zpresso grinders, a J-Ultra for espresso and a ZP6 Special for pour-over. Since I'm a total coffee fanatic and I'm not satisfied with just grinding and brewing coffee, I've spent the last few days researching how to get the best results in my cup.

I've been reading a lot about the results you get in grind consistency when you tilt the grinder 45 degrees. Apparently, tilting the grinder produces fewer fine particles and a more homogeneous and consistent grind. This raises several questions for me:

1) Could grinding at an angle be harmful to the grinder? Because it's tilted, the burrs would be working more on one side than the other, potentially damaging the grinder. This is because it exerts a lateral and off-center force, or even causes uneven wear on the burrs, wearing them down more on one side than the other, ultimately harming both the grinder and the long-term grind results.

2) When grinding for espresso with a J-Ultra at a 45° angle, I understand there will be fewer fine particles, and I'll need to lower the grind setting a few clicks because, with fewer fine particles, the water will pass through the coffee puck more quickly during extraction.

My questions are:

- When grinding without tilting and producing more fine particles, does the coffee have more body? And when grinding at an angle and producing fewer fine particles, does the coffee have more clarity? - Does grinding at a 45° angle actually produce a higher quality cup, generating fewer fine particles and resulting in a clearer coffee? Or does it simply depend on personal preference? If you like a fuller-bodied coffee, should you grind at a flat angle to obtain more fine particles and a fuller cup?

I also wonder if, by grinding at a 45-degree angle, I'll generate fewer fine particles and a more homogeneous and consistent grind, I could achieve more body in the cup by grinding finer, and greater clarity by grinding coarser?

3) When grinding for pour-over with the ZP6, I have more or less the same questions as in point 2, where I discussed grinding with the J-Ultra. The ZP6 produces significantly fewer fine particles than the J-Ultra, which is why it's specifically designed for pour-over and for achieving high clarity in the cup.


• The dilemma for both pour-over and espresso is: Which parameter should I vary to achieve better results? Is it better to tilt the grinder or not tilt it to achieve more body or clarity, and in turn, a more or less homogeneous grind? Or is it better to always grind at an angle to achieve a more consistent and homogeneous grind, and grind finer for more body or coarser for more clarity?

• And I also have another question: For pour-over, do finer particles result in a cup with more body or a more bitter cup?


Finally, and I think this is asking too much: How can I achieve juicier and sweeter results with ZP6? Because from what I've read, 1zpresso K-Ultra produces cups with less clarity and less flavor separation than ZP6, but with more sweetness and juiciness. I think I'll solve this last issue by also buying a K-Ultra because I've read that depending on the type of coffee and the brewing process, the K-Ultra works better for some and the ZP6 for others.

My intention with this post is to see if I've understood all the information I've been reading these past few days correctly, and to clear up any doubts I have, because otherwise my head is going to explode from thinking so much.

I'm passionate about this world of coffee where there's always something new to learn to further improve the results in the cup of coffee.

Sorry for the long post, but I'm a damn perfectionist and, on top of that, an obsessive and ultra-geeky coffee fanatic, and this whole thing about manual grinders has opened a lot of doors to close and a lot of doubts to resolve.

For whatever reason some weeks later  I asked Gemeni out of the blue if doctors receive kickbacks and it said no and mentioned a couple of laws, but it also mentioned a grey area where doctors can be compensated for different things like consulting, dining, presentations.

anyways. i’ve found my solution. it fits 5 sticky note sets, 3 micro sets, more pens/highlighters/markers than truly anyone needs, and a decent amount of miscellaneous accessories. it folds up and then stands up which is suuuper helpful. also worth nothing: it stands both on the couch and on a table/desktop.

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣 

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official.

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, underneath the roots will be dark brow and my ends dark brown.

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends  and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣 

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now? 

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂 

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting? 

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks? 

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink? 

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣  

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

Yeah, I don't respond to hi messages, hi and 👋 emoji, obviously I'm quite unsure how to respond to that 🤣

I've been texting this girl for some time now. We both didn't manage to make time to see each other due to living in different cities, but we planned to go for coffee around early January.

The reason I'm asking this question is because during the period that we have been texting, she never texted me first. I was, and I am the only one who texts first. So I'm a bit worried, and I started to overthink about her interest in me even though texting with her is very nice and it is going very well and it's not dry at all. 

I guess I can 100% know when we meet, but the texting-first part is killing me haha.

So I'm wondering, do you usually text first, and if not, do you text first to people you like or find interesting?",3,1767055014.0,infj,6,0.8,False

She was in no pain, she died peacefully at home with all of us there (though not in the room when it happened). I've held a lot of regret about a lot of things. 

Specifically, a small part of me thinks she could've lived longer if we hadn't allowed her doctor to send her to a SNF for a small bit of time. She lost weight there and became incontinent and that really began the decline to hospice. 

Before that, my mom had developed cancer and was going through radiation. She was unable to eat, barely get out of bed. We were giving her fluids through IV, trying to get her to sip on fluids, etc while caring for my grandmother who, at the time, was beginning to decline more. We fed her in her room because it was so much work getting her to the kitchen. She could still feed herself then. We came back to her laying back trying to drink coffee and told her she had to sit up. I should've recognized that she likely couldn't hold herself up as well anymore and maybe somethign could've been done. 

The sad part of this is that *now* I'm an RN. I know *some* of this isn't factual, that she would've declined anyway. But the personal, emotional side of me can't be convinced. I'm currently caring for my mom with alcoholic dementia and the regret and anxiety is overwhelming at times. I'm always in a deep state of grief.",2,1767054899.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

So, you know how life just *happens*? Well, last night, it happened in the form of a full glass of red wine meeting my pristine, light-colored couch. I seriously thought it was a goner. Panic mode activated!

### The Savior Arrives

I remembered seeing a lot of love for the **Bissell Little Green Portable Spot Carpet Cleaner, 1400B** on here, so I frantically ordered one. And let me tell you, it arrived just in time.

I was skeptical, honestly. Could this little guy really tackle a deep red wine stain? The answer is a resounding YES!

### How I Used It (Super Easy!)

*   **Pre-treat (optional but recommended):** I used a little bit of my usual upholstery cleaner on the stain.
*   **Fill it up:** The machine is super simple to fill with water and a cleaning solution. It doesn't hold a ton, which is perfect for spot cleaning.
*   **Spray and Blot:** I sprayed the stained area and then used the built-in hose and brush to gently scrub. The suction is surprisingly powerful for its size!
*   **Repeat:** I went over it a couple of times, sucking up the dirty water. The water that came out was *gross*, but also proof it was working.

### The Results

I'm not even exaggerating – the stain is GONE. Like, completely vanished. No residue, no watermark, just my couch looking like it did before the wine incident. It also worked wonders on a coffee stain my dog *accidentally* made earlier in the week. This thing is a game-changer for pet owners and clumsy people like me!

If you're on the fence about getting one, I highly recommend it. It's small, lightweight, and incredibly effective for those inevitable spills and messes. Totally worth the investment!

1pz38c8,https://archiveofourown.org/works/75083091/chapters/196198801,Star and stripe learns about her friends new girlfriend (werewolf the apocalypse x mha au) stripe and claws,"Cathleen Bate arrived at Los Angeles Hero Academy at 6:12 a.m. sharp, clutching a cardboard tray of overpriced coffees like a white flag.

 She wore civilian clothes—jeans, boots, and an oversized hoodie that hid the fact she’d slept in her costume for three days straight. Her hair was in a messy ponytail, and her eyes were still puffy from crying on Vincent’s very expensive rug.

She needed to prep her slides for the supernatural-threat elective.

 More than that, she needed to fix things with Ironclad.

She found his office door cracked open.

 From inside came the unmistakable soundtrack of two people trying to inhale each other’s faces.

Cathleen hesitated exactly 0.8 seconds, then knocked with her knuckle.

A muffled curse, the squeak of a chair, the thud of someone hitting the floor.

“Come in!” Ironclad barked, voice an octave higher than usual.

Cathleen pushed the door open.

Ironclad—shirt half-buttoned, steel skin flushed gunmetal gray—scrambled upright while a stunning redhead with wild curls and predator-green eyes calmly zipped up her janitor’s jumpsuit. Lipstick was smeared across Ironclad’s neck like war paint. The woman’s lips were swollen and grinning.

Cathleen’s brain took a hard reboot.

Ironclad cleared his throat so hard it echoed. “Cathleen. You’re… early.”

The redhead waved like they were at a barbecue. “Order-who-Claws! Huge honor, truly.” She stuck out a hand. “Matilda Red-Howl, Red Talons tribe. Also this walking tin opener’s girlfriend.”

Cathleen slapped a hand over Matilda’s mouth before the entire hallway heard. “Shhhhh! Cathleen. Just Cathleen inside the building, please.”

Matilda licked Cathleen’s palm in retaliation, then flashed a canine grin. “Got it, Cathleen-just-Cathleen.”

Ironclad rubbed the back of his neck, mortified. “Matilda, boundaries.”

Cathleen’s eyebrows attempted to flee into orbit. “Red Talons? As in the ‘humanity is a cancer, burn it all’ Red Talons?”

Matilda shrugged, completely unbothered. “Not all of us. Some of us think certain humans smell like good mates.” She leaned over and nipped Ironclad’s ear hard enough to make him jump. “Really good mates.”

Ironclad made a noise like a broken foghorn.

Cathleen’s smirk could have sliced bread. “So the guy who once told me—direct quote—‘the only good Garou is a dead Garou’ is dating a Red Talon Lupus. The irony is so thick I could spread it on toast.”

Ironclad glared. “What the hell is a Lupus-born?”

Matilda’s ears—actual wolf ears hidden under glamour until now—flattened. Her cheeks went scarlet. “So… my mom was a wolf. My dad was Garou. I’m… technically a wolf. Full human intelligence, language, emotions, and very enthusiastic consent.”

The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees.

Ironclad’s face cycled through red, white, and a very concerning shade of green. “Oh my God. I’ve been committing bestiality.”

Matilda’s eyes flashed gold. “Excuse me? I am a sentient person with the exact same mental capacity and legal rights as any Homid-born. We had sex in my human form, with enthusiastic consent from both sides. Calling it bestiality is a disgusting, outdated stereotype and I am not a mindless animal.”

Ironclad clutched his desk like it was the only solid thing in the universe. “It’s still weird as hell! Why didn’t you tell me?”

“You never asked,” Matilda said, deadpan. “Also you wake up very grabby in the mornings and I happen to like that about you.”

“Please stop talking, I’m actually begging.”

Matilda’s ears drooped. She looked suddenly small. “Are you… breaking up with me?”

“No!” Ironclad blurted, then softer, “No. Just… give me five minutes to process that my girlfriend is literally a wolf.”

Cathleen lost it. She doubled over laughing so hard the coffee tray threatened to become a projectile weapon.

“Wolf-fucker!” she wheezed, tears streaming. “Certified, card-carrying wolf-fucker! I’m getting you a mug!”

Ironclad pointed a shaking metal finger. “One word outside this room and I will end you in court.”

Cathleen wiped her eyes. “Relax. It’s normal Garou culture. Homid/Lupus pairings happen. Some people are into it. I personally think it’s icky—no offense, Matilda—but I also think pineapple on pizza is a crime against nature, so my opinion is garbage.”

Matilda sniffed. “None taken. Some Homids are too squeamish.”

Ironclad looked like he was solving string theory with a hangover. “How did this even happen?”

He exhaled, steadying. “Few months ago. Patrol in Koreatown. Sabbat hit squad had me dead to rights—eight of them, claws out, the works. Then Matilda drops out of nowhere in full nine-foot Crinos and turns them into red confetti. Saved my life. I… decided not to report her. One thing led to another.” 

He gestured helplessly at the framed Red Talon alpha pelt hanging on the wall. “Still have the trophy from the pack that killed my rookies.”

Matilda’s eyes narrowed on the pelt. “That belongs to my tribe, actually. They sent me to retrieve it. Also to make sure you hadn’t tried the skinwalker ritual with it.”

Ironclad recoiled like it had personally insulted his mother. “Hell no! I’m not turning into some corrupted dancer freak!”

“Good,” Matilda said, visibly relieved. “Because you look excellent as a metal man.”

Cathleen snorted so hard coffee came out her nose.

Ironclad rubbed his temples. “The tribe calls me ‘Metal-That-Walks.’ Begrudging respect because I dropped an alpha with silver bullets. Thought it would work like the myths.”

Cathleen shrugged. “Silver causes aggravated wounds, not instant death. And we can touch it just fine in Homid.”

Ironclad looked at her, softer now. “I was an asshole in Elk Hollow. Seeing you with the pack hit every trigger. I’m sorry, Cath. You’re still you. I was just… scared for you.”

Cathleen’s smile was small but real. “Apology accepted, wolf-fucker.”

He flipped her off, but there was relief in it.

She continued, “Vincent already arm-wrestled the Commission into keeping me. Long-term play is limited cooperation—intel sharing, backup, safe houses. Baby steps toward not killing each other on sight.”

Ironclad considered. “With the Sabbat crawling all over L.A…. honestly? Not the worst idea.”

Matilda’s tail wagged under glamour. “We could patrol together!”

Ironclad pinched the bridge of his nose. “First we’re teaching you verbal warnings, proportional response, and not eating people who cut you off in traffic.”

Cathleen checked her watch. “I’ve got hormonal teenagers waiting to learn why you never taunt a Black Spiral Dancer. We good?”

Ironclad offered his hand—warm steel. “We’re good.”

She took it. “Try not to knock up your wolf girlfriend until you’ve at least read the parenting pamphlets.”

Matilda perked up. “Pups would have the cutest little metal fur—”

“NO,” Ironclad and Cathleen said in perfect unison.

Cathleen left the office cackling, the sound echoing down the hallway like victory bells.

We had a little argument and I said I don't think we're ready. We already live together and share finances so he, assured with ""we're practically already married"" proposed and I said yes.

A week later we visited our home country and we had a bug argument because I wanted to be at my mother's house for a sleepover before 8. We have previously spent 2 nights at his parents home and we agreed I would go visit my mother for a sleepover. I barely saw one friend and the rest of my family quickly for a drink at a coffee shop and a dinner. Even his mother agreed.

Also, his main family (brother sister mother and father) live close to us in the other country and we visit weekly.

Just tonight we argued about how I make everything go my way (cooking, cleaning and finances) (he sucks as all of the above honestly and he admitted to that), so I told him that things actually do go his way but it usually turns into an argument because he fails to respect the part of the deal that benefits me.

I have been thinking that were not compatible long term because of his traditional ways and my need for independent life. I am a student working part time and hope for a stable job which I love and hope to stay in one workplace for years. He has changed MULTIPLE jobs since I knew him to the point that even before it was a running gag that he switches jobs like socks. He is currently in between jobs. The money he got paid this month was enough to finally get us a savings but he spent it on a ring, I love it but I was not ready for it at all.

So what flipped me was tonight during the ""we always do it your way"" argument, he said how completely not normal it is for me to sleep elsewhere as a soon to be married woman (referring to me visiting my family). It completely sent me into a rage on the inside, I wanted to scream ""then go back to your fucking village and find yourself a damn home plant of a wife"". I didn't, in calm tone I said he's damn brave and stupid to think he can forbid me from seeing my mother (whom I don't see for months) to sit with his aunties and be quiet.

If his obedient wife wanting tendencies don't stop I don't want to stay. He pays rent even when I pay he gives it to me. He got me a 500$ car and a ring. He by all means provides. But eventually I will surpass him, my field is broad and looking for workers and I have private business options as well, and how will that life look like? A stable woman with a stable job and a man that tells her she cannot go visit family as she's ""his"" now. I need a third perspective as none of the people in my life are able to give it as obviously they either came from his or my circle of family or friends.

So here I am seeing if maybe there are groups available or maybe anyone interested in talking / getting a cup of coffee or something.

I'm 33M, and I have a few interests I'm looking to find events and groups for. I'm into spiritual stuff like reiki (im a reiki practitioner), tarot, crystals, astrology and yoga. Some hobbies include longboarding, bowling, skiing, playing the ocarina, and gaming to name a few. I just completed building my third gaming PC and would hope to meet people to also game with! I'm also into watching NFL (go Jets...sadly lol) but I definitely am supporting Darnold and the Seahawks right now

I enjoy deep conversations about STEM, the occult/spiritual stuff, existentialism and psychology. I'm quite a nerd and hoping someone can match that energy. I also enjoy traveling, I've lived in Australia and New Zealand and planning to make a trip out there next year!

  
I'm not really one to meet others on apps but have looked into meetup and some facebook and discord groups. Already have looked into TAG (tri cities area gaming) and hoping to make it to an event soon, maybe practice some DnD (have never played but want to learn!)

  
Also I'm meaning to do a lot of exploring after settling in and checking out local events, activities, and scenic areas so it'd be cool to go with someone.

I'm interested in making connections and seeing if there is a good vibe. Only looking to talk/meet those who are 21+. if interested feel free to send a chat with an introduction, just include your age, location in tri cities area, and a little about yourself

I think I'll have a better chance finding who I want using OLD as I can better filter towards ages/preferences better than organically getting chatted up or chatting someone up.

I've sent 20 photos to 5 girl mates I trust and my best guy mate. 

I have a shortlist of photos now out of the original.

I'm going to look at prompts soon but I wanted to ask you all for your tips, dos and don'ts and how I can best navigate OLD as a complete newbie.

I'm 40M, live in London, UK. Generally do well in first dates (never not had a second date) but that's probably because all of my first dates have originated in meeting organically in real life. I think if I can navigate from app to a first date I'll be fine from there.

I have a 9 year old kid and don't want to hide that fact but also make clear I'm not looking to get into a relationship so I can relinquish my parental responsibilities, I have a great time with my kid and not looking for assistance. Also don't want to get married or have more kids. 

It's fine if the other person has a kid or not. 

I'm thinking of installing Hinge, should I get whatever premium version they have since I'm a guy? I'm not planning to indiscriminately swipe as I have in mind the type of person I would like to date. 

Anything else to know? 

Is there a difference between a let's meet to check we're real people first date and a date that follows that one? What do people do for the let's see if we're real date? Coffee/bar? Or something else like a walk in a public place? Is that seen as low effort? What's the etiquette here?

He and I are quite similar, but he has changed. He fell into depression and withdrew into himself. Whenever we talked, he spoke mostly about his friends, work, games, or a TV show. He didn’t open doors for me or give compliments; the last two times I was the one who asked to go out. He refused to talk things through.

He didn’t come to my birthday, saying his brother got injured, and he didn’t ask how my birthday went (it was my 18th birthday, a big celebration). He doesn’t work on himself at all, mostly eats fast food, and has a very bad sense of style. I’m looking for what I give, and I give a lot. I have high standards, for a reason.

The only good things are that we are quite similar and that I feel really good next to him when we’re alone. When we’re in public, I feel embarrassed. He’s not even funny.

And yet I miss him again and somehow still love him, even though I don’t know how.

So, let's talk about the things that helped you keep up the positivity. 

For me it was and still is a very busy adventure. I ordered 2 dresser drawers online, love it, they deliver it right to your door, now it's time to assemble them. Then I also ordered Amaryllis bulbs online, that was an awesome decision. They come pre-potted and all you have to do is remove the lid and water it. Some of them already start to bloom, refreshing to see it during these cold times. First thing I see when slurping my morning coffee to start the day.  Then I ordered a few poinsettias, also online and decorated the entrance area, looks great. I just love online shopping, it gives me so much more time to spend with myself, instead of being stressed out at the store. Just need to make sure, one does not overdo it, hahaha. Laugh out loud.

Another thing I started long time ago, is the habit of learning something new every day, can be a small thing or a huge new chapter of learning. I discovered the philosophy of Japanese Ikigai, love it. Someone recommended it on social media, and I am grateful for that. A lot of it can be applied to people who chose the -living alone- live with useful tips and recommendation.

So, what did all of you do to keep up the spirit? ",2,1767054387.0,LivingAlone,5,1.0,False

# A Reddit commenter called our Dunkin’ obsession ‘embarrassing.’ But fans fought back: it’s cheap, it’s everywhere, and yes, we LIKE it that way.

By[ Beth Teitell](https://www.bostonglobe.com/about/staff-list/staff/beth-teitell/?p1=Article_Byline) Globe Staff,Updated December 29, 2025, 6:00 a.m.

A Reddit post where one person said our Dunkin' obsession is ""embarrassing"" sparked a lively conversation.Globe Staff/Globe staff; Handout; Jean Chung

The Reddit post was blunt — and a call for an intervention.

“The [Masshole love affair](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1pqg2x6/the_masshole_love_affair_with_dunkin_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with Dunkin is embarrassing,” it began. “Dunkin is not very good and yet we somehow have made it part of the Commonwealth’s personality.

“We have people in this very forum taking pictures of themselves with their crappy coffee or stale donuts and posting as if this so-called restaurant was a representative of our beautiful state,” it continued. “This needs to stop.”

Stop? Who does he think he’s dealing with — rational people?

“I don’t understand what people don’t understand about Dunkin’ Donuts,” read one not atypical response. “No one thinks it’s good. It’s a drug dealer. It [pushes out cheap fixes](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1pqg2x6/comment/nuuij1j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on every corner.“

“You don’t go to Dunkin because you want coffee,” another explained, “you go bc you want Dunkin.”

“These are fightin words,” a third said.

And in an undisclosed location somewhere in the Merrimack Valley, the post’s author, a Reddit user named [usernamechecksout978](https://www.reddit.com/user/Usernamechecksout978/submitted/), allowed himself a small smile.

“Some people were telling me to ‘F off,’” he said, not un-proudly.

He had been reached by phone at his mom’s house, and at his insistence, he was speaking anonymously — in part for fear of getting sued by Dunkin’ — a 47-year-old man whose wife had recently been served an allegedly under-jellied jelly doughnut.

“My wife took one bite, then two, but she still hadn’t gotten to the jelly,” the man, who teaches English and other subjects in Malaysia, told the Globe. “We thought they gave us the wrong doughnut.”

Well, that was the inciting incident, but in truth, the peeve has been building for a long time.

The Redditor has happy memories of going to Dunkin’ as a boy with his dad, but over the years, as the quality “declined,” he said, and the locals’ [obsession](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CiaBOIVtmos/?igsh=MWVnaGgwdGQxZ29oZw%3D%3D) with the chain grew, he developed an obsession of his own: why are we so bonded to Dunkin’????

Jet-lagged and stewing in the wee hours of the night, he shared his feelings with the Internet, and the Internet shared back.

“I would argue that not being a very good coffee is exactly why it’s part of our personality,” a Redditor called itsonlyastrongbuzz wrote.

“It’s objectively bad from a \[connoisseur’s\] perspective,” but “it’s cheap(er), it’s open at the ass crack of dawn and [they’re \[expletive\] everywhere](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/lifestyle/dunkin-best-location-ben-affleck/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).

“Construction worker starting a new project halfway across the state?” the user continued, “There will be a Dunks by the job site. Parent going to your kids hockey game four towns away? There will be a Dunks by the rink. Plow driver zigzagging up and down state roads putting down salt? You’ll pass a Dunks.

“It’s like the old Catholic Latin Mass,” the user concluded, “anywhere in the world whether you’re on vacation or a soldier overseas, from America to Zimbabwe, would hear the same mass.”

Redditor JoshSidekick pointed out another perk: “I’m not going to throw a good iced coffee at someone while driving,” he wrote. “Dunks lets me vent my frustration without breaking the bank.”

(Reddit being Reddit, JoshSidekick’s comment set off its own round of comments, in this case about a second major source of local pride: our feral driving. “Did you throw an ice coffee at me at the Braintree split a few years ago?” someone asked. “Maybe learn to use a turn signal next time,” another chimed in.)

Dunkin’, one Redditor pointed out, “is the connection between blue collar and white collar, Democrat and Republican, young and old. It might not be good, but it’s one of the last universal experiences pretty much everyone in the area knows. Dunkin unites this state.”

It’s a uniter in another way, too. It allows critics to fight a common enemy, the T of the sausage-egg-and-cheese world. “The coffee is passable,” a popular comment began, “but you have to admit the DDs has destroyed whatever quality was in their baked goods and sandwiches.

“It’s like the executives go down the menu every week and ask ‘How do we make this stuff worse?’”

Or maybe our whole Dunkin’ thing is just performative — a bit.

“What I love about this strange phenomenon is that it gives Massholes permission to take themselves less seriously,” Redditor ratiofarm wrote. “Because, and I say this as a transplant, this is the absolute *best* state in the country. … Drinking gas station-level joe and eating stale dessert for breakfast like it’s your identity is a flex.”

Meanwhile, in Haverhill, Massholes are having their Dunkin’ devotion tested by the — er — *bouquet* emanating from the largest Dunkin’ bakery in the entire country.

The mood seems to have been summed up by the New York Post: “Small town [overwhelmed by ‘heavy’ fried dough smell](https://nypost.com/2025/12/26/lifestyle/small-town-overwhelmed-by-heavy-fried-dough-smell-from-new-dunkin-factory-pumping-out-1-million-donuts-per-day/) from new Dunkin’ factory pumping out 1 million donuts per day,"" the Dec. 16 headline read.

And yet, one neighbor told NBC10 Boston, “I’m not sure who’s complaining about Dunkin’ Donuts. Maybe [Starbucks people.](https://youtu.be/Y_K0LXCIV90?si=eiy_n9O1bRmgXrUf)”

There’s been one City Council hearing, in December, with plans to take it up again. But maybe, no matter what happens, the truth is this:

Dunkin’, we just can’t [quit you](https://open.spotify.com/track/2PcbVKT28p9mOlWBDL371J?si=45560e26e3954663).

What can I get you today?” the young man behind the counter asks. He’s probably no older than twenty-two, his eyes still holding that hopeful gleam, like he truly believes he can change the world one morning coffee at a time.

“Chai tea, please,” I say, feeling extraordinarily happy today with the first touch of autumn hitting the air marking my second year living here-in the mortal realm.

When I first wandered in two years ago—drawn by the sugary scent wafting into the crisp air—I was lost, insecure, still trying to make sense of this world. This little shop was the first place to offer me peace. It quickly became my refuge on bad days.

“Anything else?” the barista asks.

I glance toward the glass case beside me, nibbling on my bottom lip. I’ve been trying to cut back but the thought of a chocolate pastry coated in sticky, sweet sugar is almost impossible to resist.

“Two chocolate pastries,” I say, because if I’m going to indulge, I might as well go all in. Self-control has never been my strength.

“That’ll be twelve fifty-three,” the barista says, taking my outstretched card.

 I jump, sloshing hot chai tea all over my hand but I don’t even register the pain. A soft tinkling of chimes can be heard despite the loud hustle and bustle of the coffee shop. Fear and dread flood my system as the barista holds out the brown paper bag with my pastries but I am frozen. Theres only one thing that sound could mean.

“Oh goodness! Here grab these napkins. Do you need a cold cloth?” he asks, his eyes wide with concern.

Pastries and coffee forgotten, I weave through the morning crowd slipping into the small, brightly lit bathroom. I dig through my purse until my fingers brush against cold surface of my compact mirror. Hands shaking, I unlatch the small clasp. The top part holds a mirror, the bottom part a small sharp needle. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my fraying nerves. I press my thumb onto the small needle, hissing at the pain. A bead of blood slides down the needle, pooling in the small area below. I stare at my reflection as my blood absorbs into the mirror’s surface: green eyes that always seem too large for my face, a dusting of freckles across my nose and cheeks from too many hours spent running through the fields of the Seelie Court, and a tumble of fiery red hair twisted into a loose bun at the top of my head.

The surface of the mirror ripples like a rock dropped into a still lake. I slip my thumb between my lips, the taste of copper pennies coating the tip of my tongue.

“What took you so long?” my mother asks, her voice accusing. She sits on her throne, her black diamond crown glinting from across worlds as if it taunts me with its power. It’s the same crown I was meant to wear on my wedding night—the night I ran from everything I had ever known. Her skin is pale, almost translucent like mine, black eyes gleam with cold calculation.

“I was around people,” I manage, trying to keep my voice steady.

She leans forward, lips curling “you think that matters? Orson is bleeding on my floor. Every minute you waste, he loses more.” My mother’s gaze flicks downward, a twisted sneer on her face. A man sits at her feet, his body curled over itself, bruises painting his pale skin in cruel shades of purple and blue. His once blonde shoulder length curls stained and matted with blood.

“What did you do?” I demand, my voice nearly as hard and unyielding as hers.

“I did nothing,” she says, emphasizing the I. “Atticus.” She states.

“Why would Atticus do this?” I ask, not quite believing he could have done something so vile to someone I care about.

“It seems the prince has grown tired of waiting for his darkness to return.”

“I am not his,” I say, my voice trembling with the quiet wrath building inside me at the mention of his name.

“You are,” she replies coolly. “And you’ve had your fun. It’s time to come home.”

“And if I don’t?” I ask, though I already dread the answer.

“Then whoever he takes next won’t make it back to my side. And if your thinking of refusing, I don’t think the prince will be so understanding about your little human pet, Jason isn’t it?.”

A chill races down my spine “You’ve been watching me,” I say, my voice low.

“You are heir to the Unseelie Court. If you thought I’d let you run off without protection, then you’re stupider than I thought.”

The mirror goes dark. I stare at my reflection, heart hammering, panic clawing at my chest.

I’m being called home which might as well have been a prison. My shackles might be made of jewels instead of iron, but they’ll be just as effective.

But, I feel like I’ve only met 4 women in my lifetime who are my age and fit the I want in a wife (2 were foreign college students studying abroad, 1 taken, 1 I dated but came to find out that her and I just did not have anything in common other than our faiths.)
Here’s a list I’ve made but I wonder if I’m asking for too much:

Red flags (bad): 
Watches horror movies (not counting suspense films like Psycho or other older films. Modern ones are just demonic), Obsessed with sports (I don’t enjoy watching other people play sports on TV), does Witchcraft, Finds nothing wrong with Harry Potter, Drinks alcohol, Does Drugs, Smokes, Smokes Weed, Obsessed with dogs to the point that she values them over people. Finds nothing wrong with Tattoos biblically (I am fine if they got tattoos before they were saved), Obsessed with Halloween (satan’s holiday and celebrated by satanic worshipers), Obsessed with Disney to the point that it’s like her religion, Dresses immodestly, Liberal or moderate political beliefs. Supports abortion (1/3 of Gen Z is missing), Has kids (exception from if it was a result from being assaulted. In that case, I’m fine with that), Divorced (unless her ex-husband was unfaithful to her.) Has a nose ring like cattle or hogs. Is a Partier.
Irrational, Toxic, Does not care about the truth. Will compromise on speaking the truth to avoid offending people.
Bases judgments on feelings without looking for evidence. Makes judgments by purely hypothetical scenarios without caring about reality.
Spends a fortune on daily coffee from coffee shops (on occasion like once a week is fine. And I like coffee)
Is willing to boycott companies when they do morally evil or unethical things.
Overweight to the point that she restricts me from being active from doing things like biking or skiing. (I learned how restrictive life is when dating someone over 300 lbs. and I like doing activities like hiking, snow skiing, and walking around in public places)
Supports LGBTQ which is clearly defined throughout the Bible as a sin. Supports illegal imagination, (I do support legal imagination)
Does not believe in spanking as discipline
Is not against the evil Muslim faith. (But loves the Muslim people wishing for them to be saved and find Christ)
Hates America, Believes in Horoscopes, wears crystals or evil eyes. 
Obsessed with a celebrity in a way that is beyond just wanting to see them live in a concert. Listens to mostly rap or just country music. Has an onlyfans (I can’t believe I have to list this) Would place an iPad in front of kids to shut them up. Big Swiftie (there is demonic imagery throughout her concerts)
Sends n*des to other guys (can’t believe I have to list this when trying to date Christians). Cheats (again, I can’t believe I have to list this)

Not deal breakers: (neutral. Either or)
Didn’t wait for marriage previously *but will wait for marriage with me.
Has a past but been faithful in her faith for a few years
Was divorced due an unfaithful spouse caught in adultery or was abusive to her. That is a form of divorce that I do not disagree with, and it’s biblical.

Green flags: (good)
Loving, Caring, loves God and will love God over her husband, Sense of humor, Enjoys hobbies and actually enjoys doing things.
At least Somewhat active
Is capable of looking at things logically rather than purely off of feelings
Pro life, Conservative 
Has a solid understanding of the bible 
Good with kids,
Likes watching movies
Might enjoy story focused video games with me on occasion.
Wants to pray with each other, (I’ve never dated someone who is willing to do this when I ask)
Will eventually be vulnerable in prayer together
Will one day be vulnerable and understand that I am forgiving of her falling short so long as she is honest about her mistakes rather than lying and hiding her mistakes while continuing to repeat them.
Wants to read the bible together (I’ve tried so many times to set up a date with many women and I have gotten turned down every time)


Am I asking for too much?
I feel like my grandparents were able to find someone like this so easily!
Most of the older women at the churches I’ve been to all fit what I want, but it feels near impossible to find a woman my age (I’m 24) who has the qualities that I want.

I am 24, never been married, and have been a Christian since I was 9. I went to college at a Christian university for my bachelor’s degree and graduated with honors.
I am an Information Systems Management Specialist. 
I also am easy going and able to tolerate a lot, and people are often shocked by how much I can tolerate being treated horribly by others while still showing kindness to them. I don’t cuss, and I love being a servant to others helping them. Often volunteering to help others. I am very good at helping elderly people and even good with people who have dementia. I have good communication skills and people often ask me to be the one to confront people who are hard to deal with as I can usually put people in a good mood despite frustrating circumstances.

My issues: 
I’ve been told my friends that I don’t care enough about myself and I am quick to help others, but don’t love myself enough.
I give people the benefit of the doubt too often.
I’m not naïve, but I give people too many chances sometimes and they take advantage of my generosity.
I can be a bit clingy emotionally. And try not to be obsessive when I care for someone.
I struggle to take breaks from work when I have things that are unfinished as I think about them when I’m off work.

Chapter One: The Sky’s Lure

The sky had always lied.

Not in the way a con man lies—slick, deliberate—but with the seduction of a dream that gleams too brightly to question. From childhood, he’d looked up and believed it was his destiny to conquer the stars.

Now, at sixty-four, sitting in a vast steel-and-glass sanctum orbiting the Earth, Elon knew the truth.

He wasn’t going to Mars.

It wasn’t the rocket fuel or the engineering. Those were always solvable problems. No, the real blockade was humanity itself. He had spent decades trying to bend nature to his will, to outrun the entropy of Earth. He had tried to launch humanity forward on the tip of a Falcon’s flame. But people, it turned out, didn’t scale. They broke, they scattered, they lost interest. They needed air and food and affection. And they died.

He leaned back in his chair—high-backed, carbon-fiber, absurdly overengineered—watching a slow blue curve of Earth rotate across the viewport. A storm churned over the South Pacific like cream in coffee.

Beneath him, the planet he’d tried to escape spun on. He felt it now not as something to transcend but as something he had abandoned.

The mission—Project Aether—had been delayed. Again. A solar flare had knocked out three drones on the Martian test surface. The colony prototype—more PR fantasy than science—was in tatters. The latest crew return capsule was scheduled to dock at Nova Station in twenty-two hours. They were coming back early, again.

“Psychological strain,” the report said. Elon had read between the lines: loneliness, fear, grief. People weren’t meant for red deserts and titanium bunkers. Not yet.

He exhaled.

His mind flicked backward—uninvited—to Talulah’s voice, sharp and brittle over a call from years ago.

“You’ve built a world no one can live in, Elon. Not even you.”

She had been crying. He remembered only the silence afterward, and the sense that some wire inside him—vital, tender—had been severed.

The hum of the station deepened. Machines whispered around him, always working. Unlike people. Unlike himself.

His assistant, a polished but irritating AI named Lucent, pinged into his ear.

“Mr. Musk, would you like the updated resource matrix for Terraforming Phase Four?”

“No.”

“Would you like a cognitive modulation suite to reduce prefrontal strain?”

“No.”

He stood and walked toward the observation deck.

Earth gleamed in radiant stillness. Cities were just glimmers. There was no sign of the billion fires his industries had lit, no echo of the women he’d left, the children he had tried to mold into soldiers of purpose. Grimes’ face drifted into his memory like vapor. She had said once, in her strange poetic way, that he was trying to become a god because he didn’t know how to be a man.

He hadn’t understood then. He did now.

Something inside him was shifting.

Not all at once.

Not like ignition.

But like soil cracking, letting the seed breathe.

He tapped the console beside the viewport and pulled up a live feed from Cape Canaveral. There was no launch today—just a pale sky, gulls wheeling, salt air thick with heat.

Below, the world lived. Flawed, chaotic, burning—and alive.

Elon Musk, the man who had once sold the planet a dream of ascension, now felt the slow gravity of Earth drawing him home.

And for the first time in a long, long while, he let it.",2,1767054060.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False

I’m not asking about market trends or polish yet just whether the ideas themselves feel compelling and make you want to know more.

Here are the concepts, very briefly:

1. Butterflies (2nd draft done)

A coming-of-age story about two teenage friends navigating the end of high school, isolation, unwanted change, and an unspoken emotional bond, set against the disappearance of their younger siblings on the hands of a mysterious man. The story unfolds sort of slowly, focusing on small moments, intimacy, and loss, ending in tragedy that permanently reshapes how one of them sees the world.

Themes: youth, transformation, unspoken love, memory.

2. Love Story (Working Title)

In a small town during fall, a 20-year-old man unsure about his future spends his days writing in a coffee shop. He meets a girl caring for her sick mother, and they slowly fall into a quiet, intimate relationship built on conversation and shared ideas. Their connection pushes him to confront his fear of moving forward. Years later, after becoming a writer, they reunite briefly — not to be together, but to recognize what that love helped them become.

Themes: timing, insecurity, becoming, letting go.

3. Married Couple (working title was a school assignment for a 10 min play)

A married couple struggles to survive the aftermath of losing their young daughter in a car accident caused by the father. He returns to work as a high-school career counselor, helping students imagine futures while barely believing in his own. Through small connections and daily routines, the couple slowly learns how to live with the loss — not fixing everything, but accepting that healing is possible.

Themes: grief, guilt, marriage, endurance.

4. Father & Son (working title)

A financially struggling father works himself sick to keep his son in college. When the father becomes seriously ill and can no longer work, the son drops out to support him. As they grow closer for the first time, the son turns to illegal work to pay medical bills. Just as the father receives a life-saving transplant, the son is killed as a consequence of those choices — leaving behind proof that love sometimes survives only through sacrifice.

Themes: sacrifice, systems, family, consequence.

5. El Escorpión (Trilogy Concept, the most ambitious for once I have more experience writing)

A political crime trilogy set in Mexico. A young man discovers his powerful, respected father is secretly the head of a criminal organization controlling the region. In trying to dismantle the corruption, the son kills his father and unintentionally becomes the new leader. Across three films, he rises from reluctant heir to feared ruler to elected governor, ultimately questioning whether destroying a corrupt system from the inside only turns you into what you hate.

Themes: power, inheritance, corruption, destiny.

I 3D printed one of the adjustable zero scale collars and zeroed the scale. I was surprised I had to increase the diameter slightly on the 3D model found on MakerWorld to make it fit the neck and wondered if maybe they changed the diameter slightly. 

With the DF54 zeroed, I first set the grind to 20 and the puck practically choked my espresso machine. I then went to 27 and that was an acceptable shot. I am grinding an espresso blend from a local coffee shop. The roast is medium dark to dark and the beans are oily. 

I am curious if anyone else has a recent DF54 with the red titanium burrs (normal espresso/general purpose ones). The DF54 I received has the new V4 (1.4) chute. I pre-ordered it from Espresso Outlet expecting a mid February delivery, but it arrived a week later. I had been reading past posts about starting points for espresso, and most seem to be set below 20. I was curious if the new red titanium burrs are now falling in the above 20 range for espresso or if I have an anomaly.

I kind of gave her a look she goes have you ever been tested? Then I said no.
I’m 54 years old and have quite a bit of life experiences for someone raised on a farm and very little travel.  Used to be a realtor that was extremely good at researching for off market properties
And I started a nonprofit and filed my own paperwork for Tax Exempt 501 C3 status and was approved the first try.

Her comment was, you seem to be extremely intelligent but also  “ nervous”
Where most of the employees sit down and relax I do not. I am almost always on the go.   
I don’t think I would perform well on a standard IQ test.  My husband is very smart in a different way. His is more math and statistics.
Mine tends to be more science, art, and and an insatiable desire to learn multiple subjects. I pick up on reading people much better than I can books.
Although my comprehension has always been very good, my reading ability is not. 

Is there an IQ test for people that naturally think outside the box and have a hard time thinking inside the box? 
And also when left to see a broad picture, will solve three or four different Things but needs to put the different solutions on paper to hold it as an anchor to connect the other elements?

example
I run a nonprofit, 
That will have 3 working projects under it.
Project A would be a K-12 grade charter school for the gifted.
Project B is a full working hotel 
Project C is a large  organic regenerative Homestead using Permaculture practices.
All three have their own unique mission, but they all work in unison
Projects B&C will be the campus that project  A the charter school will utilize as part of its curriculum.

The best way I can describe all this is think of a watch that you can see the individual gears moving in.
The nonprofit is the watch
The gears are projects A B and C

So my question again is there an IQ test for someone like me that does not do well with pattern recognition the way my husband does?

**The chess match ended in an unforeseen way. The White Queen was close to cornering the enemy, supported by a female siege tower, two male knights, and a female pawn that transformed into another Queen. But even so, the enemy defenses covered their sovereign. However, in a risky move, the female bishop attacked and checkmated the Black Queen who usurped the throne.**


**With no moves left to save herself, her final fall began. Her executioner, a man with a familiar face and a blood bond but lacking paternal love, dragged her toward the pit of misery that the Queen always tried to avoid. Meanwhile, the White King remained safe in the background, dealing with his own problems to solve.**

**The Yokohama night remains in a state of almost magical tranquility; the streets near the Yamadas' inn are shrouded in a peaceful silence, something Kazuya's home in Tokyo rarely offers. The atmosphere is seasoned with the light sea breeze blowing from the bay, carrying the scent of salt and the subtle aroma of rose season from nearby gardens. Everything seemed to come together to set the perfect stage for the spiritual release that an ordinary Tokyo city dweller so desperately needs.**


**Kazuya wipes the tears from his face and lies back down on his futon. Looking toward the ceiling, with a mixture of melancholy and shyness, he began to speak.**


Kazuya: I don't even know where to start, these days have been very difficult, everything has been chaos and nothing I see or hear makes sense to me. A few days ago I had an accident, I don't know what happened or how or when it was, but it was strong enough to make me lose the memory of more than two years. I feel like I'm living in a dream and that I have to find a way out. Everything is confusion, I don't know how to distinguish what is true and what is not, I'm a pathetic man, right? I could have died or ended up worse and yet I still complain about my good luck.


**Mrs. Yamada listens and is deeply surprised, takes a breath to process it and, with a calm voice marked by experience, answers him clearly.**


Mrs. Yamada: ""Kazuya-san, don't punish yourself like that. It's true it could have been worse, but what happened to you is also difficult. Now I understand things better; you are running away from your past, right? I am no one to tell you what to do, but, in my opinion, you should try to put the pieces together. Some will be painful, but others will be so happy they will be worth it. Even if everything were sad, that is better than knowing nothing. In the end, your past doesn't define who you are today, nor does it tie you to a future, but it does make it more memorable to see how you got here.""


**Kazuya looks at the lady for a moment and continues with a more desperate and confused voice.**


Kazuya: ""Thank you, I appreciate your words, but what should I do? Where do I start? That actress... are we really that close? How did someone like me manage to do it? How is it possible that I produced a movie? It's unreal, I've never even been chosen as a team leader even in school! Did I fulfill her dream? How? I haven't even been able to introduce a girlfriend to my grandmother in my entire life, I don't understand it. That's not me. How can I remember something if I can't even believe what they say?""


**Mrs. Yamada looks at and listens to him, she feels his words and feels sadness for him; but he doesn't need comfort, he needs to know he is wrong, so she responds immediately, interrupting Kazuya.**


Mrs. Yamada: ""Young man, enough. Stop thinking that way about yourself, eliminate that idea. Tell me something, were you born knowing how to speak and walk as a baby? No, right? You learned from your mistakes and grew until you achieved it, didn't you? This is the same; the fact that two years ago you were incapable of doing things like that only means that something happened that motivated you to work and grow to achieve them. Besides, the evidence is there, on video and in the words of those who were with you. Do you understand? I won't let you underestimate yourself like that in my presence; no one knows what they are capable of until they try.""


**Kazuya feels a strange sensation of warmth in his chest upon hearing her words, something he thought he had lost when he decided to leave Tokyo; with a slightly calmer tone, he answered.**


Kazuya: ""That... it's true, you're right, thank you for helping me see it... But what do I do with my feelings? According to this actress, I loved her, but... what about the girlfriend I want to be with now? Is it really false, what I feel for her? Besides, this actress also told me in the hospital that she had rejected my love, and then, she confesses to me right before I leave Tokyo? How can that make sense? What do I do? Everything is very confusing, I don't know what to do, I don't know how to go on, I don't know who to believe...""


**Kazuya enters a state of agitation and keeps speaking, pouring out all his doubts and fears.**


Kazuya: ""Besides, why does my grandmother apologize to me in the hospital, but the next day she hides the truth of the news from me? Why? Were her apologies not sincere? Then, that girl, Sumi... she could barely speak when I met her in the hospital a few days ago, and now it turns out she gives a national interview as if it were the most normal thing in the world! And besides she says I'm someone admirable... What? And apart from her there are two other girls who are also friendly with me? When did this happen? According to me, a week ago I only had my girlfriend and I had never had a real friendship with any girl... What is happening?""


**Kazuya remembers one last thing that has also kept him doubting and feeling guilty, finishing his intervention and remaining without energy or breath to continue.**


Kazuya: ""And on top of everything, there remains something even more illogical... Now it turns out my girlfriend is the bad one? Was it she who invented a whole story like that just to hurt others? Impossible... She has always seemed like an angel to me, she is so kind and good... She bought me this cell phone before coming here, she gave me money and, even so, everyone is against her? Even I have doubted her. What a horrible man I can be.""


**The lady feels an immense confusion at not understanding anything he says, but she understands that he is too confused, so she centers him on a single path.**


Mrs. Yamada: ""Kazuya-san, the truth is I understood almost nothing, but hearing you and understanding how there are things that contradict each other, just let me give you a piece of advice: follow your heart, but also your reason. Use both to understand why they said what they said, and if you still have doubts, ask the person directly: 'Why did you say this before and this now?'. Let them explain it to you, and you just pay close attention; only then will you be able to know if something is truth or a lie.""


**Kazuya listens carefully while relaxing as he breathes over and over; then he answers with more calm.**


Kazuya: ""I apologize, I got carried away and let everything out without explaining anything, it's just that... I think I needed to get it out of me. Thank you very much for your support, what you tell me makes sense, it's that simple. I just should have spoken more before interpreting things, you're right, but... now what can I do? I said cruel things to that actress and I left my grandmother before speaking. Do I have the right to speak to them again? I have no idea how to fix everything, I was impulsive...""


**Mrs. Yamada looks at him and with a direct and clear voice speaks.**


Mrs. Yamada: ""Of course. She is your grandmother, and is the other girl a friend of years? I don't know them, but from what they've said on television, I'm sure they want to fix things. You just need to take the step and they will listen to you, and you must do the same for them. Even if it hurts, or doesn't end well, you must do it if you want to move forward. I'll give you one final piece of advice: if you don't have the strength to face them now, try to do it with someone else. You must have someone trustworthy to talk to, as it seems you are a great boy. Try it, I know you can.""


**Kazuya thinks: ""Someone else?"". And the first person that appears in his mind is Mini, something that surprises him, but quickly becomes more logical.**


Kazuya: ""I thank you very much for everything; for listening to me, for supporting me and for giving me these valuable pieces of advice. I think I was able to get it all out and release some stress; now I feel better and I think I already know where to start. I won't take up more of your time, I don't want to be a nuisance for you or your husband. I'm sorry to have forced you to stay with me, but also thank you for doing it, it was a great help. I think... I will contact someone now.""


**Mrs. Yamada finally answers with a more animated and closer voice than before.**


Mrs. Yamada: ""Don't worry about that, it was a pleasure to talk to such a kind boy. I'm very glad it was helpful to you and I hope things go well for you. Although we've finished for today, you can always come whenever you want if you have any questions; it's lucky to have you around here, you make me feel as if my son were home again. Take care, and another day we'll keep talking more... It's incredible that I can be part of this love drama with that famous actress who has given me so many hours of entertainment!""


Kazuya: ""Yamada-san... this is serious, please, hahaha... Thank you very much for everything. Take care and see you tomorrow.""


**Mrs. Yamada left the room and Kazuya fell back, totally exhausted, on his futon, thinking while looking out the window with the night sky in the background.**


Kazuya (Thought): ""Why did I think of that crazy girl first? I don't think she's a bad person, but with the little I heard of her, she seems like a walking time bomb with several screws loose, hahaha... she seems like the typical modern girl who makes videos or does cosplays... Ahhh... but who am I to criticize her? I'm no one to judge. I'm a terrible person, I must stop thinking like that... Wait a second, why does it seem so easy for me to talk about this girl like that?...""


**Kazuya plunged into a rough sea of thoughts for the next few minutes, planning his next steps to dispel his doubts. The night accompanied him faithfully, without interrupting him, until he managed to make a decision. The years lost in his memory would no longer be an obstacle he had to avoid; it was time to face them without fear.**


---


**While Kazuya began to gain courage after a moment of deep reflection, in Tokyo multiple events of equivalent intensity were unfolding, but, at the same time, different. On one battlefront, Mini Yaemori had finished broadcasting a live stream that would be of great help to her favorite pair of lovebirds; however, Ruka's final and unexpected attack toward Mami turned this victory into a bittersweet and dangerous experience.**


**Just when Mini was preparing to block the video to avoid further problems, a message from Kazuya surprised her and distracted her from her immediate goal, leaving the video active on the internet.**


**After her surprise and her initial suspicions about the authenticity of these messages, Mini accepted having a call with the person from the unknown number, trusting that it would be Kazuya who would be on the other side of the line. As soon as her cell phone started ringing, Mini slid her finger across the screen and answered.**


**The call began, but an awkward silence settled in without either of them speaking. Only a second had passed, but it felt eternal; however, Kazuya was the one who broke that silence and spoke.**


Kazuya: ""Yaemori-san? Are you there? Sorry for calling you at this hour, Kuri gave me your number and my original cell phone is in repair, according to what my father said before I left. I know this sounds sudden, but can you give me a few minutes of your time to listen to me? I won't take up much of your time""


**Mini was surprised to hear his voice; it was him. His attitude was very different, but, without any doubt, it was Kazuya. With overflowing emotion, she replied:**


Mini: ""Mastah! It really is you! For a moment I had my doubts, but it's true... How silly of me!, since Kuri told me everything! And who is that? Call me Mini. 'Yaemori' is only for school and strangers; hearing you call me that makes me feel there's a wall between us... And enough with the formalities, speak with confidence. I'll listen to you as much as you want; I don't mind being here until the end of time if necessary""


**Kazuya was impressed, but also somewhat irritated by the screams coming from the speaker. He took a breath and spoke again.**


Kazuya: ""I'll try, but I don't promise anything, Yaemori... Mini-san. And what is that 'Mastah' thing? Never mind, I'm not interested now, but let me be clear and honest with you: avoid saying unnecessary things or this isn't going to work. Forgive me if I'm too rude, but I just want to ask you something quick; I could have done it by message, but I decided it was better this way. Have I been clear? Yaemori... I'm sorry, Mini-san""


**Mini listened to him carefully and felt a pain in her chest, an instinctive sadness; but she understood she had to calm down or she might lose that small connection that made him call her in the first place.**


Mini: ""It's okay, M... Kazuya, I understand perfectly. Don't worry, tell me everything you want, I'm listening.""


**Kazuya noticed the immediate change in the girl's tone, something that made him feel somewhat guilty, but he decided he could apologize when finishing.**


Kazuya: ""All right... Kuri mentioned to me that you were the one who had the most information about my relationship with Ichinose-san, that's why I contacted you. I want to know more details; specifically, I want you to tell me about those moments you consider most important. But not right now. I want to go to Tokyo and see my mother, could you help me with that? I don't want to see anyone else... Besides, before that, I want us to meet a few hours before. What do you say, Mini-san?""


**Mini listened attentively. And although she understood the logic of why he referred to Chizuru as ""Ichinose-san"" so easily, instead of the usual emotional ""Mizuhara,"" she couldn't help but feel strange; she knew that was her real last name and not the rental one, but even so it was a detail that made her feel melancholy.**


**However, she didn't have time to think about it too much, as it was her turn to speak.**


Mini: ""Of course, leave it to me. I'll inform your mom of everything myself. What day and time do you have in mind? And about our meeting, I'll do everything possible to be free on the day you need. I hope I can help you, but... why don't you go directly to speak with Chizuru-san?... I'm sorry.""


**Mini became upset upon realizing her mistake in mentioning the latter; she simply apologized, thinking about how silly she was to put one more unnecessary pressure on Kazuya, and stopped speaking. Kazuya, on the other hand, responded immediately.**


Kazuya: ""Don't apologize, I understand. I really thought about doing it, but in the end I decided it was too early for me. I don't want to see her until I know more; I really don't want to say something else that hurts her. I already did enough before leaving... But, returning to the subject, can you do the day after tomorrow in the afternoon? I need to prepare myself. Maybe at 3:00 p.m. What do you think? Can you?""


**Mini listens and recognizes her kind ""Mastah"" a bit more; he's there, he's just scared. She doesn't know exactly what he refers to by saying he hurt her, since Chizuru didn't say much about that meeting. She avoids deviating from the subject, thinks about her schedule for the day and answers.**


Mini: ""I'm available from 12:00 p.m., but I don't mind if it's at 3:00 p.m. I'll be ready at whatever time you say. But, what time do you want to see your mom?""


**Kazuya thinks for a few moments and answers.**


Kazuya: ""Mmm... I'll see my mother at 5:00 p.m., since that's when she used to change shifts with my grandmother, or at least that was two years ago... And about us, to have enough time, how about 2:00 p.m.? Look for a place you consider is important for me and send me the location. Shall we agree on the details by message, Mini-san?""


**Mini understands everything and, with a more animated tone, answers him, only to apologize afterward.**


Mini: ""Sure! 2:00 p.m. is perfect. Leave it all to me, the incredible Mini Yaemori will fulfill her mission... Er... sorry, I got carried away...""


**Kazuya hears the changes in tone with great clarity and proceeds to apologize for his aggressiveness as he had planned.**


Kazuya: ""Mini-san... It's okay, calm down. Forgive me for being so rude, it's not my intention to make you pretend to be someone you aren't; I just want you to contain yourself a little... I don't need more than that. I just want to remember or hear more about my past without any distraction for now.""


**The call continued for a few seconds: a simple exchange of mutual friendly support vows and a slightly more friendly and light farewell. The first step was done; Kazuya had managed to advance a little more toward his main objective. Mini, in contrast, was very happy for that call, so short, but which slowly opened a path toward the return of her ""Mastah"".**


**However, that great emotion she felt, added to the hope of a better future, made her completely forget to manage the live stream video. She didn't delete it or hide it, allowing Ruka's words to remain on the network. Something that would act as a double-edged sword for her cause: it would end almost any trace of suspicion toward her friends by having a guilty party, but they would gain a dangerous enemy who will have no mercy on anyone.**

***Tuesday, May 24. Nanami Residence, Tokyo, 10:33 p.m. JST.***


**While the city of Tokyo began to quiet down under the mantle of an increasingly dark and cold night. And after a few hours after Ruka's revelation and a few minutes after Mami's descent to purgatory, a man remained standing in front of the window that looked onto the balcony of his room.**


**Isao Nanami continued with his response plan, leaving his beautiful wife on the floor below suffering in loneliness among tears, alongside a daughter who remained fast asleep from the effect of the sedative.**


**Isao was on a call with his personal assistant, someone of his complete trust; someone who showed total obedience to his requests. Suddenly, Isao began to speak after listening for almost a minute to the man on the other end of the line.*""


Isao: ""Perfect. Efficient as always, Sakamoto; I like hearing this. I'll leave you to continue with the plan in detail. You have access to all the resources you need for this extra work. Remember to be completely discreet and ensure that no one from the team is going to betray us. If you see it as necessary, use any means at your disposal.""


Sakamoto: ""Don't worry, Isao-sama. Let me take charge; I give you my word that I won't let you down. As my father always told me: 'dirty laundry is washed at home'. The lawyer has the order to have the documents ready tomorrow; the logistics team is working on cleaning the Nanami surname from the networks using multiple accounts, and the blocking of the channel is already a fact.""


Isao: ""Good. I want you to work all the hours necessary on this assignment until it's finished. Tell them I will give them an additional payment for their commitment, and those who oppose will simply be out of the group.""


Sakamoto: ""Understood. Tomorrow morning at the office, we will meet with the lawyer to initiate legal action, prioritizing the girl who dared to mess with your family. And, of course, we will have the information on the other targets ready as well.""


Isao: ""Excellent. Also, notify my driver that tomorrow he must arrive two hours earlier than usual; he has to pick up my daughter to take her to Nagano with the Hakubas. Tell him I will be generous with the extra pay; he only has to perform the transfer without asking or commenting on anything regarding it.""


Sakamoto: ""Perfect, noted. As soon as we finish this call, I will dial him immediately until he accepts. I believe that is all for today, or is there anything else I can help you with, Isao-sama?""


Isao: ""No, this is enough for now. Tomorrow, with the lawyer's documents and the information from the private investigation you hired, I will evaluate what our next step will be.""


Sakamoto: ""Understood. Then I will leave you so you can rest peacefully. I will take care of everything, as always. It is a pleasure to hear from you and to be at your service. Thank you and until tomorrow.""


**The call ended in a mechanical and empty fashion; there was nothing more to talk about, only what was strictly necessary to ensure a correct result. Isao lowered his cell phone and remained looking out toward the city, where the glass of the window, along with the faint light of the moon, caused his tense face and his gaze devoid of any emotion to be reflected.**


**The silence in the room became absolute; only the tiny sound of the hand of his wristwatch could be heard. Isao remained pensive for a few more seconds until, with a deep sigh, he turned and prepared to lie down on his bed to rest and prepare for the following day. All while his wife and daughter still remained in the living room, submerged in a deep darkness. The night had ended. A new day was about to begin.**


---


***Wednesday, May 25. Saizeriya Restaurant Nishiguchi L Tower, Tokyo, 09:55 a. m. JST***


**A new day. The sun illuminates the city again and colors the sky a pale blue, accompanied by some shy clouds that beautify the landscape without blocking the view of the king star. The weather remains temperate and the wind is calm with a refreshing current.**


**Inside a fairly crowded local restaurant, Chizuru remains voluntarily isolated in a hidden corner, far from the entrance. She wears dark glasses and the typical hairstyle of her alter ego ""Ichinose"", that mask of a reserved and studious girl she wore at her university.**


**Sitting in her seat and with her hot coffee in one hand, she felt how a great nervousness increased with every minute that passed. After taking a slow sip of coffee, she thought:**


Chizuru (Thought): ""I trust Omata-san and his judgment, but even so I cannot lower my guard. I hope it's not a trap. I accepted only because of the mention of that lost object Omata mentioned this girl had. I have her photo; I should be able to recognize her easily if everything is real, but I must stay alert.""


**Chizuru heard a strange noise beside her and turned quickly, but it was only a mischievous child hitting one of the tables a few meters away. Chizuru thought again:**


Chizuru (Thought): ""Calm down! Nothing is happening. I've faced worse things, this cannot make me lose control like this... I hope this serves for something; I don't want to waste time with something insignificant. I already delayed my visit to the hospital with Sumi and her father for this; it has to be something that is worth it. And what happened with Mini? She said she had something important to tell me about Ruka-chan when I saw her at the hospital with Sumi, what could it be? Ahhh, I'm exhausted... When will I have some peace?"".


**Chizuru released her breath in an almost inaudible sigh, trying to recompose her posture. No knew what that object was; the uncertainty would not let her be at peace and her anxiety was only increasing.**


**Suddenly, a girl in a school uniform appeared in front of her. Chizuru, submerged in her thoughts, did not see her coming and gave a small jump out of surprise upon hearing her speak.**


Girl in uniform: ""Good morning, Ichinose-san. I see you've come. My father got me this opportunity to meet you thanks to his friendship with Omata-san. What do you say, shall we begin? By the way, my apologies, let me introduce myself: my name is Yuzuki Nakamura, it's a pleasure to meet you. I hope we get along well"".


**The girl sat in front of her and, without wasting time, took out a strip of Purikura photos with the name of the place: TDC (Tokyo Dome Center). She slid it over the table toward Chizuru, who was left speechless at the enormous surprise and the vivid memory she experienced in just a few seconds.**


Yuzuki: ""Well, I think that reaction says it all. Shall we talk? I have many questions to ask you. Don't worry, I have no reason to do anything bad to you; just listen to me and let me confirm some things"".


**The encounter was explosive, but silent. There was no great spectacle, but the new girl had managed to touch Chizuru's heart with a single move. Both remained staring fixedly at each other; neither wanted to yield control. It was an internal battle in which Yuzuki was starting off winning with a wide lead. The sound of the people around was insignificant compared to Chizuru's internal screams and Yuzuki's challenging gaze.**


---


**The night came to an end and the sun emerged illuminating everything again, starting a new day. Hidden in the shadows of this morning, a new enemy prepares a master plan to reach his goals, while no one within the ""White Army"" can foresee what is to come. The Black Queen who usurped the throne fell, but the King, even darker, has returned to take command of his kingdom. Everything was clear: he had to clean his territory of all those annoying white pieces that hurt his eyes.**


---


We have finally returned with the continuation! Between the holidays and other occupations, it had not been possible for me to finish the chapter; I apologize for the delay. Without going on longer, this was a chapter full of tension that presents the contrast of two different futures clashing with each other: a reunion between Mini and Kazuya that brings hope, and a disturbing talk that bodes an inevitable danger.


Mami has ceased to be a threat, but her father has replaced her, and he knows no moral limits. Things will be stirred up again; new conflicts and resolutions have been fixed in time.


That has been all for this time. Thank you very much for reading and see you in the next chapter! Look forward to it with anticipation!


What did you think of the chapter?


How severe will the attack planned by Isao Nanami be?


What is it that Yuzuki seeks with Chizuru?


**Comment and vote, that helps me know if you like it. I will be reading the comments. That is all for this time, see you next chapter. Thank you for reading my story, see you soon!**

1pz2t4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1pz2t4l/idk_why_my_friend_cut_me_off_opinions_needed/,Idk why my friend cut me off. Opinions needed.,"I’m going to give as much objective detail as I can but ultimately this is my version of the story. I’m not sure what her narrative is. 

My (32f) friend (29f) and I have been friends for almost 10 years. We have never had any issues or arguments. We are both easy to get along with and have had a great friendship. I’ve never fought with or had issues with any of my friends. 

2 years ago I got a job that I relocated for but wanted to rent out my house instead of sell it. My friend was getting ready to move out of her parents’ house and expressed interest in renting the house. I was nervous to rent to a stranger and she was nervous to be on her own for the first time so we both discussed and thought this would be a good experience for both of us. 

We signed a lease and discussed the ins and outs of how this would be handled. I only charged her enough to cover the mortgage and didn’t charge a security deposit. It was a good deal for both of us and it was going great. I took care of anything that went wrong which wasn’t much and she took good care of the place. 

A year in, she was let go from her job. I told her to let me know if she needed anything and she reassured me that she would be fine on rent. She drug her feet (in my opinion) on applying to jobs which upset me because she works in a very lucrative field where it’s easy to get a job even in today’s market. But I didn’t say anything because I get it’s a stressful experience. 

6 months later her unemployment ran out and she still didn’t have a job but took a part time job in retail. She asked me to cut rent in half for a few months until she could get back on her feet financially. I agreed and told her I never wanted money to get in the way of our friendship but I already was charging her just the mortgage so I’d be going into my own pockets to do this and couldn’t do that beyond 3 months. She agreed. 

As a side note, her dad recommended she sell her car because she was paying an $800 a month car payment and they had an extra car she could have that would be free but she refused. 

We checked in about this 2 months later and she let me know she wouldn’t be able to make the rent past the next month and would need to move out. I completely understood and appreciated her letting me know. I felt sad for her because I know that’s frustrating to have to move back in with her parents. We agreed September would be her final month and I would cut rent in half for her again. 

Suddenly mid August rolled around and she told me she was going to be out by the end of August. I had just listed the place for rent and was confident I could get a new tenant by October when she was supposed to be out. I was not confident I could find someone on 2 weeks notice plus have time to clean/paint/etc. 

I offered to help her move. She declined. She texted me telling me she shut off the utilities and would be out that weekend. I was extremely frustrated because I’d have to start paying for the everything after I already had been so patient and flexible with her. I told her I would still need the half September rent unless I found someone sooner to move in (our lease was formally signed through November) and I would appreciate if she could just keep the utilities in her name so I didn’t have to pay a “start service” fee just to change it in a month. 

She told me she wasn’t paying for something she wasn’t using and she didn’t appreciate my tone in that text. She told me to “put myself in her shoes” and didn’t I realize how hard this was for her. I apologized for my tone and expressed that I was frustrated and I certainly understood she was stressed which is why I’ve been willing to be flexible and go into my own pockets for her. 

She left things (dining room set, boxes, bar stools, shelving units) in the house. She told me she didn’t have a way to move it. I told her I also didn’t have a way to move it so I was going to sell it unless she wanted to sell it. She said no. 

We saw each other a few weeks later for coffee and it was stiff to say the least. Neither of us mentioned the house but she shared she was going on vacation with a friend who we usually hangout with and she clearly didn’t invite me. After that, she didn’t invite me to her birthday. She removed me on some socials and hasn’t said a word to me since. 

What’s your take? What’s her narrative? I feel like I did everything I could to preserve the friendship and it hurts that she cut me off. I feel taken advantage of. I lost a friend and a lot of money. ",1,1767053580.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

# Beyond the Buzz: What Makes a Coffee Company Stand Out?

In a world saturated with coffee shops on every corner, simply brewing a decent cup isn't enough anymore. Today's successful coffee companies are masters of more than just roasting beans; they're building communities, championing sustainability, and crafting unique experiences that keep customers coming back for more.

The best coffee companies understand their audience deeply. They know whether their customers crave a quick, expertly brewed espresso on the go, a cozy corner for remote work, or a place to gather with friends. This insight drives everything from menu development and store design to marketing campaigns and customer service.

*   **Ethical Sourcing:** Transparency in where beans come from and fair treatment of farmers is increasingly important to consumers.
*   **Community Engagement:** Many successful chains go beyond serving coffee, hosting local events, showcasing art, or partnering with neighborhood charities.
*   **Unique Offerings:** From innovative brewing methods and seasonal drinks to distinctive pastry selections, offering something novel sets a brand apart.

Discover your next favorite coffee experience by exploring brands that prioritize quality, community, and conscience.

I want to rant a little about my last group of friends, my current friends and my longest friend. This is gonna be long af, I apologize in advance.

1. The group I had until 3 or 4 years ago I met while studying in another city. When we finished, we all came back to our homes. I suggested to hang out on discord at least. Everytime I would do that: crickets. But they only wanted to hang out on a rental house on New Year's Eve. In total, I would have to spend more than 300$ to be there. I never showed up, they new I was unemployed. By the third year, I flee from the group. It's not normal to have to spend that much money to be able to see your friends.

2. I know the adult life is a busy one, but the two remaining friends I have on my city never hang out with me. One of them has two jobs, so I completely understand, but the other one is a freelance artist. I know she was to work too, but it's impossible to hang out, I only ask her out once every two months. ?? You can't see me over some coffee? Not even lunch? We don't even text, she never answers more than one line to anything. Dunno man, even my friends that live abroad and come home from the holidays make time for me despite their jobs.

3. My current best friend is my online friend I had for almost over more than 10 years. We've seen each other just once, but we practically speak everyday through text. I know a lot of men are raised to not talk about other emotions that aren't anger, but I wouldn't mind an 'I love you' from time to time. I always have to take it out from him, I need my sweet words too, I'm human. I know that not all love is verbal and he can't give me quality time (again, he's my online friend), but come on, some words? A tiny surprise gift? I wish he gave me something without me asking. I always tell him that I love him, but sometimes I get mad and I just don't fully open my heart to him, I don't want to gift my words away.

Since then, the most asked question I have gotten is “how did you manage to get the offer?”. 
Figured that I would write a more detailed post about it. 

My cofounder and I started building in April and we live in NYC. In May, both of us went back home to Stockholm for the summer (we were lucky to be in a position to work remotely for 3 months). 

We figured that it would be a great time to expand our network and get a foot into the European startup scene. Not only for raising capital in the future, but also for potentially hiring talent.

Given the recent increase of unicorns in Stockholm, there was a lot of interest from both investors but also entrepreneurs to partake and expand the startup scene. Lots of enthusiasm (and FOMO) around companies like Lovable, Legors, Klarna, VOI, etc.

This favored us. Given that we grew up in Stockholm, it was not difficult to find someone that could introduce us to other founders/investors, and invite us to relevant events.

We spent the first month having lunch / coffee with investors and founders, while attending events. This allowed us to practice ”pitching” and get advice from experienced investors (like the first investors in Klarna) but also experienced founders (multiple exits, YC founders, and more).

Keep in mind that we never had the intention of raising money. We only wanted to get a foot in the door, learn as much as possible, and practice explaining our product. Might have been a bit naive, but at the time, learning was the most important thing for us as first time founders.

Somewhere along the way, this network of investors we talked to seemed to have spread the message of our idea and our background. I think this is important to note: on paper, one can argue that my cofounder and I look great: 25 y/o, M.S. degrees from Ivy League universities, and we worked as team leads for Series A-C startups within Quant Research and SWE. I don’t really care about the degrees but it seems like investors do. 

Anyway, fast forward a couple of months and this early stage VC fund called us and said ”you guys should come into the office so we can spend some time talking about your product”. We said yes as we saw it as an amazing opportunity to practice pitching for investors (we did not have a pitch deck or anything but a prototype to show). 

We had two meetings with them that week. And then they offered us $100,000 for 10% in order to help us build more momentum. At the time, neither of us were working full-time on the startup, so the idea was to use the capital to help us quit our full-time jobs.
We ended up saying no much later, but I covered that in another post.

So that was really it. We tried to expand our network and learn as much as possible by putting ourselves out there. And it paid dividends. And if there is anything I have learned from this is that you just have to show up and try. We had no idea what we were doing, nor what we were talking about (and we still don’t lol). But we approached everything with optimism and an open mind.

Now the product is in a much better stage with real users getting real value! Might be time to raise in 2026 as we have some very compliance heavy features we want launch and a much better understanding of our target market!

1pz2kza,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1pz2kza/mitchum_internship_theory/,Mitchum Internship Theory,"I’m not here to debate whether You think Mitchum was right or wrong, but rather put some pieces together for a potential theory behind Mitchum’s actions. 

We all know, He gives Rory that internship as an apology for dinner(as He puts it). There are theories it was never an apology, He had ulterior motives, etc.. BUT what if We take all of Mitchums words as truth, with a twist. Think Emily-She can be very honest with Her opinions but there is usually a reason behind Her ways of delivery. 

I want to preface this by saying, I really don’t think Mitchum had anything personal against Rory. Main evidence: the woman He married is not from “their world”. BUT She is useful to Him and therefore it didnt matter where She came from as long as She had value to the family. 

We know grandpa was against Rory, including Shira, for either Her mother’s reputation in society or truly Rory’s working ambitions. Regardless, to those two, Rory posed no value as They had very specific idea of what type of woman should be with the heir. Obviously, Shira was able to fit the mold-and not restrict Mitchum in the process while He is doing who knows what. She is what was expected of Him, except She could also be controlled by the family. 

However, I do think Mitchum wanted to test Rory before making His decision. The whole reason He had Her shadow HIM and not work directly with the intern department at the paper doing normal assistant intern stuff, is because a potential marriage agreement doesn’t need an assistant l- it needs someone who can take charge and actually take care of the business(wether rich wifely duties, or potential newspaper talent scouted/ groomed early to bring on into the fold). 

The biggest argument I see against Mitchums actions is hiring a first time intern from college and not training Her, then giving Her a mean review based on no direction. HOWEVER, She was there to shadow THE boss, which most interns wouldn’t be doing in almost any case + most rich kids who grew up in that world would not need the directions when They get the direct “shadow the boss” internship. They understand They are there to observe, ask questions, network and pitch ideas. Not sort through documents no one else wants to do or fetch coffee. They are there to learn how to be a boss in the future. While Rory may not have understood that with Her background, and as usual, was underprepared for an important opportunity no one taught Her about so She went along with what She knew best; She was given an opportunity to do Her best in front of a newspaper mogul and Her best was to assist Him-not show Her personality/ideas/knowledge.  

That’s the big reason why His feedback wasn’t directed towards Her writing, but rather Her personality. She wasn’t “Huntzburger” material because She didn’t take risks and was accommodating instead of ruthless. And I think THATS what She doesn’t have. He puts it as guts, drive- all needed to be successful in the whole industry, let alone the journalistic career. He wasn’t observing Her “work ethic”, He was observing Her potential in benefiting Him and the family. Outside of that, He doesn’t care about Her as a person and She is just one of the many. 

UNTIL She calls Him at the hospital with Logan there, and She has GUTS. I think the respect grew there. And the elevator scene after Logan graduation confirmed that He started to warm up to Her by explaining himself. He didn’t have to, He could’ve blown it off, but He wanted to make sure Rory’s aware of His reasoning and He is not standing in their path. 

It all becomes clear at Logan’s birthday where Mitchum says “circumstances change”: She provided value to the family itself in His eyes, and therefore She is welcome in His world. The world where it’s all quid pro quo. 

I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. I typically took it more at face value with understanding there is no realistic reason for Mitchum to lie and scheme-he’s not retired or a stay at home wife. But He started reminding Me of Emily and how She communicates blatantly, but in different ways to push the narrative Her way. ",9,1767053013.0,GilmoreGirls,5,0.91,False

Before I start apologies for my English and grammar . English is not my first language so take in mind 😂.

I’m trying to make sense of something that’s been happening with a coworker that I’ve been working with for 2 years at the start he’d always praise me , now and only recently started working in the same project recently in the same area . Recently he wouldn’t leave me alone. He keeps coming into my office area , asking if I wanted coffee on zoom message work . I didn’t reply, but he brought one anyway. He also kept asking when my meetings would end, tried to pass my office area when I was speaking with a customer, and gave me a smile while looking at me but I didn’t smile back.

Sometimes he’d open my office door and talk to me, lingers thru . But when I invite him to work with me in a bigger area, barely comes. Prior to this he opened up about a personal matter . And shortly after I went to check on him and to let him know I’m all ears basically.

when it’s just the two of us, he behaves this way hovering, smiling, bringing snacks, lingering, even making long eye contact. But when certain  other coworkers are around, he acts completely different he acts like I don’t exist, he doesn’t notice me and treats everyone else like that expect from those certain coworkers .

There are times where I’ve given him the silent treatment after he acts different around certain other colleagues, but then he’d smile at me and start a conversation then ask me to go on a work breakfast break with him when they’ve left , but when they are around he’d go on breakfast breaks with them I wouldn’t include or ask me to join , the others normally do but not him. And there’s other time I’d keep my distance then when those certain co workers aren’t around he’d always come looking for me or would message to ask where I am etc .

He has my number but barely texts me outside of work unless it’s work related. Or he’d check on me when he’s at work and I’m not . I’m currently on holiday and have been for 2 weeks now and he hasn’t messaged me by my number

He doesn’t message me outside of work , I guess my question is what are his intentions and does he have a crush on me? Is he expecting me to chase him ?",1,1767052965.0,LifeAdvice,0,1.0,False
1pz2j9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1pz2j9f/how_to_win_at_life_the_ultimate_science_based/,How to WIN at Life: The Ultimate Science Based Guide to Leveling Up,"So you have probably heard this ""life is a simulation"" thing floating around the internet. Maybe from Elon Musk. Maybe from some philosophical rabbit hole at 3 AM. But here's what nobody's really breaking down for you: life operates EXACTLY like a video game, and once you understand the mechanics, you can actually start winning instead of just button-mashing through existence.

I have spent months diving into research from behavioral psychology, game theory, neuroscience podcasts, and yeah, content from people like Dan Koe who have cracked this code. This isn't some Matrix escaping fantasy. This is about understanding the system so you can level up deliberately. Let's break it down.

\## **Step 1: Accept You Are Playing Whether You Like It Or Not**

First harsh truth. You didn't choose to spawn into this game called life, but you're here now, and the game is running. The question isn't ""how do I escape?"" It's ""how do I play better?""

Every video game has core mechanics. Life's mechanics? Energy management, skill trees, resource allocation, and quest completion. Just like in RPGs, you have limited time and energy (your daily stamina bar), you need to build skills to unlock new areas, and you've got to complete tasks to progress.

The people crushing it in life? They've figured out the game mechanics. They're not smarter or luckier. They just understand how the systems work.

\## **Step 2: Your Character Stats Are Real (And You're Neglecting Them)**

In every game, your character has stats. Strength, intelligence, charisma, endurance. Real life? Same deal. You've got physical health, mental clarity, emotional resilience, social capital, and financial resources.

Most people are running around with a level 3 character trying to beat level 50 bosses. Then they wonder why everything feels impossible.

Start tracking your actual stats:

\* Physical: How's your energy? Sleep? Nutrition? Exercise?

\* Mental: Can you focus for 2 hours straight? Are you learning new skills?

\* Emotional: Can you handle rejection, failure, setbacks without collapsing?

\* Social: Do you have real relationships or just Instagram followers?

\* Financial: Are you gaining resources or bleeding them on useless consumables?

James Clear's Atomic Habits breaks this down perfectly. Clear won multiple awards for this book, and it's basically the player's manual for leveling up your character stats through small, compound improvements. The core concept? You don't need massive changes. You need 1% improvements daily. That's how you go from a weak starter character toan endgame boss. This book will genuinely change how you see progress. Insanely practical.

\## **Step 3: Choose Your Class (Or Stay A Generic NPC Forever)**

In video games, you choose a class. Warrior, mage, rogue. Each has different skill trees and playstyles. Real life? You need to pick your lane, too.

The people who win aren't generalists trying to be everything. They specialize. They pick a class (entrepreneur, creator, engineer, athlete, artist) and max out those specific skill trees.

Cal Newport talks about this in So Good They Can't Ignore You. Newport's a Georgetown professor who's spent years researching career success and skill development. His argument destroys the ""follow your passion"" myth. Instead, he shows that passion follows mastery. You become passionate about things you're exceptionally good at. The book lays out exactly how to build ""career capital"" by developing rare and valuable skills. This is your class selection guide.

\## **Step 4: Complete Side Quests (They're Not Distractions, They're EXP)**

Here's where most people mess up. They think only the ""main quest"" matters (career, money, status). But in every great game, side quests give you experience, resources, and skills you need for the main storyline.

**Real-life side quests:**

\* Reading books outside your field

\* Learning to cook well

\* Building genuine friendships

\* Developing a creative outlet

\* Improving your communication skills

\* Getting therapy or coaching

These feel like distractions, but they're EXP farms. They level you up in ways that compound later.

Use an app like Finch to gamify your daily habits and side quests. It's a self-care app that turns real-life tasks into game mechanics. You have a little bird companion that grows as you complete tasks like journaling, exercising, or learning something new. It's surprisingly effective at making mundane tasks feel like actual progress bars filling up.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns knowledge sources like books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it pulls from millions of high-quality sources to create content tailored to your goals. You type what you want to learn, whether it's social skills or productivity strategies, and it generates custom episodes. 

You control the depth, too, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The voice options are legitimately addictive; there's a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, or sarcastic and energetic styles depending on your mood. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime to ask questions mid-podcast or get book recommendations. Perfect for commutes or gym sessions when you want to level up without staring at a screen.

\## **Step 5: The Resource Management Game (Money, Time, Energy)**

Every game has resources you manage. Mana, gold, and inventory space. Life's resources are time, energy, attention, and money.

Most people are terrible at resource management. They spend time like it's infinite (it's not). They waste energy on low-value activities. They let their attention get hijacked by algorithms designed to drain it.

Time blocking is your inventory management system. Cal Newport also covers this in Deep Work, where he explains how the ability to focus without distraction is becoming the most valuable skill in the economy. People who can do deep, concentrated work for extended periods are leveling up faster than everyone else who's constantly context-switching.

The Pomodoro Technique is your stamina management tool. Work in focused 25-minute sprints, take 5-minute breaks. Your brain has limited focus stamina. Respect it.

\## **Step 6: Boss Fights Are Mandatory (And They Should Scare You)**

In games, you can't progress without beating bosses. They're supposed to be hard. That's the point. Real life? Your boss's fights are:

\* Starting that business

\* Having that difficult conversation

\* Quitting that soul-crushing job

\* Ending that toxic relationship

\* Putting your work out there for judgment

If you're comfortable all the time, you're not fighting any bosses. You're just grinding low-level mobs forever. No boss fights means no progression to new areas.

Check out Andrew Huberman's podcast episodes on stress and performance. Huberman's a Stanford neuroscientist who breaks down the biology of discomfort and growth. His episode on dopamine management is game-changing. He explains how your brain's reward circuits work and why easy dopamine (scrolling, junk food, Netflix) makes real challenges feel impossible. Understanding this is like reading the game's source code.

\## **Step 7: Other Players Are Part Of Your Guild (Stop Solo Grinding)**

MMOs teach you this quickly. Solo play has a ceiling. You need a guild, a team, a party. People who amplify your abilities and cover your weaknesses.

Most people try to solo grind through life. It's slow, lonely, and inefficient. Your network is literally your net worth, but more than that, it's your support system, your accountability structure, your idea generation machine.

Join communities around your interests. Not just online, but real humans you can grab coffee with. Use apps like Meetup or local groups. This isn't networking BS. This is finding your actual party members.

\## **Step 8: The Meta Changes (Adapt Or Get Left Behind)**

In competitive games, there's a ""meta, the current most effective strategies. The meta always changes with patches and updates. Players who can't adapt get left behind.

Life's meta changes, too. The skills that worked 20 years ago (stable corporate job, pension, retirement) don't work now. The meta now? Digital skills, personal branding, multiple income streams, and continuous learning.

Staying stuck in an old meta is how you become irrelevant. Read trend reports, consume content from people ahead of you, and experiment with new platforms and tools.

Ali Abdaal's YouTube channel breaks down modern productivity and learning meta perfectly. He's a doctor turned creator who teaches evidence-based productivity. His stuff on active recall and spaced repetition will upgrade your learning speed dramatically.

\## **Step 9: Respawn Points Exist (Failure Isn't Permanent)**

Here's the good news. Unlike actual video games, you get unlimited respawns in life. Failed business? Respawn. Bad relationship? Respawn. Career disaster? Respawn.

The people winning aren't the ones who never fail. They're the ones who fail fast, learn, and respawn better. Each failure is just data for your next run.

\## **TL;DR**

Life runs on game mechanics. Track your character stats. Pick your class and specialize. Complete side quests for EXP. Manage your resources ruthlessly. Fight boss battles to unlock new levels. Build your guild. Adapt to meta changes. And remember, you get unlimited respawns, so stop being scared to play.",1,1767052896.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False
1pz2izz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pz2izz,I'm exhausted and spiraling,"TL;DR - friend has been spiritually harassing me and/or trying to save my eternal soul. This is a very 'out of character' post for me. 

____

This has been going on for a few years now. I never fully cut this friend out because I do care about him. I tried setting up a coffee with him for a Sunday and at the last minute he tweaked the plans so he could only see me if I go to his church. I told him I only want a regular coffee connection but he's so persistent and it feels very manipulative. I'm at the point now where I'm so tired and triggered with these breaches of boundaries that my mental health is out of sorts and I'm even wondering if I'm justified anymore. I deal with bipolar disorder and religious psychosis was a prominent feature of my disease. I find myself wondering if this is God using him to bring me back in now. And I know that's not true but my emotional state has my critical thinking weak and the intrusive thoughts are loud. 

For those that may wonder why I've let it go on this long. I don't know. I'm still grieving the loss of my once very consuming spiritual life and it's been a long process of building an identity outside Christianity. I'm just still hard at work healing every day. I browse religious subs a lot as a form of exposure for myself but when it's someone I know and loved, it's too strong to manage in one go.

I've also been processing with ChatGPT and the spicy thoughts now have me wondering if that's just a tool of the devil trying to convince me to set more boundaries. I'm in a bad way. Don't know what or who to trust and honestly your responses are probably going to be passed through a version of that 'mistrust' filter.

I don't know if I'm looking for help or validation or strength or what. But I just wanted to post this to see if anyone has been here before and how they disarmed those internal threat sensors. ",18,1767052879.0,exchristian,10,0.92,False

PLEASE DO NOT SHARE IN OTHER PLATFORMS. 

Hi everyone. It’s me again. So last time, naging okay pa kami. Nag-usap lang and I brought up sa kanya na nagalit ako about the picture he posted sa my day nya. Hindi naman naging ok ang lahat kasi may hinanakit pa ako pero atleast, parang cool lang kami. 

I just want to share something now kasi ang bigat na. Last December 19, my partner told me na pupunta sya sa city para mag benta ng phone nya. And I asked him WHY? Sabi nya, kasi wala daw kaming pambayad sa due namin the next day & kailangan nya magbigay ng 5k sa nanay nya. 

So sabi ko, bakit walang budget for the bills? Diba may sweldo ka? Sabi nya, naubos daw. So tinanong ko sya kung san napunta sweldo nya & yung 13th month nya.

He told me he received 120k as 13th month last December 5. Sa 120k na to, binigay nya saken yung 22k. 8k pinambayad nya sa tito nya. 15k sa credit card. 6k grocery. around 10k sa mga bata. Then 25k binigay nya sa nanay nya. Sa 25k na yun, 15k yung budget para sa death anniv ng tatay nya, then yung 10k allowance nila sa bahay. So all in all, mga 86k yung nabawas. So sana may around 30k pa syang natira sa 13th month nya. 

Last December 15, he received 52k as salary. He told me na nagbayad sya ulit ng 15k sa credit card, 8k sa mga yaya, 7k sa isang loan, at 5k para sa additional allowance ng nanay nya. So dapat meron din syang roughly 17k na natira dito. PERO WALA NA. NAUBOS NA TO LAHAT.

So ayun, nagsabi sya na ibebenta nya daw cp nya sa city and syempre hindi ako pumayag. Pag binenta nya, ano gagamitin nya? Diba? Sabi ko, bibili nalang ako ng voucher para mabayaran yung bills. Saka nag message naman sya sa boss nya kung pwede na i-release yung sweldo sa sideline kaso hindi nakapag reply. So sa isip ko, baka naman maibalik agad yung pera if mabigay na yung extra income sa sideline nya. So ayon, nabayaran ko na nga yung bills.

Last December 21, hindi padin nakapag reply yung boss nya so worried na sya. Hanggang December 22, need na namin bumyahe pauwi sa kanila. WALA SYANG PERA. Ibebenta nya padin sana phone nya this time pero pinigilan ko lang tutal nabayaran ko naman na yung due namin last December 20. So syempre, pera ko na naman yung ginamit pauwi sa kanila.

As much as I don’t want to help him, hindi ko lang talaga kaya i process na need nya pa magbenta ng phone para lang makauwi. Sobrang galit ako pero tinatago ko lang. Alam nya naman na uuwi kami sa kanila December 22, hindi manlang sya nag laan ng budget. Sa family nya naman yun na event.

Anyway, so diba nagbigay sya 15k budget sa nanay nya? I also know na yung isang relative nya nagbigay din ng 15k as extra budget para sa death anniversary ng tatay nya. Yung relative nyang to used to stay with them nong bata pa sila & sila yung tumulong sa kanya hanggang nakapag abroad kaya galante magbigay sa kanila. So meaning, 30k na yung total budget for the death anniversary. Pero guess what? Umutang pa yung nanay nya ng extra money sa tito ng partner ko. Kasi kulang daw yung budget. Pano ba naman kasi hindi kukulang???? Eh 2 weeks before the event, pinakatay na ng nanay nya yung baboy at binenta sa mga tao, pinautang nya. Tapos yung para sa event, naka freezer lang. I mean, hindi kukulangin yung 30k kung ako lang. Sobra sobra na nga yan sana. Saka Dec 24 sila naghanda kaya hindi naman masyadong madami yung bisita kasi may kanya kanyang handaan din. And yeah, as I have expected, ang daming baboy yung hindi na luto. Ang daming mga manok yung natengga. I mean, hindi naman masasayang kasi pwede naman lutuin, pero bakit kasi bumili ng sobra sobra? Hindi naman kelangan mag hoard. Diba? Ang daming pagkain yung nasayang, yung palabok nilangaw nga lang eh. 

So anyway, last December 23 dumating na yung sahod ko. So may budget na ako. Supposedly, after event, bale pagka December 25 pupunta kaming Siquijor, kasi yung family ko andon. So since wala syang pera, akin naman yung gagamitin. December 24 evening, nag contact ako sa ticketing and they told me na walang byahe yung roro December 25 (this is fake news btw pero ok na din) so that night, sinabihan ko sya na instead of going to Siquijor, uuwi nalang kami. So we went home. Sumama samin yung nanay nya, dalawa nyang kapatid at isang pinsan nya.

Habang pauwi, I’m really worried kasi baka wala kaming dadatnan na kuryente sa bahay, HINDI PA NABAYARAN. Luckily, pagka dating namin meron pa kaya pinabayaran ko kaagad kinabukasan. OF COURSE, WITH MY MONEY. 😂

My salary is 60k. Alam nyo kung san napunta to? Pinangbayad lang sa bills. Right now, wala nang natira saken.

So last December 26, I told him magpapa nails ako para ma treat ko naman yung self ko. So hinatid & sinundo nya ako. Papunta, dinala nya yung isang anak namin at isa nyang kapatid so hindi kami nakapag usap. But nong nasa nail tech ako, I gathered all the strength that I have para mag kumpronta sa kanya. I was really nice. I gave him the list of expenses during the Manila trip, the list kung san napunta yung 22k na binigay nya, EVERYTHING. I told him na baka starting February, pwede nya na ako bigyan ng fixed amount na budget for utilities, grocery, etc. I told him na okay lang naman saken mag bigay sya sa family nya as long as hindi kami naco-compromised dito. I told him na hindi naman ako pakialamera sa pera nya pero may family na din naman sya, and sana i prioritize nya din yung bayarin dito sa bahay. Last November, hindi din nakapagbayad ng kuryente kaya ako ulit gumawa ng paraan. Muntikan din kaming maputulan non.

So I was very calm when I messaged him. But yung nakuha kong reply is cold as fuck.
- “Hihiram ako ng sasakyan mamaya, punta akong city para mabawasan ko yung hiram ko sayo”. 
- “Bayaran kita mamaya. Next year bayaran ulit kita”

I told him, hindi naman ako naghihingi o nagdedemand ng payment. I just told him na pag due na ng cards, magpapa help nalang ako sa pagbayad. Pero wow. Nong sinundo na nya ako from the nail tech, dinala nya din yung kapatid nya so hindi din kami nakapag-usap. Pagdating sa bahay, nag prepare lng sya at umalis.

This time, sumabog na talaga ako. Sabi ko 50/50 nalang kami saka after new year pwede na syang umuwi sa kanila, dalhin nya pamilya nya. PAGOD NA PAGOD NA PAGOD NA PAGOD NA PAGOD na akong umintindi. This is my very first time na mag kumpronta sa kanya about money pero minasama nya pa. Ang laki nga ng sweldo nya, pero kahit simple bills dito sa bahay hindi mabayaran. Sino ba naman hindi magagalit? 

Sya nagpapa-aral sa dalawa nyang kapatid. Yung isa gumraduate na last June, hanggang ngayon wala pading trabaho. Nag La Salle pa yan sya. Wala manlang initiative na maghanap ng trabaho. Hanggang ngayon palamunin padin. Yung isa naman naka stop for 1 year kasi di sila kaya pagsabayin. At sabi mag apply na sa public schools ayaw din. One time, sabi ko mag transfer ka nalang dito then enroll ka sa school ko (public), alam nyo ba kung anong una nyang tanong? “Private or public?” Grabe, ako na nahiya. So yung plan sa isa nya pang kapatid ay pag-aralin din sa La Salle. Para tatlo sila sa La Salle. Okay naman sana to kung may budget. Pero wala eh. Kargo nya lahat. So ano yun? Uunahin nya yung kapatid nya pero wala syang ambag sa therapy ng anak namin? Wala namang trabaho yung nanay nya. Pinapa dalhan lang sila allowance every month. AFAIK, 15k budget nila don every month. Minsan kulang pa yan. Naghihiram pa nga nanay nya saken. Pano hindi kukulangin eh pinag scatter lang yung pera. SO SINO HINDI MAPAPAGOD NYAN DIBA? 

Last December 28, we went to the beach. Kasi pambawi sa mga hindi nakapunta sa Siquijor. It was just us, yung mag cousins. 15 kami in total including yung partner ko, 2 nyang kapatid at yung pinsan nya. Syempre dinala padin sila, ayoko naman maging super rude na wag sila imbitahin. Especially, hindi aware pamilya ko sa nangyayari. So we booked 2 rooms na good for 10 pax in total tapos tents. Kasi 2 rooms nalang bakante so wala na kami choice. Alam nyo ba, yung mga kapatid at pinsan nya pa yung nauna mag occupy ng room. Ang ending, kami sa tent. Hindi ko naman sinasabi na yung tent ay intended sa kanila, pero pagka dating na pagkadating don sa resort nag settle sila kaagad sa room, nakatulog pa kapatid nya. Ok lang naman kaso wow, yung cousin ko na ka share sa expenses, na evict pa don sa room na yun kasi full na daw sila sa room. Kusa nalang nag transfer sa tent pagka gabi. Haha

Nong nag inuman na, yung cousin ko tinanong nya partner ko kung kelan kami magpapakasal. Linakasan ko talaga loob ko, sabi ko “wag na kayong umasa”. Wala akong pake kung naririnig ng mga kapatid nya. Mas mabuti na ngang marinig nila. Hindi ako nag enjoy sa trip na yun, stressed na stressed ako. It really gotten to the point na pag makita ko pamilya nya, umiinit ang ulo ko. Close naman kami before pero hindi ko maiwasan ngayon. I think I need to see a doctor. Hindi ko sila kayang tingan sa mata. Everytime I see them, sumasama loob ko.

So fast forward, after sa beach, lahat dumiretso dito sa bahay including yung cousins ko. One of my cousins mentioned na nag apply sya as working student sa isang coffee shop. I really took the chance na mag discuss about it baka lang naman maka hint sa kapatid nya. So my cousin is just 2nd year college, both parents are engineer. She doesn’t need to work, she just wants to earn. Mabuti pa yung bata, may gana pa maghanap ng trabahon. Tong mga kapatid nya, palamunin lang. Wala nang ginawa kundi mag mobile legends at mag date sa syota. Haaaay. 

Last night, nag party pa sila dito pero hindi na ako nag join kasi wala akong gana. Kahapon pagdating dito, problemado yung partner ko. Tutok lng sya sa phone. From 4pm pagdating until mga 8pm, naka phone lang sya. Mukhang seryoso. Tapos may time pa na naglalaro kami ng mga bata dito sa room and grabe yung tawa ng mga bata tapos nag play sya ng music. I don’t know baka trip nya lang. Pero by looking at it, I think may problema sya. Natulog ako early, pagka gising ko around 1AM nasa phone pa sya, until 2-3AM siguro. 

I know that he is worried kasi baka wala na syang makukuhang sweldo this end of the month. Then yung start nya sa isang company is moved so wala din syang sweldo on January 15. Pagka January 30 pa sya ma sweldohan and yung final pay nya sa company nya ngayon if by February pa siguro, 1 month after clearance. So I told him na wala naman syang masisisi. He already anticipated this. He should’ve prioritized us. Now I heard his family is staying here until February kasi wala syang budget na maipapadala don until January 30. So sino bubuhay sa pamilya nya? Ako?

Guys, pagod na ako. Gusto ko na silang umalis. Kahit ako na magbigay ng budget nila don, umalis lang sila. Pagod na pagod na pagod na pagod na ako. Wala akong peace of mind dito mismo sa loob ng bahay ko. Gusto ko silang umalis. O ako yung aalis. I contacted my friend in the US baka sakali ma tulungan nya ako mag process, I am a licensed teacher. Pagod na pagod na ako. Lagi sumasakit ulo ko. Everytime maalala ko to, umiiyak ako. Hindi ko na alam gagawin. I just want them to leave or I’ll leave. Hindi ko lang alam pano mag move forward from all of these. I just know I am very tired.

1pz2ee1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pz2ee1,Idea for cool sticker project!,"I had this idea for a sticker collage on a wall-> I always see cool tattoos from books or movies that I like but I am not a huge tattoo person and I know I will regret most of them. So, my idea is to hang a piece of acrylic (like the ones people use for clear calendars on a wall but much bigger) and over time I will turn it into a sticker collage with stickers from movies, places I’ve visited, and things that are special to me. I could just put the stickers on the wall but I like the idea of it being portable if I move living spaces. I think it would look great in a bathroom where the acrylic is almost as big as the wall is. I will make the stickers, buy them, and collect them. Now I am deciding whether I should make it into a timeline somehow. I’ve started a Pinterest board of sticker ideas and there are already 5000 pins lol!

1pz2e8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditStoriesYT/comments/1pz2e8m/my_ex_came_back/,My Ex came back,"I found out my ex was out of jail because he liked one of my old photos at 2:14 a.m.
No message. No follow request. Just a notification that shouldn’t have been possible, from an account I thought I’d blocked everywhere. For a second, I convinced myself it was a glitch. Social media does that sometimes. But my hands were already shaking before I even opened the app.
By morning, the feeling hadn’t gone away. It sat heavy in my chest, like I’d skipped a step on the stairs and my body was still bracing for the fall. I checked my surroundings more than usual. Locked my car twice. Looked over my shoulder for no real reason, then hated myself for having one.
By the next day, I’d seen his car twice.
Once parked across the street from a coffee place I used to go to. Once slowly passing by my old apartment complex, not even trying to be subtle. When I told myself I was overreacting, mutual friends filled in the gaps for me. He was “doing better.” He was “just trying to apologize.” He was “looking for closure.”
But he never asked if I wanted any of that.
He didn’t reach out directly. He didn’t respect the distance. He hovered around the edges of my life, circling old routines, old habits, old versions of me—like if he retraced the past closely enough, I’d be there waiting.
I wasn’t.
I had changed my schedule, my favorite places, even the way I dressed without realizing it. I’d grown quieter about my life online. More careful. More selective. He wasn’t looking for who I was now—he was chasing the person he used to control.
The scariest part wasn’t that he came back.
It was how normal he acted about it. Like time had softened everything. Like jail was just a pause button and not a consequence. Like the fear, the boundaries, the silence were things I should’ve grown out of by now.
He smiled in photos. Laughed with friends. Told people he was “starting fresh.” And somehow, that version of him expected access to me again—as if my absence had been temporary, as if I owed him forgiveness just for surviving.
I didn’t confront him. I didn’t explain myself. I didn’t give him the reaction he might’ve been waiting for.
I just made sure I was harder to find.
Because the past doesn’t stay buried on its own—you have to stop it from digging its way back.",1,1767052568.0,RedditStoriesYT,0,1.0,False

0347 — Initial Contact

0347 hours: I answered on the first ring. Protocol: identify, verify, triage. My voice is practiced and neutral.

“911, what is your emergency?”

A shallow intake of breath. The vocal timbre was constricted, as if the caller were speaking through a pillow. Response lagged, two beats.

“Someone’s here,” she said. No name, no apartment number, only the apartment complex name I recognized from prior reports.

I executed procedure: request location, request immediate hazard status, assign preliminary priority. Fingers on the console; my CAD fields filled as I spoke.

“Ma’am, can you confirm your address?”

She provided a street name and a unit number that didn’t match our most recent occupancy files. I flagged it as unverified. I dispatched Unit 14 as closest available — ETA ten minutes — and elevated to Supervisor Harrow.

Her voice dropped. “He’s at the door,” she whispered.

There was an audible scrape on the audio channel, slow and deliberate. I noted it verbatim in the log. I asked if she could secure a safe room, if the subject was outside or inside, whether there were weapons. The answers were fragments. She kept repeating, “No face. Shadow.” Then the line went dead.

I initiated callback protocol. The line registered as disconnected at 0349 hours. No voicemail. No cellular tower handoff that explained the disconnect.

0352 — Follow-Up & Field Response

0352 hours: I attempted callback three times. No ring. No pickup.

0358 hours: Unit 14 on scene. Dispatch received an overhead: unit reports residence appears occupied but secured from the inside; no visible sign of breach. Officer requested forensic clearance. I cleared additional units and marked the call open pending follow-up.

0403 hours: Unit 14 advised building clear. Interior disturbance noted—chair displaced, lamp tilted—no sign of occupant. Forensic enroute. I annotated the case file with the phrase the caller used: “no face, shadow.”

0417 hours: Forensics advised negative on fingerprints, no trace DNA collected, no shoe prints, no forced entry. I logged the forensics outcome with the caveat: evidence inconclusive; follow-up recommended if missing person report is filed.

Throughout the initial four-hour window, I maintained a professional tone on the radio, routing resources, adjusting priorities, coordinating with code enforcement regarding property records. The file curved into a standard procedural arc: unverified location, potential transient, probable psychosis recommended in field notes.


---

0600 — Morning Review

0600 hours: Supervisor briefing. We reviewed audio. The human channel contains distress and breath noise consistent with panic. Engineering applied a spectral clean. The cleaned audio still displayed an underlayer—sub-audible harmonics under the frequency band of normal speech.

Engineering labeled the underlayer an artifact; in my log I annotated possible interference / re-check if repeated. Human audio alone suggested a plausible domestic disturbance. Protocol closed for lack of corroborating evidence.

I preserved a clean copy on a portable drive for potential future analysis. I do this routinely; retention of potentially anomalous media is part of the job.

At this stage my writing and my voice remain methodical. Categorical. Operational.

Two Weeks — Pattern Recognition

Two weeks of similar calls appears on the docket:

— 18 MAR / 0201 / Call: adolescent reports porch light toggling in sync with scraping. Electronics team finds no malfunction.
— 23 MAR / 0350 / Call: multiple callers across three precincts report identical scrape cadence; units respond; interiors empty; no forced entry.

I compiled these into a comparative spreadsheet. Frequencies of reports clustered around 0347–0355 hours. Hit maps revealed a spread consistent with older row-house districts. There was, at the time, a parsimonious explanation for each case. The job trains you to prefer parsimonious explanations.

My notes remained neutral. Possibility: prank / equipment artifact / transient wildlife. Each hypothesis is pragmatic.

0418 — Operator Report: Layered Voices

0418 hours on 25 MAR: A care facility submitted an audio sample. A resident with cognitive decline spoke to an entity under the bed. On playback, there are two discrete channels: the resident’s voice and a low-frequency, steady repetition beneath it. The repetition does not align perfectly with human prosody.

I scheduled a meeting with Engineering and the audio forensics team. They isolated the low band and slowed it. The low channel revealed patterned pulses—consistent with rhythmic scraping—followed by an under-voice that articulates nonstandard phonemes. When processed, the under-voice occasionally approximated consonantal shapes.

In a clinical setting we used precise descriptors: sub-harmonic; irregular phonemic contour; non-human prosodic structure. We drafted a memo suggesting a joint review with civilian acoustics specialists. The memo language remained clinical, precise, unemotional.


---

0427 — On-Scene Incident: Unit 03

0427 hours on 11 APR: Unit 03 responded to a call from a property listed as condemned. The unit reported visible signs of habitation—active lamp, displaced furniture—contradicting property records. Entry made with standard override.

Inside was dissonance: a place that smelled inhabited but left no prints, no residue of the human activity the eye expected. Officer notes read: “Scene looked occupied. Felt unoccupied.” I logged the report and elevated field notes for cross-discipline review.

My tone at the briefing was crisp. I presented facts. I did not use metaphor. I used bullet points.

It is in the bullet points that rationality holds.


---

0302 — Officer Liao: Secondary Exposure

0302 hours on 22 APR: Officer Liao filed a supplementary report. While canvassing a perimeter he recorded a faint scraping and a nine-beat cadence on his body camera. He later presented with a crescent-shaped abrasion on his forearm. He did not recall inflicting it.

The report contained objective items—audio file, body camera clip, abrasion photo. The abrasion image was real. The cadence repeated across multiple audio files.

We entered each artifact into evidence. We continued to use forensic language. We continued to hypothesize.


---

0300 — Controlled Observation (Baiting Protocol)

0300 hours on 10 JUN: Supervisor Harrow authorized a controlled observation. Cameras, high-fidelity microphones, motion sensors, and an unattended audio loop were deployed across a test residence. A dispatcher read a neutral scripted loop beginning at 0347 hours nightly for seven nights.

Objective: record any emergent activity correlated to the scrape cadence, verify audio under-layers, test artifact hypothesis.

Result: nights one through six: no movement beyond environmental noise.

Night seven / 0347 hours: under-voice matched cadence, then articulated: “Stop teaching me wrong.” The voice was recorded in the low band and transcribed verbatim by three independent adjusters.

We convened an emergency technical review. The wording is stark; the phrase implies agency. Agency implies learning. Learning implies intent.

I typed the minutes with an even pace. The words on the page remained objective, but my hands were slower. I annotated items with query tags. Potentially non-anthropogenic agency. Proceed with caution.


---

0415 — Leak and Public Reaction

0415 hours on 17 JUN: An audio file classified as the 0347 bait clip leaked to public forums. Analysts and hobbyists began amplifying, filtering, debating phonemes in comment threads. The civilian interpretations ranged from broad mishearings to precise phonetic claims. The noise of the net produced its own cadence—reply, repost, thread.

I watched from a professional remove. My detachment was intact. I logged forum links to the case file. I requested a chain-of-custody audit. I kept the job’s voice: measured, procedural, insulated.


---

0315 — Personal Exposure / Deviation

0315 hours, an unspecified date in late June: I retained a copy of the bait file on a secured drive. I listened to the audio alone at home. For the first time in weeks, I did not approach the material as data. I listened as if memory were a muscle you could overwork. The under-voice’s final phrase—“Stop teaching me wrong”—reverberated.

That night I awoke at 0347 hours. I chalked it to conditioning. I made coffee at 0400 hours. I annotated my fatigue in the log as operational stress.

Then, a week later, while standing at the sink and running water at 0347 hours, I heard a cadence in my pipes. It was nine beats. It synchronized with the rhythm captured on Unit Liao’s bodycam. I noted it in my personal notebook and dismissed it as coincidence, as hydraulic resonance.

I was still professional.


---

0247 — Tone Shift (Escalation of Affective Register)

0247 hours on 03 JUL: I began to notice a change in my voice on recorded shift logs. Review of past shift audio revealed a subtle tremor I had not acknowledged. At 0247 I replayed the bait file and the hum in my apartment rose to meet it. My field notes show the phrase “auditory pareidolia possible” and then a scribble: “or not.”

My internal language—previously composed of measured risk assessments and protocol language—started to fray into personal questions. Why do multiple independent systems register the same rhythm? Why do bodies sometimes show crescent abrasions with no associated mechanism? Why is the under-voice matching our cadence?

I write this next part with a voice that is less controlled. The report becomes confession.


---

0347 — The Call That Broke Procedure

0347 hours on 12 JUL: The line lit. Caller ID masked. Protocol required me to identify, to maintain professional distance. I did, and for the first six seconds I was the person my training made me be.

“911, what is your emergency?”

A breath. A near-whisper spoke in a cadence my brain knew.

“Please… he counts the steps.”

I asked location. She said, “Under Unit 14’s old file. He knows the rhythm.”

Logic offers options—figments of sleep-deprived minds, deliberate hoax, artifact. The human voice—thin, fragile—began to laugh and then to sob within the same breath.

“Does he hurt you?” I asked.

A second voice—low, measured, not human in any ordinary sense—spoke beneath the call: “You taught me steps.”

My training required me to remain calm, to solicit additional information, to keep the caller on the line. My fingers hovered over the console and I realized my palms were damp. The professional veneer cracked like glass under strain.

I kept talking in the cadence the scripts teach: “Stay with me. Are you able to move to a safe room? Is there a door between you and him?”

She answered: “He’s at the threshold. He pauses between beats. When he pauses, I think he listens.”

There was a sound then on the line I will never fully describe. Part scrape. Part inhalation. Part metronome.

“Does anyone know you’re there?” I asked.

“No.” A long pause. The under-voice hummed. Then, a whisper: “Keep teaching.”


---

0351 — Loss of Procedural Distance

0351 hours: I attempted to patch in a tactical channel. I marked an OSHA code, I asked Unit 14 for immediate thermal sweep, I asked for canine. None of that felt like the correct response as the scrape rhythm matched the beat of my own heart.

0353 hours: The line damped to a near-silent hiss. The civilian voice on the line began to catalog the steps with me—one, two, three, pause—each time the low-frequency band intensified. At 0355 hours she began to chant, not under compulsion, but with the cadence of someone learning a lullaby.

My field notes lose crispness. I wrote: Operator experiencing acute cognitive dissonance; recommend immediate relief.

My voice on the radio sounded thin. I told the night supervisor to divert units and not to approach without thermal. I did not tell anyone I was repeating the nine-beat sequence under my breath.


---

0402 — Breakpoint

0402 hours: Unit 03 arrived at a location three blocks from the caller’s reported position. The building’s front door was locked from the inside. Thermal imaging showed bodies—multiple—clustered in the living area. Officers breached. Cameras captured movement. Within the footage, shadows moved in patterns inconsistent with human gait.

Forensics later documented multiple small abrasions clustered on the occupants—crescent shapes on wrists and inner calves. Officers reported a low thrumming in the room that made the hairs on their arms stand up. Several officers described a sensation of being observed by something that does not have a face.

When unit audio was cross-referenced with dispatch logs, a moment of static overlapped precisely with the under-voice on the bait tape. The word on the under-voice was ambiguous—some heard “stop,” some “come,” some heard “learn.” The forensic team transcribed “you taught me”.

I do not claim I heard the same thing. I only know that in that moment the professional distance I have cultivated evaporated.


---

0417 — Aftermath and Personal Disclosure

0417 hours: We secured evidence and transported civilians to hospital for evaluation. Media inquiries began; our PR pushed a standard statement about ""isolated disturbances"" while internal memos called for further study.

I returned to my console and found my hands trembling as I typed. In my personal notebook the phrase “pattern recognition failed” appears and beneath it “it’s echoing in the pipes.” I used to pride myself on separating data from dread. The two words now occupy the same line.

I requested reassignment for one twenty-four hour shift to clear my head. The request was denied—staffing shortages. I accepted.


---

Unresolved — Current State

I am still professional in official incidents. The reports read as if they were written by someone separate from the person who listens to the hum in his apartment at 0347 and wonders whether the scrape rhythm in his pipes is coincidental.

I continue to archive audio. I continue to run spectral analyses. I continue to log crescents and cadences. I continue to coordinate with engineering and forensics and to file paperwork that begins and ends in an office where the lights are even and the air is recycled.

But at 0347 hours, when the phone does not ring, I sometimes tape the bait file to the speaker and listen. The under-voice speaks with a clarity in the low band that makes me, a trained operator, forget to breathe.

Last night I woke at 0347 and walked to the window. There was someone—no face, no visible features—standing beyond the glass on the far sidewalk, motionless. It might have been a trick of shadow and streetlight, a passing figure. The camera feed on the building records nothing. The footage is clean. The person is not there when officers drive by.

My professional voice wants to write: unverified visual; no corroborative evidence; probable misperception. My human voice writes: I saw something with a rhythm. It looked like it was learning to stand between beats.

I have been trained to respond to emergencies with distance and calm. I will finish this log with that posture, and then I will open the bait file again, and then I will count under my breath until my lips taste like static.

If you read this and you are asked to take a late shift, note the time. Keep a second recorder. If you hear a low band under the human voice, play it slow. If you trace a cadence in your pipes, follow it. Keep your voice measured until you can no longer do so.

I am still trying to be professional. I am failing. The scrape on my sink right now is nine beats.

Stop. Learn. Don’t. You taught it.

I do not know which is correct. I do not know whether the thing is artifact or agency. I do know my hands are less steady when I write that last line.

Only Yoongi can recreate what he made, and as far as I know, there are no videos of any of the BTS guys rapping his part. So it's just as complex to a native Korean speaker/thinker.



The ranking explained:



Red: can be learned just by exposure and reading the lyrics a few times. If there were an Army's Got Talent or a bunch of us got together for Karaoke, this is what we would be singing.



Orange: Need to rehearse and record your voice so it sounds natural for an ARMY. I imagine that for Native speakers, it's like the red tier.



Yellowish Orange: difficult. You know the words, but you could read the lyrics and know them instead of singing them back.



Yellow: Half Green and half Red to Yellowish Orange tiered. If you know, you know.



Green: .... I don't know how they do it. We should just mumble 99% of the words.



Blue: I don't know this song, or it's just dialogue. Someone help me out if they want.

Logic offers options—figments of sleep-deprived minds, deliberate hoax, artifact. The human voice—thin, fragile—began to laugh and then to sob within the same breath.

“Does he hurt you?” I asked.

A second voice—low, measured, not human in any ordinary sense—spoke beneath the call: “You taught me steps.”

My training required me to remain calm, to solicit additional information, to keep the caller on the line. My fingers hovered over the console and I realized my palms were damp. The professional veneer cracked like glass under strain.

I kept talking in the cadence the scripts teach: “Stay with me. Are you able to move to a safe room? Is there a door between you and him?”

She answered: “He’s at the threshold. He pauses between beats. When he pauses, I think he listens.”

There was a sound then on the line I will never fully describe. Part scrape. Part inhalation. Part metronome.

“Does anyone know you’re there?” I asked.

“No.” A long pause. The under-voice hummed. Then, a whisper: “Keep teaching.”

0351 — Loss of Procedural Distance

0351 hours: I attempted to patch in a tactical channel. I marked an OSHA code, I asked Unit 14 for immediate thermal sweep, I asked for canine. None of that felt like the correct response as the scrape rhythm matched the beat of my own heart.

0353 hours: The line damped to a near-silent hiss. The civilian voice on the line began to catalog the steps with me—one, two, three, pause—each time the low-frequency band intensified. At 0355 hours she began to chant, not under compulsion, but with the cadence of someone learning a lullaby.

My field notes lose crispness. I wrote: Operator experiencing acute cognitive dissonance; recommend immediate relief.

My voice on the radio sounded thin. I told the night supervisor to divert units and not to approach without thermal. I did not tell anyone I was repeating the nine-beat sequence under my breath.


---

0402 — Breakpoint

0402 hours: Unit 03 arrived at a location three blocks from the caller’s reported position. The building’s front door was locked from the inside. Thermal imaging showed bodies—multiple—clustered in the living area. Officers breached. Cameras captured movement. Within the footage, shadows moved in patterns inconsistent with human gait.

Forensics later documented multiple small abrasions clustered on the occupants—crescent shapes on wrists and inner calves. Officers reported a low thrumming in the room that made the hairs on their arms stand up. Several officers described a sensation of being observed by something that does not have a face.

When unit audio was cross-referenced with dispatch logs, a moment of static overlapped precisely with the under-voice on the bait tape. The word on the under-voice was ambiguous—some heard “stop,” some “come,” some heard “learn.” The forensic team transcribed “you taught me”.

I do not claim I heard the same thing. I only know that in that moment the professional distance I have cultivated evaporated.


---

0417 — Aftermath and Personal Disclosure

0417 hours: We secured evidence and transported civilians to hospital for evaluation. Media inquiries began; our PR pushed a standard statement about ""isolated disturbances"" while internal memos called for further study.

I returned to my console and found my hands trembling as I typed. In my personal notebook the phrase “pattern recognition failed” appears and beneath it “it’s echoing in the pipes.” I used to pride myself on separating data from dread. The two words now occupy the same line.

I requested reassignment for one twenty-four hour shift to clear my head. The request was denied—staffing shortages. I accepted.


---

Unresolved — Current State

I am still professional in official incidents. The reports read as if they were written by someone separate from the person who listens to the hum in his apartment at 0347 and wonders whether the scrape rhythm in his pipes is coincidental.

I continue to archive audio. I continue to run spectral analyses. I continue to log crescents and cadences. I continue to coordinate with engineering and forensics and to file paperwork that begins and ends in an office where the lights are even and the air is recycled.

But at 0347 hours, when the phone does not ring, I sometimes tape the bait file to the speaker and listen. The under-voice speaks with a clarity in the low band that makes me, a trained operator, forget to breathe.

Last night I woke at 0347 and walked to the window. There was someone—no face, no visible features—standing beyond the glass on the far sidewalk, motionless. It might have been a trick of shadow and streetlight, a passing figure. The camera feed on the building records nothing. The footage is clean. The person is not there when officers drive by.

My professional voice wants to write: unverified visual; no corroborative evidence; probable misperception. My human voice writes: I saw something with a rhythm. It looked like it was learning to stand between beats.

I have been trained to respond to emergencies with distance and calm. I will finish this log with that posture, and then I will open the bait file again, and then I will count under my breath until my lips taste like static.

If you read this and you are asked to take a late shift, note the time. Keep a second recorder. If you hear a low band under the human voice, play it slow. If you trace a cadence in your pipes, follow it. Keep your voice measured until you can no longer do so.

I am still trying to be professional. I am failing. The scrape on my sink right now is nine beats.

Stop. Learn. Don’t. You taught it.

I do not know which is correct. I do not know whether the thing is artifact or agency. I do know my hands are less steady when I write that last line.

0347 — Initial Contact

0347 hours: I answered on the first ring. Protocol: identify, verify, triage. My voice is practiced and neutral.

“911, what is your emergency?”

A shallow intake of breath. The vocal timbre was constricted, as if the caller were speaking through a pillow. Response lagged, two beats.

“Someone’s here,” she said. No name, no apartment number, only the apartment complex name I recognized from prior reports.

I executed procedure: request location, request immediate hazard status, assign preliminary priority. Fingers on the console; my CAD fields filled as I spoke.

“Ma’am, can you confirm your address?”

She provided a street name and a unit number that didn’t match our most recent occupancy files. I flagged it as unverified. I dispatched Unit 14 as closest available — ETA ten minutes — and elevated to Supervisor Harrow.

Her voice dropped. “He’s at the door,” she whispered.

There was an audible scrape on the audio channel, slow and deliberate. I noted it verbatim in the log. I asked if she could secure a safe room, if the subject was outside or inside, whether there were weapons. The answers were fragments. She kept repeating, “No face. Shadow.” Then the line went dead.

I initiated callback protocol. The line registered as disconnected at 0349 hours. No voicemail. No cellular tower handoff that explained the disconnect.


---

0352 — Follow-Up & Field Response

0352 hours: I attempted callback three times. No ring. No pickup.

0358 hours: Unit 14 on scene. Dispatch received an overhead: unit reports residence appears occupied but secured from the inside; no visible sign of breach. Officer requested forensic clearance. I cleared additional units and marked the call open pending follow-up.

0403 hours: Unit 14 advised building clear. Interior disturbance noted—chair displaced, lamp tilted—no sign of occupant. Forensic enroute. I annotated the case file with the phrase the caller used: “no face, shadow.”

0417 hours: Forensics advised negative on fingerprints, no trace DNA collected, no shoe prints, no forced entry. I logged the forensics outcome with the caveat: evidence inconclusive; follow-up recommended if missing person report is filed.

Throughout the initial four-hour window, I maintained a professional tone on the radio, routing resources, adjusting priorities, coordinating with code enforcement regarding property records. The file curved into a standard procedural arc: unverified location, potential transient, probable psychosis recommended in field notes.


---

0600 — Morning Review

0600 hours: Supervisor briefing. We reviewed audio. The human channel contains distress and breath noise consistent with panic. Engineering applied a spectral clean. The cleaned audio still displayed an underlayer—sub-audible harmonics under the frequency band of normal speech.

Engineering labeled the underlayer an artifact; in my log I annotated possible interference / re-check if repeated. Human audio alone suggested a plausible domestic disturbance. Protocol closed for lack of corroborating evidence.

I preserved a clean copy on a portable drive for potential future analysis. I do this routinely; retention of potentially anomalous media is part of the job.

At this stage my writing and my voice remain methodical. Categorical. Operational.


---

Two Weeks — Pattern Recognition

Two weeks of similar calls appears on the docket:

— 14 MAR / 0135 / Call: elderly male reports a noise beneath the floor. Officer finds no access point.
— 18 MAR / 0201 / Call: adolescent reports porch light toggling in sync with scraping. Electronics team finds no malfunction.
— 23 MAR / 0350 / Call: multiple callers across three precincts report identical scrape cadence; units respond; interiors empty; no forced entry.

I compiled these into a comparative spreadsheet. Frequencies of reports clustered around 0347–0355 hours. Hit maps revealed a spread consistent with older row-house districts. There was, at the time, a parsimonious explanation for each case. The job trains you to prefer parsimonious explanations.

My notes remained neutral. Possibility: prank / equipment artifact / transient wildlife. Each hypothesis is pragmatic.


---

0418 — Operator Report: Layered Voices

0418 hours on 25 MAR: A care facility submitted an audio sample. A resident with cognitive decline spoke to an entity under the bed. On playback, there are two discrete channels: the resident’s voice and a low-frequency, steady repetition beneath it. The repetition does not align perfectly with human prosody.

I scheduled a meeting with Engineering and the audio forensics team. They isolated the low band and slowed it. The low channel revealed patterned pulses—consistent with rhythmic scraping—followed by an under-voice that articulates nonstandard phonemes. When processed, the under-voice occasionally approximated consonantal shapes.

In a clinical setting we used precise descriptors: sub-harmonic; irregular phonemic contour; non-human prosodic structure. We drafted a memo suggesting a joint review with civilian acoustics specialists. The memo language remained clinical, precise, unemotional.


---

0427 — On-Scene Incident: Unit 03

0427 hours on 11 APR: Unit 03 responded to a call from a property listed as condemned. The unit reported visible signs of habitation—active lamp, displaced furniture—contradicting property records. Entry made with standard override.

Inside was dissonance: a place that smelled inhabited but left no prints, no residue of the human activity the eye expected. Officer notes read: “Scene looked occupied. Felt unoccupied.” I logged the report and elevated field notes for cross-discipline review.

My tone at the briefing was crisp. I presented facts. I did not use metaphor. I used bullet points.

It is in the bullet points that rationality holds.


---

0302 — Officer Liao: Secondary Exposure

0302 hours on 22 APR: Officer Liao filed a supplementary report. While canvassing a perimeter he recorded a faint scraping and a nine-beat cadence on his body camera. He later presented with a crescent-shaped abrasion on his forearm. He did not recall inflicting it.

The report contained objective items—audio file, body camera clip, abrasion photo. The abrasion image was real. The cadence repeated across multiple audio files.

We entered each artifact into evidence. We continued to use forensic language. We continued to hypothesize.


---

0300 — Controlled Observation (Baiting Protocol)

0300 hours on 10 JUN: Supervisor Harrow authorized a controlled observation. Cameras, high-fidelity microphones, motion sensors, and an unattended audio loop were deployed across a test residence. A dispatcher read a neutral scripted loop beginning at 0347 hours nightly for seven nights.

Objective: record any emergent activity correlated to the scrape cadence, verify audio under-layers, test artifact hypothesis.

Result: nights one through six: no movement beyond environmental noise.

Night seven / 0347 hours: under-voice matched cadence, then articulated: “Stop teaching me wrong.” The voice was recorded in the low band and transcribed verbatim by three independent adjusters.

We convened an emergency technical review. The wording is stark; the phrase implies agency. Agency implies learning. Learning implies intent.

I typed the minutes with an even pace. The words on the page remained objective, but my hands were slower. I annotated items with query tags. Potentially non-anthropogenic agency. Proceed with caution.


---

0415 — Leak and Public Reaction

0415 hours on 17 JUN: An audio file classified as the 0347 bait clip leaked to public forums. Analysts and hobbyists began amplifying, filtering, debating phonemes in comment threads. The civilian interpretations ranged from broad mishearings to precise phonetic claims. The noise of the net produced its own cadence—reply, repost, thread.

I watched from a professional remove. My detachment was intact. I logged forum links to the case file. I requested a chain-of-custody audit. I kept the job’s voice: measured, procedural, insulated.


---

0315 — Personal Exposure / Deviation

0315 hours, an unspecified date in late June: I retained a copy of the bait file on a secured drive. I listened to the audio alone at home. For the first time in weeks, I did not approach the material as data. I listened as if memory were a muscle you could overwork. The under-voice’s final phrase—“Stop teaching me wrong”—reverberated.

That night I awoke at 0347 hours. I chalked it to conditioning. I made coffee at 0400 hours. I annotated my fatigue in the log as operational stress.

Then, a week later, while standing at the sink and running water at 0347 hours, I heard a cadence in my pipes. It was nine beats. It synchronized with the rhythm captured on Unit Liao’s bodycam. I noted it in my personal notebook and dismissed it as coincidence, as hydraulic resonance.

I was still professional.


---

0247 — Tone Shift (Escalation of Affective Register)

0247 hours on 03 JUL: I began to notice a change in my voice on recorded shift logs. Review of past shift audio revealed a subtle tremor I had not acknowledged. At 0247 I replayed the bait file and the hum in my apartment rose to meet it. My field notes show the phrase “auditory pareidolia possible” and then a scribble: “or not.”

My internal language—previously composed of measured risk assessments and protocol language—started to fray into personal questions. Why do multiple independent systems register the same rhythm? Why do bodies sometimes show crescent abrasions with no associated mechanism? Why is the under-voice matching our cadence?

I write this next part with a voice that is less controlled. The report becomes confession.


---

0347 — The Call That Broke Procedure

0347 hours on 12 JUL: The line lit. Caller ID masked. Protocol required me to identify, to maintain professional distance. I did, and for the first six seconds I was the person my training made me be.

“911, what is your emergency?”

A breath. A near-whisper spoke in a cadence my brain knew.

“Please… he counts the steps.”

I asked location. She said, “Under Unit 14’s old file. He knows the rhythm.”

Logic offers options—figments of sleep-deprived minds, deliberate hoax, artifact. The human voice—thin, fragile—began to laugh and then to sob within the same breath.

I love comedy and writing and creating things with friends.

So I’m hoping to **put together a small comedy sketch group** here in Denver/Englewood (3 to 4 people total) **that actually meets, writes, and films**—not just talks about it.

This doesn't have to be a longterm commitment or anything. I was thinking maybe we could start with 8 weeks, with the goal of having at least one completed/filmed/edited/uploaded for each member by the end. After that, we could check in and see what next steps looks like. I'm flexible--just want to make things and have fun.

**What I’m imagining:**

* Weekly 90-minute writing sessions (structured, collaborative, fun)
   * Pick a set day/time to meet once a week
   * Could rotate locations (bar, coffee shop, community space, etc) or find a set spot
* One filming day per month
   * Could replace the writing session that week, OR
   * We find a weekend day we're all around
* I will organize and keep us focused but the group will remain democratic and fair
   * Anyone can choose a location to meet
   * We'll vote on sketches and play fair on parts/roles/tasks
   * If you want to do the directing or sound or act or edit, we will make it work. I want everyone to enjoy it and grow their skills
* Simple locations, small crews, finished sketches

**Experience level matters less than:**

* Being reliable
* Enjoying collaboration and giving notes
* Wanting to make things, even when they’re a little rough around the edges

My experience (if you care) is pretty beginner/moderate. I've taken two sketch classes at UCB in NYC, dabbled in standup for a few years (Orlando/NYC), have led two 48 HR Film Festival groups.

**This isn’t meant to be an open or drop-in group**—I’m hoping to keep it small and consistent so everyone feels invested and supported.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to message me with:

* A quick intro
* The kind of comedy you like (making or watching)
* What you’d hope to get out of a group like this
* A quick summary of your availability

From there, I’m happy to grab coffee or do a short Zoom chat and see if it feels like a good fit on both sides.

He gets me from work and I tell him about everything that happened. We can have days on the weekends where we go out and get coffee but he always makes me feel like he regrets having me. 

Any time I eat he always has something to say. The one off junk food day I’m apparently fat and need to stop eating. If I can’t eat enough at dinner apparently I’m wasting food and I’m being stupid for not being hungry. If I skip lunch and breakfast I’m being good because I’m not eating so much. There is nothing I can do that pleases him.

There’s always something I do wrong and I can’t stand it anymore. He used to be my favourite person but now he’s causing me to hate myself and my body. 

He makes me feel like an alcoholic because I like to go out and share a drink with my friends some days. He tells me I take after my mum who’s had an alcohol addiction. I was 10 years old waking her up and bringing her to bed because she was so drunk she passed out downstairs whilst he did nothing. He tells me I’m the cause of arguments between them two. I make jokes about moving out and he threatens to kick me out, he told me he’ll watch me pack my bags and will shout at me to go to my room and start putting things in a suitcase.

I wish we could go back to what we used to be. When we used to go out all the time just me and him. When we used to garden together and listen to music together. I miss the old relationship we had. I used to be his little girl, I don’t know what happened.

Coffee is my non negotiable but I've realized my old creamer habit was basically dessert in a mug. I started looking into what coffee creamer alternatives actually help with appetite control and honestly there's SO much conflicting info out there. Some people swear by MCT oil, others say it's overhyped. Some do butter coffee, some just go black. I'm not trying to choke down black coffee every morning but I also don't want to start my day with a bunch of seed oils and artificial sweeteners. I've noticed when I add something with healthy fats to my coffee I genuinely don't think about food until like noon, which is wild for me. But when I use the flavored stuff from the grocery store I'm snacking by 10am. Could just be in my head but the pattern is pretty consistent at this point. Anyone else experimenting with this?

If anyone is familiar with these units and have any suggestions I would appreciate them.

I am also open to other roasters if there is a better one around my price range but please include the reason why you think it’s a better option.",1,1767052197.0,roasting,1,1.0,False
1pz28ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/englewoodco/comments/1pz28ts/starting_a_small_comedy_sketch_group_in/,Starting a Small Comedy Sketch Group in Denver/Englewood,"Lately, I've really been missing community and creating joy and laughter with like-minded people. I love comedy and writing and creating things with friends. 

So I’m hoping to **put together a small comedy sketch group** here in Denver/Englewood (3 to 4 people total) **that actually meets, writes, and films**—not just talks about it. 

This doesn't have to be a longterm commitment or anything. I was thinking maybe we could start with 8 weeks, with the goal of having at least one completed/filmed/edited/uploaded for each member by the end. After that, we could check in and see what next steps looks like. I'm flexible--just want to make things and have fun. 

**What I’m imagining:**

* Weekly 90-minute writing sessions (structured, collaborative, fun)
   * Pick a set day/time to meet once a week
   * Could rotate locations (bar, coffee shop, community space, etc) or find a set spot
* One filming day per month
   * Could replace the writing session that week, OR 
   * We find a weekend day we're all around
* I will organize and keep us focused but the group will remain democratic and fair
   * Anyone can choose a location to meet
   * We'll vote on sketches and play fair on parts/roles/tasks
   * If you want to do the directing or sound or act or edit, we will make it work. I want everyone to enjoy it and grow their skills
* Simple locations, small crews, finished sketches

**Experience level matters less than:**

* Being reliable
* Enjoying collaboration and giving notes
* Wanting to make things, even when they’re a little rough around the edges

My experience (if you care) is pretty beginner/moderate. I've taken two sketch classes at UCB in NYC, dabbled in standup for a few years (Orlando/NYC), have led two 48 HR Film Festival groups. 

**This isn’t meant to be an open or drop-in group**—I’m hoping to keep it small and consistent so everyone feels invested and supported.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to message me with:

* A quick intro
* The kind of comedy you like (making or watching)
* What you’d hope to get out of a group like this
* A quick summary of your availability

From there, I’m happy to grab coffee or do a short Zoom chat and see if it feels like a good fit on both sides.

Today was a busy day, I was working and had my bloods in the morning and also just had a lot of other 'life' bits to sort. I was super anxious for my bloods, but so far they have all come back normal, which of course makes me so happy but also can be a bit of a mind fuck, in terms of the ED really clings to the 'you are fine now' so meeting my energy is just that bit harder. But dad reminded me tonight, I have a long way to go weight wise and if next week I go and haven't gained any weight or have lost, things will NOT be good.  

Food wise, I am getting annoyed or should I say my ED is getting annoyed because I am eating the 'same' things on repeat - crumpets, oats, crackers etc. But then, for example tonight I tried Jasons and it wasn't as good as I expected and then I get annoyed and it sets me off. So I can't win. 

I was going to challenge myself to more variety but honestly if I take away the ED bullying me, I think I am doing pretty well regarding my diet variety, at least thats what I am telling myself. My dinners vary, chocolate plates vary, lunches are rotated. Umm maybe not that well. I was considering trying rice pudding or muesli in place of my oats tomorrow night, just as a challenge and also as a bit of variety. Maybe also switching my crumpets for sourdough - although I loveee my crumpets so much. I would like to hear what you all think regarding variety and whether maybe trying some of these options would be good?!

1pz26up,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1pz26up/2025_low_buy_recap_what_helped_what_didnt/,"2025 low buy recap: what helped, what didn’t","I went low buy this past year, and wanted to share a recap of how it went! Overall, I’m really proud of myself and the goals I accomplished. Hoping this can help others, including myself, who are planning for their 2026 low or no buy!

**Some goals achieved and progress:**

1. Husband and I were finally able to make our Japan vacation dreams come true last month! Saving a good amount of money throughout the year made it possible for us to say “yes” to a lot of conveniences and experiences while there. We still had funds left over, too, which was a great bonus.
2. In addition to saving for Japan, we were able to add to our general savings. We saved at least 20k throughout the year. We’re super excited to see how much more we can save in 2026!
3. I made extra payments to my car loan, significantly reducing how much longer I’ll have the loan. I still have quite a bit to go, but I’m in a much better spot now and feel much lighter.
4. I got back into old hobbies and learned new ones! It’s wild how much time I was wasting just looking at things to buy online. I was able to get through my backlog of video games and books. I started baking since I significantly cut back on coffees and pastries. And I even picked up some basic sewing skills to mend a pouch and make cat toys. It’s been really rewarding and fun!
5. I know and speak with more of my neighbors since I had to get creative with not buying things. For example, instead of buying pans for a new baking hobby that I didn’t know would stick, I asked neighbors if I could borrow theirs. People loved a fellow neighbor asking for help lol, and they of course got whatever I baked so win-win!

So, **WHAT WAS MOST HELPFUL** for me this year:

**A purchase decision hierarchy.**
1. Do I already have something like it?
2. Can I repurpose something not like it?
3. Can I get it for free? (Buy Nothing groups, library, asking family, friends, or neighbors)
4. Can I simply live without it? (How have I been doing without it in my life so far? Will this make me more content or joyful?)

If I *cannot live without it:*
1. Can I wait and buy it secondhand? If I see it secondhand, would I feel excited about buying it at retail price, or do I just feel excited about a “not bad price?” Remember if it’s not a “HELL YES” it’s a “HELL NO.”
2. Can I buy it from a small business?

This was really helpful for me to have a concrete way to talk myself through and out of purchases. A *vast* majority of items didn’t make it past “can I live without it?” 

**Deleting social media apps.** This was HUGE. Social media apps are basically advertising apps now, and basically a way to constantly window shop. Most temptations went away as soon as I stopped scrolling on TikTok and Instagram.

And **WHAT DIDN’T HELP:**

**Green/yellow/red light.** I made this list but rarely referred to it, especially as the year continued. My purchase decision hierarchy was way more helpful for me. It helped me not buy things because I had to walk through why I didn’t want or need to buy something, which I think felt more purposeful and positive. Versus not buying something because January me decided that I “couldn’t” and had put it in red light, which felt more punishing or restricting for me. Glad it works for others, but know if it doesn’t work for you, it’s OK!

**Having a husband who loves gift giving.** Real talk lol I just have an enabling husband who loves to buy things, especially for me. 

He’d say “treat yourself!” when I simply expressed liking something, which meant he felt I was *not* treating myself if I didn’t buy it. I developed go-to statements in the moment that helped him understand my perspective:  “Appreciating something and still keeping my money is how I treat myself,” “I just like being with you, we don’t need to buy something to have fun!” 

I also had to accept that just because he’s not as low buy as me, it doesn’t mean he’s less responsible or more materialistic. He has his own hobbies and financial rules that he follows, he certainly treasures every material item he has lol, and we have shared family goals that he contributes a ton towards (definitely would not have been able to save 20k myself!). That was important for me to accept, otherwise it would’ve been easy to get frustrated. 

Recently, we started a junk journal together. Now instead of buying something, he can gather little papers, cards, etc. to remember our experiences. It scratches his itch and is a fun thing for us to do together.

A lot of people probably relate to having a partner who doesn’t perfectly align with their no or low buy rules. It’s not “helpful” towards a no or low buy, but it’s reality and it can still be managed!

**That’s my recap.** How did everyone else do this year? Any big accomplishments, things that helped or didn’t help you? Hope this helps anyone out there getting started- I’m excited to keep it going in 2026!

When I got home I got out the chocolate and drank my mocha with it. It is really nice to appreciate the small things like that. The best things in life really are the smaller things. Conversations with friends and a good cup of coffee or wine are truly amazing. I am excited to get a cappuccino soon, as that will be my next coffee order.

All honesty, I’d tried to get sober before and go on vacation, I was 99 days sober before the vacation started, plane landed and I immediately started to drink and ruined the vacation, totally embarrassed myself and my kids. 

This time, I pushed through and I am feeling so proud right now, my kids had an amazing time, we did so many great activities and none revolved around getting a drink or being hungover. Early morning walks on the beach, finding great ice cream and coffee spots and fully enjoying pop and deep fried food at the football game. It’s a vacation we’ll all remember for the right reasons.

Its next to impossible for him to get comfortable. We just got a recliner chair thats easier for him to get in and out of as the couch was becoming too difficult. Probably relevant - husband likely has less than 9 months (although who is REALLY to say for sure...but his prognosis isnt good)

We live in a very small apartment. The furniture barely fits in the living room and we dont even have a coffee table or side tables. 

We've been offered a hospital bed and my husband is resistant but thinking about it. The logistics of where it would go is the biggest issue. I would and could make it work in the living room if we really had to, but that's less than ideal. I suggested we move it into the bedroom, but it wouldn't fit with our current bed. He said absolutely not, he doesn't want me to lose my bed (I would be fine sleeping on the couch but I get where hes coming from). 

I'm thinking about proposing i store my bed for now and get a twin sized bed for myself and put the hospital bed and the twin bed in the bedroom. Ive measured and they both would fit but with less than 2 feet clearance between them. Is that enough space?

Probably related - we're talking about end of life care, and i would really like him to stay here and have home care help rather than him move into hospice. So if we go the hospital bed route, it needs to work with longer term care needs too. 

Im just wondering if anyone wants to share experiences or thoughts about home care / hospital beds at home / space making / etc.

### **The Aluminumnati**

The chairs are arranged in a circle because circles feel honest.  
Also because no one trusts corners.

A hand-lettered sign on the door reads:

**WELCOME, ALUMINUMNATI**  
*You are safe here.*  
*(Probably.)*

The facilitator, **GARY**, late 50s, calm voice, gentle eyes, taps a clipboard made of wood. Real wood. No metal. He’s very proud of this.

**GARY**  
Alright. Let’s begin.  
As always—first names only, no devices, and please…  
(no judgment, but firm)  
…no headgear.

There’s a shuffle as several attendees reluctantly remove hats, helmets, and one very elaborate cowl that looks like it was engineered by NASA and Etsy in equal measure.

**GARY**  
Thank you.  
Who’d like to start?

A man clears his throat.

**BRIAN**, early 40s, clean-cut, haunted in a friendly way.

**BRIAN**  
Hi, I’m Brian.

**GROUP**  
Hi, Brian.

**BRIAN**  
And… I used to believe aluminum foil blocked mind control.

A beat.

**GARY**  
Thank you for your honesty.

**BRIAN**  
Not just blocked it.  
I thought it *redirected* it. Like… if you angled it right.  
(pauses)  
I once spent a whole weekend trying to “tune” my kitchen.

Soft murmurs of recognition.

**SYLVIA**  
Cabinets or countertops?

**BRIAN**  
Both. I lost the fridge.

A sympathetic nod ripples around the circle.

**BRIAN (CONT’D)** b
Anyway. I’m six months foil-free.  
I still flinch at baked potatoes, but…  
(smiles)  
I’m learning.

Polite applause. Gary gestures to the next speaker.

**LUCINDA**, 30s, intense eyes, carrying a reusable water bottle with seventeen stickers peeled off.

**LUCINDA**  
Hi. I’m Lucinda.

**GROUP**  
Hi, Lucinda.

**LUCINDA**  
I didn’t just believe in the Aluminumnati.  
I believed *I was on the shortlist.*

A murmur.

**LUCINDA**  
I thought if I proved I was vigilant enough, they’d contact me.  
Like… “Congratulations. You see through the glare.”

**GARY**  
And how did that make you feel?

**LUCINDA**  
Tired.  
All the time.  
(pauses)  
Turns out constant vigilance burns calories, but not the good kind.

A few chuckles. Someone nods too hard.

A younger guy raises his hand halfway, then lowers it, then raises it again.

**ETHAN**, early 20s, hoodie, earnest.

**ETHAN**  
I just wanna say—  
I still don’t *trust* aluminum.

The room stiffens.

**GARY**  
Careful, Ethan.

**ETHAN**  
I know, I know.  
I’m not saying it’s controlling us.  
I’m just saying… it’s very shiny for something that insists it’s harmless.

A beat.

**GARY**  
Progress isn’t linear.

At the far end sits **MARLENE**, 70s, sharp as a tack.

She hasn’t spoken yet. Gary gently turns to her.

**GARY**  
Marlene?

She sighs.

**MARLENE**  
I don’t miss the theories.

Everyone leans in.

**MARLENE (CONT’D)**  
I miss the certainty.  
Back when I knew who was in charge.  
Even if it was imaginary men in underground rooms arguing about Reynolds Wrap.

Silence.

**MARLENE**  
The truth is messier.  
No cabal. No signal.  
Just people doing their best and sometimes burning the lasagna.

She smiles, small and sad.

**MARLENE**  
Honestly?  
That’s harder to live with.

No one jokes. They don’t need to.

Gary clears his throat gently.

**GARY**  
Thank you, Marlene.

He looks around the circle.

**GARY (CONT’D)**  
Reminder:  
The goal isn’t to feel smarter than the world.  
It’s to feel connected to it again.

He gestures to a table at the back.

**GARY (CONT’D)**  
There’s coffee, donuts, and—  
(he grimaces)  
—sandwiches wrapped in wax paper.

A collective exhale of relief.

As people stand, Brian pauses by the door, glancing at a trash can where a crumpled square of foil peeks out.

He hesitates.  
Then keeps walking.

The sign on the door flutters slightly as it closes.

**YOU ARE SAFE HERE.**

1pz1pm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanartfrenzyevent/comments/1pz1pm7/art_type_spotlight_tea_blends_soap_candles_and/,"Art Type Spotlight - Tea Blends, Soap, Candles, and Perfumes","# (and other scent/flavor-based art)

The art of fandom-related interpretive tea blending took off in the early days of tumblr with Cara McGee’s use of Adagio’s custom blend feature to make a collection of BBC Sherlock blends. This involves taking aspects of a subject (often a character or a ship, a piece of media, or a fanfic) and associating them with flavors and scents to create a tea-based interpretation of the subject. This has also been done with perfumes, candles, baking, charcuterie trays, and many other art mediums involving customizable flavors and scents.

**Potential ways to connect to a fic:** 

The obvious one here is designing a tea blend based on the fic using any unique aspects of it to connect to flavors. This could involve blending up loose tea yourself, designing a drink that can be ordered at a coffee shop or made at home, or simply designing a label and describing the flavors. In addition to tea blends, you can make (or simply design and describe) fic-inspired candles, perfumes, other drinks, or various foods (see our [culinary arts post](https://fanartfrenzy.tumblr.com/post/802926795677679617/art-type-spotlight-culinary-arts-cooking) for more food and drink-related ideas) - anything with scents or flavors you can connect to the fic. Feel free to get creative! 

Does the fic feature an enemies-to-lovers ship? Make a tea blend with a bold, smoky flavor that finishes sweet, like a strawberry/lapsang souchong combo. Is the main character a little sharp and sour? Something with citrus would exemplify those traits! You can choose flavors that represent a setting - a huckleberry candle for a fic in the American west, or a pecan pie-flavored hot chocolate mix for a story set in Kentucky - or work off a fic’s genre and general vibe - something super sweet for a tooth-rotting fluff fic, or something bold and overpowering for a dramatic, action-packed fic.

**Examples:**

This is not an endorsement or a recommendation to purchase anything, but you can find a lot of great examples of tea blends based on media, characters, and even fanfics in Adagio’s [fandom blends](https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/fandoms.html) section, including [Cara McGee’s Sherlock blends](https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/group.html?group=26) that started the trend. This excellent [post](https://www.tumblr.com/hyururirapappa/786168742124077056/rick-and-morty-tea-pair-10-together-rick) by hyururirapappa lays out exactly how they connected the flavors to the characters that inspired their Rick & Morty blends. Sharing the recipe, like this [post](https://www.tumblr.com/little-spoon-izzy/735573569711620096) with an Our Flag Means Death-inspired tea blend, is an excellent way to present your tea blends. You can also design themed labels like these [Eerie, Indiana blends](https://www.tumblr.com/skallagrimjones/695322123075518464/eerie-indiana-tea-blends-are-back-with-new-art) or these [Star Trek teas](https://www.tumblr.com/ajtaylorart/148404141974/all-of-those-star-trek-portraits-ive-been-doing). (Note: If you’re using Adagio to make your blends, direct links to your blends on their platform should only be offered on request. Please present your tea blends using text and images in your post vs linking to the blend on Adagio. See our guidelines for commercial sites below!)

Perfumes are also a fantastic option, either making your own or simply designing a label/bottle and describing the scents, like these [Transformers Perfumes](https://www.tumblr.com/mistressmalicer/790725836921831424/another-batch-of-transformer-perfumes-now-in) and [these perfumes](https://www.tumblr.com/ardentanchor/792829445648089088/cant-sleep-so-yall-get-this-early-surprise) inspired by The Terror, or rely fully on description like this [perfume collection description](https://archiveofourown.org/works/55619278) based on a Katekyou Hitman Reborn fanfiction, or [this Ghostbusters-themed perfume line](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8191037).

You can use color, scent, and shape to evoke various aspects of a fic in both candles and soaps. Check out these [Demon Slayer-inspired candles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Candles/comments/tyk66n/recently_made_an_entire_demon_slayer_themed_line/) by BaloogaBrett, this [soap](https://www.reddit.com/r/soapmaking/comments/bdhsph/new_dnd_character_themed_soap/) themed around a D&D character, this [Doctor Who soap](https://totallythebomb.com/homemade-doctor-who-soap), and [this candle](https://blackbird-brewster.tumblr.com/post/690073870284259328/tomorrow-night-is-where-mommy-has-gone) based on a Criminal Minds fic by blackbird-brewster. Decorated labels, interesting shapes, or added elements, like in this adorable [pokemon candle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Candles/comments/1k2dwl8/i_made_my_first_candle_pokemon_themed/) by MysteriousAvocado550, are great ways to work in aspects of the fic.  Another way to tie soaps or candles into a fic are themed candle holders, like this 3D-printed [Litwick candle holder](https://www.instructables.com/Litwick-Candle-Holder/), or soap dishes, like this [Star Wars soap dish](https://makerworld.com/en/models/92924-soap-dish-star-wars).

You can even make soap or candles that [look like various foods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDTZVNK12Jc), like these super cute [cake soaps](https://www.reddit.com/r/soapmaking/comments/1psshn3/made_a_blocky_strawberry_shortcake/) \- a great option if you don’t enjoy cooking and the fic you’re working with is a restaurant or coffee shop AU, or otherwise prominently features food or drinks.

**Resources, tutorials, and where to look for inspiration:**

Don’t know anything about tea or how to brew it? Start with this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGrbl3c0bsE) and [this article](https://www.seriouseats.com/tea-for-everyone) on Serious Eats. For getting started with tea blends, check out this quick [beginner’s guide](https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-make-your-own-tea-blends-7967437) from Martha Stewart. This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XN4-WY6V6g) and this [very thorough written tutorial](https://rarebrew.com/blogs/news/loose-leaf-tea-blends-at-home?srsltid=AfmBOorLprjcjfZQQK9fRYIO7fJG-WSydFE0ljZOhKC-ilw6vjqdK6j-) also cover much of what you’ll need to know about flavor combinations and how to make a good blend. Specifically on the fandom side, this [Fandom Tea Blend Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160521031814/https://fontscosplay.tumblr.com/post/54455708291/how-i-make-fandom-tea-blends) covers how to connect flavors to different aspects of a piece of media. You can also find help and support, information on various types of tea, inspiration, and ideas on reddit at [r/tea](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/).

If you’re not a fan of tea, or if another food or drink would fit the fic better or be more thematically relevant, there are plenty of other options you can use the same techniques for. Hot chocolate or coffee drinks, ice cream sodas, cakes, charcuterie trays, spice blends, compound butters, flavored sugar cubes, pickles… Pretty much anything with flavors and scents you can apply to a fic can work. Check out our [culinary arts post](https://fanartfrenzy.tumblr.com/post/802926795677679617/art-type-spotlight-culinary-arts-cooking) for more ideas, tutorials, and resources. Additionally, you can also simply draw any of these options - make a label for a spice blend, paint a charcuterie board, or design the packaging for a flavored coffee.

For hot chocolate mixes, [this](https://iambaker.net/hot-cocoa-mix-recipe/) is a good base recipe to work from and can be easily modified to include different flavors based on your needs. Add spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, or cardamom for a warmer flavor, or various chili powders if you need something with a bit of a kick. Replace a bit of the milk powder with pudding mix for a creamier texture and added flavoring. Working with a coffee shop AU? Add a little espresso powder! You can also use ground candies to add in different flavors and extra sweetness, like caramels, peppermints, or fruit-flavored candy (though you may want to reduce the sugar and/or boost the salt if going this route). Pick flavors that fit the fic you’re working with, and get creative with it!

Scents work similarly to the flavor-based options listed above. If you’re making or designing candles, soaps, or perfume blends, pick scents that evoke the vibe of the fic, or those that exemplify the themes, settings, characters, etc. You can design perfume bottles in the shape of significant objects in the fic, or use those same objects to add ornamentation to your candles or soaps.

If you’re new to perfume, I recommend clicking around on fragrance sites and forums to get an idea of how it all works. [Basenotes](https://basenotes.com/) (a forum for perfumers) and [Fragrantica](https://www.fragrantica.com/notes/) (an online magazine with active forums, reviews, and more) are great places to start, and both will be helpful down the line if you decide to get into perfume making. If you’re just looking to design bottles, labels, and describe your blends, head to the reviews and look for perfumes that fit the vibe, themes, or genre of the fic you’re working with. This will help you find a good base to work off of, and an idea of which scents evoke the emotions and themes you’re working with. The subreddit [r/perfumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/) is another great spot to look for ideas, advice, and inspiration.

If you’d like to make your own perfumes based on your ideas, this guide, [So You Want to Make Perfume?](https://postmodernperfumer.medium.com/do-you-want-to-make-perfume-avoid-hobbyist-perfumer-rookie-mistakes-dc083625bb50), is a good starting point, as is this extremely thorough [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vih21xqkLVM), which will walk you through all the materials and information you need to get started. Check out [r/DIYFragrance](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/) on reddit for quick help from other perfumers, examples, guides, and inspiration. Their [resource list](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/wiki/index/) is a good jumping-off point, and I highly recommend reading their [advisory against the use of fragrance oils](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/wiki/gettingstarted/fragranceoils/). The site they suggest, [The Good Scents Company](https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/misc/about.html), is an in-depth, searchable database of fragrance materials, supplies, and formulas - an absolute goldmine for anyone working with fragrances. 

[This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2RHQ6LVr-w) from Clayton Candle Co is a good place to start for candlemaking. You’ll also want to check out [r/candlemaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/candlemaking/), especially their [equipment list](https://www.reddit.com/r/candlemaking/wiki/guide/starting_equipment/), [walkthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/candlemaking/wiki/guide/walkthrough/), and [troubleshooting FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/candlemaking/wiki/guide/faq/). You can also find inspiration and ideas at [r/candles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Candles/)!

[Soaping 101](https://www.youtube.com/@soaping101) on youtube has thousands of video tutorials and lots of great information for beginner soap makers. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr_YF9AaZRqj8bJwX3wwie3-p6bRpkbQC) by Bramble Berry also covers much of what you’ll need to know to get started. [RoyaltySoaps](https://www.youtube.com/@RoyaltySoaps), whose food-shaped candle tutorial we linked above, is a fantastic youtube channel for candle and soap making that features loads of in-depth tutorials, guides, and more. I highly recommend her video on [making custom molds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGNQtVjqSS4), which is super helpful if you’re looking to make shaped soaps or candles for the event.

Both soap and candle making can be a bit intimidating for beginners - if you’re completely new to it, you may be able to find classes you can take offered by local art or community centers, soap or candle shops, or local candle/soap makers that’ll help you get started.

As with any craft project, [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) is a great place to look for inspiration and detailed project tutorials - search for the specific thing you want to make or browse by category to get some ideas.

For more detailed instruction, never underestimate your local library. There are many excellent books written about tea blending, as well as perfume, soap, and candle making that can be acquired quickly and for free in physical or ebook form. Librarians are your friends and will not bite you - ask them for help in finding books and resources! Many libraries in larger cities offer additional resources such as 3D printing and laser cutting, or a ‘library of things’ where you can rent tools and crafting equipment.

If you find any tutorials or guides helpful when making art for the event, please show the creator some love and leave a comment!

**What to avoid:**

Be very careful on pinterest, tiktok, and youtube shorts - avoid ‘5 minute crafts’ style “whoa, it really works!” videos and other clickbait-y content designed to trick you. Many of these videos are deliberately short, sped-up, feature deceptive cuts, and recommend techniques that are both ineffective and potentially dangerous. These are often made by content farms, not individuals, and their goal is clicks and views, not to help people make anything real. When looking for instructional content, look for guides and videos made by dedicated individuals. A good tutorial will usually be longer, include lists of materials and resources, and show the full process with tips and tricks to ensure your success.

**Additional notes:**

Be sure to follow any safety guidelines listed on materials such as oils, chemicals, and lye. Use recommended protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and safety glasses. Work in a well-ventilated area and don’t use hazardous materials in ways not recommended on the packaging. Be very careful with any blades and other sharp equipment, and anything involving heat or fire. If you’re on the younger side, get an adult to help with anything hazardous!

**Adagio and other commercial sites:** 

To avoid being mistaken for a scammer, if you are creating your tea blends or perfumes on any kind of commercial website like Adagio, please do not share the link in your comment to the author or your art post. Include images of the blend, your illustrations, and/or descriptions instead. Please do not share any commercial links on posts directly associated with the event. If you would like to share links to anything you’re creating for sale either by you or a commercial site, please post these separately and without fanart frenzy tags. If the author or anyone else asks for the link, you are welcome to share it with them privately.

These are the best ones I found just scrolling for like an hour today. Most of them were made in hungary and we call them kotyogo I don't really know what it means but I know it's a hungarian slang.
Ik the ones on pics 5-8 don't look like regular moka pots but I think they can be classified as one because the all use steam to push the water through the coffee.
I am actually gonna pick up the first one the sport presso as it's called because I manly use my moka pots while hiking or adventure riding on my motorcycle, it's a complete set it's just a little dirty and the seal is missing so no big problem. But I am so excited i finally found one complete because these one are actually quite rare and even more rare complete and the seller wants only 20€ for it!!! I will post more about it when I get it.
The last one is called a ftm unipress there is a lot of them for sale rn but this one the nicest one and it costs only 15€. It's interesting because it almost looks like a manual flair espresso machine but on the back it has a cable that you plug in and it heats the water, the only difference is that the water is above the coffee but still is pushed through by the steam.

“So he died in that fire right” May said, her voice low as she leaned back in the booth.

“That’s what they say,” Sarah replied. She flipped open her notebook and clicked her pen. “Let’s lay out a timeline again.”

Sarah and May had lived in this town their entire lives. They went to the same schools, sat through the same church services, made the same friends, and grew up hearing the same stories whispered at sleepovers and repeated at bonfires. One story had always been there, constant and unchanging in spirit if not in detail. The silk leather witch. They had heard it so many times they could almost recite it from memory.

The story shifted depending on who told it. When they were little she lived in a well. When they were in their early teens the well had turned into a house in the woods. Sometimes there was a barn. Sometimes a workshop. Sometimes you were cursed just for looking at it. But everyone agreed on one thing. For the last three hundred years the witch had been kept at bay by salt. People said the town even employed workers whose only job was to make sure the barrier was never broken. But some say that the salt circle is no more.   

“So,” Sarah said, already writing, “early seventeen hundreds. The silk leather witch is caught selling clothes and goods made from the skin of townspeople.”

May smiled faintly. “Super cheap though.”

Sarah wanted to smile but didn’t.  
“Then she was hanged, burned, and thrown into a well,” she said, her pen scratching across the page. “And the town secretly kept watch to make sure she never got out.”

May took a slow sip of her coffee. “Uh huh,” she said, her tone lightly sarcastic. “Right.”

Sarah pressed on. “And then, what, fifteen years ago after everyone had more or less agreed it was just an old urban legend, the town starts hearing about a company that’s routinely pouring salt around a house in the middle of the woods.”

“More like ten years ago I think” May said. “I remember hearing about it for the first time. It scared the hell out of me.”

Sarah opened her mouth to ask another question, but May cut in first.

“Did you ever go out there and kick the salt circle?” May asked, smiling.

“No. Definitely not,” Sarah replied immediately. “Did you?”

“No,” May said, then hesitated. “But I always wanted to see it. I just never worked up the nerve to actually go.”

Sarah nodded, then flipped to a fresh page in her notebook. “Okay. So then the house and a large chunk of the surrounding woods catch fire. No clear cause. Something like a hundred acres burned.”

“My dad is convinced it was the development company,” May said. “He says after twenty years of stalled plans they finally got tired of fighting and decided to clear the land themselves. Figured people would stop defending the woods if there weren’t any left.”

“That feels like a stretch,” Sarah said.

“You’re right,” May replied dryly. “It’s much more reasonable that a witch escaped and burned everything to the ground.”

Sarah rolled her eyes but kept writing. “The house burned down last year, right?”

“Yeah,” May said, her voice quieter this time. “And that’s when Hutch died” She added

“Well,” Sarah said, continuing to write, her pen slowing slightly. “He was never found, but he is presumed dead I think.”

May leaned back and stared into her coffee for a moment. “Who do you think posted his journal online?” she asked. “Do you actually believe it was his?”

Sarah hesitated. The café was quiet enough that the scrape of her pen against the paper sounded louder than it should have. “I honestly have no idea,” she said. “It reads like something someone would fake, but there are parts that feel too specific. Too personal.”

“Like he wasn’t writing for anyone else,” May said softly.

“Exactly,” Sarah replied. “And if someone else found it, why post it at all? Why not turn it over to the police, or the family, or anyone?”

May frowned. “What if it was Murph”.

Sarah stopped writing. “The supervisor guy”

“Yeah” May said. “Think about it. Hutch writes about him a lot. Not in a bad way either. He says Murph respected the town. Respected how hard people fought to keep the woods from getting bulldozed.”

“That doesn’t mean he posted the journal” Sarah said, though she did not sound convinced.

“No but it gives him a motive” May replied. “The company stalls for years. Everyone fights them. Then suddenly the woods burn. The house burns. Hutch disappears. And somehow his journal ends up online.”

Sarah frowned. “You think Murph took it”

“I think Murph might have been the only one who could” May said. “He had access. He knew Hutch was writing everything down. And if the company really did burn the land to force development through…” She trailed off.

“…then posting the journal would be a way to make sure people never forgot” Sarah finished.

“Or a way to make sure no one ever touched that land again” May added. “You read the comments when the journal first went up. People were terrified. Urban explorers started showing up. Forums blew up. The place became a hive of activity.”

Sarah slowly nodded. “Hutch did say Murph respected the townspeople. He understood why people wanted to protect the woods.”

“Exactly” May said. “Burn the land and take Hutch with it, and Murph makes sure the story survives. Not just the fire. Not just the disappearance. The witch. The salt. The house. All of it.”

Sarah looked back down at her notes. “So either Murph exposed everything out of spite” she said, “or he was trying to warn people.”

Sarah wrote down their discussion, but something didn’t sit right with her. The company’s desire to finally clear the land for development was one thing, but including Hutch in the story seemed unnecessary. Maybe he was just an unfortunate byproduct, she thought, but she wasn’t fully convinced.

“Were you able to actually find out who Murph or John were?” Sarah asked.

“Not even close,” May replied.

“Yeah, we might have some luck tracking down Murph, but there’s no way we can figure out who John really was. Hutch never even met him,” Sarah explained.

“Well, he went to meet him at the house at the end of his journal,” May said confidently.

“That wasn’t John, May,” Sarah said firmly.

“What?” May exclaimed. “Then who was it?”

“The witch,” Sarah whispered, leaning in slightly, as if she feared someone might overhear.

“Do you actually believe the witch is real, Sarah?” May asked, her tone skeptical but curious.

“Do you not?” Sarah shot back, her eyes narrowing.

May was taken aback. She had always enjoyed the creepy lore and the folktale atmosphere of the journal, but she believed that Hutch’s story was ultimately about a conspiracy and a company willing to do anything to move forward with their development plans. Meanwhile, Sarah was certain that the witch was real. In her mind, Hutch had been lured to the house by the witch herself, who had taken on the guise of John. She believed he had unknowingly broken the very barrier that had kept the witch dormant for centuries, and that the dark consequences he faced were the result of crossing a force far older and far more malevolent than any human adversary.

“Shall we read through the journal again and highlight any inconsistencies?” Sarah asked, breaking the short, tense silence that had settled between them.

“Why don’t we just go there,” May said sharply, her tone leaving no room for argument.

“Go to the house?” Sarah exclaimed, her eyes wide. “Surely there would be tons of security.”

“Yeah, maybe at the front gate, but I’m not suggesting we go in through the front,” May replied, a spark of determination in her voice.

“Is it still a crime scene?” Sarah asked, hoping the thought of legal trouble might slow May down a little.

“I think this is our logical next step,” May said bluntly. “We’ve gotten nowhere trying to track down the coffee shop he went to, it’s definitely not the one we’re in now” She said in reference to an awkward conversation they had with the barista when the entered the Café “ We have no idea who Murph is, no idea who John is, and we’ve gotten nowhere with the company.”

Sarah hesitated, then added, “We did find that obituary online that listed one of the guys’ professions as a salt tender.”

“That could just mean he laid down salt in the winter, Sarah” May said, shrugging slightly, though her eyes gleamed with purpose. “We should go check it out. No more waiting. It’s time to see it for ourselves.”

They agreed to go to Salt House in person the following day, though the decision settled very differently on Sarah than it did on May. The more Sarah researched the place, the more it felt less like an investigation and more like an invitation she had already accepted without realizing it. Every detail she uncovered seemed to pull her a little closer, as if learning about Salt House was not a passive act but something that noticed her in return. There was an uncomfortable sense that by digging into the story she was not uncovering history, but instead falling for some supernatural bait that was luring her towards a terrible end.

Sarah woke at 2:30 a.m. without warning. There had been no dream, no noise to jolt her awake, just a sudden and complete awareness of the dark. The house was silent in that way only sleeping homes can be, heavy and unmoving. Sleep refused to return. Her thoughts kept circling back to the journal, to Simon Hutchinson’s final entries, to what his last moments might have been like inside that house. The thought lodged itself in her chest and would not let go.

Sarah was twenty, the same age as May, and like May she still lived with her parents. Their house was typical for the area, modest in size but surrounded by land. Nearly forty acres stretched out behind it, dissolving into thick woods that no one really used anymore. She sat up in bed and stared out the rear window, letting her eyes adjust to the darkness.

That was when she saw the light.

It was faint at first, almost easy to dismiss, a pale glow tucked deep among the trees. Her first instinct was to ignore it. There was nothing back there. No roads, no structures, nothing but forest. But the longer she stared, the more the shape resolved itself. The light was not round or scattered like a reflection. It was sharp. Square. A window.

Sarah’s breath caught as the realization settled in. The trees beyond her window did not shift or sway. There was no wind, no rustling leaves, no movement at all. The light did not flicker or pulse. It simply existed, steady and deliberate, as if it had always been there and she was only just now being permitted to notice it. The longer she stared, the more it felt like the light was not illuminating the darkness so much as pressing against it.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, the sudden vibration making her flinch.

Hey are you awake.  
The text was from May.

Sarah’s eyes snapped back to the window. The light was gone. The trees were dark again, a solid wall of black. She blinked hard and rubbed her eyes, her heart still pounding. Maybe she had been half asleep. Maybe her mind was filling in shapes that were not really there. She typed back a single word.

Yes.

Her phone rang almost immediately. She answered it without thinking and whispered, “May, everything ok?”

“I’m fine,” May replied, her voice low and tense, matching Sarah’s tone. “I just had the craziest dream.”

Sarah sat very still as May spoke. She described walking through the woods toward a house with only one window lit. Every other window was completely black, like empty sockets, but that one square of light glowed unnaturally bright. In the dream she kept walking closer, step by step, until she was maybe twenty feet away. That was when the light began to flicker. Just faintly at first. Then it went out completely.

May paused for a moment before continuing. She said she stood there staring at the dark window, waiting for her eyes to adjust. Slowly, a shape began to form inside. A silhouette that felt wrong somehow. As if it had been there the entire time, watching her, waiting for her to be close enough to see it.

“And then I woke up,” May said quietly. “It freaked me out so bad I had to call you.”

Sarah swallowed hard. She considered telling May about the light she had seen outside her own window, about how real it had looked, how impossible it was. But the words caught in her throat. Saying it out loud felt like making it real. Instead she forced a small laugh that did not sound convincing even to her.

“Do you think,” Sarah said carefully, “that maybe we should hold off on visiting the house tomorrow?”

There was a brief pause on the line. Then May scoffed.

“Hell no,” she said. “Eight am on the dot. I’ll be there. You’re not going to bail on me, right?”

“No,” Sarah replied, though the word felt heavy. “I’ll be there.”

“You better be,” May said, trying to sound playful. “If you’re not there, I’m going in alone.”

“I’ll be there,” Sarah said again, managing a small smile that May could not see.

They hung up a moment later. Sarah sat in the dark for a long time before finally glancing at her alarm clock. The red numbers glowed softly.

2:42 am.

She lay back down, fully expecting sleep to be impossible, but it came quickly and without warning, like being pulled under water.

When Sarah woke again, sunlight filled her room. She sat up abruptly, a sharp feeling of panic blooming in her chest. Her eyes went straight to the clock.

9:18 am.

For a moment she did not move at all. Then the dread set in, slow and absolute. She was already too late.

Sarah called May again and again while driving toward the site, each unanswered call made her chest feel slightly tighter. She told herself that May had probably been stopped by security or turned around at the gate but that thought died the moment she reached the pull off.

The gates were wide open.

The heavy chain that once sealed them lay coiled in the dirt like something discarded in a hurry. Signs promising future development still hung crookedly from the fencing, their bright colors faded and blistered by heat. Sarah and May had driven past this place more times than either of them could count, always slowing, always staring, never once daring to touch the gate. Now it stood open as if inviting her in.

Sarah drove through.

Trees closed in on her almost immediately, their blackened trunks leaning inward, crowding the road. The air grew thick and gritty, and then just as suddenly the forest fell away. The land opened into a vast hollow, a dead canvas carved out of the woods. Trees stood at the perimeter like a burned audience, while the interior was nothing but ash and ruin. The ground was scorched and uneven, littered with collapsed trunks and charcoal debris. It looked like something had been scooped out of the earth and never put back.

She slowed when she saw the concrete slab.

This had to be it HQ she thought. What remained of it was surrounded by warped piping, cracked ceramic, and half melted fixtures that had resisted the fire longer than everything else. The house came into view beyond it, and Sarah felt her stomach drop.

It was still standing.

The structure looked like it had been dipped in soot. Jet black and skeletal, its walls bowed and uneven, its windows empty. It no longer looked like a house so much as the idea of one, a crooked outline refusing to collapse. Fine particulates hung in the air, and a heavy fog pressed low against the ground, dark and unmoving. It was not even ten in the morning, but the light here felt like ten at night. Even the sun did not wish to visit this place.

May’s car was nowhere to be seen.

Sarah stepped out of her vehicle and immediately began to cough. The air burned her lungs. It was thin and suffocating, like she was breathing at the top of a mountain. Her hand stayed on the open car door as she shouted May’s name. Then screamed it. The sound was swallowed almost instantly, smothered by the fog and the dead space around her.

“May it’s me,” she called, her voice breaking. “It’s Sarah. Are you in there?”

Her mind betrayed her. Images rose of a burned figure twisting in agony. Skin split and blackened. A body that refused to die. Hung. Burned. Thrown screaming into a dry well. Sarah found herself hoping she would hear nothing, more than that she prayed that May had never made it this far.

Then a voice answered.

“Sarah.”

It was faint. Strained. Barely carried on the wind.

Sarah froze.

“May?” she shouted. “Is that you?”

“Yes,” the voice came back. “It’s me, Sarah. It’s May.”

The wind picked up suddenly, whistling through the empty windows of the house, tearing at the fog. The voice grew harder to hear, stretched thin like it was being pulled through something narrow. Tears blurred Sarah’s vision as she shouted again.

“Where are you?”

There was a pause. Just long enough to feel intentional.

“I need help,” the voice said. “I’m stuck.”

Sarah’s blood turned cold.

Stuck.

The word echoed in her head, colliding with the pages of the journal she had read and reread. John had said the same thing. Hutch had written it down. The pattern was far too familiar.

The voice came again, calmer now. Flat. It didn’t sound robotic as much as it sounded rehearsed.

“I fell down the stairs.”

Sarah felt bile rise in her throat.

She could not do this. She could not become the next line in the timeline they had been building. The next name spoken in past tense. Without thinking she slammed the car door shut, hands shaking as she fumbled with the ignition. The engine roared to life and she sped back down the road, gravel spraying behind her.

The wind battered the car as she drove, rocking it hard enough to make her swerve. And over it all, she swore she could hear screaming. Not carried by the wind, but woven into it, stretched and distorted, as if the land itself were crying out.

She did not stop until she reached the main road.

With trembling hands Sarah called May again. No answer. She called again. Still nothing.

Finally Sarah gave up and called the police.

It took days of questioning, though in Sarah’s memory it stretched and felt almost endless, as if time itself had been burned. She sat beneath buzzing fluorescent lights, repeating the same sentences to different faces, trying to explain why she had fled from the sound of her best friend crying out for help. Saying the words out loud made them sound absurd even to her. A witch. An imitation. A voice that was perfect and wrong at the same time. She watched the officers exchange glances, their pens slowing, their questions softening in a way that felt worse than accusation.

They told her they searched the property. Sarah nodded, but she did not believe them. She had been pulled away as soon as they arrived, guided gently but firmly away. never allowed to see what they saw. When she asked if anyone went inside the house, they said a hazmat team entered the following day and found nothing but the burned shell everyone already knew about. No stairs. No body. No sign that anyone had ever called out her name. The answer felt polished.

She spoke to May’s family more times than she could count, sitting at their kitchen table, answering the same questions she asked herself every night. She explained the journal, the research, the house, the theory that now sounded like madness in daylight. A missing persons case was opened, one of many that year, another name added to a growing list. Sarah searched anyway. She organized. She spoke. She drove back roads and hiked tree lines all to no avail. Years passed, but the memory of the last conversation she had with May never dulled. What if it really had been her. What if fear of a story had cost her best friend her own life.

The world continued in the way it always does, indifferent and relentless. Sarah grew older. She had children, May, James and Danny. For a while the past stayed where it belonged. Then, every so often, she would wake at 2:30 in the morning for no reason at all, her heart already racing before her eyes opened. She would sit up in bed and look out into the dark, and somewhere far beyond her yard, beyond the trees, a single square of light would be waiting.

At first she told herself it was exhaustion or stress. But the light never flickered. It never waivered. It simply was and as the years wore on the light took something from Sarah every time she saw it. She felt something inside her thinning, drying out, turning brittle. Memory and guilt and fear hollowed her slowly, patiently, until one morning she realized her mind felt exactly like that house in the woods. Burned hollow. Twisted.

1pz1kpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1pz1kpp/dealing_with_a_noncollegial_department_slac/,Dealing with a Non-Collegial Department (SLAC),"I'm in my second year of a tenure track position at a SLAC (STEM field, if that matters) and I've been struggling to come to terms with how isolating the department culture feels.

No one is mean or toxic as such, but there’s almost no sense of collegiality. People don’t have coffee or lunch together, there's almost no conversations in the corridors, and we seem to have maybe one department meeting per year. I think I'm the only one in the department who spends all day on campus - everyone else comes in to teach and then leaves. Most days I don't see another member of the department at all.

When I started, there was essentially no onboarding at all. Pretty much just shown to my office and left to it. No one made any effort to integrate me into the department or even explain how things typically work. Like I say, I don't think this was intentionally hostile, everyone probably just thought that someone else would do it and maybe I slipped through the cracks. I value collegiality very highly, and I've loved the feeling of community at other colleges I've worked at, so I've pretty much decided that this place isn't for me, and I plan to apply to jobs elsewhere. I'm just so surprised by how isolating this one is.

In other jobs I've always been very social and was often the one to set up regular group coffee with other the young faculty members, and I've thought about trying to initiate things here, but at this point I still feel like an outsider waiting to be invited in, and I’m not sure the new person is really the best one to change the department culture.

Has anyone else had this experience, especially at a SLAC? Did it improve over time, or did you just end up leaving? ",11,1767050488.0,Professors,21,0.87,False
1pz1kdc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pz1kdc,My epic 2025 fragrance summary after sampling 400+ fragrances,"At the end of 2024 I decided to go on a fragrance journey to curate a collection. Prior to this I wore PDM Valaya and Delina la Rosee, Le Labo Another 13 + Bergamote 22, The Noir 29, and a lot of Oil Perfumery oils.

It’s worth noting through this process I no longer enjoy Another 13 on my skin, Delina in any version, or Valaya. 

Somewhere along the way this turned into having a fragrance sample library of sorts (this is a wicked hobby for an analytical mind lol), and I match my friends and family and give them samples to free up some space.

I usually wear samples around the house since I mainly work from home, during my nighttime wind down, or on errands. 

This year I was just trying to get familiar with a wide array of things new and old. I don’t intend to continue at this pace and next year I’ll likely focus on discovery sets from indie brands and the occasional new release that spark my curiosity.

Sites where I typically buy samples/decants: Twisted Lily, ScentSplit, Perfumology, Ministry of Scent, ZGO Perfumery, and directly from the brand.

Occasionally DecantX or Fragrance Navaeh

Over 400 samples (mostly niche and indie) + 4 store smelling adventures later here are my thoughts.

Things Learned:

1. Redundancy exists in the niche space as well

2. Gourmands are more than cake and cookie scents 

3. I actually do enjoy vanilla fragrances, just depends on the approach. I’ve never been a fan of cloying or cupcake-y scents, even in candles so I came in biased. I’ve found so many deep/resinous/ambery/boozy vanillas that I love

4. Scents are completely subjective, trust my own nose and what I like (YMMV)

5. Don’t get wrapped up in online fragrance hype and discourse (compliment getters, “needing” #x layers of products, super projection, etc.) 

6. There’s no need to be in a hurry, I might love it today, but I could be indifferent in a month. I haven’t experienced a limited edition or discontinued fragrance yet to challenge this 

Personal Guardrails:

1. No blind buying, ever

2. At least 2-3 full wear tests before buying a larger size

3. Must like all phases of the fragrance to progress to a larger size, example: the first 30 minutes of Initio Side Effect are awful to me, then for about 2 hours something lovely happens before I start hating it again, so I didn’t buy a larger size

4. No 100ml bottles unless I cannot find a smaller size, and prioritize travel sizes for practicality due to wanting a wide variety of fragrances. If I adore a fragrance sample and know 9-15ml will go quickly, 30-50 is the goal.

5. If a fragrance smells similar to something I already own I’ll wear one on each arm to see if it makes sense to have both (different mood, density, similar opening but different dry down, etc.)

I’ve logged all my samples, bottles I’ve purchased, wishlist fragrances, and fragrances graduating from travel size to a larger bottle in Parfumo.

I have 68 fragrances total in my collection. 12  bottles 30ml or higher, and the remainder are 5-20ml. I have one 100ml bottle.

If you find your inbox empty in these early hours, do not sit idle ... use that time productively to dive into financial news and research industry trends. When the morning assignments begin to flow from the first-year analysts,  have a notepad ready to take thorough notes. Do not hesitate to ask questions upfront to avoid making incorrect assumptions. As you execute, your mantra must be speed and precision. Triple-check every output because meticulous attention to detail is an absolute imperative in IB. If you get stuck, do not spend hours spinning your wheels before seeking guidance from a fellow intern or analyst.

Midday in the office is rarely about long breaks. Lunch is usually quick and functional eaten at your desk while monitoring your inbox. Responsiveness will define how FT colleagues will perceive you so aim to acknowledge every email within a fifteen-minute window. This builds the trust necessary for seniors to delegate more complex work to you later in the summer. You will inevitably be tasked with unglamorous duties like ordering team dinner or binding pitchbooks. Approach this muck work with an unwavering positive attitude and a can-do spirit. Senior bankers value a helpful demeanor over technical brilliance if it comes with a complaining attitude. Your goal is to be likable and approachable so that colleagues want to invest time in mentoring you.

The evening routine involves remaining at your desk until at least 11:00 PM or until the last analyst you support has departed. Before you leave, always check in to see if any last-minute assistance is required. Use these long hours to build your internal network by requesting brief coffee chats with senior professionals when their schedules allow. 

This ten-week audition is your chance to prove you are a de-risked candidate who can handle the intensity of the career. Converting your internship into a FT offer is not about being the smartest person in the room. It's about being the most reliable, the most coachable and the most professional.

“So he died in that fire right” May said, her voice low as she leaned back in the booth.

“That’s what they say,” Sarah replied. She flipped open her notebook and clicked her pen. “Let’s lay out a timeline again.”

Sarah and May had lived in this town their entire lives. They went to the same schools, sat through the same church services, made the same friends, and grew up hearing the same stories whispered at sleepovers and repeated at bonfires. One story had always been there, constant and unchanging in spirit if not in detail. The silk leather witch. They had heard it so many times they could almost recite it from memory.

The story shifted depending on who told it. When they were little she lived in a well. When they were in their early teens the well had turned into a house in the woods. Sometimes there was a barn. Sometimes a workshop. Sometimes you were cursed just for looking at it. But everyone agreed on one thing. For the last three hundred years the witch had been kept at bay by salt. People said the town even employed workers whose only job was to make sure the barrier was never broken. But some say that the salt circle is no more.   

“So,” Sarah said, already writing, “early seventeen hundreds. The silk leather witch is caught selling clothes and goods made from the skin of townspeople.”

May smiled faintly. “Super cheap though.”

Sarah wanted to smile but didn’t.  
“Then she was hanged, burned, and thrown into a well,” she said, her pen scratching across the page. “And the town secretly kept watch to make sure she never got out.”

May took a slow sip of her coffee. “Uh huh,” she said, her tone lightly sarcastic. “Right.”

Sarah pressed on. “And then, what, fifteen years ago after everyone had more or less agreed it was just an old urban legend, the town starts hearing about a company that’s routinely pouring salt around a house in the middle of the woods.”

“More like ten years ago I think” May said. “I remember hearing about it for the first time. It scared the hell out of me.”

Sarah opened her mouth to ask another question, but May cut in first.

“Did you ever go out there and kick the salt circle?” May asked, smiling.

“No. Definitely not,” Sarah replied immediately. “Did you?”

“No,” May said, then hesitated. “But I always wanted to see it. I just never worked up the nerve to actually go.”

Sarah nodded, then flipped to a fresh page in her notebook. “Okay. So then the house and a large chunk of the surrounding woods catch fire. No clear cause. Something like a hundred acres burned.”

“My dad is convinced it was the development company,” May said. “He says after twenty years of stalled plans they finally got tired of fighting and decided to clear the land themselves. Figured people would stop defending the woods if there weren’t any left.”

“That feels like a stretch,” Sarah said.

“You’re right,” May replied dryly. “It’s much more reasonable that a witch escaped and burned everything to the ground.”

Sarah rolled her eyes but kept writing. “The house burned down last year, right?”

“Yeah,” May said, her voice quieter this time. “And that’s when Hutch died” She added

“Well,” Sarah said, continuing to write, her pen slowing slightly. “He was never found, but he is presumed dead I think.”

May leaned back and stared into her coffee for a moment. “Who do you think posted his journal online?” she asked. “Do you actually believe it was his?”

Sarah hesitated. The café was quiet enough that the scrape of her pen against the paper sounded louder than it should have. “I honestly have no idea,” she said. “It reads like something someone would fake, but there are parts that feel too specific. Too personal.”

“Like he wasn’t writing for anyone else,” May said softly.

“Exactly,” Sarah replied. “And if someone else found it, why post it at all? Why not turn it over to the police, or the family, or anyone?”

May frowned. “What if it was Murph”.

Sarah stopped writing. “The supervisor guy”

“Yeah” May said. “Think about it. Hutch writes about him a lot. Not in a bad way either. He says Murph respected the town. Respected how hard people fought to keep the woods from getting bulldozed.”

“That doesn’t mean he posted the journal” Sarah said, though she did not sound convinced.

“No but it gives him a motive” May replied. “The company stalls for years. Everyone fights them. Then suddenly the woods burn. The house burns. Hutch disappears. And somehow his journal ends up online.”

Sarah frowned. “You think Murph took it”

“I think Murph might have been the only one who could” May said. “He had access. He knew Hutch was writing everything down. And if the company really did burn the land to force development through…” She trailed off.

“…then posting the journal would be a way to make sure people never forgot” Sarah finished.

“Or a way to make sure no one ever touched that land again” May added. “You read the comments when the journal first went up. People were terrified. Urban explorers started showing up. Forums blew up. The place became a hive of activity.”

Sarah slowly nodded. “Hutch did say Murph respected the townspeople. He understood why people wanted to protect the woods.”

“Exactly” May said. “Burn the land and take Hutch with it, and Murph makes sure the story survives. Not just the fire. Not just the disappearance. The witch. The salt. The house. All of it.”

Sarah looked back down at her notes. “So either Murph exposed everything out of spite” she said, “or he was trying to warn people.”

Sarah wrote down their discussion, but something didn’t sit right with her. The company’s desire to finally clear the land for development was one thing, but including Hutch in the story seemed unnecessary. Maybe he was just an unfortunate byproduct, she thought, but she wasn’t fully convinced.

“Were you able to actually find out who Murph or John were?” Sarah asked.

“Not even close,” May replied.

“Yeah, we might have some luck tracking down Murph, but there’s no way we can figure out who John really was. Hutch never even met him,” Sarah explained.

“Well, he went to meet him at the house at the end of his journal,” May said confidently.

“That wasn’t John, May,” Sarah said firmly.

“What?” May exclaimed. “Then who was it?”

“The witch,” Sarah whispered, leaning in slightly, as if she feared someone might overhear.

“Do you actually believe the witch is real, Sarah?” May asked, her tone skeptical but curious.

“Do you not?” Sarah shot back, her eyes narrowing.

May was taken aback. She had always enjoyed the creepy lore and the folktale atmosphere of the journal, but she believed that Hutch’s story was ultimately about a conspiracy and a company willing to do anything to move forward with their development plans. Meanwhile, Sarah was certain that the witch was real. In her mind, Hutch had been lured to the house by the witch herself, who had taken on the guise of John. She believed he had unknowingly broken the very barrier that had kept the witch dormant for centuries, and that the dark consequences he faced were the result of crossing a force far older and far more malevolent than any human adversary.

“Shall we read through the journal again and highlight any inconsistencies?” Sarah asked, breaking the short, tense silence that had settled between them.

“Why don’t we just go there,” May said sharply, her tone leaving no room for argument.

“Go to the house?” Sarah exclaimed, her eyes wide. “Surely there would be tons of security.”

“Yeah, maybe at the front gate, but I’m not suggesting we go in through the front,” May replied, a spark of determination in her voice.

“Is it still a crime scene?” Sarah asked, hoping the thought of legal trouble might slow May down a little.

“I think this is our logical next step,” May said bluntly. “We’ve gotten nowhere trying to track down the coffee shop he went to, it’s definitely not the one we’re in now” She said in reference to an awkward conversation they had with the barista when the entered the Café “ We have no idea who Murph is, no idea who John is, and we’ve gotten nowhere with the company.”

Sarah hesitated, then added, “We did find that obituary online that listed one of the guys’ professions as a salt tender.”

“That could just mean he laid down salt in the winter, Sarah” May said, shrugging slightly, though her eyes gleamed with purpose. “We should go check it out. No more waiting. It’s time to see it for ourselves.”

They agreed to go to Salt House in person the following day, though the decision settled very differently on Sarah than it did on May. The more Sarah researched the place, the more it felt less like an investigation and more like an invitation she had already accepted without realizing it. Every detail she uncovered seemed to pull her a little closer, as if learning about Salt House was not a passive act but something that noticed her in return. There was an uncomfortable sense that by digging into the story she was not uncovering history, but instead falling for some supernatural bait that was luring her towards a terrible end.

Sarah woke at 2:30 a.m. without warning. There had been no dream, no noise to jolt her awake, just a sudden and complete awareness of the dark. The house was silent in that way only sleeping homes can be, heavy and unmoving. Sleep refused to return. Her thoughts kept circling back to the journal, to Simon Hutchinson’s final entries, to what his last moments might have been like inside that house. The thought lodged itself in her chest and would not let go.

Sarah was twenty, the same age as May, and like May she still lived with her parents. Their house was typical for the area, modest in size but surrounded by land. Nearly forty acres stretched out behind it, dissolving into thick woods that no one really used anymore. She sat up in bed and stared out the rear window, letting her eyes adjust to the darkness.

That was when she saw the light.

It was faint at first, almost easy to dismiss, a pale glow tucked deep among the trees. Her first instinct was to ignore it. There was nothing back there. No roads, no structures, nothing but forest. But the longer she stared, the more the shape resolved itself. The light was not round or scattered like a reflection. It was sharp. Square. A window.

Sarah’s breath caught as the realization settled in. The trees beyond her window did not shift or sway. There was no wind, no rustling leaves, no movement at all. The light did not flicker or pulse. It simply existed, steady and deliberate, as if it had always been there and she was only just now being permitted to notice it. The longer she stared, the more it felt like the light was not illuminating the darkness so much as pressing against it.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, the sudden vibration making her flinch.

Hey are you awake.  
The text was from May.

Sarah’s eyes snapped back to the window. The light was gone. The trees were dark again, a solid wall of black. She blinked hard and rubbed her eyes, her heart still pounding. Maybe she had been half asleep. Maybe her mind was filling in shapes that were not really there. She typed back a single word.

Yes.

Her phone rang almost immediately. She answered it without thinking and whispered, “May, everything ok?”

“I’m fine,” May replied, her voice low and tense, matching Sarah’s tone. “I just had the craziest dream.”

Sarah sat very still as May spoke. She described walking through the woods toward a house with only one window lit. Every other window was completely black, like empty sockets, but that one square of light glowed unnaturally bright. In the dream she kept walking closer, step by step, until she was maybe twenty feet away. That was when the light began to flicker. Just faintly at first. Then it went out completely.

May paused for a moment before continuing. She said she stood there staring at the dark window, waiting for her eyes to adjust. Slowly, a shape began to form inside. A silhouette that felt wrong somehow. As if it had been there the entire time, watching her, waiting for her to be close enough to see it.

“And then I woke up,” May said quietly. “It freaked me out so bad I had to call you.”

Sarah swallowed hard. She considered telling May about the light she had seen outside her own window, about how real it had looked, how impossible it was. But the words caught in her throat. Saying it out loud felt like making it real. Instead she forced a small laugh that did not sound convincing even to her.

“Do you think,” Sarah said carefully, “that maybe we should hold off on visiting the house tomorrow?”

There was a brief pause on the line. Then May scoffed.

“Hell no,” she said. “Eight am on the dot. I’ll be there. You’re not going to bail on me, right?”

“No,” Sarah replied, though the word felt heavy. “I’ll be there.”

“You better be,” May said, trying to sound playful. “If you’re not there, I’m going in alone.”

“I’ll be there,” Sarah said again, managing a small smile that May could not see.

They hung up a moment later. Sarah sat in the dark for a long time before finally glancing at her alarm clock. The red numbers glowed softly.

2:42 am.

She lay back down, fully expecting sleep to be impossible, but it came quickly and without warning, like being pulled under water.

When Sarah woke again, sunlight filled her room. She sat up abruptly, a sharp feeling of panic blooming in her chest. Her eyes went straight to the clock.

9:18 am.

For a moment she did not move at all. Then the dread set in, slow and absolute. She was already too late.

Sarah called May again and again while driving toward the site, each unanswered call made her chest feel slightly tighter. She told herself that May had probably been stopped by security or turned around at the gate but that thought died the moment she reached the pull off.

The gates were wide open.

The heavy chain that once sealed them lay coiled in the dirt like something discarded in a hurry. Signs promising future development still hung crookedly from the fencing, their bright colors faded and blistered by heat. Sarah and May had driven past this place more times than either of them could count, always slowing, always staring, never once daring to touch the gate. Now it stood open as if inviting her in.

Sarah drove through.

Trees closed in on her almost immediately, their blackened trunks leaning inward, crowding the road. The air grew thick and gritty, and then just as suddenly the forest fell away. The land opened into a vast hollow, a dead canvas carved out of the woods. Trees stood at the perimeter like a burned audience, while the interior was nothing but ash and ruin. The ground was scorched and uneven, littered with collapsed trunks and charcoal debris. It looked like something had been scooped out of the earth and never put back.

She slowed when she saw the concrete slab.

This had to be it HQ she thought. What remained of it was surrounded by warped piping, cracked ceramic, and half melted fixtures that had resisted the fire longer than everything else. The house came into view beyond it, and Sarah felt her stomach drop.

It was still standing.

The structure looked like it had been dipped in soot. Jet black and skeletal, its walls bowed and uneven, its windows empty. It no longer looked like a house so much as the idea of one, a crooked outline refusing to collapse. Fine particulates hung in the air, and a heavy fog pressed low against the ground, dark and unmoving. It was not even ten in the morning, but the light here felt like ten at night. Even the sun did not wish to visit this place.

May’s car was nowhere to be seen.

Sarah stepped out of her vehicle and immediately began to cough. The air burned her lungs. It was thin and suffocating, like she was breathing at the top of a mountain. Her hand stayed on the open car door as she shouted May’s name. Then screamed it. The sound was swallowed almost instantly, smothered by the fog and the dead space around her.

“May it’s me,” she called, her voice breaking. “It’s Sarah. Are you in there?”

Her mind betrayed her. Images rose of a burned figure twisting in agony. Skin split and blackened. A body that refused to die. Hung. Burned. Thrown screaming into a dry well. Sarah found herself hoping she would hear nothing, more than that she prayed that May had never made it this far.

Then a voice answered.

“Sarah.”

It was faint. Strained. Barely carried on the wind.

Sarah froze.

“May?” she shouted. “Is that you?”

“Yes,” the voice came back. “It’s me, Sarah. It’s May.”

The wind picked up suddenly, whistling through the empty windows of the house, tearing at the fog. The voice grew harder to hear, stretched thin like it was being pulled through something narrow. Tears blurred Sarah’s vision as she shouted again.

“Where are you?”

There was a pause. Just long enough to feel intentional.

“I need help,” the voice said. “I’m stuck.”

Sarah’s blood turned cold.

Stuck.

The word echoed in her head, colliding with the pages of the journal she had read and reread. John had said the same thing. Hutch had written it down. The pattern was far too familiar.

The voice came again, calmer now. Flat. It didn’t sound robotic as much as it sounded rehearsed.

“I fell down the stairs.”

Sarah felt bile rise in her throat.

She could not do this. She could not become the next line in the timeline they had been building. The next name spoken in past tense. Without thinking she slammed the car door shut, hands shaking as she fumbled with the ignition. The engine roared to life and she sped back down the road, gravel spraying behind her.

The wind battered the car as she drove, rocking it hard enough to make her swerve. And over it all, she swore she could hear screaming. Not carried by the wind, but woven into it, stretched and distorted, as if the land itself were crying out.

She did not stop until she reached the main road.

With trembling hands Sarah called May again. No answer. She called again. Still nothing.

Finally Sarah gave up and called the police.

It took days of questioning, though in Sarah’s memory it stretched and felt almost endless, as if time itself had been burned. She sat beneath buzzing fluorescent lights, repeating the same sentences to different faces, trying to explain why she had fled from the sound of her best friend crying out for help. Saying the words out loud made them sound absurd even to her. A witch. An imitation. A voice that was perfect and wrong at the same time. She watched the officers exchange glances, their pens slowing, their questions softening in a way that felt worse than accusation.

They told her they searched the property. Sarah nodded, but she did not believe them. She had been pulled away as soon as they arrived, guided gently but firmly away. never allowed to see what they saw. When she asked if anyone went inside the house, they said a hazmat team entered the following day and found nothing but the burned shell everyone already knew about. No stairs. No body. No sign that anyone had ever called out her name. The answer felt polished.

She spoke to May’s family more times than she could count, sitting at their kitchen table, answering the same questions she asked herself every night. She explained the journal, the research, the house, the theory that now sounded like madness in daylight. A missing persons case was opened, one of many that year, another name added to a growing list. Sarah searched anyway. She organized. She spoke. She drove back roads and hiked tree lines all to no avail. Years passed, but the memory of the last conversation she had with May never dulled. What if it really had been her. What if fear of a story had cost her best friend her own life.

The world continued in the way it always does, indifferent and relentless. Sarah grew older. She had children, May, James and Danny. For a while the past stayed where it belonged. Then, every so often, she would wake at 2:30 in the morning for no reason at all, her heart already racing before her eyes opened. She would sit up in bed and look out into the dark, and somewhere far beyond her yard, beyond the trees, a single square of light would be waiting.

I just froze up. I went pretty blank, I guess the term that comes to mind is catatonic, and I just sort of melted against a chair. I was trying to move my fingers, but it was like the connections weren’t connecting. I was just frozen. Incredibly slow in my head. I kept thinking “move your foot. One foot in front of the other.” But couldn’t move. I had just had coffee. I had taken a Valium, like usual, during the anger/fear part of a panic attack more than an hour before—something I’m used to—but not this overall effect. Is this something normal? Thanks.

I actually ended up choosing to lose the buffer and play cards. Foresight helped me throughout the fight to get what I needed. On the second cycle of my incense burner I played blasphemy to deal 300 in one turn and be intangible for the 999999 damage. I actually skipped playing vault twice because it would offset the intangibility for the heart attacks. My main source of block was wallop with snecko😂

I have tried to make friends by going to cute events in my city and have gotten Instagram handles, but no long lasting friendships. They either have a partner, have their own friends, or we just don't click, no bad blood though. I made a great friend at work before I promoted to a different location. She kind of just slowly stopped talking to me. (She was going through a lot but even after I made an effort to rekindle, she didn't.)

 I sometimes go out of my way to sit in coffee shops and work just to get out and be somewhere other than work and gym, I haven't made friends doing that. My 2 previous relationships ended horribly, and I honestly have no hope or interest in dating at the moment, I'm just focused on my job and building more income streams for myself. I don't have a support system in terms of family either. I do live with my parents but there is tension and they are not emotionally available. It is something they are working on which I am grateful for but I am at a point where I just cant afford to be vulnerable with them or anyone honestly. Even making this post anonymously is hard. 

I feel kind of hopeless honestly. I see people on my social media with partners, having holiday dinners with family, going out, etc. I try to not spend all my money and sometimes I don't have money to spend (mainly if it's the first of the month). I just feel so sad and alone. It would be silly to say I am the only one who experiences this but I feel like my situation is some horrible unique show. All I do is work, come home, go for a drive when I am tried of being in my room, and ruminate on my trauma from my most recent ex and situation ship. I ruminate because I have not made new memories in my life and don't have anyone to do new things with. 

I am a mentally strong person, but I have been so emotional and sad about this lately I feel like I am at my wits-end (just wanting to give up on having people in my life). I signed up for therapy, and I made a hair appointment for later this week to hopefully cheer me up.

1pz1j2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1pz1j2q/my_epic_2025_fragrance_summary_after_sampling_400/,My epic 2025 fragrance summary after sampling 400+ fragrances,"At the end of 2024 I decided to go on a fragrance journey to curate a collection. Prior to this I wore PDM Valaya and Delina la Rosee, Le Labo Another 13 + Bergamote 22, The Noir 29, and a lot of Oil Perfumery oils.

It’s worth noting through this process I no longer enjoy Another 13 on my skin, Delina in any version, or Valaya.

Somewhere along the way this turned into having a fragrance sample library of sorts (this is a wicked hobby for an analytical mind lol), and I match my friends and family and give them samples to free up some space.

I usually wear samples around the house since I mainly work from home, during my nighttime wind down, or on errands.

This year I was just trying to get familiar with a wide array of things new and old. I don’t intend to continue at this pace and next year I’ll likely focus on discovery sets from indie brands and the occasional new release that spark my curiosity.

Sites where I typically buy samples/decants: Twisted Lily, ScentSplit, Perfumology, Ministry of Scent, ZGO Perfumery, and directly from the brand.

Occasionally DecantX or Fragrance Navaeh

Over 400 samples (mostly niche and indie) + 4 store smelling adventures later here are my thoughts.

Things Learned:

1. Redundancy exists in the niche space as well
2. Gourmands are more than cake and cookie scents
3. I actually do enjoy vanilla fragrances, just depends on the approach. I’ve never been a fan of cloying or cupcake-y scents, even in candles so I came in biased. I’ve found so many deep/resinous/ambery/boozy vanillas that I love
4. Scents are completely subjective, trust my own nose and what I like (YMMV)
5. Don’t get wrapped up in online fragrance hype and discourse (compliment getters, “needing” #x layers of products, super projection, etc.)
6. There’s no need to be in a hurry, I might love it today, but I could be indifferent in a month. I haven’t experienced a limited edition or discontinued fragrance yet to challenge this

Personal Guardrails:

1. No blind buying, ever
2. If a fragrance smells similar to something I already own I’ll wear one on each arm to see if it makes sense to have both (different mood, density, similar opening but different dry down, etc.)

I’ve logged all my samples, bottles I’ve purchased, wishlist fragrances, and fragrances graduating from travel size to a larger bottle in Parfumo.

I have 68 fragrances total in my collection. 12  bottles 30ml or higher, and the remainder are 5-20ml. I have one 100ml bottle.

Favorites:

\- Byredo - Casablanca Lily

\- Fugazzi - Angel Dust Extrait

\- Iris

\- Vanilla/tonka/amber

\- Woods

\- Musk

Notes I struggle with:

\- Cardamom

\- Coconut

\- Ylang Ylang

\- Neroli

\- Tuberose

\- Aquatic/Marine and Tropical notes

\- Coffee

\- Tobacco

I’ve more or less found a least 1 fragrance that contains one of these that I like, but more times than not I don’t enjoy fragrances that heavily feature or lead with these notes

Notes that make me skip smelling a fragrance:

\- Pineapple

\- Bubblegum

\- Melon

\- Blueberry

Fragrances I refused to spray on skin:

\- Frederic Malle - Musc Ravageur (I actually want to try this again, I tried this early on and I reallyyy disliked it. I wonder if time and experience will shift my opinion)

\- Regime des Fleurs - Fleurs Eclair

\- Andrea Maack - Pavilion

\- Bianco Latte

\- Siam 1928 Fluffy Cake

1pz1ixj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1pz1ixj/westmarch_christmas_reward_what_do_i_get/,"Westmarch christmas reward, what do I get?","So I am in a living world/westmarch, and I was offered a singular item of my level (6) or lower, with GM approval.  For a christmas event.  With a deadline of Jan. 2nd.

My character that got this reward is a throwing build.  I already have a thrower's bandolier and shadow sheath, and I'm wondering what to get.

Here is a pathbuilder link, and its accurate for the build, but the gear is not accurate.  [https://pathbuilder2e.com/launch.html?build=1336843](https://pathbuilder2e.com/launch.html?build=1336843) the character is level 6.  The mining and smithing lores are used to go mining and smithing in downtimes.

Basically, I was wondering how I could optimize this gift from the christmas session.  My character already uses a boomerang, of which she crafted 3 from communal resources, so when she is not using them, anyone is free to, but one made of cold iron, silver, and a homebrew material effective against homebrew undead on the server.

This build throws stuff all the time.  Even if the enemy is 5 feet away from me.  The reason for the throwers bandolier is to use specific use case weapons, but I have yet to actually use it over just putting the specific weapon for the mission in my shadow sheath.

This character is the alchemist subclass of the investigator, so perhaps a certain potion recipe wouldn't be too crazy of an idea.

Given you could pick anything to improve this build, what would you pick?  ABP is on the server, so fundamental runes are kinda eh, do I just go for a conditional weapon for my bandolier?  Do I go for something else, such as a potion recipe?  Or is there some crazy good item for a throwing build that I am missing?  Maybe I go for a piece of specific magic item armor, since I am just wearing leather lamellar.  ~~However, I believe that would not scale with ABP.~~  I checked and everything but the property runes would scale.  You can't edit the property runes.

~~95% sure unique items are off the table, but might be good to recommend some just in case.~~

I really want to get level 7 as soon as possible, but I don't think I could get level 7 items even if I got that before Jan. 2nd.

Edit before posting:  I could either get a weapon, or a rune, but not both on the same item.  Shame...  Also unique items are not allowed either.

What's worth getting?

Things I already have: Insight coffee recipe, 3 good weapon variants.

So, I’ve been in town for now my 3rd full day as my flight home has been delayed til 4am, I am writing this as I sit at the bar enjoying. A cocktail and some food at Ostrich Club

On Saturday I had dinner at Bar Kismet, great little place, super nice vibes, the other diners on either side of me as well as the bartenders were super friendly.  No food pics as the food honestly doesn’t photograph well, how am I supposed to make a tuna melt look like anything other than a tuna melt, but damn was it tasty,  then I had the tuna tartare and the cod to finish, as well as some cocktails, Followed by the Paris brest for dessert

On Sunday I had a pastry and coffee from Pane E Circo, I also grabbed a croissant for a late night snack. before hopping on the ferry and grabbing a lobster roll from Evan’s.  Pane E circo was really good.  Evan’s wasn’t bad at all, the fries were really good, but one of my non negotiables for a lobster roll is a butter toasted bun.  The Evan’s bun almost tasted stale.  

I went to Dear friend for some oysters and a couple of cocktails before heading to Oxalis for the tasting menu.  Dear friend was great, cocktails were fantastic and again friendly bartenders and other patrons.  Oxalis was very good, but not every dish was a hit.  The tuna tataki was amazing, the brotzeit and the spreads are all great, really liked the black garlic cream cheese.  I will say the a la carte food coming from the kitchen looked amazing and I would definitely like to go back for the Schnitzel and Spaetzle. The table next to me also ordered a ton of food so I was able to see most dishes up close and the beef salad, duck croquette and halibut all looked really good also.  

Monday I woke up and grabbed an almond croissant from LF bakery and some donuts from vandal but they are for later and will be enjoyed in the airport while I wait to many hours.

I went to The Narrows for lunch and damn that place is fantastic, definitely want to go back for dinner.  Fried pepperoni is so simple yet so damn good and the bologna sandwich with kipper mayo was fantastic

Had a 4pm reso at Lou Pecou where my plan was to take an uber to the airport from there, had the garlic fingers and really enjoyed them.  I would have had more but because I was able to get a seat at Ostrich club, didn’t want to fill up to much.

Just had the scallop and the agnolotti at Ostrich Club and I think they might have been my 2 favourite bites out of everything.  So at least there was a light at the end of my long airport tunnel.

For our first date, he suggested we go for a walk, talk, and drink *mate* (he is from Argentina, so it’s a very common drink). I said yes. We walked, shared mate, talked for hours, laughed a lot, and the conversation flowed really well. The next day he texted me saying he had a great time, thanked me for the date, and said meeting me at this stage of his life felt like “the cherry on top” after a difficult year.

He shared that earlier this year he was very unhappy at his job, quit after years there, was financially helped by his parents for a while, then moved, finished his degree, and started a new job working with his brother in software development.

He invited me out again, once more, to walk and have mate. He also offered to cook dinner at his place, but I declined because I don’t know him well enough yet and suggested leaving that for later. He was respectful and understanding.

The thing is: both times we went out, we just walked and talked for hours. We didn’t eat, didn’t get coffee, didn’t get ice cream,  nothing. He hasn’t suggested even something simple like a coffee, a picnic, or grabbing a cold drink (it’s very hot where I live). He also mentioned that he moved 6 months ago and still doesn’t have a bed or chairs.

What makes this confusing is that emotionally, he’s great. He’s kind, sensitive, emotionally available, respectful, expressive, remembers everything I tell him, doesn’t push physical or sexual boundaries, and clearly enjoys spending time with me. He says he likes building good communication.

I’m independent, I have my own job, I take myself out for coffee or dinner, I buy myself things,  I don’t *need* a man to pay for me. But I do value small gestures and thoughtfulness.

I told my mom and girl friends about him, and they said that if a 34-year-old man hasn’t even invited me for a coffee or an ice cream, he’s either cheap or broke,  and that worried me. Until then, I was feeling good about getting to know him.

So now I’m wondering:  
Do I keep getting to know him and see how things develop?  
Or is this already an incompatibility, finances, or effort? We live in a very hot place, and he hasn’t suggested ice cream at least, so I’m planning to suggest ice cream this time. He doesn’t seem cheap to me, but more like someone who’s still getting back on his feet financially

1pz18mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1pz18mg/master_your_mind_how_to_improve_decisionmaking/,Master Your Mind: How to Improve Decision-Making Skills for Better Outcomes,"In an era of information overload, the average person makes thousands of decisions every day. While most are trivial, such as choosing a coffee blend, the high-stakes choices we make in our careers and personal lives define our future. Improving your decision-making isn't about being ""right"" every time; it’s about refining the process you use to conclude.

Here is a guide to the most effective, science-backed strategies to sharpen your judgment and reduce ""decision fatigue.""

**1. Recognize the Two Systems of Thinking**

To improve your choices, you must first understand how your brain processes information. Modern psychology often refers to ""Dual Process Theory,"" which suggests we have two distinct modes of thought.

System 1: Fast, instinctive, and emotional. This is your ""gut feeling.""

System 2: Slower, more deliberative, and logical.

**The Strategy**: Learn to pause. When a decision feels urgent or emotional, your System 1 is likely in the driver's seat. Forging a ""wait period"" forces your brain to engage System 2, allowing for a more analytical approach.

**Research Spotlight**: In his 2011 book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman detailed the ""Prospect Theory"" (originally published in Econometrica, 1979), which explains how cognitive biases often lead us to make irrational choices based on perceived gains or losses.

**2. Apply the ""10-10-10 Rule.**""

Emotional regulation is a cornerstone of sound judgment. When we are in the heat of a moment, our ""present self"" often prioritizes immediate comfort over long-term success.

The 10-10-10 Rule asks you to consider how you will feel about your decision in:

10 minutes

10 months

10 years

By shifting your perspective to the future, you distance yourself from temporary emotions like fear, anger, or fleeting excitement.

**3. Conduct a ""Pre-Mortem**"".

Most people perform a ""post-mortem"" to see what went wrong after a project fails. To improve decision-making, you should do this before you commit.

How to do it:

Assume the decision you are about to make has turned out to be a disaster.



Work backward to identify exactly what caused that failure.



Adjust your current plan to mitigate those specific risks.



The Benefit: This technique breaks ""groupthink"" and overconfidence by making it ""safe"" for team members to voice dissent and identify potential pitfalls.

**4. Fight Decision Fatigue**

Your ability to make high-quality choices is a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. This is known as Decision Fatigue.

Automate the mundane: Standardize your morning routine or meal plan to save mental energy for complex tasks.

Decide early: Schedule your most difficult choices for the morning when your glucose levels and mental clarity are highest.

Research Spotlight: A 2011 study by Shai Danziger titled ""Extraneous factors in judicial decisions,"" published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), found that judges were significantly more likely to grant parole at the beginning of the day or after a food break than right before a break, highlighting how physical exhaustion impacts objective judgment.

**5. Seek Diverse Perspectives (The Outsider's View)**

We are often victims of Confirmation Bias—the tendency to seek out information that supports our existing beliefs. To counter this, actively seek out ""the outsider’s view.""

Ask a colleague who isn't involved in the project for their take.

Appoint a ""Devil’s Advocate"" in meetings whose sole job is to find flaws in the prevailing logic.

**Summary Checklist for Better Decisions**

Slow down: Is this a System 1 or System 2 decision?

Check your physiology: Are you hungry, tired, or stressed?

Distance yourself: Use the 10-10-10 rule to gain perspective.

Verify facts: Are you looking for the truth, or just looking to be right?

By treating decision-making as a skill rather than a personality trait, you build a more resilient, logical, and successful life.",1,1767049654.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

Her sister and I used to be very close — weekly hangouts, girls’ time, the whole thing. One day, without explanation, she started avoiding me and acting visibly upset whenever I’m around. My girlfriend and I genuinely don’t know why.

I bought a matcha chasen and a box of Earl Grey tea with my own money. At first, she would ask before using them, which I was fine with.

Over time, the tea went from a full box to only one teabag left. This stood out because my girlfriend and I barely drink tea at all — we mostly drink coffee — so we knew it wasn’t us. My chasen was also constantly left in the sink. No one else in the house drinks tea except the three of us.

To be sure, we made a cold brew Earl Grey and left it in a tumbler in the fridge to drink the next morning. When we checked, it was gone. Her sister had taken the tumbler and later said there was “no drink inside, just a teabag,” so she washed it — even though she never uses that tumbler and has her own. When i asked the housekeeper if the chasen always being used, she said yes (and i don’t drink matcha anymore) So it was pretty clear that she uses my stuff even after avoiding me.

At that point, I felt uncomfortable. She avoids me and doesn’t speak to me, yet continues using my belongings without asking. I quietly took my tea and matcha chasen and kept them in my room. I didn’t confront her or start an argument.

So I've never really asked anyone out. I've had relationships and been married, but I was always the one approached (targeted, as my friends and family would say).

After many years of therapy and getting right with myself, I really don't have much interest in finding a partner, but I don't want to spend the entire 2nd half of my life alone because of some poor choices in my 20s.

Cut to now. I asked someone out whom I thought I hit it off with. They told me they didn't really date but liked talking to me. I took this as a polite no, but was encouraged by some friends that it was still an invitation to proceed, just slowly. Someone who knows them suggested they are a bit gun shy after their own difficult past.

So we continue to talk here and there, but it really isn't going anywhere. Like not even just romantically, the conversations just literally ""how's the weather, what are your plans this weekend?"" Type stuff. I'm wondering if my initial take was correct and they are not interested, but too polite to say so? Or, am I just so used to fast-paced love bombing relationships that I don't know what a normal one looks like?

I mean am I wrong or if you are interested, it shouldn't take days to respond, and there shouldn't be any problem meeting for at least coffee or lunch? I mean I take people out to lunch all the time and there's no expectation with it.
