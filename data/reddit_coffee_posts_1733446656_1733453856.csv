1h7r7b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h7r7b5/how_much_is_vitamix_blender/,How much is Vitamix blender?,"Hey everyone! I've been using my Vitamix blender for about two years now, and I get a lot of questions about the price and whether it's worth the investment. So, I thought I'd break down everything you need to know about Vitamix blender prices and what you get for your money.

Let's be real - Vitamix blenders aren't cheap. They typically range from $350 to $650, depending on the model and features. I remember being shocked at the price tag when I first started shopping for one. But here's the thing: they're actually worth every penny.

The entry-level models like the Explorian series start around $350. The popular Professional Series and Ascent Series usually fall between $500-$600. You can check out the current prices here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender

What makes them so expensive? First off, these things are built like tanks. My parents have had theirs for 15 years, and it still works perfectly. The motor is incredibly powerful - we're talking 2-2.3 horsepower. For comparison, most regular blenders are around 500 watts (less than 1 horsepower).

I use mine for everything:
- Smooth smoothies (no chunks!)
- Hot soups (the friction from the blades actually heats it up)
- Nut butters
- Frozen desserts
- Dough mixing
- Even grinding coffee beans

The warranty is pretty impressive too - most models come with a 7-10 year warranty. When you break down the cost over that time, it's actually pretty reasonable.

If you're interested in comparing different models and their prices, you can find the full range here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender

Some money-saving tips I've learned:
1. Watch for holiday sales
2. Consider certified reconditioned models (they're like new but cheaper)
3. Some retailers offer payment plans
4. Look for bundle deals

I know it seems like a big investment upfront, but think about it this way: if you're spending $5 on smoothies a few times a week, your Vitamix will pay for itself within a year. Plus, you're getting a machine that can replace several kitchen appliances.

When I bought mine, I actually saved money by waiting for Black Friday. The price dropped by about $100, which made the decision much easier. Now I use it almost every day, and I honestly can't imagine going back to a regular blender.

Just remember - the cheapest option isn't always the most cost-effective in the long run. I went through three cheaper blenders before finally investing in my Vitamix, and I wish I'd just bought it sooner.

Hope this helps anyone who's on the fence about making the investment! Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or features.",1,1733453163.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Had to pop the panels off to install new outer doors so figured it would be the perfect time to clean them up. I am super happy with how well the vinyl paint came out and it feels pretty durable. The arm rest I am still working on, currently printing another version of it - that will get painted to match the panel eventually. Also I will be doing a proper upholster on it, I cut a piece of wood and threw that together in about ten minutes.

1h7qzke,https://www.reddit.com/r/urticaria/comments/1h7qzke/what_worked_for_me/,What worked for me,"I suffered from chronic hives for nearly a year, despite following a highly restrictive diet that eliminated all animal proteins. I would break out daily, and even simple activities like riding a bike or walking short distances would trigger painful welts.

After working with an allergy specialist who only prescribed increasingly higher doses of antihistamines, I sought help from a naturopath. They took a holistic approach, focusing on healing my gut and identifying food sensitivities through an IgG test.

My treatment plan consisted of:

1. Eliminating all foods flagged on the IgG test
2. Supplementing with L-glutamine
3. Adding beef gelatin to my diet
4. Drinking nettle leaf tea

I also made two additional changes:

1. Avoiding coffee on an empty stomach
2. Eliminating diet soda and other acidic drinks

Over several weeks, I gradually started to feel better, and through a very restrictive diet, I was able to get my hives under control.

I've since reintroduced the eliminated foods to identify triggers. Here's what I've found:

1. Pork  products trigger my hives
2. I can tolerate eggs, but need to cut them out if I start breaking out consistently
3. Coffee and soda exacerbate my acid reflux, which can lead to new breakouts. To manage this, I need to eliminate these triggers and focus on healing and calming my body.

This journey has helped me develop a deeper appreciation for naturopathic science and for gut health.

I hope my story offers some insight and encouragement to those navigating their own health journeys. Wishing everyone health, peace, and a deeper understanding of their own unique path to wellness

Hi! Just wanted to get some advice on my situation. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 6 years. We’ve been living together for 3 years. 

In our first year of living together, he lost his job and I ended up having to cover our rent, groceries, vet bills, etc. 

In our second and third year of living together, he was also partially employed for both years. Similarly, I had to cover our rent, bills and all necessities during these times (around 4-6 months each year). I was even able to cover a nice holiday overseas where I paid for costs. 

Due to his work situation for the past couple of years, he hasn’t been able to build savings. Because I’ve been covering costs for both of us, I also had to dig into my savings at times. 

I referred him for a role in my company, and he’s been here for a couple of months now. We moved in with his parents so we pay considerably less in rent. 

He is earning a stable pay check every fortnight but struggles to save money. He says that because I earn more than him, I should be paying for more of our leisure costs. I don’t disagree with this statement as I believe we should pay things proportionately. To support this, I opened a joint account where we both get cards and contribute proportionately. He never activated his card. 

When I offer to pay for things, he will often insist that he pays, so I don’t pay for some coffees/food. 

He says that the issue lays in me not paying when he tells me he wants to pay. I said that if he doesn’t want to pay for something, then to not insist on paying. He said that I should be more considerate that he doesn’t earn as much as me/have savings and I should fight him to pay for the bill. He thinks that even though he insists to pay, I should also insist to pay because it is important to him that he offers. 

I don’t think it’s fair for him to expect me to second guess when he offers? I think that if he doesn’t want to pay, then he shouldn’t offer. 

I’ve talked to him about it but we haven’t resolved this issue. 

I’m trying to find a compromise and would appreciate some advice! How can I approach this? ",1,1733452322.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I hope the consequences of her actions hit in the face soon,"This is a tale about my fiance's friend's wedding day and the marriage that followed. So many things happened within this couple's relationship that it's just insane. These are just some points of major things that have happen. Also I don't have a problem with any of the age gaps that are given in the story. I have a problem with the lack of maturity from these people. All of our ages today to give some context: Myself (25f), my fiance(30m), groom (28m), and the bride(33f). Through this post I will be calling the bride and groom as such just to keep things easy. They met and started dating in 2021 I believe. Some of these events happened before, during, and after the wedding. I'll put it all in chronological order. 

- My fiance, the best friend and later the groom's best man, had explicitly expressed to the groom that he didn't like the bride. This was because she was such a contrast compared to the groom's personality conflicting moral values between the couple. The groom is simple, slightly autistic, and very sweet guy. The bride is about 5-6 years older than him but acts like she's only 21 and wasts to party like she's in a frat. She goes out partying and drinking every weekend without her now husband. She spends absurd amount of money and refuses to disclose with him how much she's spending. She is very self-centered. I would even describe her as an attention whore. 
- The groom is not allowed to have any privacy or secrets. The bride has to know where he is 24/7. This was even a rule back when they were dating. If she wants anything he had to respond within 5 minutes. If he didn't get back to her immediately, she freaks out and starts calling/texting him non-stop until he answered the phone. Usually she wouldn't have a good reason and just wanted his attention cause she was bored. She would claim to have a panic attack if he didn't answer on the first call and blame him for her high emotions. She always says it's because she was so stressed she couldn't reach him and thought something bad would happen. She'd say she needed him on call for her own peace of mind. (Side note: He's one of the most loyal people you'll ever meet. He's always got your back. He's never once done anything unfaithful in any relationship. He only has eyes for his wife so there's no way this could be due to past infidelity on his part. I think this is her own projection. We'll talk more about that in a minute) (Another important note: usually when she's going out drinking with friends it's not in the town we all live in. She usually drives back to her hometown which is about an hour's drive from here. She then spends the whole weekend with her friends and barely any communication with her now husband.)
- The bride expected her privacy and secrets unconditionally. She refuses to have any contact with him if she is out with her friends in any capacity. She gets frustrated and complain openly in front of their friends, family, and even strangers that he tries to text her at any point during her evening. Usually her evenings are spent out drinking with her friends and trying to get hit on by other people. She openly flirts with men at the bar. She also only wears super revealing clothing when she'd flirt with people at bars. This super low plunge neckline on a skin tight brightly colored dress. And this dress barely covers her ass. Like it slides up everytime she sits or bends. She always claimed it was because she just was trying to get free drinks to ""save money"". I don't buy it. I wouldn't flirt with somebody for free drinks if I was in a relationship with someone else. But that's just me and my morals. 

- ON TO THE WEDDING! Thier wedding took place in spring of 2023. On the wedding day, the bride refuse to communicate with anyone outside of her wedding party. She ""wanted to live in the moment and telling people what to do would kill that moment for her"". I can understand and respect that to a certain degree. However, we couldn't get a hold of her at all. At first, we had some questions about setting up decorations for the wedding and reception. She had left vague directions but it was hard to understand. Like she thought there would be more room for the number of tables she had us set up. There was no way we'd fit all the tables and chairs in the room. Very early in the morning, she began to refused any phone calls or texts from anyone. One of her bridesmaids was supposed to be the point of communication but got super intoxicated before the wedding, we think she just forgot. We would call both of them to try and get an answer out of the bride. It was so stressful and frustrating, especially when she was 45 minutes late to her own wedding with no communication! Not going to lie, I genuinely thought she stood up the groom last minute. 

-Here's some info on why the bride showed up 45 minutes late to her own wedding. She still wasn't even dressed or fully done with hair and makeup. They'd been drinking since 9am-ish. The ceremony didn't start till 3pm. Lots of champagne. She was so drunk that she was wobbling the whole time. She almost slipped in the bathroom trying to get into her dress with her BM's drunkenly giggling. She was swaying while saying her vows and I was genuinely worried she would fall over. She kept swaying slightly the whole night. These ladies also drove 30 minutes to the venue and were all intoxicated. Yikes! I'm so glad they didn't crash. They all continued to drink the rest of the night. From what I understand, they didn't have a very fun time the next morning. 

- THE BRIDE'S OBSESSION! I knew the bride had an obsession, but I didn't realize how extreme it was! She had always talked about how much she loved zebras. She had full arm and leg sleeve tattoos of penguins. Think big and bold and bright colors.  She always wears zebra on her shirts, pants, and hats. I found out about her special room. Apparently in their apartment she had designated one of the bedrooms to be her zebra room. I thought maybe she had some little toys or something in there from childhood. Nope. She has the entire second bedroom filled with zebra themed stuff. There are shelves that go from ceiling to floor on every wall full of zebra memorabilia. I'm talking stuffed animals, snow globes, coffee mugs, t-shirts, slippers, beanies, you name it. She took up an entire bedroom with all of this stuff plus a small electric piano and refused to let her now husband put anything of his in that room. I went over to their apartment for the first time and saw firsthand the zebra takeover. There were zebras throughout their entire apartment. Every throw pillow had a zebra on it. Every blanket had this animal. There were zebras on everything. 
- While at the their apartment for the first time, I also noticed the bride had several photos up. Lots of frame photos of her with her family and friends. I only saw one picture of the bride and groom together on their wedding day. All the other pictures were just of the bride and her people. If the groom hadn't been the one to open the door, I would have never guessed he even lived there. The entire apartment was decorated to her liking alone. He had one small corner in the living room next to the front door where he had his computer and some old world war II memorabilia. He likes history and historic firearms. He got one corner right next to the front door and she got the rest of the apartment. 
-She also has a bad habit of adopting animals for attention. What I mean by this is she buys exotic animals and then takes them out to the bars when she's trying to get these free drinks. She does it as a way of attention seeking. For a long time she had a big python. She would wrap this thing around her neck all times of the year and carry it around. Mind you, we also live in a state where we experience extremes of all four seasons. I'm talking negative degree weather in the winter and over 100° in the summer. This animal was constantly being paraded around. She did the same thing with a bearded dragon and with ferrets. She ended up having 3 ferrets at once plus a very poorly trained dog. This terrier mutt with a lot of energy. She'd take them all out and show them off. At the time of posting this she had eventually gotten rid of all of her reptiles, was down to only one ferret, still had this crazy dog, and decided to adopt a cat as a way to process her emotions after loosing a parent figure. I understand that people process grief in different ways. But she immediately turned around and adopted this cat  after her husband specifically said no more animals. Important note: the groom never wanted pets. He just doesn't like to have animals in the apartment. But she came with the ferrets and the dog. He did not sign up for that cat. 

- SECRET CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!! About 10 months after the wedding, the groom calls my fiance. He's upset and doesn't know what to do. The groom just had someone from a collection agency show up at their apartment stating that his new bride had large amounts of credit card debt! He didn't even know she had this credit cards! Apparently she had secret credit cards that she never told them about. She claimed she never thought it was important to tell him since they weren't combining most of their finances. She also said some she didn't use and just forgot about. That it was just sitting with all the other cards. That's why she never paid them off (I call BS btw). By this point, they each had their individual accounts and now one joint account where they would put money in to pay bills. After talking more, we later found out that she started putting less and less money in the joint account and was expecting him to cover most of their finances. She would use the money that she was hiding to go on spontaneous trips and continued bar hopping with all of her friends. I try to stay out people's personal financial decisions. But from my understanding, the groom ended up dipping into his personal savings (saving to buy a home for them) and used that to pay off her credit card debt. From what I've been told, the bride didn't have to pay any of the debt from her personal account. She had no consequences to any of her actions except for some embarrassment because people found out. But even that embarrassment was short-lived because she continues making the same financial decisions to this day. 
- at the time of writing this they have had their One year marriage anniversary. The groom has completely surrendered his account to her. Meaning she has complete control of all of their finances. He doesn't even look at it anymore. He has absolutely no idea how much money is going into the shared account to pay off bills and how much is going into savings. He has to now ask her before he can spend any money at all. This includes any groceries, clothes, necessities, fun stuff, or luxuries. He's not allowed to buy any new video games or new parts for his hobbies. Sometimes he's not even allowed to hang out with friends because it's too much gas money. However, the bride is able to spend hundreds of dollars in a week on new clothes and makeup. She is constantly posting new outfits on social media and new makeup looks. She's also posting all these different hairstyles. Things like getting banged spontaneously or getting your hair professionally braided with extensions. I looked up the beautician she goes to for these braids and they're not cheap. They are high quality but definitely not cheap. At least $500 for the braids and that's not including the brightly colored extensions that get put in. Why I point this out is cause she went through a phase where she was getting a new set of braids ever 2-4weeks. Like all new colors and patterns. This couple is basically living paycheck to paycheck mind you. 

- last point! ACCUSATIONS OF INFIDELITY! A very long story made as short as possible, the maid of honor (form the bride's wedding) broke up with her long-term boyfriend of about 5 years. Idk why. It was a messy breakup. She was about 48 while he was about 26 at the time of the wedding. Neither one handled the breakup very well. The ex-boyfriend called the groom after the breakup. He told the groom that when she'd go to her hometown, he'd see the bride leaving bars with random guys, hooking up in cars, and then coming back in to continue drinking with her friends. (The guy would often be the DD so the Bride and MOH. This way the ladies could get really drunk and not pay for an Uber). He didn't have any evidence like pictures or videos. He even admitted that he oftentimes covered for the bride so she could ""get it on"" with random dudes. The groom didn't believe any of it. He then yelled at him on the phone, hung up, and blocking him. The guy never reached out after that. The groom came over immediately after to tell my fiance and I all about this ""crazy accusation"". I felt so sick to my stomach because it honestly made sense that she would go out and cheat on him. I couldn't look him in the eye. We have tried to talk to about things like this in the past. Specifically the credit card problems as examples to her controlling nature. We've pointed out how it's super toxic how she can do whatever she wants with no accountability and he's expected to lay everything out for her and be at her beck and call. Every time we have these conversations with him he shuts us down or defends her. He claims it's not her fault and she just has this kind of personality. Or she just doesn't think things through. He basically has the view that if something were to happen it would be the other person's fault. Like his wife can do no wrong. That if she was to sleep with someone and we had proof he would find a way to blame the guy she was hooking up with. He'd find some way to justify his wife's actions and make it seem like she's innocent in all of this. He's in so deep and we can't pull him out. And before someone says I need to help out and get him out of there, he does have a history of immediately cutting people out of his life. If he doesn't like what they're saying. Saying. He's done it on many occasions for much pettier things. An example would be one time someone forgot to invite him to dinner. Like a super small group of friends going to get dinner at a BBQ chain restaurant. The groom was so salty about it. He cut the guy out of his life and has never talked to him since. He always talks about him in such an awful way. He genuinely thinks this guy is out to get him slowly because he wasn't invited to one dinner with a couple other people. The groom also wasn't even living in the same town at the time. 

It's all really unfortunate. And it's really hard for my fiance. He really wants to help his friend out and can see all these behaviors and things happening cause he's on the outside. It's just unfortunate that the groom is so dedicated that he can't see any of the red flags that are flying constantly in his face. I get that love is blind sometimes, but this is a bit much in my opinion. The groom has the capability and understanding that if this was happening to anyone else he would recognize that this was toxic behavior and a bad relationship. But because it's happening in his marriage he can't see any of it. Or if he does he's defending it and claiming ""she just doesn't know what she's doing is wrong"" or ""she'd never be like that. We have such open communication"". We're finally at a point where we're just letting them figure it out. We'll be there if the groom ever sees the light. We'll be there to support him in whatever way we can. As for the bride, we try and keep our distance from her. ",1,1733452049.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.67,False

I have in my personal life harmed myself, I have a history of cutting myself that predates schizoid disorder. I developed a practice of burning myself and hitting my head against walls while psychotic as well. I am not physically violent towards others, however, I have had horrible delusions related to great pain being inflicted on others. These delusions were political and religious in nature. They also related to traumatic events that occurred to me. I have also, all throughout my life, grappled with an invitation from evil. I know it may appear odd to refer to an idea and value as personified but from my experience it has presented as a distinct voice and feeling. I have at times been nihilistic and suicidal but there has many times been a darker path that makes itself known. I have never accepted the invitation but true evil has at times attempted to persuade me. I have fealt outside of myself (dissociated, depersoanlized, and derealized) and not in control at times since middle school and during these times the thought that I could be great at being evil has occurred. Thankfully I have never acted on these thought. I am unsettled though as this thought is so alien, unbidden, and wrong. I know there is not a direct causal relationship between schizoid and evilness but my last psychotic break resulted in horrific delusions and scenarios in my head which I believe psychosis triggered. I am so grateful for medication, community, family, and friends. They all have helped me so much, from giving me coffee, a meal, and a blanket when homeless, to psych workers listening and being empathically kind such that I have had the courage to open up.

It's ""a mellow brown infused with a sensorial and comforting warmth,"" said Pantone Color Institute vice president Laurie Pressman. 

Meant to engage multiple senses, the color should evoke a desire to dip your spoon into it, Pressman says. Inspired in part by ""little treat culture"" − a growing trend in which people punctuate their day with small pleasures like a store-bought coffee − Pressman encourages fans to ""find your mocha moment.""

The color is also a reflection of the current needs of the world as opposed to a forecast of what’s on trend. 

“The overriding theme as we went into looking for this year's color was this whole idea of harmony,"" Pressman says. As the world becomes more complex, consumers are searching for inner peace and balance, she says. A ""versatile"" light brown that can reflect both luxury and an alignment with the natural world is the perfect shade to communicate that desire.

The color is also an expansion of the neutral shades that are “genderless” and “practical,” said Pressman. “Browns fall into this. And this is a foundational shade, a versatile shade,” she adds. “This is a color that's honest. It's authentic. We believe in this. It's a color we see in nature. We know it's real.”

1h7q9hs,https://i.redd.it/1j1u2apmx45e1.jpeg,"Second Nespresso machine leaking. Would you repair, buy a new Nespresso machine or buy a different brand coffee machine?",Hi! This is my second Nespresso Vertuo machine. The first one (same model) was leaking water but it was under warranty so they shipped me a new one. I’ve had this one for about 2-3 years now and it started leaking coffee on the bottom. Nespresso said I’m no longer under warranty so it’s $65 to repair. I’m a bit saddened as this is the second faulty machine and considering Nespresso pods aren’t the cheapest I’m debating to just give up on Nespresso in general. Would you repair it? Would you replace it (some Nespresso machines are on sale for $99)? Or would you try a different brand of coffee machines? If so what brand do you recommend and why?

I convinced them it wasn’t true, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be honest about my sexuality with anyone again.","
I (21F) have known I was different since I was young. Nothing about how I present myself screams gay, and nobody knows. I grew up in San Francisco with no community pressure to suppress myself, yet I’ve always seen this thing about myself as a bad thing. I’ve never told a single person that I’m gay, but people I know have definitely seen me on tinder. Somehow, I’m ok with people finding out indirectly, but absolutely unable to say the words out loud. I can’t even admit that I’m gay to a friend I’ve known since elementary school who is gay herself. It’s a mix of shame and disgust and a lack of confidence that has created this level of repression, I think. More than anything, I’m embarrassed to be the lesbian, for this to be how people see me. I’ve never been on a date with a girl, or kissed a girl. Partly this is due to lack of opportunity, but also because of my deep fear that someone will see/find out.

4 years ago, during my senior year of high school, my mom found my reddit account because our emails were connected (no idea why, I don’t think we even realized she was still getting some of my emails on this old account) and I had gotten some random notification that took her to my Reddit. She found something that I had written about being gay. The next morning I came downstairs to her having locked the door to the living room, and when I asked her what was going on she wouldn’t answer me. I left the house to get a coffee, confused, and when I came home my parents were both sitting there waiting for me. My mom told me what she’d read and my heart dropped. I couldn’t breath. Within a minute she was screaming and crying. “Im disgusted by lesbians”. “You’re out of this house the second you graduate high school. I won’t have you living here” “I’m disgusted by you” “I can’t look at you”. On and on. My dad was crying and trying to counter her a bit, saying they loved me but falling wayyyyy short of anything but being on her side. I was sobbing. And the only words I could say through my tears were “what am I supposed to do?”. I said this again and again. Through these words, I think I was trying to express that I agreed with her. I had spent at least the past 4 years feeling disgusted with who I was, praying I was confused, horrified about what this meant for my future. And knowing I was powerless to change it. So when she expressed her disgust, all I could say was “what am I supposed to do?”.

Eventually, I escaped to my room. And somehow within the next few days I convinced my parents that I had posted what she found while at a friends house, and that the two of us had been fucking around and pretending to be gay to make fun of lesbians. They believed me, or at least wanted to believe me enough that they went with it. Still, my mom refused to leave that locked living room for 2 weeks. She couldn’t see me or speak to me, she was so disgusted with her daughter.

4 years later, this has been “forgotten”. I haven’t had any long term boyfriends, but have provided enough breadcrumbs of interested in boys to keep the pressure off. Every once in a while my mom will question me with an air of judgement or disgust if I wear something less feminine etc. And I avoid anything gay-related like the plague. Anyway, I feel that the trauma of this experience has been deeply intertwined in my mind with coming out or talking about my sexuality. When it happened, I was just beginning to work through my own self-hatred and consider that I’d come out on day. This shut that down immediately. I have never been able to get the words out to anyone. Even this summer, I told my friend (who’s also gay) that I had something to tell her the next time we were together, and that she should hold me to it because I’d be too scared probably when the time came. And yet I still couldn’t get the words out, even knowing there was no way she’d be anything but accepting. I think it’s because the fear isn’t of what she’d think, but because saying it out loud makes me the disgusting and shameful person I feel that I am. The world doesn’t hate me, I hate myself. I know this isn’t true, but my moms words have gotten to my core, and I feel too much shame to ever be who I am.",6,1733449824.0,TrueOffMyChest,9,0.88,False

Short Devotional about Servanthood

Introduction
------------

Servanthood is a beautiful journey of faith, where we serve others not because we have to, but because we want to reflect the love of Jesus in our daily lives. It is about putting others before ourselves, listening deeply, and acting with compassion. Embracing servanthood can transform our lives, relationships, and entire communities for the better. Imagine a world where life isn’t measured by what we gain but by what we give. As we explore this devotional on servanthood, let’s open our hearts to the subtle yet profound ways we can be of service to others every day.

Perhaps you’ve noticed moments when serving others has brought more joy than any personal achievement ever could. This is the magic of servanthood—it connects us deeply with others and aligns us with our higher purpose. Through this devotional, you will discover the simple yet powerful ways to embody servanthood, guided by scripture and practical steps. Together, let’s dive into the heart of what it truly means to serve.

Bible Verse
-----------

“For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” — Mark 10:45 (ESV)

Meaning
-------

In Mark 10:45, Jesus sets the ultimate example of servanthood. At the heart of His ministry was the call to serve others selflessly. Jesus, who had all the glory and power, chose a life of humility and service, demonstrating that true greatness lies in becoming the least among men. This passage challenges us to re-evaluate our lives and ask ourselves if we are living to be served or to serve, just as He did.

The idea of servanthood might seem daunting in a world that often glorifies self-promotion and individual achievement. Yet, Jesus offers a paradigm shift by showing us that the path to fulfillment and true joy is in serving others. It’s about stepping out of our comfort zones, lowering ourselves, and tending to the needs of those around us. When we serve with love and humility, we reflect the essence of Christ’s mission and the promise of a life filled with divine purpose.

Servanthood invites us into a new way of living—one where our everyday actions, no matter how small, carry the potential to transform lives, including our own. Serving others doesn’t always require grand gestures; often, it means lending a listening ear, showing kindness, or lending a helping hand. We are called to mirror the love and compassion of Jesus, becoming the vessels through which His love flows.

Actions to Take
---------------

1. Volunteer your time and skills to a local community organization or church that serves those in need.

2. Practice active listening by setting aside distractions and giving your full attention to someone sharing their thoughts with you.

3. Perform random acts of kindness, such as paying for a stranger’s coffee or writing a note of encouragement to a friend.

4. Make it a weekly habit to do one act of service for a family member, friend, or neighbor without expecting anything in return.

5. Reflect daily on ways you can use your talents and resources to be of service to others around you.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. Reflect on a time when someone served you selflessly. How did it impact your life and how can you pay it forward?

2. Write about an area of your life where you feel called to serve. How can you begin taking steps toward that calling?

3. Identify a person in your life who could use your help this week. What specific actions can you take to serve them?

4. Consider how serving others has transformed your understanding of leadership. What qualities of a Christ-like leader come to mind?

5. Reflect on how serving others has brought you closer to understanding God’s purpose in your life.

Prayer
------

Dear Lord,

Thank you for the example of servanthood that Jesus set for us through His life. Help me to embrace the heart of a servant, putting the needs of others before my own desires. Guide me to serve selflessly and love deeply, just as you have loved me. Show me the way to live out my faith through acts of kindness and compassion, bringing Your light to those who need it most. Strengthen me with courage and fill my heart with joy as I walk in obedience to Your call to serve. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.

Q&amp;A about Servanthood
-------------------------

Certainly! Servanthood is an important concept in various cultures and religions, often emphasizing humility, selflessness, and service to others. Here’s a Q&amp;A based on the theme of servanthood:

- - - - - -

**Q: What is the concept of servanthood?**

A: Servanthood is the mindset and practice of prioritizing the needs of others before one’s own. It involves acts of service that are performed with humility and selflessness. Servanthood is often associated with leadership styles that emphasize guiding and supporting rather than commanding and controlling.

**Q: How does servanthood relate to leadership?**

A: Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy where the leader’s primary goal is to serve others. This concept contrasts with traditional leadership, which focuses on the accumulation and exercise of power. A servant leader prioritizes the growth, well-being, and empowerment of team members and the community.

**Q: Can you provide an example of servanthood in practice?**

A: One example of servanthood is volunteering at a local charity or community organization. This could include serving meals at a homeless shelter, tutoring children, or organizing community clean-up events. In each case, the individual offers their time and resources to benefit others, expecting nothing in return.

**Q: Why is servanthood considered a virtue in many cultures and religions?**

A: Many cultures and religious traditions view servanthood as a virtue because it fosters community, compassion, and connection. It emphasizes the importance of caring for others and often aligns with values such as altruism, empathy, and humility. In many religious texts, serving others is seen as a pathway to greater moral and spiritual fulfillment.

**Q: How can one cultivate a mindset of servanthood?**

A: Cultivating a servanthood mindset involves intentional practices such as active listening, empathy, and gratitude. One can start by identifying opportunities to serve others in everyday life, whether at home, work, or in the community. Reflecting on the positive impact of these actions and seeking feedback from those served can further develop this mindset.

**Q: What are the challenges of practicing servanthood?**

A: Practicing servanthood can be challenging due to personal and external factors, such as a lack of time, resources, or support. Additionally, individuals may struggle with ego, fear of being taken advantage of, or difficulty prioritizing others’ needs consistently. Overcoming these challenges requires self-reflection, commitment, and sometimes seeking guidance from mentors or peers.

**Q: What famous figures exemplify servanthood?**

A: Historical and contemporary figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and Nelson Mandela are often cited as exemplifying servanthood. Each of these individuals dedicated their lives to serving others, making significant sacrifices to improve the well-being of those around them. Their legacy continues to inspire others to serve with humility and compassion.

But it occurs to me that not everyone drinks, and you also never know when you might be putting someone in an awkward position who's in recovery.

There's always something like coffee, or other foodstuffs, but it's so hard to know what other people like, dietary restrictions, etc. 

Gift cards are obviously way too weird and impersonal for the task. 

And it's too early in the neighbor relationship to bring back those old power tools I borrowed forever-ago and never returned.

She’s been complaining about feeling tired, having constant headaches, and even struggling to focus during meetings. It was starting to worry me.  

During one break, Anna mentioned skipping breakfast and lunch again because “vitamins cover everything anyway.” I casually said something like, “You know, vitamins can’t really replace actual food, right? They’re meant to supplement your diet, not replace it entirely.” I tried to keep my tone light and conversational, not judgmental, because I genuinely care about her well-being.  

Anna got really defensive and snapped, “I don’t need a lecture, I’m fine.” I immediately apologized and said I wasn’t trying to shame her or tell her how to live her life, just that I was worried because she didn’t seem like herself lately. She rolled her eyes and walked off.  

Later, another coworker pulled me aside and said they were worried about Anna too but didn’t want to say anything because she’s sensitive about her habits. This made me feel a bit better, but I still wonder if I overstepped.  

To add context: Anna and I aren’t super close, but we’re friendly. I honestly wasn’t trying to criticize her—I’ve struggled with unhealthy habits myself in the past, and I know how easy it is to fall into a pattern when life gets busy. I thought I was helping by gently pointing it out, but now I feel like I might have embarrassed her.  

I mentioned the situation to a friend, and they said I was being “judgy” and acting like I know better than Anna about her health. But another friend said I did the right thing because it’s important to speak up when you see someone potentially harming themselves, even if they don’t want to hear it.  

So, AITA? Should I have just stayed quiet and minded my own business, or was it okay to say something out of concern?

Flow through the grouphead is ~3 g/s with or without coffee, or with the shower screen removed. Flow through the steam wand is ~8 g/s.

Things I’ve done:
1. Descale the machine is the normal way (not pulling anything apart). This worked for a few days, then went back to ~3 g/s flow.
2. Remove and descale the solenoid valve by soaking in neat descaler and blowing out with compressed air. This worked for a few days, then the flow got progressively slower, and eventually practically stopped.
3. Remove and descale the boiler, and solenoid valve. There was *a lot* of crap in the boiler, but I cleaned it as thoroughly as I could, soaking in neat descaler and a brass brush. This worked for one day, then I got to the current situation.

My guess is that some loose scale somewhere in the machine is back in the solenoid valve. Is that likely right? If so, and assuming I really got the boiler itself clean, should I pull it down and descale the solenoid again?, or could I solve it by just running descaler through the machine again?",1,1733448910.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

She denied everything, called me offensive and told me never to message her again. I would like third party eyes that aren't biased and that can give me advice on how to move forward.

For context

F and I work together, she's pushed for months to break into my bubble and finally made it in. I was apprehensive and dismissive. She constantly glances at me, pulls her hair in my presence, approaches me for small talk, compliments me, hugs, talks to me like I'm the most interesting person on earth and early on moved away from her friends at meetings so she could sit next to me.

The date (Before the Incident)

The week of the incident F approached me and extended an open invitation to get coffee, I joined her, she was sweating in the elevator. We had a deep conversation. ""Someday your jacket will be mine,"" she declared. ""You'll have to go get your own in X country,"" I replied. ""That's too big of a commitment for me,"" she teased. Our conversation extended onto the metro and when she got off she caressed my arm, which I believe was an invitation to get off with her so things could escalate. I didn't.

The incident (My perception)

We we were working together at an event, she was flirty. She invited me barhopping with her friend K which was weird because she knows I don't drink. She told me I had to eat more, I asked why and she said ""Because people get angry when they're hungry."" We then had a conversation on my anger management.

Later she brought up my choice not to drink, and continued to question my decision not to. I explained I don't like to drink, I don't want to drink and after I told her I don't because I have a medical condition and she suggested I could still drink, I dropped the conversation. She later backed out of barhopping, but we continued for the planned pre-drinking.

I believe she had everything set up with K, but he sabotaged her plans. He invited six more girls without telling her. At the party I distance myself from the group. F drops on all fours to reach for something in a sexually suggestive position and has her backside towards me. In the group conversation she casually mentions her boyfriend and partner. K immediately pulls out cards against humanity and the statement he reads is ""What do you do when the girl of your dreams rejects you?"" I read two cards in my hand ""Pursue other girls, eat shit,"" and walk out of the party. F and I made eye contact and stared at me as I was leaving. I was going through a lot of emotions and felt humiliated.

All this leads me to believe her ultimate goal that night was to get me drunk so I would be more amenable to her open relationship and physical intimacy.

After the Incident

Day 1: I canceled our group hang out, Day 2 I avoided her at the meeting, Day 3 I blocked off the seat next to me, but she took it anyway. She turned towards me ""How was your weekend?"" I responded coldly. She continued to glance at me, I noticed she removed a giant ""Love"" sticker from her laptop. After the meeting she stood behind me waiting for me to get up and leave with her, I ignored her and she wished me a good day.

Next week she approached me during the break of a meeting, asked how I was doing and we had a normal conversation with another colleague. After the meeting F stormed out of the room. We take the same line home and I saw her in the distance. She turned back, saw me and hid behind a bus stop. I ignored her.

I felt bad and wanted to give her a chance to fix things with a new dynamic. I texted we could have a friendly meetup later in the week. ""Thanks for letting me know,"" she replied.

The next day she sat one seat away from me, and continued to glance at me. She was obviously in emotional distress, we made eye contact once and she made sad eyes.

The Confrontation

Eventually I gained clarity. I texted her that we are nothing more than colleagues and going forward she must respect my boundaries. She questioned why I was so angry and said she was nothing but respectful. I explained everything that happened that night and how it made me feel. I told her it was manipulative but explained I believed she was not acting in bad faith and I may have misinterpreted some things. She denied it all declaring she was never interested, said she wouldn't address my claim that she attempted to get me to drink because it was BS, called me offensive and told me never to text her again.",1,1733448604.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only. Don't trade based on these opinions and speculations. I get the dates wrong all the time.

Greetings all. What an exciting day today and exciting time to be alive. I hope you're all having fun. With the latest tweet from RK, things are starting to look like it's lining up. I've had plenty of theories in the past, a few of them missed the mark on timing and way to early (but possibly not wrong?). We are just weeks away from the four year anniversary of the January 28, 2021 Sneeze peak before they turned off the buy button. I went back to take a look at the timeline and a couple of memes and there seems to be some coincidences on date alignment.

The chart created what looks like to be a kitty flicking over a small domino on 9/20/24 when RK dropped Dog Food and possibly be the large buyer on that date? And ever since then, the price has been gradually curving upwards. If you think about it, it looks like a much larger pattern of the sloping curve from March 2024 earnings to end of April 2024 curving upwards. Starting with the earnings date in June 2024 until now is the larger pattern. You've got that ramp that looks like the RK tweet of the Pixar movie Luca when they ran down the ramp. RK tweeted this movie scene but it looks like it has been deleted from his tweet history. But he referenced the movie in one of his +110 tweets (now +122 tweets as of today). This time, our ramp is much, much larger than the March-April ramp. We've spent 6 long months building this ramp and probably have another month to go. Wait a minute... 7 months... 1 month... 7 - 4 - 1 ???!!! Our ramp is  7~ months long compared to the 1~ month ramp. How high are we flying?

""Remember, VESPA means FREEDOM."" - Alberto (Pixar, Luca - June 18, 2021)  
(Same day RK left social media after posting a tweet of a sleeping cat. He stayed dormant for three years before his return.)

Could the big buy creating the large green candle on 9/20/24 the midway point? From the peak to the day before that would equal 88 days and 88 days after will be The Sneeze four year anniversary peak. The Crazy 88 was mentioned in RK's Kill Bill meme. He may have hinted that he was going alone (in the dark) and it would be 88 days before he wins that fight and turn uno reverse the price momentum. Now we're way far into the second 88 days and very close to the end. Coincidentally the Flip Mode Nine Seven meme also seem to line up with the dates where September 7 (a weekend non trading day) is the split between 79 days from the peak to the half and then another 97 days from the half to The Sneeze peak anniversary.

Then you have RC tweeting the 5 shots of coffee in reference to RK's 5 expresso shots to pre game from his live stream right on August 5, 2024. 110 trading days from there is coincidentally January 10, 2025 or 1/10. Now we have RK tweeting a TIME magazine which is referencing 1:09. I don't know what that means but it seems to be a key piece to the puzzle. This is all speculation and I could be completely wrong about this but could the sand worm from the Dune tweet reference arrive on January 10 and we want to be like Paul Atreides and time the jump just right before? Another time reference is from the Aladdin tweet about timing a jump off a building to be one step ahead to avoid disaster.

[https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791506465876033821/video/1](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791506465876033821/video/1)

What if price momentum goes parabolic before that date? Does that mean you get off before ""disaster""? Disaster for who? Or does it mean to jump on the sand worm because it is about to arrive? There's too many ways this scenario can play out and we won't know until a few more weeks into the holiday and New Years. If you holding onto shares, this wouldn't matter.

Another coincidence is that after today's tweet, 35 trading days from today is... you guessed it! The Sneeze peak anniversary. Yeah... yeah... another T+35. Could be another flop, but it's a fun coincidence.

If we count all of RK's meme with a total of +122 now, it would take us into February. Is the momentum just getting started in January or will it fall off again end of January? We'll see...

Is 4:20 just a fun reference or is it hinting April? That would circle us back to a full 1 year since the requel began.

Lastly, I'll leave you with this. April 7, 2025 is a Monday.

We met at our university and began hanging out to get coffee twice a week. At some point we even went to a concert together, I really started to get comfortable around them. 

Fast forward to summer and we stop being able to see each other. She got busier with work, and lost a family member. I tried to be supportive but she became very distant. I kept sending little texts to check up on her every week or two, even if she didn’t respond. I had let her know she didn’t have to if she didn’t feel like it. I really tried to be there in whatever little way I could because I truly did care. When I ran into her in the next semester we had a small chat before she had to go. I messaged her saying it was nice seeing her again. She blocked me a few hours later. 

Now it’s been over 3 months since she blocked me out of nowhere. I know the holidays can be a rough time for anyone grieving so I don’t think I should reach out yet. I don’t want to add any stress, but I really want to reconnect at some point. Her birthday is early next year, I’d like to try messaging her. I want to try and get my friend back.

# Miranda is awful, but Andy is too naive to empathize for

Miranda's treatment of Andy is awful. I would feel bad for Andy if she was not so stupid. She is an aspiring journalist who is way too unperceptive to be an effective one.

From the beginning, she is being told by everyone her position is one people would die for. Despite this, she still sees it as a joke despite being told over and over again how serious this role is. The only reason she wanted the job is because her other choice was Auto Universe magazine. [Andy snickers at the choice of belts to choose.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL-KQij0I8I) Miranda dresses her down in front of everyone. I would feel bad for her if she did not already been made aware how big of a deal this is. Like girl, you've been told so many times.

Next, Miranda asks her to do the impossible task of finding her a flight. When she fails, she is admonished by Miranda.

>I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid. But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl. I had hope. I always have hope. But you’re as disappointing as anyone else.

Narratively, this scene is not earned. The task should be something difficult but not impossible, and probably something that someone who is interested in fashion could manage. Her saying that to Andy is more petty than cruel given the circumstances.

So what does Andy learns from this? [That Miranda hates her.](https://imgur.com/5Q2PaYS) [Nigel gives her a reality check.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJf-J5RXxw8) Nigel once again tells her how important Runway is, something she should have caught on right now. Then, Andy comes up with the first smart idea: start dressing like she works at Runway. Nigel even helps her, probably thinking ""this dumb bitch finally caught on"".

Later, Nigel is telling Andy about Miranda's scale:

>In her way. There’s a scale. One nod, good. More than one nod -- very good. There is only one actual smile on record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she doesn’t like it, she shakes her head. And then there’s the pursing of the lips. Catastrophe.

So what are Andy's first words after this?

>So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?

LIKE HOW ARE YOU STILL NOT GETTING THIS??????

Smart Andy is then gets bamboozled by twins in messing up the book delivery. For punishment, Miranda is giving her impossible task #2: get the unreleased Harry Potter book in 4 hours. She gets it done, which is insane. She is finally happy to get something right (that something right is literally doing the impossible, but to her it's like ""hahaha I finally did not majorly fuck up"")

The movie seems to want to make us believe that Andy is similar to Miranda. Miranda tells Andy:

>I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.

How does Miranda see ANYTHING in her in Andy??? Andy is so naive and dumb. Then Miranda says that what Andy did to Emily was cold. How???

Miranda was basically threatening to fire Andy if she did not go to Paris. Hell,[ Andy even went to visit Emily in the hospital after her accident.](https://imgur.com/Qm3RMWj) Andy should know how Emily would feel about the Paris trip, but she is like ""omg you know how she is"". Either she is like Miranda visiting Emily at the Hospital for some sick pleasure (doubtful), or she is just naive about how the world works.

Anyways, Andy is pretty dumb.

# Nate is not really a bad boyfriend.

A big piece of the conversation revolving this movie is how bad of a boyfriend Nate is. Some even say he is the real villain. This is ridiculous. Here is my scene by scene take on him.

***SCENE 1 - Opening Montage***

[The first shot we get of Nate is him chilling in bed saying ""Good luck."" ](https://imgur.com/HCjFzJt)This is a man with no aspirations. While his girlfriend is getting ready to work, he is reading the comics + games section of the newspaper. Andy and Nate seem to be in good terms her though, so she is familiar with how he is.

***SCENE 2 - Dinner with Friends***

When Andy, Nate, and their friends go out to eat, her friends and her take solace in the fact that they all have shitty jobs. When walking back to home, they hold hands and make fun of how ridiculous the workers dress at Runway. This shows how both Andy and Nate do not take their jobs too seriously.

***SCENE 3 - Andy Coffee Dial***

Andy wakes up to a phone call from Emily and has to go get coffee immediately. [Nate's gives the look like he is saying ""oh brother... jobs am I right??""](https://imgur.com/lFllBP4)

***SCENE 4 - Andy is Venting About Her Job***

Nate is cooking a grilled cheese sandwich on a skillet, which is awfully on-brand for our underachieving king. Nate serves her the grilled cheese which Andy says that she will not partake because everyone is skinny at Runway (red flag?!?). Andy then makes the promise of it being only one year, which Nate nonchalantly says ""Easy there, tiger."" while he is chewing on the grilled cheese. Classic Nate.

***SCENE 5 - New Wardrobe***

Andy surprises Nate with her new clothes. Nate hits her with a [classic Nate line.](https://imgur.com/cALodxM) Now Nate somewhat superficially likes an aspect of her job.

***SCENE 6 - Bar with Friends***

This is where the main issue arrives. Andy sings the praises of Runway, which then Nate makes a quip about Andy drinking the Kool-Aid after praising Runway. This makes sense, they both laughed at how silly fashion is in the beginning, Nate still remains the same while Andy now admires it. The friends playing with her work phone when they just accepted gifts she got from work is shitty though.

Sidenote: the next scene, blonde hair man asks for some samples of her writing to get her connections. She rejects this offer because she is Miranda's assistant. So maybe Nate was onto something here...

***SCENE 7 + 8 - Andy calls Nate Saying She Wants to Quit.***

After given the impossible task of getting the Harry Potter books, she calls Nate saying she wants to quit. [We finally see Nate working, which is cool too.](https://imgur.com/SOoIlim) Next scene Nate comes home to see Andy working on the twins' science project (Red flag?!?!?!).  She starts defending her boss after Nate calls her a wacko (a wacko surely would not have their assistant work on her niece's science project). The conversation comes to an end when [Andy shows her sexy bra](https://imgur.com/SXRlBEL), which is the weakness of a simple man like Nate.

***SCENE 9 - Poor Nate is Alone on his Birthday***

Andy was working and had to miss Nate's birthday. She then [comes home to a single cupcake with a candle on top of it saying ""Happy Birthday"".](https://imgur.com/d8MSnyD) After briefly explaining herself, Nate just says ""Don't worry about it. I'm going to bed"". Not even Andy's sexy bra will save her this time. He then tells her ""You look very pretty"", and goes to bed. He is unhappy because Andy bailed on him.

***SCENE 10 - Andy Won't Go to Bed***

Nate asks Andy if she will go to bed. She says [five minutes ](https://imgur.com/9QnrUni)(doubtful). She is looking at some personal photos, but the tension is definitely there.

***SCENE 11 - The Art Exhibit***

Andy's friend sees the blonde man giving Andy a kiss on the cheek. Andy's friend asks Andy why she is cheating on Nate (it is a misunderstanding). The friend leaves, and clueless ass Nate comes from the back asking [""You're going to Paris?""](https://imgur.com/K90oVIo)

Nate asks ""I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or..."" and Andy responds ""Great. Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?"". Andy walks away [leaving Nate in utter shock.](https://imgur.com/Se2YpsG) They argue. Nate suggests to take a break. When Nate is walking away, Andy calls for him, but alas she gets call from Miranda.

This is probably the most contentious scene, but I do not see how Nate is in the wrong. Andy is completely different now, why would they want to stay together anyways? Nate is asking her to be genuine: either be the same with him or aspire to be a Runway worker. And he got his answer in the end, she decides to answer Miranda.

***SCENE 12 - Andy Apologizes to Nate***

Andy apologizes to Nate, saying:

>Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?

This is apology misses the point. Andy shouldn't be sorry about that, she should be sorry for not knowing what she really wanted to be. Nate accepts the apology though, he is not very bright.

**IN CONCLUSION - Is Nate a Bad Boyfriend?**

Not really. He is a dumb underachiever. Andy changed too much and will not acknowledge it, so Nate had to say it openly for her to understand.

**TL;DR: The movie is not very well written.**",0,1733448399.0,movies,7,0.33,False

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ As stated in my title I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

~ Good communication and someone who likes to go one random coffee or boba runs. Anime lovers and gamers are a plus as well. Would love a gamer friend/girlfriend.",1,1733448290.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1h7pkf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1h7pkf0/need_some_advice_before_i_go_and_ruin_another/,Need some advice before I go and ruin another relationship ,"Hi petty potatoes😊 I have a bit of an issue which I need some advice on. (First time poster, apologies for bad storytelling, also I was outside and it was cold and when I came inside I drank coffee so I'm hyper and it's 2am and I'm overthinking so I'm looking for some advice here)
Here's some context:

I (20F) am currently single, and have been so for over year. I have been best friends with ""Ryan""(23M) for about 4 years now, he's my favorite person and we get each other and share a brithday, never had a falling out ever since we started talking. He and I knew each other from school and were in the same clubs but we've never been involved with each other romantically. 
Ryan was dating ""Mia"" and they'd been together for over a year. Mia had a cousin ""Terry""(22M) who was studying in another city but would come on holidays to visit his family and the three of them had grown up together (Ryan, Mia and Terry) and I was the newest addition to that circle. Ryan introduced me to Terry and we instantly clicked and started dating shortly after. 
Mia and I were not close, nor did we ever have an actual conversation...we have different personalities and showed me an attitude from the word go. It helped that she also studied in another city, we never interacted so much.

In summary, the web is, I'm dating my best friend's best friend and he's dating my boyfriend's cousin😁

11 months into our relationship, Terry and I break up but both of us remain best friends with Ryan. He'd actually started acting up after I got a scholarship to study abroad(long story, if you want it I'll tell it ...it's also kinda juicy). Ryan and Mia had their own relationship issues and by that time they'd broken up and reconciled twice. 

During that time, I met ""George"" (22M) who got the same scholarship opportunity as me and we became good friends,  also not romantically involved, though to be fair he did ask me out and I said no. 

A month before I was to leave the country, Ryan had to go back to school and I was not going to get the opportunity to see him again so we planned to meet up for ice cream and just hang out one last time. This was obviously not the first time I'd hung out with Ryan and we had a habit of taking long strolls together for hours whenever we got the chance, so that's what we did. 
Nothing weird happened on that meeting but someone told Mia that Ryan was cheating on her with me and she broke up with him. I know nothing happened but I still feel bad for being the catalyst of their breakup. But also, she knew that I dated her cousin and that Ryan had a bro code to stick to, so chances of that being true we low.

Fast forward to this year, I moved but still am besties with Ryan, everything is great, we talk online and he's moved on and stuff. George is in the same country as me but we live in different cities, an hour away from each other. We talk occasionally and he's my best friend in this country. When he started dating ""Page"" , a very controlling girl in my opinion, he started being distant. I tried to befriend Page at first but she gave me a ""get away from my man "" attitude.
We'd had a very vibrant relationship and it changed, whenever we met, we couldn't even hug or just talk as we normally would (we'd always been crazy together) and he told me that Page would get mad and shout at him if he talked to other girls.  He became overall distant to all his friends, even guys as Page always wanted to be on a call with him if they were not together in person. So many other things happened like that, but I gave him space as I understand the terms of their relationship... I chose to support him anyway from a distance.

Recently, George has been contacting more often and apologizing for neglecting his friends, and he's been making adjustments with Page to be able to do other things with his friends too. I was talking to him and he suggested going to the movies to on Christmas to catch up but I'm skeptical because I don't want to be the reason they break up after the Ryan incident.

1h7pj37,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7pj37,I guess the cat is Neurotypical. A story of the Cat Who Ate My Vyvanse. ,"Flair: I picked Funny Story because ultimately after a long day she is fine. But PSA VYVANSE CAN KILL cats, get them to the vet IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!

Meet Ivy, the Medication Stealing Menace. 

You see, Ivy was the Failed Rescue. You know the one when you already have 3 cats and swear you won't have any more but this one is abandoned and the animal shelter is closed temporarily so they ask you to foster her and you agree, but 3 months later you fall in love with her and so does your husband and then he says ""Guess we have 4 cats now"" so you take that as permission to keep her? 

She is as feisty as they come. She is ""From Tha Streetzzz"" and has regularly been picking fights with your 15lb male cat since she was 3 lbs and 8 weeks old. She never gets tired, never gives up, and quickly became Queen Kitten Of The House as she dethroned all other house cats to claim her rightful place. The day I found her she was screaming, growling, hissing and clawing at me, but by the time I brought her to the shelter she was purring at them. She refused to be surrendered to the pound so she worked her way into my house and heart. 

On any regular day she can be seen picking fights with cats 3x her size, stealing food anytime she can, chasing or eating any innocent bugs that somehow found their way inside, climbing on furniture she isn't supposed to be climbing on, and stealing things of mine she shouldn't be stealing. And then she comes to take a nap in your lap and you melt like a ChapStick you accidentally left in your pocket that ended up in the dryer.

Today, I woke up and found she had gotten into some tin foil and chewed that up. Shaking my head and rolling my eyes, I cleaned it up. I fed all the cats their food, and went about my day making my own breakfast. Ivy decided to chase the other cats around, and I ate my breakfast. Stupidly, I took my Vyvanse out and set it down next to my cup of water. I went to the kitchen to get my breakfast, got distracted, eventually came back to eat my breakfast and noticed my pill was missing. ""Huh that's weird. Guess I took it already"". At this point, the cat was nowhere to be seen and I had no indication she had climbed on the table to get it. It was about 9:15am. I ate my breakfast without any second thoughts. I went and laid on the couch for a bit, and Ivy came and took a nap on me.

Around 10:15 I thought to myself ""Wow, not drinking coffee with my Vyvanse today really did cut back on the anxiety. I feel pretty good. I'm gonna have some coffee now slowly. "" So I went and made some coffee. I felt productive so I put my dishes in the dishwasher. I went to sit back on the couch and drink some coffee while scrolling my phone. It is now 10:30, and somehow, Ivy was on the carpet, getting into trouble again. I have a white and gray throw carpet. My 20mg Vyvanse is a white pill. I have no contacts in, and the cat is mildly nibbling and spitting something out onto the carpet. I thought it was the lady bug she had been chasing, and decided to get up and get it away from her in case she ate it and it made her sick.

You guys. It was not a lady bug.

 It was a white wad of..... ""Paper. Wait. Why is it gooey?"" At this point, I look at the piece of wet ""paper"" and it's gooey and realized it was my Vyvanse capsule. Broken open, slightly melted, and had tooth marks in it. There was powder around the pill, so she definitely ingested some. 

A quick Google search says it's extremely toxic and potentially lethal to cats in very small doses even as small as 1mg per 2.2 lbs body weight. Well, Ivy is 5.5 lbs and my pills are 20mg. 

Quickly I call the vet, which recommended I bring her in ASAP but also who makes me call Animal Poison Control (Which costs $95), and I'm calmly grabbing the rest of the pill, the prescription bottle for reference, and the cat.

 I got her to the emergency vet in under an hr from ingestion, walking up to the front desk and explaining ""Hi, yes, I'm the girl who's menace of a kitten ate her ADHD medication. "" 

They took her right away, and followed up with the Poison Control. After about an hour they ask me to come give them more information.... And the first thing out of the vets mouth is ""Is she always so.... Worked up... Or is that the side effects of the meds?"" Instantly I'm turning red and laughing, telling them she can be a bit feisty and thankfully had a few videos of her obnoxious behavior the day I got her home. She screams instead of meows, and she growls a lot. But she is a good baby, I swear! 

 A treatment plan was decided and they kept her for monitoring for 8hrs. She didn't show any signs of distress, cardiac arrest, or seizures. They had to give her a sedative just to be able to give her an exam, but other than that she was given the clear to come home.

We have been home for two hours now and she is happier to be home. I have to monitor her for signs of head bobbing, gazing into space without direction, pacing, agitated behavior, seizures, and the usual. This could have ended a lot worse had I not gotten the pill away from her, or not known she even took it. I was able to stay calm, act fast, and get her treated. There has been posts on this in the past, but let this be a lesson that cats DO LIKE AMPHETAMINES. They are attracted to the smell apparently. I made a terrible human error today, and it could have cost me my beloved Ivy, and thankfully it did not. Please, keep your meds in the bottle until you put them directly in your mouth. My medication how now been moved out of the kitchen and into my bedroom, upstairs, behind two cat proof doors. The cats can't even get to the second floor of my house, and they can't open doors. Should be safe that way.

Side note, my kitten is now kinda wandering the house, with dilated eyeballs and drinking lots of water and eating her food, and staring around while acting like she's seeing things that don't exist. She also has plenty of energy like she doesn't want to rest, doesn't want to take a nap, and doesn't want to sit still.

 I guess the cat is Neurotypical, y'all.",23,1733448053.0,adhdwomen,7,0.85,False

So I have a friend Malcolm who I met a few years ago through a mutual hobby. Malcolm is a nice dude - he’s very thoughtful and has taught me new ways to appreciate life and I’m very grateful for this. Here’s the problem: Malcolm did not have many friends growing up, and so he can get kind of clingy to the few that he has now. I moved away a year ago to a new city and leading up to it, Malcolm got kind of pushy about hanging out and checking off items on our to-do list. I told him I did not have the bandwidth for it, and he still kind of pushed for it. I could tell he genuinely just wanted us to have a fun time and there was nothing malicious. In addition to this, I realized his personality started to annoy me in small ways.

First, everything with him is a “thing.” Anything he likes immediately defines his entire personality, and he constantly talks about it. If he does anything that conflicts with his personality, it’s suddenly a huge crisis (think “I like bench pressing, but today I enjoyed squatting at the gym. what does this mean???”). Also, he would interrupt me when I was having quiet introvert time with my headphones on (I told him to please stop but he kept going). He also sends me tons of TikToks a day, and I don’t have time to see all of them (nor do they relate to my sense of humor). I can see him trying to act like our mutual friends sometimes (trying to get people to like him by imitating people who are liked) but it annoys me and my friends. We have told him this too, that he can just be himself and it would be enough. He has referred to me as his best friend on several occasions but I don’t want this title :(

Now that I’ve moved, Malcolm has much fewer friends in his new town (he also moved). He often talks about visiting or asks people to visit him. I feel really bad but I don’t want to host him if he comes over and I would much rather just see him for coffee or a dinner because my Malcolm bandwidth is much lower now. I feel like a bad person because he is always excited to talk to me and see me; meanwhile, I’m exhausted and annoyed by any conversation I have with him. I crashed on his couch a few months back when I visited and it was just Too Much Malcolm to handle. I want him to make more friends.

tl;dr: friend got clingy and annoying, I feel like a bad person for thinking this. not sure how to phase out our friendship.",2,1733447971.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

At first, I thought it sounded interesting—maybe something along the lines of Irish coffee (though I’ve never actually had one). Naturally, I was curious and gave it a try.

Well, let me tell you... I hated it.

I had this idea in my head that it would have the rich aroma of coffee mixed with a subtle oakiness, like you’d get from a good bourbon barrel-aged product. Instead, all I can smell is that strong, typical bourbon scent—completely overpowering the coffee.

Now, I don’t hate the smell of bourbon itself. I think it’s great—*when it’s in a glass*. But when that same smell comes wafting out of a cup of coffee, combined with lukewarm steam and zero trace of the usual comforting coffee aroma? It’s honestly depressing.

My morning Americano used to be one of the highlights of my day. Now, I find myself counting down the cups, just trying to finish this bag so I can get back to my regular, unflavored beans.

Am I the only one who feels this way? The fact that my roaster decided to produce this blend means there must be a demand for it, right? Do you think I’ll eventually grow to like it? Would love to hear your thoughts!",3,1733447603.0,espresso,15,0.71,False

He retorted that he knew exactly at which levels to buy into Bitcoin instead. He said he knew exactly how to read the chart to determine where the support levels are and when to cash out. He empathized that the cashing-out part was paramount for 'poor' dudes like us, which struck me as I saw Bitcoin as my main buy and hold asset, it was my strategy. I guess I was influenced a lot from Larry Jones and his 5-dollar cup of Coffee DCA philosophy.  

  
So I told him DCA is just as valid a strategy to take if you were to do Bitcoin trading. He wasn't having it, adding that only the rich can afford to do that as they can mindlessly just dump in money into BTC and it would work out for them anyways. He said for us we needed to really time the market. I replied then how can we properly predict where the market is going to go? He said there's clear signals on the chart, where you see the rallies and support levels, and then the resistance levels. These are where you can tell whether to buy or not, he told me like a precise science and that it was the truth. And I do see that it was truth, once I took in what he was saying. But I had doubts as to if this is THE consistent way that he was describing. 

  
It was the way he said it that surprised me, he was so convinced that this was the ONE correct way that nothing I said about how DCA works was entertained, much less considered as a valid strategy.  

  
He didn't strike me as someone who was particularly successful in trading or is super-rich off this strategy so I just let it slide because he was a relative.

1h7p8mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1h7p8mw/looking_for_this_novel/,Looking for this novel,"My husband is a famous author and always dedicates books to me, but when I opened his latest book, he dedicated it to his assistant Rhonda.
""You dedicated your book to her?"" I asked shrilly. ""Are you kidding me, Jet?""
""Park, she was instrumental in getting the book done.""
""You've dedicated every single book you've written to me. To me! Your wife!""
""Parker, it's one book...I couldn't have done it without her. 
""And the celebratory drinks with her? Is that the right thing to do, too? Spending every minute with her for the last four months and ignoring me? Is that the right thing to do?""
I heard her voice in the background. ""Is she complaining again about the time you're spending with me?""
""Jet, I suggest you get home now because I just reached my limit and we have a lot of talking to do.""
""Parker, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I'll be home in an hour and we can talk.""
""You're not hearing me, Jet. Either come home now or you can dedicate all your books to her in the future.""
————————
I pulled up in the driveway and saw a familiar box on the porch, one I'd seen for all of my husband's eleven previous releases. It was his advance copies of his latest book. He must not have gotten the alert that the box was delivered or he must be out, but I breathed a huge sigh of relief.
Of all the books he'd written, this was the only one I'd been uncomfortable with and that was all due to his research assistant he'd hired to help with this one. Rhonda was a PhD candidate and when my husband had reached out to the university for help in this particular subject, they'd recommended Rhonda.
Rhonda helped Jet with his research and seemed to become his constant companion for the last four months as he finalized his chapters and filled in the gaps he'd left that needed to be fleshed out. I hadn't liked how much time he'd spent with her and we'd had several fights about it, but in the end, with deadlines looming, he'd needed her help and expertise. My husband would never miss a deadline.
My relief at seeing this box was immense. This meant Rhonda would be gone from our lives, and we'd get back to normal.
After parking in the garage, I ran to the porch and dragged the box inside. I grabbed a pair of scissors and called my husband.
""Hey, where are you?"" I asked.
""Rhonda and I grabbed a beer to celebrate being done with the book.""
""Haven't you been done for a while?"" I asked, ""Since I'm opening the advance copies?""
""That's what we're celebrating.""
""Used to be I was the one you celebrated with.""
""Don't be like that, Parker.""
""Like what? A wife who's been very understanding about the time you're spending with another woman—and you still are even though you're done with the book you needed her help on?""
""Here's some more shots,"" I heard Rhonda say in the background.
I pulled one of the books out of the box. ""Shots? How long have you been drinking with her?""
""Parker...""
If he said something, I missed it as alarms began going off in my head as I read the dedication:
To Rhonda, whose help on this book was invaluable. I appreciate your help and friendship. This book wouldn't have been possible without your help.
""You dedicated your book to her?"" I asked shrilly. ""Are you kidding me, Jet?""
""Park, she was instrumental in getting the book done.""
""You've dedicated every single book you've written to me. To me! Your wife!""
""Parker, it's one book...I couldn't have done it without her. I felt like recognizing her efforts was the right thing to do.""
""And the celebratory drinks with her? Is that the right thing to do, too? Spending every minute with her for the last four months and ignoring me? Is that the right thing to do?""
I heard her voice in the background. ""Is she complaining again about the time you're spending with me?""
""Jet, I suggest you get in an Uber by yourself and get home because I just reached my limit and we have a lot of talking to do.""
""Parker, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I'll be home in an hour and we can talk.""
""You're not hearing me, Jet. Either come home now or you can dedicate all your books to her in the future.""
""You know I don't like ultimatums.""
""Let me guess, she's melting down about some innocent drinks."" Rhonda needed to shut up.
""Stay out of this, Rhonda,"" Jet growled at her.
""You know what? Change of plans,"" I said to my husband. ""Stay out as late as you want with your book dedication buddy. In fact, go home with her. No need for ultimatums because it took me a while, but I finally got it.""
""What are you talking about?""
""Want to make this a body shot?"" Rhonda was asking.
""Rhonda, would you just shut up?"" he snapped. 
""There's more going on with her, and the dedication proves it. You've been choosing her for four months but I refused to admit it. And you can have her.""
""What are you talking about? I'm coming home right now.""
Was that panic in his voice now that I'd reached my limit and had all I was going to take?
""I won't be here, so no rush.""
Then I hung up.

The first book dedication from Jet to Parker:
This book is dedicated to my beautiful Parker.
Three months ago, I didn't know you. Today, I know you're my everything.
Thinking of Jet's very first dedication to me, I knew I needed some space from him, especially after that phone conversation, so I hurried upstairs and dragged a roller suitcase out of the back of our closet, opening it up flat on the bed. That was where I stalled out for a bit. What did I want to take with me?
What do you take with you when leaving someone you've loved so well and for so long -- even if your leaving is not forever? Do you take any pictures of your life together? Certain mementos that reminded you of important events, happier times? Gifts he'd given you for special occasions?
It was like a multiple choice question, with All of the above and None of the above as the last two options. As an instructional designer, those were terrible options indicative of a weak question. As a wife whose husband was about to very publicly honor another woman over her, I chose None of the above. I didn't want any more baggage than I was already dealing with.
With that decided, I crammed in enough clothes and shoes for a week into the suitcase. I wouldn't be gone forever; at some point I'd have to talk to Jet and determine if there was a way forward, but with our tempers, we could benefit from a cool-down period before we tried to discuss us. If there was still an us, and that seemed unlikely given my current mindset. Who knew what I'd feel when I gave myself some time to think?
Jet and I weren't one of those couples who could talk rationally right away when we were in the thick of a fight. We had to take a step back and settle down, and then we could talk without emotions ruling us, without taking pot shots. Both of us were extremely verbal and we recognized early on in our relationship that it was a double-edged sword. We could talk about anything but we could also fight precisely and pointedly. That was when we set our rules of engagement: step back, calm down, then discuss, even if it meant going to bed angry. It was better than going to bed angrier.
I'd recognized my temper rising at an alarming rate as I was on the phone with Jet, listening to Rhonda in the background, listening to Jet dismiss my concerns...until he realized I was deadly serious. Maybe my leaving would push him even further into her arms, or maybe it'd make him look back over the last four months and think, gee, maybe she had a point. If that realization never hit him, then I'd already completely lost him when he and Rhonda started working together all those months ago. The next move was Jet's; it would be up to him to contact me in a few days. Or not. Right now, I had no idea which way it would go, and that not knowing scared me.
I grabbed a small, waterproof bag and tossed in my toiletries, makeup and hair products, and added that into my suitcase before I zipped it closed.I took the bag down the stairs and removed one of Jet's advance copies from the box. I found a fine-point red sharpie from the junk drawer in the kitchen and wrote a note for him under the dedication to Rhonda.
Jet ~
I think this book is going to be a bestseller. Just the dedication alone took me through all the emotions: I laughed (Is this a joke?), I cried (How could he do this to me? to us?), I swore (PRICK!), I got angry (I'm married to at best a liar, at worst a cheater) and I finally reached acceptance (Maybe we've run our course).
I'm taking a few days away with my phone off. Obviously, it's more than the dedication but I'm sure you'll hyperfixate on that and think this is what you have to fix. It's part of it but not even close to all of it. Every day since you started working with her was leading up to this moment. Every day you chose to spend time with her instead of me when you weren't working on your book was pointing to this path you shouldn't have gone down.
The dedication was simply the result of the bigger problem between us: Rhonda herself. It used to be I would have been the one having the beer with you at the club; now, it's her. This is a lot of hurt and disappointment to process so I'm going to give myself some time to think. Maybe you should think about what you want, too, because you aren't acting like it's me anymore.
~Me
Going back to the junk drawer, I located a thick black Sharpie and wrote KINDLING on the box of the remaining books. I set both on the coffee table so he couldn't miss them when he came home after finally dragging himself away from Rhonda. He'll be home in an hour, my hip.
Pulling up the suitcase's handle, I was about to head out the front door when I heard the thunder of multiple Harleys coming down our street. Even if Jet wasn't in any condition to ride, it sounded like he'd called out the cavalry to stop me from leaving. No. You don't get to decide that we're talking now after months of ignoring me in favor of her, Jet.
