1l8wsow,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l8wsow/does_changing_your_workspace_actually_help_when/,Does changing your workspace actually help when you can't focus? Or am I just wasting money?,"I've been stuck in this weird slump lately. When I'm outside my apartment, I can focus just fine. But the moment I get back to my room, my brain completely ""disconnects."" I'll sit at my desk planning to get things done, and end up just staring at my phone for hours.

At first, I thought I was just being lazy, but my sister pointed out that maybe the real problem is my room environment. This room hasn't changed in three years — still using that too-small desk from college, that terrible chair, everything remains exactly the same.

I'm considering:

* Getting a standing desk (my back is killing me from hunching over)
* Replacing my couch with one that isn't covered in coffee stains
* Installing decent lighting instead of this depressing lamp I have now

But I don't want to throw money at this if it's not actually going to help, you know? Has anyone here actually found that changing your physical space made a difference in how you work? Or is this just me trying to buy my way out of a motivation problem?

If you did change your space and it helped, what made the biggest difference? Was it the desk, the chair, the lighting, or something else I haven't thought of?

I've been dealing with agoraphobia for over a decade now, but in the past year ive been making a serious effort to get the fuck outside, even if it's only to the tiny shopping centre on my street.
I go at least once a week now, and get myself an iced coffee as a reward 🤡

last week, I stepped in, my usual clammy shaky wonderful self, and there's a few people lining up at the counter to order.
The barista sees me, points to me over the people waiting, shouts ""hello sweetness! Your usual?""
Happened again today.

I'm weirdly emotional about it?

I'm terrified of repeat interactions with people.
But I've become a regular. At the supermarket, the coffee shop, the post office.

I guess going from ""can't go outside also gotta be invisible if I do"" to ""regular"" is a big step that I never anticipated being part of my journey lmao

He loved me gently, patiently, completely.

Two weeks ago, he found an old conversation between me and an ex. I never cheated physically, but emotionally? It was a betrayal. It started as friendly catching up. Then I started saying things I wouldn’t have said if Andrew were in the room. Compliments. Jokes that tiptoed over boundaries. Nothing scandalous, but enough.

He didn’t yell. He didn’t call me names. He just sat on the edge of our bed and said, “You lied by omission. And now I don’t know what’s real.”

He moved out three days later.

I’ve been sitting in this quiet apartment, drinking coffee from the mug he left behind, wondering how I became the villain in the one story I didn’t want to fuck up.

1l8wmhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1l8wmhe/betterme_worst_food_to_break_a_fast/,BetterMe: Worst Food to Break a Fast,"Intermittent fasting can be a game-changer for weight loss, energy, and metabolic health—but only if you *break your fast right*. What you eat when your fast ends can either fuel your success or sabotage your progress.

Here’s a quick rundown of what *not* to eat after fasting, and what to reach for instead.

# 🚫 Worst Foods to Break a Fast

When your digestive system is just waking up, hitting it with the wrong foods can cause bloating, fatigue, or worse. Here’s what to avoid:

1. **Ultra-Processed Foods** Think chips, cookies, ready meals. Loaded with sugar, fats, and additives, they spike your blood sugar and offer little nutrition.
2. **Sugary Foods & Beverages** Soda, cereal, candy—these can overwhelm your gut and send your energy crashing fast.
3. **Coffee on an Empty Stomach** Can trigger jitters, anxiety, and even digestive upset. If you love your coffee, have it *after* a nutritious meal.
4. **Processed Red Meats** Bacon, deli meats, and sausages are high in sodium and fat—tough on the stomach after fasting.
5. **High-Fiber Raw Veggies** While healthy, raw legumes or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli may be *too* rough on an empty gut.
6. **Alcohol** Drinking post-fast can dehydrate you quickly, impair digestion, and lead to overeating.

# ✅ Best Foods to Break a Fast

Your goal is to ease your body back into eating with nutrient-dense, easy-to-digest foods. Start light and build from there.

**Top Picks:**

* **Bone Broth or Veggie Soup** – Gentle, hydrating, and packed with electrolytes.
* **Smoothies** – A blend of leafy greens, fruit, and protein (like Greek yogurt or protein powder).
* **Low-Glycemic Carbs** – Oats, sweet potatoes, and non-starchy veggies for slow energy release.
* **Lean Protein** – Chicken, fish, tofu, or eggs to keep you satiated.
* **Healthy Fats** – Nuts, nut butters, and olive oil for long-lasting energy.

❔❔ How do you mentally avoid the urge to binge when your fasting window ends?

I'm working in a middle sized office, 20-30 people. Most are part time, so they leave at 1 pm without a break. Because we have service times, we split our lunchbraks, we can go 12 am or 1 pm. 

For me 12 is way to early, so I always go at 1, sometimes I'm the only person doing lunch at this time, and thats totally fine, I actually like it. I put in my wired headphones and put my phone on my side on the table, so it's very visible that there leads a wire from my phone to my head. I'm positioning myself to look out the window because the breakroom is ugly and I can see the woods and a small mountain though the window. And my back faces the door.

The coffee machine and the place for the dirty dishes is also in this room.

So, 1 pm, I'm eating and listening to something and EVERY FUCKING PERSON coming in this room wants to talk to me. Some are just wishing a nice break or saying goodbye, but as this isn't annoying enough to hear 10 times, some think it's an invitation I'm eating there alone and want to chat. Like wtf? I have headphones in both ears and food in my mouth, just a few minutes of peace, without work. Why do they think it's the right time to talk to me??? I wouldn't care if someone comes in, dispote their dishes or take a coffee. There is literally no need or reason to talk to me! We can all just mind our own business.

‍

**Why This Pick?**  


This might not be a popular opinion, but I think the Over cashes here. Diamondbacks starter Eduardo Rodriguez (6.70 ERA) has allowed 23 ERs over his last 5 outings, but to be frank, I think Arizona will put a few runs away against Bryan Woo (3.07 ERA) as well. Last season, Woo was the definition of an Ace – but in just his last 2 outings, he’s allowed 4 Home Runs and 7 ERs. It’s easy to assume an encounter will be low scoring with Woo’s name on the schedule, but I say the Over hits.

**Transcription Subject: Maarten de Groot, Human Refugee/Meat producer**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: March 25, 2137*

*500, 1000, 1500, 2000.* I counted as I looked over the stacks of 50 credit bills we made today. *2500, 3000, 3200.* Suddenly I was thrown out of my concentration by Gilt slamming a heavy plastic grocery bag onto the coffee table, causing a few credit bills to fall out. “Gilt, what the fuck?”

“Oh, don’t mind me, when you’re done, just throw my cut onto the pile.”

A little confused at his sudden aggression, I decided to subtly ask him what’s wrong. “Okay, sure mate, do you not like earning money, or what?”

“Of course I do! Clean money, not something that can get you arrested for having it.”

I let out a heavy sigh. “Well, what do you want me to do about it? If I launder more with the restaurant, it will become really suspicious… Wait, have you been storing everything in one bag under your bed?”

“No! This is half of my money, the rest is evenly spread hidden throughout the house, and I keep this under the lowest drawer of a cabinet.” Classic trick, there is often a lot of empty space there assuming the cabinet doesn’t have legs and reaches all the way down to the floor. A little too classic though, any cop worth their badge would look there –so still a relatively good spot to hide it from the average exterminator. “This half is just from last week. Next week, this thing will be full, and in another 2 weeks, we have 2 stuffed bags of money. I shouldn’t even count money based on how many bags I have, but on how many… how much money I have in the bank. This is dangerous! And it’s your job to fix this.”

*Fuck, he’s actually right about that one. I am the one in charge of dealing with money.* “Okay, we need a new plan. We have nearly over 30k black credits each, and counting our banks and that of the restaurant together, we have roughly 8,000 white credits to work with. But we make a little more then 4,000 per day. So what processes a ton of cash everyday, so that no one would bat an eye if suddenly a few more thousand credits suddenly go through without anyone noticing?” I said, thinking out loud to myself and hoping Gilt would maybe come up with something.

“We don’t need to launder it per se, we could use a criminal bank. Someone who is willing to store money for us in trade for a payment. There is a risk though: I don’t know anyone who does this personally, and I really shouldn’t. The point of one is that no one will look there for our money; the problem with that, is that we don’t know if we can trust them.” He scratched under his chin, thinking what to do.

“I bet they’re not cheap either, but I guess that Jenek guy would know someone, he sells info after all,” I said as I began cleaning up Gilt’s mess. “How would your old boss deal with it if he had more money than he could launder?”

“You’re not going to like that method either. I don’t know the specifics; I didn’t deal with business, but he knew a guy who could turn it all into white money just like that.” Gilt leaned back into the couch and pulled a lukewarm bottle from between the cushions and took a big swig out of it. “He didn’t like doing it like that, though. The trouble was that it cost a fortune. He would often lose half of his profits on the laundering.”

“Can’t we just get another laundering business up ourselves? Like the restaurant.”

“And what, spend a lot of work on something that will cover a 1/8^(th) maybe a quarter of our profits? It won’t make more than a dent in our problem.”

“Yes, but we have a second problem: the restaurant doesn’t make enough money to support us both if we suddenly stopped pumping in black money. So, if we ever have to keep our heads down for a while, or maybe even permanently, we would have to start looking for a job. And you know how well that went.”

An ear on Gilt’s head raised in confusion. “I thought you said the place makes 500 credits legitimately each day.”

“No, that’s how much money people spend there. That’s all without costs, not counting produce we have to buy, napkins, every glass that gets dropped, we have to pay for Tak —our employee,” I quickly added in case Gilt forgot his name. “Not to mention the lease every month.”

“So you’re saying there’s only enough for one of us?” His eyes narrowed focusing on me.

“Don’t joke about that,” I said, giving him a friendly shove. “Look, we need a place to profit of. We both know that this gig won’t stay up forever. Either we piss the wrong person off, we’re getting arrested, or someone offs us.”

Gilt’s ears folded down with anger and glared at me. “Are you thinking of quitting!? You can’t I ne- We had a deal!”

“Oh shut up, I’m not thinking about leaving by a long shot. We’re finally making bank! The problem is that we have hardly a back-up. When things go tits up —not if, when— we will have hardly anything to fall back on. Hard cash in bags won’t do; it will run dry eventually, and then we’re in the same shit as before.” I sighed and leaned back. Gilt shoved his bottle in my hand, and I thankfully took a swig only to instantly regret getting a mouthful of something that tasted like wound disinfectant.

“All of this still won’t solve the immediate problem, we still need to get rid of this.” He flicked his tail towards the money on the table.

“How about this? I find a business we can set up quickly or take over, because...I don’t know, the owner recently died or some shit. Then we probably need to invest in some new stuff; we do that with black money, and after everything is fully set up, we can see how much this all is an issue.”

“I seriously doubt we need nearly 60 thousand credits for it.” He takes another swig as he seemed to contemplate something. “We’re going to find a criminal bank, while you find us a new legitimate way to make money.”

**\[Time skip 15 minutes\]**

This time, we didn’t make a phone call, before heading off to Jenek’s house, hoping he would be home. It’s a bit rude to show up unannounced, but we didn’t want to alert him for our own safety, we still weren’t sure if we could trust him to not call the exterminators or cops on us. On the very least, he was an info broker and had helped us find us a smuggler (Liiry) back when we still were forced to work for Humanity First. The problem with him was that we didn’t really know the guy all too well, and he might have been selling information to the exterminators as well.

After a bumpy ride with Gilt behind the wheel, who definitely had lost some driving skills from not being behind the wheel for a decade, we arrived at his apartment complex. It was as pristine as last time; Gilt’s van stuck out like a sore thumb in the small car park.

With the lack of security we managed to make our way to his front-door and rang the door whistle, I decided not to hug the wall again like last time, knowing now that he was semi-okay with letting me in and didn’t feel the need to hide myself from him until Gilt had greeted him.

“Gilt, good to see you! Human…” He trailed off trying to think of my name, but his expression was nonetheless a lot less cheery towards me, not that he seemed genuine when he addressed Gilt.

“I’m Maarten.”

“Right...come in, come in,” he said gesturing with his tail. “Before someone calls the exterminators,” he added quickly. “Take a seat, I’ll put the kettle on.”

I looked around as I made my way to the living room while I took my mask off. Several, what I assumed were holiday photos, hung on the wall, none of them displayed him and instead were of buildings and landscapes that were unlike that of Dayside City. Together with the rest of his meagre decorations it all felt sanitized and impersonal, like he was trying to come over a certain way. What way I was not sure, but it just felt painfully normal to the point that it became strange.

A moment later he walked into the living room with 3 cups of tea on a tray and placed it on the coffee table and leaned back into his recliner. “So what do I have to thank for your visit?” he said, only addressing Gilt.

“We need to find a criminal bank and you sell information. How much does this cost?” I nearly facepalmed at his extreme bluntness of the question. Even Jenek recoiled from the directness of it.

“Uhm, sorry, but I don’t know what you’re talking about, I do no such thing.” I let out a sigh and began counting out money, knowing well how letting Gilt make the deal goes. *50, 100.* I counted out in my head as I placed the bills on the table.

“You sell us information, and we pay you, why do you make this so difficult? This doesn’t have to be a...a game where we try to pry the information out while throwing money at you. Name a price!” *150, 200.*

“It’s dangerous to talk about these things out loud.” I said, as I noticed him looking towards the bills on the table, but quickly darting towards Gilt again. *250, 300, 350.*

“If you want to be cryptic, give us a ‘random’ number then.” *400, 450, how expensive is this guy…*

“Gilt, I think he’s just scared that we are caring a wire or are somehow coppers. He can’t be arrested if he doesn’t say anything incriminating. It would be nice if he gave us a price, though.” I turned to him, which caused him to sink into his chair and swallow in fear, he began to eye the money again and gestured with his tail for me to go further up. *500, 550, 600, 650, 700.* “Really? 700? We just need a name and an address.”

“Fine.” He leaned forward keeping an eye on me like I was about to jump him, and grabbed the stack of money, after counting it out quickly he finally answered. “I know a woman in the industry district who for 10 grand stores anything that fits on a pallet. She stores it somewhere in space, an abandoned space station, satellite or on a moon, I don’t know, but I know it’s safe. It does cost another 10 grand to get it back, though.”

I inhaled sharply, realizing that’s a 33% cut for storing the money alone. “That is steep…”

“Does that woman happen to be a Nevok named Liiry?” Gilt said with suspicion in his ears.

He took a nervous sip from his tea before answering. “W-well, you know her?”

“Yes, we know her! Last time we were here, you referred us to her too!”

“Well-well, I can’t remember everything I say. And you didn’t know she also did banking. I helped with that. So I helped with something.”

I dragged a hand over my face in frustration. “We need a new info broker,” I mumbled.

“Give us another person, we’re not letting that woman near our money,” Gilt said angrily.

“Yeah, I’m not going further into bed with that woman. She’s a complete psycho, she has a dead guy in her fridge she wants to keep as decoration. You’re not getting paid unless we get a proper address.”

I suddenly noticed Gilt was giving me a strange look. “You actually went to bed with her?” I looked back at Jenek, and from his shocked expression he seemed to think the same.

“No! Fuck no. It’s a saying, going to bed with someone means doing business with someone.”

I noticed a devious glint in Gilt’s eyes. “So, you only did business with that exterminator? That’s a relief.”

I couldn’t help but smile, happy that he was at least comfortable enough to joke about my feelings towards Cuko. I turned back to Jenek and noticed that he was deep in thought for a moment, before snapping back when he saw me looking at him. “So, do you actually have another bank, or do we need to get that money back from you and give it to another info broker?” He silently waved his tail again to show that he wanted more. “You better have a good bank for us,” I said as I threw another 200 credits on the table.

When the Jenek began waving his tail again, Gilt suddenly launched forward from the couch, slamming his hands on the table. “Liiry pays you to direct people to her!”

The subtle fear he had been trying to hide from me suddenly became clearly visible, and I was by far no longer the source, as he pulled his legs and tail away from Gilt onto his recliner. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Listen, there is another banker, his name is Poroze, he has a place in the southeastern district in an exclusive pub called the Scorched Antler, the password is ‘What the eye not sees and the ear not hears.’ You have to go deeper into the more –let’s say– exclusive part of the pub, but I don’t know how, I swear, that’s all I know.”

Satisfied with the information, Gilt backed off and got up. Still slightly agitated, he made a silent gesture with his tail for me to follow.

I got this off Amazon, Oasser Trunk Organizer and I love it.   In the front pockets I have just some small stuff, my back up fire kit with a striker rod and a waxed rope in the tin, some opinel knives for food prep, a stuff sac and bandana. 

In the main section I have my coffee grounds, lantern, speaker (I do walk tests to make sure neighbors can't hear), knife for wood processing, and my other electronics (battery pack, headlamps, string lights) will go on top.   

In the top small section below my fire gloves (cook with a Dutch oven and cast iron skillet) I have a collapsible kettle, mosquito coils, trash bags, poop kit, all that stuff 

In the small bottom section I have my fuel, sit pads, stove, and in the grey bag is my French press, coffee cups, filters, etc ..   

On top of all that before I close up I put a collapsible basin/cutting board.

Outside my sleep set up, furniture, cooler, and clothes that's what we bring.   It makes it easy because I'll leave everything in there and when we get home wash the dishes in there, charge everything up.  So next trip it's just too off batteries and we're ready.

The enemy wolf’s claws ....","    The scent of blood filled my nostrils as I watched my father fall to his knees. His eyes, once vibrant with life, locked with mine one last time. Run, Elara. Take care of your mother,” he whispered, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. The enemy wolf’s claws tore into my father’s throat before I could even scream. My mother’s arms wrapped around me, dragging me away as I reached out for him, my tiny five-year-old hands grasping at air. “Daddy! No, Daddy!” I jolted upright in bed, my heart hammering against my chest. Sweat soaked through my pajamas, and tears streamed down my face. The same nightmare, always the same. Even thirteen years later, I couldn’t escape that day – the day we fled our pack, the day I watched my father die so we could live. “Just a dream,” I whispered to myself, though the metallic smell of blood still lingered in my memory. My alarm clock showed 6:30 AM. University classes started at 8:30, but I always woke early. Routine kept me sane, kept me grounded. I forced myself out of bed and padded to the bathroom. The girl in the mirror stared back at me – plain, forgettable, exactly as I wanted. I splashed cold water on my face, washing away the remnants of my nightmare. Back in my bedroom, I pulled out my carefully selected outfit: loose jeans, an oversized sweater, and flat shoes. Nothing that would draw attention. Nothing that would make anyone look twice at the omega girl who didn’t belong. I grabbed my large, thick-rimmed glasses from the nightstand. My eyesight was perfect, but these glasses had become my armor. Behind them, I could hide my emotions, create a barrier between myself and the world that had taken my father and left me vulnerable. “Elara? Are you awake, sweetie?” My mother’s voice called from downstairs. “Coming, Mom,” I replied, securing my long brown hair into a low ponytail. In the kitchen, my mother bustled around preparing breakfast. Despite working long hours as the pack’s doctor, she always made time for our morning routine. Her eyes crinkled with concern when she saw me. “The nightmare again?” she asked softly.
    I nodded, sliding onto a stool at our kitchen counter.
    “Here, eat something.” She placed a plate of eggs and toast in front of me. “You’re turning eighteen next month. It’s important to keep your strength up, especially now.”
    I knew what she meant. Turning eighteen meant possibly finding my mate – something most wolves eagerly anticipated but filled me with dread. As omegas in an Alpha-dominated pack, we survived by staying invisible. A mate would change everything, especially if he was from a higher rank.
    “Mom, don’t worry about it,” I said between bites. “The chances of me finding my mate anytime soon are slim. There are plenty of omegas who never find theirs.”
    She sat across from me, concern etched across her face. “That’s what worries me, Elara. We need protection in this pack. If something happened to me—”
    “Nothing is going to happen to you,” I cut her off firmly. I couldn’t even entertain the thought of losing her too.
    “Just promise me you’ll be open to the possibility. Not all Alphas are cruel or dismissive of omegas.”
    I nodded, though I remained unconvinced. In the Silver Moon Pack, I’d seen how most Alphas treated those they considered beneath them. My strategy of blending in had worked so far. Why change it?
    “I should go,” I said, grabbing my backpack. “I want to get to the library before class.”
    My mother smiled, though worry still clouded her eyes. “Have a good day, sweetheart. Be safe.”
    The walk to campus took fifteen minutes. I kept my head down, avoiding eye contact with the pack members I passed. At the university gates, I took a deep breath. Another day of pretending to be invisible.
    “Elara!” A cheerful voice cut through my thoughts. Seraphina Hayes waved enthusiastically from the steps of the main building. Unlike me, Sera embraced attention with her designer clothes and perfect makeup. As the daughter of wealthy beta wolves, she had the luxury of standing out.
    “Hey, Sera,” I said, adjusting my glasses unnecessarily. “You’re early again,” she complained playfully, linking her arm through mine. “One of these days, I’m going to convince you to skip the library and have fun instead. I smiled despite myself. “And risk missing notes for Professor Wilson’s class? No thanks. As we walked to class, Sera chattered about weekend plans and parties I would never attend. I nodded at appropriate intervals, but my mind was elsewhere. The library hadn’t been my actual destination. I just needed the extra time to mentally prepare for another day of careful invisibility. In the lecture hall, we took seats near the back. I preferred corners, where fewer people could see me, but Sera insisted on being at least somewhat centrally located. As other students filtered in, I noticed a group of girls whispering excitedly a few rows ahead. He was with Amber last weekend,” one said. “But it meant nothing. Rhys Knight doesn’t do relationships. Did you see him at training yesterday? Those arms should be illegal,” another sighed dreamily.
    I tried not to listen, but the name caught my attention. Rhys Knight – the Head Alpha’s son, future leader of our pack, and the campus “bad boy” everyone either feared or desired. I’d never spoken to him, but I’d seen him around – dark, mysterious, always surrounded by his “Power Gang” of fellow alpha wolves.
    My heart did a strange little skip whenever I thought about him, a reaction I ruthlessly suppressed. Someone like Rhys Knight wouldn’t even notice someone like me existed – and that was exactly how I wanted it.
    Professor Wilson’s arrival silenced the gossip, and I lost myself in taking detailed notes. When class ended, my phone vibrated with a text from Liam Thorne, captain of our rival school’s basketball team and one of my few friends.
    Meet me at the court in 10? Need help with the chem problem set.
    I texted back a quick confirmation. Liam was easy to be around – kind, smart, and never made me feel like the lowly omega I was.
    “Gotta go,” I told Sera. “Liam needs help with chemistry.”
    Sera wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. “Chemistry, huh? Are you sure that’s all he’s interested in?”
    “Stop it,” I mumbled, feeling heat rise to my cheeks. “We’re just friends.”
    
    “If you say so. Text me later!” She bounced off toward her next class, leaving me to navigate the crowded hallway alone.
    
    The basketball court was on the other side of campus. I hurried, keeping my head down and my books clutched tightly to my chest. As I approached the outdoor court, I noticed a group of basketball players but didn’t see Liam among them.
    
    “Well, look who it is,” one of them called out as I hesitated at the edge of the court. “Little omega nerd alert!”
    
    My cheeks burned as they snickered. I turned to leave, deciding to text Liam that I’d meet him at the library instead. In my haste to escape, I didn’t notice the person rounding the corner until I crashed right into them.
    
    My books tumbled to the ground as I bounced off what felt like a brick wall of muscle. Strong hands gripped my upper arms, steadying me. I looked up – way up – into the dark, intense eyes of Rhys Knight himself.
    
    My heart stopped, then raced double-time. His scent – pine, musk, and something dangerously wild – overwhelmed my senses. Up close, he was even more breathtaking – sharp jawline, full lips now quirked in surprise, and those eyes that seemed to see right through my carefully constructed façade.
    
    I couldn’t move and speak. I was trapped in the gaze of the one person I’d tried hardest to avoid.
    ...
    
    ""I-I'm so sorry,"" I stammered, finally finding my voice as I stared up at Rhys Knight. My heart pounded against my ribcage like it was trying to escape.
    
    His dark eyes bored into mine for another moment before he released my arms. The loss of contact felt strangely disappointing.
    
    ""Whatever,"" he muttered, stepping around me and continuing on his way.
    
    I let out the breath I didn't know I'd been holding and knelt to gather my scattered books. My hands trembled slightly as I collected them, mind racing with confusion over what had just happened.
    
    ""Need help with those, Omega?""
    
    I looked up to see Rowan Miller smirking down at me, his tone making the word 'omega' sound like an insult. He was one of the basketball players who'd been taunting me earlier.
    
    ""No, thanks,"" I replied quietly, clutching my books to my chest and standing up.
    
    ""Aw, don't be like that,"" Rowan said, stepping closer. ""I'm just being friendly. Not everyone gets to bump into the mighty Rhys Knight and live to tell about it."" His friends chuckled behind him.
    
    I took a step back. ""I need to go.""
    
    ""What's the rush? Maybe you're looking for an alpha to take care of you? Is that why you crashed into Knight?"" He reached out to touch my hair, and I flinched away.
    
    ""Leave her alone, Miller.""
    
    The deep voice that cut through the tension belonged to none other than Rhys Knight, who had apparently turned back around. He stood a few feet away, arms crossed over his chest, expression unreadable but somehow threatening.
    
    Rowan immediately stepped back. ""Hey, Knight, we were just—""
    
    ""We don't have time for your nonsense,"" Rhys interrupted, his tone cold. ""Coach wants us on the court. Now.""
    
    Rowan's face flushed with embarrassment as he nodded quickly and jogged back to the basketball court, his friends following like obedient puppies.
    
    Rhys didn't look at me again. He simply turned and walked away, leaving me standing there in shocked silence.
    
    Did Rhys Knight just... defend me? The same Rhys Knight who was known for his cold indifference to anyone not in his inner circle? I couldn't make sense of it.
    
    ""Did you see that?""
    ""Why would Rhys help her?""
    ""Who is she anyway?""
    
    The whispers from nearby girls reached my ears, making me want to disappear even more. This was exactly what I'd been trying to avoid – attention. And now I had it, thanks to Rhys's unexpected intervention.
    
    ""Elara! There you are!""
    
    I turned to see Liam Thorne jogging toward me, his friendly smile a welcome sight. Tall with sandy brown hair and warm hazel eyes, Liam was one of the few people at university who treated me like a normal person rather than just an omega.
    
    ""Sorry I'm late,"" he said, slowing to a stop beside me. ""Coach kept us longer than expected.""
    
    ""It's fine,"" I replied, adjusting my glasses nervously. ""I just got here myself.""
    
    His eyes flicked to where Rhys was now walking onto the basketball court. ""Everything okay? You look a little shaken.""
    
    ""I'm fine."" I forced a smile. ""Just bumped into someone, that's all.""
    
    Liam didn't look convinced, but he nodded. ""Let's head to the library, then? I'm completely lost on those oxidation equations.""
    
    As we walked away from the courts, I could feel eyes on my back. Whether they belonged to Rhys or the curious onlookers, I wasn't sure. Either way, I wanted nothing more than to fade back into invisibility.
    
    ""So, how's the team looking this season?"" I asked, desperate to change the subject in my own mind.
    
    Liam grinned proudly. ""The Crimson Hawks are stronger than ever. We're going to crush the Silver Wolves in the championship.""
    
    I smiled at his enthusiasm. As captain of our rival university's basketball team, Liam had a friendly rivalry with our school's team – the team Rhys Knight happened to lead.
    
    ""You seem pretty confident,"" I remarked.
    
    ""We've been practicing new plays. Knight won't know what hit him.""
    
    The mention of Rhys sent an unexpected flutter through my stomach that I quickly suppressed. ""Well, I'll be cheering for you.""
    
    ""You'd better be,"" he teased, bumping my shoulder lightly with his.
    
    At the library, we found a quiet corner table and spread out our books. Chemistry came easily to me, and explaining it to Liam gave me something to focus on besides the strange encounter with Rhys.
    
    ""You make it sound so simple,"" Liam said after I walked him through a particularly complex problem.
    
    I shrugged. ""It just takes practice.""
    
    ""And a brain like yours."" His smile was warm, appreciative. ""Seriously, Elara, you're brilliant. You should be more confident about it.""
    
    Before I could respond, a familiar voice called out. ""There you are!""
    
    Seraphina Hayes approached our table, her designer heels clicking against the library floor. Behind her trailed Debra Chang, another friend from our small circle.
    
    ""We've been looking everywhere for you,"" Sera continued, sliding into the chair next to mine while Debra took the one across from her.
    
    ""We're trying to study here,"" I pointed out, though I couldn't help but smile at her dramatic entrance.
    
    ""Study, schmuddy,"" Sera waved her hand dismissively. ""There are more important things to discuss."" She turned to Liam with a bright smile. ""Hey, Thorne. Looking good as always.""
    
    Liam chuckled. ""Hayes. Still subtle as a freight train, I see.""
    
    ""That's why you love me,"" she replied with a wink before turning back to me. ""So, have you heard the news?""
    
    ""What news?"" I asked cautiously.
    
    ""Liam's throwing a party tonight!"" Sera announced, as if revealing the secret to eternal life.
    
    I glanced at Liam, who shrugged. ""Just a small get-together at my place. My parents are out of town.""
    
    ""Small?"" Sera scoffed. ""Half the university is talking about it.""
    
    ""You're exaggerating,"" Liam said, though he looked pleased.
    
    ""Am I?"" Sera raised an eyebrow. ""Anyway, we're all going. Right, Elara?""
    
    I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. ""I don't know. My mom has that rule about weeknight parties, and you know I'm not really the party type.""
    
    ""Oh, come on!"" Sera pleaded. ""It's Friday night, and you never do anything fun. One party won't kill you.""
    
    ""She's right,"" Debra chimed in quietly. ""We all need to unwind sometimes.""
    
    I chewed my lower lip, considering. My mother would worry, but she'd also been encouraging me to socialize more. And if Sera and Debra were there, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
    
    Liam leaned forward. ""I'd really like you to come, Elara. It wouldn't be the same without you.""
    
    His sincerity made me pause. Unlike most alphas and betas, Liam had always been kind to me, never treating me differently because of my omega status. We'd met in Advanced Calculus last year, and he'd sought my help with statistics ever since.
    
    ""I'll think about it,"" I finally said.
    
    Sera clapped her hands excitedly. ""That's practically a yes from Elara! We'll pick you up at eight.""
    
    ""I didn't say—""
    
    ""It'll be fun, I promise,"" Liam cut in. ""Just casual, nothing crazy. You can leave whenever you want.""
    
    The bell rang, signaling the end of our free period. We gathered our books, and I couldn't help but feel a growing sense of dread mixed with a tiny spark of excitement.
    
    ""See you tonight,"" Liam called as he headed off to his next class.
    
    Sera linked her arm with mine as we walked to our Literature lecture. ""This is going to be so good for you, Elara. You need to get out more.""
    
    ""I get out plenty,"" I protested weakly.
    
    ""The library and the coffee shop don't count,"" she countered. ""Plus, I heard some of the Silver Wolves basketball team might show up."" She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.
    
    My stomach dropped. ""The Silver Wolves? As in Rhys Knight's team?""
    
    ""The very same. Exciting, right?""
    
    It wasn't exciting. It was terrifying. After this morning's encounter, the last thing I wanted was to be in the same room as Rhys Knight again. But I couldn't tell Sera that without explaining what had happened, and I wasn't ready to discuss the strange feelings that had surfaced when he touched me.
    
    ""I'm still not sure I should go,"" I tried again as we slid into our seats.
    
    ""Too late!"" Sera sing-songed. ""I've already decided what we're wearing.""
    
    The rest of the day passed in a blur of lectures and assignments, but my mind kept drifting back to Rhys. Why had he stepped in to help me? It made no sense. Alphas like him didn't concern themselves with omegas like me. That was the natural order of things in our pack, and I'd accepted it long ago.
    
    By the time I got home that afternoon, I'd convinced myself that he hadn't been helping me specifically – he probably just wanted Rowan on the court for practice. That had to be it.
    
    ""Mom?"" I called as I entered our modest two-bedroom house.
    
    No answer. She must still be at the pack hospital. As the pack's most skilled doctor, she often worked late hours.
    
    I headed upstairs to my room, dropping my backpack on the bed and staring at my closet. What did one wear to a party they didn't want to attend?
    
    My phone buzzed with a text from Sera.
    
    Sera: Be there in an hour. Have your party outfit ready!
    
    I sighed, opening my closet to survey the limited options. Oversized sweaters, loose jeans, plain t-shirts – my entire wardrobe was designed to help me blend into the background.
    
    Another text.
    
    Sera: And don't even THINK about wearing one of your baggy sweaters. This is a PARTY!
    
    I couldn't help but smile. Sera knew me too well.
    
    Forty-five minutes later, there was a knock at my door. I opened it to find Sera standing there, looking gorgeous in a fitted red dress and heels, with Debra beside her in stylish black pants and a shimmering top.
    
    ""Where's your outfit?"" Sera demanded, pushing past me into the house.
    
    ""I was just about to change,"" I lied.
    
    Sera's perfectly shaped eyebrows rose skeptically. ""Show me what you picked.""
    
    I hesitated, then gestured vaguely to the jeans and blouse laid out on my bed.
    
    Sera looked horrified. ""Oh no, no, no. This won't do at all. Let me see your options.""
    
    Before I could protest, she was rifling through my closet, making disapproving noises.
    
    ""Don't you own anything remotely... party-appropriate?"" she asked, pushing hangers aside with increasing desperation.
    
    ""I told you parties aren't my thing,"" I reminded her.
    
    Sera turned to face me, hands on her hips. ""Well, tonight they are. Lucky for you, I always come prepared.""
    
    She held up a shopping bag I hadn't noticed she was carrying. ""I had a feeling we might need backup.""
    
    ""What's that?"" I asked suspiciously.
    
    ""Your ticket to having fun tonight,"" Sera replied with a mischievous grin. ""Now sit down and let me work my magic.""
    
    As Sera emptied the bag of makeup and accessories onto my bed, I felt a mix of panic and a strange sort of curiosity. Maybe one night of not being invisible wouldn't be so bad.
    
    ""Fine,"" I conceded. ""But I'm not staying out late, and I'm definitely not drinking.""
    
    ""We'll see,"" Sera said with a wink. ""By the time I'm done with you, you might not want to leave early after all.""
    
    I highly doubted that, but as Sera pulled out a stunning emerald green top that would match my eyes perfectly, I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to be noticed for once – to step out of the shadows and into the light. Even if just for one night.
    ...
    ""Are you absolutely sure about this?"" I asked for what must have been the tenth time as I tugged at the hem of my sweater.
    
    Seraphina rolled her eyes dramatically as she rummaged through her oversized purse. ""Yes, Elara. For the millionth time, yes. Now stop fidgeting. You look fine.""
    
    Despite her reassurance, I couldn't help but feel exposed. After our earlier makeover attempt, I'd managed to convince Sera to let me wear my usual baggy jeans and an oversized gray sweater. My small victory in our fashion standoff.
    
    ""Fine isn't exactly party material,"" Sera muttered, finally pulling out a long black coat. ""Here, at least wear this. It has style, which is more than I can say for..."" She gestured vaguely at my entire outfit with a despairing look.
    
    I took the coat gratefully. ""Thanks. Not all of us can pull off skin-tight dresses like you.""
    
    ""You absolutely could if you tried,"" she countered, adjusting her own red dress that hugged every curve perfectly. ""But I know when I'm fighting a losing battle. For now.""
    
    The ominous way she said ""for now"" sent a little shiver down my spine. Sera never truly gave up on a mission.
    
    ""Ready?"" she asked, dangling her car keys.
    
    I nodded reluctantly. My mother had surprisingly given permission for me to go out, practically shoving me out the door with instructions to ""have fun for once."" Even my own mother thought I needed a life.
    
    The drive to Liam's house was short but felt eternal as my anxiety built with each passing minute. Liam lived in the more affluent part of town, where the houses were more like small mansions. His father was the Alpha of a neighboring pack, and their family had business interests that extended beyond pack affairs.
    
    As we pulled up to the impressive house, I could already hear the thump of music. Colorful lights flashed from inside, and cars lined both sides of the street.
    
    ""Small get-together, huh?"" I remarked dryly, eyeing the dozens of people visible through the windows.
    
    Sera grinned. ""It'll be fun! Come on!""
    
    She practically dragged me from the car and up the walkway. The front door was already open, people spilling in and out. The smell of alcohol, perfume, and that distinct scent of too many werewolves in one space hit me immediately.
    
    Inside was chaos. The living room had been transformed into something resembling a nightclub, with furniture pushed aside to create a dance floor where bodies moved to the pulsing rhythm. The lights were low except for colorful strobes, and smoke from a fog machine created an otherworldly atmosphere.
    
    ""Wow,"" I breathed, feeling immediately overwhelmed. ""This is... a lot.""
    
    Sera beamed. ""Isn't it great? Let's find Debra!""
    
    We navigated through the crowd, Sera confidently parting the sea of people while I tried to make myself as small as possible behind her. The music was so loud I could feel it vibrating in my chest, making it hard to hear anything else.
    
    ""Sera! Elara!"" Debra's voice somehow cut through the noise. She appeared in front of us, looking more relaxed than I'd ever seen her, a red cup in hand. ""You made it!""
    
    ""Of course we did!"" Sera shouted back over the music. ""Where's Liam?""
    
    ""Last I saw, he was by the pool,"" Debra replied, gesturing toward the back of the house. ""The real party's out there.""
    
    We followed her through the house, passing groups of laughing, drinking people. I recognized faces from school, mostly upper-ranking betas and alphas. Very few omegas attended parties like this unless they were with their mates. It was just another unspoken pack hierarchy thing.
    
    The backyard was just as crowded as inside, centered around a large, illuminated pool. String lights hung overhead, creating a softer glow than the harsh strobes indoors. A DJ was set up on one side, though the music was slightly less deafening out here.
    
    ""I'll go find Liam,"" Sera announced. ""He'll want to know you're here, Elara.""
    
    Before I could protest, she disappeared into the crowd, leaving me with Debra.
    
    ""So, having fun yet?"" Debra asked with a knowing smile.
    
    ""I just got here,"" I pointed out, wrapping Sera's coat tighter around me despite the warm evening.
    
    ""Want a drink? It might help you loosen up.""
    
    I shook my head. ""I'm good, thanks.""
    
    Debra shrugged. ""Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, there's plenty in the kitchen.""
    
    A burst of laughter from the far side of the pool caught our attention. A crowd had formed around what appeared to be some kind of game. People were clapping and cheering.
    
    ""What's going on over there?"" I asked, curiosity temporarily overriding my discomfort.
    
    ""Oh, they're playing blind man's buff,"" Debra replied with a smirk. ""Adult version, of course.""
    
    ""Adult version?""
    
    ""Come on, I'll show you.""
    
    Against my better judgment, I followed Debra closer to the circle of onlookers. As we approached, I could see what had drawn the crowd. In the center of the circle stood a blindfolded figure – tall, muscular, and unmistakable even with his eyes covered.
    
    Rhys Knight.
    
    My heart stuttered in my chest. He was shirtless except for a black sleeveless jacket that hung open, revealing his chiseled torso. The blindfold was a strip of black fabric tied around his eyes, and he was grinning in a way that made my mouth go dry.
    
    ""The rules are simple,"" a guy I recognized as Ethan Croft was explaining loudly. ""Our blindfolded Alpha has to catch someone. Whoever gets caught has to take a dare or..."" He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, earning hoots and hollers from the crowd.
    
    Girls around the circle were giggling, some deliberately placing themselves in Rhys's path before dancing away when he got close. It was like watching a predator and prey game, except the prey was eagerly hoping to be caught.
    
    ""Most people want to be caught,"" Debra whispered to me with a laugh. ""Rhys hasn't participated in party games for ages. This is a rare opportunity.""
    
    I swallowed hard, unable to tear my eyes away from Rhys as he moved with surprising grace despite the blindfold. His head titled occasionally, and I realized he was using his heightened werewolf senses to track movement and scents.
    
    ""Why would he agree to this?"" I whispered back.
    
    Debra shrugged. ""Who knows? Maybe he's in a good mood. Or maybe he has someone specific he wants to catch.""
    
    The crowd shifted and parted as Rhys lunged toward a squealing girl who barely escaped his grasp. The movement pushed me forward slightly, closer to the center than I wanted to be. I tried to step back, but people had filled in behind me.
    
    Suddenly, Rhys paused. His head lifted, nostrils flaring slightly. Then he turned, with deliberate slowness, in my direction.
    
    My heart pounded so loudly I was sure everyone could hear it. For a terrifying moment, I thought he might have caught my scent, but that was impossible with so many people around and the smell of chlorine from the pool.
    
    Still, he moved toward me with purpose, like a missile locked on target.
    
    ""Step back,"" I hissed to the people behind me, but they were too engrossed in the spectacle to move.
    
    Rhys was only a few feet away now. I could see the slight smirk playing at his lips, the confidence in his stance. He thought he knew exactly who he was approaching.
    
    I needed to move. Now.
    
    I tried to sidestep, but someone's elbow knocked me slightly forward instead. Before I could recover, Rhys's hand shot out with inhuman speed and precision, catching my wrist.
    
    The touch was electric. His fingers closed around my wrist firmly but not painfully, and with one smooth tug, he pulled me against his chest.
    
    The crowd fell silent.
    
    I froze, my face inches from his bare skin, my body pressed against his. Heat radiated from him, along with that intoxicating scent that had haunted me since our encounter that morning.
    
    His other arm snaked around my waist, securing me against him. I could feel every hard plane of his body, every breath he took.
    
    ""Gotcha,"" he murmured, his voice a low rumble that I felt more than heard.
    
    Then his head dipped slightly, his nose skimming near my hair as he inhaled deeply.
    
    The silence stretched for what felt like eternity. No one moved. No one spoke.
    
    Slowly, Rhys reached up with one hand and pulled off the blindfold, clearly expecting to see one of his admirers.
    
    Instead, his dark eyes met mine, widening with shock.
    
    I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. Couldn't think.
    
    In that moment, with Rhys's arm still around my waist and his eyes locked on mine, the rest of the world seemed to disappear. There was only the thundering of my heart and the inexplicable intensity in his gaze.
    
    What happened next would change everything.
    ...
    I stood frozen as Rhys's dark eyes widened with recognition. The arm around my waist stiffened, and a flash of something unreadable crossed his face before his lips curled into a sneer.
    
    ""You've got to be kidding me,"" he muttered, dropping my hand like it burned him.
    
    The crowd erupted in laughter. The sound crashed over me like a wave, drowning me in humiliation. My cheeks burned as I took a stumbling step backward, desperate to escape.
    
    ""What's the nerd doing here?"" someone called out.
    
    ""Wrong catch, Alpha!"" another voice jeered.
    
    Rhys's expression had morphed completely from the seductive smirk he'd worn moments ago. He looked at me with thinly veiled disgust, as if he'd found something unpleasant stuck to his shoe.
    
    ""I didn't realize this was bring-your-charity-case night,"" he drawled, loud enough for everyone to hear.
    
    More laughter. I wanted to disappear, to sink into the ground or evaporate into the night air. Anything to escape the mocking eyes surrounding me.
    
    ""She's here because I invited her.""
    
    The voice cut through the laughter like a knife. Liam Thorne stepped forward, his tall frame slicing a path through the crowd until he stood between Rhys and me.
    
    ""Got a problem with that, Knight?"" Liam's voice was calm, but there was steel beneath the words.
    
    The crowd fell silent again, tension crackling in the air. Everyone knew the rivalry between Liam and Rhys extended beyond the basketball court. Two alphas from different packs, neither willing to back down.
    
    Rhys's eyes narrowed dangerously. ""Didn't realize you were into charity work, Thorne. First befriending nerds, what's next? Setting up a shelter for stray omegas?""
    
    My stomach twisted painfully at the dig. Being an omega in a predominantly alpha pack was hard enough without the constant reminders of how everyone viewed us—as lesser, as unwanted.
    
    Liam took a step closer to Rhys. ""Maybe if you spent less time being an asshole and more time getting to know people, you'd realize Elara has more to offer than most of the mindless groupies you surround yourself with.""
    
    I tugged at Liam's arm, wishing he would stop. His defense only made me more visible, more of a spectacle.
    
    ""Liam, it's fine,"" I whispered urgently. ""Let's just go.""
    
    Rhys's gaze flicked between Liam's hand on my arm and my face. ""Listen to your pet nerd, Thorne. Walk away before this gets messy.""
    
    The air grew heavy with alpha pheromones as both boys squared off. People started backing up, giving them space for what everyone assumed would be an inevitable fight.
    
    ""Alright, enough with the testosterone contest,"" a voice cut in. Julian Mercer, one of Rhys's circle but known for his level head, stepped between them. ""It's a party, remember? Save the pissing match for the court.""
    
    For a tense moment, neither Rhys nor Liam moved. Then Rhys's shoulders relaxed slightly, and he gave a dismissive shrug.
    
    ""Whatever. The game was getting boring anyway."" His eyes slid over me one last time, lingering just long enough to make my skin prickle, before he turned away. ""Ethan, get me a drink.""
    
    As quickly as it had begun, the spectacle was over. The crowd dispersed, music resumed its dominance over conversation, and I was left standing with Liam, my heart hammering against my ribs.
    
    ""I'm sorry about that,"" Liam said quietly, genuine concern in his eyes. ""Are you okay?""
    
    I nodded stiffly, though I was anything but okay. ""You didn't have to defend me.""
    
    ""Yes, I did. Rhys is a jerk who needs to be called out more often."" Liam ran a hand through his dark hair. ""Don't let him ruin your night. Come on, let's get something to drink—non-alcoholic,"" he added with a smile.
    
    I followed Liam away from the pool area, grateful for his steady presence but acutely aware of the stares and whispers that trailed behind us. My brief moment as the center of attention had firmly cemented my status as the party's oddity.
    
    ""Here,"" Liam handed me a can of soda once we reached a quieter corner. ""Sealed and safe.""
    
    ""Thanks."" I took a sip, hoping the cold liquid would ease the tightness in my throat. ""For everything, I mean.""
    
    ""Don't mention it."" His smile was warm, genuine. ""I'm glad you came tonight, despite... well, despite Rhys being Rhys.""
    
    I glanced across the yard to where Rhys had rejoined his friends, his arm now draped casually over Ethan's shoulder as they laughed about something. Despite everything, I couldn't help noticing how the colored lights played across his features, highlighting the sharp angles of his face.
    
    ""I should find Seraphina,"" I said, pulling my gaze away from Rhys. ""She disappeared when we got here.""
    
    ""Last I saw her, she was dancing inside. Do you want me to come with you?""
    
    I shook my head. ""I've caused enough drama for one night. I'll be fine.""
    
    Liam looked uncertain but nodded. ""If you're sure. I need to check on something with the DJ anyway. Find me if you need anything, okay?""
    
    After he left, I made my way back inside, navigating through the throng of dancing bodies. Seraphina was nowhere to be found, probably chatting up some handsome beta or alpha as she usually did at parties. With little else to do, I found an empty spot on a couch and sank into it, content to watch the party unfold around me.
    
    From my vantage point, I could see through the large glass doors to the pool area. My eyes, betraying me, found Rhys immediately. He was leaning against the bar, a red cup in hand, his attention focused on someone I couldn't see.
    
    As the crowd shifted, I caught sight of his object of interest—a girl in a white bikini that left little to the imagination. She was beautiful in that perfect, airbrushed way that made ordinary girls like me feel invisible. Long blonde hair cascaded down her back, and even from a distance, I could see her flirtatious smile as she approached Rhys.
    
    Lyra Winters. Of course. Head cheerleader, beta wolf, and exactly the type of girl someone like Rhys would go for.
    
    I watched as she sauntered toward the pool, casting provocative glances over her shoulder at Rhys. With deliberate slowness, she descended into the water, the movement causing her body to arch in a way that drew every male eye in the vicinity.
    
    Rhys followed her with his gaze, a predatory smirk playing on his lips. When she beckoned to him from the water, he set down his drink and removed his jacket, exposing his muscled torso fully before diving into the pool after her.
    
    Something twisted painfully in my chest as I watched them. Within moments, Lyra had her arms around his neck, her body pressed against his in the water, her laugh carrying across the yard.
    
    It shouldn't have bothered me. It shouldn't have mattered at all. Rhys Knight was nothing to me—just an arrogant alpha who'd humiliated me more than once today.
    
    Yet there I sat, an inexplicable ache spreading through me as I watched him pull Lyra closer in the pool, his hands disappearing beneath the water as she threw her head back in pleasure.
    
    ""Having fun?"" Seraphina's voice startled me.
    
    I tore my eyes away from the pool scene to find her standing in front of me, two cups in hand.
    
    ""Loads,"" I replied dryly. ""Where have you been?""
    
    ""Making connections,"" she said with a wink, handing me one of the cups. ""Relax, it's just punch. Virgin,"" she added when she saw my hesitation.
    
    I took a small sip, the sweet fruity taste confirming her claim. ""I think I want to leave soon.""
    
    Sera frowned, settling beside me on the couch. ""Already? We just got here.""
    
    ""I don't belong here, Sera. That was made abundantly clear a few minutes ago."" I briefly recounted the blind man's buff incident.
    
    ""So Rhys Knight is a dick. This isn't exactly breaking news."" She nudged my shoulder. ""But Liam stood up for you. That's something, right?""
    
    ""It just made everything worse,"" I sighed. ""More attention, more people staring.""
    
    ""Not everyone is staring at you for the reasons you think,"" Sera said cryptically.
    
    Before I could ask what she meant, a burst of laughter drew our attention back to the pool. Rhys had Lyra pressed against the pool wall now, his mouth at her neck while her legs wrapped around his waist under the water.
    
    The ache in my chest intensified, spreading through my body like poison. I couldn't explain it, couldn't understand why watching Rhys with another girl hurt so much when I barely knew him and what I did know was awful.
    
    ""Stop torturing yourself,"" Sera said softly, following my gaze. ""He's not worth it.""
    
    ""I'm not—"" I began, but stopped. What was the point in denying what was clearly written all over my face?
    
    Outside, Rhys lifted his head from Lyra's neck, and for a heart-stopping moment, his eyes locked directly with mine through the glass doors. Something flashed in his dark gaze—recognition, perhaps even satisfaction at catching me watching him.
    
    Then his attention returned to Lyra, his smirk widening as he whispered something in her ear that made her giggle and tighten her legs around him.
    
    I looked away, the ache in my chest threatening to choke me.
    
    ""Fine,"" I said to Seraphina, draining my cup in one go. ""Let's stay a bit longer. But I'm not watching that show anymore.""
    
    Sera grinned, linking her arm through mine as she pulled me to my feet. ""That's my girl. Come on, let's dance. Nothing cures heartache like making someone else jealous.""
    
    ""I'm not heartbroken,"" I protested weakly as she dragged me toward the dance floor.
    
    But the persistent ache in my chest suggested otherwise, and I couldn't help wondering why, of all the people in the world, Rhys Knight had the power to make me feel this way when he'd done nothing but treat me with contempt.
    
    As Seraphina pulled me into the crowd of dancers, I forced myself not to look back toward the pool, though I could still feel Rhys's eyes on me like a physical touch, burning into my skin from across the room.
    ...
    I couldn't tear my eyes away as Lyra pressed a lingering kiss to Rhys's cheek, her perfectly manicured fingers trailing down his chest. She whispered something in his ear that made him smirk before they disappeared into the house together, his hand resting possessively on her lower back.
    
    My stomach twisted with an emotion I refused to name. I had no right to feel this way. Rhys Knight meant nothing to me. He was cruel, arrogant, and had publicly humiliated me twice in one day. Yet watching him with Lyra made my chest ache in a way I couldn't explain.

Long before freeways and franchise coffee shops, this land was governed under a different flag. Through war, treaties like the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the steady march of Manifest Destiny, the borders shifted — not because of divine fate, but because of power, politics, and conquest. That’s not an opinion; that’s a historical fact.

So when folks argue today about “who belongs where,” it begs a real question: **What defines ownership of land — the culture, the people, the paperwork, or the power that claimed it?** It’s easy to scream about patriotism while ignoring the uncomfortable truths beneath the soil we stand on. History isn’t always flattering. It’s layered, full of contradiction, and often written by those who won. And yet, acknowledging those truths doesn’t make you less American — it makes you a more informed one.

I say this with complete love and loyalty to my country — the United States — a place that gave me freedom, opportunity, and voice. But loving your country doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to the past. It means being honest enough to ask hard questions and humble enough to know we didn’t always get it right. That’s not weakness — that’s wisdom. That’s strength. And in a time when everyone’s quick to argue but slow to reflect, **a little historical awareness might be the most patriotic thing we can practice.**

It’s not about having the latest graphics card, the highest watt CPU, or specs that sound like they came from a NASA checklist.

It’s about knowing exactly what matters for *real* daily use.

Today, you’ll see the most common mistake that ruins the gaming laptop experience for thousands of people.

You’ll learn why spending more doesn’t mean gaming better.

And you’ll find out how to avoid the trap that catches almost every new buyer.

Let’s get into it.

# The expensive gaming laptop myth

Everyone says higher specs mean a better experience.

But after trying high-end laptops, mid-tier models, and budget picks, there’s one thing that stands out.

The extra money rarely changes your actual day-to-day experience.

Most of that “extra” performance gets wasted as heat, fan noise, and battery drain.

# Overkill hardware causes real-world problems

A lot of people think future-proofing means spending double or triple.

What actually happens is:

* Your “portable” laptop feels more like a desktop  
* Battery life becomes a joke  
* Your lap turns into a frying pan  
* Coffee shops turn into a concert of fan noise  

All this for a few more frames you barely notice in real gameplay.

# Even the most expensive models slow down

Thermal throttling is everywhere.

You push your laptop, it gets hot, performance drops.

It’s not just the cheap models.

Even the ones with giant price tags eventually slow down under real load.

The result?

You pay more for something that barely keeps up under stress.

# Battery life, portability, and actual fun

What most people want is a laptop that can play games well, last through a class or work session, and not make them the weird person with a giant power brick.

Cheaper models do this better.

Less heat, less noise, less stress.

I think a lot of us get fooled by the hype and miss out on what makes laptops actually enjoyable to use.

Is anyone else done chasing specs?

Has anyone gone from ultra high-end to budget and been happier?

What matters *most* to you in a gaming laptop now?

Here’s what helped me cut down \~$350 last month:

1. **Bought a secondhand coffee maker** I used to grab $4–5 coffee 4–5x a week. Picked up a $20 used drip machine and $12 bag of beans — now each cup is like 40 cents and tastes better.
2.  **Walked instead of Ubering everywhere** If it’s under 1.5 miles, I walk it. Saved $70+ this month alone. Also helps force me outside between classes.
3.  **Used**[ ](https://rapidetuto.com)**rapidetuto to find actual working coupon codes** Stopped using Honey — most codes never work anyway. I’ve been checking Rapidetuto before any online order — saved $8 on groceries, $12 on an event ticket, and even $5 off a textbook site.
4. **Cut down to one streaming service** I canceled Netflix and kept Spotify Student. If I really want to watch something, I just share screens on Discord with friends. It’s janky but it works.
5.  **Started budgeting using Notion** I use a free Notion template that tracks income, spending, goals, and side gigs. Helps me see where the leaks are and avoid dumb spending.

Nothing groundbreaking, but this has been my best financial month since starting school. Hope it helps someone else out.

For months, I’d been practicing NSDR—the now popular “non-sleep deep rest” protocol shared by Andrew Huberman.
It gave me some relief. A small window of calm. But the effect was short-lived—like taking the edge off without really addressing what lay beneath.
It didn’t touch the chaos I was carrying inside.

Then I discovered something that changed everything—
NSDR is based on Yoga Nidra, an ancient practice of deep, conscious rest.
So I decided to go to the source.

That first real Yoga Nidra session wasn’t just “relaxing”—it undid me.

Midway through, something cracked open.
Tears came—not from sadness, but from relief.
For the first time in years, I wasn’t just managing my stress—I was releasing it.

The stillness wasn't empty.
It held me.
It heard me.

I stayed in that silence even after the recording ended. And when I eventually fell asleep, I didn’t drag myself out of bed the next morning. I jumped out. Rested. Recovered. Energized.
It was the first time in a decade that I felt I had actually slept.

And something else happened.
I stopped craving caffeine. I skipped my usual coffee ritual at work—not out of discipline, but because the calm from Yoga Nidra was enough.
My heart rate slowed. My thoughts softened. And for brief moments during the day, I’d close my eyes and slip into that same stillness—no effort, just being.

This practice didn’t just relax me. It rewired something fundamental.

If NSDR isn’t quite reaching you, go deeper.
Yoga Nidra isn’t a productivity hack—it’s a return.
To the body.
To the breath.
To the self.

I didn’t expect healing.
But I found it anyway.

It wasn’t a huge deal or anything, but the whole situation left me feeling a little unsure. I’m hoping for some outside perspective because I genuinely can’t tell if I handled it well or if I stepped into territory that wasn’t mine.

I was on a road trip and stopped at a truck stop in a pretty sketchy part of a small rural town. The kind of place where you can tell there’s a lot of crime and folks keep their guard up. The parking lot was cracked and uneven, the building looked worn down, and there was a shelf full of faded American flag hats by the register. I went into the bathroom just to wash my hands and regroup before getting back on the road.

While I was at the sink, two young boys came in with their toddler sister. I’d guess the boys were around five and maybe nine years old, give or take. There were no adults with them, so I figured they were on sibling duty, trying to help their little sister use the restroom. It was kind of sweet, honestly. They were clearly taking it seriously.

When they saw me, they froze. I didn’t feel threatened or anything, but I could tell the older boy was a little uncomfortable. The younger one seemed curious but also unsure. I’ve seen that look before. I’m intersex, and I don’t really fit into what most people expect when they think about who’s supposed to be in a women’s or men’s bathroom. So I can understand why two young kids might be confused for a second.

I didn’t want them to feel uncomfortable or like they were doing something wrong, so I gently let them know it was okay that they were there helping their sister. And just to give them a little clarity, I mentioned that some people are just born with a mix of things, that not everyone fits neatly into one box or the other, and I’m one of those people. I said it in the simplest way possible, just a short little explanation, nothing graphic or heavy. Just enough to let them know I’m a person and they’re fine.

The younger boy seemed to take it in without much issue. The older one still looked a little hesitant but didn’t say anything more. They both eventually nodded and turned their attention back to their sister, like it wasn’t a big deal. In the moment, it felt nice that they didn’t react negatively.

But later, when I was in line for coffee, their mom came up to me. She said the boys had told her about what happened in the bathroom and wanted to apologize in case they had made me uncomfortable. I told her they were totally fine, super respectful, and that I actually appreciated the interaction.

We ended up chatting for a bit. I explained a little more — nothing intense, just that I’m intersex. She said she’d heard the word before but wasn’t really sure what it meant. She was kind about it. Like, genuinely kind. She even said something about how people come in all kinds of ways and how that might just be part of the plan, or however she phrased it. It was honestly one of the warmest responses I’ve had in that kind of situation, especially in a more conservative setting.

But even with that kindness, now that I’ve had time to think it over, I wonder if I may have overstepped some boundaries. I don’t know the family or how the parents talk to their kids about complicated topics like gender or bodies. What felt like a gentle explanation to me might have felt confusing or overwhelming to the kids, especially the older boy who seemed uncomfortable. Maybe the bathroom wasn’t the right place for that kind of conversation, and maybe I should have just kept things simple or said nothing at all.

I realize that even with good intentions, sharing personal details about my identity with kids I don’t know could have crossed a line. The last thing I wanted was to put the kids or their mom in a difficult position or make anyone feel awkward. At the same time, I didn’t want to ignore their obvious confusion or make them feel like something was wrong.

So yeah, it was a small moment in a small bathroom in a rough part of town, but now I’m kind of spiraling about it. Did I do the right thing by being honest and open? Or did I overstep by bringing up something that maybe wasn’t mine to share in that moment?

I’ve started seeing a woman who’s now my Domme. We met through a dating app,  and this whole experience has been way more real so fast than I ever expected.

We’ve been getting to know each other on a deeper level, and she’s already started taking the lead in ways that hit me right at the core of who I am. She’s literally assigning me real-life tasks. I’ll be mowing her yard this week and deep cleaning her house. Being useful to her like that feels more fulfilling than anything I’ve felt in a long time!!

We’ve gone out to dinner twice, and of course, I took care of everything. She hasn’t asked me for money or gifts, but I’ve been sending her coffee tributes from time to time just to make her smile. I feel like I want to give , to serve, to make her feel appreciated and powerful!

Would love to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar ?? Is it normal that the fantasy in my mind finally moved from fantasy to something real? plus any advices ?",5,1749656904.0,paypigsupportgroup,7,1.0,False

Recently I've been looking for a shift in career away from banking, and have decided to keep my focus local. As such, I'm interested in coming to work for the place where I live. I hear absolutely wonderful things about both places. 

I'm posting today to see if anyone can tell me their experience with the region or the city including (but not limited to):

\- How did you get in? Any tips or tricks?

\- What's your career progression been like?

\- What's the culture like?

I have a pretty diverse skill set - I'm a CPA who can do full-cycle accounting, financial planning & analysis, and I've had extensive experience in projects and data analysis. 

I've applied to a number of jobs at both places and I never seem to get past the initial screening. I'm not surprised by this - pretty much all of my applications never make it past screening even though I've optimized my resume to stand out and ""beat"" any ATS companies might be using.

1l8w24f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l8w24f/i_think_my_husband_is_a_fork_thief/,I Think My Husband is a Fork Thief,"This is a throwaway, but I need to get this out there. I (43F) think my husband (55M) is stealing forks from other peoples' houses.

Why would he do this? I have no idea. He's always been a little loose with taking things. But it usually was low stakes. A coffee table from his dorm room that was already getting new furniture when he moved out. A frame from the art store where he worked, because it was cracked on one side and was getting thrown out anyway. A single spoon from the restaurant where I worked, as a memory because we loved the soup.

When new forks started appearing, he explained that they were left at the office by coworkers, and never claimed. So he'd use one and bring it home to clean it...then never take it back.

At first, I thought having lots of different forks was fun. Quirky. Eccentric. The kids and I nickname them. The one with art deco designs is ""Roaring Twenties."" The one with a rose at the end is ""Kiss from a Rose."" One with particularly long tines is ""Throat Stabber."" And we all have our preferred forks and sometimes fight over them.

But last week, a new fork appeared out of nowhere. He doesn't go to the office anymore, so it couldn't have come from there. I really like this new fork and I haven't named it yet. It has a nice weight to it, good heft. The tines aren't too long, and they're perfectly spaced for spearing. It's probably a dessert fork (I guess? I don't know silverware), which is nice for my smaller hands. I asked my husband where it came from, and he said he had no idea. Maybe it just got shuffled in with the other forks from the office. I decided to let it go, probably because I like the fork. Does this make me complicit? Maybe.

This morning is when I am seriously considering we have a problem. Because yet another fork appeared. This one is a lot like the last, similar engravings on the handle, but not the same design. Unlike my new favorite, this one is a regular-sized fork.

Still, I thought maybe they're the same fork - my new favorite, and this one. But I got them both out, put them side by side. Different forks.

My husband went to a friend's house to hang out last night. Did he take it from there? My mind is whirling with possibilities, so I did the very un-Reddit-like thing and just asked. ""Hey, this is new. Where did it come from?"" And he shrugged. ""No idea."" I said, ""Okay, well, that's weird because I didn't bring it in. Our younger daughter didn't. Did our older daughter?"" And we kind of laughed.

But I'm onto him. I just have no way of getting proof. Also, what if I'm wrong? I suck at figuring out when people are lying.

Even though I believe my husband is the culprit, here's a list of other potential suspects: our eighteen-year-old, who sometimes goes to different friends' houses. Our fourteen-year-old, who never goes anywhere except school. I guess she could be nicking forks from friends' sack lunches? And me. I don't really go anywhere, but maybe I'm sneaking out while I sleep like some kind of somnambulistic cutlery burglar, I don't know.

I think it's my husband. As far as I can tell, that's the only explanation. And I can't go around besmirching his good name to our friends and family, so I came here to be anonymous and get it off my chest. 

If you're missing some cutlery, I guess I can check my silverware drawer for you. Even if it didn't come from your house, there's a good chance I have a match.",3,1749656737.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,1.0,False

1l8vu87,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8vu87,"JIMGU (ENOWA) - Yufuin, Japan (April 2025). The Farm-to-Table Protégé","For part 3 of protégé series in Japan, we jump to the peaceful onsen town of Yufuin in Oita Prefecture, where I had the pleasure of staying at ENOWA, a fairly new boutique luxury resort, and dined at its farm-to-table concept restaurant, JIMGU. Opened in June 2023, JIMGU has been garnering great reviews and currently boasts a Tabelog score of 3.98 and and is in the Tabelog Top 100 Restaurants for Innovative Cuisine.

JIMGU is led by Tashi Gyamtso, a Tibetan chef who has quite a storied résumé. He trained under Dan Barber at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in New York, rising to the rank of sous-chef, and further sharpened his craft with stints at a few renowed restaurants including Noma (Copenhagen), Core by Clare Smyth (London), Narisawa (Tokyo), Den (Tokyo), and Kikunoi (Kyoto), and L’Arpège (Paris).

Inspired by the farm-to-table ethos from Blue Hill, Tashi made the bold move from New York to Yufuin, with support from ENOWA’s owner, to create something of his own. That vision became JIMGU, where the ingredients are sourced from the Kyushu region, and much of the produce comes straight from JIMGU’s own farm, just minutes away from the resort.

Dinner began in JIMGU’s greenhouse, where we were welcomed with a short tour of the herbs and vegetables that would feature in the meal. It was a relaxed and intimate setting, and we were offered vegetable snacks and an apéritif among the greenery. This was a lovely and immersive start to the meal. From there, we were led to the main dining room, a modern yet warm space that mirrors the restaurant’s commitment to seasonality and simplicity. My dinner consisted of nine courses (menu included in photos), with freshly baked bread on the side and mignardises with coffee/tea to end.

This was a highly enjoyable meal. While the cooking techniques on display were not complicated, they were well execution. Several proteins were featured throughout the evening, but it was the vegetables that truly, and expectedly, stole the show. Each dish was fresh, vibrant, and plated with colour and creativity. Some of the standout dishes for me included:

* Asparagus with almond sauce – earthy, tender, and beautifully balanced.
* Beetroot dish – I’m usually not a fan of beetroot, but this one completely won me over. Goes very well with the bread.
* The Signature Bouquet dish (First pictured) – This is first presented tableside as a bouquet of flowers before being taken to the kitchen and transformed into a plate that looked like post-modern art. It reminded me of L’Effervescence’s iconic salad. I scraped the plate clean.
* Saddleback Pork from Kagoshima – Juicy and well-executed, paired perfectly with its supporting vegetables and sauce.

Dessert was no afterthought either. The carrot leaves dessert was unexpected and refreshing, showcasing his creativity.

The service throughout the meal was excellent. The staff are fully bilingual in English and Japanese, and each course came with thoughtful explanations that helped us appreciate the ingredients, techniques, and inspirations behind the dishes. It really added to the experience. 

Staying guest at ENOWA would be served both dinner and breakfast. The next morning, we had a delicious seasonal breakfast at JIMGU (photos and menu also shared). For breakfast, the highlight was the turnip soup, the omelet (featuring organic eggs from their nearby chicken farm) and the banana crepe. Before check-out, we were pleasantly surprised to be offered a personal tour of the JIMGU farm led by Tashi himself.

The farm is just a 5-minute drive from the resort and is within walking distance of JR Yufuin Station. We walked through the fields as Tashi picked fresh herbs and vegetables for us to taste, sharing stories of his move from New York to Japan, the challenges of organic farming (dealing with pests without pesticides), and his long-term vision, which includes growing their organic chicken farm and expanding his crop variety (he hopes to grow more nut plants in the coming seasons).

What amazed me even more was learning that Tashi also serves as general manager of ENOWA (well its a small hotel after all). To spend three years building a farm from the ground up (with no guarantee that the farm could succeed) before opening the restaurant, and then to run both the restaurant and the resort, such dedication is rare and deeply inspiring. By the end of the tour, I had an even deeper appreciation for the meals we’d had. It was clear just how much thought, labor, and love had gone into every single bite.

If you’re planning a trip to Yufuin, JIMGU is a must-visit. It is highly seasonal and your menu would really depend on the harvest that week (or even that day). While you do not need to stay at ENOWA and can book dinner separately via Omakase, staying overnight gives you the full experience such as access to the morning farm tour, which adds so much more context and richness to the dining experience.

As a side note, ENOWA is absolutely stunning. The rooms and villas are sleek, minimalist, and beautifully appointed with private onsen baths in every room, nestled within greenery. It’s calm, quiet luxury done right. In 2024, ENOWA was awarded two Michelin Keys, so you can be assured of a great stay here.

When I asked Tashi what his favorite season to cook is, he said winter without hestitation. Winter vegetables are his favourite to work with. It looks like I will have to visit JIMGU during winter seaason in the future.

**Score**: 4.5 / 5

**Reservation Difficulty**: Easy via Omakase, but instead of just having dinner, staying at ENOWA for dinner and breakfast, with farm tour, is highly recommended.

**Cost**: ¥27,500 for dinner (before service charge, as listed on Omakase).",7,1749656213.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

Not long ago, just waking up in the morning felt impossible. These days, looking into his warm brown eyes was reason enough. 

The sun had just begun to warm the hardwood. It was almost ten. I handed him a coffee.

I think he could tell I was anxious. I couldn’t sleep, and it showed.  He made a corny joke about staying strong:  ""it's Saturday. Monday to Friday are the weak-days.” I laughed and wished I could freeze that moment, live in it forever.

He left with Daisy trotting at his side, leash loose in his hand. As soon as the door closed, the dread sank in. I took my time tidying up- avoiding the day and counting the hours until I'd feel at home in his gaze again.

I considered cancelling but knew I couldn't put it off any longer. I dragged myself across town to meet my sister.



“You seem... good,” she said, eyes searching me like she was looking for the loose thread that could unravel my façade.

I nodded. “I am.”

“I wish you’d answer my calls.” She gripped her coffee cup tightly. “I worry. When things got bad, well… before... you’re doing everything right now... right?”

I stirred my tea slowly. Nodded.

She clenched her jaw before continuing, “I trust you- I do, I swear. Just after everything with Parker-” My eyes snapped up. “I just need to know you’re being careful. You’re following Dr. Shivani’s advice? No relationships?”

I pictured Leo. His eyes crinkling in a smile. “No relationships,” I echoed.

She offered to pay the bill. I didn’t argue.



On my way home, a familiar form caught my eye- Leo and Daisy, crossing the street. 

My stress slipped away as I headed toward them. I was about to call out when they turned up the steps of a house. A woman opened the door. He went in.

I froze. Told myself it could be anything. A cousin. A dog trainer. A friend.

It had to be nothing.

But I couldn’t settle. The afternoon went by in a blur. 

He’d come home with a simple explanation, we’d laugh this off. And if he didn’t, I was prepared this time. Not like with Parker.

When he finally walked in, he stopped cold. His eyes widened. Daisy barked.

“Hi,” I said softly.

He didn’t speak.

“It’s okay. You probably didn’t expect me. I just needed to talk.”

He blinked, searching my face. “Jesus... Julie? From The Daily Grind?”

I nodded. “You said you liked how I remembered your order.”

He stepped back, hand going to his phone instinctively. “How do you know where I live?.. Did you break into my house?”

Why was he angry? I was the one with questions.

I held firm to the handle of the knife.  
I smiled, willing myself not to cry.

[While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply disturbed in his spirit to see that the city was full of idols. — Acts 17:16 ](https://preview.redd.it/hryo5upxdb6f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=369d2e0e4b7aba53f8e7bf086584e64eaf11fc24)

**A believer in God** can't look at how the world treats sacred things without feeling deep pain.

Athens was a city full of idols—there were said to be more gods than people. It wasn't easy to confess Christ in Athens, surrounded by visible displays of idolatry everywhere. Yet, that was exactly where the true God needed to be proclaimed, and Paul was God's only witness there.

It's not enough to speak for God only where His name is respected, where most people are already friendly to Him. If we do that and then shy away from speaking His name where people are hostile, we've failed in our loyalty.

In Athens, Paul spoke words the people had never heard before. He proclaimed the one true God in a place where hundreds of gods were worshipped. He declared God as spiritual and unseen, while the people worshipped physical statues.",1,1749656136.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

|**Model**|**Price**|**CPU**|**GPU**|**RAM**|**Storage**|**Weight**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MSI Titan 18 HX|$5,300|Core Ultra 9 285HX|RTX 5080|32GB|2TB SSD|8.8 lbs|
|ASUS ROG Strix Scar 16|$3,300|Core Ultra 9 275HX|RTX 5080|32GB|1TB SSD|5.5 lbs|
|HP Omen 16|$1,200|Core i7-14700HX|RTX 4060|16GB|512GB SSD|5.1 lbs|

**Gaming performance results**

**1440p gaming (max settings)**

Cyberpunk 2077 + Ray Tracing:

* MSI Titan: 95 FPS
* ASUS Strix: 89 FPS
* HP Omen: 48 FPS

CS2 (Competitive):

* MSI Titan: 380 FPS
* ASUS Strix: 365 FPS
* HP Omen: 280 FPS

Baldur's Gate 3 (Ultra):

* MSI Titan: 82 FPS
* ASUS Strix: 78 FPS
* HP Omen: 38 FPS

For esports games, all three are overkill.  
For AAA games at 1440p, the HP struggles but is still playable.

**Real-world usage discoveries**

**Heat and noise under load**

* MSI Titan gets HOT (85°C), sounds like a jet engine (56 dB).
* ASUS Strix is warm but manageable (78°C), with moderate noise (48 dB).
* HP Omen is the coolest (72°C), and surprisingly quiet (44 dB).

**Battery life (web browsing and office work)**

* MSI Titan lasts 2.8 hours and needs a massive power brick.
* ASUS Strix gives 4.2 hours but still needs to stay near outlets.
* HP Omen lasts 7.5 hours and is actually portable.

**Portability reality check**

* MSI Titan doesn't fit normal backpacks, TSA nightmare, lap use burns.
* ASUS Strix fits gaming bags and works for occasional travel.
* HP Omen actually works as a laptop and is comfortable on lap.

**What surprised me most**

**Performance per dollar** When you break it down by FPS per dollar:

* HP Omen: Best value by far
* ASUS Strix: Solid premium value
* MSI Titan: Terrible value unless you're using every watt

**Thermal throttling reality**

* All three thermal throttle under sustained load.
* Even the $5,300 MSI slows down when hot.
* The HP starts lower but stays more consistent.

**Daily use winners**

* Coffee shop work: Only HP doesn't get weird looks.
* College dorm: HP won't annoy roommates.
* Content creation: MSI wins for 4K editing, others struggle.
* Competitive gaming: All hit 300+ FPS, performance difference irrelevant.

**Who should buy what**

**MSI Titan 18 HX ($5,300)** Buy if you:

* Are a professional content creator doing 4K editing
* Are a hardcore enthusiast chasing ultimate specs
* Genuinely have no budget limit

Skip if you:

* Mostly play competitive titles (it's overkill)
* Need portability
* Have a budget under $4,000

**ASUS ROG Strix Scar 16 ($3,300)** Buy if you:

* Want a premium gaming and streaming experience
* Do occasional content creation
* Can afford without stress

Skip if you:

* Only play esports
* Travel frequently
* Need max value per dollar

**HP Omen 16 ($1,200)** Buy if you:

* Are a student or budget-conscious gamer
* Play mixed genres at 1080p to 1440p
* Want real laptop functionality
* Are buying your first gaming laptop

Skip if you:

* Demand 4K gaming
* Do professional editing
* Want luxury build materials

**Controversial take** The RTX 5080 laptops aren't worth the massive premium.  
For 95% of users, the performance difference doesn't justify the 3x price tag.  
We've hit serious diminishing returns on ultra-premium gaming laptops, especially with ongoing driver issues.

**Final verdict** If I had to buy with my own money: **HP Omen 16**.  
It plays everything I actually game at happy settings, costs less than a car payment, and functions like a real laptop.

The MSI is impressive but impractical.  
The ASUS is great if you have money to burn.

Ask me anything about specific games, benchmarks, or usage scenarios.

Personally, I was mostly blind to it. I knew I had a very ""feast or famine"" approach to my hobbies and interests. In the sense that I would find something new, obsessively learn about it and immerse myself in it, then drop it like I never cared about it a few months later.

I also have always been so, so tired. All my life I thought this was just how people went about their lives. I'd drink so much coffee and energy drinks throughout the day to feel even half alive.

My forgetfulness, my attentiveness, all of it was terrible. If something captured my attention, I became instantly insulated to every other stimuli around me, including people talking to me.

My whole life I could feel myself mentally going to Narnia any time someone started talking to me. I'd lose the plot almost instantly and, honestly, that was so distressing. I don't want people to think, especially people I care about deeply, that I don't give a shit about what they have to say. I legitimately just couldn't focus for long on their words.

I started low dose Ritalin after a clinician asked me some questions. No intense battery of questions, no psychological tests, no repeat visits, just felt I met enough criteria to try out medicine immediately and it has changed everything.

Things in ways I didn't expect.

My agitation and stress seems dramatically lower. Big groups and stores, especially, would drive my heart rate and agitation through the roof. On medication, that doesn't happen anymore.

And sleep, my god, SLEEP, I actually rest! No more getting up in the middle of the night constantly, no more mind racing at bed, I just go to sleep!

And, of course, I can actually focus now. I feel productive and I have a single cup of coffee to carry me through the entire day.

My immediate feeling is almost grief. I'm in my 30s. Is this how I was supposed to feel all my life?",3,1749655887.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

You’re wrapping up a PR with important bugfixes. “It’s only 2pm and I’m almost done! This is going to be a great day!” You commit, push and go grab a celebratory coffee, because you the build will take at least a half an hour.

You check your PR around 3pm, the pipelines didn’t pass! You forgot to update one test id! Back, to the keyboard. “It’s fine, it’s still early!” Commit, push, refresh PR page. “The pipeline is busy, your PR is in the queue”. You get annoyed, but there’s nothing you can do, so you move on to another task.

Or, you want to move on, but it’s Friday 4pm, a perfect moment for your PM to ask about that important bugfix that you promised during the daily that you’ll have ready today. “It’s stuck in the pipeline” - you try to get rid of the PM. Unfortunately, “stuck” is their trigger word.

The PM opens a group chat between you, them, the team leader and the DevOps engineer. “The pipeline is stuck on this important bugfix! We need help!” - the PM also wants to leave work soon. They’re thinking lighting a fire under everyone is a great way to move things along. After another 45 minutes of explaining what is going on, analyzing how pipelines work, how important in reality is this bugfix and how many risks it may contain - the team leader and the DevOps decide to manually skip the pipeline for this PR.

“We’re unblocked” - the PM couldn’t be happier. The PR is merged, the app is published on Friday night - because apparently this story is straight from hell - and then the app crashes due to a JS bug that the pipelines would have caught 🤷

Prompt one : “Love thy neighbour.”

Edward is a 33-year-old man living in a quiet, middle-class suburban neighborhood. His life appears, on the surface, to be rather ordinary. He works as an IT technician—a job that provides stability, but little satisfaction. His personal life has been a series of quiet disappointments.

A year ago, he went through a devastating breakup with his wife. Their marriage had barely lasted a few weeks before she discovered his secret—his homosexuality. She tore apart his character, denouncing him to their mutual friends in the church community they had once been a part of. The slander was swift and brutal. Edward found himself cast out—not just from his marriage, but from the very social network that had once been his anchor.

One of the few constants in Edward’s life now is his neighbor, Roy, who has quietly become a close friend. Roy lives next door in a house that’s a stark contrast to Edward's modest home. The house, with its three floors, basement, and—oddly—its wine cellar, seems almost out of place in this suburban neighborhood. Roy, tall at 6'4"", often towers over Edward, who stands at 5'9.

Every Saturday and Sunday evening, the two of them find themselves on Roy’s front porch, drinks in hand. It was a warm afternoon when Edward—Eddy, as Roy called him—found himself in the garden again. Trimming dead stems, watering the soil, and watching as the flowers bloomed every spring.

For a moment, he caught a strange, faint odor. He took in a deep breath, trying to pinpoint the source. At first, he thought it was the compost pile near the fence, but that didn’t quite explain it. The smell wasn’t like rotting vegetables; it was heavier, more organic.

He considered Roy’s house next door. Maybe Roy had been hunting again and had left some animal remains out to decompose? The day wore on, and the mild scent lingered. The windows were dark, and Roy had been quiet all day. There were no signs of movement, no headlights in the driveway, nothing to suggest Roy was home.

Edward’s feet itched to investigate, but he hesitated. What was he supposed to do? Knock on the door and ask if Roy had left a dead animal out for too long? He took a step toward the fence, and then stopped.

The next day, a Saturday afternoon. The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood. Roy appeared at the end of the driveway, walking toward Edward’s. His broad shoulders pulling at the sleeves of his T-shirt. His hair.

“Eddy!” Roy’s voice was warm and boisterous, like they hadn’t spoken in months, not just a few days. “Look at this! The garden’s looking fantastic. These roses, man.”

Edward smiled. “Thanks, Roy. It’s just a lot of patience, I guess.” He straightened up from his crouch, brushing off his knees as he dusted his hands on his jeans.

Roy’s grin widened. Roy’s smile curled into a more knowing, almost self-satisfied grin. “Well, I’ve got a bottle of 2015 Château Lafite Rothschild down in the cellar. You ever had that?”

“2015 Château Lafite Rothschild?” Edward repeated, trying to keep the tone casual. “That sounds pretty fancy.”

Roy’s eyes lit up. Edward felt a flicker of discomfort. Just a pinch of discomfort.

Edward wasn’t exactly a wine connoisseur, but even he knew that Château Lafite Rothschild wasn’t just something anyone could casually open up on a Saturday night.

“I mean, sure, sounds great,” Edward said, trying to sound as casual as possible. “If you’re offering, I’ll take you up on it.”

Roy clapped him on the back with a little more force than necessary, his eyes lingering for just a moment too long before he stepped back. Edward smiled awkwardly, watching as Roy walked back toward his house.

Eddy looked back down at his garden, the roses now seeming somehow less beautiful, less peaceful, than they had before.

Later that evening, Edward stepped inside, the familiar scent of Roy’s home—wood and leather. Edward took the glass, swirling it for a moment before taking a sip. The taste was exquisite.

“So, how’s work been?” Roy asked, casually settling into an armchair across from him.

“Same as it’s always been,” Edward said, smiling softly. Edward added, “I noticed something... Is the plumbing in your house okay? I mean, I’ve been smelling something... a little off? Could be coming from the pipes or something.”

Roy’s smile didn’t falter. He leaned back in his chair, looking almost amused.

“Rot?” Roy repeated. “We’ve had a bit of moisture in the basement recently—pipes can get a little musty down there...”

Edward nodded.

As the night went on, the taste of the wine started to lose its charm, and a faint dizziness crept up his spine. Roy, still watching him, leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees.

“How’s that wine treating you, Eddy? Feeling good?”

Edward wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. “Roy... I think I need to—”

But before Edward could finish his sentence, the room seemed to sway again.

Roy didn’t say anything at first. He simply leaned back in his chair, his smile widening just slightly, as though he were savoring something.

“Take it easy, Eddy,” Roy said, his voice low and almost... soothing?

The words echoed in Edward’s head like a warning, but he couldn’t focus enough to make sense of them. His limbs felt heavy, his head too light.

Slowly, with the faintest flicker of dread, he realized something was terribly wrong.

Edward tried to push himself to his feet, but his body felt unresponsive. He reached out, fumbling for the edge of the coffee table to steady himself, but it seemed to drift just out of reach.

Edward’s breath hitched in his chest.

I was sitting on my porch sipping coffee this morning and thought…

There are an infinite amount of people who cannot and will not exist.

During this same time, there has been increasing publicity about the adverse long-term effects on health of the caffeine in coffee. Therefore, the decrease in coffee consumption must have been caused by consumers' awareness of the harmful effects of caffeine.  
  
Which of the following, if true, most seriously calls into question the explanation above?  
  
(A) On average, people consume 30 percent less coffee today than they did 10 years ago.  
  
(B) Heavy coffee drinkers may have mild withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, for a day or so after significantly decreasing their coffee consumption.  
  
(C) Sales of specialty types of coffee have held steady as sales of regular brands have declined.  
  
(D) The consumption of fruit juices and caffeine-free herbal teas has increased over the past decade.  
  
(E) Coffee prices increased steadily in the past decade because of unusually severe frosts in coffee-growing nations.­

\--

The answer is E but I chose C because if the specialty coffee sales have been steady then that means that the bad publicity of coffee having adverse long term effects doesn't matter because consumers are still choosing to drink coffee, right? I think C just proves that consumers are changing their preferences on the type of coffee but still choosing to drink coffee and therefore weakens the link between consumers knowing the harmful effects --> decrease in coffee consumption but it's wrong and I don't really understand why",1,1749655410.0,GMAT,2,1.0,False

I am so tired. I keep having more and more migraines. Now I got to the point where I feel like I can't do anything without causing myself one.  

I started having migraines 15 years ago, but back then I only had one or two a month around my period. It was like that for a couple of years.     
Then I had kids and time went by and for a while it increased to 4-5 a month, it was still manageable. But now ? Now I have between 15 and 20 migraines a month. It feels like I can't do anything anymore. And everyday in between I am either in prodrome or postdrome so I am constantly dizzy, weak and foggy and my neck, shoulders and back hurt.      
I also have fibromyalgia.  
I'm sick of preventing myself to live fully. It's not fair.    

I want to play with my kids and take them up in my arms.   
I want to eat everything I want without being scared of causing myself a migraine.  
I want to wear my hair like I want to, up or down, without hurting myself.  
I want to wear sunglasses.  
I want to be able to go out in the sun on a hot day.  
I want to train and do sports like I was before. Run, bike, swim, jump on a trampoline, go on long walks outside.      
I want to dance, do yoga, lift my arms up over my head, bend down, jump and go on a swing.   
I want to drink an occasional, once in a year alcoholic drink at a Christmas party with my family.  
I want to be able to draw whenever I want to, without hurting my arms and neck and risking a migraine.    
I want to be able to play videogames whenever I want to, without risking a migraine.     
I want to be able to wear a bra everyday without hurting my body and risking a migraine.   
I want to wear all the clothes I want to.  
I want to clean my house and repair things in it without risking a migraine.  
I want to be able to plan something in advance.   
I want to be able to go to work somewhere I want to and being reliable on my work days.  
I want to be able to cry when I feel like it.   
I want to take care of my kids and their dad everyday without having fucking migraines days to prevent me to do so.  
 
It's so exhausting. I'm sick of migraines.   
  
I'm sorry for the long vent.   

I am trying everything I can and nothing seems to work.   

So far, I tried :  

Preventives :  
- Amitriptyline 
- Candesartan  
- Propranolol  
- Lyrica  
- Effexor (little dose for migraine prevention)  
- Nurtec  

Abortives :  
- Almotriptan  
- Sumatriptan  
- Rizatriptan  
- Nurtec   

And for the hormonal migraines I also tried a bunch of things :  
- Alesse (before I was diagnosed with migraines and aura)
- Yasmin (before I was diagnosed with migraines and aura)  
- Micronor
- Mirena 
- Slynd   

I don't take any contraception anymore because they all cause me more migraines.    

I am now on Nurtec and Rizatriptan.  
I take Nurtec mostly as an abortive but I am prescribed 15 a month so I can take one every two days and I can take Rizatriptan if the Nurtec didn't work.  

I also take daily :  
- Magnesium   
- Riboflavin (B2)  
- Vitamin D  
- Coq10  
- Omega 3    

I see a physical therapist every month and do the exercises everytime I am able to do so. I  walk everyday that I don't have a migraine to try and do exercices everyday. I cut off coffee 2 years ago, I avoid fake sugar, monosodic glutamate, Hydrolyzed Protein, Maltodextrin, nuts, chocolate, alcohol and old cheese. I drink more than enough everyday, including electrolytes beverages (I mix natural coconut water with a little bit of bodyarmor for the taste). I eat mostly healthy and various meals.   
I am really careful with medication overuse headaches. I am aware of the risks of causing that with Triptan, ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  

I am waiting for a neurologist appointment to try Aimovig, Ajovy or Emgality.  

And I also went to an eye exam again, I don't need prescription glasses. I also go to the dentist every year.     
I don't smoke. I try to sleep the most stable way possible with 4 kids.  
I also see an ENT every 6 months for my ears and dizziness.  
Oh and over the years I saw maybe 4 or 5 different osteopath.  

Sorry for my vent. I thought maybe some people would understand me here. Nobody around me in real life has migraines.  

I am sick of all this. I want to live.

It wasn’t because we fought. It wasn’t because something bad happened. But somehow, sadness found its way into our home — quiet, heavy, and unnamed.

We — husband and wife — woke up in silence. Not out of anger, but because we were both carrying too many thoughts. Life lately has been exhausting. The weight of responsibilities, unspoken worries, and quiet disappointments pressed on us more than usual.

He still made me coffee, but didn’t say a word. I still prepared breakfast, but didn’t smile. We looked at each other, but it felt like we were looking through each other.

There were moments I wanted to cry, but I held it in. Because I knew — he was sad too. The kind of sadness that comes from trying to be strong for too long. And me — the one who always pretends to be okay — I just felt small today.

The house was filled with the clinking of dishes, the distant laughter of our child, and the quiet ache of two adults trying to hold it together.

We didn’t talk much, but I still sat beside him while he watched TV. He still pulled the blanket over me when I dozed off on the couch. And I knew — love was still there. Just hidden under the weight of a long, hard day.

It was a sad day… but not a lonely one.

A sad day… but a reminder that we still have each other. That even in silence, we care. Even when we’re tired, we’re still trying.

Maybe tomorrow will be better. Sometimes all it takes is a gentle touch, a simple question like “Are you okay?” or “Let’s hold on a little longer, together.”",1,1749655152.0,u_Electrical_Fly_4733,0,1.0,False

Interview was a Stokes interview which surprised me.

10 mins on my background. 10 mins of the generic questions about “are you here legally?” “Have you committed a crime?”. Then 40 mins of relationship questions. How we met, what she does for a job, how much is our mortgage, car rental payments, what her parents are called and what they do for work, where was our wedding, why did we pick that location, how she takes her coffee, what are our plans this weekend etc etc 

My wife (US citizen) was in for around 15 mins and the interviewer checked like half of the answers matched and then gave approval to my wife and came out to get me and gave us verbal approval together.

In case you missed my last post, I created a form with important dating questions for lesbians to fill out. I am manually matching lesbians based on their answers then messaging them through reddit, insta, email, (however you may want to be contacted) to let them know of each other. If you are a single lesbian looking for a partner, I've shared the form link in my profile. Feel free to fill it out and join the fun! If you're having trouble finding the link, send me a DM

For the record, I will not be sharing anyone's responses. I am simply selecting one person and finding the best match to your answers, then I will message each of you privately. The only personal information I ask for is a method of contact (reddit, email, insta). If you are shy about sharing any of those options, you can make up a gmail account today, it is strictly being used as a method to contact each other.

Some people have suggested that I charge for this service, but I'm really exhausted by everything in this world being driven by monetary value. I put my ""buy me a coffee"" at the end of the survey if you feel generous, but I truly just want people to have fun and encourage lesbians to find romance (or at least friendship) and do not want anyone to feel obligated to pay. 

With all the lesbian/bisexual controversy going on, I think we just need a method to find each other and have fun. Share this with any lesbians you know, even outside of reddit.

1l8vc9c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8vc9c,I genuinely had so much fun in Seoul,"Honestly, Korea wasn’t even high on my list. I booked five nights in Seoul kind of randomly, didn’t expect much, and assumed I might get bored halfway through.Totally wrong. Seoul was way more fun than I thought it’d be, and five days felt way too short. Already thinking about round two, I don’t think great trips come from ticking off big sights. Sometimes it just clicks because the city fits your vibe. That’s what happened here

If you’re into shopping, this place is wild

Where I live, physical stores are kinda sad. But in Seoul, I actually wanted to spend time browsing. Whether it’s local designer stuff, cheaper fashion, or just super aesthetic multi-brand stores, it’s all there and it’s fun. Prices weren’t bad eitherI used an app called Yuanzhou Travel to save the shops I wanted to hit. The AI helped map out the best route based on what I felt like doing that day. Sounds like overkill but it saved me from a lot of walking in circles

If you’re into that urban energy, Seoul’s got it

Walking around felt like being in one of those slice-of-life Korean dramas. You know that feeling when you grab a bag of coffee from a convenience store at night and there’s music playing from somewhere and people are just out living? That was the vibe

I found myself in Hongdae surrounded by students dancing and couples eating late-night snacks, and I kept thinking wow, this is the stuff people romanticize for a reason

If you love design and cute things, good luck.

I went into a store called Object just to look, and came out with stationery, a weird motivational poster, and three notebooks I definitely don’t need. Korean aesthetics are too good

I used an app called Kulikuli to read some of the handwritten signs. It worked surprisingly well and the translations made me laugh , super dry, kinda philosophical in a way only Korean product copy can be

Seoul isn’t all about major sights, and that’s what makes it great.

My favorite moments weren’t in palaces or museums. I just liked sitting by Cheonggyecheon Stream at night, surrounded by people doing their own thing. One night I grabbed convenience store ramen and ate it by the Han River. There were couples picnicking with delivery chicken, groups chatting with beer and instant noodles. Zero pressure to do anything , it just felt like life was happening around me

Also yes, I did the thing where I packed an empty suitcase and filled it with Olive Young stuff.

Shampoo, skincare, toothpaste, makeup, all of it. It’s honestly so much more fun in-store than buying online. Plus you get to test everything and claim the instant tax refund on the spot. No regrets.

A few random tips if you’re going:

eSIM

I got one from Redteago before flying out. $10 for 10GB and the sale runs through the end of June. Set it up at home and I was online the second I landed. Worked the whole time without any drops.

Where I stayed

92 Mapo-daero, Mapo-gu. My room had a queen bed and way more space than I expected. Subway entrance was right outside, which made a huge difference. I barely used taxis. Gongdeok Station is connected to the airport express too, so getting to Incheon or Gimpo was easy.

There’s a 7-Eleven in the building and good coffee and Olive Young nearby, so you don’t need to wander far for food or essentials.

Getting around

Grab a Tmoney card from a convenience store. You can reload it or get a refund when you leave.

For subways, the “Korean Subway” app is super simple and does the job.

Google Maps is fine for names and general location, but for directions and timing, Naver Map or KakaoMap is way more accurate.

One small thing

Korea uses round two-prong plugs. Bring the right adapter or you’ll end up begging the hotel front desk",81,1749655014.0,koreatravel,4,1.0,False

# High Guard Sound, EP 4

INT- BOARDROOM THREE, MIDDAY

FILLING ONE WALL IS A  WINDOW. A LARGE TABLE HAS CANS OF ENERGY DRINKS, A FEW BOTTLES OF JUICE, A SMALL PLATES OF SANDWICHES, MUFFINS, PRE-CUT FRUIT, AND A COUPLE OF BAGELS. THE PLATES ARE PARTIALLY EATEN. ONE WALL HAS A LARGE TV SCREEN.

THE GIRLS ARE SITTING AROUND THE TABLE. ROSEMARY AND AMARYLLIS ARE SITTING FACING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. SAGE IS READING SHEET MUSIC AND MAKING NOTES. PARSLEY IS LIGHTLY DRUMMING ON THE TABLE. THYME IS STANDING STARING OUT THE WINDOW. SNAPDRAGON IS TRYING NOT TO STARE AT SAGE. CARAWAY AND DRETCH WALK IN.

DRETCH

Ahh, good you’re all here.

CARAWAY HANDS OUT FOLDERS TO EVERYONE. HE, DRETCH, AND THYME SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE.

CARAWAY

The bureaucratic stuff is on top. Permission forms and such for maintaining your places. Fairly standard tour contracts. Next we have the schedule, forty-eight stops over four months. There are several media stops in that list as well.

EVERYONE LOOKS THOUGH THE LIST.

SAGE

Looks like we hitting near where my aunts live. Can we send them a couple of tickets?

CARAWAY

Yes, should be no problem. Let me know where to send them.

ROSEMARY

You got us North By North East?

DRETCH

Yes. You’re not on the main stage.

PARSLEY

Yet.

ROSEMARY

Hey, THYME your father’s near Vancouver, isn’t he? We could send him a ticket.

THYME

Yes… and we’ll see.

AMARYLLIS

This media event before NXNE…

DRETCH

Just a meet-and-greet and a quick best hits. No media, but not a lock-down.

ROSEMARY AND SNAPDRAGON LOOK AT AMARYLLIS. ROSEMARY LOOKS CONFUSED, AND SNAPDRAGON LOOKS CONCERNED.

CARAWAY

Next in the stack is the press kit. Run through it and let us know if we need to change anything. Last, it the set lists. There’s a fair bit of flexibility here, but the total does need to be about eighty minutes.

SNAPDRAGON

“Yo Ho” is a good one for audience participation, that one always gets them going.

ROSEMARY

We’ve got a few like that. Robinia doesn’t like us cranking the crowd up too much. Though… aren’t a few of these outdoor stops?

DRETCH

Yes.

PARSLEY

We don’t need to keep the set list completely the same?

CARAWAY

The more consistent the better… What are you thinking of?

PARSLEY

In the outdoor venues you can really crank up the crowds without causing the same problems that you have in an indoor one. Though it does depend on the crowd.

THYME

We are not starting a riot.

CARAWAY

Always a good idea. We have two test shows at The  Lyngarth in two months to make sure everything works.

CARAWAY LOOKS AT AMARYLLIS AND ROSEMARY.

CARAWAY (CONT’D)

As for you two. We have an idea to help you work through figuring out whose the best.

ROSEMARY

What did you have in mind?

A MID SIZED ROOM. SOME MUSIC STANDS ARE COLLECTED IN ONE CORNER. ROSEMARY AND AMARYLLIS ARE TUNING UP THEIR GUITARS.

AMARYLLIS

Ugh. I can’t believe we have to do this.

ROSEMARY

I agree. This had better be worth it.

ROSEMARY TAKES MOUTHFUL OUT A CAN OF ENERGY DRINK.

AMARYLLIS

New flavour? Any good?

ROSEMARY SHRUGS.

ROSEMARY

Not bad either. Still prefer white pineapple though.

AMARYLLIS

Orange creamsicle myself. Let’s do this.

ROSEMARY PLAYS THE OPENING TO “DUELING BANJOS”. AMARYLLIS PLAYS THE OPENING ROCKED UP A BIT. ROSEMARY PLAYS AN EVEN HARDER ROCK VERSION. AMARYLLIS RESPONDS WITH A STRONG POWER CHORD.

FADE OUT

 

INT – HALLWAY

THE HALLWAY IS STANDARD OFFICE BEIGE. THERE ARE PICTURES  OCCASIONALLY ON THE WALLS BOTH OF LANDSCAPES AND VARIOUS MUSICAL GROUPS.

ROSEMARY AND AMARYLLIS ARE WALKING DOWN THE HALL. THEY ARE ARGUING ABOUT A SERIES OF DETAILS OF “ANYTHING YOU CAN DO (I CAN DO BETTER)”. THEY WALK BY SLIMEBOY AND PARNELLE CARRYING MILK CRATES OF PATCH CABLES.

SLIMEBOY

So how long do you think those two have been married?

PARNELLE

Married? I didn’t think they played for the same team.

SLIMEBOY

So, who do you think they’ll get to roadie for their tour?

PARNELLE

Don’t know. But, who ever it is, is in for a long one if those two can’t begin to figure things out.

THERE IS SCATTERED LAUGHTER. THE AUDIO TECHNICIAN HOLDS HIS THUMB UP. SLIMEBOY STEPS BACK FROM THE MIC. HE PLACES THE OTHER MICS ON THE STAGE. PHLOX IS UNSPOOLING A CABLE AS HE WALKS OFF STAGE. PARNELLE WAVES A UV FLASHLIGHT OVER THE TAPE ON THE FLOOR. THE PIECES GLOW IN DIFFERENT COLOURS. PARNELLE AND SLIMEBOY HEAD OFF STAGE. THE STAGE LIGHTS TURN OFF BEHIND THEM.

PHLOX, SLIMEBOY, AND PARNELLE STAND-OFF STAGE.

PHLOX

Alright boys, now we stand and wait.

INT –DRESSING ROOM.

ALONG TWO WALLS ARE THREE MAKE-UP STATIONS. A DRESSING SCREEN AND CLOTHES RACK FILL THAT CORNER. A SMALL REFRIGERATOR AND A COFFEE MAKER ON TOP ARE AGAINST THE FOURTH WALL WITH THE DOOR.

AMARYLLIS AND SNAPDRAGON ARE GETTING READY.

SNAPDRAGON

Did you see the crowd? And it’s not close to start time yet?

AMARYLLIS

Yeah. It’s going to be a good show. We’re going to show that…

AMARYLLIS LOOKS AT SNAPDRAGON

AMARYLLIS (CONT’D)

Nervous?

SNAPDRAGON

A bit. This will probably be one of the biggest crowds we’ve ever done. And we’ll have bigger yet on tour. If we screw this up…

AMARYLLIS

Snap. I can use all the dicks in this room to count how many things can kill a show for us. And still have some left over.

SNAPDRAGON CHUCKLES.

AMARYLLIS (CONT’D)

You know your stuff. I know my stuff. And as much as it galls me to say it; Bubblegum and her crew know their stuff. We’re pretty much guaranteed a good show. It’ll be up to us to make it great. Alright?

SNAPDRAGON

Alright.

AMARYLLIS

Good. Now let’s show’em what we can do.

FADE OUT.

 

 

 

INT –DRESSING ROOM.

ALONG TWO WALLS ARE TWO MAKE-UP STATIONS. ALONG THE THIRD WALL IS A SHORT CHESTERFIELD. A DRESSING SCREEN AND CLOTHES RACK FILL THAT CORNER. A SMALL REFRIGERATOR AND A COFFEE MAKER ON TOP ARE AGAINST THE FOURTH WALL WITH THE DOOR.

SAGE, ROSEMARY, THYME, AND PARSLEY ARE GETTING READY.

PARSLEY

I’m glad Amaryllis and Snapdragon agreed to let us open this show. Makes it easier for my sibs to see our show, even if it isn’t a school night.

THYME

The herd is here? Robinia will be thrilled.

ROSEMARY

Oh, come on. They’re fun. And besides their energy will spread to the rest of the crowd.

THYME

That’s what I’m worried about.

PARSLEY

I’ve spoken to them. And my folks will have some backup.

SAGE

Who?

FADE OUT

 

INT – MEDIUM SIZED VENUE FLOOR

THERE ARE SEVERAL TABLES ON THE FLOOR. THE CROWD IS SLOWLY GROWING. SEVERAL SERVERS ARE WORKING THROUGH THE CROWD ON THE FLOOR TAKING ORDERS OR SERVING DRINKS.

AT A TABLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FLOOR ARE PARSLEY’S SIBLINGS, AND BEAR. THE YOUNGER ONES ARE SITTING STARING AT BEAR. BEAR OCCASIONALLY GLANCES AT THEM. HE IS SHIFTING AWKWARDLY WITH THE ATTENTION.

SIBLING ONE

Are you a giant?

BEAR

Umm… No.

SIBLING TWO

You sure? You’re huge like a giant.

BEAR

Yes.

SIBLING ONE

You talk deep like a giant.

BEAR

I’m not a giant.

SIBLING TWO

Your glass is huge like a giant’s.

BEAR

I’m not a giant. But…

BEAR GLANCES AROUND, AND THEN LEANS DOWN. HE SMILES CONSPIRATORIALY.

BEAR (CONT’D)

Sometimes I hang out with them. This is a drink that all giants enjoy. Would you like to try it?

THE SIBLINGS AROUND THE TABLE GO WIDE EYED, AND NOD ENTHUSIASTICALLY. BEAR STRAIGHTENS UP. HE CATCHES A BARTENDER’S EYE. HE POINTS AT HIS GLASS AND THEN GESTURES TO THE SIBLINGS AT THE TABLE. THE BARTENDER LOOKS AT ROBINIA. SHE LOOKS AT THE TABLE, THEN NODS. THE BARTENDER LOOKS BACK AT THE TABLE, THEN LAUGHS SILENTLY. A WAITRESS CARRIES OVER A TRAY WITH GLASSES FILLED WITH COLA. THE HEAD ON THEM HAS A RED TINGE.

WAITRESS

Sugar and the herd. Boss says, this one is yours to clean up.

BEAR LOOKS AT ROBINIA, THEN TO THE SIBLINGS WITH A LOOK OF CONCERN ON HIS FACE.

FADE OUT

 

INT – MEDIUM SIZED VENUE STAGE

SAGE, ROSEMARY, THYME, AND PARSLEY FINISH THEIR LAST SONG. THE CROWD IS CHEERING WILDLY.

ROSEMARY

Thank-you everyone. Remember this is our second last show here. So tell all your friends.

THEY ALL LEAVE THE STAGE. THE STAGE LIGHTS GO OUT. THE CROWD QUIETS DOWN SLIGHTLY.

A SINGLE SPOT LIGHT APPEARS ON AMARYLLIS. SHE IS ON STAGE RIGHT. SHE PLAYS THE OPENING TO “DUELING BANJOS”. A SECOND SPOTLIGHT APPEARS ON ROSEMARY. SHE IS ON STAGE LEFT. SHE PLAYS THE OPENING ROCKED UP A BIT. AMARYLLIS PLAYS AN EVEN HARDER ROCK VERSION. ROSEMARY RESPONDS WITH A STRONG POWER CHORD. ROSEMARY AND AMARYLLIS LAUNCH INTO A ROCK VERSION OF “ANYTHING YOU CAN DO (I CAN DO BETTER)” FROM “ANNIE GET YOUR GUN”. MULTIPLE GENRES OF ROCK AND GUITAR TECHNIQUES ARE COVERED. THIS REPRISE OF THE SONG WHILE STILL ANTAGONISTIC IS MORE POLISHED AND HAS FEWER DIGS AT EACH OTHER THAN THE FIRST VERSION.

THE CROWD GOES WILD AGAIN. ROSEMARY AND AMARYLLIS LOOK OUT. THERE IS A BIT OF CONCERN ON THEIR FACES.

ROSEMARY

I’m not sure if we have a problem or not.

AMARYLLIS

Yeah… you know what Caraway said about starting a riot…

ROSEMARY

Well, at least they are warmed up for you both. I’ll send Snapdragon out.

ROSEMARY WALKS OFF STAGE HOLDING FLOWERING THORN OVER HER HEAD, BY THE BALANCE, FACING THE CROWD. SNAPDRAGON WALKS ON STAGE. AMARYLLIS AND SNAPDRAGON LOOK AT EACH OTHER. THEY NOD. SNAPDRAGON PLAYS A SINGLE LONG NOTE FROM HER VIOLIN. AMARYLLIS PLAYS A SIMILAR NOTE FROM HER GUITAR. THEY START WITH THEIR FIRST SONG.

FADE OUT

 

INT – MEDIUM SIZED VENUE FLOOR

THERE ARE SEVERAL TABLES ON THE FLOOR. THE FLOOR AND TABLES ARE MOSTLY EMPTY. WAIT STAFF ARE CLEARING TABLES, AS THE LAST FEW PATRONS DRIFT TOWARDS THE DOOR. BEAR IS CARRYING OUT ONE SIBLING IN EACH ARM, AND ONE PIGGY BACK STYLE ON HIGH SHOULDERS. PARSLEY IS TALKING TO HER PARENTS.

CARAWAY AND DRETCH ARE SITTING AT ONE OF THE TABLES. ROBINIA WALKS OVER AND PLACES THREE BOTTLES AROUND ON THE TABLE. SHE TURNS A CHAIR AROUND AND SITS DOWN.

ROBINIA

Quite the show. The Muses save whatever venue you’re in when they hit their stride.

ROBININA, DRETCH, CARAWAY (TOGETHER)

The Muses.

THEY ALL RAISE THEIR BOTTLES AND TAKE A DRINK.

DRETCH

I know. I did not expect things to feed like that.

ROBINIA

No one ever does. A few of the cubs for the rags were here. They’ve got their story. But, they’ll feed the vines. Your tour will do well. Hope you’ve got enough kits, and space in your inboxes.

ROBINIA TAKES A DRINK FROM HER BOTTLE.

ROBINIA (CONT’D)

I’m not going to say have your crew dial it back a little. But, it would be nice if the crowd didn’t blow the place up tomorrow night.

ROBINIA LOOKS AROUND.

ROBINIA (CONT’D)

Though… it would be a chance to remodel the place a bit.

CARAWAY CHUCKLES.

CARAWAY

We’ll try and keep them in check.

PHLOX WALKS UP TO THE TABLE.

PHLOX

We’ve got everything prepped for tomorrow. So we’ll be --

ROBINIA

Hey, PHLOX you ol’ lugger. Still hanging with the Academy?

PHLOX

Yes. The young ones can always use a bit of an old hand even if it can’t keep up the same way.

ROBINIA

Yeah. I miss the road. But, this way I don’t hear the same tracks everyday.

ROBINIA STANDS UP AND FINISHES HER BOTTLE.

ROBINIA (CONT’D)

Anyways. Gotta go run the books. We’ll catch up a bit tomorrow?

PHLOX

Sure. You can help me and the lads bundle up.

ROBINIA WALKS TO THE BACK

PHLOX (CONT’D)

Looks like we’ve got the lightning bottled. Trick is, riding the thunder.

1l8v7i0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8v7i0,HIGHLY embellished story about my Jose just for fun. It was sold as a spiritus and it was a FB marketplace deal. Totally green that popped variation with the newest leaf. I think I am part of the underground plant network now however. Not complaining.,"# The Incredible Journey of Jose Bueno: A Case of Mistaken Plant Identity

*Or: How I Accidentally Became a Plant Detective and Discovered the World's Most Confident Philodendron*

## Chapter 1: The Great Deception

It started with a sketchy Facebook Marketplace post at 2 AM. ""RARE PHILODENDRON SPIRITUS SANCTI - $80 - CASH ONLY - SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY."" The photos were blurry, taken with what appeared to be a potato, and the seller's profile picture was just a close-up of a suspicious-looking houseplant.

Against my better judgment (and my friend's repeated warnings), I found myself in a dimly lit alley behind a gas station at 6 PM, clutching four crumpled twenties and questioning my life choices.

The seller emerged from the shadows like some sort of plant dealer straight out of a botanical noir film. Trench coat, dark sunglasses (at dusk, naturally), and a nervous twitch that made me wonder if he'd stolen this plant from someone's grandmother.

""You the plant person?"" he whispered, looking around like the Plant Police might bust us at any moment.

""This is the Spiritus Sancti?"" I asked, eyeing the somewhat sad-looking specimen in a cracked plastic pot.

""The rarest of the rare,"" he hissed, shoving the plant into my hands. ""Don't ask questions. Cash. Now.""

I should have known something was fishy when the ""transaction"" felt more like a drug deal than a plant purchase.

## Chapter 2: The Uncomfortable Truth

For weeks, I treated my ""Spiritus Sancti"" like botanical royalty. I whispered sweet nothings to it in Latin. I played it classical music. I even considered getting it its own Instagram account (@SpiritusSanctiSuperstar was already taken, apparently).

But something wasn't right. The leaves had this cheeky variation pattern that seemed almost... too confident? Too flashy? Like it was showing off at a plant party where everyone else brought boring pothos.

Then I gave it the full spa treatment - a humidifier that cost more than my rent, grow lights that could probably be seen from space, and the kind of care usually reserved for premature babies or sourdough starters.

That's when the truth revealed itself.

## Chapter 3: The Great Revelation

As the humidity worked its magic and the lights bathed my plant in photosynthetic glory, the leaves began to sing their true song. The variegation exploded like botanical fireworks. The patterns became so dramatic, so outrageously beautiful, that I had to put on sunglasses just to water it.

This wasn't a Spiritus Sancti at all.

This was Jose Bueno - the philodendron equivalent of a Latin dance instructor who just discovered glitter.

## Chapter 4: Coming Clean

I confronted my plant (yes, I talk to my plants, don't judge me).

""You're not who you said you were,"" I whispered accusingly.

If plants could shrug, Jose would have given me the most magnificent shoulder roll in houseplant history. Instead, it just unfurled another leaf so stunning it practically demanded its own spotlight and backup dancers.

## Chapter 5: The Glow-Up

Now, months later, Jose Bueno has fully embraced its true identity. It sits in my living room like a green celebrity who just got discovered at a coffee shop. The variegation is so intense, so perfectly Jose, that I'm pretty sure it's planning to start its own plant influencer career.

The fake Spiritus Sancti has become the most authentic Jose Bueno in the tri-state area. It's not just growing - it's *glowing*. Literally. I think the variegation might be bioluminescent at this point.

## Epilogue: Lessons from Jose

What did I learn from this botanical identity crisis?

1. Sometimes the best things in life come disguised as something else
2. A plant by any other name would photosynthesize just as sweet
3. Jose Bueno doesn't need to pretend to be rare to be spectacular
4. Never trust a plant vendor with a man-bun (kidding! ...mostly)
5. The right environment doesn't just help plants grow - it helps them become who they really are

Today, Jose Bueno sits proudly in its corner, practically radiating confidence. Sometimes I catch it flexing its variegated leaves like it's posing for a plant magazine cover. And honestly? It probably should be.

Because while I thought I was buying botanical royalty, what I actually got was something better: a plant with such spectacular identity that it turned a case of mistaken taxonomy into the greatest glow-up story of the houseplant world.

Jose Bueno: Not the plant I ordered, but definitely the plant I needed.

There are two programmable brew buttons, and the rinse button can also be used for manual continuous brewing. Everything relevant is shown on the display – brew time, programming mode, water tank status… and after brewing, the barista lights stay on for a few seconds, which just adds to the experience.

Trying to grow a blog can feel slow and uncertain, but treating it like a startup flips the script. Startups thrive on steady routines and habits that drive results every day. When you work with intention and treat your blog like a real business, growth isn’t just possible — it’s the natural outcome.

The right habits help you move fast, spot opportunities, and stay focused on what matters. By building a daily routine, you give yourself a structure that pushes your blog forward, even on days when motivation is low. This post covers the routines and habits that turn steady effort into lasting growth — just like any startup focused on results over hype.

# Laying the Foundation: Clarity of Purpose and Audience

Getting focused from the start gives your blog a clear edge. If you want to grow your blog like a startup, you need to know exactly what you stand for, who you want to reach, and how you’ll measure progress. Defining these key points lays your foundation and makes every daily habit more effective. Here’s how you can get this clarity for your blog.

# Crafting a Unique Value Proposition: Detail steps to identify what makes your blog stand out in your niche

Think of your blog’s value proposition as a quick answer to, “Why should anyone read this?” A strong value proposition tells readers what you offer that they won’t find anywhere else.

Follow these steps to make yours clear:

* Write your blog’s mission in one or two sentences. Focus on the core promise you make to readers. For help, check out this resource on [how to write a mission statement for your blog](https://coschedule.com/blog/mission-statement).
* List your main topics and pick the angle that sets you apart. Maybe it’s your voice, your background, your approach to a common topic, or your unique experience.
* Review competing blogs. Spot the gaps or see where you do things differently.
* Ask yourself what frustrates readers in your niche. Solve that problem better.
* Test your pitch with real readers, friends, or in relevant online communities. Did they “get it” quickly? If the answer is no, rewrite until your blog statement feels sharp and true to you.

When you do this well, you’ll waste less time second-guessing your direction.

# Building Reader Personas: Explain techniques for deeply understanding and targeting your primary audience

Knowing your audience is like having a secret growth map. When you build reader personas, you give every blog post a clear target. Your content becomes sharper and your growth accelerates.

Here’s how to build reader personas:

* Gather details about your best readers. Think about age, job, hobbies, goals, and problems.
* Dive into forums, Facebook groups, or Twitter chats related to your topic. Listen for real-life struggles and burning questions.
* Use surveys or polls to gather insights from your email list or followers.
* Describe your ideal reader like you’re painting a picture. Name them, list their habits, and write down their daily challenges.
* Map where they spend time online. This points you to the right guest posting and networking spots.
* Adjust your content and marketing to speak directly to this persona.

Some expert techniques can be found in this guide on [building effective reader personas](https://blog.lulu.com/reader-personas/).

When you’re stuck on what to write, just ask, “Would my ideal reader care about this?” It keeps your voice focused and your audience loyal.

# Setting SMART Metrics for Blog Success: Describe using Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (SMART) growth metrics

Telling yourself “I want my blog to grow” isn’t enough. Startup founders use clear, trackable goals, and so should you.

To set SMART goals, break down your blog plans using these five traits:

1. **Specific:** State exactly what you want (not just “get more views” — say “reach 10,000 monthly readers”).
2. **Measurable:** Pick metrics you can track (sessions, newsletter signups, comments, or earnings).
3. **Achievable:** Base targets on research and your schedule. Aim high but be realistic.
4. **Relevant:** Tie each goal to your bigger mission.
5. **Time-bound:** Set a deadline to create urgency.

Example: Instead of “I want more traffic,” use “I’ll publish two posts per week for the next three months to grow search traffic by 25%.” For more on writing and tracking goals, this resource on [how to write SMART goals](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals) is a handy reference.

Keep your top two or three goals on a sticky note near your workspace. Check your progress every week. Adjust your efforts, and you’ll get the feedback loop that powers real growth.

# Daily Routines for Content Creation

Content routines are the heartbeat of any blog aiming for growth. Every day, small habits and repeatable processes help you stay focused and productive, even when ideas stall or energy dips. When you treat blogging as a series of daily actions, not big creative bursts, you quickly build a content engine that churns out value for your audience. Below are actionable systems and habits that will keep your blog running like a well-oiled startup.

# Batching and Scheduling Content: Give practical advice on creating editorial calendars and batching tasks like writing, editing, and graphics

Batching tasks is like meal prepping for your blog — you get more done, feel less stressed, and make fewer mistakes. Start by creating an editorial calendar that maps out your topics, deadlines, and who’s responsible for each part. Planning just a week or two in advance helps you stay nimble but consistent.

Batch your work in focused blocks, such as:

* **Writing days**: Draft multiple posts while you’re in a creative flow.
* **Editing sessions**: Review and polish drafts in one sitting for efficiency and consistency.
* **Graphics creation**: Design images or source visuals for several posts at once, instead of scrambling last-minute.
* **Scheduling in blocks**: Use tools like Buffer or WordPress scheduling to plan out content distributions ahead of time.

Check out guides like [How To Batch Content For Your Blog](https://thecreativeimpact.com/batchcontent/) for step-by-step advice, or explore templates and more tips at [Batch Content Like a Pro](https://blog.fableheartmedia.com/batch-content-like-a-marketing-pro).

# Fast Idea Capture and Validation: Describe methods for capturing and validating blog ideas quickly, including tools and feedback loops

The best blog ideas can pop up anywhere — on a walk, during a podcast, or in a comment thread. The trick is to capture them instantly, before they slip away.

Easy idea capture methods include:

* **Voice memos on your phone**
* **Quick notes in Google Docs, Apple Notes, or Evernote**
* **Dedicated brainstorm sessions using mind mapping apps**

Once you’ve got ideas, validate them:

* **Keyword research**: Check demand using tools like Ubersuggest or Google Keyword Planner.
* **Social proof**: Search if questions or themes are buzzing on Reddit, Twitter, or Quora.
* **Ask quick surveys**: Post a poll on your stories or email list for instant feedback.

For more on favorite capture tools and organizing methods, see [The Tools I Use to Capture and Organize Ideas](https://ideavisionaction.com/blogging/the-tools-i-use-to-capture-and-organize-ideas-and-to-outline-write-and-edit-blog-posts/) or this real-world approach to [capturing blog post ideas](https://spinsucks.com/communication/capture-blog-post-ideas/). For validation, this thread on [idea validation tools](https://www.producthunt.com/p/general/what-tools-do-you-use-to-validate-ideas) lists fast, practical options.

# Writers’ Routines: From Research to Publishing: Outline a daily writing workflow that includes research, drafting, editing, and publishing

Great blog content starts with a reliable daily writing workflow. Most strong bloggers break the process down into repeatable steps for maximum output.

A smart daily routine can look like this:

1. **Morning research**: Scan top news, search rankings, or competitors and gather fresh sources.
2. **Focused drafting**: Turn off notifications and set a timer for 30–60 minutes of undistracted writing.
3. **Midday edits**: Step away for a break, then return with fresh eyes to edit your draft.
4. **SEO & graphics check**: Add images, check links, and tweak headlines for search power.
5. **Scheduling or publishing**: Use your editorial calendar to schedule the post, or hit publish if you’re ready.

Small daily refinements, like writing in short bursts or tying your editing to a certain time of day, can increase productivity fast.

# Growth Hacking Habits for Bloggers

Building your blog like a startup means working smarter, not just harder. Growth hacking habits are your secret weapon to quickly test what’s working, double down on results, and create feedback loops that continuously drive your audience and traffic numbers up. Let’s break down a few proven routines and systems anyone can master.

# Consistent Experimentation and A/B Testing: Applying Rapid Tests to Headlines, Content Types, and Calls-to-Action

In startup culture, testing is a way of life. Bring this mindset to your blog by running small, fast experiments each week.

* **Test headlines:** Write at least two different headlines for each post and see which one gets more clicks, shares, or engagement. Use tools like Google Optimize or experiments in your email newsletter.
* **Try new content types:** Swap formats occasionally. Compare performance between list posts, opinion pieces, tutorials, and case studies. Watch for spikes in pageviews, shares, or comments.
* **Switch up calls-to-action:** Tweak where and how you ask readers to subscribe or comment. Does a button at the end of the post work better, or is a pop-up more effective?

Keep a simple log of every experiment and the result. Over time, these tweaks create a playbook for what works on your blog. For some inspiration and actionable ideas, the guide on [17 Tactics to Grow Your Audience](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/8doqbj/growth_hacking_your_blog_17_tactics_to_grow_your/) covers practical tests that work for real people.

# Data-Driven Decision Making: Using Analytics as Your Compass

Checking your stats should be as regular as your morning coffee. Fast-growing blogs use data as their roadmap.

Do a daily or weekly check-in on:

* **Top-performing posts:** Spot what’s getting the most views and shares.
* **Traffic sources:** Are you gaining more visitors from social, search, or referrals this week?
* **Popular keywords:** See which search terms bring readers in.

Use these insights to choose future post topics and adjust your promotion. If a certain topic outperforms others, brainstorm spin-offs or sequels. If a social platform drives lots of visits, amp up your activity there. As you repeat this habit, your blog strategy becomes less about guesswork and more about following what readers actually want. To add structure to your review process, check out this breakdown of [growth hacking mindset habits](https://nadersabry.medium.com/what-is-a-growth-hacker-mindset-and-its-14-habits-f1739bb9952a).

# Growth Loops: Leveraging Content Distribution

In startups, a growth loop is a process that feeds itself. Bloggers can create this effect by building strong routines for sharing and syndicating content.

Here’s how to do it:

* Share every new post on multiple channels. This means Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and relevant forums or groups.
* Repurpose content: Turn a blog post into a carousel for Instagram or a quick video for TikTok or YouTube Shorts.
* Connect with other bloggers for guest posting and cross-promotions. When they link back to you, their audience discovers your blog.

Build a checklist for every post that includes where to share, how to repurpose, and ways to boost reach. Over time, each piece of content not only gets more eyes but also helps grow your audience for future posts. To see how startups engineer repeatable growth, see tips like those in this post on [blogging strategy for startups](https://medium.com/founders-focus/the-blogging-strategy-for-startups-0c57eb044dec).

# Building Relationships: Networking and Community as Startup Fuel

Building real relationships powers blog growth much like a good team fuels any strong startup. It’s not just about what you know or what you write, but who you connect with — online and offline. Blog communities open the door to new readers, partners, and even mentors. Focusing on daily connection habits will keep your blog moving forward and open up opportunities that algorithms alone can’t reach.

# Daily Outreach Rituals: Offer actionable tips for engaging with other bloggers, influencers, and readers every day

Building habits around outreach is the secret sauce that turns a blog into a community hub. A few small steps each day add up, helping you grow trusted connections while keeping your blog top-of-mind for readers and peers.

Here are practical ways to weave outreach into your daily routine:

* **Comment meaningfully** on one or two blogs you admire. Don’t just drop a link — add thoughtful insights or questions relevant to the post.
* **Share someone else’s post** on Twitter, LinkedIn, or your Instagram story. Tag the creator and include a quick note about what you loved. It’s an easy way to spark conversations and encourage reciprocity.
* **Send a short message** to a peer or influencer. This could be a thank you, a compliment, or a relevant question. Most long-term blogger friendships start with simple, genuine notes.
* **Reply to every comment** on your latest posts within 24 hours. Quick engagement builds trust and invites future participation.
* **Set aside 15 minutes** each morning for this habit. Add it to your checklist, calendar, or daily routine until it becomes second nature.

For more detail, read this straightforward guide on [making connections with other bloggers](https://www.margaretbourne.com/networking-with-bloggers-guide/). Staying consistent is the magic ingredient.

# Creating Value in Blogging Communities: Show how participating in forums, social media groups, and comments sections fosters growth

Active participation in blogging groups, niche forums, and comments sections is like planting seeds in dozens of gardens — you never know which will bloom. Consistent involvement gets your name around and shows you’re part of the community, not just taking from it.

Try these strategies for real value:

* Find two or three focused blogging forums or Facebook groups and set reminders to check in daily.
* Offer advice or answer questions in your area of expertise. Support others before asking for anything in return.
* Join group conversations, not just self-promotion threads. Share your story, tools, or lessons learned. Readers can spot authenticity a mile away.
* Use comment sections on industry blogs to add fresh angles, back up facts, or start helpful debates.

As you build your reputation, people will start to visit your blog organically through your contributions. This creates a steady flow of warm leads, collaboration invites, and even backlinks from trusted peers. For more on this topic, see [The Importance of Building Community on Your Blog](https://problogger.com/community-principles-of-successful-blogging-4/).

# Mentorship and Collaboration Routines: Explain the benefits of regular collaboration and mentorship for bloggers

Regular check-ins with mentors and collaborators can catapult your growth, shorten your learning curve, and spark creative breakthroughs you wouldn’t reach alone.

A few approaches to build these habits into your blogging week:

* **Mentorship check-ins:** Block a recurring time monthly or quarterly to chat with a mentor or experienced blogger. Come prepared with questions or insights.
* **Co-writing or guest posts:** Schedule regular swaps with other bloggers in your field. Co-create an article, interview each other, or run joint events to cross-pollinate audiences.
* **Small accountability groups:** Meet virtually every week or two to share progress, stuck points, and goals. Even three people is enough.
* **Collaboration projects:** Team up for workshops, free guides, or giveaways. Shared projects often get more attention and push everyone involved to do their best work.

Choosing community and collaboration over isolation is proven to expand your audience and keep motivation high. For inspiration, see these real-world examples of [networking for blogger collaboration](https://dmnews.com/how-to-network-for-blogger-collaboration-10-success-stories-from-the-field/), or explore this breakdown of [networking and collaboration benefits for traffic](https://problogger.com/traffic-technique-7-networking-and-collaboration/).

A culture of giving, connecting, and supporting keeps your blog growing — and makes the journey a lot more fun.

# Sustaining Growth: Iteration, Reflection, and Avoiding Burnout

Growth isn’t about hustle 24/7. For lasting success, you need routines that keep you sharp, adaptable, and rested. Startups build habits for steady feedback and healthy breaks; bloggers should do the same. This section explores simple systems for regular review, and how real rest and learning fuel stronger results over time.

# Review and Reflection Rituals: Describe regular reviews to assess progress, pivot strategy, and celebrate wins

Taking time to review each week acts as a progress check for your blog. These rituals aren’t just about fixing mistakes — they help you stay flexible and see how far you’ve come.

Photo by [▃](https://www.pexels.com/@corin)

Set aside 20–30 minutes weekly to:

* List what went well (traffic spikes, reader feedback, or a tricky post finished).
* Write down what didn’t go as planned, but skip blame — just note what got in your way.
* Spot patterns in wins and struggles. Is social traffic rising? Are certain post types getting more love?
* Celebrate small victories. Did a collaboration bring new eyes to your blog? Mark it down.
* Decide if you need to change your approach. Try doubling down on what works, or dropping what doesn’t.

If you want inspiration, check out this practical guide to starting a [weekly review and reflection ritual](https://www.aboutblank.blog/weekly-review/). It walks through the habit, plus includes a free template.

Regular reviews stop you from running on autopilot. They let you pivot fast, keep your motivation strong, and remind you that growth is happening — even if it’s slow some weeks.

# Building Healthy, Sustainable Habits: Share techniques for integrating rest, creative breaks, and learning into daily routines

Growing a blog is a marathon, not a sprint. Burnout kills momentum, so it’s smart to plant healthy habits early on. Small changes make a big impact.

To keep your energy and creativity up:

* Take short screen breaks every 60–90 minutes. Stand, stretch, or walk around.
* Block in time for learning. Reading one fresh post or listening to one podcast daily can spark ideas.
* Make downtime non-negotiable. Pick blocks in your week for activities you enjoy — cooking, a walk, or even doing nothing.
* Schedule regular sleep hours as if it’s a non-movable meeting. Good sleep sharpens thinking and mood.
* Try creative hobbies outside your blog. Drawing, photography, or even gardening can refresh your mind in ways writing alone can’t.
* Avoid all-day multitasking. Focus on single tasks for short bursts to boost output and lower stress.

Systems that work for one person may not fit another. The trick is to try things, and adjust until you find routines that stick. If you want a few frameworks, this list of [tips to build sustainable habits](https://lochtree.com/blogs/blog/tips-to-help-build-sustainable-habits) has easy, everyday ideas.

Putting your health and learning first lets you show up for your blog at your best. You’ll write smarter, work happier, and avoid the slow fade of creative exhaustion. Consistent rest and review don’t slow growth — they fuel it.

# Conclusion

Turning your blog into a growth engine works best when you treat daily habits like non-negotiable building blocks. Focus on strict routines for content creation, strong feedback loops, and healthy community interactions. Make time every week to review stats and reflect on your process. Build in rest and learning so burnout doesn’t stall your progress.

I figured out how to get it out of controller mode without being in-game. You need to edit the ""GameUserSettings.ini"" file. Mine was located here: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME_HERE\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\Config\Windows

Open the ""GameUserSettings"" file with Notepad (or whatever you use to edit) and use ctrl+F to find ""InputMode"" near the top. It should state as: (""FG.InputMode"", 1)

change the 1 to a 0

Save and close, boot up the game, it should now be back in mouse/keyboard mode.
************

TLDR: how do I re-enable keyboard/mouse mode without the use of a controller?

Hello, it seems controller support still needs some work in 1.1 as I am constantly getting locked into controller mode and cannot get past the ""welcome information"" box (which is also really annoying Coffee Stain, let me have the option to ""never show again"" please!) because the game completely disables ANY mouse/keyboard input! I play in remote play often so im usually going back and forth between K/M and controller and keep getting stuck. Right now, im away from home and trying to play remotely but literally cannot.

I have tried verifying my game files, disabling steam input, and re-installing but the settings will not change.

Coffee Stain, PLEASE make it so that the input automatically switches depending on the input that is being received. There are many PC games that do this!",5,1749654167.0,SatisfactoryGame,7,0.86,False

Let's face it, our wanderlust is a powerful beast, constantly whispering sweet nothings of exotic locales and sun-drenched beaches. But often, the hefty price tag on international flights throws a cold, unwelcome splash of reality on our dreamy visions. Fear not, fellow adventurers! There's a whole world out there that's surprisingly accessible, even when your bank account is whispering, ""Dude, chill."" Finding the **cheapest countries to fly to from USA** is an art form, a strategic game of skill and timing. It's about knowing where to look, when to book, and how to leverage every trick in the book. We're talking about that feeling of snagging an incredible flight deal – pure, unadulterated travel joy. Forget those picture-perfect Instagram feeds that make you question your life choices; affordable travel is real, and it's within your reach. This isn't about roughing it or sacrificing your comfort; it's about smart travel, about stretching your dollars without sacrificing the incredible experiences that await. Think about it: that extra grand you save on airfare could be the difference between a quick weekend getaway and a two-week immersion in a vibrant, new culture. So, buckle up, because we're about to embark on a journey to demystify the world of affordable international travel.

So, You Want to See the World on a Shoestring? Cracking the Code of Affordable Airfare

Wouldn't it be grand to jet off to a new country whenever the whim struck, without the existential dread of checking flight prices? For many of us, that feels like a pipe dream. But here's the scoop: the feeling of finally booking that unbelievably cheap flight is like striking gold. It’s a rush, a victory against the often-exorbitant cost of getting from point A to point B, especially when point B is across an ocean. We’ve all been there, right? Scrolling through flight aggregator sites, watching as the numbers fluctuate wildly, sometimes plummeting and sometimes skyrocketing for no discernible reason. It feels like playing the lottery, except the prize is a sunburn in a new country and bragging rights among your friends. But there's method to the madness, a pattern hidden within the chaos. It’s about understanding the factors that influence airfare, and trust me, there are quite a few. From the time of year you fly to the airline you choose, everything plays a role. Let's delve into the nitty-gritty of what makes a flight cheap, or conversely, what sends those prices through the roof. Consider it your crash course in becoming an airfare ninja.

Factors Influencing Flight Costs: Navigating the Airfare Rollercoaster

It’s a rollercoaster ride, isn’t it? The price of a plane ticket seems to have a life of its own, bouncing around with alarming unpredictability. But like any good thrill ride, there are forces at play that dictate its movement. Understanding these forces is key to finding those sweet, low prices. Think of it like a giant, global game of supply and demand, influenced by a plethora of external factors. Seasonality is a HUGE factor, no two ways about it. Trying to fly to Europe in August? Good luck! You’ll be competing with half the world for a seat, and the airlines know it. Conversely, traveling during the shoulder seasons – those magical times between peak and off-peak – can yield significant savings. They’re often still lovely times to visit, just with fewer crowds and lower prices. It's a win-win, if you ask me. The day of the week you fly also matters. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the sweet spot for departures, while flying on a Friday or Sunday is a surefire way to pay a premium. Think about it: most folks want to maximize their weekend, so demand is higher during those times. The time you book your flight is another piece of the puzzle. While there's no single ""magic"" time to book, generally speaking, booking too early or too late can cost you. A good rule of thumb is to start looking about 2-3 months out for international trips, but this can vary depending on the destination and the time of year. Don't forget about the airline itself! Budget carriers, while sometimes lacking in creature comforts (hello, questionable legroom!), can offer significant savings. However, be sure to factor in their baggage fees and other add-ons, as these can quickly negate any initial savings. Finally, don't underestimate the power of flexibility. If you can be flexible with your travel dates, your departure and arrival airports, and even your destination, you open yourself up to a whole world of potential deals. Sometimes the cheapest flight takes you to a nearby city, and you can simply take a train or bus to your final destination. It requires a little extra planning, but the savings can be well worth it.

Central and South America: A Treasure Trove of Affordable Destinations

Ah, Central and South America! A vibrant tapestry of cultures, stunning landscapes, and seriously affordable travel. For many Americans, these regions are just a hop, skip, and a jump away, both geographically and financially. While some destinations in these areas cater to the luxury market, there are countless others that offer incredible value for money, making them prime contenders for the **cheapest countries to fly to from USA**. Think about it: you can be soaking up sun on a Caribbean beach, exploring ancient ruins in the jungle, or hiking through dramatic mountain ranges, all without feeling like you need to take out a second mortgage to afford the flight. The proximity helps, of course, leading to shorter flight times and often more direct routes, which can translate to lower fares. But beyond just the airfare, the cost of living in many of these countries is significantly lower than in the US, meaning your travel dollars stretch much further. This allows you to enjoy delicious local food, find affordable accommodation, and participate in amazing activities without constantly watching your budget. It's a fantastic opportunity to experience diverse cultures, practice your Spanish (or Portuguese!), and create unforgettable memories without facing the sticker shock you might encounter in other parts of the world. From the bustling markets of Mexico City to the pristine beaches of Costa Rica to the majestic Andes of Peru, there's a destination in Central and South America to suit every taste and every budget. We're talking about places where your daily expenses for food, accommodation, and activities can be less than the cost of a single dinner out in many US cities. That's freeing, plain and simple. It allows for spontaneous adventures, trying new things, and truly immersing yourself in the local culture without feeling constrained by financial worries. This is where those ""wow, I can't believe how cheap this is!"" moments happen.

Mexico: Beyond the Beach Resorts

Let's talk Mexico, shall we? For many Americans, it's the closest international getaway, and happily, it's often one of the most affordable. While the all-inclusive resorts of Cancun and Cabo certainly exist (and can be pricey!), there's a whole other side to Mexico that's incredibly budget-friendly and utterly captivating. Think vibrant cities like Mexico City with its incredible street food scene and world-class museums, or the colonial charm of Oaxaca, renowned for its culinary delights and artisanal crafts. The interior of Mexico offers a rich cultural experience that's a far cry from the tourist traps. Flights to destinations like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Puebla are often significantly cheaper than those to the major resort towns, especially if you fly into one of the country's larger international airports and then take a domestic flight or bus to your final destination. Plus, once you're there, your money goes a long way. We're talking delicious tacos for a few dollars, comfortable guesthouses for very reasonable prices, and affordable transportation options like buses. The exchange rate is often favorable, making everything from souvenirs to experiences feel like a bargain. You can explore ancient ruins like Teotihuacan, wander through colorful markets, and soak in the lively atmosphere without draining your bank account.

Colombia: From Vibrant Cities to Lush Landscapes

Colombia has shed its past reputation and emerged as a truly incredible and affordable travel destination. Forget what you think you know; Colombia is a country of breathtaking beauty, warm people, and surprisingly low costs. Flights to major hubs like Bogota, Medellin, and Cartagena are often quite reasonable, especially when compared to flights to other South American countries. Once you're in Colombia, your money stretches remarkably far. The cost of living is low, meaning you can enjoy delicious food, comfortable accommodation, and exhilarating activities without breaking the bank. Explore the vibrant street art and buzzing nightlife of Medellin, wander through the colorful colonial streets of Cartagena, or hike through the stunning coffee region. Public transportation is affordable and efficient, making it easy to get around and explore different parts of the country. Colombia offers an incredible diversity of experiences, from the Caribbean coast to the Andes mountains, all within a budget-friendly framework. It's a country that will surprise and delight you with its beauty, its culture, and its affordability.

Guatemala: Ancient History and Natural Wonders

Flights to Guatemala City are often quite reasonable, and from there, getting around the country is both easy and inexpensive. Explore the breathtaking ancient Mayan ruins of Tikal, one of the largest archaeological sites in Mesoamerica. Wander through the charming colonial city of Antigua, a UNESCO World Heritage site nestled amongst volcanoes. Immerse yourself in the indigenous culture around Lake Atitlan, often described as one of the most beautiful lakes in the world. Guatemala offers incredible value for money. Accommodation, food, and activities are all remarkably affordable, allowing you to experience the country's rich history and natural beauty without overspending. You can hike volcanoes, visit vibrant markets, and learn about traditional weaving techniques, all on a budget that would be impossible in many other destinations.

Southeast Asia: An Adventurer's Paradise on a Budget

Alright, let's talk about a region that's practically synonymous with budget travel: Southeast Asia! This corner of the world is an absolute dream for adventurous souls who want to experience incredible culture, stunning scenery, and delicious food without spending a fortune. While the flight itself might seem like a significant chunk of change (it is, after all, a long-haul flight from the US), the cost of living in Southeast Asia is incredibly low. This means that once you arrive, your money goes an unbelievably long way. We're talking about comfortable guesthouses for the price of a dorm bed in many Western countries, delicious and abundant street food for just a few dollars a meal, and incredibly affordable transportation options like buses and trains. This makes Southeast Asia a fantastic option for extended travel, allowing you to explore multiple countries and truly immerse yourself in the region's diverse cultures without feeling rushed by budgetary constraints. Think about it: that expensive flight suddenly feels much more manageable when you know you can live like royalty (or at least very comfortably!) for a fraction of what you'd spend back home. From the bustling metropolises to the tranquil beaches to the ancient temples, Southeast Asia offers a never-ending array of experiences at a price point that's hard to beat.

Thailand: Land of Smiles and Affordable Wonders

Thailand, the ""Land of Smiles,"" is a perennial favorite for budget travelers, and for good reason! While flights to Bangkok can vary in price, they are often competitive, especially if you're flexible with your dates and willing to take advantage of deals.

Accommodation options range from budget-friendly guesthouses to surprisingly affordable mid-range hotels.

Malaysia is a fascinating melting pot of Malay, Chinese, and Indian cultures, which is reflected in its incredibly diverse and delicious food scene. Explore the modern marvels of Kuala Lumpur, with its iconic Petronas Twin Towers, wander through the charming colonial streets of Malacca, or relax on the beautiful beaches of the Perhentian Islands.

Strategic Booking and Travel Hacks: Becoming an Airfare Ninja

Finding those cheap flights isn't just about picking the right destination; it's also about being smart and strategic in your approach. Think of it as a treasure hunt, and you're the intrepid explorer armed with a map and a healthy dose of patience. Knowing the tricks of the trade can seriously impact the price you pay for your flight. It’s not just about luck; it’s about leveraging the tools and information available to you. We’ve all heard those stories of people snagging flights for ridiculously low prices, and while sometimes it is sheer luck, often it’s the result of being a savvy traveler. Being flexible is your superpower here, truly. The more wiggle room you have with your dates and times, the better your chances of finding a great deal. Consider flying mid-week, or on less popular days. Think about red-eye flights, which are often cheaper than daytime departures. Don't underestimate the power of flying into a nearby airport and using ground transportation to reach your final destination. Sometimes, the savings on the flight alone make the extra leg of the journey totally worth it. Utilizing flight comparison websites is an absolute must. These sites aggregate prices from multiple airlines, allowing you to quickly compare options and identify the cheapest fares. But don't stop there! Check the airline's website directly after finding a potential deal on a comparison site. Sometimes, the airline's direct price is even lower, or they might have special offers not listed elsewhere. Setting price alerts is another smart move. If you have a specific destination and time frame in mind, set up alerts on various flight tracking websites. You’ll be notified when prices drop, allowing you to jump on a good deal as soon as it becomes available. Being subscribed to airline newsletters and following them on social media can also give you a heads-up on flash sales and promotions. Consider flying during the shoulder seasons – those periods between peak and off-peak travel. The weather might still be pleasant, but the crowds are thinner and the prices are often lower. Finally, be open to flying into different airports within the same region. Sometimes, flying into a smaller or less popular airport can significantly reduce the cost of your flight. It requires a little extra planning for ground transportation, but the savings can be substantial. Becoming an airfare ninja is about being proactive, doing your research, and being willing to think outside the box. Every dollar saved on the flight is a dollar you can spend on experiences, delicious food, and unforgettable memories in your chosen destination!

The Hidden Costs: What Else to Consider Beyond Airfare

Okay, so you've found an incredibly cheap flight to that dreamy destination – awesome! But hold your horses for just a second. While airfare is often the biggest chunk of change when it comes to international travel, it's crucial to factor in the other potential costs to get a true picture of the trip's affordability. Think of it like budgeting for a home renovation; the cost of the materials is important, but you also need to consider labor, permits, and unforeseen issues. Travel is similar; there are layers to the financial cake. Visas, for instance, can sometimes add an unexpected cost. Do you need one for your chosen country? How much does it cost, and how long does it take to obtain? These are important questions to answer *before* you book that non-refundable flight. Travel insurance is another crucial consideration. While it's not mandatory for all destinations, it's an absolute must-have for international travel. Things can go wrong – lost luggage, canceled flights, medical emergencies – and travel insurance can save you a massive headache and a huge financial burden. Don't skimp on this; it's peace of mind worth paying for, believe me. The cost of getting from the airport to your accommodation should also be factored in. Is there affordable public transportation? Or will you need to take a taxi, which could be expensive depending on the country? Researching local transportation options and costs beforehand can help you budget accordingly. And speaking of budgeting, don't forget about the cost of living once you're at your destination. While the countries we've discussed are generally considered affordable, prices for accommodation, food, activities, and souvenirs will vary. Doing a little research on average daily costs can help you set a realistic budget and avoid any unpleasant surprises. Finally, and this is something often overlooked, consider any potential exit fees or taxes that some countries impose when you leave. These are usually a small amount, but it's better to be aware of them beforehand. By factoring in these ""hidden"" costs, you'll have a much more accurate picture of the total expense of your trip, allowing you to budget effectively and avoid any last-minute financial stress.

1l8uwbr,https://i.redd.it/enzif28lbb6f1.jpeg,My thoughts on camping in the valley,"Was there in the last few days. My group was at Lower Pines. 

The good: There is nothing like being there at night, going to bed and waking up in the Valley. We had a doe that came by to feed and visit regularly so I made sure I was up by 5 am and sat in my chair with a cup of coffee. And having the sun set out of the valley but still shining on Half Dome right above you is pretty damn cool. 

The bears are there. I heard at least 2 rubber bullet shots on two separate days. Had our canopy and stove knocked over one day while we were gone (all food and scented items were in the bear box). And as I was up so early, I also had one come real close to our camp in the early morning. I let him know I was there and he casually course corrected out of there as if he were used to it. We came across another on trail. Be prepared and expect it. 

As you know, every trail out of the valley is hard. Go up to Nevada falls and feel a little wiped?  Take a nice cold plunge in the Merced River right by your campsite. There’s no sense of urgency. I definitely want to float down the river next time. 

Ride bikes. If you don’t bring your own, rent them. The perspective you get from being on a bike is way better than you do from your car. It is also much easier to get to the major locations by bike. 

The other parts of the park are insanely spectacular. It is worth seeing Tenaya Lake and Tuolomne Meadows for a day. Leave the valley if you can. 

The Pizza. I kept seeing on here people say they like the pizza and half the people say the pizza sucks. I lived in Italy for 3 years, had the best pizza in the world. I will tell you it’s just wood oven pizza. If you don’t know what that is and expect your local joint from back home, it’s not it. No, it’s not burnt, that’s what happens in a wood oven. 

The bad: That being said I run into a couple negative things. While preparing to enjoy said pizza after an all day hike, I noticed the soft drink machine was out of order at The Deck. They just gave you a cup and had to go to the cafeteria to get a drink, no problem. Well, they ran out of ice in the cafeteria. It is a minor gripe. 

I also overheard an Aramark employee tell a camper the pool at Curry Village was closed because Aramark did not want to bother running and would only consider doing so if enough people complained. Don’t know how true that is, just saying what I heard him say. The pool at the lodge was open btw. 

The showers are horrible. One set of showers for 3 campgrounds and Curry Village. $5 for each shower in what I can only describe as an almost boot camp style situation. It is unacceptable IMO and not worth the price of admission. But, I did see a lot of people doing what I am not going to tell you what to do. 

The shuttle can be a can of sardines. This is not anyone’s fault, just be aware and be prepared. Especially around Happy Isles and Mirror Lake, that thing gets packed tight.

Those days, I used to live near the mountains, surrounded by fog and mist. It was a testament to the Earth's remarkable geological activity that gives rise to such beautiful landscapes. Its ability to create through destruction made me realize that destruction may also bring hope.

There was a dirt road nearby. Its markings captured the movements of vehicles that time had once pushed forward, leaving behind not just tracks but memories. The road was still there, unchanged, reminding me of my father, with whom I had shared my last coffee on a Wednesday.

Then time happened, as it always does, and I lost him. Time won again, turning a happy, healthy man, whose voice once roared like a lion’s, into a mere memory. Time had become my enemy, transforming the physical into recollection, the solid into echoes.

My belief in God was never constant. One day I would argue for His existence, the next I would deny it. My father’s death wasn’t a small incident. It shook my entire life, even affecting my job. The void he left behind devoured everything, like a black hole consuming matter.

All I could think about was healing; spiritual healing; as a way to escape the mental agony. That’s when I remembered my friend Adrian, who lived in Brazil. He often posted about spiritual healing on Facebook and would frequently tag me. One post talked about how a timely meeting with a spiritual healer could change everything.

Adrian hadn’t become a healer by choice. He was made one; by time and by suffering. He lost his parents at the age of eight. Though he went on to live with his grandparents and uncle, the real shift came after his wife's death. He couldn't bear it. He withdrew for months, isolated and broken, until he met a spiritual healer who directed him towards the path to peace; the very path that not just heals but takes away the scars chiseled by time within us. And eventually he transformed into a spiritual healer himself. He once wrote, **""The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami completely changed me. It showed me how fragile life is. My wife’s death was just one of the many tragedies this world endures.""**

I wanted to reach out to him earlier, but I kept putting it off. And slowly, time triumphed again. It made me forget the roar, the laughter, the man himself. But the agony remained. Because time may take away what’s tangible, but it always leaves behind imprints.

A year later, on that same forgotten road; the one less traveled; I met with a terrible accident. I broke my neck and was temporarily unable to walk. The pain was twofold: physical and mental. And with that came the knocking of old memories; my father’s death, and all the comforting thoughts that had turned into haunting ones. It became threefold, more unbearable than ever.

A month passed, and I recovered. But the scars didn’t. Time is strange. It takes away moments, but never the scars. The imprints remain, carved into memory. And the worst part? Whether a memory is joyful or painful, it haunts just the same.

Eventually, things began to improve. A ray of hope pierced through the darkness. I started a small business. It turned out to be profitable, not just financially but spiritually. It cast a shadow over the wounds that time had left behind.

During this time, I recalled the moments I cherished with my father rather than his death. I was trying to look at the positive side of life, letting the scars left by time sob in ignorance.

But there’s only one thing that’s unchanging: change itself. And change is nothing but a synonym for challenge. With change comes a new challenge, and three months later, it did. Once again, time betrayed me.

I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. That news shattered me. It didn’t just hurt; it drained the life out of me. It was time's way of asserting dominance once again, its reminder of the prowess it carries.

The illness together with past traumas left me with no choice but to seek Adrian’s help. I was hopeful if not determined.

He was based in Brazil, about 50 miles from the Amazon rainforest. After a 12-hour flight, I finally met him. He looked troubled, as if something heavy weighed on his mind.

“You’re late. Too late, actually,” Adrian said, staring at me while puffing on a thick, black cigar.

“But why?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“You’re here because of your suffering, right? But you shouldn’t have come at its peak. Now, it’s not me who can help you. It’s **Zimazari**. Only he can.”

**“Zimazari?”** I repeated.

“Yes. The man who helped me with my pain. Just a month before the Indian Ocean tsunami, I met him. After that, my agony vanished.”

""He doesn't speak, but you'll hear him, he doesn't see but you'll feel his gaze, he doesn't hear, but he'll know what you want to talk about""

The cigar smoke made me cough.

“And where do I find him?” I asked.

“You don’t. Just head into the forest. Walk a mile in, then call his name. He’ll come running; naked. Shame, fame, money, lust; none of that matters to him. He’s risen above it all. So don’t be startled by how he appears.”

And so I left.

The forest was eerily silent, as if it were listening to my thoughts. After walking more than a mile, I shouted his name. Then I heard footsteps; someone running towards me.

**It was him. Tall and thin, with a beard that touched his navel. His eyes, gray and fiery, seemed to glow. His hair fell below his waist. His fingernails were long, curved, almost unnatural.**

He didn’t speak, but I heard him inside my head: “Follow me.”

We walked deeper into the jungle. Eventually, he stopped at a crater-like opening in the ground. Its bottom wasn’t visible; just a deep, dark void. It looked like a black hole. Vast and Terrifying. I screamed, but the echo was too loud to bear.

Zimazari lit a torch and closed his eyes. My eyes shut on their own. Then I heard his voice inside my head again, chanting something in an unfamiliar language. The chant continued for nearly an hour. I felt the weight of my suffering slowly lift, as though it were leaking out of me.

When I opened my eyes, Zimazari threw the torch into the hole, and the crater sealed itself.

**“Leave this place now,”** I heard once more in my head. Then he vanished.

I ran through the forest, shaken but strangely at peace. For the first time in years, I felt free, like all my grief had been washed away.

I returned to Brazil, then back home. Everything felt fine. Better than fine. I was happy.

But not for long.

**A month later, I heard about a devastating volcanic eruption that claimed thousands of lives. At first, I ignored it. But something about it nagged at me.**

And then I remembered what Adrian had told me. After he met Zimazari, the 2004 tsunami happened. And now this eruption.

Something wasn’t right.

I called Adrian.

“David,” he said as soon as he answered. “I know why you’re calling. The volcano…”

“You knew?” I asked.

“David, you’re free now, aren’t you? But freedom always comes with a cost. You felt the ground shake, didn’t you? That wasn’t just you.""

“You never told me. I didn’t ask for this,” I said. “You may have become a monster, but I’m not. I know the tsunami was your fault. And now this… You became a healer just to atone for what you did.”

“David, I helped you,” he said, disturbingly calm.""
""I didn’t want to tell you, David. I couldn’t. After the tsunami… I swore I’d never send anyone else to him. But you were drowning.” he ended.

I couldn’t breathe. The weight of this truth was crushing.

“I don’t want to live with this,” I said. “It’s suffocating.”

“This is how you create another agony,” Adrian replied. “More painful than the ones you’ve endured. What’s done can’t be undone. Learn to live with it.”

**It was in that moment I realized: Zimazari's healing reaches the the earth's core, creating strong vibrations that trigger catastrophic disasters.**

And it meant time never betrayed me. It wasn’t the enemy. I was. Time’s scars may never fade, but trying to undo them might leave you with even deeper ones, from which the pus of regret forever oozes.

And despite all the healing, I still remain **injured.**",3,1749653965.0,nosleep,0,0.8,False

I’m barely scraping by, dependent on caffeine everyday to function. I wake up and feel zero emotion and complete anhedonia and am just tired, I use coffee to give me false energy and then I’m on the verge of a breakdown and having suicidal ideation for the rest of the day. I’ve tried healing for years now. Tried Breathwork, kept me in a state of suppression. Tried therapy and felt misunderstood by all of them and quit each one eventually. Tried 12 step and felt gaslit by people there so I left. 

Not to mention the attitudes of society around me and how everyone tells me no one is coming to save me. Well yeah no shit I know that. That’s why I tried all these things. And when I say nothing works people try to guilt trip me and deny my reality and imply that I must be doing something wrong and that just adds to everything. 

I’m probably going to end my life soon. I don’t see any use living in this hellscape. The world is clearly about to reach a critical mass with fascism back, everything is individualistic and commodified. Whats the point in healing if society’s values are heavily individualistic and completely alien to how humans evolved. It gives me so much despair. I imagine people are going to tell me to stop acting like a victim, pull myself together after this post. I just don’t see the point anymore. I’ve genuinely lost the meaning to live.

Please take a moment during your morning coffee break to CALL OUR ASSEMBLYMAN Alex Bores (212-605-0937 ) to ask what he has done to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie to stop blocking the bill Assemblyman Bores himself co-sponsored to CLOSE THE INTOXICATION RAPE LOOPHOLE IN NYS LAW (Assembly Bill 101). It only takes a few seconds. If you feel like it, reply “Done”.

You don’t need to be an expert on the issue. Are you a parent? Do you have a daughter? We hear the bill is being blocked by NYS Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. When was the last time Alex called Speaker Heastie specifically about this? Has he met with Speaker Heastie? How long ago? It’s great that Assemblyman Bores Is a co-sponsor of the bill. It’s great that he’s attended rallies in support of the bill. But that was true last year and the year before. What practical steps have been taken in Albany behind doors to get It passed and on Governor Hochul’s desk?

TEL. 212-605-0937

It’s a disgraceful embarrassment to our state. Cuomo - yes, Cuomo - proposed fixing this in 2019 - six years ago. Dems can’t cos-play #MeToo women’s rights heroes and not have a valid answer for this.

New York Assembly Bill A101 prohibits the use of a victim's intoxication as a defense in sex crimes, specifically when the victim is under the extreme influence of a substance rendering them unable to control their actions or express a lack of consent. It applies to offenses like sexual misconduct, rape in the third degree, and related crimes. 

This bill removes the possibility of using a victim's intoxication as a justification for a sex crime. 
Call Alex Bores now.

There was a dirt road nearby. Its markings captured the movements of vehicles that time had once pushed forward, leaving behind not just tracks but memories. The road was still there, unchanged, reminding me of my father, with whom I had shared my last coffee on a Wednesday.

Then time happened, as it always does, and I lost him. Time won again, turning a happy, healthy man, whose voice once roared like a lion’s, into a mere memory. Time had become my enemy, transforming the physical into recollection, the solid into echoes.

1. I mostly pay for us when we eat out. This comes to about $200-300 spent on her a month. She buys me coffee or snacks here and there.
2. When we go out with each others’ friends, we will cover the share for the other person. However, as we hang out with a group (Group A) of her friends pretty often, I have been paying for my own share whenever we hang with Group A.
3. Holidays are split equally.

Recently, she has asked if I could cover my own share for dinners with her other friends (outside of Group A) if it comes up to about more than $100 per person (such as birthday dinners, weddings or parties etc). 

In my opinion, if we are hanging out with her friends, she should pay for our share. I also pay for her share when we hang out with my friends. However she said that as I make 3x more than her, she feels like I should be covering my own share instead since the costs of paying for me impacts her savings more.

To me, I can’t understand why she doesn’t want to pay for me when such events happen only a few times a year. She says she feels I’m stingy since she’s only asking me to cover my own share for these “more expensive dinners”, and it doesn’t impact my wallet much.

Am I stingy? How would you deal with this situation?

This is my 2nd E3 with my current company amongst many overall E3's.

My Company just renewed my E3 extension for another 2 years and I received the I-797 approval form. I need to travel outside of the US soon and therefore need to schedule my E3 stamp appointment in a US Consulate soon. I'm based in Florida and I cannot go all the way to Australia to renew the stamp.

I can do it in Canada since I am a dual Canadian citizen and did it last time which was fairly 'easy' at the consulate in Toronto, however my dilemma is that my company only reimburses me for the appointment fee and not the entire trip itself. Last time I did this in Toronto I had to spent almost 7 days there waiting for my passport and it was a really expensive trip just to renew a visa stamp!

I am thinking of renewing the stamp and making the appointment at a US consulate in Mexico since it will be so much more affordable (I calculated I could save at least $500 in total). But my company's immigration lawyers who they use advise against it saying Mexican consulates are not that experienced with Third Country nationals, especially in dealing with E3's and there is a chance I could get an ""Administrative Review"" answer (I've had this before and this is *really bad news!*) or even worse a denial because they dont know how to process the E3 (sounds stupid I know, but I can see that), meaning I wouldn't be able to fly back into the US since I wont have the new E3 and my old one would have expired by that time.

But in doing some research it looks like Mexico *does* do Third Country National visa stamp renewals and there are even some Australians who have had E3 visa renewal runs in Mexico. The main reason really is the cost, but also, I think if I am going to spend potentially up to 7 or 10 days, I would prefer it in Mexico as culturally that would be a much nicer experience. I guess one thing to note is that if I do choose to renew in Toronto again, I can work in my company's office since we have a location in Toronto, but in Mexico I would need to work from hotels, Air Bnb's, coffee shops and rely on potentially crappy internet or other miscellaneous issues that could impede my day to day logging in for work.

Does anyone see any risk in doing the E3 renewal in Mexico as opposed to Canada? Would you save the hundreds of dollars and risk something going wrong with the visa or just pay for another expensive trip and have it done in Canada?",1,1749653610.0,USCIS,2,1.0,False

I’m writing this with a heavy heart. My cousin (we’ll call D 30M) has been in a relationship for about 12 years with a woman (C 30F). Over the past three years, their relationship has taken a dark turn and become extremely toxic emotionally, mentally, and now physically abusive.

It started when C cheated on him. Everyone in the family, including myself and D’s older sister (we’ll call her S), advised him to leave. But he stayed. Since then, things have escalated dramatically.

C now:

Tracks D’s location constantly.
Accuses him of cheating almost daily.
Has become physically abusive.
Just a month ago, they had a fight, and she threw hot coffee at him. Last week, she pepper sprayed him and cut up all of his work clothes.
She controls the apartment they live in (it's only in her name), which complicates things further. But even after these violent episodes, D keeps going back.
My cousin S and I are deeply worried. We’ve been discussing ways to help him, but we’re hitting a wall. Every time we try to support him in leaving, he goes back to her apartment anyway. It’s heartbreaking to watch, and we’re afraid for his safety.

He’s not just emotionally manipulated—he’s being physically harmed. But he won’t leave. We know this is the cycle of abuse, and that victims often struggle to break free. But we’re thinking of ways to help him without pushing him further into isolation.

What can we do? Are there resources, legal steps, or specific approaches that work when trying to help a male victim of domestic abuse?

We want to be there for him, not alienate him. But we also don’t want to just sit back while this continues.

Any advice, experience, or guidance is appreciated.

Thank you.

Now coming to the part why i want to quit:
1) The future of my department is so worse that the promotion will be after 5 years if we’re lucky because i know someone from the department who worked for 13 years in the same position and also if you get promoted the job roles doesn’t vary or upgrade in any sense. 
2)The work environment is awful, it literally feels like i’m coming to a primary school at this age(for eg. my officer gives a sh1t if i get up to grab a coffee) 
3)One good thing is there’s not much risk or work pressure but this good thing has turned the office into hell as the officer has a lot of free time in his hand he wants to torture everyone in the office instead of chilling out in his cabin. 
4)I genuinely feel this isn’t my thing nor do i want to see myself doing this same job for the next 35 years. 
5)i know the officer is also a government employee and he’ll get retired after 10 years but he acts like he owns everyone there,he doesn’t let me learn new things or improve in work and he’s so smart in torturing me that you can’t complain about that to head office(for eg. He gives me bills to take it to treasury which i 8 kms from the office and when i return back he gives me another one to take it again by saying he forgot to do that) 
Last but not the least i work there as a SDA(Second division assistant) and i’m in my probation period and i had to join the job while i was in 8th sem so i do have some backlogs from there and few previous semesters.. i feel depressed every single day thinking about this,please i want some opinions and advices on this!!

I (32M) was supposed to marry Emily (30F) last year. We’d been dating for 4 years, and I proposed after we bought a house together. At first, things were fine. Emily was sweet, charming, and we had a lot in common—or so I thought.

Things started to unravel the second we got engaged.

Emily transformed into someone I didn’t even recognize. Suddenly, every tiny detail about the wedding was a battle, and I was always on the losing side. I’m not talking about simple disagreements—she was screaming at vendors, demanding to be treated “like royalty,” threatening to fire people constantly, and even kicked out her best friend of 20 years from the bridal party for “looking too pretty in the dress.”

Then there was her mother—Catherine, my now thankfully former future MIL. Oh. My. God.

Catherine treated me like I was garbage from the start. Always making jokes about my “modest upbringing,” questioning if my salary was enough to support a “queen” like her daughter, and constantly telling me I was “lucky” Emily even looked at me. But once we were engaged, she went full monster-in-law. She would call me at work to “remind” me about the prenup (which Emily drafted with her help), tried to sneak in changes to the guest list to include random “business connections,” and even made racist comments about my side of the family (I’m half Puerto Rican—she’s very white and very proud of that).

The only person who ever seemed sane in that whole family was Emily’s younger sister, Lily (28F). She was everything Emily wasn’t—calm, grounded, thoughtful. She even apologized for her mom’s behavior more than once and started casually checking in on me after big blowups between Emily and me.

Anyway, things came to a head the week of the wedding. Emily had scheduled a “bachelorette detox spa retreat” that she made all her bridesmaids—including her visibly pregnant cousin—attend, and came back even more unbearable. She screamed at the caterer for not having gold leaf on the desserts. Gold. Leaf.

She called me that night and said, and I quote:

“If you can’t give me the kind of wedding I deserve, maybe I should find someone who can.”

That hit hard. I was already second-guessing everything, but that was the final straw.

I confided in Lily, told her I didn’t think I could go through with it, and she said something I’ll never forget:

“Then don’t. Better now than 10 years into a miserable marriage. You deserve someone who loves you for who you are—not just what you can provide.”

The night before the wedding, Emily and her mom ambushed me at my place, yelling about how “everything better be perfect,” and Catherine even slapped me across the face when I said I was having doubts.

That was it.

I left.

I left them screaming at my front door, texted the groomsmen and my parents, and canceled everything. I paid off the vendors who hadn’t been paid yet and ghosted Emily completely. Didn’t even show up the next morning. I went to the mountains with a friend for a week. Just disappeared.

Of course, Emily and her mom lost their minds. They blew up my phone, smeared me online, told everyone I “abandoned her,” and even filed a small claim for “emotional distress.” (Didn’t go anywhere.)

But here’s where it gets crazier.

Lily stayed in touch. Not in a weird way. Just… checking on me, sending support, letting me know not everyone in her family was out for blood. Over time, we started talking more. A coffee here, a lunch there. One night, she admitted she’d always admired how I treated people with respect—especially compared to how her sister treated everyone like dirt.

It wasn’t a rebound. It wasn’t fast. It was slow, thoughtful, and real.

Last month, Lily and I got married. Quiet ceremony. Only 12 people. In a park. No gold leaf. Just love.

Now Emily and her mom are exploding. Saying I “stole Lily,” that we were “emotionally cheating,” that I’m disgusting, that I ruined their family. Even some of Emily’s friends have messaged me calling me a homewrecker.

My family and real friends are supportive. They say I dodged a bullet and found someone genuine. But I still feel weird about how it all went down. Lily says I shouldn’t feel guilty for choosing peace over chaos.

So… Reddit, AITA?

now my other problem ive been out for awhile. both as a bisexual and as non binary. altho we didnt start there. i was around 9 when i told my mother i was gay. her first words were M:""dont label yourself"" and then she never brought it up again. few years later i came out as genderfluid (at the time) and i asked her if she understood what that meant. she said yes. few years later i was talking about it and she asks M:""why cant you just be bi? that sounds like being bi"". she was confusing gender and sexuality. i then had to explain that i was both bi and genderfluid. then after awhile i explained non binary to her. and from the start ive told her my preferred name. not once has she used it proudly until this year. because i told her i would beat her ass otherwise. ik im the ass for that but she would deadname me any other way. she even went as far as to justify my sister outright refusing to. saying M:""you'll always be her baby sister"" now heres the thing. when i came out i cut off my old self. nothing about my younger self is in this body. its both a way for me to cope with trauma and to find comfort in myself. that ""baby sister"" is dead. shes been dead since 9. shes been dead for almost 8 years. any time i bring it up to my sister she starts to cry over it. and my mom just says M:""im trying"" and then deadnames me five seconds later. then while i was brushing my teeth one day she was talking to me and we were annoyed at each other and she said my dead name so i said ""say that name again im gonna bust your ass (moms legal name)"" she doesnt like when i use her legal name but mom isnt her legal name so i see no problem 😒 now shes actually making an effort after i isolate myself after theses fights. i even get my grandma involved.

I use wet wipes and bidet after wiping with paper. 

I shower and change clothes everyday and i still smell like feces. People around me sniff a lot when im around and talking behind my back that i smell like shit. This problem has ruined my daily life.

1l8ug4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1l8ug4k/tip_our_staff/,“Tip Our Staff”,"I’m a floral designer and worked for a small retail flower shop for about nine months. The owners included an option to “tip our staff” on the online checkout page. On average, there would be between $50-$100 in tips per week from online orders. Some customers would even indicate in the comment field that they intended the tip go to the delivery driver. However, the owners kept all tips collected and claimed to use all the money to provide bottled water, keurig coffee pods, and “snacks”. 

Having worked in a tipped economy (restaurants) in the past, I disagreed with how the owners were handling tip money, especially since the staff had no say in how the money was spent. 

If you ordered something online and opted to include an amount to “tip our staff” how would you feel knowing the owner collected that money and had full discretion on how it was dispersed?",2,1749652891.0,tipping,1,0.76,False

I've noticed that people in this community give very mixed advice regarding manifesting ""the impossible."" i think the record needs to be set straight that literally anything imaginable is possible, and neville goddard said it himself. if bringing back the dead or drastically changing your appearance or shifting is impossible, why is manifesting some free coffee or spare change possible? you don't get to cherrypick what the law of assumption works on, it's all the exact same mechanics. until there is ""definitive, scientific proof"" on how the law of assumption works, taking the plentiful ancedotes on manifesting the ""impossible"" needs to be taken as seriously as ""small manifestations."" 

to be clear, no one in this community or otherwise has a solid scientific foundation for the law of assumption. without getting into the nitty gritty, i've spent years of my life reading into it, and the most i can say exists, with my unprofessional opinion, is there's unfinished understandings of quantum mechanics that leaves it open as a probability and numerous pieces of credible ancedotal evidence. there isn't any evidence that would allow for a scientific claim to be made about the law of assumption, and that applies to other similar concepts such as astral projection, remote viewing, shifting/quantum jumping, etc. it isn't proven but it definitely isn't unproven. and if you can experience it yourself, you've proved it to yourself (if you're okay accepting you didn't isolate every other variable in a scientific experiment to ensure it wasn't something else). and until someone does just that in a lab, it won't be proven to anyone outside of themselves, and that makes sense because researching needs funding and something deemed ""woo"" is looked down upon. unfortunately, most notable ""doctors"" who openly discuss manifestation as real happen to be quacks and grifters, thus making the chances of a serious study into manifestation lower overall. but the lack of a scientific claim doesn't mean it isn't real, it literally just may not be researched yet or beyond our current technology, and clearly anyone who practices it can vouch that SOMETHING is definitely happening. i'm fine with all of that and thus feel maybe it could be stumbled upon at some point in life. especially since we already have adjacent concepts that feed very easily into the law of assumption.

where am i going with this? i'm saying that no one actually knows the extent of manifestation. but if you're in this sub and agree with neville, you should agree anything is possible. aligning yourself closer to ""reality"" by saying it's impossible to manifest certain things does not make you more credible or grounded than anyone else. this misinformation causes people to question if they can achieve things that are obviously possible. the other day i saw someone asking if they can revise a grade.. honestly, i think the people who keep distancing themselves from manifesting the impossible are the ones muddying the waters for newcomers. it's confusing if there isn't a clear consensus on the law. in this community, the clear consensus is SUPPOSED to be Neville's books. there are other communities geared towards different interpretations of the law and people are free to go there instead. i was always drawn to neville because he was the only guy who wasn't arbitrarily excluding certain things from being manifested. let's not ruin that here, please.

id like to bring up one more point, which is that i think there can sometimes be good in dissuading manifesting certain things. for example, if someone is grieving the death of someone they love, they should focus on grieving instead of trying to manifest them back. although manifesting anything is possible, it is *usually* more difficult and time-consuming because it's harder to accept as true. and the kind of person who can accept an ""out there"" concept as true usually needs to be in a good frame of mind so they can accept it without becoming obsessive or desperate (clear marks of someone who doesn't have what they want...). simply put, if your emotions are running extremely high, you need to focus on creating emotional safety for yourself with your current beliefs before you incorporate something else. otherwise, you risk putting manifestation on a pedestal and eventually becoming disappointed when it obviously never works. yes, manifesting takes work, it's only the mental work of accepting it as yours and that can be a lot harder than it sounds depending on the desire. so, if someone is grieving, they'd probably spend an obsessive amount of time attempting to manifest something unsuccessfully, delay their own emotional processing, and end up way more hurt than before. as someone who has manifested successfully and unsuccessfully, the successes always felt good and easy the entire way through. 

TLDR: the law of assumption isn't a scientific fact, it's ancedotal. our basis of the law is neville goddard, who said anything is possible. stop spreading misinformation on the extent of the law. however, despite anything being possible, be careful not to encourage manifestation in lieu of healing for the vulnerable.

This trip was for my wedding weekend, so we had a full schedule and zero flexibility to manage housing issues. Despite clear violations of Airbnb standards, Airbnb is offering just $200.

List of issues:
•     Listing did not match real condition
•	Found bugs in towels, dirty sheets, unclean coffee appliances
•	AC stopped working upstairs
•	Host left unlocked room with TV on, we thought someone was still in the house
•	Property was in noticeably poor condition vs. listing photos
•	Host refused to take responsibility
•	Airbnb support says $200 is the “max” despite documented issues
•	First Airbnb agent actually recommended I request a full refund
•	Airbnb is now hiding behind the 72-hour policy, despite clear documentation and wedding conflict during stay

Has anyone had success pushing Airbnb beyond a lowball offer like this when there’s clear evidence?
Is there a direct way to escalate to Trust & Safety or Executive Support beyond the standard help flow?

I’m trying to resolve this in good faith, but the current response feels dismissive given the condition of the property and the fact that Airbnb’s own agent said a refund was appropriate. I provided damning evidence, any advice would be appreciated!

1l8uef0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1l8uef0/injured/,Injured,"Those days, I used to live near the mountains, surrounded by fog and mist. It was a testament to the Earth's remarkable geological activity that gives rise to such beautiful landscapes. Its ability to create through destruction made me realize that destruction may also bring hope.

There was a dirt road nearby. Its markings captured the movements of vehicles that time had once pushed forward, leaving behind not just tracks but memories. The road was still there, unchanged, reminding me of my father, with whom I had shared my last coffee on a Wednesday.

Then time happened, as it always does, and I lost him. Time won again, turning a happy, healthy man, whose voice once roared like a lion’s, into a mere memory. Time had become my enemy, transforming the physical into recollection, the solid into echoes.

My belief in God was never constant. One day I would argue for His existence, the next I would deny it. My father’s death wasn’t a small incident. It shook my entire life, even affecting my job. The void he left behind devoured everything, like a black hole consuming matter.

All I could think about was healing; spiritual healing; as a way to escape the mental agony. That’s when I remembered my friend Adrian, who lived in Brazil. He often posted about spiritual healing on Facebook and would frequently tag me. One post talked about how a timely meeting with a spiritual healer could change everything.

Adrian hadn’t become a healer by choice. He was made one; by time and by suffering. He lost his parents at the age of eight. Though he went on to live with his grandparents and uncle, the real shift came after his wife's death. He couldn't bear it. He withdrew for months, isolated and broken, until he met a spiritual healer who directed him towards the path to peace; the very path that not just heals but takes away the scars chiseled by time within us. And eventually he transformed into a spiritual healer himself. He once wrote, **""The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami completely changed me. It showed me how fragile life is. My wife’s death was just one of the many tragedies this world endures.""**

I wanted to reach out to him earlier, but I kept putting it off. And slowly, time triumphed again. It made me forget the roar, the laughter, the man himself. But the agony remained. Because time may take away what’s tangible, but it always leaves behind imprints.

A year later, on that same forgotten road; the one less traveled; I met with a terrible accident. I broke my neck and was temporarily unable to walk. The pain was twofold: physical and mental. And with that came the knocking of old memories; my father’s death, and all the comforting thoughts that had turned into haunting ones. It became threefold, more unbearable than ever.

A month passed, and I recovered. But the scars didn’t. Time is strange. It takes away moments, but never the scars. The imprints remain, carved into memory. And the worst part? Whether a memory is joyful or painful, it haunts just the same.

Eventually, things began to improve. A ray of hope pierced through the darkness. I started a small business. It turned out to be profitable, not just financially but spiritually. It cast a shadow over the wounds that time had left behind.

During this time, I recalled the moments I cherished with my father rather than his death. I was trying to look at the positive side of life, letting the scars left by time sob in ignorance.

But there’s only one thing that’s unchanging: change itself. And change is nothing but a synonym for challenge. With change comes a new challenge, and three months later, it did. Once again, time betrayed me.

I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. That news shattered me. It didn’t just hurt; it drained the life out of me. It was time's way of asserting dominance once again, its reminder of the prowess it carries.

The illness together with past traumas left me with no choice but to seek Adrian’s help. I was hopeful if not determined.

He was based in Brazil, about 50 miles from the Amazon rainforest. After a 12-hour flight, I finally met him. He looked troubled, as if something heavy weighed on his mind.

“You’re late. Too late, actually,” Adrian said, staring at me while puffing on a thick, black cigar.

“But why?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“You’re here because of your suffering, right? But you shouldn’t have come at its peak. Now, it’s not me who can help you. It’s **Zimazari**. Only he can.”

**“Zimazari?”** I repeated.

“Yes. The man who helped me with my pain. Just a month before the Indian Ocean tsunami, I met him. After that, my agony vanished.”

""He doesn't speak, but you'll hear him, he doesn't see but you'll feel his gaze, he doesn't hear, but he'll know what you want to talk about""

The cigar smoke made me cough.

“And where do I find him?” I asked.

“You don’t. Just head into the forest. Walk a mile in, then call his name. He’ll come running; naked. Shame, fame, money, lust; none of that matters to him. He’s risen above it all. So don’t be startled by how he appears.”

And so I left.

The forest was eerily silent, as if it were listening to my thoughts. After walking more than a mile, I shouted his name. Then I heard footsteps; someone running towards me.

**It was him. Tall and thin, with a beard that touched his navel. His eyes, gray and fiery, seemed to glow. His hair fell below his waist. His fingernails were long, curved, almost unnatural.**

He didn’t speak, but I heard him inside my head: “Follow me.”

We walked deeper into the jungle. Eventually, he stopped at a crater-like opening in the ground. Its bottom wasn’t visible; just a deep, dark void. It looked like a black hole. Vast and Terrifying. I screamed, but the echo was too loud to bear.

Zimazari lit a torch and closed his eyes. My eyes shut on their own. Then I heard his voice inside my head again, chanting something in an unfamiliar language. The chant continued for nearly an hour. I felt the weight of my suffering slowly lift, as though it were leaking out of me.

When I opened my eyes, Zimazari threw the torch into the hole, and the crater sealed itself.

**“Leave this place now,”** I heard once more in my head. Then he vanished.

I ran through the forest, shaken but strangely at peace. For the first time in years, I felt free, like all my grief had been washed away.

I returned to Brazil, then back home. Everything felt fine. Better than fine. I was happy.

But not for long.

**A month later, I heard about a devastating volcanic eruption that claimed thousands of lives. At first, I ignored it. But something about it nagged at me.**

And then I remembered what Adrian had told me. After he met Zimazari, the 2004 tsunami happened. And now this eruption.

Something wasn’t right.

I called Adrian.

“David,” he said as soon as he answered. “I know why you’re calling. The volcano…”

“You knew?” I asked.

“David, you’re free now, aren’t you? But freedom always comes with a cost. You felt the ground shake, didn’t you? That wasn’t just you.""

“You never told me. I didn’t ask for this,” I said. “You may have become a monster, but I’m not. I know the tsunami was your fault. And now this… You became a healer just to atone for what you did.”

“David, I helped you,” he said, disturbingly calm.""
""I didn’t want to tell you, David. I couldn’t. After the tsunami… I swore I’d never send anyone else to him. But you were drowning.” he ended.

I couldn’t breathe. The weight of this truth was crushing.

“I don’t want to live with this,” I said. “It’s suffocating.”

“This is how you create another agony,” Adrian replied. “More painful than the ones you’ve endured. What’s done can’t be undone. Learn to live with it.”

**It was in that moment I realized: Zimazari's healing reaches the the earth's core, creating strong vibrations that trigger catastrophic disasters.**

And it meant time never betrayed me. It wasn’t the enemy. I was. Time’s scars may never fade, but trying to undo them might leave you with even deeper ones, from which the pus of regret forever oozes.

I've mostly been a lurker here but this subreddit has been a great place for motivation and tips.

I've never been active. Realized I need to fix this due to a health scare, so I have been going to the gym since march of last year, at the same weight. But also because all my pants kept breaking due to chaving, and I was not going to let that financially ruin me.

I've tried to be more conscious of food and focus on protein, but didn't give it my all in terms of calorie counting.

My weight has been stable for a year, I've definitely put on quite a bit of muscle (wide shoulders, large chest). So I've probably lost fat and gained muscle. 

On March 20th I started actually tracking my food by the gram, at 98kg.

I've done 1200kcal a day, some days 1500kcal, but not often. Mostly prioritizing on protein intake, which is over 100g per day. I found it very difficult to consistently get even more protein, but I guess it makes sense to only account for lean body weight, and I had a lot of fat, still do!

I know 1200 kcal is not much, but it's much easier mentally to do this for 3 months than 5.

Today a guy at the gym told me I look much leaner than before, and it's great that others have started noticing. I definitely feel much better and healthier, and pullups started to feel much easier! Not so afraid of the mirror anymore either.

I still had a pastry/protein bar or something good for myself in the morning most days. A cup of coffee (40 kcal from milk) and some 150-300 kcal carby snack to start my day, often timed right before the gym. Then planned the rest of my calories to fill up on protein.

...A lot of lean meat, quark, cottage cheese and greek yogurt has been consumed. I completely quit bread, pasta rice etc..  Sometimes relying too much on the cardboard tasting wasa cracker, which carried wherever protein I put on it.

I'm still doing this until the end of the month. Will probably still stay over 80kgs this summer, but oh well. Going to strive for eating mostly at maintenance (or slightly above) for a few months after this month, and then will most like do it again for a bit.

Miami is so diverse and very international. It doesn’t even feel like a city in Florida or the United States. When you are there it feels like you are in a different country. When we were walking down the street we heard different languages spoken more than English. I always knew that it’s a lot of Latinos in Miami but it’s not just Latinos. I seen Arabs, Indians, Ukrainians, Russians etc. I heard French and German as well. 

Miami has a great food scene!!! I’m not exaggerating when I say this. Everything we ate there was delicious. The first restaurant we went to we had pizza as an appetizer. I was born in Italy and spent years living in Italy so I have a high standard for pizza. The pizza was delicious!!!!!!! I was impressed. Then I had a braised short rib sandwich with aioli sauce for my main course. It was tasty!!!!! Another reason I say Miami feels like a city overseas is because all the restaurants we went to didn’t give you free refills. They gave you a can of coke and a glass with ice in it so you could pour it in. This is how it’s like in other countries outside of the United States. Of course we also went to the famous Versailles Cuban restaurant I tried the famous Cuban Sandwich and it was delicious. We also had the crème brûlée for dessert and it was very sweet and good. Then we got the Cuban coffee there!!!! I fell in love with the first sip!!!!! I would rank Cuban coffee up there with Italian coffee and again this is coming from a guy born in Italy. 

Midtown Miami is my favorite area of the city. It has such a good vibe and of course the women there are beautiful. It’s so many shops and nice restaurants in midtown Miami. Speaking of beautiful women and shops. We went to the Aventura Mall which is elegant and luxurious and has a good selection for clothes and has a great food court (I’ll get back to this later). Me and my brother went to this high end art store in the mall that was only open for a week. What caught my eye was the art made from Lamborghini and Ferrari engines and my brother liked the comic book art. Anyway another reason why we went is because one of the women working there was fine!!!! Luckily enough when we came in the store she talked to me and my brother. We had a good conversation with her and she said she’s born and raised in Miami and was telling us about the city and the art. There was Batman suit art piece made from the original Batman suit from the 1995 movie Batman Forever and it cost $288,000 🫣

Now to the food court of the Aventura mall. The food court is nice and has some great food selection. I had lamb shawarma and man it was tasty!!!!!! I was very impressed and I wish I had places like that where I live. There’s Mediterranean/middle eastern restaurants where I live but it was nowhere near as good as the lamb shawarma I had in Miami. I’m a car enthusiast and they had a Bentley on display in the mall, I was excited. You see so many Lamborghinis and Ferraris there. But the highlight was I saw a Bugatti Veyron!!!!!!! That’s a 3 million dollar car and extremely rare to see in person!!!!! I wonder what the woman driving it does for a living.

The only things I don’t like about Miami is the heat. I like cold weather so even though I love Miami I could never live there because it’s too hot for me. Secondly, the people there drive crazy and the roads are designed crazy as well. 

Overall, I love Miami and I think it’s a great city. It’s very diverse and international with a great food scene. I’ve read posts on this sub and people are mixed about Miami but I love it!!!!",1,1749652638.0,SameGrassButGreener,11,0.55,False

1l8u8cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/aliyah/comments/1l8u8cu/opinions_on_ulpan_and_language_learning_from/,Opinion's on Ulpan and language learning from someone who made Aliyah over a year ago,"I see alot of questions about Ulpan's here and just wanted to share some experiences I had:

I absolutely think it is of the utmost importance to learn the language. Prior to coming to Israel focus on VERBS and focus on PAST TENSE, FUTURE TENSE, and PRESENT TENSE for each verb.

* Prior to landing and moving into my new home; NBN assured me that they would arrange Ulpan for me. Not true. I had to go to my municipality for this information. My municipality offered NO ulpan so I had to look elsewhere. Still not impressed with NBN employees/organization to this day; not just because of this straight up misinformation they told me repeatedly. 
* I live in the center; but not in TA. I traveled to north TA for Ulpan at Ulpan Gordon for 5 months. Large class sizes. I personally was not impressed with Gordon. Every teacher I had seemed to favor Russian olim over English speakers. ALOT of the Russians I met were not Jewish and were openly Christian. They openly told me they faked their documents to escape the war and or someone a long time ago was Jewish but their parents and themselves were not Jewish. Many plan to go back home to Russia after the war.
* At Gordon I was going to class 4 days a week. This took me from Aleph to Alpeh+ to Bet. Gordon does not focus on speaking as much as they do grammar. 
* Again, I don't live in TA but I want to mention something strange I noticed about my fellow American olim who live in TA. Parts of TA are focused on tourism. They can get away with speaking English most of the time. Try that outside of TA. I never hear English and I use Hebrew every single day. Thing I found strange with TA olim is that when we would go out to eat; even though in the class they knew Hebrew.... they would not use it outside of class; they would instantly order in English at a restaurant or speak to people in English about their dogs etc... even not ordering a coffee in Hebrew... It's like they turned off Hebrew once they left the class? I just thought it strange. 
* I want to mention Big Brother. Famous trash reality tv show here. Watch it and read the captions. It helps big time. If you have family here like I do; go and visit them and spend time with them. This will help your Hebrew also. 
* I have heard of English only speaking communities; which I think are primarily for religious. I find that strange because you are here in Israel and should speak Hebrew to be integrated with everyone. 
* Lilienblum 7 is another Ulpan in TA that focuses more on speaking up until Bet +. Small class sizes. At Bet + level they focus primarily on reading and written Hebrew as in books and magazines etc. 
* I have interacted with some Israelis who realize that I speak English or am American and they want to shut me down and speak in English; I reverse uno and shut them down and force them to speak to me in Hebrew and or I only reply to them in Hebrew. 
* I met some American's who have been here for 6 years and still can't speak or read Hebrew.
* Pay and download the app Pealim. This is an AWESOME Hebrew verb app. 
* Remember there is more to Israel than just TA. 
* Everyone's language journey is different. I personally feel if you get to the Bet-Bet + level and you are using your Hebrew you may not even need to continue to a formal ulpan anymore. You can learn at your own at this point imo. At this point you know how the language works and all you need to study is more verbs and more vocabulary. 
* It's crazy; now my hearing and understanding is like crazy good. My writing is perfect and my reading is great but if there is a word I don't know well I don't know it. Always give yourself a chance to speak and meet people. Use what you learned.
*  You deserve a break after going to language school for such a long period of time. Absolutely; take a break but then get back to it. Don't lose it.
* I wish you all the best.

This is from a family member after advice, and although I've provided my opinion there are far more knowlegeable people than me:

I'm looking for some opinions on a difficult situation we're in with a builder and would appreciate any insights.

**Background**

We hired a local limited company (""Company A"") to build a garden office for a total contract price of around £25,000.

**The Key Events**

**1. The Contract & The Breach:** The written contract explicitly stated the office would be built on a ""fully insulated with a concrete finish"" base. Partway through the build, the company changed this to a timber base without any formal contract variation. We raised concerns but were told to trust their expertise.

**2. The Expert Witness Report:** The work was clearly substandard, with issues like patio flooding and damp in the new structure. We commissioned an independent RICS Chartered Surveyor to produce an expert witness report. The report was damning, concluding:

* The timber base is ""entirely defective"" with a predicted lifespan of ""less than five years"".
* The roof has no detectable fall and will result in ponding.
* The overall structure does not comply with Building Regulations.
* Estimated remediation cost is £10,000 - £12,000 + VAT

**3. The ""Phoenix"" Company:** While the dispute was ongoing, we noticed the directors had set up a new limited company (""Company B"") with an extremely similar name.

* Company B operates from the same premises, uses the same phone numbers, and has the same branding as Company A.
* Their Facebook page history shows they simply changed the name of the original page to the new company name.
* Evidence take over of Google reviews
* Redownloading our original contract and invoices from emails provides us with Company B branded documents with new business numbers etc.
* Takeover of Company A website, with references still to contact Company A

**4. The Directors' Conduct:**

* We have a recorded phone call where a director assured us the timber base they installed would last ""30 to 60 years"".
* We have voice notes where we were assured there would be no issues even in 20 years time
* We were instructed to, and did, pay the \~£20,000 for the project directly into one of the director's personal bank accounts, not a business account.
* Directors agreed to mediation and then delayed it, whilst resigning as directors of Company A and applying for voluntary strike off.
* Another third party also had litigation in progress against Company A, and won the judgement in March 2025. Company A currently has no directors and obviously is not paying the debt.

**The Pre-Action Process:**

* We sent a formal Letter Before Claim to Company A, Company B, and both directors personally.
* After this, we discovered they had applied to have Company A struck off from Companies House without informing us. We successfully objected, and the strike-off has been suspended.
* Both directors have since formally resigned from Company A (the original company).
* Their final response to us was to reject formal mediation (due to cost) and suggest an informal chat in a coffee shop to resolve the matter.

**Our Proposed Strategy & Question**

Our goal is to recover the costs to demolish and rebuild the structure correctly (new quotes are as high as £35k) or remediation costs (\~£15K). Our considered strategy is to issue a single court claim against all four parties:

Company A (The Original)

Company B (The ""Phoenix"")

Director 1 (Personally)

Director 2 (Personally)

We believe we have claims under Breach of Contract, Consumer Rights Act, Misrepresentation Act, CPUT Regulations, and the Insolvency Act (for transactions defrauding potential creditors).

The question to you guys is: Based on these facts, does our strategy of pursuing all four parties seem like the most effective way to maximise our chances of a successful financial recovery? Are there any other angles or risks we should be considering? i.e. Should we claim only against the companies/new company? They've effectively made the original company judgement proof.

**Summary of Key Evidence:**

* Written contract vs. photos of the actual build.
* A RICS Expert Witness Report.
* Recorded conversations containing clear misrepresentations.
* Bank statements showing payments to a personal account.
* Official Companies House records (strike-off application, director resignations).
* Screenshots of the company website and social media accounts proving the link between the two companies.
* Letter from Company B admitting it's formation ""...was simply to have a name change into a group company and was set up while your job was going on through our old company""
* A full correspondence trail showing their refusal to engage in formal mediation.

Spoiler: It's not just about how much you sleep.","# 🧠 Mental fatigue = your brain’s silent burnout

You sleep (mostly), you caffeinate (definitely), but somehow you still feel like your brain is running on 9% battery before noon?

Yeah, same. Welcome to the club of **modern mental burnout** — population: basically everyone.

Between the constant noise, never-ending decision-making, multitasking, 10 open tabs, group chats, emails, doomscrolling, and wondering what that one weird notification meant… our brains are fried. And we don’t even realize it.

# 🤯 How to know it’s mental fatigue (and not just “being tired”)

* You walk into a room and forget why.
* You read the same sentence 4 times.
* You open Instagram to relax and 45 minutes later you’re more anxious.
* Your 3rd coffee of the day feels like your only personality trait.

# 💀 What’s behind it?

Modern life.  
Information overload.  
Hyperconnectivity.  
Never switching off.  
Trying to be productive 24/7 because the internet told you so.

The result? Your brain is begging for a break. And we don’t mean sleep — we mean actual mental recovery.

# ✨ What actually helps (without quitting society or becoming a forest hermit)

Here are a few real things that helped me stop feeling like a walking zombie:

# 1. Micro-breaks that actually work

➡️ 5 minutes of deep breathing or doing *nothing* beats 30 minutes of passive scrolling.  
Real rest > mindless stimulation.

# 2. Give your brain the fuel it actually needs

Caffeine’s cool, but your brain also craves real nutrients.  
These supplements from [**vitaminonline.ch**](https://vitaminonline.ch) (Swiss-based, clean selection) can make a difference:

* 🧠 **Magnesium Bisglycinate** – for that constant wired-but-tired feeling
* 🌿 **Ashwagandha** – chill in capsule form
* 💊 **Vitamin B-Complex** – helps restore mental focus & energy levels



# 3. Turn. Off. Your. Phone.

Flight mode is a life hack. No one will die if you’re offline for 30 minutes. Your brain will actually thank you.

# 4. Eat like your brain matters

Not saying you have to become a nutrition saint.  
But adding things like:

* Omega-3s
* Leafy greens
* Nuts, seeds, and whole foods

…actually impacts how clearly you think and how fast you burn out.



# 🚀 TL;DR

You’re not weak. You’re just **mentally overloaded**.

And no, another espresso isn’t the solution.

The fix?  
✨ Better breaks  
✨ Smarter supplements  
✨ Fewer notifications  
✨ Less guilt about slowing down

Do we know if the kids are with her? It was dead quiet and she seemed abnormally happy.  Then she goes on to say that they are a lot on their vacation but quickly changed that to drinking. But not booze, more like Starbucks to get her coffee fix. She then confesses to a night of adult activities. She’s really trying hard to keep herself in check. She looks like she’s going to blow.",11,1749651875.0,d_rex1984snark,2,1.0,False
1l8u0fs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8u0fs,What kind of dripper is this?,"Hello community,

I got this dripper long time ago before I started to get into the specialty coffee rabbit hole. 

I have seen a lot of pouring techniques for Hairo V60 and stuff like that… However, I can observe that with this dripper I do not get the same brew time, I always brew slower than the recipes. 

Is this an actual V60 dripper? And if not, where can I get a proper recipe for this? Or should I forget about this one and get a Hairo VD-02T to brew better coffee?

Thanks in advance!
