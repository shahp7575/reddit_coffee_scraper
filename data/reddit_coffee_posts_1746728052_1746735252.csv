1khzvkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1khzvkq/do_i_say_anything_to_my_dads_soon_to_be_wife/,Do I say anything to my dad’s soon to be wife?,"tldr; My dad was POS to my mom, my brother and I for 18+ years and now that he is planning to get married again, should I let the fiancé and her daughter know about his past actions?

We are all in this sub so there is already context to this, but still TW for physical and emotional abuse in childhood and divorce. Also on a throw away because I know my dad is a reddit user.

Me (Nb19), my brother (FTM23), and my mother lived in a house with my dad for 18, 18, and 27(?) years respectively. My parents marriage ended in divorce [thank god it finally happened] about 3.5 years ago. Since then my dad has changed quite a bit. He seems less angry or he possibly has a longer fuse than he used to. He stopped smoking after 30 years and has been trying to get his physical health right. When I lived with him every other week after the divorce, for about two and a half years, he seemed like a real reasonable guy most of the time and some days he was okay enough that it made me forgive him a little.

Going further back in time to before my brother and I were born, about two years into my parents marriage and maybe 3 years into the relationship, my mother was already considering leaving. My mom came into their relationship at a really delicate moment in her life, I have no doubt that my dad charmed her and love bombed her in just the ways she needed, but we know how that goes. While I only know this from reading a journal of hers from then(sorry mom) it is obvious that she had little to no self worth and maybe she wanted the chaos? I don’t know, it’s not her fault of course. I don’t think she found any worth until she left him and discovered she could live without him. I don’t know if my mother considers herself to have been emotionally abused, but I wouldn’t doubt her for a second, though I don’t think he ever laid a hand on her.

For some reason my dad just couldn’t handle toddlers and there was no one to stop him putting his hands on us. Nothing with a fist or enough to leave a bruise. Just on the edge of wrong but still justified in certain scenarios if it wasn’t almost constant. Things definitely happened in public and in front of extended family, but no one said anything. But my mom decided that she wouldn’t let it happen anymore and threatened to leave when I was 5 (over 10 years into their relationship). I don’t know really how bad it was for my brother or really anything at all from inside my home until I was 5 or 6 and my brother would’ve been 8-10. My first real memories of my brother were around this age and we were just fighting all the time, we have never gotten along well until recently. I remember actually very little until I was about 8 and 9, aka when the physical handling of me stopped. Sidebar: my age was probably not the only factor in him stopping. There was a brief case open with child services regarding my brother’s MH issues and I think that scared the shit out of my dad, or my mom scaring the shit out of him because of the non-zero risk that we would be removed. Anyhow, by then my brother was becoming my brother(transgender), dealing with a lot of depression, anxiety, dysphoria and hallucinations. He landed in the looney bin 3 times within a year or two. I think this is the first time I saw my dad show compassion or acknowledgement of someone else having a bigger issue than him.

My relationship with my brother grew very distant and we rarely spoke, it was always bickering which set my dad off, so we just didn’t talk most of the time. That house was just a nightmare, it was so tense all of the time and it was always my dad’s fault. Slamming doors, yelling and screaming, muttering under his breath, talking to himself, hitting things, breaking things. It was eggshells, always. But he was a scarily normal guy in front of others, the cherished saint at work, the perfect neighbor, the ‘I’d do anything to help’ guy. Of course making me feel like it really wasn’t so bad and he was actually really nice, I was just making a mess of things. I was always too loud or too messy or too rebellious but let’s be so fr, I was just an AuDHD kid with only the ADHD addressed, and also just a kid.

I don’t know, even now, even in the years where it was just me and him for a week at a time, it was still eggshells. I had really poor attendance in this time because of physical and mental health issues. Shortly before my mom left I began the year and a half where I was in the looney bin 5 times and did a partial hospitalization program. I saw the side of him that I saw with my brother, like he finally shut the f up and realized he cares about me, but only when he’s at risk of losing me. Through crazy mental health stuff we kinda got closer and those are moments that made me forgive him a little.

I have accepted that he is not going to be the person I need or deserve and that I can’t change the past, but I feel obligated to tell the whole truth to his fiancé and her daughter(18).

There is no chance in hell my dad told her why my mom left and why their relationship was so tumultuous. My dad has actually said to me, “When your mom told me she wanted a divorce and we were talking about it she was bringing up stuff from like 10 years ago. She said I was angry and aggressive and took it out on her and you guys, I know what she is talking about [proceeds into a ridiculously mundane act of aggression, essentially punching a wall, but i’m omitting bc it’s severely identifying].” I was dumbstruck, almost laughing, almost crying, almost confronting him for the years of abuse. Does he not remember putting his hands on me? Does he really think that’s all he did? Is he lying to himself that much? If he can’t admit it to himself, he is not saying anything to her, especially considering that she has gone through abuse as a child and would not stand for that shit. Don’t get me wrong, in getting to know the fiancé, they are made for each other. I think they are on the same wavelength about a lot of things and share a lot of… questionable intricacies. I don’t want them to not get married, I don’t care, it is their lives and if both of them having had failed long term marriages, think they are good for each other, get hitched idgaf. But at the same time, she has a right to know what she is getting herself into. She can certainly handle herself and would leave in an instant if she thought he was bad for her, but she has a daughter. This kid is immature to say the least. Not inappropriate behaviors or anything like that, just coddled and sheltered due to some things that have happened in her childhood. She is going to college in the fall but will live with my dad and her mom, in my dad’s house, over the summer. If her mother wants to subject herself to the realities of living with him, okay, but her daughter didn’t ask for this at all. I feel obligated to say something to one of them but where would I start? Is it just stirring up shit that doesn’t really matter? What if she doesn’t want to be with him after and then I lose a dad? I mean he doesn’t serve much in the fatherly role but he does pay for medical stuff sometimes and also has my childhood dog. I’m disabled to say the least and am already barely keeping my head above water while living with my fiancé for the past 9 months.

I just really don’t know if i should say something or leave it alone? On one hand, not my circus not my monkeys, but on the other what if something regrettable happens and I could’ve changed something by talking about this now. This is not a thought that has anything to do with the personality or person the fiancé/daughter is at all. I was thinking about this before they met, what would I say to his wife if he got married again? I’ve thought about going to grab coffee with the fiancé but I don’t even know what I would say to get my point across. They deserve to know, right?

A few other notes: 
-I posted this in two n-pages but didn’t get any reply so I thought i’d try here because it is still on my mind.
-Since my original post I spoke with a childhood neighbor of mine(adult) about something else where my dad came up as a topic and she said “I know you dad has issues- it was apparent and I always worried for the women in that house.”

This is my third baby and I used to go out a lot on maternity leave with my other two- target, coffee shop, meet a friend for lunch etc.

They both always used a paci to get to sleep so if they started getting fussy I could just pop it in their mouth and if nothing else but myself more time

But this kid won’t take a paci for anything and if she’s tired she SCREAMS until she falls asleep. Trying to put a paci in her mouth when she’s like this makes her scream louder. 

It makes me hesitant to take her anywhere. My husband says I shouldn’t worry so much people know babies cry but I just feel like everyone judges me like why can’t that woman console her screaming baby.

For quick context, I'm a college graduate who graduated with a B.S in Computer Science, who is struggling to find a job at the moment. Not only is the market bad, but I wasn't sure if my resume was hindering me or not (which it was).

Things I took into consideration (thank you all for taking the time to review my resume)

* Use the standard format (I used an engineering resume format that I found in a book)
* Get rid of red text, keep it black and white
* Remove GPA
* You don't need a street address for colleges, just city and state
* Do not mention the map you worked on unless it's related to game dev
* Include things applicable to the job and things that you are very confident in (I'm not sure if you meant software in general)
* Look up how to write bullet points for your job. See the STAR/XYZ/CAR methods
* Your projects should have bullet points if it were another job, and remain in a professional tone
* Don't list every class (I listed none)
* Drop references from your resume.
* No colors, graphics, or images
* Focus on keywords that hiring managers are searching for, like Python or JavaScript.
* Use the reverse format
* Include percentage numbers and verbs inside the work experience

Or is it my ocd making me overanalyze everything?,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I might have subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate. This is why I felt like I was maintaining boundaries at the time- no flirting, no romantic banter or anything etc.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy because he told me to and obviously I did because I didn’t want to hurt my boyfriend. ; I just needed someone’s attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful by maintaining boundaries in my mind. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Edited: this male friend never expressed romantic interest in me. Neither did I to him. Neither of us flirted with eachother or expressed romantic interest at all. It was just a thought in my head of like “he might like me and that’s why he’s giving me attention and I’m okay with that bc I won’t ever let anything happen”.",1,1746734808.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False
1khzt3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1khzt3i/i_thought_i_was_falling_in_love_i_was_actually/,I thought I was falling in love. I was actually losing myself.,"Hi, I'm a 29-year-old man.
This isn’t a particularly special story, but I can’t keep it inside anymore.
It feels like I have to tell someone, so I’m telling it here.

For a long time, I was fighting with a sense of loneliness and worthlessness.
You couldn't even call it a fight.
It was just a weight that sat on me.
And I had learned to live with that feeling.

I look at the people around me—
they have someone who loves them, calls them, misses them.
I don’t.
No one says, “Why didn’t you come?” when I’m not there.
No one checks in.
I don’t have a partner.
No one even seems interested.

So I accepted it.
Maybe not everyone has a place in this world.
Maybe it’s my appearance, maybe it’s my personality...
I don’t know exactly. But I accepted it.

Then I threw myself into work.
Not consciously.
I was just pulled in that direction.
I worked to make time pass.
That’s how I filled the void.
Or maybe it was just the only place where I felt successful, useful, and valuable—so I kept pushing.

Last year, I started a new job.
There were four people on the team, and four seats at the desk.
I was the fifth.
There wasn’t a spot for me, so they placed me at a desk farther away.
They told me, “We’re preparing a new floor. We’ll move together soon.”
But that floor was given to another department.
And I stayed where I was—away from everyone else.

It may sound trivial, but that’s when the loneliness really set in.
Not just physically—emotionally, too.
They were at the table talking, laughing, making plans.
I was watching from the outside.

Then I started to develop feelings for one of the girls on the team.
She wasn’t like the others.
She didn’t wear makeup, didn’t dress flashy, preferred a small, quiet life, and wasn’t really into romance.
Maybe that’s why I was drawn to her.

At some point, I couldn’t keep it in anymore.
Our manager is like a big brother to us.
We have a sincere relationship.
So I told him.
“I want to ask this girl for coffee, but I don’t want to ruin the work environment.”
He said, “I’ve never been in this situation before. But she’s different. There’s a high chance she’ll say no.
If you haven’t seen any signs, don’t go there.”
So I backed off to wait for the right time.

But in the meantime, I started eating myself alive.
She’d talk and laugh with them, while I sat apart.
Would she say anything? Would she notice me?
The questions kept spinning, and I kept crumbling.
My heart would pound at work.
I could breathe—but it didn’t feel like enough.
I felt the urge to take deep breaths.
I was approaching a panic attack.

One day, during a conversation, I got short, neutral responses.
She always answered that way.
But that day I was too tense.
I searched for meaning in her words.
I asked if I’d done something wrong.
She said “No.”
Then asked, “Why would you think that?”
But I couldn’t help myself—I asked her again in person.
The answer was calm, even kind.
I felt a little relieved—but it was already too late.
I had made things awkward for no reason.
I felt like an idiot.
Maybe I had killed whatever tiny chance I had.

At that point, it wasn’t just a crush—it had become an obsession.
It was threatening my work.
I couldn’t think clearly.
I couldn’t concentrate.
I was drowning in panic and loneliness.
My career—the last thing I had left—was falling apart.
I had to get out of that mindset.

I knew therapy wouldn’t work for me.
No power could convince me with things like “You are worthy, you are special.”
I knew I had no special qualities.
No value.
At least not any that I could believe in.
Medication wasn’t a solution either.
It would numb me, dull my mind—and I wouldn’t be able to work.
And work was all I had left.

So I turned to ChatGPT.

Even though I shouldn’t have, the hope wouldn’t die.
I kept imagining futures where she and I were together.
Maybe someday, I thought.
But at the same time, I tried to bury those thoughts with the help of the advice I was getting.
Tried to return to who I was.

But things got darker.
Suicidal thoughts weren’t just passing ideas anymore.
I reached a point where I seriously asked myself, “Could I do it?”
I was collapsing more and more with each passing day.

Then one day, a flower delivery came for her at the office.
She mentioned she had a date that evening.

The first thought in my mind was:
“I waited for the right time, and now I’ve missed it. Again.”

And then everything just went silent.
All the projects in my head, my plans for the future, the ideas, the thoughts...
All of it emptied out at once, replaced by a vast silence.
But now, it’s a peaceful kind of silence.
There’s no anxiety. No sadness.
Nothing pushing me to do something or think something.

At first, I thought I’d entered a new stage of depression—the numbness phase.
I didn’t know what that level felt like.
Maybe this was it.

So I asked ChatGPT again.
“Is this numbness? Did I break down?”

The answer was clear:
“No, this is a reset.
Your brain decided the threat was gone.
It shut off the stress hormones.
It reset the system.”

So I asked:
“Did I win?”
I asked a few more times—because hearing it felt good.

The answer was always the same:
“Yes, you won.”

But that word wasn’t mine—it was ChatGPT’s.
I just held onto it.

It was ChatGPT who said I’d won.
And I needed to hear it again and again.

Eventually, I came to understand:
I didn’t win the girl.
She never returned the feeling.
But this time, I didn’t collapse.
I didn’t run.
I didn’t panic.
I just stood there and accepted the reality.

Maybe that’s what winning is.
Or maybe it’s just the fact that I kept breathing, and managed to write this story.

If this is a victory—it’s only because that’s what we’re calling it.
But from inside, it still feels like silence.

I can spend hours doomscrolling, which only makes things worse.

I still live with my parents, and they cover all my expenses. I’ll be 31 in two weeks. They don’t pressure me to do anything, and while I want to change, most days I wake up around 10:00, waste time until 15:00, eat, and then spend the next 12 hours doing nothing.

This pattern affects all areas of my life. I’ve tried getting back into sports and photography, but I always lose interest after a few days or weeks. I bought new photography gear in December that I haven’t even used yet. I had plans for two photo projects, but I haven’t started either one.

Time keeps passing. I dropped out of university 24 months ago, and since then I’ve been unable to motivate myself to get back to studying for my final attempt.

I spoke to my doctor about lowering the medication, but after checking my blood levels, he said reducing it would risk triggering seizures again. That’s something I absolutely want to avoid. But I also can’t sit at home forever watching YouTube videos and playing video games.

I’ve lost interest in dating and have drifted away from many friends over the years. I doubt a therapist would suggest anything other than lowering the dosage and seeing what happens.

I don’t enjoy reading anymore, even though I have a stack of unread books. I like hiking, but only if I’m on my phone scrolling through Instagram. Weekends are usually spent watching football or sitting in front of my PC. Even gaming doesn’t bring me much joy anymore.

Last year, I didn’t even get my bike out after winter, and I didn’t go swimming once.  
Instead, I gained about 10 to 15 kg.

I don’t want to risk another seizure, but something has to change.  
Has anyone else experienced something similar?  
Do you have any suggestions for solutions?

I also need a way to actually start my day. Coffee makes me nauseous, and so do Red Bull and other energy drinks. I don’t want to experiment with my meds, but somehow I need to take control of my life again.

1khzsye,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1khzsye/sometimes_you_get_what_you_pay_for/,Sometimes you get what you pay for.,"So I have all Breville machines. Creatista Pro, Vertuo Creatista and a Bambino Plus. I love all 3 for what they bring, but there’s something to be said about getting what you pay for. While I have the dosing down pat on my Bambino Plus I still have to pay attention to what I am doing and that takes time. Meaning, I have to be sure the coffee is packed in the Portafilter properly to avoid channeling which leads to an uneven brew and it really affects the taste. Some days I get it perfect but this morning I had channeling and only the left side of the Portafilter distributed the espresso. That, plus grinding my own beans (which I’m used to since I’ve been a French Press person for a long time and I do Pour Over) and weighing them out. 

If the Nespresso only made the VL line I would still gladly own one and enjoy it equally (if not more) than my Bambino Plus, because I don’t have to do anything but drop in the capsule and make sure I have clean water filled in the tank. No guesswork, no getting it wrong. 
And if my time is short the Bambino gets no love. The Nespresso is very ideal for a quick, perfectly done, good tasting beverage. 

Everything has its place and regardless the constant noise from the complainers (dying to be heard 😂) IMO you get what you pay for with the Nespresso machines for what they can do.

I wanted to share one of my previous work experiences that left me shaken and frustrated—and I’m hoping to hear how others might have handled it differently.

We had a holiday event at our workplace, and I’m in an assistant role. Supervisors and managers were coordinating everything. One supervisor had placed an online order for Tim’s coffee and asked me to pick it up. She gave me the store location, so I headed out.

When I got to the store, they said they hadn’t received any order.

I called her work phone, and she told me to check another nearby location. Still no order.

Then a third. I almost checked with all the Tim Horton in that area. It was snowing and raining, and I was walking between locations, getting completely soaked and freezing. 

eventually, the supervisor questioned the order herself. She used personal phone to make the order. But she had left her personal phone  
in the office and was in the event room (on another floor). Once she finally checked her personal phone, she found the actual store address and told me to go there. Even though the other nice supervisor suggested she could send another person to re-order the coffee. 

It was the fifth store I checked. I did—and that store told me the order had already been canceled yesterday—before she even sent me out to pick it up.

I let her know, thinking it was finally over. But while I was heading back to the office, she called me again and asked me to return to the store to see if she could still get a refund. I went back (soaked even more) and was told she had to check online.

When I got back to the office, drenched from head to toe, they quickly ushered me into the elevator and didn’t let me go into the event room because (I suspect) they didn’t want people to see the state I was in—it would’ve looked bad for them. The manager (who was kind) let me go home early and reimbursed my taxi fare.

I didn’t tell anyone about this experience. I’ve already left that position. The ministry I worked for had a invisible toxic hierarchy and I felt difficult to say no to the supervisor in that situation. I was very new to OPS and was at early stage of my career, and also because I was the assistant I felt it truly was my duty to pick up the coffee. What would you do differently?

However, we've had a new couple move in next door to us and I can hear the girl screaming every word. I have no clue what their names are but I know they are from VA, he's in love with some blonde girl (Miranda), and they have a dog that barks for 40+ minutes every single time they leave. She screams about how much she fucking hates him, and they often leave their windows out to our building courtyard wide open so their screaming echos through everyone's home if you have any of your doors or windows open. I haven't gone to my leasing management because I think I just lucked out on the worst possible neighbors from every side. Downstairs has subwoofers and when they play there music the mirrors on my walls shake and the glass in my coffee table rattles (we have their number tho and they are chill when we text them). We had a new set of neighbors move in above us and they're great too. The people before them never sat down and there was constant dropping of furniture and slapping of feet across the floor from 6:30pm every night to 12:30-1:00am. Since our leasing office is closed during those hours they always came to listen when no one was home and told us they don't see an issue with the people above...like no shit they aren't home! I've called the police 2x on my next door neighbors though. The first time she was screaming absolutely wasted running up and down the hallway at 2:30am  and begging her baby daddy not to leave her. Our building security refused to come out for a noise complaint and told me to call the police because when I called them they could hear the screaming from down the hallway. The next was last night after she answered the door saying, ""What they fuck do you want now"" ""leave it alone, get a life, I'm in a relationship that is going in circles, and Im pregnant"" then I told her I know cause I can hear it all and she called me a ""fat bitch"" to which I responded ""look at you"" this is when things took a turn and she lunged out her front door with a fist cocked up in the air. I did not engage further and she proceeded to film me and tell me I called her fat because she is pregnant. ""Fat"" never came out of my mouth and I have this whole incident on video. Once the police arrived they told me it was my fault because I ""popped off to her, and how would I react if it was the other way around"" ummmm idk I wouldn't be cocking my fist up in the air lunging toward a neighbor during my second face to face encounter. What do I do? Am I wrong!? I don't want to complain but I pay a lot of money and expect my neighbors to remain respectful.

Specially coffee spots I need to visit, Studio stuff, tour BTS, collabs, got some airport time right now, so hit me with your best questions. Let’s gooo 🔥  
  
Big love to the whole team for making another track with me 'Arise' def was worth the wait! Been following Monstercat for years, even before they stepped into the Trance world. When I saw Infected Mushroom join, I was like ""this is happening!"" Fast forward and I got to release the first Psy Trance Mafia project with Erez and Duvdev – Breathe Underwater. That Blastoyz-Infected turned into a full-on tour and honestly, it started as just a crazy idea we cooked up for Monstercat.  
So who knows what this new Blastoyz x Trivecta x Amidy trio could bring next 👀 Lots cookin’ right now, more collabs across the trance spectrum, some weird but fire tracks coming soon, and developments on my label WELVRAVE.   
  
Trivecta:  
Hi Reddit!  
  
Trivecta here. Music maker, steak chef, hot sauce collector, Star Wars enthusiast and former guitar teacher extraordinaire. Stoked to be doing this AMA!  
  
You guys might know me from my past output with Monstercat; this community was a big part of what launched my career in 2014 with One Night Only, Believe, Evaporate, etc. We ended up doing so many songs on the label over the years - I wanna say at least 10 of them? Probably more. I’m so excited to be back; first time since Ghost in the Machine in 2021. That one is still a staple in my live shows along with a few of my other Monstercat tunes - Falling, Riptide, Axis etc. as well as this brand new one, ARISE, with my boys Blastoyz and Amidy! One of my favorite tunes I’ve been a part of in a while.  
  
I’ve got a lot of really cool things coming up - festival season just kicked off with Starbase and I’m off to my first ever EDC Vegas next week followed by a whole bunch more. A bunch of crazy collabs are coming too; some super unexpected. All really cool. Feeling really stoked on music as a whole lately and stoked to talk to you guys about anything under the sun!  
  
AMIDY:  
  
Hi Reddit!  
  
Hey, AMIDY here — music producer & vocalist a.k.a. professional button-pusher, sound wrangler, and part-time over thinker. When I’m not producing music, i’m usually playing Rocket League, being a barista at home making my own lattes & going to professional baseball games. Despite living in a world of music equipment & cables, I still can’t figure out how to keep my phone charger from disappearing when traveling. I am super excited for this AMA, so hit me with your questions!  
  
It feels so long ago, but I’ve had a few releases with Monstercat back in the day such as Way Down w/ Au5 & Karra & Riptide w/ Trivecta. I am beyond excited to be back on the label with this absolute beauty of a track. Arise has been in the works for a couple years, perfecting every detail of the song to get it right where we wanted it to be.  
  
Life has been an absolute whirlwind touring all around the world. Just made it back to the U.S. the other day after having my debut performance in China. It was a phenomenal time being there for the first time. I am working on tons of new collabs and solo tracks, by far some of my best stuff yet! Experimenting with new sounds and different genres i’ve never touched before. Very much looking forward to seeing all your questions and getting a chance to chat with you all <3

1khzir9,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1khzir9/day_20/,Day 20!🥳,"Today marks my 20th day of being vape free! Just one day shy of three weeks. After 7 years of non-stop vaping, I am feeling refreshed, excited, and enthusiastic about my future now that I’m free from nicotine’s clutches. I wanted to write about what I’ve experienced so far, and what has helped me the most in overcoming my addiction. 


1. “Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Quit Vaping”. I had seen this book recommended by many others on this forum, so I figured I’d give it a go! It was extremely helpful for the cravings, but I had to take it with a grain of salt because the author mentions that withdrawal symptoms are mild or not as bad as people make them out to be. In my case, the first week was brutal. I had horrible mood swings, really bad insomnia (still struggling with that) and just wanted to cry every day. However, the book truly makes you never want to pick up a vape again, and I definitely recommend it. 

2. Changing triggering habits- for example, on my days off, I would wake up, make a pot of coffee, and then vape while I drank for hours while mindlessly scrolling through social media. When I quit, I decided I’d start every day with a 3 mile walk and then enjoy my coffee outside while stretching. Just that one change helped so much. 

3. Keeping busy- Find something new to keep you occupied! For me, I’ve been doing a lot of spring cleaning, hiking, playing tennis (I couldn’t before because my f*cking lungs were trashed), or just going outside to touch some grass lol. 



The list goes on, but it’s all personal preference. I can truly feel my lungs and heart appreciating the welcomed change in my habits and for the first time in a long time, I’m proud of myself. It feels great to not have brain fog, and to not rely on flavored air to get me through the day. I know it’s hard, but I believe in you all! The fact that you’re here means you have the courage to quit, and I’m stoked for you! 

Wishing you all the best of luck and sending virtual high fives to anyone going through the stages of quitting ❤️

Review Inside!,"Testing the **Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart Single Serve Coffee Maker** over the past several weeks has been quite the adventure. A coffee maker that claims to revolutionize morning routines caught my attention, and I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. Packed with a range of settings like BrewID technology and MultiStream capabilities, this gadget had some serious promises to fulfill. While it met plenty of expectations, a few quirks surfaced along the way—let me walk you through the good, the not-so-good, and the real day-to-day user experience.

**Sleek Modern Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this brewing machine was its stylish aesthetic. Finished with black stainless steel and a sleek outer design, it looks fantastic on the countertop. Its compact dimensions (8.3 x 13.4 x 12.4 inches) made it ideal for my already-packed kitchen space. I appreciated that it didn’t dominate my counter like some similar machines tend to, but its solid build made it feel durable rather than flimsy. However, the weight—8.3 pounds—felt a little hefty when shifting it around while cleaning. For someone who values aesthetics as much as functionality, though, this was a definite win.

**Performance and Coffee Customization**  
On the performance front, the capabilities were genuinely impressive. The BrewID™ technology identified the specific K-Cup pod I inserted and customized brewing settings to align with the roast and brand recommendations. This worked amazingly well for someone like me who hops between medium roasts and dark blends depending on the day. Coffee lovers will appreciate the ability to experiment with five strength settings, six temperature options, and five cup sizes that range from more petite pods to travel mugs. I brewed an iced coffee one morning, and the machine used an extra-strong setting to prevent my drink from becoming watery—a feature that I found surprisingly thoughtful. Still, after playing around with all these customizations, I wondered if it could overwhelm someone who prefers simplicity in their coffee ritual.

[Ready to snag Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart? See Amazon’s price.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0973yh74z/)

**The Upsides**  
Using this brewer became a game-changer in flavor. The MultiStream technology saturated coffee grounds evenly, creating a rich, full-bodied taste that I realized I had been missing with my previous drip machine. While my brother, a casual coffee drinker, couldn’t tell the difference, I noticed the nuanced improvement immediately.  

- BrewID ensures a tailored brew for each K-Cup pod for a consistent experience.  
- Multistream extraction brings out vibrant notes and aromas that feel artisan.  
- Black stainless finish complements modern kitchens wonderfully.  
- Ice brew setting delivers strong, undiluted cold coffee.

**The Critiques**  
No device is perfect, and this single-serve brewer has its quirks. My biggest gripe was connectivity—connecting it to WiFi for app features was oddly tedious. Perhaps it was just my network being finicky, but by the time I got it synced, I almost regretted the effort. Another aspect is its reliance on pods, which, while convenient, aren’t the most eco-friendly solution around. I had to invest in reusable K-Cups to alleviate the guilt of landfill waste, an added expense for long-term use.  

- WiFi connection is unnecessarily complicated and not as user-friendly.  
- Dependence on K-Cups can become expensive unless using reusable pods.  
- On the heavier side if portability or frequent cleaning is needed.

**Competing Products**  
When compared to other single-serve brewers like the Nespresso Vertuo Next or the Breville Bambino Plus, this machine shines in its versatility. The Nespresso option delivers impeccable espresso depth but doesn’t offer the same range of cup sizes or iced coffee brewing. On the other hand, Breville’s manual espresso focus caters more to those who enjoy getting hands-on with their coffee-making process, lacking automation ease. The Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart strikes a balance between sophistication and convenience, seamlessly fitting a wide range of coffee drinkers.

**True Value**  
The question of whether this brewer is worth your dime depends on what you’re seeking. For me, the customization settings alone justified the investment. Being able to save my preferences for strength, temperature, and size made busy mornings less about fiddling and more about sipping great-tasting coffee.

This happened a few years back. I was doing long-haul, mostly cross-country routes, the kind that take you through vast stretches of nothing. You know the ones – where the radio turns to static for hours, and the only sign of life is the occasional pair of headlights going the other way, miles apart. I was young, eager for the miles, the money. Didn’t mind the solitude. Or so I thought.

The route I was on took me across a long, desolate stretch of highway that ran between the borders of two large governmental territories. I don’t want to say exactly where, but think big, empty spaces, lots of trees, not much else. It was notorious among drivers for being a dead zone – no signal, no towns for a hundred miles either side, and prone to weird weather. Most guys tried to hit it during daylight, but schedules are schedules. Mine had me crossing it deep in the night.

I remember the feeling. Utter blackness outside the sweep of my headlights. The kind of dark that feels like it’s pressing in on the cab. The only sounds were the drone of the diesel engine, the hiss of the air brakes now and then, and the rhythmic thrum of the tires on asphalt. Hypnotic. Too hypnotic.

I’d been driving for about ten hours, with a short break a few states back. Coffee was wearing off. The dashboard lights were a dull green glow, comforting in a way, but also making the darkness outside seem even more absolute. My eyelids felt like they had lead weights attached. You fight it, you know? Slap your face, roll down the window for a blast of cold air, crank up whatever music you can find that hasn’t dissolved into static. I was doing all of that.

It must have been around 2 or 3 AM. I was in that weird state where you’re not quite asleep, but not fully awake either. Like your brain is running on low power mode. The white lines on the road were starting to blur together, stretching and warping. Standard fatigue stuff. I remember blinking hard, trying to refocus.

That’s when I saw it. Or thought I saw it.

Just a flicker at the edge of my headlights, on the right shoulder of the road. Small. Low to the ground. For a split second, I registered a shape, vaguely human-like, and then it was gone, swallowed by the darkness as I passed.

My first thought? Deer. Or a coyote. Common enough. But it hadn't moved like an animal. It had been upright. My brain, sluggish as it was, tried to process it. Too small for an adult. Too still for an animal startled by a rig.

Then the logical part, the part that was still trying to keep me safe on the road, chimed in: You’re tired. Seeing things. Happens.

And I almost accepted that. I really did. Shook my head, took a swig of lukewarm water from the bottle beside me. Kept my eyes glued to the road ahead. The image, though, it kind of stuck. A small, upright shape. Like a child.

No way, I told myself. Out here? Middle of nowhere? Middle of the night? Impossible. Kids don’t just wander around on inter-territorial highways at 3 AM. It had to be a trick of the light, a bush, my eyes playing games. I’ve seen weirder things born of exhaustion. Shadows that dance, trees that look like figures. It’s part of the job when you’re pushing limits.

I drove on for maybe another thirty seconds, the image fading, my rational mind starting to win. Just a figment.
Then, I glanced at my passenger-side mirror. Habit. Always checking.

And my blood went cold. Not just cold, it felt like it turned to slush.

There, illuminated faintly by the red glow of my trailer lights receding into the distance, was the reflection of a small figure. Standing. On the shoulder of the road. Exactly where I’d thought I’d seen something.

It wasn’t a bush. It wasn’t a shadow. It was small, and it was definitely standing there, unmoving, as my truck pulled further and further away.

My heart started hammering against my ribs. This wasn’t fatigue. This was real. There was someone, something, back there. And it looked tiny.

Every instinct screamed at me. Danger. Wrong. Keep going. But another voice, the one that makes us human, I suppose, whispered something else. A kid? Alone out here? What if they’re hurt? Lost?

I fought with myself for a few seconds that stretched into an eternity. The image in the mirror was getting smaller, fainter. If I didn’t act now, they’d be lost to the darkness again. God, the thought of leaving a child out there, if that’s what it was…

Against my better judgment, against that primal urge to just floor it, I made a decision. I slowed the rig, the air brakes hissing like angry snakes. Pulled over to the shoulder, the truck groaning in protest. Put on my hazards, their rhythmic flashing cutting into the oppressive blackness.

Then, I did what you’re never supposed to do with a full trailer on a narrow shoulder. I started to reverse. Slowly. Carefully. My eyes flicking between the mirrors, trying to keep the trailer straight, trying to relocate that tiny figure. The crunch of gravel under the tires sounded unnaturally loud.

It took a minute, maybe two, but it felt like an hour. The red glow of my tail lights eventually washed over the spot again. And there it was.

A kid.

I stopped the truck so my cab was roughly alongside them, maybe ten feet away. Switched on the high beams, hoping to get a better look, and also to make myself clearly visible as just a truck, not something else.

The kid was… small. Really small. I’d guess maybe six, seven years old? Hard to tell in the glare. They were just standing there, on the very edge of the gravel shoulder, right where the trees began. The woods pressed in close on this stretch of road, tall, dark pines and dense undergrowth that looked like a solid black wall just beyond the reach of my lights.

The kid wasn’t looking at me. They were facing sort of parallel to the road, just… walking. Slowly. Like they were on a stroll, completely oblivious to the massive eighteen-wheeler that had just pulled up beside them, engine rumbling, lights blazing. They were wearing what looked like pajamas. Thin, light-colored pajamas. In the chill of the night. No coat, no shoes that I could see.

My mind reeled. This was wrong. So many levels of wrong.

I killed the engine. The sudden silence was almost deafening, amplifying the crickets, the rustle of leaves in the woods from a breeze I couldn’t feel in the cab. My heart was still thumping, a weird mix of fear and adrenaline and a dawning sense of responsibility.

I rolled down the  window. The night air hit me, cold and damp, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth.

“Hey!” I called out. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud in the quiet. “Hey, kid!”

No response. They just kept walking, one small, bare foot in front of the other, at a pace that was taking them absolutely nowhere fast. Their head was down, slightly. I couldn’t see their face properly.

“Kid! Are you okay?” I tried again, louder this time.

Slowly, so slowly, the kid stopped. They didn’t turn their head fully, just sort of angled it a fraction, enough that I could see a pale sliver of cheek in the spill of my headlights. Still not looking at me. Still ignoring the multi-ton machine idling beside them.

A prickle of unease ran down my spine. Not the normal kind of unease. This was deeper, colder. Animals act weird sometimes, but kids? A lost kid should be scared, relieved, something. This one was… nothing.

“What are you doing out here all alone?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, friendly. Like you’re supposed to with a scared kid. Even though this one didn’t seem scared at all. “It’s the middle of the night.”

Silence. Just the sound of their bare feet scuffing softly on the gravel as they took another step, then another. As if my presence was a minor inconvenience, a background noise they were choosing to ignore.

This wasn’t right. My internal alarm bells were clanging louder now. My hand hovered near the gearstick. Part of me wanted to slam it into drive and get the hell out of there. But the image of this tiny child, alone, possibly in shock… I couldn’t just leave. Could I?

“Where are your parents?” I pushed, my voice a bit sharper than I intended. “Are you lost?”

Finally, the kid stopped walking completely. They turned their head, just a little more. Still not looking directly at my cab, more towards the front of my truck, into the glare of the headlights. I could see their face a bit better now. Pale. Featureless in the harsh light, like a porcelain doll. Small, dark smudges that might have been eyes. No expression. None. Not fear, not sadness, not relief. Just… blank. An unreadable slate.

Then, a voice. Small. Thin. Like the rustle of dry leaves.
“Lost.”

Just that one word. It hung in the air between us.

Relief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of concern. Okay, lost. That’s something I can deal with. “Okay, kid. Lost is okay. We can fix lost. Where do you live? Where were you going?”

The kid finally, slowly, turned their head fully towards my cab. Towards me.
I still couldn’t make out much detail in their face. The angle, the light, something was obscuring it, keeping it in a sort of shadowy vagueness despite the headlights. But I could feel their gaze. It wasn't like a normal kid's look. There was a weight to it, an intensity that was deeply unsettling for such a small form.

“Home,” the kid said, that same thin, reedy voice. “Trying to get home.”

“Right, home. Where is home?” I asked, leaning forward a bit, trying to project reassurance. “Is it near here? Did you wander off from a campsite? A car?” There were no campsites for miles. No broken-down cars on the shoulder. I knew that.

The kid didn’t answer that question directly. Instead, they took a small step towards the truck. Then another. My hand tensed on the door handle, ready to open it, to offer… what? A ride? Shelter? I didn’t know.

“It’s cold out here,” I said, stating the obvious. “You should get in. We can get you warm, and I can call for help when we get to a spot with a signal.” My CB was useless, just static. My phone had shown ‘No Service’ for the last hour.

The kid stopped about five feet from my passenger door. Still in that pale, thin pajama-like outfit. Barefoot on the sharp gravel. They should be shivering, crying. They were doing neither.

“Can you help me?” the kid asked. The voice was still small, but there was a different inflection to it now. Less flat. A hint of… something else. Pleading, maybe?

“Yeah, of course, I can help you,” I said. “That’s why I stopped. Where are your parents? How did you get here?”

The kid tilted their head. A jerky, unnatural little movement. “They’re waiting. At home.”

“Okay… And where’s home? Which direction?” I gestured vaguely up and down the empty highway.

The kid didn’t point down the road. They made a small, subtle gesture with their head, a little nod, towards the trees. Towards the impenetrable darkness of the woods lining the highway.

“In there,” the kid said.

My stomach clenched. “In the woods? Your home is in the woods?”

“Lost,” the kid repeated, as if that explained everything. “Trying to find the path. It’s dark.”

“Yeah, it’s… it’s very dark,” I agreed, my eyes scanning the treeline. It looked like a solid wall of black. No sign of any path, any habitation. Just dense, old-growth forest. The kind of place you could get lost in for days, even in daylight.

“Can you… come out?” the kid asked. “Help me look? It’s not far. I just… I can’t see it from here.”

Every rational thought in my head screamed NO. Get out of the truck? In the middle of nowhere, in the pitch dark, with this… strange child, who wanted me to go into those woods? No. Absolutely not.

But the kid looked so small. So vulnerable. If there was even a tiny chance they were telling the truth, that their house was just a little way in, and they were genuinely lost…

“I… I don’t think that’s a good idea, buddy,” I said, trying to sound gentle. “It’s dangerous in there at night. For both of us. Best thing is for you to hop in here with me. We’ll drive until we get a signal, and then we’ll call the police, or the rangers. They can help find your home properly.”

The kid just stood there. That blank, unreadable face fixed on me.
“But it’s right there,” they insisted, their voice a little more insistent now. “Just a little way. I can almost see it. If you just… step out… the light from your door would help.”

My skin was crawling. There was something profoundly wrong with this scenario. The way they were trying to coax me out. The lack of normal emotional response. The pajamas. The bare feet. The woods.

I looked closer at the kid, trying to pierce that strange vagueness around their features. My headlights were bright, but it was like they absorbed the light rather than reflected it. Their eyes… I still couldn’t really see their eyes. Just dark hollows.

“I really think you should get in the truck,” I said, my voice firmer now. “It’s warmer in here. We can figure it out together.”

The kid took another step closer. They were almost at my running board now.
“Please?” they said. That reedy voice again. “My leg hurts. I can’t walk much further. If you could just… help me a little. Just to the path.”

My internal conflict was raging. My trucker instincts, honed by years of seeing weird stuff and hearing weirder stories at truck stops, were blaring warnings. But the human part, the part that saw a child in distress, was still there, still arguing.

I was tired. So damn tired. Maybe I wasn’t thinking straight. Maybe this was all some bizarre misunderstanding.

I squinted, trying to see past the kid, towards the treeline they’d indicated. Was there a faint trail I was missing? A flicker of light deep in the woods? No. Nothing. Just blackness. Solid, unyielding blackness.

And then I saw it.
It wasn’t something I saw clearly at first. It was more like… an anomaly. A disturbance in the darkness behind the kid.

The kid was standing with their back mostly to the woods, facing my truck. Behind them, the darkness of the forest was absolute. Or it should have been. But there was something… connected to them. Something that stretched from the small of their back, from under the thin pajama top, and disappeared into the deeper shadows of the trees.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow cast by my headlights hitting them at an odd angle. Maybe a rope they were dragging? A piece of clothing snagged on a branch?

I leaned forward, trying to get a clearer view. The kid was still talking, their voice a low, persistent murmur. “It’s not far… please… just help me… I’m so cold…”

But I wasn’t really listening to the words anymore. I was focused on that… that thing behind them.

It wasn’t a rope. It wasn’t a shadow.
It was… a tube. A long, dark, thick tube.
It seemed to emerge directly from the kid’s lower back, impossibly, seamlessly. It was dark matte, like a strip of the night itself given form, and it snaked away from the child, maybe ten, fifteen feet, before disappearing into the inky blackness between two thick pine trunks. It wasn’t rigid; it seemed to have a slight, almost imperceptible flexibility, like a massive, sluggish umbilical cord made of shadow. It didn’t reflect any light from my headlamps. It just… absorbed it.

My breath hitched in my throat. My blood, which had been cold before, now felt like it had frozen solid. This wasn’t just wrong. This was… impossible. Unnatural.

The kid was still trying to coax me. “Are you going to help me? It’s just there. You’re so close.”

My voice, when I finally found it, was barely a whisper. I couldn’t take my eyes off that… appendage.
“Kid… what… what is that? Behind you?”

The kid flinched. Not a big movement, just a tiny, almost imperceptible tightening of their small frame. Their head, which had been tilted pleadingly, straightened. The blankness on their face seemed to… solidify.

“What’s what?” they asked, their voice suddenly devoid of that pleading tone. It was flat again. Colder.

“That… that thing,” I stammered, pointing with a shaking finger. “Coming out of your back. Going into the woods. What is that?”

The kid didn’t turn to look. They didn’t need to. Their gaze, those dark, unseen eyes, bored into me.
“It’s nothing,” they said. The voice was still small, but it had a new edge to it. A hardness. “You’re seeing things. You’re tired.”

They were using my own earlier rationalization against me.

“No,” I said, my voice gaining a tremor of conviction born of sheer terror. “No, I’m not. I see it. It’s right there. It’s… it’s connected to you.”

The kid was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the thumping of my own heart, so loud I was sure they could hear it. The crickets had stopped. The wind seemed to die down. An unnatural stillness fell over the scene.

Then, the kid’s face began to change.
It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-monster transformation. It was far more subtle, and far more terrifying. The blankness didn’t leave, but it… sharpened. The pale skin seemed to tighten over the bones. The areas where the eyes were, those dark smudges, seemed to deepen, to become more shadowed, more intense. And a flicker of something ancient and utterly alien passed across their features. It wasn't human anger. It was something older, colder, and infinitely more patient, now strained to its limit.

The air in my cab suddenly felt thick, heavy, hard to breathe.

“Just come out of the truck,” the kid said, and the voice… oh god, the voice.
It wasn’t the small, reedy voice of a child anymore. It was deeper. Resonant. With a strange, grating undertone, like stones grinding together. It was coming from that small frame, but it was impossibly large, impossibly old. It vibrated in my chest.

“Come out. Now.” The command was absolute.

My hand, which had been hovering near the gearstick, now gripped it like a lifeline. My other hand fumbled for the ignition key, which I’d stupidly left in.

“What are you?” I choked out, staring at the monstrous thing playing dress-up in a child’s form, at the dark, pulsating tube that was its anchor to the shadows.

The kid’s head tilted again, that jerky, unnatural movement. The expression on its face – if you could call it that – was one of pure, unadulterated annoyance. Contempt. Like I was a particularly stupid insect it had failed to swat.

And then it spoke, in that same terrible, resonant, grinding voice. The words it said are burned into my memory, colder than any winter night.

“Why,” it rasped, the sound seeming to scrape the inside of my skull, “the FUCK are humans smarter now?”

That was it.
That one sentence. The sheer, cosmic frustration in it. The implication of past encounters, of easier prey. The utter alien nature of it.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I reacted.
Primal fear, the kind that bypasses all higher brain function, took over.
My hand twisted the key. The diesel engine roared back to life, a sudden, violent explosion of sound in the horrifying stillness.
The kid, the thing, actually recoiled. A small, jerky step back. The expression – that awful, tightened, ancient look – intensified.

I slammed the gearstick into drive. My foot stomped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward, tires spinning on the gravel for a terrifying second before they bit into the asphalt.
I didn’t look at it. I couldn’t. I stared straight ahead, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, the whole cab vibrating around me.

The truck surged forward, gaining speed with agonizing slowness. For a horrible moment, I imagined that tube-thing whipping out, trying to snag the trailer, to pull me back, to drag me into those woods. I imagined that small figure, with its ancient, terrible voice, somehow keeping pace.

I risked a glance in my driver-side mirror.
It was standing there. On the shoulder. Unmoving.
The headlights of my departing truck cast its small silhouette into sharp relief. And behind it, the dark tube was still visible, a thick, obscene cord snaking back into the endless night of the forest. It didn't seem to be retracting or moving. It just was.

The thing didn’t pursue. It just stood and watched me go.
And that, somehow, was almost worse. The sheer confidence. The patience. Like it knew there would be others. Or maybe it was just annoyed that this particular attempt had failed.

I drove.
I don’t know for how long. I just drove. My foot was welded to the floor. The engine screamed. I watched the speedometer needle climb, far past any legal or safe limit for a rig that size, on a road that dark. I didn’t care.
The image of that thing, that child-shape with its dark umbilical to the woods, and that voice, that awful, grinding voice asking its horrifying question, was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.

I must have driven for an hour, maybe more, at speeds that should have gotten me killed or arrested, before the adrenaline started to fade, replaced by a bone-deep, shaking exhaustion that was more profound than any fatigue I’d ever known.
My hands were trembling so violently I could barely keep the wheel straight. Tears were streaming down my face – not from sadness, but from sheer, unadulterated terror and relief.

When the first hint of dawn started to grey the eastern sky, and my phone finally beeped, indicating a single bar of service, I pulled over at the first wide spot I could find. I practically fell out of the cab, vomiting onto the gravel until there was nothing left but dry heaves.
I sat there on the cold ground, shaking, for a long time, watching the sun come up, trying to convince myself that it had been a dream, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion.

But I knew it wasn’t. The detail of that tube. The voice. The question. You don’t hallucinate something that specific, that coherent, that utterly alien.

I never reported it. Who would I report it to? What would I say? ""Officer, I saw a little kid who was actually an ancient cosmic horror tethered to the woods by a nightmare umbilical cord, and it got mad because I didn't want to be its dinner?"" They’d have locked me up. Breathalyzed me, drug tested me, sent me for a psych eval.

I finished that run on autopilot. Dropped the load. Drove my rig back to the yard. And I quit.
I told them I was burned out, needed a break. They tried to convince me to stay, offered me different routes, more pay. I just couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid, that tube, those woods. Every dark road felt like a trap.

I found a local job, something that keeps me home at night. I don’t drive in remote areas anymore if I can help it. Especially not at night. I still have nightmares. Sometimes, when I’m very tired, driving home late from somewhere, I’ll see a flicker at the edge of my vision, on the side of the road, and my heart will try to beat its way out of my chest.

I don’t know what that thing was. An alien? A demon? Something else, something that doesn’t fit into our neat little categories? All I know is that it’s out there. And it’s patient. And it seems to have learned that its old tricks aren't as effective as they used to be.

""Why the fuck are humans smarter now?""

That question haunts me. It implies they weren’t always. It implies that, once upon a time, we were easier. That maybe, just maybe, people like me, tired and alone on dark roads, used to just step out of the cab when asked.
And were never seen again.

So, if you’re ever driving one of those long, lonely stretches of road, deep in the night, and you see something you can’t explain… Maybe just keep driving. Maybe being “smarter now” means knowing when not to stop. Knowing when to ignore that little voice telling you to help, because what’s asking for help might not be what it seems.

Stay safe out there. And for God’s sake, stay on the well-lit roads.",6,1746733930.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

New Concord is a century-old cesspit installed on backwater rock 2.116 × 10^14 miles from California. The weather is hot, sticky and close with constant torrential rain, but at least there's no forest fires here... because there's no damn forests! The tallest plant isn't even a plant, it's basically a photosynthetic fungus that smells like wee. There's whole meadows of it, when the wind blows the wrong way you know.

There's 17 million people here, all squeezed into mile-high, ugly Brutalist tower blocks. There's plenty of amenities I guess.

Food prices are stupid because they have to import most of it. 25 Martian Dollars for a coffee? Insane. 

Most of the workers here ship out every morning to go to the nearby mines, the only reason this place exists. The rest work in bars, shops, entertainment and ""entertainment"".

I'm lucky, my owner works in the Planetary Government, so I get to live in a penthouse overlooking Alverez Bay: it's beautiful, with crystal-clear waters. I'm not allowed to swim in it because there's these transparent mats of stinging algae-like slimes. Gross. Also, storm surges.

The woods pressed in close on this stretch of road, tall, dark pines and dense undergrowth that looked like a solid black wall just beyond the reach of my lights.

The kid wasn’t looking at me. They were facing sort of parallel to the road, just… walking. Slowly. Like they were on a stroll, completely oblivious to the massive eighteen-wheeler that had just pulled up beside them, engine rumbling, lights blazing. They were wearing what looked like pajamas. Thin, light-colored pajamas. In the chill of the night. No coat, no shoes that I could see.

My mind reeled. This was wrong. So many levels of wrong.

I killed the engine. The sudden silence was almost deafening, amplifying the crickets, the rustle of leaves in the woods from a breeze I couldn’t feel in the cab. My heart was still thumping, a weird mix of fear and adrenaline and a dawning sense of responsibility.

I rolled down the  window. The night air hit me, cold and damp, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth.

“Hey!” I called out. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud in the quiet. “Hey, kid!”

No response. They just kept walking, one small, bare foot in front of the other, at a pace that was taking them absolutely nowhere fast. Their head was down, slightly. I couldn’t see their face properly.

“Kid! Are you okay?” I tried again, louder this time.

Slowly, so slowly, the kid stopped. They didn’t turn their head fully, just sort of angled it a fraction, enough that I could see a pale sliver of cheek in the spill of my headlights. Still not looking at me. Still ignoring the multi-ton machine idling beside them.

A prickle of unease ran down my spine. Not the normal kind of unease. This was deeper, colder. Animals act weird sometimes, but kids? A lost kid should be scared, relieved, something. This one was… nothing.

“What are you doing out here all alone?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, friendly. Like you’re supposed to with a scared kid. Even though this one didn’t seem scared at all. “It’s the middle of the night.”

Silence. Just the sound of their bare feet scuffing softly on the gravel as they took another step, then another. As if my presence was a minor inconvenience, a background noise they were choosing to ignore.

This wasn’t right. My internal alarm bells were clanging louder now. My hand hovered near the gearstick. Part of me wanted to slam it into drive and get the hell out of there. But the image of this tiny child, alone, possibly in shock… I couldn’t just leave. Could I?

“Where are your parents?” I pushed, my voice a bit sharper than I intended. “Are you lost?”

Finally, the kid stopped walking completely. They turned their head, just a little more. Still not looking directly at my cab, more towards the front of my truck, into the glare of the headlights. I could see their face a bit better now. Pale. Featureless in the harsh light, like a porcelain doll. Small, dark smudges that might have been eyes. No expression. None. Not fear, not sadness, not relief. Just… blank. An unreadable slate.

Then, a voice. Small. Thin. Like the rustle of dry leaves.
“Lost.”

Just that one word. It hung in the air between us.

Relief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of concern. Okay, lost. That’s something I can deal with. “Okay, kid. Lost is okay. We can fix lost. Where do you live? Where were you going?”

The kid finally, slowly, turned their head fully towards my cab. Towards me.
I still couldn’t make out much detail in their face. The angle, the light, something was obscuring it, keeping it in a sort of shadowy vagueness despite the headlights. But I could feel their gaze. It wasn't like a normal kid's look. There was a weight to it, an intensity that was deeply unsettling for such a small form.

“Home,” the kid said, that same thin, reedy voice. “Trying to get home.”

“Right, home. Where is home?” I asked, leaning forward a bit, trying to project reassurance. “Is it near here? Did you wander off from a campsite? A car?” There were no campsites for miles. No broken-down cars on the shoulder. I knew that.

The kid didn’t answer that question directly. Instead, they took a small step towards the truck. Then another. My hand tensed on the door handle, ready to open it, to offer… what? A ride? Shelter? I didn’t know.

“It’s cold out here,” I said, stating the obvious. “You should get in. We can get you warm, and I can call for help when we get to a spot with a signal.” My CB was useless, just static. My phone had shown ‘No Service’ for the last hour.

The kid stopped about five feet from my passenger door. Still in that pale, thin pajama-like outfit. Barefoot on the sharp gravel. They should be shivering, crying. They were doing neither.

“Can you help me?” the kid asked. The voice was still small, but there was a different inflection to it now. Less flat. A hint of… something else. Pleading, maybe?

“Yeah, of course, I can help you,” I said. “That’s why I stopped. Where are your parents? How did you get here?”

The kid tilted their head. A jerky, unnatural little movement. “They’re waiting. At home.”

“Okay… And where’s home? Which direction?” I gestured vaguely up and down the empty highway.

The kid didn’t point down the road. They made a small, subtle gesture with their head, a little nod, towards the trees. Towards the impenetrable darkness of the woods lining the highway.

“In there,” the kid said.

My stomach clenched. “In the woods? Your home is in the woods?”

“Lost,” the kid repeated, as if that explained everything. “Trying to find the path. It’s dark.”

“Yeah, it’s… it’s very dark,” I agreed, my eyes scanning the treeline. It looked like a solid wall of black. No sign of any path, any habitation. Just dense, old-growth forest. The kind of place you could get lost in for days, even in daylight.

“Can you… come out?” the kid asked. “Help me look? It’s not far. I just… I can’t see it from here.”

Every rational thought in my head screamed NO. Get out of the truck? In the middle of nowhere, in the pitch dark, with this… strange child, who wanted me to go into those woods? No. Absolutely not.

But the kid looked so small. So vulnerable. If there was even a tiny chance they were telling the truth, that their house was just a little way in, and they were genuinely lost…

“I… I don’t think that’s a good idea, buddy,” I said, trying to sound gentle. “It’s dangerous in there at night. For both of us. Best thing is for you to hop in here with me. We’ll drive until we get a signal, and then we’ll call the police, or the rangers. They can help find your home properly.”

The kid just stood there. That blank, unreadable face fixed on me.
“But it’s right there,” they insisted, their voice a little more insistent now. “Just a little way. I can almost see it. If you just… step out… the light from your door would help.”

My skin was crawling. There was something profoundly wrong with this scenario. The way they were trying to coax me out. The lack of normal emotional response. The pajamas. The bare feet. The woods.

I looked closer at the kid, trying to pierce that strange vagueness around their features. My headlights were bright, but it was like they absorbed the light rather than reflected it. Their eyes… I still couldn’t really see their eyes. Just dark hollows.

“I really think you should get in the truck,” I said, my voice firmer now. “It’s warmer in here. We can figure it out together.”

The kid took another step closer. They were almost at my running board now.
“Please?” they said. That reedy voice again. “My leg hurts. I can’t walk much further. If you could just… help me a little. Just to the path.”

My internal conflict was raging. My trucker instincts, honed by years of seeing weird stuff and hearing weirder stories at truck stops, were blaring warnings. But the human part, the part that saw a child in distress, was still there, still arguing.

I was tired. So damn tired. Maybe I wasn’t thinking straight. Maybe this was all some bizarre misunderstanding.

I squinted, trying to see past the kid, towards the treeline they’d indicated. Was there a faint trail I was missing? A flicker of light deep in the woods? No. Nothing. Just blackness. Solid, unyielding blackness.

And then I saw it.
It wasn’t something I saw clearly at first. It was more like… an anomaly. A disturbance in the darkness behind the kid.

The kid was standing with their back mostly to the woods, facing my truck. Behind them, the darkness of the forest was absolute. Or it should have been. But there was something… connected to them. Something that stretched from the small of their back, from under the thin pajama top, and disappeared into the deeper shadows of the trees.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow cast by my headlights hitting them at an odd angle. Maybe a rope they were dragging? A piece of clothing snagged on a branch?

I leaned forward, trying to get a clearer view. The kid was still talking, their voice a low, persistent murmur. “It’s not far… please… just help me… I’m so cold…”

But I wasn’t really listening to the words anymore. I was focused on that… that thing behind them.

It wasn’t a rope. It wasn’t a shadow.
It was… a tube. A long, dark, thick tube.
It seemed to emerge directly from the kid’s lower back, impossibly, seamlessly. It was dark matte, like a strip of the night itself given form, and it snaked away from the child, maybe ten, fifteen feet, before disappearing into the inky blackness between two thick pine trunks. It wasn’t rigid; it seemed to have a slight, almost imperceptible flexibility, like a massive, sluggish umbilical cord made of shadow. It didn’t reflect any light from my headlamps. It just… absorbed it.

My breath hitched in my throat. My blood, which had been cold before, now felt like it had frozen solid. This wasn’t just wrong. This was… impossible. Unnatural.

The kid was still trying to coax me. “Are you going to help me? It’s just there. You’re so close.”

My voice, when I finally found it, was barely a whisper. I couldn’t take my eyes off that… appendage.
“Kid… what… what is that? Behind you?”

The kid flinched. Not a big movement, just a tiny, almost imperceptible tightening of their small frame. Their head, which had been tilted pleadingly, straightened. The blankness on their face seemed to… solidify.

“What’s what?” they asked, their voice suddenly devoid of that pleading tone. It was flat again. Colder.

“That… that thing,” I stammered, pointing with a shaking finger. “Coming out of your back. Going into the woods. What is that?”

The kid didn’t turn to look. They didn’t need to. Their gaze, those dark, unseen eyes, bored into me.
“It’s nothing,” they said. The voice was still small, but it had a new edge to it. A hardness. “You’re seeing things. You’re tired.”

They were using my own earlier rationalization against me.

“No,” I said, my voice gaining a tremor of conviction born of sheer terror. “No, I’m not. I see it. It’s right there. It’s… it’s connected to you.”

The kid was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the thumping of my own heart, so loud I was sure they could hear it. The crickets had stopped. The wind seemed to die down. An unnatural stillness fell over the scene.

Then, the kid’s face began to change.
It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-monster transformation. It was far more subtle, and far more terrifying. The blankness didn’t leave, but it… sharpened. The pale skin seemed to tighten over the bones. The areas where the eyes were, those dark smudges, seemed to deepen, to become more shadowed, more intense. And a flicker of something ancient and utterly alien passed across their features. It wasn't human anger. It was something older, colder, and infinitely more patient, now strained to its limit.

The air in my cab suddenly felt thick, heavy, hard to breathe.

“Just come out of the truck,” the kid said, and the voice… oh god, the voice.
It wasn’t the small, reedy voice of a child anymore. It was deeper. Resonant. With a strange, grating undertone, like stones grinding together. It was coming from that small frame, but it was impossibly large, impossibly old. It vibrated in my chest.

“Come out. Now.” The command was absolute.

My hand, which had been hovering near the gearstick, now gripped it like a lifeline. My other hand fumbled for the ignition key, which I’d stupidly left in.

“What are you?” I choked out, staring at the monstrous thing playing dress-up in a child’s form, at the dark, pulsating tube that was its anchor to the shadows.

The kid’s head tilted again, that jerky, unnatural movement. The expression on its face – if you could call it that – was one of pure, unadulterated annoyance. Contempt. Like I was a particularly stupid insect it had failed to swat.

And then it spoke, in that same terrible, resonant, grinding voice. The words it said are burned into my memory, colder than any winter night.

“Why,” it rasped, the sound seeming to scrape the inside of my skull, “the FUCK are humans smarter now?”

That was it.
That one sentence. The sheer, cosmic frustration in it. The implication of past encounters, of easier prey. The utter alien nature of it.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I reacted.
Primal fear, the kind that bypasses all higher brain function, took over.
My hand twisted the key. The diesel engine roared back to life, a sudden, violent explosion of sound in the horrifying stillness.
The kid, the thing, actually recoiled. A small, jerky step back. The expression – that awful, tightened, ancient look – intensified.

I slammed the gearstick into drive. My foot stomped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward, tires spinning on the gravel for a terrifying second before they bit into the asphalt.
I didn’t look at it. I couldn’t. I stared straight ahead, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, the whole cab vibrating around me.

The truck surged forward, gaining speed with agonizing slowness. For a horrible moment, I imagined that tube-thing whipping out, trying to snag the trailer, to pull me back, to drag me into those woods. I imagined that small figure, with its ancient, terrible voice, somehow keeping pace.

I risked a glance in my driver-side mirror.
It was standing there. On the shoulder. Unmoving.
The headlights of my departing truck cast its small silhouette into sharp relief. And behind it, the dark tube was still visible, a thick, obscene cord snaking back into the endless night of the forest. It didn't seem to be retracting or moving. It just was.

The thing didn’t pursue. It just stood and watched me go.
And that, somehow, was almost worse. The sheer confidence. The patience. Like it knew there would be others. Or maybe it was just annoyed that this particular attempt had failed.

I drove.
I don’t know for how long. I just drove. My foot was welded to the floor. The engine screamed. I watched the speedometer needle climb, far past any legal or safe limit for a rig that size, on a road that dark. I didn’t care.
The image of that thing, that child-shape with its dark umbilical to the woods, and that voice, that awful, grinding voice asking its horrifying question, was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.

I must have driven for an hour, maybe more, at speeds that should have gotten me killed or arrested, before the adrenaline started to fade, replaced by a bone-deep, shaking exhaustion that was more profound than any fatigue I’d ever known.
My hands were trembling so violently I could barely keep the wheel straight. Tears were streaming down my face – not from sadness, but from sheer, unadulterated terror and relief.

When the first hint of dawn started to grey the eastern sky, and my phone finally beeped, indicating a single bar of service, I pulled over at the first wide spot I could find. I practically fell out of the cab, vomiting onto the gravel until there was nothing left but dry heaves.
I sat there on the cold ground, shaking, for a long time, watching the sun come up, trying to convince myself that it had been a dream, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion.

But I knew it wasn’t. The detail of that tube. The voice. The question. You don’t hallucinate something that specific, that coherent, that utterly alien.

I never reported it. Who would I report it to? What would I say? ""Officer, I saw a little kid who was actually an ancient cosmic horror tethered to the woods by a nightmare umbilical cord, and it got mad because I didn't want to be its dinner?"" They’d have locked me up. Breathalyzed me, drug tested me, sent me for a psych eval.

I finished that run on autopilot. Dropped the load. Drove my rig back to the yard. And I quit.
I told them I was burned out, needed a break. They tried to convince me to stay, offered me different routes, more pay. I just couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid, that tube, those woods. Every dark road felt like a trap.

I found a local job, something that keeps me home at night. I don’t drive in remote areas anymore if I can help it. Especially not at night. I still have nightmares. Sometimes, when I’m very tired, driving home late from somewhere, I’ll see a flicker at the edge of my vision, on the side of the road, and my heart will try to beat its way out of my chest.

I don’t know what that thing was. An alien? A demon? Something else, something that doesn’t fit into our neat little categories? All I know is that it’s out there. And it’s patient. And it seems to have learned that its old tricks aren't as effective as they used to be.

""Why the fuck are humans smarter now?""

That question haunts me. It implies they weren’t always. It implies that, once upon a time, we were easier. That maybe, just maybe, people like me, tired and alone on dark roads, used to just step out of the cab when asked.
And were never seen again.

So, if you’re ever driving one of those long, lonely stretches of road, deep in the night, and you see something you can’t explain… Maybe just keep driving. Maybe being “smarter now” means knowing when not to stop. Knowing when to ignore that little voice telling you to help, because what’s asking for help might not be what it seems.

This happened a few years back. I was doing long-haul, mostly cross-country routes, the kind that take you through vast stretches of nothing. You know the ones – where the radio turns to static for hours, and the only sign of life is the occasional pair of headlights going the other way, miles apart. I was young, eager for the miles, the money. Didn’t mind the solitude. Or so I thought.

The route I was on took me across a long, desolate stretch of highway that ran between the borders of two large governmental territories. I don’t want to say exactly where, but think big, empty spaces, lots of trees, not much else. It was notorious among drivers for being a dead zone – no signal, no towns for a hundred miles either side, and prone to weird weather. Most guys tried to hit it during daylight, but schedules are schedules. Mine had me crossing it deep in the night.

I remember the feeling. Utter blackness outside the sweep of my headlights. The kind of dark that feels like it’s pressing in on the cab. The only sounds were the drone of the diesel engine, the hiss of the air brakes now and then, and the rhythmic thrum of the tires on asphalt. Hypnotic. Too hypnotic.

I’d been driving for about ten hours, with a short break a few states back. Coffee was wearing off. The dashboard lights were a dull green glow, comforting in a way, but also making the darkness outside seem even more absolute. My eyelids felt like they had lead weights attached. You fight it, you know? Slap your face, roll down the window for a blast of cold air, crank up whatever music you can find that hasn’t dissolved into static. I was doing all of that.

It must have been around 2 or 3 AM. I was in that weird state where you’re not quite asleep, but not fully awake either. Like your brain is running on low power mode. The white lines on the road were starting to blur together, stretching and warping. Standard fatigue stuff. I remember blinking hard, trying to refocus.

That’s when I saw it. Or thought I saw it.

Just a flicker at the edge of my headlights, on the right shoulder of the road. Small. Low to the ground. For a split second, I registered a shape, vaguely human-like, and then it was gone, swallowed by the darkness as I passed.

My first thought? Deer. Or a coyote. Common enough. But it hadn't moved like an animal. It had been upright. My brain, sluggish as it was, tried to process it. Too small for an adult. Too still for an animal startled by a rig.

Then the logical part, the part that was still trying to keep me safe on the road, chimed in: You’re tired. Seeing things. Happens.

And I almost accepted that. I really did. Shook my head, took a swig of lukewarm water from the bottle beside me. Kept my eyes glued to the road ahead. The image, though, it kind of stuck. A small, upright shape. Like a child.

No way, I told myself. Out here? Middle of nowhere? Middle of the night? Impossible. Kids don’t just wander around on inter-territorial highways at 3 AM. It had to be a trick of the light, a bush, my eyes playing games. I’ve seen weirder things born of exhaustion. Shadows that dance, trees that look like figures. It’s part of the job when you’re pushing limits.

I drove on for maybe another thirty seconds, the image fading, my rational mind starting to win. Just a figment.
Then, I glanced at my passenger-side mirror. Habit. Always checking.

And my blood went cold. Not just cold, it felt like it turned to slush.

There, illuminated faintly by the red glow of my trailer lights receding into the distance, was the reflection of a small figure. Standing. On the shoulder of the road. Exactly where I’d thought I’d seen something.

It wasn’t a bush. It wasn’t a shadow. It was small, and it was definitely standing there, unmoving, as my truck pulled further and further away.

My heart started hammering against my ribs. This wasn’t fatigue. This was real. There was someone, something, back there. And it looked tiny.

Every instinct screamed at me. Danger. Wrong. Keep going. But another voice, the one that makes us human, I suppose, whispered something else. A kid? Alone out here? What if they’re hurt? Lost?

I fought with myself for a few seconds that stretched into an eternity. The image in the mirror was getting smaller, fainter. If I didn’t act now, they’d be lost to the darkness again. God, the thought of leaving a child out there, if that’s what it was…

Against my better judgment, against that primal urge to just floor it, I made a decision. I slowed the rig, the air brakes hissing like angry snakes. Pulled over to the shoulder, the truck groaning in protest. Put on my hazards, their rhythmic flashing cutting into the oppressive blackness.

Then, I did what you’re never supposed to do with a full trailer on a narrow shoulder. I started to reverse. Slowly. Carefully. My eyes flicking between the mirrors, trying to keep the trailer straight, trying to relocate that tiny figure. The crunch of gravel under the tires sounded unnaturally loud.

It took a minute, maybe two, but it felt like an hour. The red glow of my tail lights eventually washed over the spot again. And there it was.

A kid.

I stopped the truck so my cab was roughly alongside them, maybe ten feet away. Switched on the high beams, hoping to get a better look, and also to make myself clearly visible as just a truck, not something else.

The kid was… small. Really small. I’d guess maybe six, seven years old? Hard to tell in the glare. They were just standing there, on the very edge of the gravel shoulder, right where the trees began. The woods pressed in close on this stretch of road, tall, dark pines and dense undergrowth that looked like a solid black wall just beyond the reach of my lights.

The kid wasn’t looking at me. They were facing sort of parallel to the road, just… walking. Slowly. Like they were on a stroll, completely oblivious to the massive eighteen-wheeler that had just pulled up beside them, engine rumbling, lights blazing. They were wearing what looked like pajamas. Thin, light-colored pajamas. In the chill of the night. No coat, no shoes that I could see.

My mind reeled. This was wrong. So many levels of wrong.

I killed the engine. The sudden silence was almost deafening, amplifying the crickets, the rustle of leaves in the woods from a breeze I couldn’t feel in the cab. My heart was still thumping, a weird mix of fear and adrenaline and a dawning sense of responsibility.

I rolled down the  window. The night air hit me, cold and damp, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth.

“Hey!” I called out. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud in the quiet. “Hey, kid!”

No response. They just kept walking, one small, bare foot in front of the other, at a pace that was taking them absolutely nowhere fast. Their head was down, slightly. I couldn’t see their face properly.

“Kid! Are you okay?” I tried again, louder this time.

Slowly, so slowly, the kid stopped. They didn’t turn their head fully, just sort of angled it a fraction, enough that I could see a pale sliver of cheek in the spill of my headlights. Still not looking at me. Still ignoring the multi-ton machine idling beside them.

A prickle of unease ran down my spine. Not the normal kind of unease. This was deeper, colder. Animals act weird sometimes, but kids? A lost kid should be scared, relieved, something. This one was… nothing.

“What are you doing out here all alone?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, friendly. Like you’re supposed to with a scared kid. Even though this one didn’t seem scared at all. “It’s the middle of the night.”

Silence. Just the sound of their bare feet scuffing softly on the gravel as they took another step, then another. As if my presence was a minor inconvenience, a background noise they were choosing to ignore.

Not fear, not sadness, not relief. Just… blank. An unreadable slate.

Then, a voice. Small. Thin. Like the rustle of dry leaves.
“Lost.”

Just that one word. It hung in the air between us.

Relief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of concern. Okay, lost. That’s something I can deal with. “Okay, kid. Lost is okay. We can fix lost. Where do you live? Where were you going?”

Every rational thought in my head screamed NO. Get out of the truck? In the middle of nowhere, in the pitch dark, with this… strange child, who wanted me to go into those woods? No. Absolutely not.

The kid took another step closer. They were almost at my running board now.
“Please?” they said. That reedy voice again. “My leg hurts. I can’t walk much further. If you could just… help me a little. Just to the path.”

My internal conflict was raging. My trucker instincts, honed by years of seeing weird stuff and hearing weirder stories at truck stops, were blaring warnings. But the human part, the part that saw a child in distress, was still there, still arguing.

I was tired. So damn tired. Maybe I wasn’t thinking straight. Maybe this was all some bizarre misunderstanding.

I squinted, trying to see past the kid, towards the treeline they’d indicated. Was there a faint trail I was missing? A flicker of light deep in the woods? No. Nothing. Just blackness. Solid, unyielding blackness.

And then I saw it.
It wasn’t something I saw clearly at first. It was more like… an anomaly. A disturbance in the darkness behind the kid.

The kid was standing with their back mostly to the woods, facing my truck. Behind them, the darkness of the forest was absolute. Or it should have been. But there was something… connected to them. Something that stretched from the small of their back, from under the thin pajama top, and disappeared into the deeper shadows of the trees.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow cast by my headlights hitting them at an odd angle. Maybe a rope they were dragging? A piece of clothing snagged on a branch?

I leaned forward, trying to get a clearer view. The kid was still talking, their voice a low, persistent murmur. “It’s not far… please… just help me… I’m so cold…”

But I wasn’t really listening to the words anymore. I was focused on that… that thing behind them.

It wasn’t a rope. It wasn’t a shadow.
It was… a tube. A long, dark, thick tube.
It seemed to emerge directly from the kid’s lower back, impossibly, seamlessly. It was dark matte, like a strip of the night itself given form, and it snaked away from the child, maybe ten, fifteen feet, before disappearing into the inky blackness between two thick pine trunks. It wasn’t rigid; it seemed to have a slight, almost imperceptible flexibility, like a massive, sluggish umbilical cord made of shadow. It didn’t reflect any light from my headlamps. It just… absorbed it.

My breath hitched in my throat. My blood, which had been cold before, now felt like it had frozen solid. This wasn’t just wrong. This was… impossible. Unnatural.

The kid was still trying to coax me. “Are you going to help me? It’s just there. You’re so close.”

My voice, when I finally found it, was barely a whisper. I couldn’t take my eyes off that… appendage.
“Kid… what… what is that? Behind you?”

The kid flinched. Not a big movement, just a tiny, almost imperceptible tightening of their small frame. Their head, which had been tilted pleadingly, straightened. The blankness on their face seemed to… solidify.

“What’s what?” they asked, their voice suddenly devoid of that pleading tone. It was flat again. Colder.

“That… that thing,” I stammered, pointing with a shaking finger. “Coming out of your back. Going into the woods. What is that?”

The kid didn’t turn to look. They didn’t need to. Their gaze, those dark, unseen eyes, bored into me.
“It’s nothing,” they said. The voice was still small, but it had a new edge to it. A hardness. “You’re seeing things. You’re tired.”

They were using my own earlier rationalization against me.

“No,” I said, my voice gaining a tremor of conviction born of sheer terror. “No, I’m not. I see it. It’s right there. It’s… it’s connected to you.”

The kid was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the thumping of my own heart, so loud I was sure they could hear it. The crickets had stopped. The wind seemed to die down. An unnatural stillness fell over the scene.

Then, the kid’s face began to change.
It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-monster transformation. It was far more subtle, and far more terrifying. The blankness didn’t leave, but it… sharpened. The pale skin seemed to tighten over the bones. The areas where the eyes were, those dark smudges, seemed to deepen, to become more shadowed, more intense. And a flicker of something ancient and utterly alien passed across their features. It wasn't human anger. It was something older, colder, and infinitely more patient, now strained to its limit.

The air in my cab suddenly felt thick, heavy, hard to breathe.

“Just come out of the truck,” the kid said, and the voice… oh god, the voice.
It wasn’t the small, reedy voice of a child anymore. It was deeper. Resonant. With a strange, grating undertone, like stones grinding together. It was coming from that small frame, but it was impossibly large, impossibly old. It vibrated in my chest.

“Come out. Now.” The command was absolute.

My hand, which had been hovering near the gearstick, now gripped it like a lifeline. My other hand fumbled for the ignition key, which I’d stupidly left in.

“What are you?” I choked out, staring at the monstrous thing playing dress-up in a child’s form, at the dark, pulsating tube that was its anchor to the shadows.

The kid’s head tilted again, that jerky, unnatural movement. The expression on its face – if you could call it that – was one of pure, unadulterated annoyance. Contempt. Like I was a particularly stupid insect it had failed to swat.

And then it spoke, in that same terrible, resonant, grinding voice. The words it said are burned into my memory, colder than any winter night.

“Why,” it rasped, the sound seeming to scrape the inside of my skull, “the FUCK are humans smarter now?”

That was it.
That one sentence. The sheer, cosmic frustration in it. The implication of past encounters, of easier prey. The utter alien nature of it.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I reacted.
Primal fear, the kind that bypasses all higher brain function, took over.
My hand twisted the key. The diesel engine roared back to life, a sudden, violent explosion of sound in the horrifying stillness.
The kid, the thing, actually recoiled. A small, jerky step back. The expression – that awful, tightened, ancient look – intensified.

I slammed the gearstick into drive. My foot stomped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward, tires spinning on the gravel for a terrifying second before they bit into the asphalt.
I didn’t look at it. I couldn’t. I stared straight ahead, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, the whole cab vibrating around me.

The truck surged forward, gaining speed with agonizing slowness. For a horrible moment, I imagined that tube-thing whipping out, trying to snag the trailer, to pull me back, to drag me into those woods. I imagined that small figure, with its ancient, terrible voice, somehow keeping pace.

I risked a glance in my driver-side mirror.
It was standing there. On the shoulder. Unmoving.
The headlights of my departing truck cast its small silhouette into sharp relief. And behind it, the dark tube was still visible, a thick, obscene cord snaking back into the endless night of the forest. It didn't seem to be retracting or moving. It just was.

The thing didn’t pursue. It just stood and watched me go.
And that, somehow, was almost worse. The sheer confidence. The patience. Like it knew there would be others. Or maybe it was just annoyed that this particular attempt had failed.

I drove.
I don’t know for how long. I just drove. My foot was welded to the floor. The engine screamed. I watched the speedometer needle climb, far past any legal or safe limit for a rig that size, on a road that dark. I didn’t care.
The image of that thing, that child-shape with its dark umbilical to the woods, and that voice, that awful, grinding voice asking its horrifying question, was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.

I must have driven for an hour, maybe more, at speeds that should have gotten me killed or arrested, before the adrenaline started to fade, replaced by a bone-deep, shaking exhaustion that was more profound than any fatigue I’d ever known.
My hands were trembling so violently I could barely keep the wheel straight. Tears were streaming down my face – not from sadness, but from sheer, unadulterated terror and relief.

When the first hint of dawn started to grey the eastern sky, and my phone finally beeped, indicating a single bar of service, I pulled over at the first wide spot I could find. I practically fell out of the cab, vomiting onto the gravel until there was nothing left but dry heaves.
I sat there on the cold ground, shaking, for a long time, watching the sun come up, trying to convince myself that it had been a dream, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion.

But I knew it wasn’t. The detail of that tube. The voice. The question. You don’t hallucinate something that specific, that coherent, that utterly alien.

I never reported it. Who would I report it to? What would I say? ""Officer, I saw a little kid who was actually an ancient cosmic horror tethered to the woods by a nightmare umbilical cord, and it got mad because I didn't want to be its dinner?"" They’d have locked me up. Breathalyzed me, drug tested me, sent me for a psych eval.

I finished that run on autopilot. Dropped the load. Drove my rig back to the yard. And I quit.
I told them I was burned out, needed a break. They tried to convince me to stay, offered me different routes, more pay. I just couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid, that tube, those woods. Every dark road felt like a trap.

I found a local job, something that keeps me home at night. I don’t drive in remote areas anymore if I can help it. Especially not at night. I still have nightmares. Sometimes, when I’m very tired, driving home late from somewhere, I’ll see a flicker at the edge of my vision, on the side of the road, and my heart will try to beat its way out of my chest.

I don’t know what that thing was. An alien? A demon? Something else, something that doesn’t fit into our neat little categories? All I know is that it’s out there. And it’s patient. And it seems to have learned that its old tricks aren't as effective as they used to be.

""Why the fuck are humans smarter now?""

That question haunts me. It implies they weren’t always. It implies that, once upon a time, we were easier. That maybe, just maybe, people like me, tired and alone on dark roads, used to just step out of the cab when asked.
And were never seen again.

So, if you’re ever driving one of those long, lonely stretches of road, deep in the night, and you see something you can’t explain… Maybe just keep driving. Maybe being “smarter now” means knowing when not to stop. Knowing when to ignore that little voice telling you to help, because what’s asking for help might not be what it seems.

Stay safe out there. And for God’s sake, stay on the well-lit roads.",18,1746733870.0,stories,4,0.91,False

Ended up installing ProtonVPN and Windscribe, since they’re both always on the best free VPN lists and don’t have crazy permissions. Proton’s been decent for simple stuff like Reddit and email, but it slows down during peak hours. Windscribe feels a little faster and gives more server options even on the free plan. So far, no sketchy behavior or weird tracking.

I get that free always comes with trade-offs, but are there any other free VPNs that people here actually trust in 2025?

It was a day like any other—me, trying to drag myself out of bed, hitting the snooze button until the last possible second. Honestly, I don’t know how I survived waking up at stupid hours back when I was in the military. Not that I enjoyed it then, but it’s definitely harder now.

That day—the day I died—I wasn’t thinking about the end. I was just trying not to be late for class. After finally planting my feet on the floor, I rushed to the bathroom. I had maybe twenty minutes to get out the door—ten if I wanted coffee. I was pushing for ten. I needed the caffeine.

In a frenzy of face-washing and the eternal hunt for a bra (because let’s be real, we all just fling those torture devices across the room the second we get the chance), I somehow got dressed and ready to fight the day.

I paused at the door. A pang hit me—my baby was gone. My cat, my companion through years of service, had passed away just last week. He was sixteen. Once cats hit their golden years, you never really know. My childhood cat lived to be twenty-one—mean as hell to everyone but my mom and me, and only liked me in the morning because I was the one who fed her. Poor Sunshine, our dog, just wanted to be her friend. She’d swat him on sight.

(My dad named the pets. He loves animals but is terrible at naming them. He wanted to name me Mariha. My mom thankfully vetoed that.)

My big tabby had the softest green eyes and loved cuddles—except when he was sneak-attacking me with leg licks. Kidney failure. It happened so fast. One minute I saw blood in his litter box, the next I was at the emergency vet being told there was nothing they could do. I held him as he slipped away. I chose to have him cremated. I’ll scatter his ashes at the docks in my hometown, with the rest of my childhood pets. They never met, but I like to think they’ll be friends now. And I’ll have one place to visit them all.

I shook off the thought, grabbed my tablet and case, checked for my knock-off Apple Pen and charger, and left—completely unaware it would be my last time.

Gray strands of *something–*maybe cobwebs or ripped insulation–hung from the rafters above. The crowd was so thick I couldn't move, but even more masked, half-dressed people were still coming down the stairs. As a pre-med student, I knew that standing so close to the speakers meant guaranteed hearing damage--

But I was just glad to be attending my first-ever college party.

A shirtless guy with curly black hair gripped the sides of a keg and flexed into a perfect handstand. He chugged so much beer that I felt sick just watching him, then dive-rolled into the shrieking crowd. He was my roommate, Brett Harrison the Third, and he was the only reason why I had been invited out that night.

The truth was, I never felt like I fit at this elite university, or even in this country. My parents immigrated to the United States from Japan a few weeks after my ninth birthday. I was just old enough to understand that I was leaving my home and friends behind forever, but still too young to think of the change as an opportunity.

Everyone was so much louder and more aggressive than I was used to, the food was greasy or overly-sweet, and most of my classmates didn’t seem to care about school at all. Every night, I prayed that my parents would take me back to my home country--

But their minds were made up. 

As far as they were concerned, my future was already decided: I would graduate from a U.S. high school, study medicine at a top-tier university, and have a respectable, high-paying career anywhere that I pleased. *Couldn’t I see how much they were sacrificing to give me this once-in-a-lifetime chance?*

My classmates didn’t understand the pressure I was under, or why I had to prioritize studying over socializing. By my second year of college, I had resigned myself to a friendless existence…and then, Brett moved in.

It didn’t matter to *him* that I always had my nose buried in a textbook: he would kick up his feet and talk at me anyway. No matter how many times I turned down his invitations, he just kept repeating them. I knew that Brett didn't need a friend–just an audience–but the companionship was nice all the same.

Now Brett was polishing off a bottle of gin and breaking it against his head, for reasons that could only have made sense in Brett-land. I was amazed by how much the guy could drink, and that night–on our walk back from the party–I finally worked up the nerve to ask him what his secret was. 

*It’s a gift,* Brett said with a wink. Seeing the blank expression on my face, he paused beneath a streetlight and stared. *You really don’t know, do you? You’ve never heard about the Gift-Giver!* It sounded like the start of a bad joke, but Brett was completely serious. The wind blew dead, crackling leaves across the lonely night time street as my roommate began his story.

According to Brett’s grandfather, who had been the first in his family to attend our university, the Gift-Giver legend was as old as the campus itself. He only appeared between midnight and dawn, and even then, he only showed himself to students who were struggling through some kind of problem alone. 

Brett claimed to have met the Gift-Giver while puking into a trash can beside the rec center: the only problem on his mind that night had been wishing that he could drink as much alcohol as he wanted with no consequences afterward. Dimly aware of a presence beside him, he had turned his head sideways and spotted a pair of shiny black shoes. After standing there silently for a long moment, the owner of the old-fashioned footwear had told Brett that what he was looking for was in the top drawer of his desk. When he checked later, he found a container of tiny red pills that hadn’t been there before. If he took one before a night out, Brett said, it didn’t matter how much he drank: all he would feel was a pleasant, consequence-free buzz.

Breaking down Brett's story, it sounded to me like what had *really* happened was that my roommate had met a pill dealer while on a bender, wandered home blackout, and filled in the gaps in his memory with his grandfather’s tall tale. Only one part of the story made sense: faced with an offer of anything that a person could wish for, it was just like Brett Harrison the Third to request a cure for a hangover. When I asked him what the Gift-Giver had wanted in return, however, he just squinted at me: *it was a gift, right? Aren’t gifts supposed to be free?*

A few minutes later, Brett spotted some girls he knew and jogged across the street to talk to them, leaving me to finish the walk back to our dorm alone. I didn't blame him: if I had his confidence, I would have probably done the same thing.Strolling toward campus with my hands stuffed in my pockets, I couldn't help but wonder about the Gift-Giver. *If I ran into him now, what would I ask for?* I didn't have a clear answer to my own question–not then, anyway.

I started partying with Brett more and more after that night. I told myself that I was finally coming out of my shell, but the real reasons were more complicated than that. It was my junior year, and classes were tougher than ever. My grades were slipping, and the only way that I could pretend that things were going to be alright was by ignoring them completely.

When I finally dared to look, it was worse than I had imagined. I was at risk of losing my scholarship, and unlike Brett, I didn't have a millionaire family whose donations guaranteed that I would graduate. It wasn't just that I was going to fail out of school: it was that my parents’ sacrifice--

And everything that I had given up to meet their expectations–

It was all going to have been for nothing.

The only way that I could turn things around was by achieving a 97% or higher on the end-of-course exam. The problem was, I doubted I would even be able to pass the test, much less earn a near-perfect score. Soon, not even Brett’s parties were enough to make me forget what was coming. 

I began going for long walks alone at night, barely paying attention to the weather, my surroundings, or even where I was going. I wandered through silent parking lots and between lightless buildings, discovering parts of campus that I never knew existed…and that was how I finally met the Gift-Giver.

As the cold intensified, I had taken to bringing a thermos of hot coffee with me on my walks. That night, I stopped on a bench behind the university’s power plant to take a few sips. Why there was a bench between a chain-link fence and some undeveloped woods was a mystery, but it felt like as good a place as any for a rest.

I was about to continue my walk when I noticed someone standing at the corner of the fence. Backlit by the power plant’s lights, I couldn't make out their features: only an old-fashioned umbrella, a baggy gray suit…and a pair of polished black shoes.

The figure lurched toward me with an uneven gait, limping as though they had been crippled by some terrible accident. Rather than feeling sympathetic, however, I was suddenly afraid: I looked at the ground, hoping that the stranger would pass by–

But he sat down beside me instead.

Somehow, he had crossed the distance between us in only a few seconds. I kept my eyes down, a gut instinct warning me that if I looked at the stranger’s face, I might not like what I saw.

*Stay away from your exam on Friday,* he whispered, in a guttural voice that made my hair stand on end. *If you don’t go, your score will be the best in your class. I guarantee it.* Before I could respond, he pushed himself painfully back to his feet and hobbled away into the darkness. The whole encounter couldn’t have lasted more than two minutes, and when it was over, I found myself questioning whether it had ever happened at all. *Was this what going crazy felt like?* 

My exam was just two days away, and I spent every waking minute of them agonizing over what I should do. Part of me was convinced that I had actually met the Gift-Giver, but another part was sure that the whole thing had just been a hallucination brought on by stress. At four AM on the morning of the test, I groaned, rolled over in bed, and switched off my alarm. *The hell with it,* I thought. *I was going to fail anyway, so why not give the Gift-Giver a chance to work his magic?*

I woke up twenty minutes before the exam was scheduled to start, and with nothing better to do, I strolled to the dining hall for a late breakfast. On the way, I ran into Brett. He scratched his head when he saw me: *didn't I have an exam this morning?*

I gave him a wink. *The Gift-Giver was taking care of it,* I said. Brett went pale: I had never seen him look so serious. He put his hand on my shoulder. *You need to get to your test,* he whispered. 

I ran. I ran even though I didn't know why I was running–even though I was probably already too late. *Had Brett been trying to tell me that his story was bullshit, or was there something more sinister behind his words? Had his own ‘gift’ gone wrong somehow?* There was no time to think it over: I arrived on the second floor of the Science Building with my heels skidding on the hallway tiles, just in time to watch all sixteen of my classmates file into the exam room. 

*Wait. Sixteen?!*

There were sixteen people in my Organic Chemistry III class…*including me.* There was something odd about the guy standing in the shadows at the end of the line, but I didn’t believe it until he stepped into the light.

He was…*me.* A perfect copy. Our identical eyes met and his mouth stretched into a too-wide, wicked smile.

My jaw dropped. Before I could react, my duplicate had entered the exam room. The door was locked; the test was about to begin. Its results, however, were suddenly the last thing on my mind. I needed to find Brett. I needed to know what the hell was going on.

Brett wasn’t in the dining hall where I’d left him, or in the rec center where he usually spent Friday mornings, knocking a ping–pong ball around and swapping stories with his fraternity brothers. Our dorm room was the last place I considered checking, and by the time I entered the lobby, over two hours had passed. For better or worse, the exam was over.

Lydia, the front desk worker, stood up as I approached the stairs; I saw her every Friday, yet for some reason she suddenly wanted to inspect my student I.D. I fished my wallet out of my pocket and held it out to her; she examined the plastic card, suspicious.

*Sir,* she informed me, *this I.D. expired in 1997. Dorms are for current students only. I’m going to have to ask you to leave.* Her hand inched toward the phone on her desk. She was afraid of me, I realized; she was getting ready to call security! While I backed away, doing my best to look non-threatening, I glanced down at my I.D.

I didn’t recognize anything about the person I saw. Not the blurry photo, the date of birth, the address–nothing. That wasn’t all: my hands, too, were different. *How could I have overlooked it before?!* They were tanned and hairy, with bitten-off nails and a worm-like white scar that I couldn’t remember ever getting.

I rushed to the nearest public restroom I knew of, the one on the first floor of the Student Services Building. Even though I already suspected what I would find when I looked into the mirror, the shock of it was so great that I nearly passed out. I gripped the edges of the sink, staring helplessly at the reflection of a complete stranger. 

*Who was I?* 

*And who–or what–had taken my place?*

There was a computer lab near the lobby: even if my physical identity had been stolen, I still had my login information, and I could use it to research the person who I had somehow become. I punched in the data from the stranger’s student I.D. 

*Terrance Whitt.* 

*Born: July Eighth, 1976.* 

*Billing Address: Nashville, Tennessee.*

It was immediately clear to me that Terrance Whitt was a missing person. He had been twenty-one years old when he’d vanished from the university library one foggy spring night. The security cameras had captured Terrance entering the building, but not leaving it, and online forums I read were full of strangers speculating about what might have happened.

Some suspected that he had gotten lost in the library’s maze-like basement–which was under construction at the time–and that his corpse had been entombed in its walls; others argued that Terrance must have been deep into the university’s drug culture and had wound up owing money to the wrong people.

I had my own theory about why Terrance Whitt had gone missing…and it had *everything* to do with the Gift-Giver. I looked down at Terrance’s face–*my face*–on the worn-out college I.D. 

*Terrance…you poor bastard…what gift were you after?*

The Whitts had posted a phone number for tips or information about their son’s disappearance, and even though the website hadn’t been updated since the early 2000’s, I figured I didn’t have anything to lose by calling it. 

I was shocked when someone picked up on the third ring.

The old woman on the other end of the line was Terrance’s mother, and she had kept the number open even after all these years. I sputtered, suddenly remembering that I needed to provide information of my own before I asked any questions. I quickly asked if Terrance had a small white scar on his left hand. His mother’s response was so hopeful and excited it hurt. *Yes!* She shouted. *Have you seen him?*

I told her that I thought I *might* have, but I needed to know something first: did she have any idea about why her son might have wanted to disappear? Anything that was bothering him at the time?

*You know,* Mrs. Whitt said finally, *you’re the first person to call this number in over thirteen years. I suppose there’s no harm in telling you. Terrance…didn’t want to leave that university. He wanted to stay in school and finish his PhD, but my husband–God rest his soul–demanded that he come home to take over the family business. You…you don’t think that could have anything to do with his disappearance…do you?*

I muttered that I had to go, that I would call back when I knew more. Mrs. Whitt’s voice was still ringing in my ears, and I could already imagine how it might have gone:

*Terrance, bitter and disillusioned, is roaming aimlessly through the library. There’s hardly anyone here this late at night. The fluorescent lights hum overhead. The ugly gray carpet muffles his footsteps.*

*Someone clears their throat on the other side of the shelves.* 

*A stranger’s voice whispers to him through a gap in the books.*

*It tells Terrance that he can stay at the university after all, if only he follows a few simple instructions.* 

*Wouldn’t that be a lovely gift?*

A security guard was watching me suspiciously through the computer lab windows. As he muttered something into his radio, I hurried out the back entrance. I headed for the park at the center of the university: I didn’t *think* that campus police were actively searching for me, but if they were, it would be a good place to lose them. 

The park was a bowl-shaped ravine crisscrossed by paths, most of them half-hidden by bushes, rows of gnarled old trees, and the walls of a large amphitheater. The leaves had fallen weeks ago, but there was still enough cover to pass by unobserved…I hoped.

This late on a Friday afternoon, the park was almost completely empty. On a bench up ahead, however, I spotted two figures: a boy and a girl. Their heads were pressed together as though they were having an intimate conversation, but the closer I got, the more wrong the situation looked. The girl leaned her body nervously away from the boy, who had a white-knuckle grip on her wrist. He was holding her in place, and while I wasn’t sure what he was muttering into her ear, it was clear that she didn’t like it.

When I saw the boy’s face, I understood that no matter how much time passed, I would never get used to the feeling of seeing my own body under something else’s control. With horror, I realized that I recognized the girl as well: Raquel. I had had a crush on her since Freshman year, but had never worked up the courage to talk to her. 

*Just think about what will happen if you refuse,* my duplicate hissed into her ear. *What would your parents think if they found out? You don’t want me as your enemy…*

I forced myself to stop and ask the couple if everything was alright. My own face glared angrily up at me and for a second, and I would have sworn that my duplicate’s eyes went inky black. It was like staring into two lightless pits, and from the way Raquel screamed, I was sure that she had seen it, too.

*Get away from me, you freak!* She shouted, then fled down the trail. My duplicate stood, cracked its neck…then punched me in the stomach. 

The wind went out of my lungs. I doubled over in the damp grass, gasping for air. My duplicate knelt beside me and pressed my face into the dirt. 

*This is my life now, MINE, and you’re never getting it back. Understand?*

It snarled. I couldn’t breathe. My mouth filled with the reek of mud and rotting leaves… 

*HEY!* Someone shouted, and the weight on my back disappeared. Running footsteps approached; I spat black muck into the grass.

It was the security guard from the Student Services Building. The bulky older man hauled me to my feet, dusted me off, and asked if I was alright. Once he’d confirmed that I wasn’t going to die in his custody, he pointed to the parking lot that marked the edge of the university.

*I’ve had my eye on you for a while,* he grunted. *You’ve been nothing but trouble ever since you showed up, and if I see you around here again I´m gonna detain you for trespassing. Are we clear?* 

I nodded; I didn’t have much choice.

With no money and no way of proving who I really was, I could only wander the chilly, gray streets until sunset. Around twilight, the sound of wailing sirens made me look toward the liquor store at the edge of campus. A red-faced, bellowing student was being dragged through its doors by four police officers. *It was Brett!* 

By the time I'd jogged up to the liquor store, my roommate had already been taken away. The store owner and a cashier were still outside, having a smoke and shaking their heads. With a sinking feeling in my gut, I approached and asked them what had happened. The owner–a grizzled old man in a white apron–said that he had never seen anything like it.

Apparently, Brett had stumbled into the store fifteen minutes earlier, rambling about how he needed *‘more.’* He had unscrewed a bottle of whiskey, chugged it, and then did the same to the next one. By the time the cashier realized what was going on, Brett had polished off five without a single sign of drunkenness. When the owner tried to stop him, he shattered a bottle and threatened them with its jagged edges…and *still* he kept drinking. Even after the police tackled and cuffed him, Brett was still fighting to lick a few last drops of alcohol from the floor. His tongue, shredded by broken glass, had left a bloody smear across the filthy tiles.

If Brett died on the way to the hospital, it would probably be attributed to alcohol poisoning, but I knew better. His *‘gift,’* like mine and Terrance’s, was  twisted from the beginning. He may have wanted a cool party trick, but what he had gotten was something dangerous, something that had to be *fed.* I felt certain that if Brett couldn't feed his gift, it would consume him instead. *And what about my so-called ‘gift’? What was my duplicate using my name and my body to do, even now?*

Somehow, I had to find the Gift-Giver for a second time.

I returned to campus under cover of darkness, and by two AM, I had circled the entire university three times. My legs ached, my eyelids were heavy, and I could see my breath in the frosty air. I was halfway through a parking-lot underpass when I heard the tap of an umbrella on the concrete behind me. I turned slowly, and in the yellowish glow of the underpass’ solitary light, I saw the Gift-Giver face-to-face for the first time.

Where his eyes, ears, and nose should have been were only empty pits. His awkward movements, I realized, were caused by his bent-backwards limbs. Even so, he was fast: faster than should have been possible. The light flickered, I blinked, and suddenly his face was mere inches from mine. 

*What's wrong?* He rasped through graying, empty gums. *You don't like your gift?*

I bit down a scream; the Gift-Giver made a horrible gurgling noise that might have been a giggle. *You can give it back, you know. As long as you do a favor for me in return…*

Forcing my lips to move again, I asked the Gift-Giver what he wanted. 

*Oh, that's easy. I want you to kill me.*

My jaw dropped. 

*See that concrete brick over there? Smash it into my skull. Again and again and again, until there's nothing left. Do that, and your duplicate will disappear. You’ll be yourself again. Do we have a deal?*

I hesitated: the Gift-Giver was literally asking me to commit murder…and what was the catch in his new offer? Would I get my body back, only to spend the rest of my days rotting in prison? Or would the consequences of returning my gift be something even worse, something unimaginable?

I thought about spending the rest of my days in Terrence Whitt's body, forced to do nothing but watch while my duplicate committed horrors using my name, my face, and my reputation. I thought about my parents, about the padded cell where I would be locked up if I ever tried to tell anyone the truth. Nothing could be worse than that…*could it?*

I could see the brick the Gift-Giver was talking about, surrounded by slimy puddles and trash. It seemed to have its own gravity…it seemed to be calling to me. I swallowed; my throat was dry. I told the Gift-Giver to turn around.

I lifted the brick in my hand and took a deep breath. As long as I didn’t think about what I was doing, it was no different than hammering in a nail or tenderizing a slab of meat. The Gift-Giver had *asked* me to do this, I reminded myself…and then I swung.

He went down the moment the sharp edge cracked against his skull, but I didn’t stop. I shut my eyes tight, gritted my teeth, and smashed the brick into his head until I didn’t have the strength to lift it anymore. A sick burbling sound made me look down.

The Gift-Giver was…*laughing*…and that wasn’t all. Something was moving beneath his skin. No, that wasn’t right: his flesh itself was changing, reshaping itself into the form of someone else. Someone who I thought I recognized. I rolled the Gift-Giver’s corpse over with the tip of my shoe… and looked down at the ruined face of Terrance Whitt. 

It didn't make sense. *If Terrance Whitt had been the Gift-Giver all along, then where had the legend come from?*

Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked. Terrance Whitt’s body was a gory mess, I was holding the murder weapon, and a witness could come along at any time. What mattered now was distancing myself from the scene and washing away the evidence. The bloodstains weren’t obvious on my dark jacket; they could have been anything…and I had my doubts that the stuff was even blood at all. The oily black liquid that had splattered from the Gift-Giver’s wound was thick and viscous; it seemed to sink into my clothes and skin rather than dripping off of them. With a shudder, I wiped away what I could and hurried back to my dorm.

Fifteen minutes later, I was crossing the threshold of the lobby. It felt like a moment of truth. Behind the front desk, Lydia looked up from her computer and gave me a small smile. *She had recognized me!* It was all the proof I needed that I was truly myself again.

I left my filthy clothes on the floor of my room, wrapped up in a towel, and hurried down the hallway to the bathroom. The communal showers always smelled like mold, bleach, and too much cologne, but that night, they felt like heaven. Beneath the hot water, I felt reborn. Tomorrow would be a new day. I could finally put this nightmare behind me.

My confidence lasted only as long as it took me to dry off, change into my pajamas, and return to my lightless dorm room. The clothes that I had piled on the floor were gone. In their place was a gray silk suit, a black umbrella, and a pair of polished shoes. I clamped a hand over my mouth. I felt a tooth wiggle loose, and then fall out. I finally understood the deal I had made with Terrance Whitt, the same deal that *he* must have made with the Gift-Giver before him. 

It’s just a matter of time now. I can feel my eyes sinking into their sockets, my elbows and knees beginning to bend in the wrong direction. There has always been a Gift-Giver on this campus–

*and there always will* [be](http://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)*.*

1khz8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1khz8cn/need_some_insight_on_a_personal_concern_regarding/,Need some insight on a personal concern regarding my heart,"Hello all. I am a FTM trans individual. I am 32 years old. I am on a few medications such as: asenapine, Wellbutrin, Zyrtec, biotin, vitamin D, buspar, hydroxyzine, verapamil, prazosin, prilosec, and testosterone. I am very obese and currently working with a dietician and my PCP to change that. I have anxiety, depression, PTSD, acid reflux, and high blood pressure. I was recently (Tuesday 5/6) diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I also struggle with seasonal allergies. I also have a tumor on my parotid gland. Lately I’ve also been experiencing (unknown cause - waiting for GI referral) rectal bleeding. I don’t know if that’s related but thought I’d throw it out there. 

October - November 2024: I was extremely ill with pneumonia and was in ICU for 2 weeks and almost died. While in the hospital they found a PFO in my heart. They told me that they’re usually not dangerous and 1 in 4 people have a PFO. They believe my pneumonia got so bad because of my PFO as my bubble tests resulted in a lot of activity and it was raising some concerns. They decided to wait until my pneumonia was clear before really worrying about it though.

January 2025: I am almost completely healed of pneumonia with very little “crackling” in my lungs. I see a cardiologist and they want an echocardiogram completed. 

March 2025: I have another bubble test completed. Same results as last time. Now the cardiologist I saw wants me to see another cardiologist specialist who specializes in closing PFOs to determine if closure is necessary. My appointment was scheduled for June 11, 2025. 

Today (May 8, 2025): My appointment for next month was canceled today. I called to get a reason why and they just said the doctor wasn’t in which is fine but I need an appointment and I’m worried it’s going to be a few more months til I get to have this appointment. No appointment was made at the time of the phone call because they were going to see what they could do for a sooner appointment. 

Recently (about two weeks now) I’ve been having shortness of breath. I cannot get a deep breath and it’s so frustrating because it seems all my body wants is that deep breath. I saw my PCP (last Friday 5/2) and she detected a slight murmur in my heart. There is 0 crackling in my lungs though. Today (and this could genuinely be anxiety), I’m experiencing some heaviness on my chest. Like there’s a weight there. I’m also experiencing excessive yawning which was one of the symptoms I had before the pneumonia got really bad. 

My question is: what is going on with me? Within the last year my health has declined and since I turned 32 (1 month ago), it’s gotten worse. Recently I started my dieting journey (literally this week - met with dietician on Monday 5/5) so I don’t believe that’s playing a factor but who knows. My food consumption before was awful. 1 meal a day, usually a soda at dinner, and unhealthy snacks throughout the day. I’m also an avid coffee drinker but I have cut back in the last two weeks. I now only drink 20 ounces throughout the day. 

If someone could give me insight, I’d really appreciate it. Thank you so much if you’ve made it this far!",1,1746733368.0,AskDocs,3,0.67,False

I’ve started logging my food intake and have started going to the gym. I want advice on if I’m overexercising/undereating, or if it’s just my watch and calorie app giving me wrong information. I exercised yesterday doing elliptical in the gym for about 1h 30 min, plus 150 repeats of abs exercises (it was core day, trying to keep it focused on one muscle group a day). The 1h 30 min said it consumed 1000 cal, while I ate overall that day 1950. Are those good rates? Are they even close to what they should be? I expected that after 1000 calories lost in the gym and not eating much more than usual I would feel very tired today, but it feels like I did nothing. Is 1950 calories a lot in this case? (I ate some prosciutto, cheese, tortellini of spinach and ricotta with pesto sauce, and for dinner some lean pork loin, plus a couple of coffees with milk and apples)

I had a crush on a server that’s been working at the lunch spot i gone to for several years so i seen him for and extended period of time. I flirted a bit with him about half a year ago, and then i freaked out and avoided coming in when he was working. I’m very rejection sensitive and i felt embarrest and vulrable and i need peace to digest food and relax lol. So months later i thought he probably forgot so i started to go when he was there again still kind of ”scared” of him. He kept being around me a lot always the one bringing my food and asking to take my plate. We exchanced long stares with wide eyes. He once informed the table right next to mine about a quiz at the bakery beside that was going to start soon when i looked up at him he was staring at me with panic eyes. I still didn’t dare to go since he didn’t ask me directly and there was a chance he didn’t mean it as and invitation to hang out with me. One time when i was coming in i could sense something was up. There is a library in the same building i use to go there and study i vd decided before that i was going to talk to him this time and i was very nervous so i went to the libary first to try to calm myself down. I saw his coworker spying at me there… than i went in and he was sitting on a chair with his back turned against the wall away from the customers behind the desk. It was strange so i kept looking at him trying to figure out what seemed to be a test to see if i liked him.  Later, our eyes met and he made a smile like he was trying to contain laughter he kept trying to hold it back until he couldn’t anymore and started laughing. I felt super uneasy and stressed out and i felt mocked i made a hurt expression. And he stopped with a pityful look on his face before he started to make nose kisses in the air. I made an awkward expression and turned my head to the side while still looking at him from the corner of my eye. He started laughing again. When he walked pass me he kind of smirked and laughed. I tried to confront him about it when he was coming for my plate. Ask why he was laughing at me.  He hesitated and Said he was laughing at something else. I gave him another chance to reasure me that he wasn’t mocking me for liking him and asked if he could explain to me what it was that was so funny? He gave me some bs answer that it was just something that was stuck in his head that he couldn’t get out. When i was at the coffee machine and he was behind me to refill with fresh cups he teased me ”don’t hurry for my sake” which he had done before which i though was cute then but after he laughed it kind of just felt like he was bullying me.

After this i didn’t go there for almost a month i felt humiliated. When i went back i ignored him protecting myself but i quickly noticed that he was super nervous around me he kept stealing glances but looking away quickly. Went passed my table eventhough there was nothing to do there just to say hi. He stuggled to hold eye contact which he previosly had no problem with.  His hair had also started greying and he had eyebags he looked 10 years older and so tired. He was clearly going through something i wasn’t just going to assume it was because of me though lol. I stayed there to study and when they were almost closing i went passed him made eyecontact he quickly came to my table to inform me they were closing soon. Than i poped the question asking if we could talk.  His eyes widend and he quickly looked away Said absolutly  while his hands were trembling like crazy with the cups he was handing. I feeling the tension building while he kept trembling with he cups and looking away with an absent look on his face, i felt the need to fill the silence so i just bursed out ”i just want to feel comfortable coming here” he snaped out of his nervous trembling looked at me and Said that he still had work left to do. I Said i was just going to study *implying that i could wait* He repeated that he just wanted to inform me that they were closing soon so i wouldn’t mind steping over the rope. In my anxious state i saw his repeating of the closing as he was asking me to leave. So i said ”ok fine” and went to the library beside.  After calming down in the library i realized he was just nervous and he didn’t mean it like that so i was heading back at sat at the spot i sat before. I saw all his collegues leaving they seemed amused and one collegue was looking at me and smiling. It was dark inside i wasn’t sure if he already went home/left on the other entrence. i was sitting there reading for almost an hour until i had to assume he had left without checking if i was there. There was happeing a lot in my life there were exams and i didn’t have time to go eventhough i wanted to know what happened then easter came so the place was closed, i was busy when i finally went two weeks later he wasn’t there. Then i went again another 2 weeks later on a day i knew he always used to work on and he wasn’t there. So i asked his coworker about him and she informed me he had swiched jobs. I have a sinking feeling he switched Jobs because of me. You can argue that there could be other reasons but he worked there for years and suddlenly switched Jobs just when this happens… I just want some closure.. i want to talk to him just know what happened and why. I hope i wasn’t the reason he quit .. 
but if he wanted contact he atleast ask a coworker to forward his details right .. ",1,1746733080.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1khz450,https://i.redd.it/4yy36r382mze1.jpeg,The Retired Magical Girl,"Let’s get into the first chapter. I want her tired, staring at her medical tablet trying to fight writer block for her theses. 

Absolutely. Here’s Chapter One of Emotions, setting the tone for dark humor, magical burnout, and a 37-year-old woman who just wants to finish her damn thesis:

⸻

Chapter One: In Which Cassandra Fails to Write a Single Damn Sentence

Cassandra Vexley sat cross-legged on the couch, wrapped in a decade-old cardigan that smelled faintly of cinnamon and broken dreams. Her medical tablet balanced precariously on one thigh, the cursor blinking with smug superiority in the empty document titled: “An Ethical Framework for Magical Defence Theory: A Modern Application.”

It was taunting her. She was certain of it.

She took another sip of coffee, which had long gone cold, and stared at the blinking cursor like it owed her money.

“I’ve survived three magical wars, a minor apocalypse, and two weeks trapped in a pocket dimension run by sentient badgers,” she muttered. “But this—this thesis—is where I fall.”

The heating charm on the apartment had fizzled out around 4 a.m., and Cassandra hadn’t bothered fixing it. She was too tired. Not the kind of tired sleep could fix, but the kind that settled into your joints and whispered, You’ve done enough. Let someone else save the world, sweetheart.

Except she wasn’t sure she knew how to be normal. Not really. She’d left the battlefield, sure, but the battlefield hadn’t quite left her. Her left hip still clicked when it rained. Her right eye glowed faintly purple when she was irritated. And she was always irritated.

She rubbed her temple, scrolling up her half-outline, which now read:

Introduction
— Magic: Not Just For Idiots With Wands
— Historical Context of Magical Conflict: An Overview (Probably Delete This?)
— Defence Theory and Moral Ambiguity (I hate this section)
— Stuff About Consent and Incantations (Check phrasing—avoid sounding like a sex cult)

Cass groaned and flopped backward, tablet thunking to the floor. She stared at the cracked ceiling above her and gave serious thought to faking her death and moving to a beach realm where nobody cared about academic citations.

That’s when her pendant—long dormant, buried beneath her sports bra like a guilty secret—began to hum.

She didn’t move. Not yet.

It pulsed once. Then twice. A warm, golden heat that seeped through her skin and into her bones.

“No,” she said aloud to no one. “No. We are not doing this. I have a bibliography due tomorrow and plantar fasciitis. You can go glow up someone else’s life.”

The pendant pulsed again. This time, brighter. Louder. Her tablet vibrated off the floor and slid across the hardwood with an ominous ding. The document auto-saved.

“Okay. Rude.”

With the heavy weight of someone who knew this exact magical bullshit was inevitable, Cass sat up, grabbed the pendant from beneath her shirt, and held it in her palm. It shimmered with the swirling gold of old promises and newer regrets.

Then, without warning, the air split open with a spark of lavender lightning—and Kevin, her long-lost talking emotional support cat, materialized in a puff of magical glitter and general disdain.

He blinked. “You look like hell.”

“I’m thirty-seven and surrounded by idiots,” Cass said. “What’s your excuse?”

He stretched, licked one paw, and smirked. “The Emotional Realms are collapsing. You’re being reinstated. Congratulations, General Vexley.”

Cass groaned.

And this time, it wasn’t just the thesis that was doomed.

1khz3ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1khz3ey/aitah_for_wanting_stayathome_spouse_to_do_more/,AITAH for wanting stay-at-home spouse to do more housework?,"First ever Reddit post, and it’s a long one. Need unbiased marriage advice because my friends and family always take my side. 

  Background: I (30s F) and my husband (30s M) have been married 5 years, together for 10. We’ve had a great relationship so far, but the last 4 ish years have been rougher due to his unemployment. We did a big move for my job 4 yrs ago, and since then he has been unable to find work. He got a second degree during the years of unemployment, so he tried but still no luck. I’ve been thankfully able to support both of us due to my full time job (45hrs a wk, just barely making 6 figures). We don’t have or want kids. 
 
  Since he’s unemployed, he does the cooking almost every day, he does 80-90% of the dishes, floors, trash, lawn mowing (very infrequently needed), 100% of grocery shopping… that’s all I can think of. He’s fine with doing these things. However. 

  I do 100% of the laundry, bathroom cleaning, feed the dogs morning and night, make coffee in the morning. Usually do dishes on the weekend when I’m home. Cook a few times a month. Definitely not as much as he does. 

  I’ve been finding myself doing more and more dishes lately, cleaning/tidying more around the house more. I get home from work and there’s dishes on the counter instead of in the sink or dishwasher. Or he does the dishes but won’t wipe down the counter. He refuses to put his clothes in the hamper. Clutter all over the place because he won’t put things away where they go. If I put stuff away he gets mad that he can’t find things. 

  I feel like I shouldn’t have to do as much chores because he’s home 24/7 playing video games while I work 8-9 hr days with a 45min commute 5 days a week. I guess I just want him to put more effort in to keep the house nice, but his idea of “clean” is way different from mine. We’ve talked about a few of these issues, and his response is usually something along the lines of since I’m not the one doing the chore I don’t get a say in how it’s done. 

I don’t want to divorce or anything like that, outside of these issues our relationship is great, but how can I bring a productive conversation about this up? I feel the resentment building. Sometimes I feel like I’d have less work to do if it was just me even with working all the time, since I wouldn’t have him making more messes to clean up. I need fair advice. Thanks.

1khz39h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1khz39h/i_asked_the_lady_at_starbucks_out_by_accident/,I asked the lady at Starbucks out by accident,"About a year ago, I (39m) went to the US for the first time, Chicago to be precise. I’m not a big coffee drinker, but I wanted to try an American Starbucks.

I go to this place near my hotel, and there’s a cute barista, probably late 20s, at the counter. She had this super cute smile, and was very friendly. So she hears my accent and we start making small talk.

In the UK I usually ask what time people finish work, especially if they say it’s been a long day. So I asked her what time she got off work. She looked at me funny, like I was asking more than I was asking. And so did her colleagues who I didn’t realise were paying attention.

She tells me her shift finishes at 3pm. And I’m like that’s not so bad. Then I say “see you later.” Which is UK for bye. She’s smiling at me as I leave, and she says see you later.

My cousin in North Carolina calls to ask how my day is. I tell him about Starbucks. He immediately starts laughing and he tells me not to ask women what time they get off work in America. 

Apparently I may have accidentally asked her out. I avoided that coffee shop for the rest of my trip, I felt so embarrassed.

1khz2ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1khz2ql/4_years_no_marketing_real_product_still_standing/,"4 Years, No Marketing, Real Product — Still Standing   {i will not promote}","Hey r/startups,

I'm the founder of **CAV Solutions**, and four years ago we — a small team from Estonia — set out to build something real:  
a plug-and-play age verification module for vending machines.

**Picture this:**  
A vending machine that sells alcohol, vapes, CBD — or even operates as a 24/7 pharmacy — and our device instantly checks that the buyer is 18+ with no staff required.

We raised a small angel round and made the classic mistake:  
we poured almost everything into R&D.  
Our first prototype was wildly buggy — at our first trade show, it wouldn’t even connect to Wi-Fi. We had to buy a hotspot and spoof our office SSID just to demo it.

Then came our first customers, followed by sleepless nights of debugging, support, data collection, design iterations, planning, and rework.

Angel funds ran dry long ago.  
We opened a seed round and reached out to over 300 VCs and angels — only to hear “Not a fit” every time.  
After that, we stopped chasing investors and doubled down on finding customers and driving sales.

So here we are — after 2 years of MVP (V1) development and early sales, plus another year of refinement — and we’ve finally delivered a stable, production-grade product:  
**Strict AI Verifier (V2)**, fully compliant with **ISO/IEC 27566** standards.  
No marketing. No sales team. Just four people building, testing, iterating, surviving.

**But the product works.**  
Our system supports over 5,000 different IDs, driver’s licenses, and passports from around the world.  
It’s already live in real vending machines — primarily in the U.S.  
Selling without marketing is brutal, so we began charging early adopters for V2 upgrades (we couldn’t afford to offer them for free).  
A surprising number said yes — and many even ordered additional units.

**We’ve learned our device fits far beyond vending:**

* It could sit at a school entrance and block unauthorized entry.
* It could integrate with self-checkout kiosks, pharmacies, clubs, and airports via a simple API. *(We’ve even joked it could turn a home coffee machine into a smart, age-restricted payment terminal.)*

Over the past year, we’ve started getting inbound requests from Europe — we had almost zero before, so that’s encouraging.

We’ve probably cycled through every emotion — from excitement to despair and back again.

**Next on our roadmap:**  
Integration with **Apple Wallet** and **Google Pay**.  
Currently, all user data is deleted immediately after verification, although some clients have asked for an optional “remember me” feature — so returning customers can be fast-tracked by face alone.  
We're planning to add that — and then tie a **bank or crypto wallet** to a face, so customers can pay with **face + PIN**.

**But for now, we’re just trying to stay alive and grow.**

# What we’ve learned after 4 years:

1. **Clients stick if you solve a real problem.**
   * One customer started with a single unit and now runs 30+.
   * Another returned after a rough V1 test, tried V2 — and instantly bought 5, then 15 more.
2. **Inbound leads convert.**
   * About 50% of companies who contact us via the site order within a week.
   * Another 30% return within 1–2 months.
3. **Without marketing, we’re invisible.**
   * We’re still entirely bootstrapped, selling a dozen units per month, no paid ads — just persistence.

# What’s next?

We’re looking to scale in the U.S. and considering two paths:

1. **Exclusive, state-level distributors**, each committing to a minimum monthly volume.
2. **Selling a stake in our U.S./Canada business** to a partner — company, investor, or entrepreneur — who sees the potential to build a standalone enterprise.

If you know someone in CBD vending, automated retail, or pharmacy automation — or an investor/entrepreneur looking for a ready-to-scale hardware solution — **feel free to drop me a note**.

**P.S.** If you’re just starting out, here are 3 lessons we learned the hard way:

1. **Sell from day one.** Even if your product is raw, get it in customers’ hands, gather feedback, then iterate.
2. **Don’t wait for perfect.** It never will be “fully ready.”
3. **Hire sales early.** We didn’t — and that was our biggest misstep.",1,1746732974.0,startups,6,1.0,False

1khz1gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1khz1gf/jimmy_stewart_impersonator_seeking_advice/,Jimmy Stewart Impersonator Seeking Advice,"Since I graduated college a couple years ago, I’ve been working as the main barista at this small cafe. The cafe is inside a clothing store, and it’s really only there to make the store itself look cooler and to get people in the door and buying the expensive clothing. It’s pretty quiet most of the time, so I get some freedom when it’s slow to read and try and write. It’s not stressful, but there’s a lot of annoying corporate shit tied to the store. Also, this store is a center of this yuppie subculture in town that I really can’t stand. My friends will come in from time to time, but mostly the people who I’m seeing every day are middle age men who are caught up in a niche dick-measuring contest. I don’t get paid well.

Now, there’s another coffee shop just next door. This place would pay better and it would be a lot more busy. It’s a real coffee shop, not just a little bar inside of a clothing store. As such, there’s different kinds of people that come in - for better and for worse. There’s young people, and there’s families, and influencers working from home, and old people with nothing better to do than to yell at the employees. It would be nice to get paid a little more, to work in a place that’s a bigger center for the community, but I also know I’ll have less freedom to do nothing. There won’t be that time where I pull out my book and read while no one’s there. I can’t sneak my friends free coffees and beers we have in the back.

All I want is to be able to give coffee to the friends who come in, and meet new people who like the same shit I like. I don’t care about working my way up in the coffee world or anything like that.

The question touches on a conversation I have with my friends all the time. Our town kinda sucks. The people who move here tend to have a lot of money and no taste. There’s a few of us who stayed after college for one reason or another, but mostly the demographic seems to be 35+, making a shit ton of money in a remote job, and trying to keep things exactly how they are. But the longer I stay here the more cool people I meet, people who also want to leave, but get sucked in by this little micro community of outsiders that exist here. The longer these folks stay here, the bigger the chance that we can create the community we want to see in this town. I think this job thing is the same. The place I’m at now kinda sucks. The new place will suck as well probably. But here, I get the chance to try and mold the community I want to see. I probably can’t do that at the new place as much. But maybe I can.

My husband, ""Toby"" and I met in 2018 when we were 27. We were only dating for a couple months when he moved in. He was great, so sweet, thoughtful, helpful, kind.. and I fell in love hard. We got engaged after only 7 months, we did the whole ""when you know you know"" justification.. anyways, hindsight is 20/20.

We got married near our one year together anniversary in 2019. It was only two months in when I got pregnant with our daughter ""Suzie"", we moved in with my parents to save money, and luckily we did as the world shut down when I was 6 months pregnant. I had to have a c section, this is important later. Due to that time in history, when I was on maternity leave, Toby was also off work, we spent the entire first year of Suzies life off together every day. When she was about six months old, we moved into the townhouse I am still in. 

The bickering started around then, little things would set him off and I started walking on eggshells. We would fight over money, personal time, division of housework, parenting, everything... I chalked it up to being around each other every day all day.
When I went back to work, I started a new job and excelled at it. I started making a lot more money and quickly became the breadwinner. I got him a job where I worked and he slacked off and changed jobs after 6 months (I hadn't noticed that he frequently changed jobs every 6 to 9 months until much later).
 
We were more like roommates at this point, miserable roommates who slept in the same bed. He frequently demanded alone time, I was happy to oblige because he was always so miserable to us, it gave my daughter and I time to be able to be ourselves. 

We, by a miracle because it was only once in 5 months, got pregnant with my son ""Frank"" in early 2022. During my pregnancy, I had a lot of issues, my body was not doing well with pregnancy, we fought constantly and the stress was so bad that I had to go on sick leave a month before my due date. It was to the point that I could barely sit, had a hard time standing, could hardly walk and laying down was agony - he was more helpful than before, but he would frequently guilt trip me and make me feel like I owed him and should worship him for doing everything for me.

I had my second c section at the beginning of 2023. 10 days after I had Frank, Toby was yelling at me (I have a recording), that I no longer have an excuse, I'm no longer pregnant, I need to get off my a$$ and contribute to the house, to clean, cook and do laundry. I started recording all of his tangents because he would gaslight me that he didn't say that, I didn't hear him right, I'm crazy.

Money was tight while I was on maternity leave, he had switched jobs and worked from home, constantly telling me I was lazy because I wouldn't do anything but take care of Frank and Suzie. My post partum depression was so bad, the intrusive thoughts were bad and intense and, looking back, he made it so much worse. I put Suzie in daycare so I could manage Frank easier. A year that was supposed to be magical and beautiful, it was miserable and I hated it. He was cruel and rude all of the time. I ended up going back to work 4 months early, hoping that making more money would lessen our fights because that must be whats causing our issues. I always justified his behavior. This is when it gets messed up.

Time line is important to this, so I'm going to do my best to keep the info organized here, it gets messy..
October 2023, I went back to work, we fought a lot and he avoided hanging out with us on the weekends, he had another new job at this point, working in a family arcade place, this is important. We happily avoided him on the weekends, it was more stressful if he was around anyways.

end of November 2023, I had ordered us a shed and checked the security cameras frequently to see when it arrived so I can run home and move it to the backyard to avoid it getting stolen. One day, I looked on the camera and Toby's car was home - weird because he left when I did and he dropped Suzie and Frank at daycare - I got the app notification confirming that. I called and texted him, no answers, I got worried. I got off work and got the kids, rushed home and he was making dinner - i asked him about being home, he told me he went to work and they said he deserved the day off.. it didn't sit right but arguing didn't feel necessary. That evening his brother, sil and their baby came to stay for the weekend. I couldn't shake the feeling he lied to me, the next morning I called my mom when I ran to get everyone coffee, she said to trust my gut and to check the cameras for time stamps and the other days.. well, I did.  he didn't go to work that entire week, the timing wasn't going to work and coming home, it was dropping the kids and coming straight home.. every single day that week.

I got back to the house with coffee and was fuming. I asked him to come outside and chat. I asked him, he lied, I called him out, he lied again and again..  finally he ended it with me being the reason, he needed some alone time and didn't tell me because I would react like this to him taking time off work. This time his gaslighting didn't work, trust was broken and it had to be repaired. His brother and family left that day, and the next day, my kids and I went out shopping with my mom, giving Toby some space. 

now its December 2023, On our way to her house, I realized I forgot something at home and so we stopped and I ran in. Toby wasn't downstairs but the baby gate was up, odd because I have the babies. I go upstairs, the top baby gate closed.. also odd.. then I noticed he rolled towels at the bottom of our bedroom door.. I was a teenager once, I know how to stop a certain smell from moving to other rooms. 
I opened the door and he was standing at the end of our bed wearing VR headset smoking w33d in our room - where we and our babies sleep - it isn't illegal here but I lost it, not because he was smoking it, but because he didn't do it outside and chose to breath it all over our babies beds. Much much after this happened, my friends point out what else he could be doing - my best guess is watching VR corn and the shock he had was because he thought that was what I would be mad about... anyways, back to the storyline.

I was mad, I left and told him as much. The kids and I went to my mom's for dinner, when I came home that evening, he had moved all of his stuff into his office and locked himself in. Turns out he created a whole room for himself, had a twin bed set up, went through the whole house and put everything he felt was his into the room and locked the door whether he was in there or not. After 2 days I asked him and he said our marriage was over.

Over the next month he would have violent and terrifying outbursts, he wouldn't help with the kids, he'd lock himself in the room, he'd take food and eat in there, there was no dishes left downstairs and a smell was coming from the room. I called his brother and he came from the island and convinced Toby he needed to take a vacation and go stay with them for a week - this was my idea to get him away from the kids and I, I had never been afraid but was now and needed him out. my mom and I got into the room and it was disgusting, we cleaned it up. while he was gone, his brother had him call me daily and he was sweet and kind and apologized and said he wanted to make our marriage work, I agreed he could come home.. it was all a lie, it was worse when he came home. I have audio recordings of him screaming and yelling and threatening the kids and I. I won't get into detail because most of it is a part of our court stuff now.. 

but skipping to Christmas eve, he went to work, I was sick of him locking himself into his room, I changed all of the locking door knobs to non locking ones because our daughter spent an hour crying outside his door while he ignored her, I had decided he wasn't a tenant anymore and he needed to contribute to parenting and everything else, or leave.

the kids and I went to my mom's for Christmas eve, when Toby got off work, I knew, because that's when the phone calls came. he screamed - screamed at me that I would regret removing his lock, that I dont deserve privacy, that he needs it and I need to stay out of his room - he said he went and got a lock and that I can do the whole magic of Christmas by myself and I'd be lucky if I ever saw him outside that room again. needless to say, I was choked. I went home and snuck out all the presents for the kids, got us clothes and what we needed and the kids and I spent the night at my parents house and did Christmas morning there. I had texted him informing him and said he could come if he didn't start a fight.. anyways, he ended up moving out December 28th and stayed with his brother for a few weeks while he looked for a place.

January through July 2024 I essentially forced him to spend time with our kids, I had gone to court without him (he didn't reply to being served, its a thing that because he didn't bother doing paperwork, he didn't get to go), I got a really good order from the judge which included a conduct order because I showed her texts and videos he sent meant for the kids badmouthing me.
now this is where it truly goes off the rails...

July 2024, we had been getting along quite well for a few weeks and he invited me to go with him and the kids to visit his family on the island, it didn't go great and we fought and, without going into detail, he broke the conduct order by calling me horrible things in front of our kids. I put in an application for enforcement for the conduct order and had him served. 

meanwhile, I had found my old tablet while cleaning up the house to turn Toby's old office into a room for Frank. I charged it up and turns on, Toby's Gmail was logged in. I got nosy and noticed there was current photos, I scrolled, and scrolled and what I found made me rage. 

There were photos, so many photos.. some of his junk (while we were married - you only really take those to send to people and he sure wasn't sending them to me), photos of him trying toys in his umm rear... photos of him in women's underwear.. so many photos.. but none of those sent me into my rage.. it was the photos of his SIL, while holding his brothers hand and her baby, of her rear end zoomed in and cropped in some photos, there were some of our daughters soccer coach, with Suzie cropped out thank God, there was our cleaner, my tattoo artist, some patrons of the arcade he worked at.. all of their rear ends and all from Jan 2023 (when I had our son) until current.. I documented it and moved on. 

I had a tattoo appointment with my friend, who was in the photos, later that week - I told her about them and we laughed, gross but whatever right? then her husband laughed and suggested he posted them on some ""public butt"" reddit forum and I should check the reddit on the tablet.

well folks, if you're still here, I apologize for the length and thank you for sticking it out, because it all honestly needs to get off my chest.. here's the thing..
I didn't see any of the photos I had found. instead, I found candid photos he took of my mother in her house while she was changing our then newborn daughter (dated 4 years ago) - of her face and cleavage. they had titles that still makes my body shake with rage. the worst of the six posts said ""I'd like to come all over these tots"" with certain words spelled differently for censor sake. 

I documented and deleted them but maaaan I was angry. I confronted him via text. his response? ""how did you find these, where did you get these, I feel so exposed"".. A few times since I found them, he tried to tell me they didn't exist, they do - I have them in a secure folder on my phone and my lawyer has them incase the divorce goes sideways. I never got an explanation about any of the photos and I likely never will. I'm sure he cheated on me but at this point, would it even matter? 

over the next few months we would continue our custody battle with me trying to organize and get things sorted and him ignoring me and weaponizing incompetence. I have filed for divorce, I currently have the kids 99% because ""his schedule doesn't work to have them"" and moving in with his girlfriend and changing jobs for the third time since we split has made it hard for him to give them time.

I plan on moving on with my life with the nicest guy I've ever met, who adores my kids and wants them around however much we can. 
court is imminent but I'm confident because Toby has made it clear where his priorities are. he doesn't pay child support still but there's a government program to enforce so I dont have to chase him, I dont really have to even deal with him at this point because the parenting time we have in writing doesn't work for him so he has to request taking them, which I would never prevent it, but he simply doesn't try to see them and I'm done forcing it. 

anyways- my life is good now, I'm happy and excited for life with my kids, my career and my new man. thanks for reading!",3,1746732723.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

The New Bath Guide (1766) Letter 13 ‘A Public Breakfast’ Christopher Anstey 1724–1805 English writer

Thomas Mann 1875–1955 German novelist

1 Unsere Fähigkeit zum Ekel ist, wie ich anmerken möchte, desto grösser, je lebhafter unsere Begierde ist, das heisst: je inbrünstiger wir eigentlich der Welt und ihren Darbietungen anhangen.

Our capacity for disgust, let me observe, is in proportion to our desires; that is in proportion to the intensity of our attachment to the things of this world. The Confessions of Felix Krull (1954) pt. 1, ch. 5 (translated by Denver Lindley)

‘Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention?’ ‘To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.’ ‘The dog did nothing in the night-time.’ ‘That was the curious incident,’ remarked Sherlock Holmes. The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894) ‘Silver Blaze’

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 1859-1930

Religious teaching, that is, the explanation of the purpose and meaning of life, should be the basis of any education. People think that it is no crime to lie to children, and that to lie to children is not really very wrong, but even sometimes necessary. But it is clear that with children you should be especially careful and honest about what you say to them.

Tolstoy, A Calendar of Wisdom

The life of the nation is secure only while the nation is honest, truthful, and virtuous. speech on the 23rd anniversary of Emancipation in the District of Columbia, Washington DC, April 1885

A voice is a gift; it should be cherished and used, to utter fully human speech if possible. Powerlessness and silence go together.

‘A Disneyland of the Soul’ in Toronto Arts Group for Human Rights The Writer and Human Rights (1983) MARGARET ATWOOD, 1939-

Nothing great is created suddenly, anymore than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen. EPICTETUS

All true spiritual development takes place little by little. From day to day you seem to make no progress, but when you glance back to the year before, though you have vastly farther to go, you realize that your nervous system is more resilient, your will stronger, your senses more responsive, your mind and relationships more secure; your goal is that much clearer before your eyes. It is not very helpful to ask, “Why am I not making much progress? Why are there still so many difficulties in my way? Why can’t I surmount them?” It takes time and labor, but the tree will bear fruit. EKNATH EASWARAN

On those remote pages [of the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge] it is written that animals are divided into (a) those that belong to the Emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c) those that are trained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fabulous ones, (g) stray dogs, (h) those that are included in this classification, (i) those that tremble as if they were mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a very fine camel's hair brush, (l) others, (m) those that have just broken a flower vase, (n) those that resemble flies from a distance.

Between ‘God exists’ and ‘There is no God’ lies a whole enormous field which a true sage has great difficulty in crossing.

Our partners are supportive of our ""relationship""

We've been doing this for about 2 years now and I feel like...I don't even know. 

Our partners have both been supportive and are comfortable with us having a regular relationship.

Yet, we've never gone on a date, we've went for coffee maybe twice.  We only have 1 location to see each other (outside of dinner with my family [partners and my kids] a few times a month) and, it's literally a parking lot in the car, for maybe 30 minutes at a time here or they when their schedule can fit it in and it's only days they already planning on going to that location anyway.  
As far as talking goes, it's fine-ish. Here and there throughout the day via text,  when it fits into their schedule. I understand we both have seperate lives,  partners, etc... But, we have nothing set or scheduled for us and, I feel like I'm very much just on the side when there is time. 
I brought this up a few times and they usual says that their schedule is already very tight and they try when they can and I get that but at the same time, this is a relationship they wanted as well and I feel like our time should be respected as well. 
They say their partner is supportive and comfortable with us but,  if so... why keep us in what feels like shadows? 
Does their partner actually know?
Are they not as comfortable as they say?

He's always very involved and connected when we are together. Very loving. When we do talk and see each, it definitely feels very real then.

He always has a reason for everything being,  either his schedule, his partner having metal health issues or,  ""we should be halt for what we have""

I don't know,  maybe I'm expecting too much? 
Lately it's been a trigger of jealousy for me and, I'm questioning a lot of things.

1khyqt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1khyqt2/how_does_the_chulux_professional_espresso_machine/,How does the CHULUX Professional Espresso Machine perform? A detailed review,"The **CHULUX LC-EM335010-DG** espresso machine has been part of my daily routine for a few weeks now, and I’m finally ready to dive into all the things I’ve learned while testing it. This sleek **semi-automatic espresso maker** managed to shake things up in my kitchen with its promises of rich espressos, bold designs, and some genuinely thoughtful features. While I can’t say every moment with it has been perfect, there’s a lot to like—and a few quirks to consider.

**The Design: Compact and Modern**  
Living in a smaller apartment, I’m always on the lookout for kitchen gadgets that save counter space without looking cheap. This espresso machine fits neatly into my limited kitchen real estate at just 5.5 inches wide. Its modern black metallic finish is surprisingly attractive, and honestly, it complements the rest of my kitchen appliances. It’s lightweight too, so moving it around isn’t a workout. The narrow design feels a little less stable when you’re locking the portafilter into place, which caught me off guard during my first use. However, with a gentle hand, I quickly got the hang of it and stopped tipping the machine over.

**Performance: The Espresso Output**  
Espresso output is where the rubber meets the road, right? With a 20-bar professional Italian pump and 1350-watt boiler that heats up in about 30 seconds, this machine doesn’t mess around. The first time I made an espresso, I was impressed by how rich and creamy the shot was. The crema? Spot on. The pre-infusion function also makes a noticeable difference, evenly saturating the coffee grounds before the full extraction. While the brew strength overall has been very good, one notable shortfall is the consistency with coarser grounds; finer grinds seem to yield better results.  

**[See CHULUX LC-EM335010-DG deals on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dg8x6481/)**  

**Positives**  
- Compact design ideal for smaller spaces without crowding counters.  
- Heats up in just 30 seconds, perfect for busy mornings.  
- Produces rich espresso with a thick layer of crema.  
- User-friendly with straightforward buttons and functions.  

**The Steam Wand: A Latte Lover's Dream or Nightmare?**  
I’m a sucker for lattes, so the inclusion of a steam wand caught my attention immediately. It creates microfoam that's decent for cappuccinos and lattes, but mastering it took me a little practice. My sister, who once worked as a barista, gave me a quick tutorial which definitely helped. The wand doesn’t swivel as much as more expensive machines, making it a touch awkward to use, but it’s not a dealbreaker. With some patience, I managed to create froth perfect for my homemade latte art…well, “art” is generous, but it tasted good!  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The water tank, though sufficient in capacity at 40 oz, doesn’t sit snugly every time—it occasionally needs extra adjustments.  
- Stability during portafilter lock-in could be better.  
- Steam wand positioning feels slightly rigid and could be more flexible.

**Target Audience: Who’s This Espresso Machine For?**  
This espresso maker seems like a solid win for espresso lovers who are new to brewing at home or anyone not ready to invest in a high-end model just yet. College students, apartment dwellers, and budding home baristas would especially benefit. It’s intuitive and forgiving for beginners, which minimizes the learning curve. However, if you’re the kind of coffee enthusiast who obsesses over precise pressures and temperatures, its simplicity might feel limiting.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this model to competitors in the same price range, I couldn’t help but notice some parallels with similar machines like the Nespresso Essenza Mini. The Essenza generates good espresso without the mess of ground coffee but locks you into using pods, which gets expensive. Machines from Breville like the Bambino Plus have more robust steam wand features, but they come at a higher cost. Where the CHULUX really excels is splitting the difference between price and performance, making it a good choice for most budgets.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering its price point, the value here is undeniable—especially when you think about how much frequent trips to coffee shops can cost. While it’s not without its quirks, you’ll save a bundle compared to grabbing lattes on the go, and the quality is light-years ahead of pod-based machines like Keurig. I’ve already noticed how much less money I’m spending, and it’s hard not to feel smug about it.

1khypkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiction_Stories/comments/1khypkz/my_wife_had_an_affair_with_her_personal_trainer/,My wife had an affair with her personal trainer,"I Rob (27m) have been married to Emily (25f) for 3 years, I thought we were happily married but a revelation changed everything. About a year ago, Emily and I decided we had gotten in a rut, we felt we had let ourselves go a bit, so we decided to join a gym, Emily joined a gym that her friend Stacy (24f) was a yoga instructor at. I joined a gym that was tied to my work and started training in martial arts, I am a senior IT analyst, I work for a major bank. A bit of background I bought our house before the marriage and had several shares in the bank, Emily had some assets from her grandparents, so we decided that it was best to get a pre-nuptial agreement, this of course had an infidelity clause.  Emily works as a kindergarten teacher, she is a lovely caring person, or so I thought. 

6 months ago, I noticed a change in Emily’s behavior, she started going to the gym, at odd hours and was more guarded with her phone. I was starting to feel she was pulling away, I asked Stacy if there was anything going on at the gym, Stacy flirted around the subject, saying she had not seen anything, but that Emily had stopped going to her yoga classes and had started working out with a trainer there. She said he had a reputation for being too familiar with his clients. Not long after I had spoken to Stacy, Emily started love bombing me. She and I started being more intimate. This led to the beginning of the end.  

A month ago, I got sent a photo, from an anonymous source and it was a picture of Emily and her personal trainer out in a club when she was visiting a girlfriend, they were kissing. The next day I went to my attorney and had him start to draw up divorce papers, she had triggered the infidelity clause. I would leave with everything that was mine and she would get nothing. We live in an at fault state so I had to find out as much as I could, so I contacted Stacy and found out the personal trainer was called Phillip (31), I informed Stacy about the photo and she said this could be bad as if he was named as cause in the divorce he would be fired as the gym they work at has a no fraternization rule and it was a 1 strike rule. I told Stacy I literally do not care if he gets fired. He should not be fucking another man's wife.  

I gave my attorney the information I gained from Stacy, I also got hold of Emily’s phone and found messages, photos, and a video of them being intimate together. I sent all of it to myself. I then forwarded it to my attorney. A week later Emily got a phone call, and I saw from her expression that something was wrong. It looked like her world crumbled, she looked at me open mouthed and then started to cry. She hung up and asked me how long I had known? I asked how long I had known what? She said how long had I known about her affair, and I said about a week, I asked what was wrong? The call was from Phillip to inform her that my attorney had sent the photos and videos to his employer, and he had just been terminated. Oh, dear I said and then handed her the divorce papers and told her she needed to leave my house. I went to a friend's house and waited; I went back 2 and a half hours later to see a strange car in my driveway. I walked into my house and saw Phillip on the couch comforting Emily. Phillip got up and was being aggressive, he pushed me, so I punched him and knocked him into the coffee table; you can get out of my house. Emily and Phillip were cursing at me and threatening me with the police. The police officer arrived. He was the aggressor and showed them the security footage. They were happy I acted in a legal manner. They left and must have told Emily as she phoned me screaming. I just said she could talk to my attorney and hung up on her. ",8,1746732073.0,Fiction_Stories,1,1.0,False
1khyp1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1khyp1p/umbra_aeterna_i_per_aspera/,Umbra Aeterna - I: Per Aspera,"“Let me know when you want me to start the countdown to release the magnetic bottle,” Antony sighed out in boredom. He knew how this test would end, just as the last twelve tests in the past thirty years had gone.

“I’ll let you know when my team has completed the necessary calculations to prevent the drive and its payload from reemerging in Saturn’s core.” George said, unbothered by the lack of faith Antony had in their work.

George had spent decades on the AMP Jump project before Antony was recruited to help with power and shielding issues. He had seen and overcome every problem this project could throw at him—until the huge, seemingly insurmountable mountain they were trying to leap over came into view.

A.M.P. Jump stood for Anti-Matter Propelled Jump—in other words, real-life, honest-to-God faster-than-light travel. Not the most surprising development to the Empire after figuring out immortality and faster-than-light communications, but still a big deal. Or at least it was, until the project got bogged down by the unfortunate side effects of jumping.

“Okay, we are ready. Release containment of antiproton and proton plasmas at will.” He told Antony from the other side of Jupiter’s orbit.

George and his clones believed that, while difficult and time-consuming, the problem of transporting mass faster than the speed of causation would be simple. Like ants trying to figure out how to move a ten-gram weight up a flight of stairs—slowly and painfully.

They believed this because, a few decades earlier, the tyranny of light speed had been conclusively circumvented with the discovery of FTL comms. This miracle of science and engineering was made possible by using exotic entangled particles that seemed to rip through the universe and pop up somewhere else, in very specific conditions that could be replicated and standardized. This opened up the Sol system to more efficient, cheap, bandwidth-limited communications—once the hardware was set up.

After years of internal development, George and his clones had developed an energy-hungry method of sending electrons—a particle with mass—from one place to another faster than a photon could make the same trip. While impressive and widely publicized in the Empire, they needed to scale up to use the technology for expansion to other stellar systems within a reasonable timeframe.

Originally, the issue of scale was thought to be just that: scale. More room for protons, atoms, and multicellular organisms. More instantaneous release and use of massive energy. That’s when the real barrier to FTL came into view: many compact and useful forms of information storage were completely scrambled in the translation back into normal spacetime. Magnetic, capacitive, and—most horrifyingly—even protein folds and DNA strands were all scrambled beyond readability.

“Magnetic bottle shut off in three, two, one.” Antony counted after pressing the big red central button.

There was a soft thump in both pressurized cabins on opposite sides of Jupiter, barely audible to the human ear. A tiny, localized ripple in spacetime—one of the many reasons to conduct tests out near Jupiter, where the gravity well could stabilize things and no important property could be damaged.

“Sensors orbiting Saturn picked up post-jump signatures. They have a visual. Jump successful.” George said, hoping Antony’s shields held up and preserved something useful.

“Let’s see the damage.” Antony sighed as he sent in pre-programmed drones from Saturn’s orbit to inspect test materials and his jury-rigged fuse charge delta detector. “It’s gonna take a while for the drones to get to the ship and inspect the samples. Let’s meet up at the station orbiting Europa. There’s a diner I like that should be open by the time we both get there.”

“Sounds good,” George agreed. “It’s gotta work with this new shield configuration. I can just feel it. This time, five years from now, we’ll beat the colony ship on its way to Proxima Centauri.”

Antony settled back in his chair as the drones sped toward the ship. There was nothing more to do but wait.

Several hours and one cramped shuttle ride later, he stepped through the wide glass doors of the Europa Station Diner.

He scoffed. Only an architect could think glass doors made sense on a space station. Just because we have backups now doesn’t mean I welcome the idea of sucking on vacuum.

The diner clung to the edge of the station’s lower ring, all chrome fixtures and low spin gravity-adjusted booths. Bright signs in English and Latin flickered overhead.

Antony spotted George already seated in the back, nursing a steaming mug of synth-coffee.

We still can’t seem to get decent beans out past Mars for cheap. Not worth the increased power draw on station systems for tropical grow lamps, and there’s no real profit in importing them when caffeine crystals are easier to ship.

“You really think this time will be different?” Antony asked as he slid into the booth across from him.

“Of course I do. The last few dry tests of your new shielding system blocked out much more external interference—the kind we know flips bits and disrupts biological processes. It’ll turn out.” George said, waving his hand a bit too dismissively to be believable. “What? You don’t trust your own designs?”

“I trust the results of the dry runs. I just don’t believe we’re able to model the translation environment correctly. How are you so sure the cause is external?” Antony asked, raising an eyebrow at George.

“It just has to be!” he yelled involuntarily, causing Antony to lean back slightly.

*I haven’t seen one of him this agitated in decades*, Antony thought.

At that moment, a non-citizen waitress approached their booth, tablet in hand, ready to take their orders.

Antony offered her a small smile, one she returned a little shyly. 

*Maybe she was one of his descendants.* She had similar dark hair, the same stubborn jawline — little echoes that were easy to imagine, even after so many generations.

""Coffee, black,"" Antony said gently. ""And... whatever meal special you have today.""

George barely glanced up as he ordered, his thoughts clearly still tangled in calculations and half-solved problems.

As she left the table, George continued.

""Look, I’m sorry. I’m just stressed out about the lack of progress on this project. We need this to be possible — we can’t stay in this system.""

""Dark Forest?"" Antony asked.

""Yes, Dark Forest. And it’s not just the noise I’ve been making with the A.M.P. Jump tests that worries me."" George said, sipping his cup. ""The Empire is shading a larger and larger percentage of the Sun every year. May as well advertise to the entire galactic arm that we have a Dyson swarm ready to be annexed.""

""That’s only a problem if complex or artificial life can survive FTL without turning into scrap metal or jello. But yeah, I get it — if we’re figuring it out, odds are someone else already has, and we’re playing catch-up."" Antony said, conceding the point. ""Only one way to find out.""

He pulled a tablet from his bag, scanned through the test logs, and sent a copy to George with a tap.

They went over disappointment after disappointment — data corrupted beyond recognition, biologicals reduced to soup.

As they finished eating, there was one last-minute test left to review. A simple visual confirmation was all that was needed.

All fuses blown — and that could only happen if the potential across all nodes changed simultaneously, meaning a universal shift in charge.

""It's definitely not external. Look at this,"" Antony said, holding out his tablet. ""It's all happening everywhere at once. I think your drive is making charges interact slightly differently — and it's just destroying everything in an instant.""

George stared at the tablet, jaw tight, the silence stretching between them.

""So that’s it,"" he said finally, voice low. ""All this time... and it breaks reality the moment it works.""

He sank back in his seat, eyes fixed on some far point beyond the diner wall. ""We didn’t miss a calibration. We didn’t miscalculate the shielding. It’s the physics.""

He let out a slow breath. ""We built a miracle... and it kills everything that tries to come with it.""

""So what now?"" Antony asked, a little more carefully than usual.

At that moment, the waitress returned to clear their plates and asked if they wanted anything else.

George kept staring off into the distance, silent.

""We'll take a whole pie, please,"" Antony said, offering her an apologetic smile.

""Pie of the day is apple. That good for you two?"" she asked.

""Yeah, that should be fine. With ice cream, please — we could use a bit of a pick-me-up.""

""Got it,"" she said with a quick nod. ""I'll be right back with your pie.""

Only when the pie hit the table did George start to come back from wherever he'd gone.

""Come on, take a slice. We don’t have anything better to do for a while,"" Antony said, nodding at the melting pastry.

Apples could only be brought this far frozen or candied, so pie was the obvious choice. Ice cream was profitable enough out here to be worth hauling — no need to worry about keeping it frozen when space itself did the job for free.

George cut a slice without looking, the motion automatic.

The world hadn't ended. Not yet, anyway.

Antony looked down at the pie.""It's funny,"" he said quietly. ""We can make an apple pie from scratch... but we can't invent the universe.""

George looked up at him, confused.""What are you talking about?""

""Seriously? You've never heard the Carl Sagan quote? 'If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.' And here I thought you were the physicist.""

Just then, as if an apple had fallen and slammed into his head with the force of Jupiter's gravity, it clicked.

""Your analog thing — that kinda recorded some data, right? The fuses recorded what was actually going on inside the ship when nothing else did!"" George whisper-yelled, standing up and almost knocking over the table.

""Uh, yeah, I guess. Why?"" Antony mumbled through a mouthful of pie.

""Because we still have macroscopic memory! Discs, records, crystal storage — stuff that doesn't care if the electrons get scrambled for a second! The structure survives — the data survives!""

""Yeah, that's true — but it doesn’t really help if the data’s on the other side of the galaxy and you’ve got nothing to read it,"" Antony said, explaining while wordlessly urging George not to make a scene. ""No software — or firmware, for that matter — is going to survive the trip. That’s why we didn’t consider it in the first place.""

George sat back down, trying to contain his excitement over a half-formed idea.

""We need to reinvent the universe so that our analog signals can be read,"" he said. ""What if we used an analog storage system — but loaded it with just enough firmware and software to reprogram a clean, data-free piece of computer hardware? One that’s only tasked with setting up FTL comms?""

He glanced over, a little hesitantly. He wasn’t an engineer — at least not this version of him. He was a physicist, grasping at a way to salvage decades of research and the unimaginable energy it had taken to manufacture the antiprotons he was literally burning through.

No one was truly bothered by how much antimatter George's project had consumed. Yes, it was energy-intensive to produce — even with the slowly growing Dyson swarm around Sol — but many in the Empire enjoyed the challenge of meeting that demand with a previously untapped form of energy storage.

Antony was one of them, originally a power systems engineer in his first iteration.

But even more understood the deeper reason: we couldn’t afford to keep all our eggs in one basket. Everyone knew that when Earth was left behind to focus on the rest of the solar system — and a smaller, more determined group knew it when they committed to the slow, sublight journey to Proxima Centauri.

After a moment of quiet — and after George’s uncharacteristic outburst — Antony began to pick up the thread.

“And once we get the FTL comms working, we can remotely program any available hardware from Sol,” he said.

George looked like he was going to explode from excitement.

“But… to what end?” Antony added seriously. “Say we can start up an entire colony remotely with our auto-manufacturing systems — it would still take forever for anybody to physically reach it.”

He glanced around the diner, checking for non-citizens. The waitress was out of earshot.

Leaning forward, he whispered, “Yeah, maybe we’ll eventually be able to send a copy of a mind to another star system. But we haven’t developed the tech to run our minds on a digital substrate. We still need bodies.”

“Why can’t we just make bodies with our gestation tanks?” George asked, more confused than anything.

“We still need living cells to start the cloning process. That hasn't changed in hundreds of years,” Antony replied, channeling his inner, long-neglected biologist.

“Why can’t we just make cells? Y’know, from carbon and water and stuff?” George shrugged.

Antony looked at him, then down at his tablet.

“I need to make a call,” he said. “We’ll let you know what we figure out.”

He tapped the tablet on the table to pay his bill, then stood and headed back toward his shuttle.

*Technically, it’s possible to create life. But how? What would it take to build a viable animal cell from scratch?*

It probably had never been done — not because it was impossible, but because samples were always lying around.

*This is going to be much harder than just sticking people in a ship and pointing it at a star,* he thought as he exited the diner.

With everything at peak watt’s and giving myself a few hundred extra in case it equals out to 5k. Later on I want to add some sort of mini split so I’m aiming for a 7k watt generator

PULSAR PGDA70BISCO
- Just enough for my peak watts so is a bit tight. Noise level, weight & price is perfect.

WEN DF875IX
- if i should add on extra wattage this is great for price and weight, but the noise level is horrific at 82dba 

DUROMAX XP95001H
- extra wattage, very quiet, light enough but price point hurts. Hurts so bad. 

What would you suggest? I’ve read running it at 50% watts will keep my generator healthier so I’m not sure if that’s possible with the pulsar. Also not sure what my running watts are - only peak. Not sure how to figure this out.

1khymts,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Legal-Waltz3658/comments/1khymts/my_favorite_monologue_from_my_novel/,My favorite monologue from my Novel,"Now I’m going to my favorite conversation — the first one between Carl and the Narrator.

The story of this scene takes place on the night Amy dies.
Carl walks to Station 13 — wearing the clothes soaked in Amy’s blood.
The Narrator left, so I’ll be your voice here.
You know, you should get used to that.
Sorry I didn’t introduce myself.
I’m the writer.
Yeah… that one. The name on the cover.
I’ll keep this simple — no flourishes.
Carl goes to Station 13.
The place where he saw his beloved for the first time.
He sits on the same bench.
The bench that, no matter how you look at it, is always Bench 13 of the Station.
Symbolic, isn’t it?
But hey, I didn’t write it — I’m just reading what’s already there.
He sits on that bench and cries.
It’s past midnight.
No stars.
Even the stars were too afraid to watch Carl cry.

Suddenly, the air gets cold.
A man approaches from the distance, though you can’t see him clearly at first.
He gets closer, and now —
Wait. That man…
Damn him.
Sorry, I shouldn’t say anything yet.

He’s wearing a long gray coat and a matching gray hat.
Brown pants and shoes.
The hat’s pulled down just enough to hide his face,
but that bitter smile — that you can see.

He sits next to Carl.
Takes out a cigarette from a pack and says:

""Want one?""

Carl doesn’t respond.
Just lowers his head to decline.

The man says:

""No cigarettes, no whiskey… not even a proper curse unless Walter’s yelling in your ear.
Even when you want to make a decision, you only think for five minutes!
You’re amazing, Carl.""

Carl looks at him, shocked.

Carl: “You… how do you know all that? Tell me the truth!”
Narrator: “Truth is bitter. That’s why most people take their coffee with sugar… and their lives with lies.”

""You know Carl, you and I…
we’re similar.
But maybe…
maybe it’s just fate that has a problem with us.""

Carl: “You… who are you?”

Narrator: “Who am I? That’s funny — no one’s ever asked.”
Carl (angrily): “Answer me!”
Narrator: “Easy, boy, easy.
You know… I forgot who I used to be.
But now — they call me The Narrator.
My friends call me that.
I tell stories.
Your story… is different.”

Carl: “You… have friends?”
Narrator: “Yeah.
A few concepts.
And the graves of people whose stories I’ve already told.”

Carl lowers his head, afraid.
The Narrator speaks again:

""You know Carl, a coin has two sides —
one is victory, the other is defeat.
Victory means life.
Defeat means death.""

He tosses a coin in the air — but suddenly, it vanishes.

""You see, Carl…
I don’t even bother to check how the coin lands.
But you —
you really intrigue me.
Heads or tails?""

Carl: “The coin doesn’t decide for me.”

Narrator: “Alright… we’ll see.”

He tosses a coin — and it lands upright.
Not heads. Not tails. Just… standing.

Narrator: “Where I come from, this doesn’t happen.
Strange…
You know, Carl, even Fate is doubting you now —
even it has lost faith in you.
And I…
I love people who’ve lost their faith.”
“You used to have this spark in your eyes, but now…”

The Narrator points to Carl’s blood-soaked clothes.

“…Now we’re here.”

He pulls out Amy’s white scarf — now stained with blood.

Narrator: “Just five seconds.
That’s all it took, Carl.
Five seconds of distraction.”

Carl: “You… you…”

The Narrator laughs.

Narrator: “Don’t know what to say?
Yeah, sorry — no dialogue was written for you here.”

Carl: “I don’t care about dialogue.
I just want the truth.”

The Narrator pauses — surprised.

Narrator: “Wait… what did you just say?
You?
You never had anything to say.
You always surprise me.
But let me ask you something —
If you find the truth, what will you even do with it?
People chase it all their lives…
and when they finally find it,
they just stare at it.”

Carl stays silent.

Narrator: “You know Carl…
just five seconds.
You’ve always had a problem with time.”

The Narrator stands up.
A train whistle sounds in the distance.
The train arrives.
And as smoke fills the air, the Narrator vanishes into it —
but his voice remains:

“Whatever you choose, Carl…
I’ll be waiting.”

The train leaves.
And on the bench —
there’s a red lighter,
a cigarette pack labeled “5 Seconds,”
and a note:

“You know, Carl —
numbers are fate.
But no one looks at them that way.
Light a cigarette.
It’s not a sin.
At least not for people like us —
people who need to forget pain,
for just… an hour.”

Carl looks at it and says:

“Damn him.
He knew it all along.”

He lights a cigarette.

And yes — you guessed it right.

INT –DRESSING ROOM. 

ALONG TWO WALLS ARE TWO MAKE-UP STATIONS. ALONG THE THIRD WALL IS A SHORT CHESTERFIELD. A DRESSING SCREEN AND CLOTHES RACK FILL THAT CORNER. A SMALL REFRIGERATOR AND A COFFEE MAKER ON TOP ARE AGAINST THE FOURTH WALL WITH THE DOOR. 

THE DOOR OPENS. SAGE, ROSEMARY, THYME, AND PARSELY WALK IN. THYME HANGS HER JACKET ON THE CHAIR IN FRONT OF HER MAKEUP STATION. PARSELY FLOPS ON THE CHESTERFIELD. ROSEMARY WALKS BEHIND THE DRESSING SCREEN. HER OUTFIT TOP FLOPS OVER THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, AND A T-SHIRT SLIDES DOWN BEHIND IT. SHE WALKS OUT PULLING THE SHIRT THE REST OF THE WAY DOWN. SAGE REMOVES HER COLLAR, LOOSENS HER DRESS, AND PULLS THE RIBBONS OUT OF HER HAIR. THE LAST ONE THROUGH CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND THEM.

ROSEMARY

It was packed tonight. We’re only going on tour not quitting.

SAGE

Hopefully it’s a preview of what we’ll see on tour. We’ll have to get more merch in here, though. It’s moving.

PARSLEY

FOMO strikes again. Ain’t knockin it. It’s free advertising. Well free-ish advertising.

THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR

ROBINIA (THROUGH THE DOOR)

How dressed are you?

THYME

You can come in.

ROBINIA OPENS THE DOOR AND STICKS HER HEAD IN. 

ROBINIA

Great crowd tonight. We’ll have to do a big blow out with your last show here. The dates been finalized yet?

SAGE

Not yet. Caraway’s got most of them set. He’s working on the last few.

ROBINIA

‘Kay. Let me know. (pauses) And the other group, Delto Idesm. You have their manager’s contact. I was thinking maybe the two of you could do a pre-tour show here.

ROSEMARY STIFFENS.

SAGE

Relax Rose. 

ROBINIA LOOKS CONFUSED. THYME LOOKS SHARPLY AT ROSEMARY

THYME 

A professional disagreement. Which will remain professional.

SAGE

We’ve got to arrange for more merch, so we’ll get it to you then. It’ll give us a chance to make sure there are no issues with the show before the tour.

ROBINIA

I was thinking that too. Or at least it’s a good excuse for one last show.

ROBINIA LOOKS AT PARSLEY

ROBINIA (CONT'D)

Pars, there’s this guy, one of our regulars, at the bar looking for you. Acting like a nervous school girl. You want me to shoo him off?

PARSLEY SITS UP RIGHT ON THE CHESTERFIELD

PARSELY

Which one?

ROBINIA

The bear.

PARSELY

Yes! I’ll be out shortly. Pour him one on my tab.

PARSELY DASHES BEHIND THE DRESSING SCREEN. ROBINIA PULLS HER HEAD OUT OF THE DOORWAY

ROBINIA

I’ll let him know.

ROBINIA CLOSES THE DOOR.

THYME

Pars. Be careful, alright.

PARSLEY STEPS OUT FROM BEHIND THE DRESSING SCREEN. HER OUTFIT IS TIGHT BUT CONSERVATIVE. AN OPEN PLAID FLANNEL SHIRT HANGS TO JUST ABOVE HER KNEES.

PARSLEY

Yeah. I’ll have my craz-dar going. See y-all later.

PARSLEY WALKS OUT THE DOOR.

IN SAGE’S ROOM THE CURTAINS ARE OPEN AND THE SUN IS COMING IN. THE ROOM IS GENERAL CLEAN AND TIDY. SEVERAL PLANTS ARE EITHER HANGING FROM THE CEILING, ON THE DESK, AND THE DRESSER. SAGE FINISHES BRAIDING HER HAIR. SHE PICKS UP THE SATCHEL HANGING OF THE CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE DESK.

SHE WALKS OUT CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER. SHE WALKS DOWN THE HALL. SHE STOPS AND OPENS THE DOOR TO ROSEMARY’S ROOM AND LOOKS IN. THE CURTAINS ARE DRAWN TIGHT. DIRTY CLOTHES ARE PILED IN A CORNER. CLEAN CLOTHES SIT IN A BASKET. ROSEMARY IS SPRAWLED ON HER BACK IN THE BED ASLEEP.

ROSEMARY (SLEEPILY)

Oatmeal mostly chocolate chip muffins. Funny.

ROSEMARY ROLLS OVER ON TO HER SIDE. SAGE CLOSES THE DOOR. SAGE WALKS IN TO THE KITCHEN AND OVER TO THE REFRIDGERATOR. SHE OPENS IT AND PULLS OUT A GLASS MILK BOTTLE WITH A THICK GREEN JUICE IN IT. SHE PUTS IT IN HER SATCHEL. SHE WALKS OUT THE DOOR CLOSING IT QUIETLY BEHIND HER.

INT – “ACADEMY”/TRIAD MUSIC LOBBY. 

THE ROOM IS RECTANGULAR. A SEMI-CIRCULAR DESK, SLIGHTLY RAISED STANDS ON THE WALL OPPOSITE THE ELEVATOR DOORS. A LARGE SIGN READING “TRIAD MUSIC” FILLS MOST OF THE WALL BEHIND THE DESK. TWO VIDEO SCREENS ON EITHER SIDE DISPLAY THE TRIAD MUSIC LOGO BOUNCING AROUND THE SCREEN. AT EACH EDGE OF THE WALL ARE FROSTED GLASS DOORS. ON THE SIDE WALLS ARE A SERIES OF CHAIRS. THE WALLS HAVE FRAMED GOLD RECORDS, AND SOME PLATINUM RECORDS. BEHIND THE DESK IS SITTING ZINNIA

ZINNIA (SLIDING A PASS ON A LANYARD ACROSS THE DESK)

Hi, SAGE. They’ve got you in room five, with the baby grand.

SAGE

Thanks, ZIN. Quiet today?

ZINNIA

Yeah, that why I like working weekends. And I don’t mind they pay a bit extra for the inconvenience. Next weekend though…

ZINNIA TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND EXHALES.

ZINNIA (CONT’D)

They have this rush ADR job for some film. Somehow, we were the only place that had enough booths open. Going to be almost the whole weekend around the clock. But, they’re paying extra so no-one can complain too loudly.

SAGE PICKS UP THE PASS. SHE STARTS TOWARDS ONE OF THE DOORS. THERE IS A FAINT CLICK.

SAGE (CHUCKLING)

I hear you. See you on the way out.

INT – PRACTICE ROOM FIVE.

IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM THERE IS A BABY GRAND PIANO. SEVERAL STOOLS AND MUSIC STANDS ARE IN ONE CORNER. SAGE PITS DOWN HER SATCHEL AND PULLS OUT SOME SHEET MUSIC AND PLACES IT ON THE PIANO. SHE SITS DOWN ON THE PIANO STOOL AND ADJUSTS ITS POSITION. SAGE TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND PLACES HER LEFT HAND ON THE PIANO. SHE STARTS PLAYING THE PIANO SOLO FROM “PIANO CONCERTO FOR THE LEFT HAND, M.82” BY MAURICE RAVEL. SHE MAKES IT TO THE THIRD PAGE BEFORE MAKING A MISTAKE. SHE GROANS IN FRUSTRATION. BEFORE STARTING AGAIN.

INT – HALLWAY

THE HALLWAY IS STANDARD OFFICE BEIGE. THERE ARE PICTURES  OCCASIONALLY ON THE WALLS BOTH OF LANDSCAPES AND VARIOUS MUSICAL GROUPS. SAGE IS WALKING DOWN THE HALL. SHE IS SHAKING OUT AND RUBBING HER LEFT HAND. FROM ONE OF THE ROOMS DOWN THE HALLWAY COMES VIOLIN MUSIC. SHE STOPS IN FRONT OF AN OPEN DOOR AND LOOKS IN. 

THE ROOM IS A SMALL DANCE STUDIO. INSIDE SNAPDRAGON IS DANCING CONTEMPORARY BALLET WHILE PLAYING THE VIOLIN. SHE STUMBLES TO A HALT WHEN SHE SEES SAGE STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.

SNAPDRAGON

Sorry. I didn’t mean to disturb you.

SAGE

No, no. I was taking a break. My hand was beginning to cramp up. I didn’t mean to disturb you.

SNAPDRAGON LOOKS AT THE CLOCK ON THE WALL. AND PICKS UP A TOWEL HANGING ON A BARRE. SHE WIPES HER BROW. SHE HANGS IT AROUND HER NECK.

SNAPDRAGON

I’ve been practicing for a few hours. I should take a break myself. 

SNAPDRAGON AND SAGE WALK DOWN THE HALL.

INT – LUNCH ROOM.

THREE LARGE REFRIDGERATORS FILL PART OF ONE WALL. A COUNTER, SINK, ICE CUBE MACHINE, BOILING WATER TAP, A PAIR OF COMMERCIAL KEURIGS, AND A FEW OTHER APPLIANCES. THERE ARE SEVERAL FOUR PLACE TABLES WITH CHAIRS.

SAGE AND SNAPDRAGON WALK OVER THE REFRIGERATORS AND EACH PULL OUT A BOTTLE. SAGE HAS HERS FROM EARLIER. SNAPDRAGON HAS A LARGISH ATHLETIC WATER BOTTLE. THE BOTH SIT DOWN AT ONE OF THE TABLES. SNAPDRAGON EYES SAGE’S BOTTLE WARILY.

SNAPDRAGON

Okay. What’s in that?

SAGE

My mom’s secret blend of seven herbs and spices, spinach and tomatillo.

SNAPDRAGON (DOUBTFUL)

Interesting…

SAGE CHUCKLES.

SAGE

You’re right. But, I drank it the whole time I was growing up. So, it’s familiar and comfortable. And despite some of mom’s other opinions, it does work.

SAGE DRINKS FROM THE BOTTLE.

SAGE (CONT’D)

I’ve seen some of your performances. Why don’t you work in more of your dance into your shows?

SNAPDRAGON

We’ve tried. We can get some in. But, anything really fancy feels pushed and contrived. Some songs you can get more in than others. Part of the fusion process I guess.

SAGE

It is the same with trying to blend in classical piano with our stuff. It’s a bit easier I guess, the riffs and such can be pushed a bit to work with everybody else.

SAGE STANDS UP. SHE WALKS OVER THE REFRIGERATOR AND PUTS THE BOTTLE BACK IN.

SAGE (CONT’D)

Well. Gotta to get back it. Ravel isn’t going to wait, or get any easier.

SNAPDRAGON

Yeah. See you later.

SNAPDRAGON WATCHES AS SAGE WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. THERE IS A MIXTURE OF CONFUSION AND CONCERN ON HER FACE.

EXT – BEACH, URBAN WATERFRONT – LATE EVENING

THE BEACH IS MOSTLY EMPTY. A FEW COUPLES WANDER THE BOARDWALK. A JOGGER RUNS THROUGH THE SAND. A WIND IS GUSTING FITFULLY, JUST HARD ENOUGH TO MOVE SKIRTS AND LEAVES. HEAVY CLOUDS ARE MOVING IN OVER THE CITY.

IN A PERGOLA OFF THE BOARDWALK IS FLORA. SHE HAS A LONG GREEN OVERCOAT ON AND DONE UP. SHE IS LEANING AGAINST ONE OF THE RAILINGS. THYME WALKS INTO THE PERGOLA. THE SOUND OF HER FOOTSTEPS CHANGES ANNOUNCING HER PRESENCE. FLORA STRAIGHTENS AND TURNS AROUND.

THYME

Hello, mother.

FLORA

Thanks for coming Thyme. It’s been a while since we last spoke. I like coming out here. Between the waves and the wind, it sound like the forests of home.

THYME

Then, why did we leave? We could have helped father. I could have helped. Why did you have to drag me from our land, our people? Here. To the Smoke.

FLORA TURNS AND LOOKS OUT OVER THE WATER.

FLORA

You’re not wrong.

FLORA TURNS BACK TO FACE THYME

FLORA (CONT’D)

It was the – least worst decision. But, that’s not why I asked you out here. I heard about your tour. I hope it does well.

THYME

You approve of my playing now?

FLORA

I -- It doesn’t matter. I’ve seen you play, with your friends. Up there, you’re relaxed, you’re happy. You’re doing something worthwhile with your skills. I approve of that. I always have.

It’s just that when you heard off on tour, I won’t see you for a while. Even at your shows. I am proud of you and what you’ve done. I guess I needed to tell you that.

FLORA STARTS TO LEAVE

FLORA (CONT’D)

When you get back, you’ll have to tell me all about it. And send me a postcard from time to time. Okay?

FLORA WALKS DOWN THE BOARDWALK. THYME WATCHES HER LEAVE.

CARAWAY IS WORKING ON THE COMPUTER AND MAKING NOTES ON SOME SHEETS OF PAPER. DRETCH WALKS THROUGH THE DOORWAY WITH A PIECE OF PAPER.

DRETCH

How planned are the stops?

CARAWAY

Getting there. Should have it done tomorrow. You know how it can be. Max of eight hours between stops. Venue schedules. Media stops. Road side stands for fresh sweet corn.

DRETCH SITS DOWN IN ONE OF THE CHAIRS. SHE HANDS HIM THE PIECE OF PAPER.

DRETCH

Well, got a new one for you. Though perhaps it could be collected under media stop. It just came over from PR.

CARAWAY READS THE PAPER.

DRETCH (CONT’D)

I know Amaryllis will want to do this. But, she won’t want the media around.

CARAWAY

Been a while since I’ve seen one of these. 

CARAWAY LOOKS AT THE MONITOR AND TRACES A PATH WITH HIS FINGER.

CARAWAY

Doable… May have to stretch a run a bit. We’re not looking at their full act?

DRETCH SHAKES HER HEAD. 

DRETCH

It’ll probably be a best hits, with a meet and greet. Amaryllis won’t mind the fans posting stuff. So we don’t have to worry about arranging a full lock down.

CARAWAY NODS.

CARAWAY

That always makes it easier. I’ll see what they have in mind, and what they have available.

1khyi5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1khyi5t/scotland_the_balmoral_gleneagles/,Scotland - The Balmoral & Gleneagles,"Just returned from an eight day trip to Scotland / UK - with 3 nights at the Balmoral in Edinburgh and 3 nights at Gleneagles in Auchterarder (about 90 minutes north of Edinburgh).  This was our first trip to Scotland and, overall, it was a great experience for those interested in historical sites, beautiful scenery, castles!, and learning more about this part of the world.

# The Balmoral

I was very impressed with this hotel - more than I expected, to be honest.  Their pre-arrival communications were quick and responsive - providing us with hotel-sponsored experiences, recommended dining, and airport transfer options.  While we ultimately planned our own activities and dining, the eagerness to assist was appreciated.  They also communicated with me again a few days before our reservation confirming the details of our stay (including the airport transfer).  We booked a Castle View suite that was ready for us upon arrival (11:30am).  On the highest floor and in the corner, the suite was very comfortable, sufficiently large, and well maintained.  The bathroom featured heated floors and a heated towel rack, a separate tub and shower, and marble tiling.  The separate bedroom was also quite large with ample closet and drawer storage for wardrobes - although, for me, the mattress was overly firm.  And the living room was very comfortably furnished and decorated - with welcome gifts of Macallan scotch, a fruit bowl, and chocolates.

Service was very professional and responsive - consistent with our pre-arrival experience.  We had a couple of minor maintenance issues upon arrival that were fully remediated when we returned to our room after our afternoon out.  Housekeeping was excellent and timely.  And I received a personal call from the hotel manager on our second day simply to ask whether we were pleased with the accommodations and service, and whether there was anything he could do to improve our stay.  Frankly, everyone we encountered at the hotel was first rate.

We had breakfast each morning in the Brasserie (included in the room rate), which was also available in the room for a minor charge. The buffet had a great selection of breakfast items, and we could order other entrees (kippers, anyone?) from the menu. Service was just as good here.

Location-wise, the hotel is a short walk to the Royal Mile - making it very convenient if you are so inclined.  It is also directly next to the train station (it was originally built as a luxury hotel destination for train travelers), and only a couple blocks from New Town with more modern shopping, bars/pubs, and restaurant choices.  For those considering the Gleneagles Townhouse, while we didn't go inside, we walked by the location.  It is about 3 blocks from the Balmoral within the New Town - making it very convenient if that area of town is more your style.  It is a longer (but not too bad) distance from the touristy old town section that includes the Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace.

Recommendations for dining include The Kitchin (Tom Kitchin's 1-star Leith restaurant), Scran and Scallie (his more casual gastropub), Fisher's for seafood (New Town and Leith locations), and Dusit Thai (yes, there is good Thai in Edinburgh) in New Town (stop in to Thistle Street Pub next door for a pre- or post-dinner pint).  

Overall, we really enjoyed Edinburgh and would recommend the Balmoral (with the caveat that we did not experience the standard rooms so have no idea how they are).

# The Gleneagles

We were very excited to experience Gleneagles on this trip given everything we've been reading about this resort.  We booked a 3 night stay in an Estate Suite and secured a reservation at the 2-star Andrew Fairlie restaurant on site.

Signs that something was off started with the pre-arrival planning communications.  I reached out a couple of months ahead of time to inquire about transfers from Edinburgh, restaurant reservations on-site, and activities.  Responses were slow (I do realize that I may not have been a priority given the date of my reservation) - however, I did need to follow-up with them on certain unanswered requests.  A couple of weeks before my reservation, they sent me a pre-stay form to fill out, asking me - among other things - whether we needed restaurant or activity reservations.  As they had already made restaurant reservations for me for all three nights, this was odd.  I indicated that we had not made activity reservations.  There was no follow-up after I submitted the form, and there was no further pre-stay communication with the hotel.  Concerned about our transfer from the Balmoral, I reached out to them two days prior to arrival to confirm that this was still scheduled (it was).

Ground transfer from the Balmoral was £260 (one way).  Given the 90-minute duration and only two passengers, I expected a sedan.  Instead, it was a six person van (the same van they use to transport guests around property).  

Upon arrival, the property is simply breathtaking with gorgeous manicured grounds and stately buildings.  Inside, the lobby is equally impressive.  Our suite was ready (2:30pm) and we were escorted up to the most disappointing suite I've ever stayed in - the Edradour Suite.  The ""suite"" actually had two room numbers associated with it as it had two entry doors from the third-floor hallway - one into the ""living room"" and one directly into the bedroom.  The two rooms were connected inside via a small hallway that contained the wardrobe area.  The ""living room"" was small with a sad-looking burnt-orange sofa, small dining table and chairs, bar, and TV console.  Notably, the sofa had no coffee table or end tables and no table lamps.  In the bedroom, there were two twin beds pushed together (and made up separately) and an en-suite bathroom no different than one you would have in a standard room.  It was small, with one sink and just a tub-based shower.  In each of the two rooms, there were ""radiator"" looking boxes that housed the HVAC equipment.

I should have said something immediately but didn't as we were tired and my wife wanted to rest -  which turned out to be near impossible because: (1) the radiator in the bedroom emitted a loud buzzing noise every 7 minutes (yes, I timed it), and (2) you could hear every noise from the hotel hallway including the constant traffic going in and out of the service door across from our room.  

At this point, my ""doom spiral"" began.  

*Why can't the front desk staff understand that I want the bed reconfigued to a queen/king setup?*

*Why doesn't the server in the Birnam restaurant know the menu?  Why is her phone sticking out of her back pocket?  Why is my bottle of red wine really warm?  What are jumbo shells doing in my $40 pasta entree (i.e., they are so big I need to cut them up in order to eat them, and - no - they are not stuffed)?*   

*Why aren't any toiletries in the men's spa locker room other than soap and shampoo (i.e., no combs, hairspray, deodorant, shaving supplies, etc)?  Why does my bathrobe look (and feel) 10 years old?  Why is the massage table draped with a rough terry cloth bath towel - as is the material covering me?  Do they not have any sheets?  Hasn't anyone told them that the steam room has no steam?*

Sigh.

The doom spiral has firmly taken hold, and I need to do something to salvage this.

I find the hotel manager's email address on Tripadvisor and send him a note saying I'm not happy.

Within a couple of hours, thanks to Manager Darryn Wright, we were in a new suite that—although in the same category—is night and day different from our first suite. It has a large sitting area with comfortable furniture and tables, a large bathroom with a separate shower and double sinks, a huge dressing room with storage galore, and NO RADIATOR or HALLWAY noise!

I feel the doom spiral lifting as we get ready for our dinner at Andrew Fairlie.  

And it was a wonderful dinner.  The dining room is beautifully decorated, the staff are unfailingly polite and engaging, the young sommelier couldn't have been more passionate, and the food was largely well crafted.  I'm smiling now and starting to see the brighter side of this magical place.

The next day we take the train to Stirling to visit the castle.  It's a great day trip, but I look forward to getting back to the resort.  We walk the grounds, visit the dogs, gaze out over the fields.  Our last night is dinner at the Strathearn, but we have pre-dinner drinks in the American Bar first.  We say to each other how unique this place is.  It's frozen in time, but with a little modernity.  Everything is first class.  Our dinner was wonderful.  Was it perfect? No, but it's enjoyable and unique and in a grand dining room with a piano player and formally dressed staff and elegant food.

And I think to myself how nice it would be to return ...

OTHER NOTES:

I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that we did not do any activities on site other than the spa and walking the grounds.  So no help to you there.

We had lunch at the Dormy in the Clubhouse and it was quite good.  They offer pizzas, some sandwiches, and a fair amount of really tasty Indian dishes.  Very casual and looked popular with the families.

Breakfast is in the Strathearn dining room and it is splendid.  Very large assortment of practically everything you could want - plus you can order from the menu.

Gleneagles train station is only 5 minutes from the resort (they will pick you up and drop you off complimentary).  This is an alternative way to reach the resort from Edinburgh or other points.  It also allows quick day trips off property if you so desire. ",4,1746731569.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

Those words echoed through the minds of countless beings in the Galactic Empire, most of whom had no idea who had uttered them. But they were about to find out. They would see, firsthand, how humans could turn bureaucratic absurdity into a weapon.

And it all started with a single, absurd stunt.

Teslon SpuskX, eccentric CEO of SpuskX Interstellar, was not the kind of man who thought things through. His latest idea was, in a word, reckless. He'd been looking for a way to make the next big splash, the one that would turn the company into a household name, or at least into something more than a quirky startup trying to make its way in the crowded interstellar market.

His plan? Send a rocket into the restricted quadrant of the galaxy, the same quadrant that had been declared off-limits by the Galactic Empire eons ago. They'd stamped it with a No Entry sign, but for SpuskX, that was just an invitation. He thought it would make for an unforgettable livestream, something the public couldn’t ignore.

And so, on a day like any other, a rocket launched, soaring into the depths of forbidden space. The crowd watching on screens across the galaxy went wild. They were all there, in front of their screens, eagerly anticipating whatever wild spectacle Teslon had promised.

The problem was, Teslon hadn't read the fine print, none of the fine print, really. Galactic law was an ocean of rules, regulations, and archaic edicts that few even bothered to keep track of. After all, who cared about a law passed 9,000 years ago when it was clearly forgotten by the rest of the galaxy?

Well, someone did. And they worked at the Department of Galactic Empires (DGE).

A few days after the stunt, Teslon was relaxing in his office, reading reports on his profits. His communications console blinked to life, and the screen filled with a face he didn’t recognize, a grey-skinned alien with antennae twitching in annoyance.

This is an official communication from the Department of Galactic Empires, the alien said. You are in violation of Galactic Regulation 477, Subsection 4, Clause B, Paragraph 13, an ancient decree forbidding any human from entering the restricted quadrant under penalty of immediate imprisonment. Cease all operations and surrender your assets to the Galactic Council.

Teslon blinked, his mind scrambling to process the message. Wait, what? Who,

You have violated the law, Mr. SpuskX, the alien continued, unperturbed. We will send a task force to apprehend you. Your company will be dissolved, your assets liquidated, and,

A pause.

Wait, you’re saying because I sent a rocket into some restricted area? A place that’s been abandoned for millennia?

Correct.

Well, that’s absurd. What even makes it restricted? Teslon leaned forward in his chair, intrigued. What’s out there? Some sort of space-time paradox or... a giant, space-faring monster?

The alien didn’t respond immediately. The silence grew thick. That... information is classified, it finally said.

Teslon grinned. He loved classified information.

Okay, he said, leaning back in his chair, so you’re telling me that this law was passed thousands of years ago, and nobody’s bothered to enforce it since. But now, I send a rocket into some forgotten part of space, and suddenly, I’m the bad guy? And you want me to just surrender, what, everything? My entire company? My assets? You realize how big SpuskX is now, right?

The alien didn’t seem impressed. Yes. And you’ll surrender everything unless you want to be arrested immediately.

Teslon paused, thinking for a moment. He’d read somewhere that the Galactic Empire was a huge bureaucracy, bogged down by endless red tape. If there was one thing Teslon knew, it was how to take advantage of bureaucratic systems.

I’ll tell you what, he said, the idea clicking into place. I’ll cooperate. But I want to talk to your legal team first. I think we can work out an... arrangement.

The alien narrowed its eyes. There will be no arrangement. You will comply, or you will face the full force of the law.

Teslon sat up straight, a wide grin spreading across his face. Oh, no. I’m going to need more than just a task force. If I’m going down, you’re going down with me.

A week later, the galaxy was abuzz with unexpected news. Teslon SpuskX had filed an appeal, one that the Galactic Empire had never seen before. It wasn’t a request for leniency or a plea for mercy. It was a technicality. A loophole so ridiculous that it made everyone stop and reconsider just how deep the bureaucratic hole could go.

Teslon had ascended to Minor Ruler Status.

The law stated that anyone who violated Galactic Regulation 477 had to be given a title of nobility before they could be formally tried. And in one stroke, Teslon had maneuvered around the system, naming himself the ruler of the planet Mars. It was an absurdity, but it was enough.

Of course, the Galactic Empire didn’t take kindly to this. The legal teams scrambled, unable to find a way to resolve the issue. But Teslon wasn’t finished yet.

In the coming weeks, he would launch a series of bureaucratic assaults on the Empire, filing endless appeals and petitions, using outdated legal language to throw them off track. The result? A near-constant stream of paperwork that flooded the Galactic Council’s inboxes.

At the same time, Teslon launched what he called the Mars Independence Movement, an online campaign with the goal of making Mars a sovereign empire. A meme-based political movement spread like wildfire, and soon, Teslon found himself surrounded by passionate followers from oppressed planets who saw him as a symbol of freedom.

While the Department of Galactic Empires scrambled to figure out how to stop him, Teslon made more moves. He declared war, then peace, and even held a galactic IPO, all in a single week. His followers cheered, their voices swelling in the digital space.

The Galactic Council, now on the verge of losing control, issued a decree: Teslon SpuskX must appear before them for trial.

But Teslon wasn’t worried. Not even a little.

He had something that no one had seen coming: a legal team made entirely of AI lawyers, an entire army of algorithms designed to bend the law to his will. He even built a robot judge himself, to oversee the trial. The idea was simple: overwhelm the system with an avalanche of legal filings.

And so, the trial began. The Galactic Council sat in their grand chamber, preparing for the battle ahead. The courtroom was silent as Teslon SpuskX walked in, his robot judge trailing behind him. His AI lawyers stood in a line, ready to fire off counterclaims at a moment's notice.

The trial didn’t last long. The system began to slow down as the counterclaims piled up, one after another. In the end, the Galactic Council’s server infrastructure couldn’t handle the weight of 1.4 trillion counterclaims.

The verdict came down.

Teslon SpuskX legally owned 17% of the galaxy.

He celebrated by selling it as NFTs.

And all of it started with a rocket, an outdated law, and the most absurd bureaucratic loophole the galaxy had ever seen.

As he sold his share of the galaxy, Teslon leaned back in his chair, smiling.

All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.

Give me a form! I need a form to process the form!

It had been months since Teslon SpuskX had secured his spot as a Minor Ruler of Mars, but his thirst for chaos, no, innovation, had only just begun. The paperwork war was now in full swing, and the galaxy’s top bureaucrats were beginning to understand the true meaning of his legal assault.

The Galactic Empire’s most experienced agents were being pulled into the mess one by one. It started with the Department of Galactic Empires (DGE), but soon enough, every corner of the Empire felt the tremors of SpuskX’s paperwork crusade. The more they fought, the deeper the hole Teslon had dug grew.

Teslon’s latest stunt? A galactic survey campaign. But not just any survey. A survey designed to grant self-determination to every single planet in the galaxy, at least, those that felt oppressed by the Empire.

You’re going to declare every single planet its own sovereign nation? his communications officer, Kex, asked, raising an eyebrow.

Why not? Everyone loves a revolution, don’t they? Teslon replied, chuckling. Besides, every planet’s got a legal system, Kex. We just need the right paperwork to make it official.

And just like that, every planet in the galaxy that had been quietly overlooked or kept under Empire control was suddenly submitting forms, each one declaring their independence from the Galactic Empire. Mars was now the beacon of hope for oppressed worlds, and the tidal wave of signatures only grew with each passing day.

The DGE had their hands full. Galactic officials were scrambling, trying to process the paperwork, trying to figure out how one man had turned a farce into a global phenomenon. Teslon had found his niche, he exploited every loophole he could find, filing endless petitions, challenging outdated clauses, and demanding that the Empire accept a new system of governance.

The problem? The Galactic Empire had one major flaw: it was slow. Slower than the slowest-moving star in the system, slower than the bureaucrats who spent their time filling out forms they would never read. Teslon, on the other hand, wasn’t just fast, he was fast and clever. Every form he filled out had a purpose. Each application, a calculated move. He became a symbol of revolt in the eyes of the oppressed, a figurehead of chaos that the Empire couldn’t seem to defeat.

As Teslon’s meme-driven Mars Independence Movement continued to grow, so did his fanbase. Everywhere, people rallied around the cause of freedom, freedom through paperwork. It became a cultural phenomenon. Teslon’s name spread far and wide, reaching planets that had no idea they even had a legal system to begin with.

The DGE wasn’t blind to this. In fact, they were watching with growing concern. The Galactic Council had already issued a decree, Teslon must be brought to trial. A trial so grand, so important, that it would settle the issue once and for all: was the Galactic Empire truly as powerful as it claimed to be? Or had one man, armed only with paperwork and a dubious legal mind, managed to outwit them all?

The trial was set to take place on a neutral planet, a location neither under Empire control nor SpuskX’s. The Galactic Council’s top judges, lawyers, and legal experts assembled in the vast courtroom. They had prepared for this moment, gathering evidence, creating strategies, and plotting counterattacks to nullify SpuskX’s claims.

They underestimated one thing: Teslon SpuskX was always a step ahead.

The trial began with a grand procession. The Galactic Council members filed into the chamber, sitting in their towering thrones. Above them, holographic images of planets, star systems, and entire regions of the galaxy floated, each symbolizing their domain. The vastness of the Empire was on display.

Teslon entered the room alone, but not without fanfare. His AI lawyers, programmed with centuries of legal knowledge, stood at attention behind him. He was dressed in a sharp suit that screamed business, but there was something about the way he walked that suggested this was all just another day at the office.

I assume you’ve prepared the necessary documentation for today’s hearing? one of the judges, a broad-skinned alien named Ilg’zar, asked from the bench.

Oh, absolutely, Teslon said with a grin. I’ve got everything we’ll need to make this an interesting day.

Ilg’zar raised an eyebrow. We’ll see about that.

The proceedings began, and the courtroom was filled with the sound of scrolling documents, clicking datapads, and the murmurs of legal experts scanning through piles of paperwork. Teslon, with his ever-present grin, didn’t seem to care much about the formality of it all. His legal team, however, was all business. They filed claim after counterclaim, each more ridiculous than the last.

By mid-afternoon, the Galactic Council was starting to look strained. They had just finished reviewing an unprecedented number of counterclaims when Teslon’s AI lawyer, the one named Zethar, presented a new motion: the Galactic Tax Exemption for Small Empires and Sovereign States Act.

What is this? one of the judges, a massive being with four arms, demanded, clearly frustrated. You can’t possibly be suggesting,

Oh, but I am, Teslon interrupted with a smile. You see, under this act, Mars qualifies for complete tax exemption. All due taxes to the Galactic Empire will be void. As a Minor Ruler, I am entitled to these exemptions.

The court erupted into chaos. The legal experts scrambled to interpret the law, while Teslon calmly sipped from a cup of tea. He had known about this clause for years, but it was only now, in the heat of this trial, that he was using it to its full advantage.

Zethar didn’t let up. Also, the AI lawyer continued, as per Galactic Law 1300, Subsection 22, Paragraph 7, Teslon SpuskX is entitled to declare war on any galactic body. Considering the hostile nature of the Galactic Empire’s tactics, Mars has every right to declare itself free of Empire control.

One of the Galactic judges, a small creature who resembled a walking jellyfish, floated nervously in his seat. This is... an abuse of the legal system!

Not at all, Teslon replied. It’s simply a creative interpretation of the law. And if you want to challenge it, you’ll need to do so in writing. In triplicate. No exceptions.

It was working. The Galactic Empire’s legal system was crumbling under the weight of SpuskX’s paperwork. The Galactic Council had no choice but to give him more time to present his claims, and every time they tried to shut him down, Teslon would find another law, another clause to exploit.

Days passed. The trial turned into an exhausting battle of paperwork, claims, and counterclaims. Teslon was relentless, his team filed endless appeals, creating an ever-growing pile of paperwork that no one could keep up with.

Then came the unexpected twist. Teslon didn’t just file for tax exemptions or rights to self-determination. No, he had something far more ambitious in mind. He declared himself the rightful owner of several core systems in the galaxy. And through a technicality in the galactic deed system, he had acquired legal titles to those systems.

The Empire was on the brink of collapse.

The Galactic Council convened one last time, their voices echoing in the courtroom.

SpuskX, one of the judges began, his voice shaking, you are forcing us into a corner. There is no way out. Your claims,

Teslon’s smile widened. I believe we’re done here.

And just like that, the system crashed. It was impossible to handle the weight of a trillion counterclaims, millions of petitions, and the complex web of legal maneuvers Teslon had set into motion.

The verdict came down hours later. Teslon SpuskX, through paperwork alone, had acquired 17% of the galaxy. And he was about to sell it off as NFTs.

The galaxy watched with baited breath. Teslon SpuskX, the man who had taken the Galactic Empire to its knees using nothing more than legal loopholes, had finally emerged victorious. His ownership of 17% of the galaxy was a fact now, a certified truth recorded in the annals of galactic history. His victory was an absurdity. It was also a reminder of how vulnerable a system could be when it was mired in its own bureaucracy.

Now came the final move.

The Galactic Empire, humbled by paperwork, tried to close ranks, attempting to regain some form of control over their fractured systems. But they couldn’t. They could not bring themselves to fight what had already been legally decided. What did the Empire do when their most powerful weapon, control, was taken away by forms, signatures, and submissions?

Teslon knew they would try something. They always tried to do something. The might of the Empire would never accept the situation. But Teslon had anticipated that. In fact, he had been counting on it.

He sat comfortably in his private office aboard the *SpuskX Mariner*, a ship designed to handle intergalactic business, paperwork, and stunts. The sleek, futuristic design was punctuated by stacks of forms and datapads strewn about, a chaotic reflection of his legal empire. A small, satisfied smirk tugged at his lips as he watched the digital news feeds. The galaxy was in upheaval.

He could feel the tension building. He could hear the low rumblings of unease coming from every corner of the Empire. The news had spread like wildfire, Teslon had secured legal control of vast sections of the galaxy, and now he was about to monetize it.

Declare war, peace, or an IPO... All in one week? Kex said as he walked into the room, carrying a coffee cup that looked oddly out of place in the high-tech environment. You sure that’s the way to do this?

Teslon chuckled, eyes still locked on the holoscreen. You’ve got to keep them guessing, Kex. You know how it is. You make one move, and they start to think they can predict you. But no one can predict a galactic IPO.

And what if they do start predicting you? Kex asked, raising an eyebrow.

Teslon’s eyes flicked over to his friend, the corner of his mouth twitching upward. Then I’ll just submit an appeal. I’ll challenge the concept of prediction itself. I’m sure there’s a law against it somewhere.

Kex shook his head with a smirk, taking a seat across from him. You’re unbelievable.

Maybe, Teslon said with a shrug. But here’s the thing, Kex. I didn’t start this to change the galaxy. I started this because... well, it was fun. The most entertaining thing about all this bureaucracy is watching them squirm. I didn’t want to be Emperor of the Galaxy. That wasn’t my goal. All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.

Kex snorted. Good Wi-Fi?

Teslon nodded, grinning. That’s right. For too long, the Empire has hoarded the best tech, the best bandwidth, the most reliable systems. You can’t even stream a good movie without your connection dropping in half the galaxy. But now... well, now I control 17% of the galaxy. If you want a connection to Mars, you’re going to need to pay my rates. And those rates are going to be higher than anything the Empire can manage. No more lag, no more buffering.

It was ridiculous. It was absurd. But it was genius.

Teslon leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepling as he surveyed the situation. He had done the impossible. And now, he was going to sell it to the highest bidder.

The announcement came a day later. Teslon SpuskX, now legally recognized as the ruler of 17% of the galaxy, had decided to sell it off, piece by piece, through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The press release was brief but effective:

*In light of my legal victories, I am now offering exclusive ownership of the following star systems, planets, and resources in perpetuity. By acquiring one of these NFTs, you will legally own a piece of the galaxy. Please read the terms and conditions carefully, as some planets have very specific laws regarding ownership, but trust me, it’s all in the fine print.*

Within hours, Teslon’s NFTs were all the rage. Investors, opportunists, and even the casual wealthy began snapping them up. The virtual marketplace was alive with transactions, each one more ludicrous than the last. People were buying and selling entire solar systems like they were rare trading cards. Teslon had created a new form of commerce, one that thrived on absurdity, speed, and legal chaos.

The Galactic Empire watched in horror as more and more systems were bought up. A small but significant part of the galaxy was now, legally, under the control of private citizens. Wealthy corporations began to establish their own sovereign planets, complete with security forces, currencies, and, most importantly, unrestricted access to the newly constructed SpuskX Wi-Fi network.

The Galactic Council, desperate to regain control, attempted to issue a decree. They argued that Teslon’s NFTs were illegal under Galactic Law 3300, Section 12, Clause 7. The ruling was immediate and expected.

Teslon’s response? I’ve already filed an appeal, and I’ve attached a petition for an extension on your ruling. It’s not my fault that your legal system is so outdated. Maybe you should consider updating it, but I can help with that too. Just send me a form, and I’ll have a lawyer fill it out for you.

The Galactic Empire had no choice but to sit back, helpless, as the digital landscape shifted around them. Teslon SpuskX had not only outsmarted them, he had transformed the entire structure of the galaxy. He was a king, not by force or violence, but by cleverness, legal tactics, and a willingness to bend, break, and redefine the rules.

The closing line of his press release summed it all up perfectly: *All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.*

Months passed. The dust of the trial had settled, but its effects were still being felt. Teslon SpuskX had successfully dismantled the hold of the Galactic Empire over vast portions of the galaxy. With his own network of planets, resources, and even political allegiances, he had created a new form of governance, one that thrived not on might, but on paper.

The Empire? It had learned a hard lesson. It had learned that no system, no matter how vast or powerful, was immune to the corrosive influence of paperwork. The galaxy would never be the same. But as for Teslon, he remained on top, sitting comfortably in his chair, sipping his tea. Life was good.

For Teslon SpuskX, the victory was sweet, but it was only the beginning.

*Next,* he said with a grin, *we take over the galactic coffee supply chain.*

It became a cultural phenomenon. Teslon’s name spread far and wide, reaching planets that had no idea they even had a legal system to begin with.

The DGE wasn’t blind to this. In fact, they were watching with growing concern. The Galactic Council had already issued a decree, Teslon must be brought to trial. A trial so grand, so important, that it would settle the issue once and for all: was the Galactic Empire truly as powerful as it claimed to be? Or had one man, armed only with paperwork and a dubious legal mind, managed to outwit them all?

The trial was set to take place on a neutral planet, a location neither under Empire control nor SpuskX’s. The Galactic Council’s top judges, lawyers, and legal experts assembled in the vast courtroom. They had prepared for this moment, gathering evidence, creating strategies, and plotting counterattacks to nullify SpuskX’s claims.

They underestimated one thing: Teslon SpuskX was always a step ahead.

The trial began with a grand procession. The Galactic Council members filed into the chamber, sitting in their towering thrones. Above them, holographic images of planets, star systems, and entire regions of the galaxy floated, each symbolizing their domain. The vastness of the Empire was on display.

Teslon entered the room alone, but not without fanfare. His AI lawyers, programmed with centuries of legal knowledge, stood at attention behind him. He was dressed in a sharp suit that screamed business, but there was something about the way he walked that suggested this was all just another day at the office.

I assume you’ve prepared the necessary documentation for today’s hearing? one of the judges, a broad-skinned alien named Ilg’zar, asked from the bench.

Oh, absolutely, Teslon said with a grin. I’ve got everything we’ll need to make this an interesting day.

Ilg’zar raised an eyebrow. We’ll see about that.

The proceedings began, and the courtroom was filled with the sound of scrolling documents, clicking datapads, and the murmurs of legal experts scanning through piles of paperwork. Teslon, with his ever-present grin, didn’t seem to care much about the formality of it all. His legal team, however, was all business. They filed claim after counterclaim, each more ridiculous than the last.

By mid-afternoon, the Galactic Council was starting to look strained. They had just finished reviewing an unprecedented number of counterclaims when Teslon’s AI lawyer, the one named Zethar, presented a new motion: the Galactic Tax Exemption for Small Empires and Sovereign States Act.

What is this? one of the judges, a massive being with four arms, demanded, clearly frustrated. You can’t possibly be suggesting,

Oh, but I am, Teslon interrupted with a smile. You see, under this act, Mars qualifies for complete tax exemption. All due taxes to the Galactic Empire will be void. As a Minor Ruler, I am entitled to these exemptions.

The court erupted into chaos. The legal experts scrambled to interpret the law, while Teslon calmly sipped from a cup of tea. He had known about this clause for years, but it was only now, in the heat of this trial, that he was using it to its full advantage.

Zethar didn’t let up. Also, the AI lawyer continued, as per Galactic Law 1300, Subsection 22, Paragraph 7, Teslon SpuskX is entitled to declare war on any galactic body. Considering the hostile nature of the Galactic Empire’s tactics, Mars has every right to declare itself free of Empire control.

One of the Galactic judges, a small creature who resembled a walking jellyfish, floated nervously in his seat. This is... an abuse of the legal system!

Not at all, Teslon replied. It’s simply a creative interpretation of the law. And if you want to challenge it, you’ll need to do so in writing. In triplicate. No exceptions.

It was working. The Galactic Empire’s legal system was crumbling under the weight of SpuskX’s paperwork. The Galactic Council had no choice but to give him more time to present his claims, and every time they tried to shut him down, Teslon would find another law, another clause to exploit.

Days passed. The trial turned into an exhausting battle of paperwork, claims, and counterclaims. Teslon was relentless, his team filed endless appeals, creating an ever-growing pile of paperwork that no one could keep up with.

Then came the unexpected twist. Teslon didn’t just file for tax exemptions or rights to self-determination. No, he had something far more ambitious in mind. He declared himself the rightful owner of several core systems in the galaxy. And through a technicality in the galactic deed system, he had acquired legal titles to those systems.

The Empire was on the brink of collapse.

The Galactic Council convened one last time, their voices echoing in the courtroom.

SpuskX, one of the judges began, his voice shaking, you are forcing us into a corner. There is no way out. Your claims,

Teslon’s smile widened. I believe we’re done here.

And just like that, the system crashed. It was impossible to handle the weight of a trillion counterclaims, millions of petitions, and the complex web of legal maneuvers Teslon had set into motion.

The verdict came down hours later. Teslon SpuskX, through paperwork alone, had acquired 17% of the galaxy. And he was about to sell it off as NFTs.

The galaxy watched with baited breath. Teslon SpuskX, the man who had taken the Galactic Empire to its knees using nothing more than legal loopholes, had finally emerged victorious. His ownership of 17% of the galaxy was a fact now, a certified truth recorded in the annals of galactic history. His victory was an absurdity. It was also a reminder of how vulnerable a system could be when it was mired in its own bureaucracy.

Now came the final move.

The Galactic Empire, humbled by paperwork, tried to close ranks, attempting to regain some form of control over their fractured systems. But they couldn’t. They could not bring themselves to fight what had already been legally decided. What did the Empire do when their most powerful weapon, control, was taken away by forms, signatures, and submissions?

Teslon knew they would try something. They always tried to do something. The might of the Empire would never accept the situation. But Teslon had anticipated that. In fact, he had been counting on it.

He sat comfortably in his private office aboard the *SpuskX Mariner*, a ship designed to handle intergalactic business, paperwork, and stunts. The sleek, futuristic design was punctuated by stacks of forms and datapads strewn about, a chaotic reflection of his legal empire. A small, satisfied smirk tugged at his lips as he watched the digital news feeds. The galaxy was in upheaval.

He could feel the tension building. He could hear the low rumblings of unease coming from every corner of the Empire. The news had spread like wildfire, Teslon had secured legal control of vast sections of the galaxy, and now he was about to monetize it.

Declare war, peace, or an IPO... All in one week? Kex said as he walked into the room, carrying a coffee cup that looked oddly out of place in the high-tech environment. You sure that’s the way to do this?

Teslon chuckled, eyes still locked on the holoscreen. You’ve got to keep them guessing, Kex. You know how it is. You make one move, and they start to think they can predict you. But no one can predict a galactic IPO.

And what if they do start predicting you? Kex asked, raising an eyebrow.

Teslon’s eyes flicked over to his friend, the corner of his mouth twitching upward. Then I’ll just submit an appeal. I’ll challenge the concept of prediction itself. I’m sure there’s a law against it somewhere.

Kex shook his head with a smirk, taking a seat across from him. You’re unbelievable.

Maybe, Teslon said with a shrug. But here’s the thing, Kex. I didn’t start this to change the galaxy. I started this because... well, it was fun. The most entertaining thing about all this bureaucracy is watching them squirm. I didn’t want to be Emperor of the Galaxy. That wasn’t my goal. All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.

Kex snorted. Good Wi-Fi?

Teslon nodded, grinning. That’s right. For too long, the Empire has hoarded the best tech, the best bandwidth, the most reliable systems. You can’t even stream a good movie without your connection dropping in half the galaxy. But now... well, now I control 17% of the galaxy. If you want a connection to Mars, you’re going to need to pay my rates. And those rates are going to be higher than anything the Empire can manage. No more lag, no more buffering.

It was ridiculous. It was absurd. But it was genius.

Teslon leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepling as he surveyed the situation. He had done the impossible. And now, he was going to sell it to the highest bidder.

The announcement came a day later. Teslon SpuskX, now legally recognized as the ruler of 17% of the galaxy, had decided to sell it off, piece by piece, through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The press release was brief but effective:

*In light of my legal victories, I am now offering exclusive ownership of the following star systems, planets, and resources in perpetuity. By acquiring one of these NFTs, you will legally own a piece of the galaxy. Please read the terms and conditions carefully, as some planets have very specific laws regarding ownership, but trust me, it’s all in the fine print.*

Within hours, Teslon’s NFTs were all the rage. Investors, opportunists, and even the casual wealthy began snapping them up. The virtual marketplace was alive with transactions, each one more ludicrous than the last. People were buying and selling entire solar systems like they were rare trading cards. Teslon had created a new form of commerce, one that thrived on absurdity, speed, and legal chaos.

The Galactic Empire watched in horror as more and more systems were bought up. A small but significant part of the galaxy was now, legally, under the control of private citizens. Wealthy corporations began to establish their own sovereign planets, complete with security forces, currencies, and, most importantly, unrestricted access to the newly constructed SpuskX Wi-Fi network.

The Galactic Council, desperate to regain control, attempted to issue a decree. They argued that Teslon’s NFTs were illegal under Galactic Law 3300, Section 12, Clause 7. The ruling was immediate and expected.

Teslon’s response? I’ve already filed an appeal, and I’ve attached a petition for an extension on your ruling. It’s not my fault that your legal system is so outdated. Maybe you should consider updating it, but I can help with that too. Just send me a form, and I’ll have a lawyer fill it out for you.

The Galactic Empire had no choice but to sit back, helpless, as the digital landscape shifted around them. Teslon SpuskX had not only outsmarted them, he had transformed the entire structure of the galaxy. He was a king, not by force or violence, but by cleverness, legal tactics, and a willingness to bend, break, and redefine the rules.

The closing line of his press release summed it all up perfectly: *All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.*

Months passed. The dust of the trial had settled, but its effects were still being felt. Teslon SpuskX had successfully dismantled the hold of the Galactic Empire over vast portions of the galaxy. With his own network of planets, resources, and even political allegiances, he had created a new form of governance, one that thrived not on might, but on paper.

The Empire? It had learned a hard lesson. It had learned that no system, no matter how vast or powerful, was immune to the corrosive influence of paperwork. The galaxy would never be the same. But as for Teslon, he remained on top, sitting comfortably in his chair, sipping his tea. Life was good.

For Teslon SpuskX, the victory was sweet, but it was only the beginning.

*Next,* he said with a grin, *we take over the galactic coffee supply chain.*

I really like sugary carbonated beverages and I definitely impulsively over eat just because it tastes good or feels good. I love eating. I love food. I love soda. I love Red Bull. I love carbonated lemonade. I love it all. When I’m out and about it’s really easy to convince myself to just buy a soda, or when I’m getting gas in the morning to grab a Red Bull. I also work at a restaurant so I have endless free soda, but buying fizzy little treats also really hits that dopamine button for me. I’m a really bad impulse spender, another thing I’m working on.

Simultaneously I really freaking hate buying water. I live in an area where we have fresh spring water on tap and the concept of bottled water is so egregiously wasteful to me that I never buy it. But I also can’t keep track of a fucking water bottle. I don’t even know how many I’ve bought and lost. So I don’t carry water with me. So I’m always buying sodas or Red Bulls etc. 

Recently I’ve been really consciously working towards eating healthier and moderating my consumption. I did the math and I was consuming 5 to 6000 cal a day!  Insane. Adjusting my food has actually been pretty simple but kicking the sugary beverages has been tough. I let myself have a cup of coffee with milk and sugar in the morning, but I really don’t need more caffeine than that and I’m trying to stick to water throughout the rest of the day. It’s been hard but I’ve been managing although what’s happening as I’m just not drinking anything until I get home at night. So I’m exhausted dehydrated all day. 

Finally broke down the other day and grab a giant bottle of water. Finished it easily and wasn’t craving soda. Told myself I’d refill it but then lost it of course. I was craving another soda in line at the store today, almost convinced myself it was fine to just do it because I’ve been doing so well, but a little voice in my head said “just buy the freaking water!”. I stopped and thought about it and did the math and I’m still saving money if I buy a bottle of water every
time I want a sugary drink instead of a soda. From now on I’m going to just let myself buy the bottle of water. I’ll drink more water, get my spendy dopamine hit, and drink less soda.

1khych9,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1khych9/does_the_waterdrop_k19h_countertop_reverse/,Does the Waterdrop K19-H Countertop Reverse Osmosis System Truly Deliver? Review Included!,"The Waterdrop K19-H Countertop Reverse Osmosis System caught my eye due to its promise of instant hot water, powerful filtration, and effortless setup. As someone who has tested numerous water filtration systems, I was eager to put this reverse osmosis device to the test in my daily routine. Here's my honest take on its performance, usability, and any hiccups I encountered along the way.

**Plug-and-Play Convenience Sure Saves Time**

Unlike traditional under-sink setups that require drilling or complex installation, this countertop unit was ready to go right out of the box. I simply plugged it into an outlet in the kitchen, and within moments, it was functional. This ""no installation required” feature makes it perfect not just for homes but also for renters or RV enthusiasts like my brother, who often struggles with portable yet efficient solutions. Whether placed in the office, the kitchen, or even in a dorm room, its compact design fits well in tight spaces while still delivering high utility.  

[Check Waterdrop K19-H price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08f7kcmll/)

**Unparalleled Filtration Performance**

Filtering efficiency is where this system really shines. The six-stage filtration system guarantees that even the finest impurities are removed. During my tests, it handled everything from TDS, chromium, and heavy metals to fluoride and PFAS. I even ran tap water through it after some major plumbing work (we all know how murky that can get). The result? Clear, pure, and better-tasting water every single time. This makes it a great fit for anyone conscious of improving the water quality for themselves or their family. What’s worth noting, though, is the system needs to be plugged in during operation, which may limit placement options if an outlet isn't close by.

**Intelligent Features for Modern Use**

Touchscreens on home devices used to frustrate me, always complicating things instead of making them simpler. But the smart screen on this water dispenser turned out to be an exception. It’s intuitive, displaying key info like water temperature, filtration status, and water quality. My favorite part? The 4-mode water capacity options and the adjustable water temperature settings. While I enjoy piping hot tea, my partner is into room-temperature hydration—and this machine caters to both tastes effortlessly. And let’s not forget the child lock feature, which kept my nephews from scalding themselves during their chaotic visits.

**Instant Heating Technology is a Game-Changer**

Waking up in the morning and waiting for the kettle to boil feels like a lifetime, but with the V-type heating technology in this system, hot water is dispensed instantly in just 3 seconds. Unlike systems that create limescale over time, this device eliminates that issue entirely. The no-reboil design guarantees fresh water without the odd taste some machines develop after prolonged use. My morning coffee sessions have never been smoother or quicker.

**Pluses**

- Easy plug-and-play setup saves time.
- Six-stage filtration ensures exceptionally clean, pure water.
- Intuitive touchscreen with adjustable temperature and volume options.
- Child lock feature enhances safety for families with kids.
- Instant heating with no-reboil mechanism delivers fresher, better-tasting water.

**Drawbacks**

- Placement is limited to areas near electrical outlets.
- Reduced flow rate in heating mode, though it's noted as normal by the manufacturer.

**Saving Energy and Water Like a Pro**

A vital aspect is how eco-friendly and cost-efficient it manages to be. Its 3:1 pure-to-drain ratio helps conserve water compared to many systems I’ve tested in the past. Add in the reusable drainage recycling technology, and you have a system that keeps waste to a minimum. The capacious 170-ounce water tank was a huge plus for me. It reduced my regular trips to refill the tank, saving both effort and frustration. This combination of usability and sustainability hits the mark for anyone seeking an eco-conscious option.

**Product Competitors**

The countertop reverse osmosis system has some tough competition. Take the Aquatru, for instance. It is similar in compact form and straightforward installation but falls short in heating options and lacks the ingenious drainage recycling feature. On the other hand, the Berkey water filter makes a great argument for portability but doesn’t offer the high-tech convenience or purity levels this system provides. Another comparable product, APEC Water Systems, delivers extraordinary filtration capacity and longevity but leans heavily on complicated setups that just don’t match the ease of the Waterdrop K19-H.

**Worth Every Penny**

Given its innovative features, efficient filtration, and added perks like the instant heating function and smart tech interface, it offers excellent value for its price range. While comparable systems may boast similar purification levels, this could stand out for those who prioritize ease of use, technological upgrades, and energy-saving design. Plus, with its sleek ivory-white finish, it’s as much a contemporary kitchen accessory as it is a health-centric appliance. Whether you’re outfitting a new apartment or upgrading an old setup, the investment feels entirely justifiable.

1khyahi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatioParadise/comments/1khyahi/why_choose_the_rattaner_7piece_patio_furniture/,Why Choose the Rattaner 7-Piece Patio Furniture Set Review for Ultimate Comfort?,"Rattaner B0BVDVSS6K and its accompanying title might be a mouthful to say, but using this 7-piece patio furniture set felt more like living a backyard dream. With its sharp design and thoughtful functionality, this set has become a standout in outdoor furniture. Testing this product daily over a few weeks taught me a lot about its build quality, comfort, and versatility. While most of my experience was positive, there are several aspects worth discussing, including a couple of quirks that popped up.

**Design and Craftsmanship**  
Something about the mix of light grey tones and the artisan weaving immediately caught my eye. The half-moon and round HDPE wicker material look not only stylish but also incredibly robust. It held up impressively well through a series of testing conditions, including a random rainy day when I forgot to cover it! The powder-coated steel framing feels very durable and sets a solid foundation for this furniture to endure plenty of outdoor fun. Despite its heavy-duty vibe, the whole ensemble manages to boast a sophisticated aesthetic, easily blending into a modern or classic outdoor layout.

**Comfort That Delivers**  
Honestly, the cushions were what sold me. Thickened to four inches and filled with high-resilience foam, they felt like sitting on clouds compared to my last outdoor set. Plus, the bottom anti-slip dotted fabric was clever. I don’t even need to constantly reposition cushions after every use, which I had to do with my old furniture frustratedly. This all-day comfort made family BBQ nights even better. My kids enjoyed relaxing on the loveseat while roasting marshmallows, and nobody wanted to leave the comfy spots!

[Ready to buy Rattaner B0BVDVSS6K? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://patioboutique.com/p/b0bvdvss6k/)

**Fire Pit Functionality**  
The integrated 60000 BTU propane fire pit table turned this set from an ordinary outdoor seating arrangement into a year-round social center. I tested the fire pit during chilly autumn nights, and the warmth was just right—so was the ambiance. Blue crystals with dancing flames added a cozy touch, while the woodgrain marble tile top looked heavenly as a coffee table when the fire pit wasn’t in use. However, keep in mind, you’ll have to purchase the propane tank separately.

**Ease of Assembly**  
This isn’t a throw-it-out-of-the-box-and-use-it kind of set. It came tightly packed in six boxes, which was daunting at first. But the instructions were very detailed—something I rarely say about furniture nowadays! My coworker and I set it up over a weekend afternoon. We even watched the assembly demo video online, and it walked us through the process effortlessly. But yeah, don’t try assembling this alone unless you enjoy frustration and excessive sweating.

**Positives**  
- Stunning light grey design with high durability.  
- Thick, comfy non-slip cushions.  
- Multi-functional fire pit table for warmth and utility.  
- Easy customization for different layouts.  

**Negatives**  
- Assembly requires patience and potentially help.  
- Propane tank not included for the fire pit.  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to other patio furniture I’ve tried, like the popular sets from Devoko or Wisteria Lane, this one holds its own remarkably well. The cushions provide better support than the more affordable Devoko options, while the fire pit is a significant upgrade over Wisteria Lane’s simplistic coffee tables. But then again, Wisteria Lane was slightly lighter, making it easier to move around. Meanwhile, Rattaner’s heavier build signifies superior stability in windy conditions. If durability and multi-purpose functionality are your priorities, this set beats out those competitors with flying colors.

**Worth Every Penny**  
When you think about it, this patio set is like getting multiple things in one. Seating for seven, a fire pit with aesthetic flair, and materials built to survive weather conditions make it a standout investment. In my personal opinion, this hits a sweet spot for the kind of quality you hope for versus its price tag. While not the cheapest patio set out there, its features and high-end feel make the price feel justified. Heck, it even comes with waterproof covers, which I’m already relying on to keep it pristine for years to come.

I recently experienced sudden shortness of breath and faintness, accompanied by heaviness in my chest while on a leisurely walk with my dogs. I called my primary who told me to go to the ER due to the chest pain. Bloods were WNL minus the known anemia, chest rads were normal, symptoms had subsided. There was a sinus arrhythmia detected on my ECG. Halter monitor and follow up with hematology- signs likely caused by low hemoglobin plus no food and lots of coffee.

They placed a halter monitor as a precaution which I wore for a week and have yet to send back due to issues with my insurance - was told it was authorized but it wasn't and the charge was going to be excessive. The ER doc told me he wasn't concerned but wanted to be thorough. Saw my PCP to check on anemia 2 days later and she said she also wasn't concerned and didn't feel any follow up was needed unless symptoms returned or abnormal halter result.

The cardiology office has been calling me 2-3 times a week to book a follow up! I explained to them that with the halter monitor issue I can't comfortably make an appointment that I may end up paying out of pocket for. The person I spoke to seemed to understand - however they continue to contact me. I have no signs, my halter test is currently inconclusive, and the interpretation of my ECG was:

Measurements Intervals Axis  Rate: 69 P: 22 PR: 138 QRS: 69 QRSD: 96 T: 54 QT: 382  QTc: 409  Interpretive Statements Sinus arrhythmia RSR' in V1 or V2 probably normal variant

Based on what I was told verbally and I see in my chart... follow up with another ECG  or completed halter test would be first before prompt follow up would be indicated? I have mild anxiety and these constant calls aren't helping at all. I feel totally healthy, I like to be a ""compliant patient"" but when I ask why this is strongly recommended the responses I've gotten are all variations of ""to be on the safe side"" ... because I had one instance of SOB? Seems excessive. I'm all for offering the gold standard of care but transparency would help a lot... like is this out of true concern or to fulfill a full rule out? I am fine with having a sinus arrhythmia that is most likely a normal healthy heart, I don't need to be 100% sure of it.",1,1746730999.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’ve been making pour overs/filter coffee at home for a long time. I also work part-time as a barista and have a decent amount of experience working with espresso, dialing in, etc. I recently picked up a “like-new” Gevi grinder with high uniformity burrs so I can start working on espresso at home/experimenting with more beans/flavor profiles. I also want to start crafting my own latte recipes in addition. I usually drink cortados, iced americanos, sometimes flavored lattes, and sometimes straight espresso shots when ordering espresso drinks. I do enjoy the darker traditional roasts at time but i tend to prefer really enjoy the acidic, fruity, floral nature of lighter beans. I would typically be making about 2-3 drinks per day but when experimenting, making more, or making for friends. At this moment, i'm having a bit of choice paralysis.

in terms of budget, i really don’t want to spend more than 3000 USD but i can push my budget a little bit as well. I’ve thought about getting a flair for individual shot experimentation, in addition, i’ve thought about getting a profitec 400 but also thought my needs might be better suited with a profitec 600 with flow control, duo boiler, etc. but i also am concerned i might not have enough control with the limitations of an E61 grouphead. But i'm also not sure i wouldn't have enough control. There's also the need to acknowledge the ECM synchronika II but to be honest, I don't know all the much about it other than it being a tank, having an excellent reputation, and being german engineered like the profitec. I guess i also have concerns about being limited by a vibration pump on the profitecs vs rotary on the ECM. 

Is something like a gagguino better suited for my needs and getting an individual milk frother so i dont have to worry about having a duo boiler? I know i can figure out the mechanical mods to the gagguino. I’ve also thought about a decent but that’s also pretty expensive. Is getting a flair for lever control and then also a machine my best bet? I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice and can help me with clarity. Thanks!

It was on the market for a while and when we went to see it, the listing agent is from the same agency as our buying agent. 

The negotiation was fine, we upped our offer to their asking so we could get our closing costs covered. Gave them EMD and set up the inspection. Seller didn't want to get issues found in inspection evaluated or to pay for any repairs. We didn't sign up for an as-is house so we started looking for other homes. 

Seller changes his mind and gets contractors out to look into repairs. Big issues are the roof, electrical, and plumbing. Seller gets the roof done. Our agents are cutting commission and paying for the electrical inspection at this point to make the deal happen. 

I'm on a rollercoaster. We're already back into house hunting, not sure what's going on with the contract, our lender isn't sure either. Seller is getting pipes looked at, and at this point we've had 3 rejected offers so I'm back in on this house. I'm thinking about fences and mailboxes, where we'll put our sofa, our commutes, and drinking coffee in the morning in our new living room. However, I won't sign anything until we get the report on the pipes and the next thing I know, they didn't get the inspection done because they couldn't find the clean out cap. 

Then I hear the seller is trying to fire his agent. I have no idea what's going on. It feels like my agent doesn't want to do the deal if the seller is still trying to sell but fired my agent's coworker. They cut their commissions when working out the deal, so I'm wondering if seller wants to save himself seller commission by firing his agent after he found a buyer/me. I don't want to give someone like this my money. He's selling because of tragedy in his life. 

On the other hand I, maybe baselessly, suspect my agent hasn't been going to bat as hard for us on the three other offers we've made since the inspection snafu because we've been entangled in this deal. We've gotten our EMD back from escrow too. I think I know I should cut losses like my agent is suggesting, but I'm still upset this happened. I was going to give up on that property after he said no to repairs. I should have not gotten involved with a selling agent who works with my agent, I thought maybe they could do this smoothly, but it's been a mess.",1,1746730867.0,RealEstate,3,1.0,False

I’m a 22m currently enrolled at UO. I’m really into video games (fps and mmo’s), tv/movies/anime, cooking and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Generally I’m a quiet person and try to pick up after myself, and I do have 2 cats who I love very dearly (I’ve been taking care of them for a while so I can maintain them). 

Rent would be $650 a month + half of the electric, it’s a 2 bed 1 bath with a living room, kitchen and balcony. It’s mostly furnished with a sofa, coffee table, microwave, air fryer,  and on site laundry (not in unit, it does take quarters). No Tv either, but I’m saving up for that slowly.

1khy5rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotTopicsFaith/comments/1khy5rq/how_can_i_love_my_neighbor_practical_steps_and/,How Can I Love My Neighbor? Practical Steps and Biblical Guidance,"Loving our neighbors is a central teaching in Christianity. Jesus emphasized this commandment in Mark 12:30–31 (NKJV):

""And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.""

But what does it look like to love our neighbors in practical terms? Here are some actionable steps, supported by scripture:

1. Meet Tangible Needs
Jesus taught us to serve others, especially those in need. In Matthew 25:35–36 (NKJV), He said:

""For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.""

Consider helping a neighbor with groceries, offering a meal, or assisting with household chores.

2. Spend Quality Time Together
Building relationships requires time and presence. Romans 12:15 (NKJV) encourages us:

""Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.""

Engage in conversations, share experiences, and offer a listening ear.

3. Practice Hospitality
Opening your home fosters community and connection. Romans 12:13 (NKJV) advises:

""Distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality.""

Invite neighbors over for a meal or coffee to build deeper relationships.

4. Offer Emotional Support
Sometimes, simply being there for someone is the greatest act of love. Galatians 6:2 (NKJV) reminds us:

""Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.""

Offer encouragement, pray with them, or just spend time together during difficult times.

5. Share the Gospel
Sharing the message of Jesus is an essential aspect of loving others. Matthew 28:19–20 (NKJV) commissions us:

""Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you.""

Share your faith through words and actions, always with love and respect.

6. Advocate for Justice
Loving our neighbors includes standing up for justice and equality. Proverbs 31:8–9 (NKJV) instructs:

""Open your mouth for the speechless, in the cause of all who are appointed to die. Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.""

Speak out against injustice and support those who are marginalized.

By embodying these practices, we reflect Christ's love to those around us. As 1 John 3:18 (NKJV) states:

""My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.""

Let's commit to loving our neighbors as ourselves, demonstrating God's love through our actions.",2,1746730740.0,HotTopicsFaith,0,1.0,False
1khy5ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pottery/comments/1khy5ki/porcelain_woes/,Porcelain woes,"Hey y'all, looking for some friendly advice as I'm feeling a little defeated at the moment.

I've been consistently throwing stoneware for the past 6 years and am quite proud of the quality of pieces I produce at this point. Recently, I finally decided to try porcelain for the first time, so I took a beginner - intermediate wheel class with a teacher who knew my current skill level. I spent most of the class just practicing throwing different shapes, and only fired 5 pieces in the 6 weeks that the class ran for.

3/5 of those pieces came out with S cracks, but I'm not entirely surprised due to there being some inconsistency in thickness of the walls vs the bases.

I practiced some more and when I started feeling confident about throwing really thin, I made 3 small lidded incense burners that I was so excited to get out of the bisque...they all S cracked! I'm honestly a bit gutted, but I know that's the nature of the beast. I don't necessarily want to give up on porcelain, but I have never had pieces crack so consistently and I can't help but feel like I'm wasting clay and money.

I just received my first wholesale order for coffee mugs from a local cafe, and they want stoneware. I was originally going to do the order and then hop back on the porcelain grind, but seeing all these cracks is making me feel like maybe I should just stick with what I know. I want to be able to start selling at markets soon, but I'm not building any inventory working with porcelain.

Should I keep trying with porcelain? I've been recycling it and I have roughly 25lbs of reclaimable clay in my buckets, but I'm struggling with the process (it doesn't seem to slake down at all) and had to re-do my last batch because it dried out too much before I got to wedging it, so I'm getting frustrated.

Originally developed by Dr. Valter Longo, this diet mimics a fasting state by reducing calories and adjusting macronutrient ratios to avoid activating nutrient-sensing pathways like mTOR and IGF-1. It’s often followed monthly for 3–6 cycles to support metabolic health and weight loss.

# 🔍 FMD in a Nutshell

* **Days 2–5**: \~725 calories
   * 47% carbs, 9% protein, 44% healthy fats
* Drink at least 7 oz of water per day
* No animal products, dairy, or processed foods

# ✅ Top Approved Foods

**Low-Protein, Plant-Based Sources**

* Nuts (macadamia, almonds, walnuts)
* Seeds (chia, sunflower, pumpkin)
* Nutritional yeast
* Small portions of lentils or veggie soups

**Healthy Fats**

* Avocado and avocado oil
* Coconut oil (in moderation)

* Small portions of squash, carrots
* Cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles
* Broth-based soups

**Drinks**

* Herbal teas (caffeine-free)
* Lemon water
* Black coffee (no sugar, no cream)

# ❌ Foods and Habits to Avoid

* High-protein foods (meat, eggs, fish, dairy)
* Processed snacks, sweets, or fast food
* Protein powders or bars
* Eating outside the plan or skipping water
* Exceeding the calorie/macronutrient targets

What this looks like in game is that he very rarely actually attacks enemies, instead his entire build revolves around using the SISYPHUS-Class NHP and the Spotter and Field Analyst talents to ~~torture me~~ make sure his allies never miss and then taking advantage of the Emperor frame and it's various overshield systems to ~~torture me further~~ make sure him and his allies can shrug off any hits that he can't make to miss. To conclude, he described his goal as ""A combination of Ender's Game and Shinji and Rei from Evangelion"" (I cannot atest to the accuracy of this statement as I am not familiar with either piece of media).

Next, we have an investigative reporter and podcast host obsessed with the famous Lancer and vigilante known as ""Spider-mech"". Yeah, I'm just gonna be straight with you: he's J. Jonah Jamison. His build is a pretty classic nuclear-brawler build, a high-heat melee build who, with the help of the Nuclear Cavalier talent, turns that heat to his advantage to do some pretty devastating damage. He also harnesses that heat to brew himself high quality coffee.

Our next player is actually playing a subaltern under the control of the space station that the players are effectively indentured to. He was introduced to their group both to bolster their numbers and to allow the NHP who controls the station to keep an eye on them. He is an artillerist to his core, a connoisseur of big guns, big AOEs, and big damage.

Finally, we have a Karrakin noble, a scion of House Khayradi of the House of Stone, destined for power and privilege. He was never actually particularly excited with the idea of becoming a baron, but he followed his role regardless, until he met a person from the House of Dust with whom he fell in love. They disillusioned him of the House of Stone's strict federalist noble-and-ignoble ideology, and so he eloped with them to forge his own path. Well, now that he's woken up on a space station with no idea where his partner is or how to leave to go find them, he's kind of freaking out. He pilots a melee Minotaur, and his build is certifiably wacky, consisting pretty much of a largely incoherent collection of talents, systems, and weapons that he just sort of thought seemed cool.

Well, those are my players' pilots. Now, tell us about your pilot (or party if you're a GM)",17,1746730054.0,LancerRPG,8,1.0,False

A weekly real-world meetup for startup builders, high-agency doers, AI explorers, and misfits who want more than just coffee and talk.

Think:

Co-create sessions

0-fluff convos

Real accountability

Access to future collaborators (or maybe your co-founder)


The catch?

Only 8-10 seats per week

Invite-only (starts free)

You must bring energy, not ego

1khxsbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kickboxing/comments/1khxsbh/i_lost_it_to_my_own_head/,I lost it to my own head,"Well, I'll summarize the story well, I recently went to the SP state championship in Osasco, my first fight in a ring, we left my city at around 6pm on Friday and went to a neighboring city for the weigh-in, great, we weighed in, we were informed that our bus would leave at 1am, so far so good, the time arrived for us to go and we boarded, at the beginning of the trip we were also informed that we would not go to the hotel, we would travel 7 hours and would stay at the stadium until the time of our fights.....
At that time I thought it was a bit crazy, but it was ok, I still had the bus ride to sleep and try to rest at least a little, arriving at the championship venue at around 6:00 am, I was informed that my fight would be at 5:00 pm, well I was calm and went to eat, drink a coffee in the tents and at around 12:00 pm I went to find a place to charge my cell phone (That was the beginning of the discord), at that same time I heard my name being called at a glance, then the conversation began. I was rushing, I grabbed my cell phone and ran out to change and detail, my clothes hadn't arrived in time for the championship so I had to get them from an athlete friend, and at that time he was in a fight, it was a hell of a rush, people calling me, my teacher didn't show up (which would be my corner), my friend finishes his fight and gives me his pants in the middle of the audience so I can change (I was almost losing wo), in the middle of all this I wrapped my bandages and without having done any warm-up I got into the ring.
First round: at the beginning of the first round I already received a few bombs but I managed to defend myself and make a more or less movement, I threw some punches and kicks and was pushed towards the ropes, I held on and moved away and the same thing happened again and again until the end of the round, no big deal.
Second round: in the second round I started to press my kicks more with power, however I was feeling a lot in my back thigh because I hadn't warmed up beforehand, my shoulders were cracking for the same reason, I went into a ring cold, my head was already full of fear, well he came up and put me on the ropes again, but this time I gave up myself, he hadn't given me any very powerful punches, but I didn't want that situation anymore.
Conclusion I was pissed at the total disarray of how the championship went, I was angry with my teacher for not trying to find out what time it would be, with the circumstances of having to travel more than 7 hours and fight without having a legal rest, for me to get into the ring in a rush and yet the teacher said that I hadn't caught anything, even though he wasn't even present at the time, he only arrived 1 minute later and even more pissed off that he hadn't done a proper warm-up, a strategy, my opponent was already sweaty HR that we entered the ring, he was doing the warming up and with the corner paying attention. I'm sure I would do much better if it weren't for all these circumstances and if it were within my capacity.

About me: I’m 25 year old black woman from South Africa. I am in the medical/mental health field, but recently took a leap of faith and left my job due to a toxic work environment, so I’m currently job hunting!. I consider myself to be gentle and soft. I am the oldest sibling, so I’ve always had the role of taking care of the people around me, and for once I would love that role to be reversed, even though that’s still a challenge for me. 

I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I love a good scented candle, as well as a sweet treat. I’ve recently gotten back into fitness, mostly just pilates and walking. I’m a big foodie, and a sucker for coffee shops. I don’t have any kids, but would love some in the future. I also enjoy watching kdramas. 

I grew up in a Christian family, and spent most of my childhood/teen years serving, being in the worship team, attending conferences, you name it! I became born again when I was 14, and baptised in university. My faith means a lot to me, and God has been my anchor throughout my life. 

Dating as a Christian woman has been very challenging. I believe in saving myself until marriage, and from experiences, men (even Christian) would be okay with this…until they’re not and try to convince me otherwise, which is always disappointing and frustrating. However, I believe that there’s someone out there for me that won’t try to make me stray from my values and beliefs. 

I’m hoping to find my husband through this. I’m looking for someone between 25-30 (open to slightly younger or older if there’s a connection). I want someone who leads with love, and pursues with intention. Someone who is loving and caring, and values communication. I am open to long distance, so location does not matter; neither does race. I’m not too specific when it comes to physical attributes, just that you should take care of your health, and be taller than me (I’m 1.65 m), but this isn’t a dealbreaker. 

I don’t feel comfortable sharing my picture here, but happy to do so in private.

1khxrsv,https://i.redd.it/w5cijgjcslze1.png,Just shipped: Insights search,"It was a stressful period. Almost two weeks of sleepless nights, lots of coffee, and a feeling of exhaustion… and now, search is in on the air. Hooray! I thought it would be much easier, but let me tell you everything in order.

Search in Discovry works in two ways:

* A search button has been added to the insight card. Clicking it will show you a selection of other similar or related problems. This is very handy when you like an idea and want to check how in-demand it is. Or maybe you're thinking about additional features that could be implemented within the chosen idea — then you can draw inspiration from a collection of similar insights.
* There’s also a text search option where you can type in a query. I’d recommend using this in two ways:
   * You can enter a short phrase (e.g., ""payment provider"") and get insights related to the topic.
   * Or you can enter a detailed description of an idea. This is really useful when you have your own concept and want to validate it. By using search, you can assess how relevant the problem you're trying to solve is and what people think about it. Based on the search results, you can effectively refine and improve your idea.

As the amount of data in Discovry grows, search will deliver even more interesting and relevant results. But even now, it performs incredibly well — personally, I’ve already made several valuable discovries.

Now, a bit about the development process. Implementing the search itself was fairly simple. The real challenge awaited me on the UI side. The main page of Discovry has four tabs, each with infinite scroll. I needed to ensure that when switching between tabs, their state was preserved so that users could return to a previous tab and continue scrolling from where they left off. Think of Twitter/X — the logic is the same.

Preserving the state itself isn’t the problem. The real difficulty was making sure it worked preformant enough, without any lag. I tried three different libraries for infinite scroll, experimented with multiple approaches, and spent hours identifying unnecessary re-renders and optimizing performance. In the end, I achieved the desired result with acceptable performance, but the solution still isn’t optimal, and I’ll have to rework it in the future.

And I realized that a well-implemented infinite scroll is far from trivial.

In any case, I’m very happy to announce that search has been released, and I think it turned out great. So I invite you to try it out and share your thoughts. Meanwhile, I’ll go tackle some tech debt. After that, I’ll start working on a cool new feature — more on that later.",1,1746729779.0,discovry,0,1.0,False

I meant to post this sooner, but I've wanted to really brainstorm it. There are some of these tropes that have shown up in a few fics, but I figure it can't hurt to add them in case someone sees it here and it triggers an idea for them. If any of these inspire you, please come back and drop the link! 💕

Also, because my primary ship in this fandom is Logan/female builder or Logan/ofc (I'm boring like that, but I have read a few very excellent Pen/builder fics, even if I still prefer for Logan to be endgame), that's what my prompts are written with in mind. Feel free to adjust any of these towards your own ship if they inspire your creative juices. 

This isn't exactly a request post or anything, but if anyone *does* take one on and decides to tag me, I'd love to read it. I do personally only read HEAs (even if it's only happy for the main couple), and I try not to read infidelity fics, but ya'll have at these and go where your muses take you. 😊

Warning: I think there might be one or two game spoilers in here, but I'm assuming if you're reading the fanfic that you're already aware of most of the game plot. Also I am so sorry for how long this post is. lol It got away from me.


• Battle couple (fighting kink? 🫣😏)

• A/B/O (fated mates? alpha/omega? alpha/alpha? Truly I see Logan as a soft alpha who will go to the ends of the earth to make his omega smile, leaves monster parts at her door in the night like a cat, attempting a clumsy but cute courtship, and will worship her nest building abilities on his knees (heh), but I can also absolutely see the builder as an alpha or a non-traditional omega)

• Werewolves (vanity genetic manipulations gone wrong?)

• Other fantasy creatures (vampires, mermaids, selkies (a selkie craving the water, but thinking that she's keeping her seal skin safe in the desert? What if Logan's mom left because she was a selkie?), other fun creatures I'm too tired to remember, etc etc)

• Cursed!character, other magic elements

• Unhinged!Logan

• Obsessed!Logan (it's canon that he was spying on the town, right? Well, what if he gets a little obsessed with keeping an eye on the new, suspiciously hyper competent builder and things just evolve from there?)

• Dark!Builder and/or dark!Logan

• Murder couple (it's such a fun trope 😭)

• Soulmates/soul marks 

• Shared dreams

• Childhood friends AU (what if the builder spent summers/holidays with family in Sandrock? What if after the school sandstorm tragedy, Howlett worked to have the funds to send Logan to school somewhere else, training him in monster hunting during the summers but wanting him to have a full education?)

• Builder finds out about Duvos and has to join Logan on the run

• Alternative start (story begins before the game does? Builder was always from sandrock and only left for a couple years for school? Builder and Logan meet before the events that lead him to becoming an outlaw? Builder joins him in being an outlaw or was already, idk, an outlaw or bounty hunter or something??)

• Logan never left (snuck in and out without bombing the church, so got his father's last words without becoming a criminal?) and is investigating duvos from inside the town

• Howlett lives AU

• Invasion lasts longer/turns into full scale war

• Extreme canon divergence 

• Builder comes across Duvos plans independently 

• Pen/builder/Logan (I'm fascinated by how this could be made to work. Fanfic is where anything can happen after all)

• Unsuur/builder/Logan (there's *potential* there, and they'd both be so caring towards the builder, but also I know I'm not the only one who dated Unsuur while they waited for Logan to come back to town. lol Though I may be the only one who, because of a bug where when Unsuur is asking us to go on that date mission got interrupted by the water tower events, created a whole headcanon where Unsuur had a one sided rivalry with Logan 😂)

• Grace/builder/Logan (🥵) (what if grace and the builder start dating while grace is still undercover, before she reveals she's a spy? The *drama* of the builder trying to figure out if what they had was real, falling for Logan when he comforts her, all three of them realizing they have feelings 🫠)

• Avery/builder/Logan (look, I just want to be in a sandwich between those two, can you blame me? ALSO, did anyone else notice how (iirc) the builder was the only one Avery actually put the medal on instead of just handing it to? And he like kinda paused???)

• I'm a f!builder/Logan (or ofc/Logan) shipper, but I am genuinely shocked there are basically no Elsie/Logan fics. I think I only saw one, and it was a dead dove. 

• Crossovers (c'mon, this is begging for a Firefly crossover lol)

• Reincarnation AUs

• AUs that take place during the Age of Corruption/Calamity/Age of Darkness

• I've seen fics where the builder is from the past, what if it's Logan/his family who is sent from the past, or where the builder is from the canon game year, but is sent to the past where they meet the other game characters, how do they handle having that knowledge of the future?

• Coffee shop AU (okay, this is a joke, but it would be fun lol)

• Modern day AU/our own historical past AU 

• Courting instead of dating (make it ✨elaborate✨ lol I read a fic recently where sharing personal water was basically an ""I love you"" gesture and offering a shower was an *~ahem~* offer, and I really, really loved that entire concept)

• Isekai and transmigration (if there was ever a perfect setting for this trope it's a video game, especially one with insane sci-fi experimentation elements)


Some other fandoms I'm in have fests pretty often, what if we run some too? Fluff fest, Outlaw fest, Soulmates fest, etc? I know there's a discord server, but I don't use discord so I'm not sure what's scheduled or planned over there and I don't mean to step on any toes. 

Does anyone else have trope suggestions or prompts? Especially some of the fun tropes that usually show up, but haven't shown up in this fandom just yet? If you want to, feel free to use this post to add your own prompts in the comments and if someone takes it on maybe they can reply here. If someone takes on your prompt, make sure to leave kudos and comment on the fic! 💕",1,1746729557.0,MyTimeAtSandrock,1,0.67,False

Emailed Sey for brewing instructions, received the below response if anybody’s interested!

#Aeropress
GRIND - Grind as finely as you can without causing clumping in the grounds. Your grind should be finer than percolation/drip, but not quite as fine as espresso.

WATER - Always use fresh, clean, and soft water between 40-120ppm. Maintain a rolling boil throughout the brewing process.

RATIO - This basis of this recipe is a 1:17 ratio, but the water weight can be scaled up or down depending on your equipment and preferences. Always keep the coffee dose the same when adjusting ratios.

01 Bring your brew water to a boil (212F), place a paper filter into the Prismo cap, and screw onto the base of the Aeropress. Place the Aeropress on a decanter or sturdy mug.

02 Dose 15g of finely ground coffee into the brewers base, then tare your scale. Give the brewer a shake to ensure the bed is flat before brewing.

03 Start a timer and pour 255g of water in a steady, strong stream from a good height above the brewer. Once all the water has been added, place the plunger gently into the top of the Aeropress base to help retain heat.

04 When your timer reads 5:00, remove the plunger and using a spoon or the paddle that comes with the Aeropress, stir back and forth and side to side two times each, then return the plunger to its position, and slowly plunge. This should take roughly 30 seconds.

05 Enjoy your coffee! If it tastes sour, hollow, or metallic, grind finer. If it tastes drying, astringent, or harsh, grind coarser. If you are looking for more extraction complexity from your brew, try increasing the ratio to 1:18 by using 270g of water. If the flavor is too delicate and transparent, try 1:16 by using 240g of water.",1,1746729522.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

Is it me or them?,"Tl;dr - are they not into me and I've horribly misread friendliness for flirtation OR they're happy flirting but anything more is hard for them and they keeps breadcrumbing me into remaining around without more closeness?

Hello! 

I met someone last year. They're a decade older than me (aka lot of different ways of communicating) and we met at work so there's that. But there was a lot of attraction, a lot of flirtation, at the same time a lot of care. But each time I would extend that care into the words, like saying something marginally sweet and absolutely unimportant, they would just shut down. At the same time, in action, they've shown deep deep care for me while losing words whenever they're feeling deep affection towards me.

I will give you examples of them shutting down.

I first noticed this when I discovered that a really good coffee shop is very close to where they were and I was going to be around soon, and just because we share a mutual love for coffee which they made a thing about, I excitedly said that I was really happy to learn that this place was so close while we were discussing some thing. They're usually very responsive to me and responded to everything we were discussing, completely sidestepping my coffee shop joy. This was fairly early into our association so I took it to be a subtle and gentle way of them letting me down easy, letting me know that maybe they didn't want to associate with me in that close way and as much as it sucked after all the build up I accepted that and made a mental note to not communicate anything of that nature that may feel suggestive to them even though all I was saying was that I was excited about the proximity of good coffee.

Months later when I had moved on and we had occasional exchanges in between but nothing significant they  got back in touch and I was very surprised that the vibe we'd shared before the pause was still there. Not wanting to get my hopes up however I continued to engage with them as I would with a friend and not someone I had a potential something with, accepting that maybe they could just flirt and be warm in a friendly capacity, and not deal with it when it became real. But here's the weird part. The last time we hung out there was a lot of sweetness and intimacy and I don't know what happened where suddenly in some part of the conversation they kinda started talking about how people perceive them as better than what the reality might be and one of the forms of that perception was of them being good in bed. I was a little startled by the nature of that because well werent we avoiding such conversations (?) but I am a sport and treating it as if a friend was saying it, I responded jokingly that maybe it's just that others imagine that they're good in bed and they were very surprised by my comeback and jokingly retorted saying that ""oh no that's not good for me, f you,"" all in good humour. I eventually left and as we have been doing, a day after we hung out, I said thank you over a text and that it was quite fun to hang out with them, which I think is a pretty platonic statement. They chose to respond to everything in my text BUT that statement. We've been on a pause since.

Imagine if someone dug up shiny yellow rocks in 2025 and said “This is going to change the world! You should store your wealth in this.”

What would people say? 

“It doesn’t produce income.”

“Sounds like a scam.”

“Greater fool theory.”

“It’s useless without cash flow!”

“You can’t buy coffee with it.”

Of course that’s exactly what people say about Bitcoin today.

But gold won not because it was shiny, but because it was harder money.

Harder money always wins, because it's better at preserving value over time.

Bitcoin is just the next evolution in that same story.

Harder money than gold. More divisible, more portable, more verifiable, more scarce.

1khxi9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1khxi9h/explore_this_kalita_wave_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Explore this Kalita Wave pour over coffee maker review for the best brew!,"The Kalita Coffee Brewer Pour Over (item model number: Coffee Brewer Pour Over) quickly became a central part of my daily coffee routine. As someone who thrives on perfectly brewed coffee to kickstart my mornings, I’ve tested a fair share of coffee makers—ranging from high-end espresso machines to inexpensive single-serve devices—and this pour-over dripper surprised me in many ways. It might look unassuming with its compact, glass-bodied design, but it’s packed with thoughtful features that cater to both coffee novices and seasoned pour-over enthusiasts. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
Visually, it’s a sleek and modern addition to any kitchen counter. The heat-resistant glass body, paired with its flat-bottomed brewing bed, doesn’t just look refined; it feels durable in hand. While glass can sometimes feel delicate, this brewer balances sturdiness with portability perfectly. Although smaller than I imagined, the design proved to be incredibly practical—I could brew anywhere from 16 to 26 ounces in one go, ideal for solo coffee sessions or sharing a rich cup with a friend. The patented wave filter indeed adds a unique design touch, and its flat base with three extraction holes looks minimal yet highly intentional. Plus, the thoughtful dimensions mean it rests steadily on various mugs and carafes without fear of tipping coffee everywhere.

**Ease of Use for All Skill Levels**  
The pour-over approach can feel intimidating to beginners, but this brewer makes it approachable. I personally found the flat-bottom design forgiving compared to the classic cone-style drippers I’ve used before. There’s less concern about grind uniformity or perfect water-pouring technique. This forgiving nature is a game-changer, especially when rushed mornings don’t allow for absolute precision. The reusable filter is another great feature—easy to set up, simple to clean, and more sustainable than disposable filters. My cousin, who recently dabbled in pour-over coffee, found it easy to learn with this dripper after struggling with stalling issues on cone models.

[Check Kalita Coffee Brewer Pour Over price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b004w5kpsq/)

**Features That Stand Out**  
The best part of this dripper is the patented wave design. By keeping water agitation uniform, the wave helps avoid over-extraction, resulting in consistently balanced, full-bodied coffee. I remembered questioning whether this small design feature would actually deliver when first testing it out—but after tasting my first cup, it became clear just how game-changing this thoughtful touch is. Another highlight is how adaptable it is while fitting snugly onto a variety of mugs and carafes; I’ve paired it with everything from my chunky ceramic coffee mug to a slim travel thermos without any issue. It’s great knowing that portability and compatibility are not sacrificed with this brewer.

**Merits**  
- Consistent coffee quality thanks to uniform extraction.  
- Beginner-friendly flat-bottom design lessens complexity.  
- Beautiful and durable heat-resistant glass construction.  
- Works well across all standard cup sizes.  

**Deficiencies**  
- Requires specific Kalita wave filters, which might limit flexibility.  
- The glass feels delicate during cleaning—extra caution is needed.  

**Challengers**  
Compared to other flat-bottom drippers, like the Hario V60 or Chemex, this Kalita model excelled in its simplicity of use without completely compromising the quality of the brew. The Chemex might look more iconic, but I feel the smaller batch size of the Kalita and its quick-cleaning process make it a bit handier for everyday use. Meanwhile, the Hario V60 gives more control over the brewing process with proper technique, but beginners might find the Kalita less intimidating. It doesn’t hurt that the wave design minimizes common issues with over-agitation, something I’ve struggled with when using the V60 in the past. Still, the proprietary filter makes it less versatile—standard cone filters don’t quite fit successfully in this brewer, which might put some off.

**Worth Every Penny**  
From a price performance perspective, this dripper feels like an investment that pays off in robust coffee quality and convenience. More sustainable than pod machines and less cumbersome than electric brewers, it carves out a unique balance between affordability and functionality. Also, if coffee is an essential part of your lifestyle like it is for me, the time and money saved from skipping cafes justify the cost. Although you might factor in the additional expense of the Kalita-specific wave filters, the brewer itself holds up spectacularly, delivering value without frills but earning a spot in any coffee lover’s arsenal.

Context: 
I (27F) first saw him (29M) during our foundation week. He was with his friend, the guy I actually had a crush on. That was 10 years ago, I think?

The moment our eyes met, it felt like the world stopped. May kuryente. I saw the same spark in his eyes. Nakalimutan ko tuloy na kaya ako nandoon sa engineering building was to peek at his friend. I stalked his friend (ex-crush haha), found him on the friends list, and added him. To my surprise, he accepted agad.

Then a message popped up: (non-verbatim)""I'm glad in-add mo ko, 'cause I've been looking for your FB for hours lol."" Like... sheeet?!

From then on, we talked non-stop, every day for four weeks, until he asked to meet. We clicked instantly. It felt like meeting the boy version of me. He was funny in texts, but even funnier in person. From chatting to hanging out, eating dinner, talking for hours... even making out in random places lol. I also found out he was religious—he’d always stop by a nearby church to pray before taking me home. I was falling. And I knew he was, too.

One night, after praying, he hugged me from behind and whispered, ""Please, be mine. Let’s be official, Baby.""
But I panicked and said no.

Not because I didn’t feel the same. I did. I do. But I was NBSB, and my parents always threatened to pull me out of school if I got a boyfriend. I was terrified. He didn’t seem to take it personally—at least, I thought so. We stayed the same. Still talking, still seeing each other. Our mutual understanding lasted over a year... until one day, he just stopped. No texts. No waiting outside my class. Bigla na lang siyang nawala. Para akong mababaliw sa kakaisip. But I never chased him. Maybe he wasn’t that into me. Maybe nagsawa na siya. I was hurt, but pride and hope that he’d find someone better stopped me from reaching out.

That was 10 years ago. Now, I’m an adult being pressured by my parents to get married (akala ko ba isasako nyo ko? Char!). I’ve had two exes. The first one, our dreams didn’t align, the second cheated. Kaya hirap akong magtiwala ngayon.

Then one morning, while minding my own business, I saw his name pop up in my IG suggested follows. My heart stopped. I clicked “Follow” with shaky hands. He accepted instantly and followed me back.

Then came the message: (non-verbatim)""Buti naman naisipan mo akong i-follow. I was waiting for you to reach out.""

I swear my soul left my body. I stood up, walked around the room in panic. That feeling? Still there. Just buried.

I was so nervous that I stupidly replied, ""Miss mo ko?"". To which he said, he just wanted closure. He admitted ghosting me was wrong, but he felt like I never really wanted him. That I wanted the idea of him, not the commitment. When he left, he was choosing what he thought he deserved. But he also admitted he should’ve handled it better.

Now that we’re older, I get it. We were young. Immature. But we grew apart—and we grew better. He’s a licensed civil engineer now. I’m in med school. Still, I cried. 

Because I still like him.

Maybe it’s the lack of closure. Maybe it’s more than that. I don’t even know if he’s with someone or married. (I hope not). But for years, I know that he's the man that I want to be with, the one I want to marry. I want to tell him everything. That I was afraid, but every part of it was real. That it was never just the idea of him. It was him. 

Then he said:""Do you want to meet? And yes, I missed you. Coffee?""

I haven’t replied. Part of me wants to be brave. Part of me is scared. Should I go?

Coffee isn’t just a drink. It’s a ritual. A mood. A survival mechanism. A friend who shows up every morning like clockwork. But beneath the comforting aroma and the buzz of energy lies a world of opinions, myths, chaos... and maybe a few truths.

Let’s rant. Let’s muse. Let’s dive deep into the swirling brew of caffeine culture.

# 🔍 The Allure of the Brew

From a cozy kitchen nook in Italy to a bustling Paris café, coffee is global, yet deeply personal. Some sip espresso in silence. Others drown in oat milk lattes while doom-scrolling at 7AM. Coffee adapts. Coffee listens. Coffee **never judges**.

But here’s the thing...

# ☠️ Caffeine: Friend or Frenemy?

* **The Buzz**: A delightful dopamine kick when you're dragging your soul through Monday.
* **The Crash**: That inevitable *3PM slump* that no one talks about enough.
* **The Lies**: “I’ll just have one cup.” We all know how that ends.

Science says caffeine improves alertness and mood (yay!), but too much? Jitters, insomnia, existential dread at 2AM. So why do we keep going back?

Because **coffee is comfort**, and caffeine is chaos... beautifully balanced in a ceramic mug.

# 😡 Rants:

* Why is bad coffee even legal?
* Why do people put butter in it? (Yes, *you*, bulletproof folks.)
* Why is decaf still allowed in public?

# 😍 Musings:

* That first sip at sunrise might be the closest thing to enlightenment.
* Coffee dates should be a love language.
* There’s something deeply poetic about a cup of coffee going cold while you’re lost in thought.

With family members who are picky about the taste of water, this filter has been a real game changer for my household. Still, as someone who reviews products regularly, I couldn’t help but test every feature extensively to get the full picture.  

**User-Friendly Installation Experience**

Straight out of the box, this filter's design impressed me. The streamlined setup meant I was able to connect it without requiring any special tools or outside help. I remember one time my niece even helped me install it; that's how simple it was. It fits snugly into the original brand filtration system without any leaks or compatibility issues. The user guide in the box is concise and made it a breeze to dig right in.  

[Check AQUA CREST AQU-RCEZ-1-2 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01l03d16a/)

**Filtration Excellence**

Speaking of performance, this water filter proves its worth by effectively reducing chlorine, taste, odor, and sediment from the water. I could immediately taste the difference in my coffee’s flavor after installing it, as could my coworkers who visited for a cup. The activated carbon technology doesn't compromise the water’s natural minerals, which means I’m getting purified water without sacrificing its health benefits.  

**Long-Lasting Durability**

There’s nothing more irritating than a product that demands replacements frequently. This filter, however, promises longevity—lasting up to 12 months or filtering up to 3,000 gallons. Though I haven’t reached the full 12-month mark, the consistency in water quality is promising. It’s worth noting that the real longevity may vary based on your local water conditions, so keep that in mind.  

**Safe and Reliable Materials**

Safety is something I obsess over, especially when it comes to items that handle food or water. This filter employs food-grade plastic housing, is BPA-free, and meets ANSI and NSF certifications. These factors give me peace of mind since my family is drinking water that’s both clean and entirely free from harmful leaching.

**Assets**

- Effortless installation and compatibility with various systems.  
- High-efficiency filtration for consistently better-tasting water.  
- Durable design lasting up to one year or 3,000 gallons.  

**Drawbacks**

- It doesn’t reduce TDS (total dissolved solids), which might deter some users looking for complete filtration.  
- Requires connection only to the cold-water valve, potentially limiting applications.

**Rivals in the Market**

Having tested products like the Brita USF-201 filter and DuPont WFQTC30001, I found key differences worth mentioning. While Brita offers similar filtration benefits, it didn’t feel as robust in terms of reducing odors as the AQUA CREST model. DuPont’s option, on the other hand, lacked easy installation due to its bulkier design. The AQUA CREST excels particularly for households where simplicity and reliability are priorities. However, those who want additional TDS filtration might look at alternatives from dedicated high-tech brands catering to advanced needs.  

**Bang for the Buck**

The value proposition of this filter truly stands out. With durable service life and dependable filtration capabilities, it’s hard to argue against its cost efficiency. While there are premium options with more comprehensive features, this filter strikes a sweet spot between affordability and quality.

Subtitle: A Hate Bigger and Older Than You Can Imagine

WC: 1,980

All feedback welcome, good and bad.

Bernadette Ashford-Price was a strict, domineering mother who ruled her household the way black coffee, cigarettes, and depression-era dieting dominated her life — absolutely and without question. While her husband, Charles, was off fighting in Vietnam, she was determined to give her two girls every necessity, molding them into the women they were supposed to be. The kind of raising she’d had to give herself.
She observed the image of serenity before her through a vague blue-gray haze of smoke, her golden-haired babies crawling excitedly across the high-pile carpet in a puddle of warm sunlight. The bay window was so blindingly bright it burned, searing the gently waving sycamores into her corneas. She yanked her head away and blinked away the image, refocused on a plush emerald armchair with a back so straight it looked painful. Memories of nursing screaming babies in all night stand-offs floated around the edge of her mind and brought a bilious resentment to the back of her throat. Irritated, Bernadette stood up with a huff, shuffled around the dark mahogany coffee table and sat down hard on the jewel-green cushion. It let out a definitive squeak, as if in agreement.
Bernadette’s new perspective put the bay window at her back and offered a fantastically lit view of the kitchen she hated. It was forever dark no matter how many lights she brought in (thanks to zero windows and the tacky wood-paneling), it was a cramped and shallow space with a maximum occupancy of one, and who in their right mind decided on burnt orange for the countertops?
“It looks like a damn Whataburger in there,” she thought sullenly, taking a drag of cigarette.
The walls of her home, stained from eggshell to warm cream with decades of nicotine, extended out from the kitchen and were almost overburdened with beaming family photos. Frozen smiles of handsome uniformed men, babies in bathtubs, and wedding parties filled out a mismatched collection of frames stacked to the ceiling. The remaining space was claimed by an imposing brass grandfather clock and tchotchkes of varying sizes. They reflected the soft morning glow back on itself, lighting the room like a stage.
Helen, the elder of the two, was patiently explaining to her sister Angela how to properly play “McDonald’s”. Seeing her girls pantomime the mundanity of flipping tiny plastic burgers, making change, and chirping “would you like fries with that?” to imaginary patrons filled her with the deep, visceral urge to be sick all over that high-pile carpet. Her mouth curled down by degrees, betraying her profound disgust. Her daughter would never be caught dead — or alive, for that matter — behind a cash register. Not her Helen. Just a child, yet already so kind, so beautiful, so independent. No, she was destined for greatness and it was obvious from the very day she was born.
“My miracle baby,” Bernadette thought warmly to herself, longing to tuck away a stray spiral of fine hair that had fallen from behind Helen’s ear. A gentle but insistent tug at her leg broke the moment in two. Her gaze snapped to the source — Angela. Her large, bovine eyes were filled with tears and snot threatened to leak from the edge of her nose with every whimpering exhale. She messily used the back of her fist to rub away the wetness on her face, then threw back a wild tangle of hair from her eyes. A wave of revulsion washed over Bernadette before slowly receding, leaving loathing in its wake.
“Angela Marie, that is disgusting!” she spat, horrified eyes glued to the mucus now incorporated into the frizzy mess of her hair, tracking all the way down her shirt. She seized Angela by the elbow and rose to her full height, half-dragging, half-carrying her to the bath.
That day, Angela could have sworn her mother was eight feet tall. The certainty of those memories and feelings collides with the image of the shriveled, gasping husk before her. Silent, carefully trained steps carry her to the bedside and her eyes sharpen, become microscopical. Gentle hands absently smooth the brilliant white sheets and adjust the bundles of tubes and cables coiling from Bernadette’s limbs like so many marionette strings. The deep cushion of the hospital bed nearly swallows her tiny frame whole, like she was too weak to resist even the weight of the thick blankets. Thin, fragile little breaths fog the oxygen mask crookedly set across her sunken and puckered mouth, dried spit crusting in the corners below faint rings of blood around her nostrils. The left half of her face droops sadly while the right remains taught and expectant.
Angela frowns — her mother would never allow anyone to see her this way. The thought alone seems to summon her ghost, whispering in her ear in that raspy, nasally Chicago affect.
“Angela —"" and it is always Angela, not Angie, not any darling pet name, “—you couldn’t throw a little make-up on your dying mother? I don’t need to look like a prostitute but even a little blush. Are you just going to stare at the blood, or are you going to take care of it?”
Haltingly, almost cautiously, she raises a timid hand toward the molded plastic cup of the mask. A desperate, clawing need played out over and over in her mind, keeping pace with the ever-quickening gallop of her heart. Moving the mask aside, Angela lovingly cleans her mother’s face. Her eyes blearily open to find the daughter she never quite connected with waiting dutifully bedside, attentively tending to any needs at the end of her life. Moved, Bernadette tearfully speaks everything Angela has ever needed to hear and the women embrace. End scene.
Lost in the daydream, she begins to feel something beyond the knot in her stomach. Something small and weak, but undeniable. A fledgling nudge of hope. Angela’s trembling hand freezes mid-air as her gaze shifts back up to meet her mother’s closed lids. Bernadette’s icy blue stare was already fixed upon her, one pinned pupil piercing straight through the back of her skull while the other devoured her whole. A jagged whisper barely floats to Angela over the cacophony of beeps and hisses emanating from the towers of equipment that both fed and drained what remained of Bernadette.
Immediately, the push of Angela’s fear became the pull of her need. The chair collides with the guardrail as she yanks it forward to take a seat, leaning within inches of her mother’s face so as not to miss another word. A woman dying of thirst at a dry well.
Bernadette’s emaciated arm thumps under the blanket. Eyes wide, Angela follows its gaunt hand slithering up toward the oxygen mask, the ascent agonizingly laborious. Finally, with great effort, Bernadette paws the plastic away from her mouth and rolls her face toward her youngest. Angela wanted to scream her throat bloody, but didn’t dare to breathe. Their eyes lock, and slowly Bernadette’s quivering lips part. Upon an exhale that stinks of decay came a single question.
“Where’s Helen?”
“Not fucking here!” a wild voice screamed from within, the words drenched in acid. For a long moment, Angela remains statuesque. Her face prickling as if her cheeks had been slapped, eyes burning, she nods. A reply attempts an escape through the tightness of her throat but a hard, dry swallow smothers the words.
An annoying sound is growing in insistence, refusing to remain unknown at the back of Angela’s mind. Her brow furrows; her eyes squeeze shut. A tone — long, steady, final — is devouring the oxygen in the room. Everything snaps into focus with a strong shake of her head, but with that focus comes a horrible knowing. She is too afraid to open her eyes. Not because she knows her mother is dead, but because she is certain that even in death Bernadette’s face reads nothing but contempt. The room hums, its air thick. Absurdly the thought “maybe we can still wake up,” floats to the surface, its buoyancy disrupting the equilibrium of reality. Bernadette’s stopped heart sang out, the note swelling madly until Angela burst and was no more.
The next conscious thought is sideways from a bathroom floor saturated in neon pink light. Fluorescent bulbs crackle in and out of existence, strobing an already deeply confused Angela. Above her, the underside of a chipped toilet and a sink slathered in cheap band stickers swim into view. Angela realizes she is laying on her side in something wet — and then the smell hits; sharp and sour. Like some bloated thing spit up from the ocean, she rolls with slow, shame-drenched inertia out of the puddle she now recognizes as so much vomit. Little lumps of pill were still foaming, still dissolving. The bitter taste at the back of her throat burns its way down her esophagus with a hard swallow. Staggering to her feet, she clutches at the sink and weaves in front of the mirror. She cannot find it in herself to look at what she’s done to her mother’s daughter.
Angela throws herself through a filthy swinging door, emerging in a dingy basement bar that she only half-remembers arriving at. The four patrons of said bar turn their attention from the image-burned television to the shrieking door as it wobbles to a close. Their faces range from bemusement to pitying when they take in this tiny woman with a walking cane, alone, obviously high and covered in sick. Her eyes gaze off in different directions under heavy lids. She begins to wander the floor, muttering about needing her purse.
A sandy-haired sunburnt young man and his two friends lounging at the end of the bar take keen notice of her. Stifled laughter is poorly masked with a forced cough as she seems to fall asleep right where she was standing, jaw slack and eyes half-closed. Beside him, his gigantic curly-haired friend hides a grin behind his meaty and calloused hand while balling up a damp napkin in the other. Within the blink of an eye he stands up on his stool, takes aim, whips it in Angela’s direction, and sits back down — a practiced motion. The projectile hits her neck with a wet slap before tumbling down her front. Delayed and sloppy, her eyes flutter open at the impact. Her arms withdraw to her torso like an ant under a magnifying glass. The young man and his two friends let out hearty guffaws and gulp their drinks.
Angela, in a moment of semi-coherence, attempts to collect her belongings and dignity to make an exit. Her foot slips from its wedge to the sticky floor and she fumbles her newly located purse, dumping its contents and sending her belongings scattering in all directions. She simply stares at the leather heap on the floor dumbly, her vomit-streaked hair dangling like a limp curtain in front of her empty eyes.
She collapses to the ground where she stands, and the laughter comes to an abrupt end. Angela’s shoes slide off of her feet, and her shirt rides up to expose her midriff. Suddenly, it is a race to avert gaze from this pathetic display. Her crumpled form moaning out huge, braying sobs is no longer fun to play with. One by one, the men return to college baseball and Angela is, yet again, left completely alone.",2,1746728684.0,WritersGroup,2,1.0,False

I still feel like hell. I’m really scared that I’m going to end up in the hospital.

Your thoughts feel like they’re stuck in molasses. You reread the same sentence three times and still don’t absorb it. That’s brain fog—and if you’ve had it, you know how frustrating it is.

Brain fog isn’t a medical diagnosis, but it’s very real. People describe it as forgetfulness, poor concentration, slow thinking, or just feeling “off.” It’s like someone dimmed the lights inside your head. And while it’s not dangerous, it can make everyday tasks feel like climbing a hill in flip-flops.

Let’s cut through the haze. What’s really going on when your brain feels foggy, and more importantly—what can you do about it?

[brain fog haze](https://preview.redd.it/hxv903e4nlze1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc9a28e56fbdfc9a5d8dd56fe116d074ecfdbb55)

# What Is Brain Fog, Really?

Brain fog isn’t one specific problem—it’s a symptom. It means your brain isn’t firing on all cylinders. You might feel:

* Mentally sluggish
* Easily distracted
* Foggy or disconnected
* Forgetful or confused
* Like you’re working harder to think clearly

It can last hours, days, or even longer. For some, it’s a once-in-a-while thing. For others, it hangs around like an unwanted guest.

# What Causes Brain Fog?

There’s no single culprit. Brain fog is like smoke—it’s a sign something’s off somewhere, even if the fire isn’t obvious yet. Here are the most [common root causes](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/brain-fog):

# 1. Lack of Sleep

Your brain needs sleep like your phone needs a charger. Without it, your ability to focus, remember, and think clearly drops fast. Most people need 7–9 hours a night. Getting five and trying to power through with coffee is like taping a cracked windshield—you might get by, but not for long.

Sleep also helps clear waste from the brain. If you’re short on sleep, your mental filter gets clogged.

# 2. Poor Diet and Blood Sugar Swings

Your brain uses more energy than any other organ in your body. Feed it junk, and it’ll sputter. Diets high in processed carbs and sugar lead to blood sugar spikes and crashes, which can cause foggy thinking, irritability, and fatigue.

Ever eaten a giant bowl of pasta and wanted to nap an hour later? That’s your brain struggling with the crash.

Lack of key nutrients can also be a problem. Low levels of B vitamins, omega-3s, magnesium, or iron can slow mental processing.

# 3. Chronic Stress

Stress floods your body with cortisol. In short bursts, that’s fine—it helps you handle emergencies. But when cortisol stays high, it wears you down.

Chronic stress can shrink areas of the brain tied to memory and focus. It messes with your sleep. It makes you more likely to crave unhealthy food. Over time, stress creates the perfect conditions for brain fog to set in.

# 4. Sedentary Lifestyle

Your brain loves movement. Physical activity increases blood flow, which delivers oxygen and nutrients. Sitting for long periods without moving much? That slows everything down, including your thinking.

Exercise also boosts [mood-regulating chemicals](https://thirdagewellness.com/cognitive-conditions/cognitive-conditions.aspx) like dopamine and serotonin. Less movement means lower energy and a more sluggish mind.

# 5. Hormonal Changes

Hormones play a big role in brain function. During pregnancy, menopause, or thyroid imbalance, people often report foggy thinking. Estrogen, in particular, affects memory and cognition, which is why some women feel mentally “off” during hormonal shifts.

And low thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) is notorious for making you feel tired, slow, and foggy.

# 6. Mental Overload

Trying to do too many things at once—or constantly switching tasks—takes a toll. Your brain isn't designed to multitask well. Every time you switch focus, it has to reset.

[Information overload](https://www.dmc.org/healthy-living/corporate-content/when-should-you-worry-about-brain-fog) also leaves little room for clear thinking. If your mind feels like a browser with 100 tabs open, brain fog is almost guaranteed.

# 7. Medication and Health Conditions

Some medications list “brain fog” or “mental cloudiness” as a side effect. Antihistamines, sedatives, and certain antidepressants can all contribute.

Autoimmune conditions like lupus or multiple sclerosis often include cognitive symptoms. Even long COVID has put brain fog in the spotlight. If the fog is severe or persistent, it’s worth discussing with a doctor.

# How to Fix Brain Fog

The good news? Brain fog is often reversible. Start treating your brain like the high-performance engine it is, and clarity can return.

Here’s what works:

# 1. Prioritize Consistent, Quality Sleep

Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. Keep screens out of the bedroom. Cut caffeine after early afternoon. It sounds basic, but sleep hygiene makes a big difference.

If you're waking up groggy even after 8 hours, you might need to look into sleep apnea or other disturbances.

# 2. Eat Like Your Brain Depends on It (Because It Does)

Focus on:

* Protein-rich foods (eggs, fish, legumes)
* Omega-3 fats (salmon, walnuts, flaxseed)
* Leafy greens and colorful vegetables
* B-vitamin-rich foods (whole grains, avocados)
* Plenty of water—dehydration mimics fatigue and fog

Minimize refined sugar and processed foods. Try eating smaller meals more frequently if you’re prone to energy crashes.

# 3. Move Your Body Daily

You don’t need to run marathons. Even 20–30 minutes of walking, stretching, or dancing helps. Exercise boosts blood flow, improves mood, and clears out mental cobwebs.

If you're working at a desk, try standing up every hour and moving around for a few minutes.

# 4. Reduce Stress—Without Just Powering Through

Stress relief looks different for everyone. Try:

* Deep breathing exercises
* Journaling
* Taking short nature walks
* Listening to music that calms you
* Saying “no” to nonessential obligations

Even short breaks help reset your mental energy. You’re not a machine—stop expecting yourself to run like one.

# 5. Cut Digital Distractions

Limit screen time when possible. Set app limits, turn off non-essential notifications, and use “focus” modes on your phone or computer.

Your brain works best with [periods of deep focus](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/94/4/321) followed by real breaks. Try the 50/10 method: 50 minutes of focused work, 10 minutes of rest.

# 6. Try Brain-Friendly Supplements (But Be Selective)

Some people find relief from supplements like:

* **Omega-3 fatty acids** (DHA and EPA)
* **L-theanine** (a calming compound from green tea)
* **Rhodiola rosea** (an adaptogen that supports energy)
* **Citicoline** (linked to improved focus and memory)

Supplements aren’t magic pills, but they can help support brain function—especially when paired with better habits.

# 7. Know When to Ask for Help

If brain fog doesn’t lift despite lifestyle changes, it might be linked to a deeper issue—like depression, anxiety, thyroid dysfunction, or a nutrient deficiency.

There’s no shame in asking for help. Your brain is too important to ignore when it’s waving a red flag.

Brain fog feels like you're walking through mental soup—thick, slow, and frustrating. But it’s not a permanent state. Your brain responds well to care, consistency, and patience.

Start with one small change. Go to bed 30 minutes earlier. Swap one sugary snack for a handful of nuts. Get outside for ten minutes of sunshine. The fog may not lift overnight, but it will clear—bit by bit—until you feel sharp, focused, and yourself again.",1,1746728291.0,u_Klutzy_Sail5986,0,1.0,False

In the golden age of cryptocurrency, convenience is king. Whether you're a seasoned Bitcoin HODLer or just made your first crypto-curious move, chances are you've bumped into a Bitcoin ATM somewhere between the coffee shop and your favorite late-night taco spot. These magical machines let you trade cash for BTC (and sometimes vice versa) faster than your uncle can yell, “It’s all a scam!”

But there's another sidekick helping this decentralized revolution hum along smoothly: [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)—a nifty little app that lets anyone generate slick, professional Bitcoin QR codes. Let’s dive into how these two tools—the burly ATM and the sleek QR code—are changing the way we handle digital money.

# What the Fork is a Bitcoin ATM?

If you've never used one, a Bitcoin ATM might sound like a prop from a sci-fi movie. But they’re real, and they’re multiplying fast—like rabbits on a blockchain. These kiosks look like regular ATMs, but instead of dispensing cash from your checking account, they’re gateways into the decentralized world of Bitcoin.

There are two main types:

1. **One-way ATMs**: These allow you to buy Bitcoin using cash or a debit card.
2. **Two-way ATMs**: These let you buy AND sell Bitcoin for cash, giving you a full-service experience with zero need for a traditional bank.

So how does it work? You walk up, tap a few buttons, scan your Bitcoin wallet address (this is where our QR code maker shines!), insert your cash, and boom—you’ve just added digital gold to your stash.

# The Unseen Hero: The QR Code

Before the BTC fairy dust lands in your wallet, there’s one key ingredient in the transaction: the wallet address. If you’ve ever tried typing out a Bitcoin address manually, you know it’s about as fun as assembling IKEA furniture without the manual. It’s a long, complex string of characters—case-sensitive and unforgiving.

That’s where [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) comes in. This app lets you convert any Bitcoin address into a clean, scannable QR code. Just type in your BTC address, click a button, and you’ve got a professional-grade QR code ready to use. You can even customize it to include a payment amount or label, which is ideal for vendors, freelancers, and donation pages.

And here's the kicker: Bitcoin ATMs *love* QR codes. In fact, it’s the default method for telling the machine where to send your newly purchased Bitcoin. No typos. No tears. Just scan and go.

# The Secret Sauce for Businesses

Let’s say you run a food truck or a boutique coffee shop. You’re trendy, forward-thinking, and you want to accept Bitcoin. Great! But how do you make it easy for your customers?

Simple: use [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) to generate a payment QR code. Print it, slap it near the register, or add it to your receipts. Boom—you’re now a high-tech café accepting magic internet money like a boss.

You can even set it to request a fixed amount of BTC. Want to sell a $5 latte? Convert that to satoshis and let the QR do the math. Your customers just scan, confirm, and sip. No wires. No terminals. No drama.

# QR Codes Meet ATMs: The Power Duo

Now here’s where the real fun begins. Imagine this:

You’re at a music festival. The sun is shining, people are vibing, and you stumble upon a booth selling epic Bitcoin-themed merch. The vendor accepts Bitcoin only. You open your wallet app and realize—you’re short on BTC. No worries! A Bitcoin ATM is nearby.

You walk over, scan your own QR code (generated earlier from [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)), insert some cash, and instantly receive BTC in your wallet. Then you march back, scan the vendor’s payment QR code, and snag the last ""Satoshi is my homeboy"" shirt. That’s 21st-century commerce, baby.

# Bitcoin for the People

Not everyone has access to a bank account, but almost everyone has a smartphone. That’s why Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes are revolutionizing finance for the unbanked and underbanked. They create an on-ramp into the crypto economy without the need for traditional gatekeepers.

Someone can walk up with cash, scan a QR code generated on [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), and have Bitcoin in minutes. From there, they can send it, save it, or spend it—all without asking permission from a bank manager or dealing with a credit score.

It’s borderless. It’s permissionless. It’s glorious.

# Use Cases You Didn't Think Of

QR codes and Bitcoin ATMs aren’t just for individuals and businesses. Here are a few creative use cases:

* **Charity Donations**: Post a QR code at events or on flyers. Instant, traceable donations.
* **Artists and Musicians**: Accept tips at live shows by displaying your QR code.
* **Events and Conferences**: Hand out QR codes with BTC incentives or NFTs.
* **Street Vendors**: Turn any table into a crypto-friendly station with a laminated QR code.

All thanks to the magic of [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and your friendly neighborhood Bitcoin ATM.

# Future-Proof Yourself

As Bitcoin adoption continues to rise (hello, spot ETFs, institutional interest, and Layer 2 tech), having a grasp on these simple tools will set you apart. You don’t need to be a coder or a crypto OG. Just know how to scan a code and press a few buttons.

Bitcoin ATMs give you access. Bitcoin QR codes give you clarity. Together, they create a user-friendly, fast-moving ecosystem that anyone can jump into—whether you’re buying tacos, accepting donations, or selling merch at a street fair.

So the next time you see a Bitcoin ATM, don’t just walk past it. Think of it as a mini portal to a decentralized future. And when you need a QR code, you know where to go: [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

The idea is super simple but powerful. You take a habit you already do regularly, like brushing your teeth or making coffee, and you “stack” a new habit onto it. For example, right after making your morning coffee, you might write down three things you're grateful for or stretch for five minutes.

This works because your brain already recognizes the first habit as automatic. By attaching something new to it, you're more likely to stick with the new habit too, no extra willpower needed. Studies show this method makes new behaviors easier to remember and harder to skip.

I’ve been trying it myself lately, and honestly, it’s made habit-building feel a lot less overwhelming. Have you tried habit stacking?",1,1746728114.0,PersonalGrowthGoals,0,1.0,False

Part 1  
  The VFW bar was starting to warm. The air conditioner behind the bar was heroically and noisily trying to do its job. A grey-bearded vet in his mid-seventies, sporting an olive drab baseball cap with a US flag over a much smaller yellow flag with three red horizontal stripes and 68 - 69, was circulating and garrulously making small talk with the patrons.

  
  A teenage girl had just finished setting up a small orange battered speaker/amp combo, mic, and stool. Her guitar case lay open on the riser just as it had a week before at the park. The girl looked older than she was. With her auburn hair cut short, dressed in a black stretch top, black skinny jeans, and dark, dark blue ballet slippers one might have mistaken her as nineteen or twenty instead of three or four years younger.

  
  Sitting at a corner table near the fireplace, near three slot machines, a woman and two girls were talking. The girls were identical twins. Hardly anyone ever noticed any difference between them except that Celise was the more vocal. Celise tended to blurt out at inappropriate times and was much louder and more expressive than her slightly older sibling Suzette. When they were born eight years ago, the doctor had boasted he’d never seen two more beautiful babies. True, there had been some complications delivering the second twin but, mom had been assured that even with the difficult delivery, Celise would be a perfectly normal little girl. With nearly platinum blond hair, blue-eyed, lithe, and tall dressed in their matching peasant blouses, they looked like Nordic bookends.  
  
  “Mommy, why can’t I have a burger?”  
  
  “Celise, I told you it’s Taco Tuesday. Be quiet and wait for your dinner.”  
  
Celise rolled her eyes, huffed, and pouted. "" I want a burger!”  
  
  “I have a nice beef taco coming for you. You can think of it as a barbeque sandwich. They’re letting us eat for free tonight. I want you to sit here and stay quiet with Suzette while I get Annabelle set up for her performance.”  
Annabelle sat on her high stool head down intently focused on tuning her guitar. She flinched and trembled a bit when she realized that Mom was standing in front of her.  
  
  ""Relax honey, just do what you’ve been doing during practice. You’re ready for this. You did great singing in the park the other day. I’ll be sitting over at the bar on the corner."" Mom grinned insincerely, ""Just give me a look if you’re having trouble or need a break.”  
  
  “I know Mom, but do you still think it’s OK for me to do this in a bar? I mean I’m only 16. I don’t want you to get in trouble.”  
  
  “If the post commander is OK with it then we're OK. Just look at this as experience, something to build off of. Just play the songs in the order we set up and try to remember the small talk we agreed on and it’ll be fine.”  
  
  Mom turned and sat down next to a man sitting by himself near the corner where she’d set her glass of seltzer. She smoothed her hair, straightened her posture, with her chest out, turned, and smiled brightly at him.  
  
  A tiny spotlight turned on and Annabelle's face glistened slightly not merely with the warmth of the bar. She forced a smile.  
  
  ""Good evening, my name is Annabelle. I'm going to sing you some songs tonight. My first song is probably familiar to you."" She quietly said while she strummed two or three chords and started singing. A few of the patrons looked up from their drinks and stopped talking.  
  
*I like this bar... We got winners, We got losers....*  
  
  Celise stared at her taco plater for a few seconds before making a face and pushing it away. Suzette smiled as she chewed her chicken taco making sure to smack her lips loudly while chewing. Celise started to turn in her chair while swinging her legs to stand up. Suzette gripped her wrist and shook her head. After a brief struggle to get her arm back, Celise yanked her arm away leaned back in her seat, and crossed her arms. Across the room, Mom smiled slightly while listening to the man next to her.  
  
*Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, I just love this old bar.*  
  
  ""I don't know why that's one of my favorites, I mean I'm only 16,"" Annabelle said as a large man with a grey crewcut and a Semper Fi tattoo on his right forearm dropped a five in the guitar case. She smiled self-consciously at the man. He nodded slightly.  
  
  Annabelle strummed a bit and took a drink from the bottle of Springwater at her elbow. ""My mom plays this one all the time at home I hope you like this as much as I do.""  
  
*Ooh-ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew*  
*'Bout your plans to make me blue...*  
  
  A tall lanky guy with longish grey streaked hair and some sort of black ribbon or banner tattoo peeking out from under the sleeve of his t-shirt on his left shoulder rose from his seat at the bar and dropped a couple of fives in the case at Annabelle's feet. She shyly smiled and nodded. Mom giggled as the guy sitting next to her told her a joke. Celise and Suzette started to clap loudly and sway. Mom got up and walked over to the girl's table to check on them.  
  
  ""Girls be quiet, let Annabelle sing. She's working hard tonight.""  
  
  ""Aw, Mom, all she's doing is singing. She does that all the time at home."" Celise moaned. Suzette nodded vigorously.  
  
  ""Please keep quiet and don't disturb your sister while she's working.""  
  
*Ooh, I'm just about to lose my mind*  
*Honey, honey, yeah...I heard it through the grapevine.*  
  
  The entire bar applauded. A couple of men walked up and threw loose change and bills in the guitar case. Annabelle got up and smiled. She hurried to the bar and whispered something to the bartender who pointed to a hallway in the corner across from the bar. She quickly headed that way.  
  
  Annabelle returned to the dais and her stool. She ran up and down the chords a few times and started to sing. Billy Joel's *The Piano Man.*  
  
  There was a smattering of applause.  
  
  The two sisters in the corner nudged each other when they saw Mom leaning close to the stranger sitting next to her. She smiled and blushed when he whispered in her ear. They both started pointing at Mom and started giggling loudly. Mom looked back at them and sternly shook her head, frowning. The girls started to shove each other until Mom vigorously shook her head. Suzette shrugged and went back to consuming her tacos and beans. Celise sat back crossed her arms and frowned at her mom.  
  
  Suzette, having finished her tacos and beans put her head down on the table Celise copied her and promptly started to feign snoring. Mom got up from her seat and crossed the bar to nudge them both and ask if they were ok. They both sat up quickly grinning and laughing. Mom looked like she was going to get angry but she just turned and walked away.  
  
  Annabelle finished two more sets, Mom grudgingly got up to help her pack up. The post-commander came over and handed Mom a small envelope. Mom smiled and shook his hand. Mom returned to her corner seat and shook the hand of her drinking partner of the evening. Her drinking companion looked surprised when they shook until he looked at the small, folded paper in his hand. Mom turned around to gather her daughters. He shrugged and smiled as he slipped the paper into his wallet.  
  
  With the equipment packed up, Mom had the twins help Annabelle carry it out. Celise feigned like she was struggling under a monstrous weight as she dragged Annabelle's music stand towards the door. Suzette proudly hugged the guitar case as she followed Celise out the door to the SUV.  
  
  When they got to the late model Escalade Celise started up again.  
  
   ""Mommy, I'm hungry. I just couldn't eat that terrible taco. I have to have something to eat. Is there a McDonald's on the way home? I'm hungry, I really am.""  
  
  ""Celise, you never touched it. You just shoved it away."" said Suzette. ""My chicken taco was great, probably the best I've ever had.""  
  
  ""Mom, could we stop on the way home? I didn't have a chance to eat before I sang because I was too nervous. If maybe I could grab a donut and a cup of decaf?"" Annabelle asked.  
  
  ""Sure, honey, I understand."" Mom shook her head as she looked in the mirror at Celise. ""Celise, I am very upset with you. You can have an orange or an apple. You should have eaten that dinner the post-commander gave you, he was very nice to have done that.  
  
  "" You're mean to me, just plain rotten mean to me. I hate you, Mom! I don't want fruit, I want a burger!""  
  
  ""That's nice dear, I don't feel all that fond of you right now.,"" Mom said grinning.  
  
  Annabelle laughed, Suzette poked her sister in the ribs and said, "" I told you so. I told you to eat that taco."" Celise crossed her arms and pouted.  
  
  Mom turned into the driveway twenty minutes later. She turned and looked at the twins, "" Girls, help your sister in with her equipment. I'll be down in a second I have to pee.""  
  
  When mom came down Annabelle was sitting on one of the two folding chairs in the living room finishing her coffee. The room looked strange without a couch, without any paintings, and with the lamp on the step stool. The room looked naked. The twins were lying on the floor.  
  
  ""All the stuff's in Mom. I made sure the car was locked. I'm going to bed. ""  
  
  ""Wait a minute, will you? I have to talk with you all.""  
  
  ""Can't it wait, Mom? I'm still hungry and it's all your fault.""  
  
  ""That's enough Celise.""  
  
  ""Celise, I told you mommy would be angry that you didn't eat!""  
  
  ""Shut up snitch.""  
  
  ""Mom, what did you want to tell us? I have to get up early tomorrow. I have a test to take."" Annabelle said quietly.  
  
  ""In a minute Annie. Girls, you have to be a little understanding. I'm doing the best I can. We have to work together. You three have to help me out. That means no more arguing, you clean up after yourselves, you study without being told, and generally, you give me some space to find a job.""  
  
  ""Ok Mom, we'll try,"" said Annabelle. Suzette nodded vigorously.  
  
  ""Thank you, girls. Things have changed, changed a lot.""  
  
  ""When we getting a TV? It's not fair we don't have one anymore!"", moaned Celise.  
  
  Mom just shook her head.  
  
  
Part 2.  
  
  Annabelle hesitated before entering the Glenside High School cafeteria wall of noise. She had arrived late as she nearly always did. She maneuvered around the table of sports teammates throwing fries at each other. Self-consciously she walked past the cheerleaders attempting to look disinterested in everything while at the same time watching to see if anyone was observing them.  
  
  The cafeteria workers in the sandwich line, pizza line, salad line, taco line, and ala carte line were ladling, slicing, passing, tossing, tallying, and making change with apparently efficient ease. Annabelle waited patiently for the others to line up before taking a place at the end of the salad line. Martha, a little doughy, mahogany brown, middle-aged, grey-headed, server smiled when she saw Annabelle struggling with her heavily laden backpack, acoustical guitar case, and tray.  
  
  ""Annie, how you doing?"", shaking her head, ""You know it would be so much easier if you just parked that guitar somewhere.""  
  
  ""I know, Martha. But it wouldn't feel right dumping just anywhere. I'd feel naked without it.""  
  
Martha shrugged, ""Your usual, Annie?""  
  
  ""Yes, please, could I have some extra napkins too?""  
  
  Martha proceeded to cram Romaine lettuce, carrot shavings, bacon bits, a couple of cucumber slices, croutons, a couple of cherry tomatoes, chopped chicken bits, and grated cheese, drowned in bleu cheese dressing, into a medium-sized clear clamshell container and handed it to Annabelle.  
  
  ""Annie, how'd your test go? ""  
  
  ""I'm not sure, I think I passed. I really don't like speech class. I always feel uncomfortable with public speaking. Thank you, Martha."" she said while sliding two fifty across the counter to Liza, who rang up the salad.  
  
   As she turned to leave, Martha called her back, ""Annie, we over-ordered on the rolls. Take this so we don't have to throw it out tomorrow. Don't forget to pick up some butter.""  
  
  Annabelle ate with her head down, focusing on her salad and roll. She didn't notice when the young man sat down in front of her. He cleared his throat. Annabelle flinched when she looked up and found him sitting across from her.  
  
  ""You're Annabelle, right? You're in Mr. Lymon's third-period social studies class, right? I'm Josh. "" He said while extending his hand.  
  
  Annabelle sat for a minute looking at him and his extended hand. Timidly nodding, she reached out and weakly shook his hand.  
  
  ""This has been some year, hasn't it? I mean, with our going to State and all last fall. I didn't get all that much time in the game, but I still got a couple of days out of this place to go downstate for the championship. I mean, I didn't really worry about playing in the big game all that much. It's not like I'll be playing college ball or anything. I'm not big enough to play college-level offensive guard. I'm joining the Marines anyway. Do you carry that case around with you all the time? Seems kinda awkward to have to deal with that and your backpack all the time. ""  
  
  ""Sorry, I've never been all that interested in sports. My father was but he's been gone for a year and a half.""  
  
  ""I'm sorry to hear that. 





what did he die of?""  
  
  ""He's not dead, he just left. My parents are getting a divorce. Sometimes I do wish he'd die, though.""  
  
  ""Hey, Josh!! Whatcha' doing?"", Jimmy yelled over in an exaggerated falsetto from the player's table.  
  
  Annabelle started to gather her things.  
  
  ""Hey, don't go. Jimmy's just messing around. I'd kinda like to hear you play that thing.""  
  
  ""I don't think so. I'm really not all that good.""  
  
  "" Hey, why not? We can go out in the commons, and you could play for me. Coach always says you can't do better if you don't practice. Just look at it as practice. I mean, really, we have another 25 minutes before we have to get to class. ""  
  
  Annie stood and started to turn away.  
  
   ""Listen, Annie, I'd really appreciate it if you'd play something for me. You don't know me that well, but I'd really like to hear you play. We could sit in the commons area for a bit. ""  
  
  Annie shrugged and nodded while looking at the floor. Josh grabbed both their trays and walked them over to the return nook. He retrieved his backpack from the team table grabbed her bag, and followed Annie into the commons. There was no place to sit so they spread out in the corner on the carpet. Annabelle avoided eye contact with Josh while she uncased her worn Fender. She ran up and down a few chords. Starting slowly she played *Green Sleeves.*  
  
  Josh blurted out, ""Hey I know that one. Lymon played that when we studied England last fall. Some king wrote that, Henry something, he was the one that killed all his wives.""  
  
  ""No one really knows who wrote it or first sang it. It's very old though."" Annabelle smiled.  
  
  ""There I knew you could smile. You should do it more often.""  
  
  Annabelle played a few chords from *Dueling Banjos*. She then started playing *Foggy Mountain Breakdown*. She focused intently on the fretting, so much so that when she looked up she shuddered a bit to realize that a half dozen others had gathered around Josh and were also seated on the carpet. Annabelle composed herself and quickly the tune morphed into It *Don't Mean a Thing*. A couple of the kids swayed to the beat.  
  
   Josh stated, ""You're just showing off now.""  
  
  Annabelle looked him in the eyes and grinned.  
  
  It *Don't Mean a Thing* slid into *Tequila*. There was a smattering of applause. She did a brief pause in the tune, Josh and half the other students shouted out Tequila.  
  
  Her audience minus Josh started to gather up their book bags and head for the Commons door. Josh grabbed her bag and his while the bell rang. They got up and slowly walked towards the Commons doorway.  
  
  ""Annie, what you doing Friday night? I'd like to take you out we could catch a movie. What do you think? Could you let me have your phone number? I'd really like to call you. I mean if you can't make it Friday night how about Saturday night? I mean I'd really like to take you out. What do you say?""  
  
  Annabelle stopped suddenly. She slowly shook her head. ""No, I can't do that. I've got an engagement both evenings.""  
  
  ""What kind of engagement? Are you seeing someone? I mean if you're going out with someone else, I understand...""  
  
  ""I'd really like to go out with you. Thanks for asking, but I'll be singing at the VFW Friday evening and at the Legion Hall Saturday.""  
  
  ""Great, make it Sunday then. I'll pick you up after I get out of church. They have me ushering this Sunday. How does eleven sound? We can go to lunch or brunch or whatever. Please don't say no again.""  
  
  They continued down the hall. Annabelle walked and watched Josh while broadly smiling, Josh continued to talk nervously.  
  
  Two men had intently watched Annabelle's performance from a tall check-in table near the entrance of the commons area.  
  
  ""She's the one I was going to recommend for an audition. She isn't one of my regular students but she's always asking to sign up for practice booths. I don't normally sign them out to students not on a class roster but I make an exception for Annie. She deserves to be in one of our extracurricular groups but her family is going through a rough time right now. Seems that her father had a midlife crisis and abandoned his wife and three daughters. I've heard that her mom has her performing at a couple of bars in the area. "" Mr. Scott explained.  
  
  ""We still have a few privately funded scholarships available. She'd have to audition to qualify for admittance. Then she'll have to apply for the scholarship. Could someone in your department help her with that? That and your recommendation should go a long way. She'll probably need your assistance picking out an audition piece too."", Mr. Michaels said.  
  
  ""I'll ask Joyce if she's advising anyone this afternoon. I'm sure she'll agree to walk Annie through the paperwork. I'll work with Annie on the audition material. Her mother, she might be a problem but we'll deal with that when we come to it. I'll see if I can get her out of class sixth period. I should have you out of here before rush hour.""  
  
  ""Sounds like a plan. Now about that Vietnamese place you were talking about. It's your turn to pay.""  
  
  
  ""Annie have a seat, Mr. Scott will be back in a minute.""  
  
  ""Miss Parker, do you know what he wants? I'm missing a lab in Home Ec.""  
  
"" No idea, it must be important. Mrs. Scott will be in the meeting too.""  
  
  Mr. Scott, Mrs. Scott, and a man she'd never met walked in a moment later.  
  
  ""Annie, don't look so worried. You're not in trouble. I want you to meet Mr. Michaels. He's a very good friend of mine and Mrs. Scott. He runs the Burnham School of the Performing Arts in the city. He'd like to talk with you a bit."" Mr. Scott smiled.  
  
Part 3.  
  
  ""Annie, come to the kitchen. I have to talk with you!"" Mom called as Annabelle walked in the front door.  
  
  "" Mom, you won't believe what happened today. I met the most fantastic guy! His name is Josh. He wants to take me out this weekend. He likes my music, he has a car, and he's a senior too. What is it, Mom?""  
  
  Mom was loading the breakfast dishes in the dishwasher. Annabelle shook her head when she noticed a half bottle of vodka on the counter and that Mom was loading what she affectionately called her *HighBall* glass.  
  
  "" We'll talk about the boy in a minute. Mr. Scott called today."" Mom turned toward the sink and started aggressively washing her hands. ""He says you have a chance for a spot at some arts academy in the city. You know we can't afford anything like that. Why did you tell him you were interested?""  
  
  ""Mom, I didn't ask to talk to them, Mr. Scott recommended me to Mr. Michaels. Mr. Michaels told me I have a chance at a........""  
  
  ""I know, I know, a chance on a place at some arts academy. You also have responsibilities to this family! You're booked to perform at the Legion Hall and the post for the foreseeable future! You know that I'm also working hard on getting you a gig at a real lounge!""  
  
  ""No! You're not listening, I didn't ask to talk to them! They asked to see me! They want to see that I get a scholarship. They say I have real talent, all I have to do is audition and submit a few forms to the school. Mr. Michaels says I have an excellent chance to succeed at Burnham.""  
  
  ""Don't raise your voice to me, young lady. I'm doing my best to hold this family together and find a job.""  
  
  ""Only I'm the one bringing in a couple hundred a week singing at bars and parks! I'm sixteen Mom! Don't I deserve a life? My own life?""  
  
  The slap surprised Annabelle. She'd seldom been spanked or slapped for that matter. Regardless, she didn't cry. She refused to let her mom have the satisfaction of seeing her cry.  
  
  That evening at dinner the twins were subdued, they sensed the friction between their sibling and Mom. Wednesday's meal was tensely polite.  
  
Part 4.  
  
  The varsity football team had been given Thursday off to play golf. Glenside High's tradition was that senior-class athletes were allowed one official ditch day to celebrate the end of their high school sports careers. Annie was frustrated, she couldn't find Josh at school. She considered calling him to tell him what had happened but had stopped herself twice.  
  
  Friday went as expected for an end-of-week, end-of-year day. Neither the students nor the teacher's hearts seemed to be fully committed to attending school. Each group seemed to be counting down the hours and days until summer break.  
  
  For the second day in a row, she hadn't heard from Josh. Hardly a senior student could be found on campus. Monday was the official senior ditch day. It appeared as if most seniors had decided to make a four-day weekend of it. Annie was concerned; she was unsure as to whether or not they were still on for Sunday.  
  
  Her heart was not in her performance Friday night. She did her usual sets. Her mother had barely spoken to her on the drive over or back. Surprisingly, the twins had behaved themselves.  
  
  Saturday, she tried to focus on an English project she'd asked for extra time on. It was difficult to stay on task, her major fear was that Josh had forgotten about their plans. She didn't want to perform at the Legion Hall, but she'd given her word.  
  
  Just as she finished setting up for her performance, she saw Josh walk in with a slightly older guy. He smiled and waved as they sat down. The older of the two went to the bar and ordered a beer and a Coke for Josh.  
  
  Annabelle ran through a few chords before she started her first song.  
  
  ""Good evening, I'm Annabelle. I'm going to sing a few songs for you tonight. I have to say this is a really good-looking audience tonight. I hope you enjoy the show. My first song is one that I'm sure you've heard before.....""  
  
*I like this bar... We got winners, We got losers....*  
  
  There was a smattering of applause. She felt she was playing the best she ever had. Her fingers floated over the frets. She was as relaxed as if she was practicing in her bedroom. When the song was over several people came up with tips. She cleared her throat and ran through the chords again.  
  
  ""I'm going to mix it up tonight. I'm going to play a tune that I'm sure the older crowd is familiar with. It's a tune by a gentleman named Gershwin. It's called *Someone to Watch Over Me*.""  
  
*There's a saying old says that love is blind*  
*Still we're often told ""seek and ye shall find""*  
*So I'm going to seek a certain boy I've had in mind*  
*Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet*  
*He's the big affair I cannot forget*  
*Only boy I ever think of with regret.*  
  
  Mom had been quietly watching and listening to Annabelle's performance. Now Mom was sitting up straight and listening intently and vigorously shaking her head. She mouthed "" What are you doing?"" Annabelle ignored her. The bar got surprisingly quiet while she sang. She was amazed at how at ease she felt. She didn't feel nervous at all. Watching Josh she felt she could do anything.  
  
*Won't you tell him please to put on some speed*  
*Follow my lead, oh how I need*  
*Someone to watch over me*  
*Someone to watch over me*  
  
  The audience clapped enthusiastically. Annie put her guitar down and left the dais. Her mother caught up to her halfway to the washroom.  
  
  ""Young lady, will you tell me just what you think you're doing? That is not our usual lineup. ""  
  
"" No Mom, it's not. It's my program, my lineup. I'm the one performing. I read the room and changed my mind. ""  
  
  ""Listen to me, you will play what we agreed upon...""  
  
  ""Or what, Mom? Are you going to take my place? I'm going to go back out there and do the show the way I want to. Hey, don't worry Mom, they seem to like it so far.""  
  
  Returning to the dais, she adjusted her mic and strummed a few random chords.  
  
  "" I want to try out another new piece tonight. Some here might have heard it before, it's an oldie but a goodie. It's called *Straight On* by the Wilson sisters, otherwise known as Heart, and their writing partner, Susan Ennis. "" she started keeping time with her right foot while she launched into the song.  
  
*Quite some time, I been sittin' it out*  
*Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt*  
*I knocked down the wailin' wall, ain't no sin*  
*Got the feel of fortune, deal me in*  
  
  She watched Josh's reaction as she sang. He lifted his head off his hands and grinned.  
  
*Comin' straight on for you*  
*You made my mind*  
*Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through*  
*Straight on, straight on for you*  
*Straight on for you*  
  
  Mom looked at Annie and then at Josh and vigorously shook her head. Annabelle ignored her.  
  
*Now I know I got to play my hand*  
*What the winner don't know, a gambler understands*  
*My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend*  
*I'll take my chances on you again and again, again*  
  
  Mom sat tapping her nails on the bar while fidgeting on her stool.  
  
*You made my mind*  
*Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through*  
*Straight on, straight on for you*  
*Straight on, straight on*  
*I'm straight on for you*  
*Straight on for you*  
  
  Annie finished the final chord of her song slung her guitar out of the way and stood to stretch. She took a few sips of water, she adjusted her mic and continued to stand.  
  
  ""For my last song of this set, I'd like to perform a song by a couple of artists named Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart commonly known as the Eurythmics.""  
  
*How many sorrows*  
*Do you try to hide*  
*In a world of illusion*

  Mom sat with her arms crossed glaring at Annie.

  
*That's covering your mind*  
  
  Josh continued to stare at Annie with a goofy, smitten grin on his face.  
  
*I'll show you something good.*  
  
  Most of the patrons were quiet while listening to the song.  
  
*Oh, I'll show you something good.*  
*The miracle of love*  
*Will take away your pain*  
*When the miracle of love*  
*Comes your way again.*  
  
  ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to take a short break, please stick around for the next set. Also, please remember to buy a drink or two.""  
Annabelle put her guitar on its stand and walked over to Josh's table ignoring her mother sitting at the bar.  
  
  ""Josh, I'm so happy you could make it. Who's this good-looking guy?"", Annie asked.  
  
  ""This is my brother Jack. I brought him along so I wouldn't get kicked out."" Josh grinned.  
  
  ""Glad to meet you, Jack."" she firmly shook his hand, ""Excuse me Jack could I borrow Josh? Josh, could we talk for a minute, please?""  
  
  ""Sure, Annie. Is that your mom over there? She looks pissed.""  
  
  ""Yeah, that's her, she is, but at me, not you. I have to get back soon, I want to ask you two important things.""  
  
  ""Sure, whatever. Anything I can do to help."", Josh shrugged.  
  
  ""First, are we still on for Sunday? If so where are we going? Next, I know this is asking a lot, but could you drive me downtown sometime next week? I'm trying to get an audition at a performing arts school in the city.""  
  
  ""Sure, I'll drive you, I won't start my job for another week."" Josh smiled. ""As for Sunday, why don't we try the Rib Fest in Riverdale? I hear they've got a jazz concert Sunday afternoon. I'll pick you up around 12.""

  
  Mom caught her on her way back to the dais. ""Just what are you cooking up with that boy?""

  
  ""Mom I've decided, I'm going to audition for that school whether you like it or not. The sooner I get out of the house the better. If I'm able to get the scholarship it looks like you'll have to get a real job."" She said defiantly.  
  
Part 5.  
  
  Wednesday, the following week.

  Josh and Annie were sitting in a paneled hallway outside an auditorium. Annabelle was contemplating a poem she'd just read that was engraved in the paneling across from the auditorium.  
  
  
*Burnham*  
*Plan small live small*  
*Plan big you are sure to live to the fullest*  
*Plan small always regret*  
*Plan big you’re not liable to apologize*  
  
  
*Plan small live small*  
*Plan big never I should’ve could’ve would’ve*  
*Plan small always obscure*  
*Plan big the timid never leave their mark*  
  
  
*Plan small live small*  
*Plan big you’ll always be remembered*  
*Plan small be forgotten*  
*Plan big the important make no small plans.*  
  
  Josh interrupted her train of thought, "" I told you we'd get here on time. I drive down here all the time for my summer job. What's up with your mother? I can't believe how pissed off she was. She acted like you had stolen from her.""  
  
  ""I guess from her viewpoint, I did. If I pass this audition, Mr. Scott and Mr. Michaels say I have an excellent chance of winning the scholarship. I'll attend school here and she'll be stuck dealing with the twins. She'll finally have to get a job. I'm nervous. This audition is a really big deal.""  
  
  ""You'll do great. Just stay relaxed it'll go fine. This is your opportunity. This is your moment to shine. I've got your back. Have fun with it. Break a leg."", Josh reached for her hand and kissed her on the cheek.  
  
  A professionally dressed middle-aged woman popped out of the auditorium. ""Annabelle, they're ready for you now.""  
  
Epilogue.  
  
Nine years later.  
  
  The warmup group was just finishing up. Backstage was its usual controlled panic and bedlam. Behind the curtain, Annabelle stepped serenely center stage, sipping from a bottle of Springwater. The set had been maneuvered, and her backup was getting into position. Annabelle's stage manager approached her, smiled, winked at her, took her bottle, and exited the stage right.  
  
  Josh strode in from stage right. Despite having been a civilian for four years, he was still extremely thin, tanned, and his hair was still high and tight. "" How are you doing, Honey? I just checked with the au pair, the boys are doing fine. Your sisters are doing great. Celise says she just loves the seats. You know, it's a pity your mom couldn't have been here to see this.""  
  
  ""This is the biggest venue I've played, it's a bit intimidating.""  
  
  ""Piece of cake. You're tough. You've handled worse. This is what you've worked for. This is your stage, your destiny. Stay loose and enjoy it. When I was sniping for the Corps, I never lost a protectee while on overwatch. I never will lose a protectee. I've got your back. Have fun. Break a leg.""  
  
  Annie's backup started her signature song. The audience began to murmur and shout. Josh smiled, kissed her, hugged her, and quickly exited stage left just as the curtain started to open. The applause was the loudest Annabelle had ever heard",1,1746728098.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

Working professional, no alcohol, no drugs, I prefer to host but can travel. Open to meeting in a public place or grabbing a coffee first if that adds comfort. For a first meet, I figure we can keep it pretty low pressure - maybe just pick a show to binge or movie to watch together. Feel free to reach out even if this becomes an older post.
