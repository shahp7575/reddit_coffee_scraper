1h0zegr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1h0zegr/pediatrician_told_us_to_get_visits_and_go_out_and/,Pediatrician told us to get visits and go out and I’m tempted to listen,"So, baby is home for 11 days after 32 days in NICU (born at 32w4d) and we are still processing that but are very happy that the nightmare is over. 

We went for the first appointment after discharge and the pediatrician encouraged us to leave the house, go for walks, go out to eat at open spaces without crowds and receive as many visits as we want, just to make sure that nobody has flu symptoms and to request them to use a mask and wash hands if they want to hold the baby, otherwise just keep the house well ventilated during the visit.

I’m feeling really tempted to do exactly all of that simply because it would do wonders for our mental health. My husband and I are very social people and have many friends and family that we are missing. Before birth I had to be in a moderate bed rest, so I didn’t really go out for walks since August and I really miss going out even if it’s just to walk around and get a coffee in the neighborhood. 

We moved recently so we are very excited about having people over in the new place and I really miss just spending an afternoon talking and having a nice time with friends.

The thing is: we read so much scary stuff in social media about absolutely not having visitors for the first few months of the baby, about scary diseases and avoiding all contact before vaccines. Our LO is technically a month and a half, but the fact that she’s a premmie worries me that we should be even more cautious, despite the fact that she is healthy and thriving after coming home.

Does anyone had visitors early on? Got out for walking/eating? Need reassurance that everything will be okay so that we can finally enjoy this moment, after having a really rough start.",2,1732694653.0,NewParents,3,1.0,False

I'm 34. The generation above us bought houses for what I spent on my last car. They tell stories of lowballing sellers in the 80s, the memory of their good fortune. Meanwhile, I'm staring at median house prices that are 13x annual wages, wondering if I'll ever stop being a tumbleweed.

I'm grieving for belonging. Every rental another temporary perch, another community I invest in until the winds change. Rent will rise. Owner will sell. Time to fly again.

Sometimes it feels like grieving a hundred small deaths. The death of security. Of permanence (Buddha enters the chat)

We're not just locked out of houses - we're locked out of putting down roots, of building something lasting, of ever truly landing.",18,1732694371.0,newzealand,4,0.95,False

I asked CNIB, however they are only doing zoom meetings and they don't necessarily sound like support groups (the type i am thinking of) so I was hoping to find something else. 

If not, what would the interest be in a support group in person, one where we can all just drink some coffee, chat, bounce ideas off of each other etc.... ",1,1732694035.0,RetinitisPigmentosa,0,1.0,False

Every Tuesday for the past 20 years unfolded like clockwork: waking at 4 a.m., meticulously preparing breakfast, and following the same route to his maintenance job at a local office complex. But beneath this facade of normalcy lay a chilling secret—Ryan’s routine had taken a sinister turn.

It began innocuously—a misstep, a moment of panic during his commute years ago. A pedestrian had stepped into his path, and in his disoriented state, Ryan had reacted mechanically, hiding the body and returning to his routine as though nothing had happened. The incident became a ritual, a horrifying echo in his carefully curated life. Each week, the act repeated itself, blurring the lines between his need for order and a growing detachment from reality.

**Jessica**, 25, was caught in the tumult of a love that had frayed at the edges. Her on-again, off-again relationship with Ethan had left her adrift, clinging to the hope that their bond could somehow be salvaged. Though they had broken up again, Ethan remained in her life, his presence a painful reminder of what once was. Jessica oscillated between despair and longing, haunted by the dream of a future where they were happy, married, and whole.

On a crisp autumn Tuesday, Ryan’s and Jessica’s paths crossed. Ryan had deviated from his usual pattern, inexplicably drawn to the town skatepark—a vibrant haven for restless youth, its colorful graffiti a stark contrast to his monotonous world. Jessica, nursing a coffee and her tangled thoughts, sat on a bench nearby, replaying her last conversation with Ethan. Ryan’s presence caught her attention. There was something unsettling about his stillness, his eyes scanning the scene without truly engaging. “You alright?” she asked hesitantly, her voice breaking the spell of his detachment. Ryan blinked, his voice flat but honest. “I’m... between routines.” Jessica tilted her head. “Between routines? That’s a new one. What do you mean?” He hesitated, then replied, “Tuesdays are always the same. But today, something feels... different.”

The weight of his words piqued her curiosity. “Why do you need them to be the same?”“Because it’s safe,” Ryan admitted, his tone devoid of emotion yet heavy with meaning. “If things stay the same, nothing unexpected happens. I don’t have to feel... anything.” Jessica’s gaze softened. She recognized the defense mechanism, albeit in a different form. “I get that,” she said quietly. “I guess I’ve been holding onto something for the same reason. My boyfriend—ex-boyfriend—I keep going back to him because it feels safer than letting go.”

Ryan studied her, the first flicker of understanding crossing his face. “But if it’s safe... why does it hurt?” The question lingered between them, heavy and raw. For the first time in years, Ryan allowed himself to confront the dissonance in his life—the horror buried beneath his routines, the cold emptiness that safety couldn’t fill. Jessica, too, found herself exposed. Her attachment to Ethan wasn’t about love anymore but fear—fear of being alone, of losing the version of herself she had built around him. “Maybe we’re both stuck in circles,” Ryan said, his voice steady but strained. “Mine keeps me from changing. Yours keeps you from leaving.” Jessica nodded, tears pooling in her eyes. “But how do we break them?” Ryan looked at the skatepark, alive with motion and noise, its chaos oddly beautiful. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “But maybe... maybe we try something different. Even if it’s uncomfortable.” Jessica followed his gaze, a spark of determination igniting in her chest. “Maybe,” she echoed As the evening deepened, the two sat in silence, their shared understanding forging a fragile connection. The cycles that had defined their lives suddenly felt less inevitable, their grip loosening in the presence of someone who truly saw them. Ryan didn’t know if he could abandon his routines entirely. Jessica wasn’t sure if she could let go of Ethan. But in the stillness of that Tuesday, they took a small but monumental step toward change—acknowledging the darkness within and daring to envision a way out. In the circles they had drawn around themselves, cracks began to form, letting in the faintest glimmer of light. And in that fragile, fleeting moment, both Ryan and Jessica found a reason to hope.",1,1732693959.0,horrorEncounters28,0,1.0,False

1h0z7hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h0z7hh/i_19m_like_my_sisters_friend_28f_but_i_dont_know/,"I (19M) like my sister’s friend (28F), but I don’t know if she feels the same. How would you interpret this situation?","TLDR; I (19M) like my sister’s friend (28F) and have no clue if she reciprocates the feelings. She stayed with us for a week and during that time she showed signs of potential interest through compliments, personal conversations, playful teasing, and subtle physical touches. I am still unsure whether she likes me back or not.

Okay some backstory, the woman I like is 28F (let’s call her N) and I am 19M (turning 20 soon). N lives in a different state, but used to live in my state and has been friends with my sister for awhile. Well, N came to visit for a week and stayed with us (I live with my sister and brother-in-law). 

* One night when we were going out to hang out as a group, plus a friend of mine, and meeting others. She had already been reading a book but it was a little big to carry around I guess, so she asked me if I had a book that could fit in her back pocket. Then she proceeded to turn around and show me her backside. Which her book did actually fit in there. When I gave her the book, she ended up carrying it in her purse instead. 
* We went out shopping as a group. She and I were talking and randomly she goes, “You have pretty eyes.” Which everybody compliments me about, so it’s not that out of the ordinary. But my sister and I have the same eyes and since she’s friends with my sister, it’s weird that she’s never complimented my sister’s. Which my sister got mad because she was like, “We have the same eyes. But everyone compliments his.”
* My sister gave our waiter N’s number, but N was very against it. The whole time after leaving the restaurant, she was worried about what to say if he texts her. Since she doesn’t live here. And she’s always worried about inconveniencing other people. Well, he texted her and she told everyone but didn’t know what to say back. I made a joke about what she should say back which she thought was funny but said, “He probably wouldn’t understand the joke or would think it’s rude.” To which I replied, “If he doesn’t like your humor than he isn’t for you.” My brother-in-law said a joke response that I can’t remember, but N didn’t think it was too funny. One of my sister’s friends who both N and I absolutely cannot stand said, “Just say you weren’t expecting him to actually text you.” Which N was like, “No, that’s a turn off. You have to act confident.” Anyways, she wasn’t taking anyone's suggestions. Then eventually someone brought it up later, which she said, “I shut it down right away, saying I don’t live here.” Then later she and I were talking and said that it probably wouldn’t work out for them because he said he was studying for his master’s so he was probably too young for her. Then went on to explain how she went on a date with a 21 year old one time and felt like his mom, because she paid for everything and was basically helping him make life decisions. Which I stated, actual age and mental age aren’t aligned, it is different amongst many people. To which she replied, “That is true, you act a lot older than you are.”
* We were in a vehicle waiting for my brother-in-law to finish up doing his job and she was laying down then I was getting into the vehicle so she sat up. Then eventually laid down again and asked, “Am I invading your personal space?” Proceeds to lay her head right next to my leg and her hair was on my leg. 
* One of my cats likes it when you pet him aggressively. So she was petting him and said something like, “He likes it rough. He likes to basically be beat up when you pet him.” And sometimes, I’m a dirty minded person, so I just start laughing for a little bit and she asked me why I was laughing and I go, “Like father like son.” Then that led to a conversation about sadists and masochists. And a little bit about what we like in sex. 
* There were other conversations of sex and what we like. Although, I feel like she talked more about it than I did. 
* We were bonding over books. I’ve recently been interested in collecting vintage books and going to book stores and vintage stores. Well one night we were up talking and she had plans to go get coffee with a friend in the morning and she told me that she was going to a book store after around 10:30 am and asked if I wanted to go. (I’m not really a morning person) so I was like, “HA. That’s funny. That’s too early.” Which she replied, that it wasn’t early. So I said, I’d put an alarm on and if I woke up then I’d go with her, if I didn’t wake up, then that’s her answer. Then later my sister and brother-in-law came downstairs to hang out with us and they asked what her plans were for the day. Which she told them and when she mentioned the bookstore, my sister realized she forgot that they planned to go there that day. Then they said, “Okay, we will go with you tomorrow.” Which she replied, “No, it’s okay. You guys don’t have to go.” And was very adamant on saying they don’t have to join. (So I’m wondering if she meant it as a day to spend together alone or she just felt like she was inconveniencing them.)
* One day we went shopping and I drove separately because I did not want to go out to breakfast with them, so I met them later. When we went our separate ways to our vehicles, she had eye contact that was a little longer than normal. (I could be delusional). 
* She separated from my sister and brother-in-law in a store and walked with me. Proceeds to pick up books and read them (they were weird and funny books). Was giggling and just reading them outloud to me, I think to make a conversation. At the same store, she saw a suction massager and said “I think I just saw a vibrator.” Then I went up to it to inspect it and was like “Um, no, it’s a massager.” Then she proceeds to talk about how it could be used as a vibrator.
* One night we were playing a board game with my sister, brother-in-law, N, and me. One of my cats went under the coffee table so I reached to pet him and she did also and we touched hands. But both continued petting the cat and continued to touch hands. She is the type of person to accidentally touch you or be in your space and apologize for it. 
* The last night she was here, we went over to my grandma’s place. One topic that was brought up was when one day I said that I can only stand her out of all of my sister’s friends. So she relayed this to my family and said, “He only said stand. He never said liked.” So I’m wondering if she can’t tell I like her?
* A few times when she texts me back, she has taken a little while to type back, like she is thinking hard about how to reply. And the messages come off as flirtatious (I think). \[I can post what the messages say, for others to interpret if needed.\]

I just want to know if I’m delusional or if I’m not crazy and she likes me back.",2,1732693825.0,Advice,3,0.75,False

* A few times when she texts me back, she has taken a little while to type back, like she is thinking hard about how to reply. And the messages come off as flirtatious (I think). \[I can post what the messages say, for others to interpret if needed.\]

Yesterday she decided she wanted chicken soup to make her feel better. She told me to defrost the chicken and I did. I then went out to work and she sent me an angry message saying why didn't I tell her we had no orzo as I was the last one to use it up several weeks ago. I said I didn't realise it was a staple we always need in the house, in my mind orzo is a specific ingredient you buy when you have a recipe in mind. She then had to wait several hours for me to return from work and collect the orzo on my way home. When I return home the soup had been out in the kitchen for 10 hours. She added the orzo to the soup but then realised that the chicken hadn't properly cooked and she had to throw the whole thing away. She started shouting at me that none of this would've happened if I hadn't poisoned her and if I had put orzo on the shopping list. She then said she was going to have toast for dinner. I said are you ready to have dinner now and she said yes because she was waiting for me. I said OK let's eat. She said to give her a few minutes because she wasn't hungry. I waited half an hour and said if she was eating and she git mad at me saying why do I always have to wait for her for everything, if I'm hungry just eat. She said she's fed up with my codependent behaviour and need to do everything together. She then starts crying and when she realises the bread is frozen and stuck together she throws the freezer drawer on the floor, causing it to split in two. She then started crying and she didn't want to talk and wanted to be alone the rest of the evening. 

I haven't apologised for upsetting her because I am angry at her reaction but now we're in a stalemate where nobody will break the silence or apologise to the other because we both think the other is in the wrong ",2,1732693608.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

first of all, i want to say that i love my sister dearly. i'm 18 and she's 16, of course we used to fight a lot when we were younger, and now we're really close. i also have an older brother, he's 21.

me and my sister have always been different from each other. i'm shy, introvert, anxious, and spend most of the time alone; she's the total opposite, extrovert, loud, protective, etc. we're black and white. baggy pants and skinny jeans. winter and summer. dark and light. simple and luxurious.
her biggest problem though is that she seems to not know when and/or how to behave or shut her mouth.
she jokes a lot, with us and her friends, but sometimes she takes it too far, like joking about my brother's hygiene or hobbies, my romantic relationships and/or trauma. 
i joke a lot about my traumas myself, but again, sometimes she takes it too far. 
she seems polite and calm in front of strangers or other members of the family, but i swear she totally changes when she's home. 
she's screaming at least 3h a day for an online game, insulting people, punching the table or the nearest surface she can throw her phone on— and we mustn't DARE to complain or tell her to be quiet— she'll start yelling at us like it's our fault if she lost the game, and she argues with our stepfather a LOT because of that.
if she wants something, she must have it, doesn't matter how. makeup, skincare products, hair products (even the ones she can live without), clothes, dresses, shoes, restaurants, anything – anything. sephora perfumes, douglas/dior/ysl/kiko makeup and skincare serums, pantene hair masks, victoria's secret lingerie, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants in Florence. 
i have nothing against her lifestyle, i do use her stuff if i really have to, but the problem is that we can't always afford all those things (and that's why she acts cute and give our dad puppy eyes), and when we can't, she tries to insist. 
or when I can afford and/or buy something for MYSELF, then she must have something too.
two days ago i got my physical revolut cart, and she started complaining, saying that she wanted her own card too. 
i buy something for myself from shein or aliexpress? then i must buy something for her too.
me and my brother order food when she isn't home? we must order something for her too!! (but she doesn't do the same when she goes shopping with our grandma).
she makes fun of me because my boyfriend is younger, and i can see where she comes from, but when she was his age she dated a 20yo. when I was his age i dated a 18yo. so why can she date older people, but he ""can't""? [he's over the age of consent (idk how to call it srry)].
she makes fun of him too, even though they never even talked, just because of stereotypes. i know that she's just kidding, but it does hurt my feelings, because i care so much about him and i can't stand hearing her make fun of him like that.
idk, i hope you understand what type of person she is.
many times she took things too far.
ex. my brother once told her that she had a pimple in her face– and she started to roast him, talking about his hair, skin, teeth, eyebrows– any ""imperfection"", and it broke my heart, because even though my brother is very sarcastic, he's also very sensitive:( and i know it because he vented to me many times, and i know how he really feels.
she often jokes about my insecurities too, my nose, teeth, anything. again, i know that she's joking, but she also knows what i'm insecure about. but she doesn't seem to care— and she's untouchable, because she's the youngest sister, because she's the loudest and the last person you want to argue with.
but enough of that, let's just skip to today.
it's currently 8am. i couldn't sleep all night and, around 6:30am, i started to hear my mom screaming at my sister to get up and go to school, but she didn't want to, she was tired, because she made her best friend come over at midnight and went to bed at 2am.
it was horrible :( i heard my mom screaming and my sister screaming back at her, heavy footsteps, doors slamming, my mom's voice breaking. someone would have thought there was going on some sort of abuse. i got up to make coffee, and my sister had locked herself in the bathroom, and my mom was on the phone with my grandma (who had to come pick up my sister and drop her off at the train station), so i went to the door and knocked, and asked my sister if i could come in. i heard her cry, felt the disappointment in my mother's voice, i had to take deep breaths to not breakdown. eventually we gave up and left her alone for a few minutes, it was like 6:45am. i made coffee, cried a bit, kept my mom some company until my sister got out of the bathroom, ready for school. when she left the house, my mom looked at me and said, ""see? am i the evil one here?"", and i felt my heart drop:( i hate that my sister does this to our mom, i know that she's a teenager and everyone is different, but for fuck's sake, can't you let your mother start a day nicely?? my mother is drained, my stepfather gave up, my brother can't stand her, and i hate to see this side of the family;
""you should talk to her about it"", we can't, she'd think that we're all against her and don't understand her. we tried therapy, but our psychologist started telling us to pray, so we dropped her and i doubt that my sister would agree to see another one. i don't know what to do, i can't wait to move out, but i don't want to leave my mother and brother alone in this... maybe i'm sensitive, maybe i'm dramatic or exaggerating, but it still hurts me so much.
there are many other things i could talk about, but i don't want to make this post any longer.

i'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, english isn't my first language! + i'm not asking for advice, i just needed to vent, it was a terrible way to start the day.",4,1732693172.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I have been using the Matein backpack for 5 years, literally every single day. This includes biking to and from work, traveling to different states, walking about 2 miles a day on average in different weather conditions.

It has served me well. Its still going strong except for the wear and tear.

I am considering a slight upgrade now mostly for storage. I am looking at Aer Travel Pack 3, 35 liters.

I was wondering if it can be used in a similar way? I am average height and usually will be carrying:
2 laptops (work + personal), ipad, kindle, notebook, Vr headset and the other misc items like chargers and glasses.

And when traveling, i would wanna pack for atleast a weekend trip and preferably a week long trip with stuff like clothes, toiletries, hairdryer (at which point one can argue that you can live it indefinitely)

The matein bag currently can do a weekend with some effort (minus the vr headset and hairdryer)

So the questions are:

- Is the aer travel pack 3 good for my use? 

- Will 35 ltr look weird or too big if i use it for everything? (Walk to the coffee shop on a Saturday with a laptop and then fly for a week to another state on Sunday)

- Can the 35 ltr be used as a personal item on frontier and spirit if not fully packed on those short trips?

- Better alternatives?

- if the $20 amazon bag lasted me this long, why should I consider the $200+ option instead of getting another larger one from amazon?

TLDR:

Amazon $20 backpack lasted me 5 years of rough use, should I now get an aer travel pack 3 or get another amazon backpack with more storage from Matein? 
What do premium bags offer more (besides the quality of materials) that can justify them?

Is 35 ltr good for everyday + travel and will it be fine on those frontier flights for small not fully loaded trips?

Whether you’re searching for [pendant lights in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) to enhance your interiors or looking for design tips, this guide will help you choose the perfect hanging lights for every space in your home.

# 1. Entryway: Setting the Tone

The entryway is your home's first impression. A bold pendant light here can create a welcoming atmosphere. Choose a design that complements your overall décor theme—whether it’s a sleek modern fixture or a charming bohemian piece. For high ceilings, consider multi-tiered hanging lights to fill the vertical space.

# 2. Living Room: Style Meets Function

In the living room, pendant lights serve as both a focal point and a source of ambiance. [Hanging lights for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) spaces should balance beauty and functionality. A cluster of pendants above the coffee table or a single oversized light above the seating area can create a warm, inviting vibe. Pair them with complementary [floor lamps in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/milia-floor-lamp-black) to layer your lighting for a cohesive and stylish look.

# 3. Dining Room: Focal Points Above the Table

The dining room is where pendant lights truly shine. Center your fixture above the dining table to create a dramatic effect. Opt for dimmable lights to set the mood for everything from intimate dinners to lively family gatherings. Popular designs in Dubai include contemporary metal finishes and handwoven textures, adding character to your dining space.

# 4. Kitchen: Task Lighting with Style

In the kitchen, pendant lights are essential for both aesthetics and practicality. Install them above the island or countertops to illuminate work areas. Industrial-style pendants or glass shades are popular options for kitchens in Dubai, offering a chic yet functional vibe.

# 5. Bedroom: Subtle Sophistication

Pendant lights in the bedroom add an unexpected touch of elegance. Use them as bedside lighting instead of traditional table lamps for a modern look. Select warm, diffused lighting to create a relaxing environment conducive to rest.

# 6. Bathroom: Bright and Functional

Bathrooms can also benefit from well-placed pendant lights. Hang them above the vanity for task lighting that enhances functionality while adding a decorative touch. Make sure to choose moisture-resistant designs for safety.

# 7. Outdoor Areas: Extend the Style

Pendant lights aren’t just for indoor spaces. Use them in outdoor patios or balconies to create a cozy, stylish ambiance. Look for weatherproof options that can withstand Dubai’s climate while providing soft lighting for evening gatherings.

No advice needed thanks,"Just to flag with others how this company has changed policy! I have used Amazon for years. Occasionally an item goes missing for whatever reason, they have always replaced it, no problems and customer service people were polite and helpful.

Recently we ordered a coffee machine from them. The item was photographed delivered outside our building on the streets (they have never delivered here before). We were down within 10 minutes, package gone. I suspect the driver honestly, given the time frame but I also understand that there are opportunists. 

Amazon are refusing to take responsibility for this completely reckless delivery method. They insist they have no responsibility to deliver the package securely and we must deal with the police to get this resolved.

They don't want to replace the item or refund the money. As you can imagine, we are fuming because this is not an acceptable way of delivering things, leaving them on the streets when there is a perfectly suitable reception area downstairs.

What's worse is they are completely unempathetic, just apologising meaninglessly while telling us that they are not responsible for this. They just copy paste scripted responses. How is this the world we use now. Customer service may as well be replaced by ai bots, if they haven't already. No more online shopping for me! 

I have opted to stop using them for any purchase of significant value going forward. Just wanted to make people aware of this. We did nothing wrong, couldn't really have done anything better and they are in my assessment responsible for ridiculous delivery methods of a £300 item. Happened in Wales.

She told one of her friend that she likes me too but she never told me this at all.

Another thing that is red flag is, rebounding as she broke up with her ex like in october and they dated for 3 months so im scared that she only likes me becuz of trying to rebound.

I've been trying to be nicer and gentler instead of a ball of stress 24/7.  I work at home, often putting in 60hr+ weeks, and I tend to neglect the rest of the household including my partner when I get sidelined too much, and that includes our shared passions.  I don't want it to be that way, but that's how high-pressure my job is.  Seeing that it's a holiday week and there's finally light at the end of the tunnel after more than 6 weeks of grinding like crazy, I woke up in a GREAT mood.  I got it thrown back in my face in this ridiculously mocking tone like, ""HAAAYYYYYY,"" he winced away from me when I tried to kiss him hello, and then when he came back outside with his coffee he proceeded to explain that he didn't like my ""baby voice""... WHAT??

Then he says to me that he feels like we have nothing in common anymore, that he's not interested in anything I do anymore, that I don't seem to be interested in what he likes anymore... I'm sitting here completely dumbfounded feeling like this is all out of left field, and I called him out on it, and told him that's completely untrue, seeing as how we just had a date night 3 days ago and had a MARVELOUS conversation.  It felt like we could just breathe and be ourselves for the first time in a long time.

So, after this strange outburst, I shut down and passed it off as ""this is my customer service voice and I guess I can't shut it off"".  He called it my ""Britney Spears"" voice.  I guess I didn't even realize I was doing that... according to him, I've been doing it for a year.

When I tell you I questioned EVERY. Word. That came. Out. Of my mouth. Today. on the phone with clients... I really felt gaslit and now I just hope I didn't sound totally awkward.  It felt like I was constantly pulling the Elizabeth Holmes ""low voice"" thing.

So now... I'm just CONFUSED and feel like damned if I do, damned if I don't. I can't be stressed, I can't be upset, I can't vent, and now apparently I can't be happy.

Husbands... WHAT THE EVER LIVING HELL IS THIS?

Wives... have you ever been told this?

I can't even begin to describe how depressed and upset I've been about this today.  It has officially taken up 12 hours of my thoughts.

I went out to try spending time with him again tonight, and when he said ""heeeyyyy!""  I gave it right back to him the same way he did me this morning.

I know it was petty, but I think he got the point.

While it may sound like a simple concept, the importance of understanding how trading desks work can have a significant impact on the decisions you make as a trader. At **Beirman Capital**, we believe that making informed decisions is essential to your success in trading. In this blog, we’ll explain what a trading desk is, the different types of trading desks, and why it matters when choosing your broker. We’ll also explain how Beirman Capital’s platform leverages advanced trading desk technology to help you optimize your trading experience.

# What is a Trading Desk?

A **trading desk** (or **dealing desk**) is a division within a financial institution where the buying and selling of assets like stocks, bonds, forex, commodities, and more take place. This term is commonly used in various financial markets, including forex, equities, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and futures. In essence, a trading desk is where transactions are executed, and liquidity is managed.

In large financial institutions, a trading **floor** may contain multiple desks, each dedicated to a specific type of asset or financial product. These desks are responsible for ensuring liquidity, executing trades, and sometimes providing a market-making service. A trading desk may also manage client orders and charge commissions for executing trades.

At **Beirman Capital**, we utilize a robust trading desk infrastructure to ensure that our clients receive optimal liquidity, transparent pricing, and fast execution speeds.

# Types of Trading Desks

Understanding the different types of trading desks is essential for any trader, as it can influence which platform best suits your needs. Let’s take a closer look at the various types of trading desks:

1. **Forex Trading Desks** Forex trading desks handle currency pairs such as USD/EUR, GBP/JPY, and others. These desks often act as **market makers**, providing liquidity to the forex market and ensuring that traders have access to competitive bid and ask prices. At **Beirman Capital**, we offer access to reliable forex trading desks that ensure liquidity and transparency, helping you execute your trades effectively.
2. **Fixed Income Trading Desks** Fixed income desks deal with assets like **government bonds**, **corporate bonds**, and other debt securities. These desks aim to provide a stable income stream to investors, making them crucial for those looking to diversify their portfolios. At Beirman Capital, our fixed income desks give traders access to high-quality debt instruments with competitive pricing.
3. **Commodity Trading Desks** Commodity trading desks focus on products like **gold**, **silver**, **oil**, and agricultural commodities like **coffee** and **wheat**. These desks provide liquidity in commodity markets, which can be especially volatile. Beirman Capital’s commodity trading desks offer traders a secure environment to trade physical and futures contracts with competitive spreads.
4. **Equity Trading Desks** Equity trading desks manage stock trades, whether for **individual stocks** or broader equity indices. These desks are essential for executing large volumes of equity transactions. Beirman Capital’s equity trading desks allow traders to buy and sell stocks quickly, benefiting from low spreads and high liquidity.
5. **Derivative Trading Desks** Derivatives desks deal with financial products like **futures**, **options**, and **swaps**. These desks help traders hedge their portfolios, speculate on price movements, or leverage their positions. At Beirman Capital, we provide access to state-of-the-art derivative trading desks, allowing you to trade these instruments with the best execution standards.

# Why Trading Desks Matter for Traders

Now that we’ve discussed the types of trading desks, let’s explore why they are essential for traders and why you should consider how they influence your choice of trading platform.

# 1. Helps in Broker Selection

When choosing a trading broker, you’ll encounter two primary types: brokers with dealing desks and brokers without. Understanding these options can make a significant difference in your trading experience.

* **Brokers with Dealing Desks**: These brokers act as market makers and provide liquidity to traders by managing the bid and ask prices. They often offer **fixed spreads** and charge no commission. These brokers are ideal for beginners or traders who prefer a more structured trading environment.
* **Brokers without Dealing Desks**: These brokers serve as intermediaries between the trader and the market, providing access to real-time market prices with **variable spreads**. This type of broker is preferred by advanced traders who need faster execution and more control over their trades.

At **Beirman Capital**, we offer both options, allowing you to choose the type of trading environment that best aligns with your trading strategy. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned trader, we have the tools and platforms to support your needs.

# 2. Cost-Effective Trading

One of the main advantages of brokers with trading desks is the ability to offer **low-cost trading** through **fixed spreads**. This can be especially beneficial for traders who want to avoid additional fees or commissions and prefer a more predictable cost structure. With fixed spreads, you can plan your trades more effectively.

At **Beirman Capital**, we provide competitive pricing with fixed spreads on our trading desk platforms, making it easier for you to manage your costs while executing trades seamlessly.

# 3. Account Management and Support

Brokers with trading desks often provide more personalized **account management** services. These brokers can help manage your account, assist in trade execution, and offer insights into market conditions. They can also provide you with training, **educational resources**, and **professional support**, which is especially useful for beginner traders.

At **Beirman Capital**, we pride ourselves on providing world-class customer support and educational resources. Our team is always ready to help you with trade placement, platform usage, and strategies to improve your trading success.

# 4. Security and Reliability

Reputable brokers with trading desks are typically licensed and regulated by top-tier financial authorities, offering a higher level of **security** for your trades. They adhere to strict regulations, ensuring a secure environment for traders to execute their strategies.

**Beirman Capital** is fully regulated, providing you with the peace of mind that comes with trading on a secure and trustworthy platform. We prioritize the safety of your funds and data and comply with industry-leading regulations to protect your interests.

# Limitations of Trading Desks

While trading desks offer many advantages, there are also potential limitations to consider.

# 1. Conflict of Interest

One of the primary concerns with brokers who operate trading desks is the possibility of a **conflict of interest**. Because these brokers often act as the counterparty to the trade, they may profit from a trader’s loss. This can lead to a lack of transparency in pricing and market manipulation.

At **Beirman Capital**, we prioritize transparency and fair pricing, ensuring that our clients are always aware of the true cost of their trades.

# 2. Limited Control

Brokers with trading desks have more control over trade executions, which can limit the flexibility of traders. **Non-dealing desk brokers**, on the other hand, allow traders direct access to market prices, offering greater control and flexibility in trade execution.

At **Beirman Capital**, we offer both dealing desk and non-dealing desk options, allowing you to choose the level of control and transparency you need.

# 3. Order Execution Delays

Because brokers with trading desks manage orders internally, there may be delays in **order execution**. In contrast, brokers without dealing desks provide direct access to the market, resulting in faster trade execution.

Beirman Capital ensures **quick order execution** with minimal delays, regardless of whether you choose our dealing desk or non-dealing desk platform.

# Conclusion

Trading desks play a critical role in the financial markets, offering both benefits and potential drawbacks depending on your needs as a trader. For beginners, brokers with trading desks offer valuable support and low-cost trading. For advanced traders, brokers without trading desks provide direct access to market pricing and greater flexibility.

At **Beirman Capital**, we understand that different traders have different needs, which is why we provide a range of trading desk options tailored to your goals. Whether you prefer fixed spreads, low-cost trading, or direct market access, Beirman Capital is the ideal platform to help you achieve your trading objectives.

I’m feeling stuck, betrayed and unheard? ","My husband and I “F31” have been together for 15 years. It’s been rocky recently. So backstory on the ex. So about 5 years into our relationship we took a “break” but one of those basically your together in every way without the labels. It was my husband’s idea for it at the time we were boyfriend/girlfriend. We were young and he said he wanted to concentrate on his work and studies so we took a break. We were still together a lot. I ended up finding out later that he had a girlfriend. I was completely shocked because we were together a lot and everything between us was normal except for that fact that we were on a break. Because of that I wasn’t seeing anyone else I was still completely loyal to him. Like I thought he was to me. 


Fast forward to the future and us later getting back together, (the relationship with his ex was only probably a couple weeks long. ) we later end up getting married a few years later have kids. Until recently this past year he’s been talking to her again here and there. He’s always had her on socials on and off through out all the years. Sometimes would take her off then years later she would be back on again. He never talked to her so I didn’t fight too much about it although it made me uncomfortable. What he did do that bothered me was take screenshots of pictures of her or send heart eye reactions it was those physical gestures of letting her know that he was liking what he was seeing that bothered me. 

I told him I didn’t like it and it made me feel uncomfortable and he said to stop being insecure or don’t look at his stuff and for me to mind my business and stop causing problems. When I would bring it up I wouldn’t use attacking statements or berate him about it. I would just calmly say how it made me feel.  

Well it progressed because then he started to talk to her on there. It shocked me what I saw. Our relationship was doing really well when all this happened so I really felt blindsided by this. We would always have such deep talks and just laugh together when the kids would go to bed, I always do little things to show I care or that I appreciate him, learn and make meals I know he would like and such. 

So when I saw that he was talking to her and saying the things he said it really hurt me. He told her that he was miserable with me and that he’s been miserable for years and wants a divorce. That I do nothing all day and that I don’t have a job, and that I don’t appreciate him. I don’t have a normal job yes. Because I with our toddler all day and finding a job that works around my husband schedule is hard bc he gets off at odd hours each day. He knows how hard I’ve been looking and he sees me apply to countless jobs and seen me many interviews getting excited, bc of how I know we really need this and I want to help him.

I clean, I cook, sometimes he cooks too. So I don’t know where he gets that I do nothing all day. It’s not even possible with an active toddler to sit and do nothing. I do things to show him I appreciate him, I tell him daily. I message him every morning telling him to have a great shift and that I’m grateful for all he does, I have his clothes laid out, so when he gets home, he can get a fresh shower, I give him massages randomly throughout the week. I cook meals with him in mind of what I think he would want. 


I don’t know why he would go to her and say he’s miserable and wants to divorce and say those things about me. Why does he want her to know those things? I asked him why he would tell her that. His response was it was the truth should have I lied to her? I just feel if these are feelings he’s having I should have been the one to know about it and not him going to his ex saying that, bc to me it seems to be another motive as to why he felt she needed to know that. Why not tell me so we can fix it or talk with a therapist why go to another woman? It’s hard for me to understand bc if I’m not happy I’m not going and telling a guy happy I am. If anything I could see telling a best friend but not an ex. 

We somehow get past this after a week he says he’s sorry and that he was just searching for validation from another woman and that he liked the attention it got him. 

Again I thought we were past this he stopped talking to her he stopped screenshotting pictures of her (he was doing this daily prior)  things were getting better so I thought, he was sending me more romantic videos and he even planned a romantic date for us this weekend that I was so excited and looking forward to. I was looking at some stuff our daughter needed on my phone along with a dress I wanted to wear for our date since he said we were going somewhere formal. He again out of no where said do you want me to confess something? I was curious and said yes wondering what it could possibly be. He said that he was talking to her again, and that they met up the day prior for coffee ( he’s already at this point had 6 beers so idk if he was making up that they met up) he was talking to her bc he showed me. 

He said that he can’t give her up and that she’s his friend and there’s nothing I can do about it.  He said that she’s a player like him and he likes that.  He said she’s a very cool girl and they have had some deep conversations that he’s never had with any other girl including me in all our years being together. He told me that he loved her and that if I should be worried about any girl it should be her, because all she has to do is tell him she wants him, and immediately he would leave to her.  He said that she cooks really good and she could give me some pointers. Again saying that she’s his friend but he would leave me for her. I couldn’t believe this. He messaged her saying that he told his friends that she was his dream girl and the only definition of a woman in his eyes.  The whole time he was saying this he felt so proud and kind of had a smile when he was saying this, watching the sadness come over my face along with shock. Because I truly felt blindsided. Then hour later he’s trying to say sorry and say that I’m upset for nothing and I’m being silly and mad for no reason. 

At this point I’m crying silently tears are just pouring out I can’t control it I have a knot in my throat I just feel so stupid and played and betrayed and just every emotion trying to figure what I did wrong, what did I do to deserve this. All I have are my kids, but I have nothing, no career no back up plan. I should have more at my age. He’s sleeping right now he has work in the morning and just like always he will use he was drunk and stupid as the excuse. But he can’t keep damaging our relationship and my peace every time he drinks. It’s not fair. I want a husband that will love me more than matter who he converses with. Someone he’s proud of. I feel that it’s not healthy or normal for a husband or a person to treat someone like this. Get drunk and tell another girl you’re into them and not your wife? That line should never be crossed? He’s not going to fix the damage he’s not going to go to her and say he was drunk and stupid and that he’s actually got a good women by his side, bc that’s not the attention he’s seeking, that wouldn’t give him the validation he’s looking for. 

It’s late I’m rambling now. I feel alone and have no one to talk to, I also wouldn’t want to tell anyone that knows me this anyways. It’s embarrassing and shameful and as much as I know what he’s doing is wrong I wouldn’t want to talk bad about him, which probably sounds crazy. Considering he doesn’t consider me in anything he says. He says all guys are like him and anyone who says it’s not true are just lying or being lied to. He said every man would do what he’s doing right now. ",11,1732690714.0,relationship_advice,21,0.87,False
1h0ygp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1h0ygp5/need_some_financial_advice_my_wife_and_i_keep/,"Need some financial advice, my wife and I keep arguing over money!","Hi! Help! We need some different perspectives to help us navigate this marriage hurdle! 

My (f37) and my wife (f33) have two kids (2,4). We have a mortgage sitting at $650K on a house appraised at $950K, this is where we live. We have a lot of equity because we used profits of sale from my wifes first house to purchase our new one. We both work full time and our combined income is about $6000 per fortnight. 

We have two savings accounts, one has $50K and the other had $25K. This money was earned from the sale of my investment property a few years ago. Before that our joint savings dwindled to near nothing when my wife went onto half pay following the birth of our second child.

The account with $25K has dwindled down to $6K this year due to big bills, some light over spending, a whole new front fence ($10K), a thousand here and there on big ticket items, windscreen, tire blow-outs and also landscaping work we are doing.

We haven't been saving this year, partly due to my not feeling like we need to because we are so comfortable and partly well I guess we just haven't had leftovers at the end of the fortnight.

My wife's concerns are that we continue to take from the savings and not topping it up at all, that renovations and that sort of stuff are not neccesary and we should put a hold on that sort thing until we top the savings back up again to her comfortable range of $10-$15K, she doesn't consider the $50K to be savings, i'm not sure why. She is quite focused on my spending, referencing things like getting my nails and hair done or going for lunches and coffee's and compares this against her daily expenses which she says are petrol for the car to work and maybe lunch once a week but much lower than my own spending. 

I see that there's disparity there, I invest in my personal appearance though not crazily, I don't buy designer anything, I don't tan or do cosmetic surgery or crazy expensive hairdos. I'm actually quite low maintenance compared to many other women my age but her spending next to mine is like nought, she doesn't do hair or makeup or any girl stuff, wears jeans and a tshirt mostly. That's her style and it works for her, but it's not mine.

My concerns are far and few between, I spend within my salary, we don't save because we don't need to right now so live a little more fancy than others and really my only worry is that she is making me feel so ashamed of spending. Noting I also do the majority of the household grocery shopping and needs for the kids too so it probably looks like I spend more to her on myself than I really do. My comfortable savings range is the $50K, I've never had that kind of savings before we sold my investment property so it's amazing for me to have that and i'm proud of it. I don't see any issues with investing in our home, renovations, landscaping etc as long as we don't touch the $50K. And it's my plan that once the $25K is used on our home improvements that we start saving in that account again.

Her belief is that I will spend all of our money, never save and we will be in financial ruin. I'm really struggling with the wording she's using around this too because I can see just how insanely blessed we are, I know there's people who can't afford to eat, pay rent, drive their car and we are doing so so well but she's acting like we are broke and really piling it on me that I'm going to ruin us. But I just don't see it that way. At all. And I don't understand how to reassure her because nothing I say is able to get her to see reason. Ugh. Please help me reddit.

Writing and self-publishing a book can feel like cooking a five-course meal without a recipe—sure, you’ve got the ingredients, but the end result might be more of a mess than a masterpiece.

For many aspiring authors, the frustration of not knowing where to start or how to finish often leads to their ideas staying locked in their heads.

The [24 Hour Book System](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/24-hour-book-system-official) promises to unlock the blocks and give you a step-by-step recipe for turning raw ideas into a polished, publishable book.

This course, designed by Stefan James, offers a **rapid book publishing guide** with the tools and tips to help you whip up a book and serve it on Amazon’s Kindle platform in just 24 hours. Let’s see if it’s the secret sauce you’ve been looking for or just another half-baked idea.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** The 24 Hour Book System
* **Category:** Self-Publishing on Amazon
* **Overall Verdict:** 4.4/5

# Detailed Product Analysis

The **24 Hour Book System** is more than a flashy name—it’s a **comprehensive book writing system** that aims to simplify the process of self-publishing. The course is divided into **11 easy-to-follow video tutorials**, paired with **templates and worksheets** to keep you on track.

The **10-step framework** serves as the backbone, walking users through brainstorming ideas, organizing content, and publishing on Amazon Kindle. If you're skeptical about finishing a book in 24 hours, don't worry—the program is more about efficiency than impossible deadlines.

A particularly useful addition is the **book marketing strategies for Amazon** segment, which explains how to increase your book's visibility. There’s also guidance on **book formatting for Kindle**, so you don’t end up with a mess of poorly aligned pages.

That said, the **designing book covers that sell** module could use more pizzazz; it’s a bit too reliant on external tools without offering much creative direction.

Overall, this **effective self-publishing method** provides a practical approach for new authors, helping them avoid common pitfalls and get straight to publishing success.

# Personal Experience

After hearing the buzz, I decided to give the [24 Hour Book System](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/24-hour-book-system-official) a try. Armed with a cup of strong coffee and a solid idea, I managed to draft a short guidebook in less than two days.

The **quick book creation methods** kept me focused, while the templates were lifesavers in keeping my content organized. With simple marketing tips, I quickly learned how to make my book more visible to readers.

One snag? The **cover design module** didn’t feel as dynamic as the rest of the course. While it offered solid advice, I found myself wishing for a bit more creativity. Still, I walked away with a published book, which felt like an accomplishment worth celebrating.

Fathers day weekend was happening, it was Friday, and I was at the front POS of a daytime coffee book place, and night time $50+ per person dinner.  (kinda cool, kinda chic, kinda pisses the worker off)

I was the lead night time server.

I'm at the front POS, because our small room of 40 was booked all weekend, and we were at max staff, and that POS happens to look like the front of a counter... (which it is during daytime)

This guy comes up and starts chewing me out that my host couldn't seat 14 of them at a 12 top openers played Tetris with to even make work especially when the Resy was for 12.

I was also putting in a 10 tops order at the time.  My manager was 2 ft behind the yelling individual trying to find a moment to interrupt, gave up, and felt it was best to let him run out of steam.

I do not give my manager shit for this decision privately, he knew I could take it, and that I was equipped for it.  In public, I condone him every chance I get.  Like here.

I took the tirade, finished inputting my order, looked up, and gestured to the manager behind him, after the individual finished his fireworks.

Long story short... that dude probably planned his whole weekend, wife added 2 more at the last moment and took it out on me.  Probably seconds before and wasn't capable to figure out how to emotionally work with it.  But that's half our job.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be paid as well as we are.

Sucks to be me, sucks to be him more.  He has to live with situation that creates these issues.

I have to live with the fact that as soon as I clock out, I don't have to deal with his situation.

Breath this week folks... these people don't know how to go to restaurants... and they suck even more with their families in tow.

The night before thanksgiving, a combination of these two factors, it will be a shit show.  You can make some great money, but it will be a shit show, and most people will not know how to act in public.

I really liked him and one day he waved a hey at me. So the next day I confessed to him on text. I thought he might be very nonchalant but then he started to create a conversation with me. 2 hours after my confession, he randomly asked me whether I go to any coaching. He started texting me good morning daily. We talked everyday and he was the one most of the time to initiate a conversation first. Though we did not talk in school, we made intense eye contacts and whenever we did not catch each other in school he used to ask me whether I came to school that day or not. But soon, my mother read our chats and I had to tell him that. He replied with a ""bhai please clear this doubt"" I said okay. Then he did not text me but sent reels for nearly one month. Then out of fear, I didn't reply to those reels so we stopped interacting since then. 

It's been almost an year now and not to sound cheesy but I'm still in love with him. He does notice me in school a lot. One day we made such an intense eye contact. 

I know I'm sounding delusional right now but he's not like other guys. He doesn't talk to any other girls and isn't that ""sigma male"" guy either. He's a very sweet and innocent guy (doesn't understand dark jokes that much). It's very normal if he doesn't like me but because of all this, I cannot move on. I'm holding onto him and I cannot let go. He made me feel really noticed as I was traumatised because of my last relationship so he was the first guy who I had talked to after that. But it hurts that I'm not in touch with him. 

I need a guy to advice me on this. Whether he likes me or not and should I text him or not. I mean he must have liked me a little bit no? No guy texts to everyday with random convo starters like ""what do you prefer tea or coffee"" 💀

# 💪 My Personal Story of Overcoming Depression

* In 2021, I was diagnosed with depression. The reasons were complex: the pandemic, isolation, work and life pressures, and even political trauma. It took me 7 months just to recognize I had depression. I was shocked by the lack of consumer products that could inform people about their mental health conditions.
* I tried many available solutions at the time, but fewer than 50% were effective. Some so-called resources even made me feel worse.
* I had to carve my own path to recovery, developing a systematic approach:
   * 📝 How to ask for sick leave and get insurance coverage.
   * 🔍 How to identify specific pain points.
   * 🤗 How to find a supportive community.
   * 💭 How to replace negative thoughts with healthier ones.
   * 🤔 How to recognize toxic relationships and detach from them.
   * ☀️ What habits to change for long-term well-being.
* After recovering, I wanted to deepen my understanding of mental health. I left my role at Meta (as a Team Lead working on AI applications) and transitioned to TikTok, where I worked on psychological and mental health initiatives.
* Years later, after leaving the big tech world and taking a two-month sabbatical, I explored the idea of creating an AI-powered consumer app for mental support, drawing from my unique experiences:
   * 💼 Over a decade of experience in AI, including a transformative four-year role as a Team Lead at Meta, where I advanced Ads, Commerce, and Creator Recommendations with cutting-edge AI.
   * As the founding Data Leader of the Psychological & Mental Health pillar at TikTok, I contributed 1.5 years of expertise.
   * Most importantly, I’ve led and served spiritual communities for many years✨💫. Through my service, I’ve witnessed countless transformations—emotional and physical healing, job promotions, financial breakthroughs, finding the right partner, and countless other open doors. I’ve always dreamed of bringing these blessings to a broader audience🕊️🌱.

# MY LITTLE BACK STORY:

I got introduced to crypto at the tail end of 2017 bull run, and by the time I made my first purchase the main party was over and I had to listen to the OGs who were hungover and telling me that I need to hodl. And so I did. One of very first purchases was Digibyte, as it was killing it back then, along with a few other top gainers like XRP (Ripple at the time). Rookie move, I know! I bought the stuff that had gone up hundreds of thousands of percentages and was expecting to see them go to the moon and get rich off of them too! Lol, we all have to pay a price to learn!

Anyways, I held and watched my portfolio tank to 7-8% of its value: $100k -> $7700 at the end of 2018. But I never quit and saw the potential. And held through the crazy ups and downs of 2019, and the covid crash, and then the next bull run. During all this time, I've seen my portfolio get dirt cheap, and get as big as 7 figures. I've researched and invested in numerous crypto projects, learned how to do the more nerdy stuff like programming, making smart contracts, mined many coins including Digibyte for a few years, and seen 100x returns and total losses in my investments. One skill that I tried so hard to develop was to do proper emotion-less TA using every tool that is out there. And dare I say, I am good with some of them. Which brings us to this point in time. Digibyte has dropped to rank 300+ and lost steam, so there's no quality TA out there for it. The OGs would do their own things in the background and don't bother explaining to others. I thought about sharing these thoughts, so if you're a newbie in the community can see the potential there is. I see it as a way to give back to the community that I once learned from. Below I will try to summarize all I have to say about Digibyte in two major parts, fundamental and technical:

# FUNDAMENTAL:

1. **Decentralized, permission-less, community-driven, longest chain, no down time:** yeah yeah yeah, boooooring, what does it matter if the price action sucks?! Well, hear me out. This isn't my first rhodeo, and I'm here to say it does matter! Developers don't get a cut. There's no central/big party that controls the supplies, hence less chance of price manipulation. I don't think it's necessary to explain to someone who has somehow made their way to this post how ridiculous and scammy all those shiny meme coins are out there. In case you don't know, it literally takes less than an hour to launch your own meme coin with most of the supplies in your hand. People do it all the time and dump it on others. I've been there and watched a few of my investments go down to literally zero. Safemoon is a famous example for me. Better invest in something rigid.
2. **Proof of work with 5 mining algorithms:** Proof of work as non-sexy as it sounds in the first glance, matters a lot! There is a realized price for producing each DGB token out there, so the miners won't sell them at any price. Just like BTC.
3. **Layer1 you can build on:** Of all those OG coins out there, DGB is one of the few that you can actually build real life applications on. It's capable of handling smart contract, which makes it suitable for build Dapps on top of it, minting NFTs, and more. It has the awesome security layer. There's tons of documentation on these stuff, I'll suffice with just dropping some of those names and keywords in here so you can research for yourself.
4. **Regulatory clarity:** As an XRP investor, I've suffered the lawsuit SEC raised against the company Ripple. While as the investor I was and am, I cheered for Ripple to win all the time, some of those arguments SEC case raised against Ripple company were valid, too. There was and is a central party that controls a good portion of the supplies, and does a ton of development, either on the network or for the business. While the claim is that XRP is community-driven, it is clear as a day that is not entirely true. I'm really glad to see that case finally coming to a closure as it was rather hurting my investment rather protecting it. Don't want to get into that case any further, but the point is on the contrary, for some OG coins such as Digibyte, there is no central party or company that can cause a regulatory crisis! As long as Bitcoin is in the clear, so is Digibyte! As a matter of fact, Digibyte is even better than Bitcoin in that regard! Nobody knows who that Satoshi guy is, whether they're dead or alive, does somebody control all those 1 million Bitcoin sitting in that wallet which is worth \~100 Billion Dollars at the time of writing this. That would send massive shockwaves should that situation change for any reason. Whereas there is no mystery part in Digibyte's history! It's all clear!
5. **Super fast, dirt-cheap fees, truly scalable with real life applications:** I encourage you to try the transactions for yourself. Don't just buy on an exchange and leave it in your account. Send it to your Digibyte wallet and play with it. Try the wallet apps. See for yourself how brilliant this tech is for actually paying for stuff! It costs $0.00001 to move money around in a matter of 2-3 seconds! **IT IS A FREAKING HUGE DEAL!** When I was first introduced to Bitcoin, it was supposed to be the sound money! And I always wondered how can it be that it costs me $50 to move $100 and we're saying that is replacing the banking and payment systems?! Well, Digibyte delivers that promise. **YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO TO A COFFEE SHOP AND PAY WITH DIGIBYTE.** You don't have to pay any hefty fees and don't have to wait for 10 minutes like an awkward moron waiting for your transaction to go through! It just works!

I'm sure there's way more that can be said on the fundamentals of this great project. I just hope I have caught your attention. The rest is for you to research for yourself. Let's get into the more delicious stuff and wild price predictions!

# TECHNICAL:

The very basis of my analysis comes from Elliot Wave theory, but I also have other checks and balances as I'll present below:

1. **Digibyte has been in accumulation for 7 years:** I have been trying to do a proper wave count for Digibyte for almost 2 years now. Had to entertain multiple scenarios. My take is that the entire 2020-2021 price action was just a retracement

[Digibyte's running flat for the past 7 years](https://preview.redd.it/hf2e4mspmd3e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1879d80df2144eb284a23944c000b3678126d80c)

[Running flat text book pattern](https://preview.redd.it/bja328c4id3e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=033fa79dcee743e0f8d4fb76577ec236e5c61725)

The point above is key to understanding the logic of this analysis. That means Digibyte finished it's first impulsive wave upwards in the late 2017, and has been in accumulation ever since for almost 7 years!

2. **On the brink of its 3rd major wave:** Without getting any deeper in the technicals of Elliot wave, I'd suffice to say that I am convinced the following wave count is the correct wave count for Digibyte:

[Starting the awesome 3rd wave](https://preview.redd.it/kd3r00xznd3e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=24e18ac0ce8957f5cb12867ed05a7f1b04d5b30e)

Fractals are integral to Elliot wave analysis, implying that waves of the similar count tend to mimic and rhyme with each other. Meaning, wave 3 of the major degree rhymes with wave 3 of the minor degree. Meaning there's a very steep rise ahead of us! Check out below for the waves 3 of different degrees:

[24x in 51 days](https://preview.redd.it/sx6drtd4pd3e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0416266eddaf520efa32d551b6c20bd5b98129a9)

[309x in 91 days](https://preview.redd.it/9oret3xlpd3e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b318340e05d3b06939db18b69703d91a8da8a0d6)

There are of course many more examples of wave 3 in the chart of Digibyte that I could present of the lesser degrees, but I think these two would get the point across in terms of what ""steep"" really means. So exciting!

3. **Trend reversal signs:** The trend is reversing for sure. the monthly candle action with a decisive bullish engulf and the weekly momentums speak for themselves:

[Monthly bullish engulfing candle](https://preview.redd.it/a5vtjhgkrd3e1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=27cd0b14f29a1fd7e9bf7145e96f3a3a7fb59120)

[Weekly momentum indicators showing strength and signs of a bottom reversal](https://preview.redd.it/6s3bhe8rrd3e1.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=d410e6ad26045e66a4d3dc0e4bfdd9e3692c2dd4)

4. **Targets:** So, what are we looking at here for the targets?

See the following examples for the price behavior of the third wave I'm referring to:

[4.23 linear fib of wave 1](https://preview.redd.it/4q55ys5xtd3e1.png?width=1103&format=png&auto=webp&s=58781d6741ec8bc9d63848ed0ea2ef75286fb8ba)

While in 2017 bull run, the same 4.23 linear was nowhere near the top, a meaningful logarithmic 2 level appears on the top of the market:

[linear fib 4.23](https://preview.redd.it/lhoks4sdud3e1.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=c587cb52d89e2b3ff12b1a23522a1dd8ae018afa)

[log fib 2](https://preview.redd.it/rc6f8u5hud3e1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=70fa4f5d789b37c8d486a00bedc41d422a8a9990)

The examples above for the previous 3rd waves show that as expected, extent of the move is getting bigger, but also in a longer time frame.

Based on the analysis above, and of course EWT, 4.23 linear fib ratio of wave 1 is very much expected for a 3rd wave target, which means a glorious targets of $0.78, which coincides with 0.618 log fib:

[The red fractal reflects a measured move](https://preview.redd.it/6ktnljxnvd3e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ebcd1e1f2321871b0def54fcd7b98845b908b09)

But that's not even the best case scenario! As shown above, there was that time that 4.23 linear fib extension was belittled by the massive move. Not saying we should expect that every time, but hey, it is possible. So, the following depicts the log fib extensions. That $0.78 coincides with 0.618 and the measured fractal with the target of $1.5 falls right on the 0.702 fib level:

[log fib extension](https://preview.redd.it/7ks2ey82wd3e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=832c5ba4b6aacd0c42ee460cce7514b3ba43505b)

The $1.5 price mark would give DGB a market cap of \~26 billion dollars. With the total market cap projecting to go as high as 8-9 Trillion in this bull cycle, Digibyte would need to make it to roughly top 20-30 crypto assets to make that happen:

[Historical snapshot of the last market top](https://preview.redd.it/7nm2wkzcyd3e1.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b245f4173c33a097b3df869fe7fd19942ab4849)

With the Bitcoin price that I'm projecting to be somewhere \~150K-200K at the top of this cycle, the BTC pair will have to meet it's long term resistance one more time at $1.5:

[DGB:BTC Pair to go to \~ 0.00001, or 100K DGB for 1 BTC](https://preview.redd.it/38d4pt7hzd3e1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a96c265a5c8a83ef36f8e12c0f6dd2178906ec2)

Litecoin is another OG coin that has always had a meaningful relationship with Digibyte, both on the network level and the price ratio. 1 Litecoin = 500, 1000, and 2000 DGB are all important exchange ratio marks. With the $1400-$1500 price per Litecoin that I'm projecting, 1000 DGB per 1 LTC is a ratio that would make sense:

[DGB:LTC pair on the cusp of breaking out of the long term down trend](https://preview.redd.it/nifj7b590e3e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c066e4756ea3c687f57c7779be9dff2ae3c7bea)

Now I mentioned $1.50 too many times, just to say that as wild as it may sound, specially at the time of writing this where price action is boring and not so great, there is logic behind this, and it is an actual possibility. It doesn't mean that you need to play your cards accordingly.

There are of course many more lower and even higher possible targets. The purpose of this long essay! is not to give you financial advice. You choose how to manage your risks. From my perspective, these two targets, i.e. $0.78 and $1.50 hold the most weight in terms of probability. Managing risk is something else that needs another essay of its own, maybe even a longer one. As exciting as these targets sound, and as strongly as I believe in them that I was compelled to come out for the first time in my life and write so much about this, here's a piece of advice: **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY AND MANAGE YOUR RISK!**

5. **Time:** While among all the predictions that one can make, time is the worst and most uncertain, I would want to throw out something in the lines of March-April of 2025 for this wave 3 to have fully played out. But take it for what it's worth, it can easily go wrong. I have the least confidence in my time predictions. I would just suffice to say that once fully played out, we can look back at this 3rd wave and say hell yeah, that was very steep! And don't go buy options off of this!

This for the new guys primarily. Stuff I've seen and how I worked my way into being one of the top 30 valuable mechanics not just in my shop in the company with roughly 1000 mechanics some it will be back story. Some of it will be how to handle shitty coworkers and a questionable boss.  I'll do my best to break up each section into different parts almost like chapters.

HOW I GOT HERE

A little bit about me, born and raised in Michigan. I went college have a double major associates degree in auto and diesel repair. 
I've briefly worked in automotive and hated. I've worked for roush performance contracted out to Ford motor company. My primary position at roush for was a prototype mechanic. Part of my agreement with roush and Ford is I'm not allowed to work for any Ford dealership anywhere in the world for 5yrs. I've worked travel centers of America, it sucked ass. I've worked Penske wasn't terrible but and I quote from my boss ""you will live in die in the pit"" meaning I'll never go above a tech 3. I thought I knew it all and could do anything but I had attitude problem. 

From there I worked for a small regional trucking company and that's where I really grew, it was just me and my supervisor on 2nd shift and he taught me a lot. He let me do a lot of stuff most inexperienced guys probably wouldn't of had a chance to do. actually considered staying except being flat broke 27 days out of the month wasn't cutting it



HOW I BECAME VALUABLE

 I took a job for a car hauling fleet. I was hired on as B tech/tech 2 whatever you want to call it. After like 3 months I was bumped to an A tech/tech 1. My lead tech was a good friend of mine I took this job 3 months before covid happened in 2020. I was eventually laid off for obvious reasons. Didn't get called back til August that year. My attitude improved. My lead tech was fair our boss was hands off in the shop and just worked the computer. I primarily work on tractors I do everything. After treatment, electrical, engine performance, pms, tires, brakes, lights, steering and suspension, driveline, hydraulics, I'm the primary go to for all these things.

My lead tech essentially handled giving out work when I started there was 7 of us including my lead. 1 retired at the start of the China virus to save one of our jobs. So we were down to 6. The one old timer has his own bay that is spotless you could potentially have surgery. We had the red headed menace, the old Asian, me, the shop idiot, and our lead. My lead was supposed to take over when our boss eventually retired. However he didn't want to give it to our lead. Cost of everything started going up and 2 us myself and the lead both put in our 2 weeks. I was offered 2 other jobs. 1 was a shop supervisor and co-owner of the company after a year(there was something shady going on) the 2nd was a shift supervisor and 3 guys under me that I would vet and mentor. I declined both when my boss shot more money at me. Red headed menace got fired because he dropped a trailer and he fucked up the axles on an owner ops trailer. Lead quit and went somewhere else further up north. Last I talked to him he's miserable and unhappy and makes less than what he did. So that left us with 4. My near retirement boss promoted the village idiot to lead. This dude is the laziest, unstable, hostile, pain in the ass I've ever dealt with(I'll circle back to this). But a jobs a job and it paid well enough.
 In fall of 2022 we hired 5 guys. All 5 had anywhere from 0yrs to shade tree, 
1 was a shade tree
1 has 6 months
1 was a former plumber but worked in his dad's shop or something 
1 was in school 
1 was a truck driver trying to play mechanic

We split them up between 2 shifts, shade tree and school boy came with me

6 months, plumber and truck driver went to 1st. 
6 months was moody always late, would call off and always had the craziest excuse, that dude always had an excuse, didn't want to listen for shit. He quit because he didn't want to go to 2nd shift

Plumber was decently smart and could figure most shit out but he started to get lazy partially because the lead mechanic in 1st didn't want to teach anyone. Lead mechanic was always out to shaft this dude for any reason. He faked an injury and found another job

Truck driver was always moody, explaining anything to this dude was like trying to talk to a wall. He threw a punch at me because he was arguing with me because he didn't want to a wheel seal and oil soaked shoes, I said quit being a bitch and do the wheel seal and shoes. He didn't like that I said bitch and referring to him as one. 

School boy, idk how he thought school was going to help him he wanted to be on his phone and I basically had to hold his hand daily. I had him do a light on trailer and he somehow couldn't figure out 2 wire light. I tried with this dude for more than a month. The final straw for him was we were doing steer tired id shown him at least 10 times prior to this what should take an hour was turning into a 2.5hour ordeal. There was other things but this is the one that I said he's unteachable. 

Shade tree, shade tree celebrated his 2yr anniversary last week, we sent him to do some training last year. I think they are getting ready to send both of us to more training. He did hurt his back last year so he was on light duty for 6 months. But he's been doing awesome both before and after I can pretty much give him anything and he'll do it even if he doesn't know how if he gets to a point where he thinks he over is head he comes and gets me. He always wants me to check his work. He actually surprised me today I missed something on a pm, he caught it and I was like no shit the apprentice is becoming the master right before my eyes. He can do most everything I do, there's a few exceptions pretty much anything with the laptop and electronics is left to me as well as HVAC, transmissions and engine diag, however he can do king pins, wheel seals, disc and drum brakes, leaf springs, dog bones, lights, hydraulics, air compressors, high pressure fuel pumps, oil pan, eld stuff, liftgate electrical, trailer abs, air systems, light fabrication and welding, drive line stuff(never seen someone so excited to do a u joint or carrier bearing), dpfs, egrs, rarely misses anything big on pm. Shows up everyday. Takes his vacation he gets a 2 weeks of vacation starting in January. Next year (2026) he'll get 3 weeks. I was so proud of him I invited him to my wedding a couple months ago. He ask questions, he's rarely on his phone. Was always willing to stay late when we were 2nds together and for a year and half it was just me and him on 2nds, our shift started at 2:30pm there was a couple times we were still at work at 4am. All we did was work and then work some more. 

I was promoted to 2nd shift lead. Just me and another guy. We worked our dicks all last year worked well. Like really well. We worked way later than we probably should of, but we both like money and not much stopping us. Village idiot would go so far to try sabotage us, he convinced my boss at 1 point to change our start time to noon. Idk why I think mostly because he wanted to control us because he thought we didn't do shit all night. We were supposed to leave at like 830pm out of all those times I think we left twice at that time. Then it got moved to 1pm start same thing. It didn't matter when that didn't work he would stay late for no reason just to see what we do 1 of the 1st shift guys came on 2nd shift for a week and he was like fuck you guys actually do work. When I say work. Everything we would do in 1 night we out do everything 1st shift did in a week. We would have our own projects and pms plus we'd handle as many drive ups that came to the door. We'd be 5-7 trucks deep all loaded all had somewhere to be. We stayed late because  we new someone was physically sabotaging anything we worked on but also because we also knew that if we left it in the bay it would still be there the next day because village idiot refused to finish it. Even if was just put the wheels on. Village idiot said every truck in the fleet needed kingpins and spring pins every truck. Me and shade tree got so good at doing them that most of the time the only thing left was put the hubs or wheels back on. We were at 1 point doing either king pins, spring pins, or both 2 or 3 times a week. 1 month it seemed like it was every day we were doing it. Again village idiot would write up but never would do the work. My close to retirement boss asked me before he retired something about how much money we spent on that repair and how we have the highest cost in the company. I told him that out of the 30 or so king pins we did. 5 of them were actually bad. When he asked why I did them then, I said ask the village idiot he supposedly knows more than me, arguing with him is like arguing with a wall that argues back and if you're right and he's wrong he does everything in his power to screw you in whatever twisted way so much so he's likely the one sabotaging trucks. Village idiot was so brutal he'd walk around with a coffee in one hand and his vape in the other tell you how your doing your job wrong and then when you didn't listen to him he'd set you on fire or chase you around with a can of brake clean. Yes he actually did this. I said something to my boss he didn't want to listen. When our corporate overlords wanted an opinion from mechains how the shop was ran on an anonymous forum. Me and shade tree let them have it we detailed everything. My close to retirement boss became my retired boss. My replacement boss fired village idiot. Me and shadetree worked with our new boss to fire him. Village idiot in the span of 1 month ran over 2 brand new jacks, damaged a brand bay door and tried covering it up, ripped the landing gear off a trailer and we finally caught him sabotaging 2 trucks. This dude maniac. I talked to his ex because I was friends with her before they got together shed tell me how village idiot would come home every night and plot to try and fire me, she was saying that he was obsessed with the idea. She ended up leaving because she found he was pedo. 

Tldr, I became valuable by teaching the younger generation how to be a good mechanic. I had a play in firing 3 different people and forcing a 4th to transfer shops or as I like to call it getting rid of the cancer. I paid attention stayed up really late on my free time reading manuals and trouble trees for various code and faults that'd I commonly see. Watching videos of different common problems and reading forums like this with common issues related to what I worked on. I seldomly ask for help, if I do ask it because I've exhausted google, forums, YouTube, manufacturer trouble trees and I'm completely stumped. Also village idiot works for green and orange car hauler in Flint Michigan. So if you work for that company I feel sorry for you. He comes off as your friend he doesn't know anything he'll back stab you. If you run across him ask him to clock a brake chamber or to piggyback it, he also claims hes not an electrician.

A massive study just dropped in [Nature Microbiology that analyzed over 22,800 people](https://zoe.com/learn/coffee-gut-bacteria-zoe-study) and found something INSANE about coffee and gut bacteria. Here are the mind-blowing details:

• Coffee drinkers have **8 times more** of a specific gut bacteria called *Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus* compared to non-coffee drinkers.

• Researchers could literally identify coffee drinkers just by looking at their gut microbiome.

• This isn't just about caffeine - the effect was similar for both regular AND decaf coffee.

The researchers are suggesting this might explain some of coffee's mysterious health benefits. Basically, your morning brew is doing way more than just waking you up - it's potentially reshaping your entire gut ecosystem!

Pro tip: The study looked at people across the US and UK, and found this bacteria link was consistent globally.

1h0xzv0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h0xzv0,Book Review: Daily Coffee and Startup Fundraising ,"Overview: From someone who has spend a very small stint in VC space, this book feels like jumping in an analyst call with no idea what's happening to learning a dozen of hooks and nooks in an hour. 

It's a compact book that explains the very basics for VC space. 

Topics Covered: 
Ahuja has divided the book in three parts 

1. Basic 
Discussion will start from what is a startup, MVP, PMF, TG, GTM, and mine and yours anx everyones favorite - TAM SAM SOM 

The discussion will further move towards MIS and different key metrics you need to take care of. I personally admire how Ahuja gave specific number to each metric, instead of saying generalised stuff. 

However some metrics and number i question a little bit, and some i agree like it's written in bible. 

Part 2: Your Data Room 
This part of the book deals more towrads getting yourself prepared for funding - valuations,  financials, pitch deck. I absolutely adore the chapter: Building a financial model. In depth on how an investor thinks - DAU, MAU, Gross margin, unit economics,  etc. 


Part 3: Getting the deal through. 
Sincerely speaking i have just skimmed through this part. But i can give you a basic idea, this is where you would need a CA and a lawayer. This is where termsheet, and SHA will hit you, and everyother minute you will hear the word: ""Indemnity"" 

Personal Favorite from this part 
- Should you register in India or outside? 
- Term Sheet Clause and negotions Tip 


Personal opinion: short compact book. But the book in terms is too much ideal. Fundraising is a human game. A  AIF fund will work very closely if they are leading your round; and at the end; they look for founder's with whom they can build (at least in early stages) 

The only drawback: I was expecting little more case studies. 

Definitely go for it if you want to learn the basics of VC; however if you have some idea the book would not give you that many ahh moments 


*Saying this, the main reason for posting was to find more such books; specifically targeting Indian Ecosystem. Especially one with case studies. PLEASE RECOMMEND!* ",2,1732688778.0,Indianbooks,0,1.0,False

Statement furniture pieces are the key to creating spaces that reflect your unique style while offering functionality. Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to refresh your home, adding bold and beautiful items from a trusted [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) shop can transform your space effortlessly.

**What is Statement Furniture?**

Statement furniture is a standout piece that draws attention and anchors a room. These can include bold sofas, intricately designed coffee tables, artistic shelving units, or unique armchairs. They often feature eye-catching designs, vibrant colors, or innovative shapes, blending perfectly into modern and eclectic aesthetics.

When chosen thoughtfully, statement pieces not only serve practical purposes but also become conversation starters, setting the tone for your home decor.

**Why Choose Statement Furniture?**

# 1. Enhances Visual Interest

Statement furniture can act as the centerpiece of a room, breaking up monotony and adding personality. For example, a vibrant velvet sofa or a sculptural dining table can elevate the ambiance of your living or dining area.

# 2. Defines the Space

Using one bold item can help define the purpose of a room. For instance, a sleek console table with a minimalist design from a [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) collection can create a stylish entryway that welcomes guests.

# 3. Adds Functionality with Flair

Statement pieces don't just look good—they're practical too. An oversized ottoman or an intricately carved wardrobe combines storage with style, proving that utility and beauty can coexist.

**How to Incorporate Statement Furniture**

# 1. Start Small

If you're hesitant about making a bold choice, start with smaller statement pieces such as accent chairs, side tables, or a dramatic lighting fixture. Visit your local [home furniture shop](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) for inspiration and guidance on finding unique yet versatile items.

# 2. Complement with Neutral Surroundings

Let your statement piece shine by pairing it with neutral decor. For instance, a bold-colored sofa pairs beautifully with soft-toned walls and subtle accessories. This balance ensures your space feels cohesive, not overwhelming.

# 3. Mix Styles Thoughtfully

Modern interiors thrive on contrasts. Combine **modern furniture** with rustic or vintage accents for a layered look. A clean-lined modern dining table can be paired with upholstered chairs to add warmth and depth.

# 4. Focus on Quality

Investing in quality craftsmanship ensures that your statement furniture remains a timeless feature of your home. Look for durable materials and impeccable finishes from a reliable **home furniture shop** to guarantee lasting appeal.

**Top Statement Furniture Ideas**

# 1. Iconic Sofas

A bold, contemporary sofa in velvet or leather can become the centerpiece of your living room. Modern furniture brands often offer sleek, modular designs that combine comfort with sophistication.

# 2. Sculptural Tables

Choose a coffee or dining table with a distinctive base or material, like a marble top or geometric wooden legs, to instantly draw attention.

# 3. Dramatic Beds

A bed with a tufted headboard or canopy design adds a touch of luxury to your bedroom, making it a personal retreat that feels both stylish and comfortable.

# 4. Artistic Storage Units

Shelving units or cabinets with unique designs—think asymmetrical shapes or bold colors—can serve as both functional storage and artistic decor.

# 5. Statement Chairs

Add flair to any corner of your home with a stylish armchair or rocking chair that boasts an unconventional silhouette or fabric pattern.

Of course, money is a bit tight, so I had to use points which limited my choices greatly.  I ended up in a rinky dink town with nothing to recommend it except four safe walls away from my stbx.  
    I mostly had to work all weekend anyway, but I wanted to do something fun.  I noticed that there was a lake on the outskirts, so I decided to grab a morning coffee and head over there to see some birds.  The more I thought about it, the more excited I got.  It got to the point that I was really looking forward to it.
    So I finally get there, and I go to the bank and find a bench.  As I'm opening my app and thinking the bench is really uncomfortable (probably to stop homeless from getting too comfortable), I notice a pile of vomit in the grass in front of me.
     I get up to move to a new bench.  I have to tip toe through the goose poop, but I see that as evidence of good things to come.
    So I finally start birding.  I see some Canada geese, an acorn woodpecker, and a European starling.  Then, the skies open up, and it absolutely starts pouring.  I jump up and run back to my car.  That's it.  3 birds.  Three boring birds.",1,1732688692.0,birding,5,1.0,False

One day when we were in the kitchen area at work, I was making coffee. I asked him to pass the sugar he said “I thought you were sweet enough”. I’m not really openly gay at work but I guess he knew. Then I needed to administer pills to a client then he said “ I have a pill you can take”. I took it as a hint he wanted to let me give him a BJ. I’ve been into him since I first met him. We were on a weekend trip. I kinda wanted to ask for his number, but by the end of the trip he asked for MY number and stated he wanted someone to teach him medical techniques 1 on 1 lol. 

Now we talk on and off. He treated me to coffee but only had casual conversation. Now we have a movie date coming up soon. But he’s always talking about church and volunteer etc but I’m not sure if he would let me give him a BJ sometimes. He’s married but keeps making hints and knows I’m gay. How do I let him know I want to give him head? I hope he won’t get mad if I start rubbing on him during the movie lol HELP

Ps he pays for everything coffee, movie tickets. I just want to be able to be confident without making a fool of myself lol",1,1732688374.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
