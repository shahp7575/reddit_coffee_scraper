Did you used to struggle making small talk with strangers before? What‚Äôs helped you feel more confident in those situations?¬†

","In my country, loyalty apps aren‚Äôt very popular among medium-sized businesses, so I decided to create one! My initial approach was to conduct interviews with both customers and coffee shop owners to identify the needs for the MVP.

I landed my first client and offered them a 2-month free trial, which I thought would give me enough time to refine the app while they tested it. After a few meetings, the MVP is built! However, the coffee shop is currently busy updating their menu and hasn‚Äôt had the time to test the app yet.

I‚Äôve reassured them that using the app would require almost no effort on their part, but they still want to postpone testing until they have more time.

So now I have this unexpected ""free time,"" and I‚Äôm wondering: (Context\*\*:\*\* I‚Äôm 18 and will start college next year, so I‚Äôm trying to make the most of my time now.)

1. What should I focus on while waiting for their feedback?
   * Benchmarking similar apps and competitors?
   * Improving my backlog or brainstorming new features?
   * Planning A/B tests to address customer behavior uncertainties?

**PS**¬†My client has insisted on paying me for my work, but I‚Äôve declined since the app hasn‚Äôt gone live yet. Should I stick to this decision, or is it worth reconsidering?

‚ÄúThe situation seems dire, with employees being informed of closures at the last minute, leaving many scrambling to find new jobs. The uncertainty is painful, especially for the employees who have worked long hours to keep the restaurants running, even as their future hung in the balance.
Shari‚Äôs was more than just a restaurant. It was a place where families gathered, where memories were made, and where the coffee flowed endlessly into the night. The loss of this familiar staple in so many communities across the Pacific Northwest is a reminder of how fast things can change.‚Äù

1h96xp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1h96xp7/when_the_meet_greet_feels_a_bit_too_much_like/,When the meet & greet feels a bit too much like vanilla dating,"TLDR:

A promising POT, unusually long M&G with drinks and dancing, unfortunately she gets drunk and throws away a potentially good sugar deal. Spending a long fun evening with a girl, only for her to eventually make out with another dude, is something I experienced plenty times in vanilla dating, and I certainly don't want that in sugar :D

Full story:

I had all kinds of meet-and-greets over the past few weeks: walks, coffees, drinks, most of them on the shorter side, unless we ""broke the rules"" and transitioned into a full intimate date.

The one I had yesterday was different.

Single mother of two, 27 yo. We drank wine at a nice bar. Conversation was great, she seemed like a cool mom, and her attitude towards sugar was aligned with mine (wanting the first meet to be platonic, emphasizing chemistry, not seeming desperate for money).

At some point, she suggested going dancing for a bit, before we call it a night. We took a cab to a cool bar with a dance floor (but I wouldn't call it a club). Drank a bit more. Had a lot of fun dancing.

Took a lot of selfies together (on both her phone and mine), which I know sounds mega scary if you're a typical married wealthy high-status sugar daddy type, but it's not an issue for me, a young single average Joe.

This was fun, and very different from any other first date I had from sugar sites. Felt like a good vanilla date. Unfortunately, it also ended like some of my vanilla dates from the past :D

Something happened that upset her (nothing to do with me). She stormed off to the restroom and stayed there for ages. Then I noticed her talking to some dude. I gave her a minute, then I approached her, and from the interaction it was clear that our evening was over.

I saw them making out as I was leaving. Ouch.

Spending a long fun evening with a girl, and then seeing her end up in another dude's arms, is something I experienced in vanilla dating on more than one occasion, and it's something I'm absolutely not looking for in sugar :D

Some more details:

The thing that made her upset? She noticed her wallet was missing. When we found it, all the cash was gone (I saw she had cash in it earlier).

I wondered: is this some sort of a trick? Is she pretending that she lost money, gonna act all devastated, and hope that she'll get some money from me? Well nope, that wasn't it. She didn't wanna talk, cried a bit, and then stormed off into the restroom. Of course I considered making a generous offer to help her cover the loss, but she didn't even give me a chance.

Was she faking her interest in me the entire time, just to get a night of free drinks? Maybe. But at some point she starting insisting on paying for some of the rounds (which is how I saw the cash in her wallet). So it didn't feel like she's in it purely for free drinks.

I think maybe she was having a reasonably good time with me and was interested in the sugar deal we were discussing earlier that night, but when she lost the money, the strong emotions mixed with alcohol ensured that mother nature took over, and some charming dude (that probably approached her on her way from the restroom) suddenly felt more exciting than the sugar site guy that she spent the entire evening with.

And one final piece of the puzzle:

I could feel that it's getting a bit too late, the date was getting too long, and normally I would have suggested we call it a night. But at some point she arranged to meet with a female friend she wanted to catch up with (she was pretty much showing me her phone while texting the friend throughout the night, so I believe that's genuinely what it was). So we couldn't just call it a night and go home, and obviously I wouldn't just go and leave her there alone. So we agreed that we'll hang out until her friend arrives.

So not only was she a bit drunk and going through strong emotions after dropping the wallet and losing the money, she was also maybe a bit bored, because it was past the point where you would normally end the date and call it a night.

Anyway. Is there some lesson to be learnt, besides the usual ""alcohol bad""?",2,1733619191.0,sugarlifestyleforum,0,1.0,False

I found that the Yamaha Nmax 125 (2020+ I guess, can tell by the dashboard) suspension is pretty hard, pretty bumpy, luckily I wasn't carrying any Mcdonald's drinks or Starbucks coffees...

But it's really nimble, can do right-turn in mini roundabout fast but stable, also can accelerate to 60mph national speed limit pretty quick (a little bit slow from 55-60)...

The most annoying thing is the steering can only be locked when the wheel face left, I really hate that because I can lock the Hoonda Vision 110 face right, so I can get on easier...

Regarding to the test, luckily the examier didn't ask me how to check the belt drive because I don't know how, it seems u can only check when u actually open the engine cover...

On the road test, my nightmare came true, ask me to follow the road sign to Slough or Iver...

I am a food delivery driver, we use GPS navigation all day, we don't get used to reading road signs (Navigation), but luckily I nailed it...

Then, on the way, HGV illegally parked half on the pavement, blocking most of my lane, forced me to go to the wrong side, and my ""delivery driver anger"" came out unfortunately, I didn't wait all the oncoming traffic gone, instead I just squeeze through the gap at speed very close, i thought I gone fail as I looked at my mirror afterward, the examiner seems surprised because he has to catch me up afterward...

Then, another HGV (why the H so many HGV along my way), this time, the HGV was trying to turn right but swing to the left lane a bit, I tell myself, no, don't try to speed throught at the left, hold back, I took a deep breath and wait...

At the end of the test, got one rider fault, because I didn't pull out at a big roundabout fast enough, it turns out my examiner is a ""rush"" type as well...

Anyway, just a story to share for any food delivery drivers who wish to do the Mod 2, try to claim down when doing the test, don't do any thing crazy...

We started talking again and reconciled at the end of November (we are on the same page now). I know he dated a girl during that time and I know who she is. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to know any details. 

But my boyfriend told me he wants to know who I dated and he wanted details. I told him I‚Äôve been a lot of ‚Äúfirst dates‚Äù since we broke up. The reason the number is so high is because I was on a dating app and I barely spent any time talking to anyone on the app. I only matched with people I could see myself going on a date with and set up a 15-20 min coffee date. I was clear I didn‚Äôt want to go on a real date the first time we met and most guys actually liked that I wanted to meet right away instead of talking for weeks. I was not interested in going on a dinner date + museum and etc cause I didn‚Äôt wanna be stuck with someone for 2 hours + if I didn‚Äôt first meet them and validate their dating profile irl. I thought it was better to meet someone shortly for 20 mins max to get a feel if we have chemistry, make sure they aren‚Äôt a catfish/ or 10 years older than they claim on their profile. I feel like this type of dating isn‚Äôt comparable to actually being in a relationship or dating someone seriously. 

My boyfriend did not like the fact that I have gone on so many dates and feels like I went feral as soon as we broke up even though I didn‚Äôt even go on my first date until June and even then it was only a coffee date that lasted 40min. It didn‚Äôt even lead to a real date. Most of these coffee dates ended at that. Only a couple of them led to a 2nd,3rd meeting. 

After seeing his reaction I did not feel comfortable telling him any more details. We met on a dating app years ago and by the time we met we had already talked on the app for weeks and both developed strong feelings for each other. And when we broke up I did not want to catch feelings for someone I had not met yet and then ignore any red flags cause I was already attached. I thought my reasoning for dating like this was smart and made sense. 

But my boyfriend was  upset and felt like he doesn‚Äôt know who I am anymore. 

Because he was so upset about this I didn‚Äôt feel like mentioning that one of the guys I had dated during this period (only a few months) bought me a Chanel bag. I said I bought it myself (I wouldn‚Äôt blame it on my parents since they don‚Äôt have that kind of money) but since we have previously shared finances he figured out I did not buy it, but also because I‚Äôve never spent that kind of money on myself before. 

I did come clean or rather he said he knew someone else bought it for me and I didn‚Äôt feel like lying any more so I did apologize but the bag coupled with the dates has made my boyfriend feel like he needs to rethink this relationship cause he doesn‚Äôt feel like I am the same person anymore. 

I feel bad for lying cause I have always been honest and transparent in our relationship but idk I panicked in the moment and just lied cause I know he wasn‚Äôt happy about the online dating stuff either. But in my defense when we broke up I was 26 and my dating approach was different to how I was dating when I met him (at 19). And  when I told him about the bag he made me feel like a sugar baby or someone that slept with a man for a bag which is not what happened. He feels like our values don't align anymore but I don't see how me going on dates when we were broken up makes my values so much more different and an ah?

>TLDR: I went Extremely Severe in 2022. I made it back from the brink. I'm well enough to make videos again. So I'm using my platforms for ME/CFS advocacy.

Since 2016, I've been a professional YouTuber & Twitch Livestreamer.  
For all of that time (and some before it) I've been living with ME/CFS.

But in April of 2022, my typically '*Moderate-to-Severe*' ME skipped right over '*Very Severe*' and landed on what Whitney Dafoe calls: **Extremely Severe (Type C)**.

For 2 years, I was in and out of the hospital; in and out of my ability to communicate; in and **DEEPER-IN** to types of pain that medicine doesn't even have words for... All the while being psychologized by ignorant clinicians whose egos wouldn't allow them to Google something they weren't taught at med school.

Well, by slow and steady degrees *(and LDN, NSAIDS, and L-Carnitine)* I have clawed my way back from the land of hour-long seizures, aphasia, severe hypotension, sleep masks, and ear muffs. I am *MYSELF* again. Still mostly bed-ridden, and 100% housebound...

**But I am MY. SELF.**

And I intend to use the platforms I built for a decade as an entertainer, public speaker, producer, videographer, editor, and graphic designer... To serve as an ME/CFS patient-advocate, at large.

However deep you've been into the cave... Strike a match and check the wall. Those are *my* initials carved there. I've *lived* at the bottom of this pit. And I know where the footholds are to start climbing out.

I've read more of the research than your neurologist will ever bother to. I know what's at the core of this disease -- from the mitochondria, to the inflammation in the Pons, to the excess Fibronectin fueling autoimmunity. I can name six diagnostic biomarkers, stalled in research, *just off the top of my head*.

And now that I've got my voice back, I mean to disseminate the critical information that the *licensed physicians* don't have, and can't offer. My fiance and I dragged me back to the surface, alone, while MDs sipped coffee and wrote psych referrals. So I am *going to war* on the ignorance, ableism, medical harms, and bigotry that stifle and disenfranchise the ME patient.

***Let them rue the day of my remission!***

\*cough\* Ahem, anyway... Figuring out how to make this video - from the confines of a twin-sized mattress - proved that I *can* still ply my art, even with this disease. I just have to go about it in a very different way. A slower and more meticulous way. And making sure to put back every drip of ATP burned, before I use any more.

As for the video... It summarizes my personal story; it shares some of the things that helped me return from the brink; and it lays the groundwork for more to come.

I've color graded it with photosensitivity in mind. Watch it, if you can. Forward it to your caregiver, if you can't. And, Cthulhu-willing, you'll be seeing more of me, in future. *(after I take a good long break from this 2-month long effort)*

Okay, this is a lot. I'm going to try my best to explain this situation, but I can fill in gaps where needed after.
so, i met this guy on a dating app. we talked here and there for a few days before meeting, when we first matched he did tell me that he would only be in town for a few days. we eventually decided to meet for coffee the day before he was leaving. we met and instantly clicked. it was quite puzzling to me just how similar we were and how seemingly perfect our chemistry was. the date was cute, we even slow danced in the middle of the coffee shop together. the date went so well that i felt comfortable inviting him back to my house a little while later (not for anything but talking!) when he came he brought a bottle of wine that we drank while we talked all night. I can't tell you just how comfortable and calm i felt around him, and he would say that the feeling was mutual. we talked here and there about the fact that he had to leave the next day, in small comments. we talked about possibly seeing each other again when he's back in town for christmas and staying in touch until then. we kissed and cuddled, which was also the most perfect. he spent the night with me and left for home the next morning (8 hours away). I quickly realized that i was very shocked at how genuine, kind, and confident he was.

i've found myself in a position as i feel i found a person that i would mesh very well with. we have similar tastes, have been through similar struggles, and the chemistry and interest seemed to be there.

a few days after he got home and we had texted here and there - he hadn't texted me back for a day, so i asked him if he was still interested in talking. he said while he felt comfortable and really enjoyed our time together, he doesn't feel like he could maintain a long distance relationship. he also won't be able to come back for christmas like he had originally thought. he feels quite bad about what happened he said as well. (no need for him to feel bad, i'll add)

i texted back saying i understand that, and that i myself may not be in the best place right now for something but that i was still interested in being friends if he was open to that. i got no response.

what does this mean?

would i be crazy to just tell him how i feel and not try to play it cool?

would i be crazy to wait a month or so and check in with him?

should i just leave the situation be as is and move on? 

i really felt a connection with this person, which is hard to come by for me. i have always struggled feeling like i deeply connect with anybody, and this is by far the deepest i have felt. i feel sad at the thought of letting that connection die off.

l also know that it can be very impractical for a new relationship to be a long distance relationship, and i understand his reasoning - but i cannot stop this feeling.

note - i would 100% be willing to travel to see him often, i love driving and travel, so this wouldn't be an issue so long we could find times that would work :) 

any helpful words are much appreciated <3

also, i forgot to add this - i am 22 and he is 25! he also is in the military which im sure plays a part as well.

My initial approach was to conduct interviews with both customers and coffee shop owners to identify the needs for the MVP.

I landed my first client and offered them a 2-month free trial, which I thought would give me enough time to refine the app while they tested it. After a few meetings, the MVP is built! However, the coffee shop is currently busy updating their menu and hasn‚Äôt had the time to test the app yet.

I‚Äôve reassured them that using the app would require almost no effort on their part, but they still want to postpone testing until they have more time.

So now I have this unexpected ""free time,"" and I‚Äôm wondering: (Context**:** I‚Äôm 18 and will start college next year, so I‚Äôm trying to make the most of my time now.)

   * Improving my backlog or brainstorming new features?
   * Planning A/B tests to address customer behavior uncertainties?

Initial Sniff:

* This begins as a rich, warm, and sweet caramel and vanilla. It reminds me of caramel filling for donuts: velvety, luscious ribbons of melted caramel.

Drying Down:

* This veers into a completely different direction with the dry down and transforms into a very strongly brewed, slightly bitter, black coffee with a burnt caramel sweetness in the background. It‚Äôs also reminding me of wet coffee grounds: slightly earthy and damp with a highlight of warm vanilla. An hour or so later, that warm, decadent, heavily gourmand caramel vanilla envelops that photorealistic black earthy coffee. This becomes a game of tug of war between extra syrupy sweet caramel beignets and slightly burnt, bitter, dark rich espresso.

Several Hours later:

* This lasts a full day with the later hours of wear morphing back into the initial caramel beignets impression and farther away from that bitter coffee - what a ride! I would say that the scent mellows out smoothly into a sweet photorealistic gourmand but I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as fading in intensity. The initial projection quickly filled a room with bitter earthy coffee and oh-so-sweet caramel vanilla donuts and then sits a bit closer over time, sinking into a moderate but pleasant bubble around me for the rest of the day.

Living with credit card debt can feel like being trapped in quicksand‚Äîthe more you try to get out, the deeper you sink. Minimum payments barely make a dent, and high-interest rates keep piling on. It‚Äôs exhausting, overwhelming, and can leave you wondering if you‚Äôll ever break free.

That‚Äôs exactly how Emily felt. A few years ago, she was buried in $15,000 of credit card debt. Every month, she paid the minimum balance, but the interest kept growing. She started skipping nights out, vacations, and even small joys like coffee runs, but the debt refused to budge. The anxiety kept her awake at night, and she felt like she‚Äôd never escape.

What if the debt never goes away? What if you‚Äôre stuck in this cycle for the rest of your life?

That‚Äôs when Emily discovered the **Debt-Free in 90 Days: Accelerated Plans** program. The step-by-step approach helped her create a custom repayment strategy that worked with her budget and goals. She learned how to:

* **Prioritize payments**: Using the debt avalanche method, she tackled her highest-interest card first, saving thousands in interest.
* **Cut unnecessary expenses**: Small changes freed up extra cash each month to throw at her debt.
* **Boost income**: She used side hustle strategies from the program to supercharge her repayments.

Within 90 days, Emily had paid off two major credit cards, and within a year, she was completely debt-free. The relief was life-changing.

So much on social media as sugar bomb milky drinks.  While I'll indulge a couple times a year I like my coffee BLACK and bitter.  I like rich dark blends usually.

I make iced Americano (black) the most. Or iced Coffee (black).  I do like flavored coffee as a treat.

So I found a good deal on this product but I couldn't find much info on it with espresso machines, it does say ""Coffee machines"" though, but I want to be sure enough before using it.

It says it contains L Lactic acid, so I believe that's the active ingredient.

Hi all! 

My husband has a hobby in coffee making, and one of the toys he does not currently have is a cold brew drip tower. I am a big coffee gal myself, but know next to nothing about finding the right machines/brands. I need some help looking for a holiday present!

Any recommendations on cold brew drip towers?

The most important thing is that it has to be able to make great coffee. Some other characteristics I would prefer are nice aesthetics (statement piece?) and carafe that can make >1 cup at a time. He likes to entertain with his coffee gadgets! Also, anything that takes effort to learn/master would be great too. He likes the challenge!

I was looking at the zeroHero Dingyuan deluxe, but couldn‚Äôt find any reviews and wasn‚Äôt sure if it was actually good/worth the price tag. If anyone has this piece, I would love to hear your review!

Thanks in advance!!!",1,1733617165.0,coldbrew,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a first time Princess cruiser and not impressed with the level of service so far. Dinning in the Cielo the first and second night brought nothing but waiting, mediocre tepid food with lackluster service. We decided to go to the Marketplace and see how the buffet worked out and ended up waiting 20 mins for something to drink (coffee and water). The Crown grill was the complete opposite with fantastic service and exceptional steaks. We have been there again with the same high level service and flavors, the same goes for Sabatini‚Äôs where we were served the best osso buco ever. The same could not be said for Rudi‚Äôs seafood extravaganza, the fish, crab and lobster was slimy, smelly and on its last day of forgiveness. My fillet of beef was absolutely dry when I cut into it for something medium rare, I brought this to their attention which they acknowledged that the steak was cooked frozen then served. I have subsequently cancelled all of our follow-up Rudi‚Äôs dinners and will stay with the 2 winners. Unfortunately tonight was a repeat at the Marketplace where we were never asked or approached for a water or coffee. 

I think we‚Äôll have to stick with Holland American and Royal Caribbean.

1h965fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1h965fa/anyone_had_success_with_magtech_magnesium_for/,Anyone had success with Magtech Magnesium for preventing multi-day migraines?,"Since last year, every few months, I get hit with a multi-day migraine (not sure what triggers it, nothing in particular, I have a generally healthy lifestyle with exercise, nutrition, no regular coffee, not a drinker, no prescription meds, drink lots of water, take supplements).   
  
First migraine happened 18 months ago roughly, horrible pain, thought I must have a brain tumor or was experiencing stroke; went to urgent care thinking I might have something very serious going on. They sent me home with strong acetaminophen and diagnosis of a migraine. Haven't had even normal headaches throughout my life. Scared the heck out of me when this first happened.  
  
My migraines start with typical ocular symptoms -- blurry rainbow sparkle binocular vision, then I start feeling severe brain fogginess and then the inner brain pain onset escalates along with severe light sensitivity in my eyes. Pain gets very deep inside the upper part of my brain about 3""+ behind my right eye, and once in a while, the pain gets so severe, it feels like my brain is being ripped in half from the upper middle of my head inside. I've caught it early a few times and ate a caffeinated energy bar (Quantum), and the migraine was much less severe, or even subsided in an hour a few times -- seems the key is to catch it and treat with caffeine within the first 15 minutes roughly. Not sure, still experimenting. 

Someone I know who is experienced recommended Magtech Magnesium supplements (linked below on Amazon -- I'm not an affiliate). I'll try these, but wondering if any of you have tried this, and if so, how did it go (successful in preventing or minimizing the migraines?), any bad side effects (such as digestion or loose BM problems?)...Any reason why the ingredients in this one aren't ideal? And if that's the case, what is better and why? Thank you

It‚Äôs like the world‚Äôs most glamorous retirement village, where the only thing more abundant than golf courses are the people trying to convince you this place has a ‚Äúvibrant cultural scene.‚Äù Oh sure, if by ""vibrant"" you mean a handful of local artists selling overpriced trinkets to tourists who think they've discovered the next Napa Valley‚Äîspoiler alert: they haven‚Äôt.

The downtown looks like it was designed by someone who watched one too many episodes of *Fixer Upper* but didn‚Äôt quite understand the concept of ‚Äútaste.‚Äù You've got condos stacked like Jenga blocks, each one offering the same uninspired view of... another condo. It's a place where you can‚Äôt swing a cat without hitting a winery, but don't get too excited‚Äîmost of the wine tastes like it was made in someone's basement using grapes from a Costco-sized bag. 

Kelowna‚Äôs so-called beaches? They're more like glorified sand pits where the locals try to convince you that this is ‚Äúparadise.‚Äù Nothing says relaxation like the sound of kids screaming and the smell of sunscreen wafting through the air while you dodge rental jet skis that are just a touch too close for comfort.

So before starting strattera I already had issues with lack of energy, always needed coffee or redbull to get things done (and I wouldn‚Äôt take it everyday, just the days I really really need it, the other days I just didnt do as much or did less than the bare minimum).

I started taking strattera in september. The first 3 days all I did was sleep. Eventually the effect subsided but not much. I started increasing the die and now I‚Äôm on 40, but the sleepiness is not going away now. 

It reaches a point where I‚Äôll fall asleep whether I want to or not. I can barely do anything now because all I do is sleep and the little bit strattera had helped my adhd feels like it is being lost by my need to sleep.

If I take redbull with it I can stay awake better but the focus itself doesn‚Äôt improve‚Ä¶ anyone else? ",1,1733616694.0,Atomoxetine,0,1.0,False

1h961zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPAP/comments/1h961zd/finally_lowered_my_ahi_from_5_to_1_by_actually/,Finally lowered my AHI from 5 to 1 by actually following sleep hygiene tips,"
Hey everyone! I‚Äôve been stuck with an AHI hovering around 4-6 for months, and despite tweaking my pressure settings based on suggestions I‚Äôve seen on here, I could never get it lower. A couple of days ago, I decided to really commit to improving my sleep hygiene. I also have dust allergies, so I figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to take a more comprehensive approach.

After implementing a few changes, my AHI dropped to 1.1 for the first time ever, and for the past week, it‚Äôs stayed between 1.1 -2.2!

Here‚Äôs what I did:

1) Room Temperature:

I opened the window (it‚Äôs winter here) and brought the room temperature down to around 63¬∞F. I had been sleeping with the room at 71¬∞F before. According to sleep hygiene recommendations, the ideal sleep temperature is between 60-68¬∞F, with 65¬∞F being the sweet spot for most people.


2) Antihistamine:

I started taking an antihistamine a few hours before bed to help with my dust allergies.

3) Anti-Dust Mite Bedding:

I invested in anti-dust mite pillowcases and a mattress cover. I‚Äôve also been washing my pillowcases and duvet cover every three days to keep allergens at bay.

4) Caffeine Cutoff:

Stopped drinking caffeine 6 hours before bed. This one was a game changer for me.

5) No Food Before Bed:

I made sure to stop eating three hours before going to bed.

After implementing these changes, my AHI dropped to 1.1, and my sleep data has been so much better. My smart watch now shows a higher percentage of deep and REM sleep, and I wake up only once or twice a night instead of 8-10 times. I used to have around 1-1.5 hours of ‚Äúawake‚Äù time during the night, but now it‚Äôs down to just 20 minutes.

The improvement in my energy levels from going from an acceptable AHI of around 5 to an AHI of 1-2 has been significant. I no longer need an afternoon nap and find myself reaching for coffee less throughout the day.

I know these changes may not work for everyone, but if you‚Äôve been stuck at an AHI of 4-5 and want to try getting it even lower, I‚Äôd recommend giving some of these sleep hygiene tips a go. I know what a shock that actually following sleep hygiene recommendations would actually improve my sleep üòÇ but ya I kinda never got around to ever doing it before and in doing all these things it has made a huge difference for me!

Hope this helps anyone who‚Äôs wanting to get their AHI as low as possible!

Adrenaline raced through Hermione Thornton as she watched the battle play out on the view screen. Even though she was not in immediate danger from the alien vessel, the fast pace of the action had sent the emotions of the control room crew on a roller coaster ride. Everyone had been certain that with the arrival of the battlecruisers the alien vessel would be destroyed or driven off in short order. This certainty had waned rapidly as the human warships traded multiple salvos with the alien, seemingly inflicting no damage. The arrival of a Navy carrier and a handful of medium-sized warships hadn‚Äôt affected the balance of power at all, as they hung back near *Crescent Station*.



‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they attack?‚Äù the signalman asked. ‚ÄúThe carrier is almost the same size as the alien. It should be able to damage them.‚Äù



*In terms of scale, he‚Äôs right*, Hermione thought. *The vaunted battlecruisers are described as the most powerful ships the Navy has, but they are only a third of the size of the alien vessel. The carrier is much larger than the battlecruisers.*



‚ÄúThe carrier doesn‚Äôt have any big guns,‚Äù Ops answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not meant for a gun battle. It‚Äôs more like a mobile space station filled with strike craft and Marines. What puzzles me is why the Navy haven‚Äôt used their railguns-,‚Äù he broke off suddenly as the red energy lance struck the flank of the nearer battlecruiser.



The Navy vessel spouted bright orange explosions, followed quickly by a rapidly expanding cloud of debris. Everyone sucked in their breath, watching to see if the mighty ship would continue to come apart, and Ops hit the collision alarm as several large chunks of armor came hurtling towards the camera. The battlecruiser lurched sideways with the force of the explosion, then it wobbled back to a roughly similar course so that its artillery turrets could continue firing.



*That was close*, Hermione thought as she turned her attention away from the view screen and moved over to the Voxel operator‚Äôs station. ‚ÄúWill any of the debris hit us?‚Äù she asked.



The Voxel operator struggled to tear his eyes off the view screen. ‚ÄúUh, no. No ma‚Äôam. I think it will all pass clear of us.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, keep an eye on it, and tell me if there are any impacts,‚Äù she told him. The station was sealed up tight; but if it looked like the debris would hit a section of the station with crew inside they would need to give the occupants as much warning as possible to don emergency vac suits. She looked up as the rest of the control room cheered just in time to see the antenna-like projector on the nose of the alien vessel go spinning slowly off into the void. ‚ÄúVoxel, keep an eye on that,‚Äù she said quickly. *That‚Äôs not just another piece of space debris*, she thought. *Maybe the Navy can figure out a way to defend against that weapon.*



‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam,‚Äù replied the Voxel operator, tapping in commands on his screen.



Hermione turned to Ops. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù



‚ÄúThe Navy just nailed that alien with their railgun,‚Äù Ops answered triumphantly.



Hermione looked back to the main view screen and saw the damaged battlecruiser was turned to point its bow at the alien vessel. While she watched, the alien vessel fired its thrusters and accelerated slowly toward the second battlecruiser. The Navy ship maneuvered out of the way easily, moving to a flanking position.



‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, the Navy is launching small craft,‚Äù called out the Voxel operator.



*What are they doing? Are they launching a cleanup operation before they have destroyed the alien ship?* wondered Hermione. ‚ÄúHow many have they launched?‚Äù she asked.



‚ÄúMore than fifty so far,‚Äù the Voxel operator answered.



¬†*That was too many for a cleanup detail, at least the ones I‚Äôve seen. Maybe they think they‚Äôll need more because of how much debris they‚Äôre expecting,* she thought. ‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù Hermione wondered aloud, staring at the main view screen. To her surprise, it seemed as if the Navy‚Äôs battlecruisers were moving away from the alien vessel as it began to build up speed.



‚ÄúMaybe they think it isn‚Äôt a threat anymore?‚Äù the signalman suggested tentatively.



‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù mused Hermione. ‚ÄúBut they don‚Äôt usually let attackers go just because they can‚Äôt shoot back anymore.‚Äù



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre attacking with strike craft,‚Äù said OPS, pointing to the edge of the view screen.



Hermione had to move closer to make out the wave of tiny two-person strike craft zipping towards the alien vessel. She gasped in surprise and shock as a myriad of tiny blue flashes appeared on the hull of the alien vessel, and a moment later the cloud of strike craft blossomed into puffs of orange explosions. ‚ÄúVoxel, how many did they lose?‚Äù She asked, a cold feeling in her stomach.



‚ÄúAbout a third it looks like,‚Äù the Voxel operator answered. ‚ÄúThe rest are scattering.‚Äù



*Why? Why would they send in those tiny fighters when they had the two battlecruisers here? Why aren‚Äôt the battlecruisers tearing the alien vessel apart with their railguns?* Hermione watched as more orange puffs of exploding strike craft appeared sporadically on the screen. The battlecruisers began firing again, but only with their turrets as they kept station on either side of the massive alien.



‚ÄúMore small craft have launched from the carrier,‚Äù reported the Voxel operator.



‚ÄúWhat are they doing? They must see that they are just sending pilots to their deaths, why aren‚Äôt they attacking with the battlecruisers?‚Äù Hermione clenched a fist as more orange explosions appeared around the alien vessel.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù OPS said slowly, studying the battle on the view screen with a practiced eye. A few moments later, he pointed to the edge of the screen again. ‚ÄúBoarding ships. They‚Äôre trying to board the alien.‚Äù



*Well, that explains it*, thought Hermione. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be easier to just destroy the alien and collect the pieces?‚Äù



‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù OPS answered slowly. ‚ÄúMy guess is they want to capture it intact so they can study the technology in more detail. If they blow it apart, they might destroy crucial systems or components.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut they're losing pilots left and right!‚Äù Hermione answered. ‚ÄúIsn't there an easier way to disable the alien first?‚Äù



Ops shrugged. ‚ÄúCould be, but they would have to board it eventually to capture it. With a human vessel, they would need to board quickly before the crew destroyed any sensitive equipment or information. Once the Marines have boarded, they should eventually be able to take over control of the ship; or at least disable it,‚Äù he speculated.



‚ÄúThe alien vessel is still accelerating,‚Äù the Voxel operator reported.¬†



‚ÄúThe Navy better hurry up before they jump out of the system,‚Äù Hermione commented. With the threat diminished, now that the alien vessel didn't have it's energy lance, she was beginning to think about the repairs she would need to make to Crescent Station.



‚ÄúThey're still bound in-system, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù reported the Voxel operator.



*In-system? Why weren't they running?* Hermione turned to look at the view screen, watching the swirling cluster of strike craft and boarding shuttles alongside the massive alien vessel. The two battlecruisers seemed to just be flying close support now, maintaining the same course and speed as the alien. ‚ÄúVoxel, what's the alien‚Äôs projected course?‚Äù A terrible thought had sprang up in the back of Hermione‚Äôs mind, and she hoped the answer wouldn't be what she feared.



The Voxel operator was silent for a long moment before replying in a quiet voice, ""They are headed for low orbit of Crescent 3.""



The entire control room was silent for a second, then Ops burst out, ‚ÄúThey're invading.‚Äù



Images of Hermione's family on the surface flashed in front of her eyes, and she felt her knees wobble at the thought of the alien vessel crash landing on the surface. She steadied herself by leaning on her desk and taking several deep breaths. ‚ÄúGet a message off to the colony, and warn the Navy. They might be too focused on capturing the alien vessel to realize where it's heading,‚Äù Hermione said shakily.¬†



It took the signalman a moment to realize she was talking to him, and then he sprang to the task with fingers flying over his controls as he switched to the appropriate frequency. ‚ÄúCrescent Three, this is Crescent Station. We have a large alien vessel headed toward your low orbit, and we think they may be trying to land hostile forces. We recommend you prepare for an invasion.‚Äù¬†



There was a long pause, about twice as long as communications with the colony usually took to get a response. ‚ÄúCrescent Station, say again? It sounds like you are warning us to prepare for an alien invasion?‚Äù The incredulous voice of one of the planet's communication specialists came through the control room speakers.



‚ÄúCan't really blame him,‚Äù muttered Ops. ‚ÄúEven if he's been listening to the chatter, the idea that they are planning to invade when the Navy is attacking them up here might seem hard to believe.‚Äù



The signalman took a deep breath and spoke again. ‚ÄúYes, Crescent 3. There is a large alien vessel currently under attack by the Navy, but their current trajectory puts them in your low orbit.‚Äù After a short pause he added, ‚Äúunless they change course.‚Äù



There was another, longer, pause before the communication specialist replied, this time his voice breaking in panic. ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE TELLING ME THERE'S A FREAKING ALIEN INVASION? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHY ISN‚ÄôT THE NAVY DEALING WITH IT?‚Äù



Hermione winced as the panicking communication specialist shouted over the speakers. *He probably chose a position on the planet to avoid any danger from pirates or alien contact*, she thought, walking over to the communication terminal. ‚ÄúThis is Hermione Thornton, stationmaster of Crescent Station. Who am I speaking to?‚Äù she demanded.



‚ÄúDOES IT FREAKING MATTER? WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE FROM AN ALIEN INVASION!‚Äù The communication specialist shouted over the speakers.



‚ÄúPull yourself together,‚Äù snapped Hermione. ‚ÄúWe don't know if they're invading, or if they're going to burn through low orbit evading the Navy, or even if there are aliens aboard the vessel. What we do know, is they're headed toward the colony. So your job is to alert the Colonial Authority of the potential danger and let them handle it instead of acting like a headless chicken.‚Äù She let go of the transmitter and took a deep breath to calm herself.



There was a long pause, and Hermione wondered if she'd gone too far. Then a Scottish voice came over the speakers, sounding a lot calmer. ‚ÄúAy, we‚Äôll let ‚Äòem know, lass. Thanks for the heads up.‚Äù



Hermione smiled, recognizing the voice of one of the old-timers who operated the colony‚Äôs spaceport. She trusted them a lot more than the political appointees sent by the Colonial Authority. ‚ÄúAlert the Navy, just in case they haven't realized it yet,‚Äù she reminded the signalman before heading back to her desk.¬†



‚ÄúYes, ma'am,‚Äù he answered.



Hermione went back to her desk and sent out an internal communication, requesting all departments to report in with damage and casualty reports. There was not much she could do now that the alien vessel was moving away from the station, and as much as she would like to watch the battle play out her first priority was getting the station back operational. As soon as the Navy sounded the all clear, freighters and personnel transports that had been forced to flee the system would be returning; and they would want to get back into their normal routines as quickly as possible. She began typing up the dreaded incident report, glancing up occasionally at the view screen to see how the Navy was doing. The rest of the control room, besides the Voxel operator, didn‚Äôt have much else to do and so were watching the battle a little more closely.



‚ÄúAre they actually *trying* to collide?‚Äù Ops asked incredulously.



Hermione looked up, just in time to see the undamaged battlecruiser cut in front of the alien vessel. She flinched involuntarily as she watched the alien plow into the side of the battlecruiser, the cloud of debris more impressive due to someone having magnified the view screen. ‚ÄúWhat are they doing,‚Äù she blurted out.



‚ÄúBeats me,‚Äù answered Ops. ‚ÄúJust after the Navy acknowledged our report on the alien‚Äôs course, the battlecruiser sped up and then cut in front of the alien.‚Äù



‚ÄúCould they be trying to push the alien off course?‚Äù asked the Voxel operator.



‚ÄúBut they wouldn‚Äôt do that unless‚Ä¶‚Äù Ops‚Äô eyes lit up. ‚ÄúOf course! They have boarding parties on the alien ship, so the Navy isn't going to risk firing on the thrusters and accidentally blowing them up. The safer course of action is to force the alien off course with a collision. They probably evacuated the sections that would be affected by the impact, and now they can force the aliens away from the colony without endangering their Marines.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy would the best option be to ram them?‚Äù Hermione countered. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt a tractor beam work just as well, without damaging their ship or causing any injuries? It seems to me like the Navy took stupid pills with their coffee this morning,‚Äù she said bitterly. Ops stiffened, and Hermione instantly regretted the comment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said, rubbing her forehead. ‚ÄúIt just seems like the Navy is carelessly throwing away lives trying to capture this thing intact and wasting Captain Sigil‚Äôs sacrifice.‚Äù



Ops relaxed. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúI was good friends with Sigil too. This is the reason I left the Navy. The peacetime Navy gets too worried about the costs of running the fleet and so they start demanding everyone use the cheapest possible option. If all they are doing is chasing pirates and smugglers, that‚Äôs not a problem because none of those people are going to have anything close to what the Navy uses. Now,‚Äù he gestured at the view screen where the brilliant glow of the battlecruiser‚Äôs thrusters showed how much effort was needed to push the alien behemoth off course. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre faced with an enemy they were designed to fight; but they‚Äôre so used to thinking about how much each shot costs they can‚Äôt see the greater cost in lives and damage that comes with that cost-effective mindset.‚Äù



What Ops said made sense, but it didn‚Äôt change the current situation. Hermione could still see the little boarding shuttles flying back and forth from the alien vessel, dropping off more and more Marines; while the battlecruiser continued to push against the rounded prow of the alien vessel to force it away from the planet. Suddenly, a cloud of what looked like tiny fragments burst from the alien vessel in nearly every direction. ‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù she said, leaning closer to the view screen.



‚ÄúHundreds of contacts-,‚Äù reported the Voxel operator, then he stopped and stared at his screen in shock.



On the view screen, another cloud of fragments burst from the alien vessel; but the eyes of everyone in the control room were locked on the tiny pinpricks of thruster exhaust coming from the fragments. As everyone stared in shock and growing dread, the supposed fragments turned and aligned themselves to point at the planet.



¬†Ops broke out of the trance first. ‚ÄúSignal Crescent 3! Tell them there are hundreds of missiles or drop pods headed for the surface!‚Äù



Hermione watched in horror as more and more of the self-propelled fragments were launched from the alien vessel and headed for the surface of Crescent 3.

I got 5 hours of sleep and then had to go to work, had a small amount of coffee this morning, didn‚Äôt eat until I got off work (I only went for about 4 hours), had some food, and then I kept having this big pressure in my lower stomach that I needed to poop and it was hard (I‚Äôm on and off constipated due to IBS). The pressure got to be a lot and it honestly makes me panic so I took an enema and got some out, but in the end my stomachs still felt hard and kind of full. That made me freak out so I started panicking and feeling dizzy, having hot flashes, throat got tight, etc. My issue is with how weird I feel. Is it a good sign that I only feel my worst when I think about it? Like I‚Äôll feel weird but it‚Äôll get significantly better when I‚Äôm distracted, and then suddenly come back on me and make me freak out again. It‚Äôs a cycle. If I were actually sick how long would it take for it to come out since I‚Äôve been feeling weird for hours now, and if my panic is what makes it a lot worse, does that mean it‚Äôs less being sick and more just anxiety? It‚Äôs so hard to make the weird feeling go away. I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôm trembling. I need reassurance and just comfort I need a friend right now

1h95vbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1h95vbo/why_practicing_gratitude_can_transform_your/,Why Practicing Gratitude Can Transform Your Brain‚Äôs Chemistry :)),"Hey everyone,

I remember a time when I‚Äôd wake up feeling a weight on my chest. Even after over 50 therapy sessions and reading countless articles on mental health, I still found myself focusing on everything going wrong. The good news is that I discovered something simple but surprisingly powerful: gratitude. It‚Äôs not just about being nice or polite‚Äîgratitude can actually reshape your brain in ways most people don‚Äôt realize.

Here‚Äôs the science in plain terms: your brain naturally has a **negativity bias**, meaning it‚Äôs wired to focus more on negative experiences than positive ones. This used to be helpful for our ancestors who needed to watch out for threats at every turn. But today, it often leads us to dwell on setbacks instead of celebrating successes. The trick is that our brains also have **neuroplasticity**, which means they can change and form new connections over time. By practicing gratitude, you can nudge your brain toward noticing the good stuff more often.

Research shows that regularly expressing appreciation can increase levels of dopamine and serotonin‚Äîtwo key neurotransmitters involved in happiness, motivation, and emotional balance. Think of it this way: every time you acknowledge something you‚Äôre thankful for, you‚Äôre doing a mini ‚Äúmental workout,‚Äù strengthening the pathways in your brain that support positivity. Over time, these small acts add up.

I first realized how gratitude could transform my life during a rough patch. I‚Äôd lost a job opportunity I was excited about, and my head was filled with thoughts like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a failure and I‚Äôll never find anything better.‚Äù A therapist suggested I try writing down three things I was grateful for each day. At first, it felt forced: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for my comfy bed,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for coffee,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for my friend who texted me today.‚Äù But after a few weeks, I noticed a subtle shift. Instead of ending my day stuck on what went wrong, I started paying attention to small, positive moments. My mood improved, and I slept better knowing I had some good to hold onto, even on hard days.

Integrating gratitude into your routine doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. You might:

* Start your morning by acknowledging one positive thing about the day ahead.
* End your evening writing down a few things that made you smile or feel appreciated.
* Use moments of downtime‚Äîlike waiting for the kettle to boil‚Äîto reflect on something you value.

For me, technology made it even easier to keep up the habit. Here are some resources that‚Äôve helped me stay on track and make gratitude a natural part of my life:

**Resources That Helped Me Along the Way**

* **Books:**
   * *""Thanks! How the New Science of Gratitude Can Make You Happier""* by Robert A. EmmonsThis book dives into the research behind gratitude and its powerful effects on well-being, offering practical tips and insights.
   * *""The Gratitude Diaries""* by Janice KaplanThe author spent a year living more gratefully and documents how it changed her perspective, providing relatable examples that inspired me to stick with my own practice.
* **Podcasts:**
   * **""The Science of Happiness""** (from UC Berkeley‚Äôs Greater Good Science Center)Each episode explores research-backed strategies for increasing happiness, including gratitude experiments you can try at home.
   * **""Ten Percent Happier""** with Dan HarrisOffers down-to-earth conversations about mindfulness and well-being, frequently touching on how acknowledging what‚Äôs good can reshape your outlook.
* **Apps:**
   * **LePal**Created by a friend who once worked at Google and overcame severe depression, LePal is designed for those who can‚Äôt afford therapy or feel intimidated by it. It has a ‚Äúspirit pet‚Äù that guides your journaling, encouraging you to note three things you‚Äôre grateful for each day. The pet provides thoughtful feedback (it‚Äôs wild how motivating a virtual cheerleader can be), and there‚Äôs a ‚Äútherapy planet‚Äù available 24/7 for venting about daily worries. The spirit pet even sends weekly letters about your growth, adding a personal touch that keeps you engaged. It‚Äôs been my go-to companion for weaving gratitude into my daily routine.
   * **I Am**
   * This app goes beyond sending random affirmations; it lets you tailor positive messages to your personal goals and values. You can choose themes like building resilience, nurturing self-esteem, or cultivating gratitude, and schedule reminders throughout your day. I‚Äôve found that reading a timely, encouraging statement‚Äîlike ‚ÄúI‚Äôm strong enough to face challenges‚Äù or ‚ÄúI deserve understanding‚Äù‚Äîcan gently push back against my negativity bias. On tough mornings, it‚Äôs a subtle shift from feeling overwhelmed to thinking, ‚ÄúOkay, maybe I can handle this.‚Äù¬†
   * **Insight Timer**Beyond just a meditation app, it has free talks and guided sessions that often include gratitude practices. The community aspect makes me feel less alone in my journey, and it complements the positivity I‚Äôm trying to cultivate.

**Final Thoughts**

Gratitude won‚Äôt make all your problems disappear, but it changes how your brain responds to them. By consistently recognizing what‚Äôs good, you strengthen the neural pathways that support resilience and emotional balance. Over time, you might find yourself feeling lighter, kinder, and more hopeful‚Äîeven on days that aren‚Äôt perfect.

If you‚Äôve tried gratitude or have your own tips, I‚Äôd love to hear about it. We‚Äôre all in this together, learning to give ourselves permission to appreciate the little (and big) things life has to offer. Take care, everyone.

Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

First, I eat ~2000 calories, mostly in carbs.

In this is 400g of raw beets, 12g of raw garlic, 12g of raw ginger, and 8 grams of cinnamon.  Apparently garlic makes nitric oxide better or something idk.  I didn't do much research.

Along with this, I take (these are extracts, idk if the numbers actually make sense):
800mg tongkat Ali
2000mg saw palmetto 
7200mg Siberian ginseng
800mg cistanche tubulosa
1000mg horny goat weed
150mg maca extract
200mg tribulus terrestris 
80mg yohimbe 
80mg l-arginine

Once that's all digested, I drink 4 cups of black coffee.

After that, I take my pre-workout:

10g beta alanine 
10g citrulline malate
2g ashwaganda extract
5g creatine (might as well get all the powders in one go)

After that, I eat an entire raw habanero, chewing it for 30 seconds before swallowing.  I think this makes my pre-workout kick in faster, idk.  My gym is only 10 minutes away from my house.  Also it's funny, and I'm pretty sure I just like feeling like I'm about to die at this point.

Then I go to the gym and lift weights like a gorilla psychopath for 2-3 hours.

so one day in the summer, when i was around 14(f), my mum i went into the shopping centre in my local town to sort out some birthday presents for my family. it was a hot day and i was thirsty, and there was a starbucks across the street just opposite the shop we were in. i told my mum i'd be ten minutes and would meet her back there once i got my drink.

i went into starbucks, ordered my drink and stood off to the side to wait for it like i usually did. just for some context, this wasn't my most local starbucks but it was still pretty nearby to where i lived - i used to go in there sometimes with my friends on the way home from school. the point is that i was pretty comfortable in there and i knew the area super well, so i didn't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen.

while i was waiting for my drink, a man walked in, wearing a hoodie and sweatpants with his hood up and almost covering his face. this wouldn't have been too suspicious if it wasn't in the middle of summer. the weather in london changes a lot but i specifically remember this summer being really hot, so it was a little strange that he was dressed like that.

the next red flag i noticed was that he didn't order anything, he walked straight past the line and came over to the waiting area. but still, maybe he ordered on the app? so i didn't think too much of it.

i was standing pretty near the wall, and he came and stood very close to me, not taking his eyes off me the whole time. now that he was closer i could tell that he was a lot older than me, probably nearing middle age. he stood silently watching me as i desperately tried to avoid eye contact. i didn't want to give him any idea that i wanted to have a conversation or that i wanted anything to do with him at all. i would also just like to clarify that there were a lot of different people in there who would've noticed what was happening, but this didn't stop him.

after a few more moments of silently staring, he spoke to me in a low, chilling voice that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. ""so are you in here alone?""

what fucking grown ass man talks to a 14 year old like that??? also, what makes it even weirder is that i've always looked young for my age. i'm 19 now and i still get mistaken for a 16 year old, so i probably looked about 12 when i was 14, which makes it even more gross on his part.

""no, i'm with my mum."" obviously, my mum wasn't with me in starbucks, but thank god for my quick thinking skills. i pointed in the general direction of the door, where about four different women were each sitting, kinda suggesting that one of them was my mum.

he turned his head and looked around the place before looking back at me and taking a step towards me with a gross kind of smirk. ""you sure about that?"" i took a step back to get away from him, but i was already standing pretty close to the wall, so there wasn't much more space for me to move into.

""yes, she's waiting for me.""

""how about you come with me instead?"" he took another step towards me and now i was cornered. he was so close to me and i felt like he was caging me in. there were so many people around who were watching this happen and not a single one of them stepped in to help me, a 14 YEAR OLD GIRL being cornered by a GROWN MAN.

he then mentioned something about his car being outside and said i should come and get in it with him. luckily, they then called my drink out and i reached my arm out to grab it. i managed to slip out from between him and the counter where my drink was, and i told him i really had to go. he took a few more steps closer to me and kept telling me about how i needed to get in his car. i'd never ran out of a coffee shop so quickly and i sprinted across the road to get to my mum. he didn't follow me out, thank god, but i was looking over my shoulder the whole way home.

the way he came into the starbucks with his eyes on me like he had a mission was something i'll never forget. was he watching me before i went in? how long for? and why did he choose me?

so to the man in starbucks who tried to get me into his car and potentially kidnap me, let's never EVER meet again.",1,1733614384.0,spoopycjades,0,0.99,False

One of the girls asked for bath and body stuff and she got her a sugar scrub and some sheet masks from Target. Nothing wrong with Target products, but that is not what she asked for and you have all the time/money to buy what she actually wanted. Also she asked for a nail kit, and just got a bunch of nail polishes in a pack...that is not a nail kit.  One of the other girls wanted stitch and she got the first stitch thing she saw.

I've been on a wild journey trying to find the perfect espresso machine, and I wanted to share my experience with you all. After months of research and countless cups of coffee, I finally found what I was looking for ‚Äì a Breville espresso machine.

I know many of you have been asking where to get one, and trust me, I've been there. I checked local stores, specialty coffee shops, and even considered second-hand options. But here's the thing: I discovered that buying online is actually the smartest way to go.

The main reason? Price comparison and availability. When you're investing in something like a Breville (which, let's be honest, isn't cheap), you want to make sure you're getting the best deal possible. Plus, physical stores often have limited stock, especially for the more popular models like the Barista Express or the Bambino Plus.

Through my research, I found that Amazon consistently offers the best deals on Breville machines. They usually have the full range available, from entry-level to professional-grade models. You can check out their current selection and prices here: https://athometouch.com/breville

What I really love about buying online is that you can:
- Read real customer reviews
- Compare different models side by side
- Get detailed product specifications
- Often find better prices than in stores
- Have it delivered right to your door (super helpful because these machines are heavy!)

Speaking from experience, make sure to check the warranty information before buying. Breville offers solid warranty coverage, but you want to ensure you're buying from an authorized seller. That's another reason I stick to well-known retailers.

A quick tip: if you're planning to buy one, keep an eye out for seasonal sales. I've noticed that prices tend to drop during major shopping events like Black Friday or Prime Day. Also, don't forget to check if your credit card offers any cashback on large purchases ‚Äì every little bit helps!

For those wondering about the setup and maintenance, Breville machines are pretty straightforward. They come with detailed instructions, and there are tons of helpful videos online if you need extra guidance. Most models include everything you need to get started, except for the beans of course!

What really sold me on Breville was their balance of quality and user-friendliness. Whether you're a complete beginner or a coffee connoisseur, their machines are designed to help you make great espresso at home. Trust me, once you start making cafe-quality drinks in your kitchen, you'll wonder how you ever lived without one.

Hope this helps you in your espresso machine hunt! Let me know if you have any questions ‚Äì I'd be happy to share more about my experience.",1,1733614097.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

We can share pics right away to not waste each other‚Äôs time.

To make things easier i can say a few things about my looks: 5‚Äù11 (180 cm), 165 lbs (75 kg), blue eyes, black hair, broad shoulders, deep voice, nice smile, good heart.

Second most important thing for you is who i am and what i like.

I‚Äôm a man of strong moral fiber. I value honesty, loyalty and kindness. I treat people right and i‚Äôm willing to help whenever i have a chance, i also care for my family which is super important to me. I see myself as a conservative person. I hold traditional values and i got much respect for religion and history. Individual freedom and free speech is all i‚Äôm about, also i‚Äôm a pacifist, i will defend my family and close ones with all i have, but at the same time i‚Äôm not looking for troubles and not getting into fights, that was never my thing, i like to resolve problems with words, not fists.

Shared interest paragraph is ready to go. I like to read a lot, i also write some stuff, im getting ready to publish my book one day (all i need is more inspiration from You, pleas be my Muse).

Music is my thing, i‚Äôm going to a lot of concerts and festivals, road trips, playing eight ball and soccer, watching youtube channels about history, science, cosmos and some other topics, i‚Äôm watching a lot of tv series and movies, like to spend time outside by walking or hiking, i like outdoors but i‚Äôm also a huge fan of spending time in bed and doing nothing.

Favorite music: too many to write them all down but grunge like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, some britpop or rock like Oasis and Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, Kings Of Leon, rap Drake, Kid Cudi, J Cole, some rnb like Majid Jordan, Jorja Smith, The Weeknd + dance or electro music like Tourist, Kaytranada and just much, much more :)

My favorite writers to name a few are Kerouac, Murakami, Vonnegut, Shakespeare, Bukowski, Fitzgerald, Sallinger.

Favorite director is definitely David Fincher, although i like Tarantino and Linklater and many more.

I love everything about 90s - music, movies, television, soccer, games, fashion, JUST VIBES in general. It was such a good time, good days. I like to rewatch movies from 90s from time to time, some funny comedies but also some romantic movies or both, recently i did it with Notting Hill, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, both are awesome! I can watch anything with Brad Pitt.

WHAT IS MY GOAL PART 2/WHAT I‚ÄôM LOOKING FOR

As for the kids - i even have some names for kids that we can discuss it. I know how hard it is growing up without a father figure that‚Äôs why i always wanted to give that to my children, a big and happy home where dad and mom loves each other a lot and sending this vibe to their children. I also want to show to my kids all the books and music albums we love so much and i want to be for them always to raise them well! So if you are up for that - awesome!

I want a woman who is ambitious, i want her to support me cause i will do the very same thing. I want you to watch a soccer game with me willingly and i want you to invite me to your world, show me what you love and i want to be in it for you, even if it means watching a silly show in tv. Whatever makes you feel good, i want to be a part of it. Support, support, support and don‚Äôt kill the other person‚Äôs vibe, i‚Äôm up for it.

I want a woman that is willing to talk about our feelings and everything, cause a real talk is the most important thing to build a strong foundation. Let‚Äôs talk and don‚Äôt hide our feelings.

Life is worth living and it is way better to spend it all with the person you love, i want to find that person here. Maybe that is You? Let‚Äôs find out.

Also, the last thing - i‚Äôm not a complete dumbass, sometimes i‚Äôm just a silly boy!

FIND ME A GIRL AND I WILL MAKE HER HAPPY.

Also i want to include one of my fav quotes:

'Cause when you talk about these things, something ignites in you, and I can see it on your face.
And I don't see that on a lot of people. And, you know, whatever that feeling is, when you feel it, I feel that too.

And it's not just here. It's... It's afterwards. What I'm trying to say is i really like the way that I feel when I make you feel the way that you do.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs burn like stars, together, xx

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.¬† I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

- she is a big coffee person, potentially something coffee related? A mug?

- She is currently studying for the BAR and wants to pursue a career in Law. Maybe I should get her something in her related field? 

- She's been wanting a pasta maker and asker mom for one but ended up getting a toaster oven, I wanted to get her one and brought up the idea but she said she doesn't need one. Do I just get the pasta maker?

- her and I go on many hockey dates to see the NJ Devils play, I got her a quarter zip and a ear warmer headband thing during Thanksgiving. Idk if should get her something hockey related again?

1h9509b,https://www.reddit.com/r/FromTVEpix/comments/1h9509b/saturday_sleuthing/,Saturday Sleuthing ," Let me start off by first apologizing for this absolute mess of my thoughts on possible theories. And secondly this all started because I ate two gummies, and smoked a blunt. Let the Charlie Day meme begin ..

During my rewatch, after Ethan wakes up in RV he says, ""I saw it. I saw the Lake Of Tears. It was a drawing on the wall. There was so many drawings on the wall. (Starts showing Victor's room, & all of his drawings on the wall) Ethan continues narrating his dream, ""like when I used to draw with crayons, & you would put it on the fridge."" he tells his father. (Panning to Victor drawing with crayon depicting a car accident) Ethan continues, ""And we were all there in the drawings. You & me & Mom & Julie, but somebody screamed because the spider came down from the ceiling.""

 I am beginning to question if maybe Miranda had a psychotic break of some sort, and brought her kids nightmares to life. Literally? Or in her own head? I'm not exactly sure. She had created multiple bottle trees ""in real life,"" & all of the artwork in the basement would suggest it's not only real, but all consuming! Did she possibly leave Henry? Is he maybe not a good man, did they party more than implied? Went & dropped acid that *last time* & kind of got lost in the sauce, stuck in that mental state on a constant ""loop"" ..

I've said it before, & was made fun of -- but the premise of this place is VERY generic, & surrounded with primary colors. YELLOW in particular. All of  the lamps offer that warm/cozy feel. Kids from the now timeline probably wouldn't imagine that effect, because they're used to the white/blue lighting nowadays. It just goes back to the time of the town as well. Very 50s/60s looking aesthetic. Not to mention the electric being connected to nothing, yet working just fine. The weather never changing (until it did) the food (peaches) just being there, like your mom went to the store for you, or however that works?! The hotel/pool/vacancy sign. Yet, no hotel -- like a kid on a car ride, just taking in the world. It all seems like an innocent attempt by a child to create their own world of imagination .. yet, the aggressiveness of the actual place seems far too advanced.
    
 The primary colors that I always pick up on suggest basic art class that a child would be familiar with. Blue, yellow, red are blatantly obvious throughout: 
  ‚Ä¢ Fatima's cardigan
  ‚Ä¢ Victor's yellow car smashing into the 2nd car that he's drawing when we first meet him
 ‚Ä¢ coffee cups/glasses/plates obviously in focus, & bright 
 ‚Ä¢ lawn chairs, bicycle, flower bouquet 
 ‚Ä¢ the original house Tabitha/Jim moved into had 3 windows with 3 curtains - can you guess the colors?

Also, Joni Mitchell ""Blue"" references drugs -- which seems to be a common reference throughout. Acid, weed, heavy drinking, Marielle the ""junkie,"" Tobey/Jade showing up high as hell running in to Miranda's reincarnates, & the ""story"" starts all over again ..





Could it be a Heaven/Hell purgatory? One thing that Fatima said is there are no mistakes, just choices. Also noting that if you climb up high enough, even nightmares can look like a dream.

Which brings me to my next theory. I am reminded of Bonnie Bennett (a witch from TVD) who became so broken-hearted that her pain basically created an ""other side."" Where Hell .. was a *pocket dimension* if you will .. 
 .. whether this is connected or not, Victor's trees always point up (triangular shaped) towards the sky, which reminds me of Jade & Jim wanting to reach the highest point, for a signal. Which made me think of another conversation within the FROM universe -- Kenny says to Jade, ""You're going to lose your mind. Okay, because that's what happens to people who can't adapt -- they can't bend, so eventually they BREAK!"" Sara tells her brother about the ""little girl in a room with broken glass."" Later we see her trying to piece together a snowglobe that was connected to her brother .. right?

YOU CAN'T BREAK ME!!!  

When you're at your lowest, you hold on to hope. Especially reliving the same nightmare over & over & over & over ..  

.. unless you redeem yourself, & ascend to Heaven!? Or tf up out that hell hole .. 



So *according to Jim,* the way you problem solve is by asking EVERY question that might apply. No matter how crazy, no matter how unlikely ...
So could Miranda's pain, the ""Lake Of Tears"" actually be what caused this place? OR could it be the overactive imagination of a child watching their mother lose her mind? Is it possible Miranda & Henry had another child that died, & that's what made her mind create this place??

Is it possible that Henry is MIY, & Miranda chose to run from him with the kids? I always questioned where Victor's gun originally came from. Did Miranda and Henry have a fight? Did he catch her trying to leave? Did they have an argument, threats were made, a gun was drawn? Henry does pull one out on Tabitha ... 

Or did Miranda experience the loss of a third child? Is there any indication of that at Victor's house? I need to rewatch ..

The town is surrounded with Anghkooey kids asking the reincarnates to remember. Which brings me to my next point .. Julie's bratty ass in the first season arguing with Tabitha about her having other kids. Meaning the last 14 months (Tabitha referenced that time frame during a fight with Jim so I assume that's when Thomas died) she's been an absent mother to her ""2  other kids"" 

Julie/Ethan VS Eloise/Victor - did they also experience the loneliness that Julie clearly felt, always involved with their bullshit parents fighting, or the desire to be a happy family again?!

Could Victor/Eloise's pain have caused/created a pocket dimension like Bonnie from TVD? Did they experience absent parents during their difficult loss? Or did Miranda actually lose it? And she's lost inside of her mind with only the drawings her children gave her so many years ago? Which would also explain how Victor survived all of these years. She lost one kid (maybe 2) but  together in her mess of a mind with their made-up world (his drawings) .. it's better than her reality ..

Which brings me to my final point, another conversation in town  --  Tom & Jade about Schrodinger's cat being the paradox. You put the cat in the box and you close the box. As long as you never open it again, theoretically, the cat is alive & dead at the same time .. ""so people back at home, to them wondering if we're alive or dead, we're both things, at the same time""

\[Spoilers for many of the game stories, especially Mini & Max. I just finished playing at least a bit of each of the 50 games, and I thought this would be fun to write up. Like the Pixar thing, it's silly and objectively nonsense, but, well, here it is.\]

In prehistory, cavemen and dinosaurs coexist until the dinosaur Emperors provoke them into battle (Rock On! Island). Why did the idea of war so greatly empower the Emperors?

Hundreds of thousands of years later, in the medieval period, society is still defined through the conflict of kingdoms that define themselves around abstract concepts like ""red"" and ""blue"". Their wars are sometimes fast (Attactics) and sometimes slow (Lords of Diskonia), but always pointless. These wars aren't limited to humans either ‚Äì¬†red and blue ants fight over patches of dirt (Combatants). It is only rarely that those aligned with red and blue can cooperate, and it requires a motivating cause like wanting to eat a sandwich (Ninpek).

In the 17th century, the devil Malus ‚Äì¬†where did it come from? ‚Äì threatens human society and can only be defeated by turning away from God and toward alchemy (Devilition). But this doesn't always work. A group of 19th-century train robbers including Maria (Rail Heist) are in Texas when it descends into hell, where Maria is among the chosen ones to save humanity from Malus (Grimstone). In the process, War itself is defeated. And yet human violence persists. Why?

It is around this time that humans first manage to access ‚Äì with the help of magical cacti¬†‚Äì the dream realm. A surreal world of eggs and of vivid greens and magentas, populated by beings with inscrutable agendas: hatched knights (Barbuta), diving lizards (Divers), mooncats (Mooncat). Sometimes a part of this world of dreams can bleed into the real world (Valbrace). Time and consequences work differently here. Also there's eggs.

Back in the real world, samurai have found a way away from violence through games. Specifically, playing ping-pong with swords (Bushido Ball). Perhaps the act of play bears more power than it seems? But games can still be violent, especially when the colors red and blue are involved (Paint Chase).

In the 20th century, Vishmi, a marine biologist, leads a submarine expedition to the bottom of the sea (Porgy). There, she receives a dire warning about the consequences of human selfishness. Whence the strange power she receives once she becomes aware of this injustice?

Vishmi's son Chandar is in the same school as with a certain Amy, where they play sports (Hot Foot). This same Amy grows up to be a teenage party queen who throws regular wild parties at her house (Party House), while locking her poor little sister Mini in the storage room. There, after many adventures, Mini finally meets Pongo themself, the answer to all our questions (Mini and Max).

Since time immemorial, the mysterious creature Pongo has animated the world with the power of imagination and play. They are a god who presumably hails from the dream realm of eggs. Their magic of imagination has brought magic and wonder to the world, and sometimes justice, but also destruction. It is Pongo who brought Malus and Biggan into being from man's belief, Pongo who gave the colors red and blue such antagonistic weight. Even when the god of War has retired, the human imagination will never be free from the idea of power and violence, and Pongo makes these imaginings real.

After meeting Mini, Pongo brings to life many animals and inanimate objects to have adventures, and so that these animals and objects can assert themselves and their identities: A walrus has a magical oceanic dream and saves its community (Waldorf‚Äôs Journey), sports fight each other for supremacy (Kick Club), a golf ball explores the course (Golfaria), koalas save their environment from water-hoarding developers (Block Koala), an evil magician's animals revolt (Elfazar‚Äôs Hat), a guy fights death through the power of his will (Rakshasa), nature awakens to torment a dangerous car driver (Seaside Drive), a plane with a camera lifts off to explore the galaxy (Caramel Caramel), an intrepid lizard realizes its destiny (Camouflage). Also a witch tries to stop a goth from collecting slime (Magic Garden). I'm honestly not sure how that one fits in.

Another consequence of Pongo's imaginative power, unfortunately, is bringing the dimwitted microscopic Mol Doks to life. When these Mol Doks are consumed in tea, there are gruesome consequences, as a visitor to one of Amy's parties learns (Night Manor). This same tea is later exploited by the mayor to cause a zombie outbreak in Bogtown, though some teens including Amy fight back (Fist Hell).

Around this time, an alien known as the Pilot of the Campanella makes landfall on Earth. He visits Amy's party as well as the streets of Bogtown. And then he returns to space for more adventures.

Some of these adventures include crash landing on Zoldath (Planet Zoldath), flying around drinking coffee (Campanella), participating in races (The Big Bell Race), getting lost on a space station (Campanella 2), crash landing on Zoldath again (Pilot Quest), and flying around shooting things (Campanella 3). Pilot's recurring nemesis is a dinosaur, most likely a descendant of the Earth Emperors of old.

Pilot also introduces us to the wider world of the galaxy. Here, cyborgs play golf (Pingolf), aliens fight for glory (Hyper Contender), people make sacrifices to revolt against their corrupt leaders (Mortol, Mortol II), and tanks go upside down (Warptank). Pongo's power is fainter here in the wider world, but incomprehensible beings like them influence events in each of these scenarios in much the same way. And the echoes of their direct influence remain. When a blue flower promises immortality, it is sought by red bugs (Star Waspir). Robot soldiers go haywire for mysterious reasons (Vainger)‚Ä¶ could this be the Mol Doks at work again?

In any case, at least some Mol Doks from Earth definitely stowed away on the Campanella. They eventually evolve to become human-size, and do useful work like onion delivery (Onion Delivery). They understand (as does Onion Delivery director Chiffon Bola) that in order to play hard, you have to work hard.

Also working hard, albeit through violence, are the resourceful bounty hunters of the galaxy like Pilot's sister Isabell (Bug Hunter), as well as the space pirates. Among these space pirates is Alpha, who becomes trapped on a prison planet (Velgress). After escaping, Alpha must make money through gladiatorial combat (Overbold) and even unscrupulous gambling against the likes of Pilots and even Mol Doks (Quibble Race)! Eventually, she saves up enough to buy a new ship. Where will she go next? We'll have to wait for the next game to find out‚Ä¶ (But I assume it will have something to do with how Amy stowed away on the Campanella and has become a spacefarer and she and Alpha are girlfriends now.)

Back on Earth, sometime in the future, the influence of Pongo has spread, and they no longer value balance as they once did. Animal people are everywhere. Nuclear weapons are being stockpiled. It's sort of ridiculous (Cyber Owls). The human imagination will never be free from the idea of power and violence. And so this scenario can only end one way ‚Äì with the destruction of human civilization.

After the war, it is the birds who survive to rebuild. But Pongo is still here, and their presence amplifies the violent intent of the long-gone dinosaur Emperors, who should have been left forgotten in the dust of history. The Emperors are worshipped as gods by the birds, provoking them to don red and blue once more and continue the legacy of war (Avianos).

Can this cycle ever end? These 50 UFO Soft games present some ways out. You could free yourself from violence by losing yourself in the dream world of eggs. You could prioritize play and games above all else. You could lose yourself in nostalgia for a better past, like the doomed people of El Pasaje. You could simply let the oceans rise up, as they do again and again in these games. But all of these forms of inaction allow violence to persist. Even the unworldly muted colors of the dream world include shades of red and blue. Maybe the only true way out is to reject Pongo's realm for a time, put down the games, and focus on that which is material.

Well! What a perfectly interconnected story, and surely fully intentional. Only a true visionary like Tao Nemuru could have pulled this off!",10,1733613231.0,ufo50,1,0.92,False

1h94w85,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingRace/comments/1h94w85/s1e4_wholesomeness_and_stupidity/,S1E4 ... wholesomeness and stupidity,"On this episode, for people who don't remember (though somehow it seems like most of you do, since y'all have an encyclopedic knowledge about this show), teams had to make their way from Southern France to Tunisia.

Phil says ""We've told teams to find the man in this photo, but we haven't told them which country he's in."" I thought 'ooohh, that's a juicy challenge'. Then he says ""The only clue is this flag"" and they pull out the flag of Tunisia, which I immediately identified correctly. So... you DID tell them which country he's in. It's on the teams if they don't know world flags!

I got a bit judgemental here. As a kid, I used to love world flags and geography. I can't say I know them ALL, but I reckon I could correctly identify about 60% of world flags. So I was utterly astounded at how many teams got confused by this flag. But I get it. Why would the average American need to know the flag of Tunisia? But are people really not that fascinated by flags? I found it a bit sad.

Anyway, it didn't hinder anyone because they all managed to get on the correct ferry. There was some drama as Team Guido kindly booked everyone's tickets and got them a group discount... They did a nice thing! And yet people still hate them. One of Rob or Brennan (or Declan, as I may continue to call him) said ""They came on the show to show that gay men are stand up members of the community, but they still act shady and stab you in the back"". Like, jeez, so they're not allowed to play dirty like you because they're gay? I saw you literally tell the cab driver not to call a cab for Frank and Margarita. That's just rude. Anyway, I hope it's not homophobia, and just the fact that Bill and Joe have been a bit hoity-toity and superior, and also hoodwinking people, but it seems they might have lost too much goodwill to get it back by booking the tickets.

Once teams got to Tunis, they were rushing through the streets to get to the guy, who showed them the detour. I definitely would have gone for the massage option because it was clear where to go AND  you get a massage. But it seems like the coffee shop was actually the correct choice because they were able to ask locals who knew the bazaar intimately. So what do I know? It was funny to see Amie FINALLY smile as she got a nice massage while Paul got twisted to oblivion by his masseur.

Speaking of Paul and Amie, earlier in the episode he complained to the cameraman ""I didn't even want to come on this show, she did! And she's crying every day, which is so exhausting."" It's quite astounding to see this level of honesty from a 2024 perspective. Reality show contestants are now much more savvy about what they say on camera and tend to say things more vague. You would think Paul *wouldn't* bitch about his wife so explicitly ON CAMERA, but here we are. I loved the drama.

There was a choice to go via taxi or train to El Jem, and most contestants chose the taxi, except for Lenny/Karyn (who is living up to her name, btw, always friggin complaining) and Rob/Declan who were surprisingly quite far behind for once. Phil's announcement said the El Jem coliseum was 200 miles south of Tunis, but once again I checked, and it's more like 200km or 120 miles. Why does he keep getting this stuff wrong? Is it not easy to fact check a distance?

I was absolutely loving Dave and Margaretta the grandparents this episode and found their attitude and can-do attitude so wholesome... until they started trying to pay for their taxi in dollars. It was a naive and EXTREMELY American thing to simply believe they could just pay for anything in dollars, and I'm glad the taxi drivers pushed back on that. This mishap cost them a lot of time and eventually the race. It didn't help that Dave started by going anti-clockwise around the coliseum when the direction told him to go clockwise (something I shouted as soon as he started doing it). There was no final word from the losing team this episode, which was a great shame.

The coliseum roadblock seemed pretty easy, although Lenny (I think?) took his life into his hands by climbing over the fence to grab his dangling sword. Everyone else used the long pole.

This episode really made me appreciate how huge of a factor the *travel* was compared to the later seasons (well, I've only seen Season 34) and that the challenges are pretty minimal otherwise. When teams have to make their way to a whole other continent in one episode, (and aren't all being flown around to locations together) it's super exciting.",12,1733613132.0,TheAmazingRace,1,0.81,False

I (M21) went on a date with a girl (F21) I've known for a year and a half, but I wasn‚Äôt in the right mental state to date before (complicated breakup from a first love).

We grabbed a mocha (me) and a hot chocolate (her) together. We got to know each other better‚Äîfamily, career, hobbies, etc.‚Äîduring the date. Personally, I really enjoyed it. She smiled and laughed a lot at my jokes. I‚Äôm usually pretty funny, but I find it hard to make people I like romantically laugh the same way I do with friends. We maintained eye contact quite a bit. The date lasted two hours, which was the time she had planned (she was supposed to meet a friend, but that got canceled, though she still had group work to do‚Äîwe‚Äôre both in business school in France and are French). I walked her home afterward, and then we parted ways.

I sent her a message Friday evening asking if she was doing well and if her group presentations went okay. She replied this morning, saying yes, and asked how I was. I responded that I was doing well and then said: ""I wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed our little coffee/chocolate on Thursday, and I hope you liked it as much as I did. If you‚Äôd like to do it again sometime, let me know!"" To quote myself. This was at 11 a.m.

She replied tonight at midnight with: ""√áa marche üòä"". I‚Äôll struggle to translate this, but it basically means ""I‚Äôm good with that,"" ""that works,"" or ""sure.""

I‚Äôm not sure if her ""√ßa marche"" means ""it works"" in a dismissive way or if it means ""it works"" as in, ""Let‚Äôs go for a second date."" What do you think?

Also, I noticed she was online on Messenger twice today but didn‚Äôt reply right away (12-hour delay). I know she had work today and interacts with her colleagues on Messenger. However, she was also online at 10 p.m. and still didn‚Äôt reply until later. Just to clarify, I‚Äôm not stalking her‚ÄîI also have group work due on Messenger for Monday, but the algorithm keeps showing her as the first person online even though we‚Äôve been chatting on Instagram.

\-------------------

***Three:***

With twilight enveloping the landscape, Christian hastily twisted the key into the front door‚Äôs lock. As he shook the knob to confirm it was sealed, a handgun‚Äôs snout unexpectedly kissed his right temple.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move, don‚Äôt scream.‚Äù* Theo growled from under his ski mask in a voice so gravelly and cartoonish that Charlie needed to suppress a laugh stirring in his throat.

Although Mr. Lutzwater obeyed Theo‚Äôs commands, his austere aura evaporated, crumbling into primal fear. He lowered his voice to a whisper and attempted to negotiate with his captor, stuttering through bouts of hyperventilation.

*‚ÄúYes, yes‚Ä¶let me‚Ä¶let me show you to my veh-vehicle. I have‚Ä¶I have money‚Ä¶I have money there. And of course wi-with me.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúBut we need to go - we need to go now.‚Äù*

Snickering devilishly, Theo denied his request,

*‚ÄúNo, Christian. We want the money inside your suite first. If you don‚Äôt move to open the door in the next few seconds, I‚Äôm going to drive hot lead through your kneecaps, and then we‚Äôll drag you to your suite. Either way, we‚Äôre going in.‚Äù*

As Christian overcame his now full-body tremors enough to unlock the front door, Charlie began preemptively smearing Vaporub through wispy mustache hairs, expecting the embrace of that horrific odor the moment he stepped inside.

If he wasn‚Äôt so focused on the task at hand, he may have noticed the pungent aroma was conspicuously absent as the three men descended into the apartment complex. Or that, somehow, the well that was present in the garden just a week prior had dissolved into nothingness, leaving the surrounding soil present and undisturbed, like it had never been there in the first place.

\------------

With blood and broken teeth landing on the third-floor kitchen tile, Christian at last relented and spoke, unable to withstand another merciless beating.

*‚ÄúThe silver key with the red tip is a skeleton key. It opens all the apartments in the building. The pure gold one is for behind the painting.‚Äù* His tone boggy from the warm puddles of liquid accumulating in his mouth and throat.

*‚ÄúBut please - there is nothing here‚Ä¶nothing here that you want. We need‚Ä¶we need to go‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Charlie passed the keys to Theo, who went to inspect the cubby behind the painting. The older thief continued to monitor Christian, who was bound to a chair in the kitchen.

The first time that Charlie and Theo had interrogated a mark, they were soft and willing to compromise. Years of experience and desensitization, however, had made them inflexible and ruthless. It was for everyone‚Äôs benefit, Charlie rationalized. The faster they cave, the faster the experience can be over for all of them - pulling punches only prolonged the trauma.

*‚ÄúTabitha‚Ä¶Tabitha‚Ä¶oh lord forgive me‚Ä¶‚Äù* Christian muttered to himself, chin to chest, with plasma dripping from the corner of his mouth and on to the collar of his dress shirt.

The older thief had become concerned they may have bludgeoned Mr. Lutzwater a little *too* hard. The man had been spilling eerie nonsense from his lips since Theo‚Äôs knuckles met his skull. It was profoundly disconcerting, witnessing the battered mark plead to some unseen woman. Adding more wax beneath his nostrils, Charlie wished they‚Äôd had remembered duct tape. Something to silence his ominous caterwauling so they could work in peace.

*‚ÄúCharlie, come take a look at this,‚Äù* Theo shouted from the living room.

Frustrated, he left Christian to his ramblings and walked towards the sound of Theo‚Äôs voice, chastising his helplessness: *‚ÄúIf the key he said isn‚Äôt working on the safe, just start tryin‚Äô some of the other‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The ongoing criticism suffocated in Charlie‚Äôs windpipe when he saw what was behind the painting.

It was a circular hole, about the size of a manhole cover, and seething with darkness. A barred, steel gate separated the cavity inside the wall from the apartment, which was tilted outwards toward Theo, who had unlocked it and left it ajar using the gold key.

Charlie stumbled back, battered by the dreadful stench emanating from the aperture. The odor was an appalling mixture of algae, rusted metal, and sulfur, and it lingered almost palpably in the air like vaporized molasses. Even Theo, with his chronically impaired sense of smell, felt himself involuntarily stepping backwards from the deathly aroma.

From the other room, Christian‚Äôs pleading amplified in synchrony with the odor‚Äôs diffusion through the apartment. He howled for Tabitha to forgive him, and to forgive the intruders. He cried out, proclaiming that we were all about to leave and that she should stay where she was.

Charlie found himself paralyzed, swaying in place while his mind fought to comprehend their present circumstances. Theo, born without Charlie‚Äôs common sense, indifferently walked forward through the noxious vapors and placed his entire head and right arm in the hole, illuminating the space with a flashlight from his tool belt.

From inside the cavity, his words were muffled but audible: ‚Äú*Other than smelling like garbage fire, there‚Äôs nothing in here, Charlie. Goddamn, the space goes on for a while. I can‚Äôt really even tell where it ends.‚Äù*

As he yanked his upper body from the crevice, Theo misjudged his position and accidentally slammed the rear of his head against the edge of the black window. After a few twists and *‚Äúgoddamnits‚Äù,* he was free, but he was enraged. Now a bull seeing red on account of the throbbing pain, Theo angrily strode past Charlie and back into the kitchen. Without warning, he smashed the flashlight against Christian‚Äôs jaw with such force that the plexiglass protecting the lightbulb shattered.

*‚ÄúWhere the fuck is the money, dickhead?‚Äù* he shouted, livid from confusion.

Between the simmering panic and the accumulating injuries, Christian had become unresponsive. Unfortunately, this only served to further provoke the young thief. With another overhead arc of his flashlight, Charlie snapped into motion, grabbing Theo‚Äôs arm before he could bring it down on Christian again.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to kill him if you keep going. He said the silver key can open all the empty apartments, yeah? Let‚Äôs go check a few out. If there‚Äôs nothing in them, this may be a wash,‚Äù*

Charlie‚Äôs hushed tone soothed him, and Theo cooled. Within seconds, his anger was replaced with an intense embarrassment that his partner had witnessed such a volcanic outburst. The young thief had always hated his volatility, which caused him, in turn, to idolize Charlie‚Äôs temperament and control.

Theo tapped his boot rapidly against the floor. Over the time it took for him to exhale three deep breaths, he incrementally slowed the rate of the tapping, letting his foot become motionless at the end of the third exhale. This calming technique was something Charlie had taught him years before. His initial skepticism caused him to dismiss Charlie‚Äôs advice. Upon trying it, however, Theo discovered that it worked like a charm - some emotional magic that he was somehow never given access to.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶sorry Ch-‚Ä¶, man. Stay put, asshole.‚Äù* Theo mumbled, almost divulging Charlie‚Äôs identity. He dropped the now broken flashlight at their feet with a calamitous thud. Charlie watched Christian as he did, whose head was laying limply to his right side. He didn‚Äôt flinch, so the thieves assumed he had been knocked out cold.

As their footfalls grew faint, Christian‚Äôs eyes shot open. Satisfied with his convincing theatrics, he began to teeter the wooden chair quietly, using the tips of his feet to slowly gain momentum despite the restraints.

He prayed that the crash would free enough of him to operate the shotgun still hidden in the bedroom.

\------------

Darkness had fallen by the time the thieves exited the main suite and started down the hall toward room 302.

Lutzwater Heights‚Äô was almost completely without electricity, excluding the suite that Christian visited daily. It was a cost saving measure, given that the building had no overnight tenets. They had used sparse natural lighting to usher Christian through the lobby and up the stairwells at first, but the arrival of a moonless night meant that was no longer a viable workaround to navigating the black, powerless labyrinth. Theo‚Äôs violent tantrum had also broken their only *real* flashlight, so the thieves were reduced to Theo phone‚Äôs dim flashlight for guidance.

Shepherded by the faint glow of Theo‚Äôs device, the men tiptoed down the hallway towards the next closest apartment. They didn‚Äôt know exactly *why* they were attempting to move silently - Theo had confirmed ahead of time that the building had no additional security or residents, so there should have been no one to hide from. Yet, it still felt unacceptably dangerous to stomp around Lutzwater Heights in the dead of night.

In a moment of voluminous silence, Charlie could swear he heard something skittering closer to them from behind. The noise was familiar - it was the same frenetic tapping he heard when he tossed his change down the strange well a week earlier. Immediately panicked, he used Theo‚Äôs wrist as a handle to turn the direction of the light one-hundred and eighty degrees. When he did, however, they saw nothing but the empty hallway that led back to Christian‚Äôs suite.

*‚ÄúWhat are you doing, psycho?‚Äù* Theo snapped, wrenching his hand away from Charlie‚Äôs grip.

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶hear that? The tapping?‚Äù* Charlie whispered, swiveling his head from side-to-side to identify the best possible angle for isolating the true origin of the noise, which now seemed to be spinning and twisting around him.

Theo heard the skittering, but he had been choosing to ignore it. Masking his own growing terror with a familiar bravado, he rebuked Charlie and continued to move forward.

*‚ÄúJesus man, get a grip. It‚Äôs probably just drizzling outside. Don‚Äôt have a coronary over some fucking rain.‚Äù*

Room 302 was just a short distance away from Theo. As he walked forward and he pivoted the knob, Charlie felt an uncontrollable twinge of fear sprint up and down his spine, but his only friend had already proceeded into the blackness before he could overcome that fear and stop him.

Reluctantly, he forced himself through the threshold after the young thief.

In a fevered rush of bravery, Charlie almost trampled Theo, who was just inside the room and fiddling with a dusty light switch. Despite a bevy of attempts, no electricity appeared to brighten the room and expunge the darkness as he flicked the loose plastic knub up and down.

*‚ÄúUgh, figures. Guess he wasn‚Äôt lying about the power.‚Äù* Theo declared impatiently, desperate for this experience to be over, but unwilling to admit defeat and leave without some financial reparations for their time. He stepped forward, momentarily illuminating something so grotesque and unexpected that it caused the phone to drop from Theo‚Äôs grip. It clattered to the floor, flashlight side-up, sliding just a little bit further into the tomb. When the phone stopped moving, it laid directly under the impossible anomaly, dramatically saturating it with light from below.

Multiple large, fleshy tubes ran the length of the otherwise empty living quarters. They were all approximately three feet in diameter, covered in sickly white skin that was adorned with hundreds of circumferential ridges, giving them the appearance of an unnaturally gigantic colon or earthworm. Each living cylinder came in and out of the room through different holes in the apartment‚Äôs four walls, occurring haphazardly at various positions and heights. The tunnels had jagged edges, because unlike the circular cavity tucked away behind the painting in Christian‚Äôs room, someone had not installed them meaningfully. Instead, something created them with physical force.

Because there was no forethought put into the holes design, the tubes ended up forming a tangled and overlapping mess - a ball of heavy, intertwining fingers. Though Theo and Charlie only saw about eight distinct tubes from their stunned vantage point, the real total occupying apartment 302 was roughly three times greater. Only an arm‚Äôs length from the writhing mass, the thieves watched as it gurgled and twisted with hideous, synchronous movement.

As the tubes squirmed, mists of the infernal aroma were expelled from their pores. The stench and the shock caused Charlie to fall back against the entryway and vomit, unintentionally closing the door and sealing the chamber.

Theo, although petrified by the hallucinatory creature, stooped and extended a shaking hand to get his phone. Only a foot from him, the device was inches below a tube that entered the living room‚Äôs top-left corner and slowly sagged downwards to another tunnel deeper within. Nearly on his knees, Theo contorted himself carefully to avoid letting his upper body make contact with another tube that hung higher and closer to the door. Through heavy breathing, the palm of his hand arrived at the phone, which covered the flashlight and plunged the room into a lightless void.

At that exact moment, Christian had finally managed to tip the wooden chair over, resulting in a loud, splintering crash. The distant noise caused a hypervigilant Theo to involuntarily stand and pivot his body to the left, moving to assess another potential threat by looking in the direction of the sound.

A wet slap resonated through the room. Theo‚Äôs cheek and forehead had collided with one of the writhing tubes when he stood, and the sensation startled him, causing the young thief to once again drop his phone. As the apparatus left his hand, the gleam of its flashlight reappeared to put a spotlight on Theo, forcing Charlie to bear witness to the hellish spectacle that followed.

The pallid skin of the tube trilled, resulting in a seismic ripple of tiny, pointed waves to appear around Theo‚Äôs head like a halo. No taller than a centimeter, thousands of alabaster spikes radiated in a circle from the point of contact, like the way a thrown pebble can send shockwaves over the surface of a previously still lake. As Theo tried to withdraw his forehead, a slab of vibrating flesh the size and shape of an oven mitt erupted outward from a part of the tube located directly above him. The awakened flesh perched in the air for a split-second - a wriggling, amorphous tombstone for the young thief.

Charlie followed the scene hypnotically, convinced he had taken a wrong turn somewhere and entered a daydream. It was almost like the tube wasn‚Äôt actually solid; he reflected indifferently. It was more a congealed liquid that had settled on structuring itself in a tube shape, for one reason or another. The creation of the fleshy tendril didn‚Äôt seem to damage the tube‚Äôs contents, as it should have if the tissue were solid, and more silvery skin quickly filled the space the tendril had occupied before it came to life.

In one swift motion, thousands of tiny, wriggling barbs sprouted from the side of the fleshy tombstone that faced Theo, only to come crashing down on his unprotected forehead and scalp.

Theo discharged an unearthly cacophony from his lungs. An impossibly concentrated terror made dissonant music through his fraying vocal cords, resulting in a scream so disconcertingly primal that it caused Charlie to kick his heels back against the floor, pushing himself into the fetal position in the room's corner. Steaming blood dripped down Theo‚Äôs face like melting candle wax, staining his visible skin a deep crimson.

From in front of Theo, another tube audibly shifted. The congealed skin appeared to be running its most superficial layer counterclockwise, like the tube was a sausage and the casing of it was whizzing around an unseen axis. A recognizable three slits slid into Charlie‚Äôs peripheral vision. The tube‚Äôs shifting slowed and stopped once the slits were parallel to Theo. They seemed to observe his distress indifferently, like someone who found a creature squealing under the harsh steel of a mousetrap in their cellar. It was trying to determine exactly what it had caught.

A moment later, Christian‚Äôs foot collided violently with 302‚Äôs door. He strode into the commotion with a confidence that showcased that he was relatively unphased by the horror before him. He remained handcuffed to a piece of the shattered wooden chair from the other room, dragging it with him as he walked. Christian beckoned to Charlie with the barrel of a shotgun, wordlessly imploring him to leave the room under his protection. The older thief frantically crawled on all fours in Christian‚Äôs direction, sprawling on his back and wailing once he had reached the safety of the unlit hallway.

Then, from the depths of 302, a blast rung out. The explosion permanently quieted Theo‚Äôs agony, leaving only the melody of Charlie‚Äôs sobs echoing through the apartment complex.

Dress shoes clicked towards Charlie, slow and deliberate. In a reversal of position, the snout of Christian‚Äôs still fuming shotgun pressed lightly against Charlie‚Äôs forehead.

From above him, Mr. Lutzwater dropped Theo‚Äôs phone next to his ear, still sticky and hot with viscous blood.

The flashlight remained on and functional despite the death of its owner, and the plasma now coating the lens had tinted the faint glimmer pink.

*‚ÄúGet up. Show me where you saw the well.‚Äù*

\----------------------------------------------

***Four:***

*Once there was a lonely young boy named Christian.*

*Although his family was staggeringly wealthy, an expansive mansion and a fleet of servants did not quell the young boy‚Äôs loneliness.*

*However, fate would soon intervene on the boy‚Äôs loneliness. A young girl named Tabitha skipped into Christian‚Äôs expansive backyard one day. They were fast friends, enjoying the same games and stories as each other.*

*Christian and Tabitha even kind of looked similar, like long-lost siblings or twins. But the resemblance was not a coincidence - no, this was intentional.*

*Rosemary and Sebastian, Christian‚Äôs parents, had purchased Tabitha from a local drunk. They had shopped around for many years, trying to find a child that looked like their Christian. Thankfully, Tabitha‚Äôs mother was more than happy to turn one of her children into money to purchase more liquor.*

*In a time before Christian‚Äôs birth, Sebastian had struck a deal with something old and infinite. It lived inside a well, whispering softly to a young, destitute Sebastian. It purposed a simple transaction - immense riches, a fix for his poverty, in exchange for the first of his eventual bloodline.*

*The young man agreed to the terms.*

*Thus, Sebastian was an overnight success in the world of real estate. And for a long while, things were prosperous and peaceful. Sebastian was not worried, either. If that thing in the well ever came back and asked for their end of the deal, he had a plan to circumvent the surrender of his firstborn.*

*Two years after Sebastian purchased Tabitha, he saw a familiar-looking well appear in the backyard, right around Christian‚Äôs eighth birthday.*

*Although it pained him, he enacted his plan that very night.*

*Quietly, as to not wake Christian, Sebastian and Rosemary rose Tabitha. As quickly as they could, they shaved her head to match Christian‚Äôs. Then, they dressed her in Christian‚Äôs clothes. Finally, they had their most trusted servant throw her down the well.*

*When Rosemary and Sebastian could no longer see the well or hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, they assumed their debt had been paid - their surrogate first-born accepted by the thing that lived in the well.*

*But Christian could still see the well. Christian could still hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, all day and all night. Overtime, the pitch of her voice became lower and lower. The cries of pain transitioned into screams of anger. And one night, Christian was summoned to his bedroom window by a skittering, tapping sound coming from the well.*

*Horrified, he watched as a massive worm emerged from the well, ascending the stone wall on thousands of legs that seemed to vanish and reappear as it climbed. It almost could not drag itself out of the hatch, its diameter being a near-perfect mold of the inside of the well, causing it to fit very snugly.*

*The end that first appeared from the well was flat and blunted, decorated with three, rippling slits - two vertical, one horizontal. In the beginning, it was no longer than a broomstick. But as it dragged more and more of the servants into the well at night, its size grew.*

*Christian could have warned his parents, but he knew the worm was Tabitha, and he wanted to protect her more than he wanted to save them. She skittered up the wall to his second-story bedroom, and he let her inside via the window. The details of the betrayal and the pain Tabitha had gone through convinced Christian to keep her transformation a secret.*

*He was sixteen when Tabitha finally pulled Sebastian and Rosemary into the well, crying out for Christian to help them. But at that point, Tabitha was almost a half mile long, living tangled up in the walls of the mansion. He couldn‚Äôt have helped them, even if he wanted to.*

*When Tabitha finally got too big for the house, she retreated into the sewers at Christian‚Äôs behest.*

*He promised he had found a new home for her, on the opposite side of the city.* 

*Christian would meet her there.*

\------------

At gunpoint, Christian forced Charlie to the front of Lutzwater Heights, guided by the dim light of Theo‚Äôs phone. During the short journey, Mr. Lutzwater bombarded his captive with an array of unintelligible ramblings. Christian never had anyone to talk to about Tabitha. So, when he had Charlie as his unwilling confident, someone who had seen Tabitha and lived, he simply couldn‚Äôt help himself. The floodgates broke, and years of pent-up madness spilled through.

*‚ÄúShe wants to leave and live in the sewers, but I won‚Äôt let her,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI had to evacuate the building - she was getting too big to only live in the walls, she needed to start living in the apartments, too,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe well still wants me - that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so hungry all the time. But I feed her, and she would never hurt me, no matter how hungry she got,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúTabitha gets hungrier at night - I told you we shouldn‚Äôt have gone in,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about this, but Tabitha is still hungry.‚Äù*

Outside Lutzwater Heights, by the well, Charlie desperately begged Christian to let him return home. But Mr. Lutzwater couldn‚Äôt hear anything he had to say over the deafening noise of his jagged, incomprehensible monologue.

As Charlie approached the well, shotgun to his back, Tabitha rose from the inky darkness. He shouted for help, but no one else was around the empty boluvard.

Before Charlie could make a break for it, she caught his leg and twisted around him like a boa constrictor. The pale flesh squished against his body. He braced himself to be devoured like Theo, but he remained intact as Tabitha coiled around him. The barbs, her teeth, had not yet rematerialized.

From his immobilized position, Charlie saw another piece of Tabitha silently slither out the front door. Christian‚Äôs endless monologue continued, even though Charlie could not hear a single word of it over the droning and churning of Tabitha‚Äôs liquid flesh.

Mr. Lutzwater never saw it coming.

Tabitha‚Äôs barbs dug into his right ankle and calf, causing an immediate and ear-splitting scream from Christian that only Charlie was around to hear. The congealed flesh then flipped him upside down, causing his head to slam violently into the hard earth, knocking him unconscious.

The thick tendril then hoisted him into the air, moving Christian directly over the well‚Äôs maw. As it did, the tentacle that was holding Charlie in place uncoiled and receded into the well, disappearing from view.

A voice then echoed from inside the well, deep and unfamiliar.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget about our deal, Charlie. This is what happens when you don‚Äôt abide by the terms.‚Äù*

And with that, the tentacle holding Christian released its grasp, causing him to fall noiselessly into the shadows. Shortly afterwards, that tentacle followed Christian in. For the next few hours, Charlie sat upright on the ground and wordlessly watched miles of Tabitha slither from the entrance of Lutzwater Heights into the well. As the sun rose, the last of her squeezed itself into the hatch. Once it did, Charlie could see the well no longer.

\------------

Two months later, Charlie had his first date with Hilda. She owned a coffee shop next door to where he had been getting therapy. Charlie never divulged to anyone what he saw happen that night - only admitting that he had a close friend pass away in front of him, never willing to divest additional details.

Hilda immediately fell for Charlie, despite his overwhelmingly colorless demeanor following Theo‚Äôs death. He was skeptical at first, but then Charlie recalled the terms of his deal.

Sometimes, he thinks he sees the well. In public and in private, lurking on the very edge of his peripheral vision. He frequently steels his conscious and compartmentalizes his emotions, not wanting to become too attached to the idea of Charlie Junior, despite Hilda being pregnant with their firstborn.

In the end, Charlie wasn‚Äôt exactly happy, but he certainly was not alone.

***Three:***

With twilight enveloping the landscape, Christian hastily twisted the key into the front door‚Äôs lock. As he shook the knob to confirm it was sealed, a handgun‚Äôs snout unexpectedly kissed his right temple.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move, don‚Äôt scream.‚Äù* Theo growled from under his ski mask in a voice so gravelly and cartoonish that Charlie needed to suppress a laugh stirring in his throat.

Although Mr. Lutzwater obeyed Theo‚Äôs commands, his austere aura evaporated, crumbling into primal fear. He lowered his voice to a whisper and attempted to negotiate with his captor, stuttering through bouts of hyperventilation.

*‚ÄúYes, yes‚Ä¶let me‚Ä¶let me show you to my veh-vehicle. I have‚Ä¶I have money‚Ä¶I have money there. And of course wi-with me.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúBut we need to go - we need to go now.‚Äù*

Snickering devilishly, Theo denied his request,

*‚ÄúNo, Christian. We want the money inside your suite first. If you don‚Äôt move to open the door in the next few seconds, I‚Äôm going to drive hot lead through your kneecaps, and then we‚Äôll drag you to your suite. Either way, we‚Äôre going in.‚Äù*

As Christian overcame his now full-body tremors enough to unlock the front door, Charlie began preemptively smearing Vaporub through wispy mustache hairs, expecting the embrace of that horrific odor the moment he stepped inside.

If he wasn‚Äôt so focused on the task at hand, he may have noticed the pungent aroma was conspicuously absent as the three men descended into the apartment complex. Or that, somehow, the well that was present in the garden just a week prior had dissolved into nothingness, leaving the surrounding soil present and undisturbed, like it had never been there in the first place.

\------------

With blood and broken teeth landing on the third-floor kitchen tile, Christian at last relented and spoke, unable to withstand another merciless beating.

*‚ÄúThe silver key with the red tip is a skeleton key. It opens all the apartments in the building. The pure gold one is for behind the painting.‚Äù* His tone boggy from the warm puddles of liquid accumulating in his mouth and throat.

*‚ÄúBut please - there is nothing here‚Ä¶nothing here that you want. We need‚Ä¶we need to go‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Charlie passed the keys to Theo, who went to inspect the cubby behind the painting. The older thief continued to monitor Christian, who was bound to a chair in the kitchen.

The first time that Charlie and Theo had interrogated a mark, they were soft and willing to compromise. Years of experience and desensitization, however, had made them inflexible and ruthless. It was for everyone‚Äôs benefit, Charlie rationalized. The faster they cave, the faster the experience can be over for all of them - pulling punches only prolonged the trauma.

*‚ÄúTabitha‚Ä¶Tabitha‚Ä¶oh lord forgive me‚Ä¶‚Äù* Christian muttered to himself, chin to chest, with plasma dripping from the corner of his mouth and on to the collar of his dress shirt.

The older thief had become concerned they may have bludgeoned Mr. Lutzwater a little *too* hard. The man had been spilling eerie nonsense from his lips since Theo‚Äôs knuckles met his skull. It was profoundly disconcerting, witnessing the battered mark plead to some unseen woman. Adding more wax beneath his nostrils, Charlie wished they‚Äôd had remembered duct tape. Something to silence his ominous caterwauling so they could work in peace.

*‚ÄúCharlie, come take a look at this,‚Äù* Theo shouted from the living room.

Frustrated, he left Christian to his ramblings and walked towards the sound of Theo‚Äôs voice, chastising his helplessness: *‚ÄúIf the key he said isn‚Äôt working on the safe, just start tryin‚Äô some of the other‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The ongoing criticism suffocated in Charlie‚Äôs windpipe when he saw what was behind the painting.

It was a circular hole, about the size of a manhole cover, and seething with darkness. A barred, steel gate separated the cavity inside the wall from the apartment, which was tilted outwards toward Theo, who had unlocked it and left it ajar using the gold key.

Charlie stumbled back, battered by the dreadful stench emanating from the aperture. The odor was an appalling mixture of algae, rusted metal, and sulfur, and it lingered almost palpably in the air like vaporized molasses. Even Theo, with his chronically impaired sense of smell, felt himself involuntarily stepping backwards from the deathly aroma.

From the other room, Christian‚Äôs pleading amplified in synchrony with the odor‚Äôs diffusion through the apartment. He howled for Tabitha to forgive him, and to forgive the intruders. He cried out, proclaiming that we were all about to leave and that she should stay where she was.

Charlie found himself paralyzed, swaying in place while his mind fought to comprehend their present circumstances. Theo, born without Charlie‚Äôs common sense, indifferently walked forward through the noxious vapors and placed his entire head and right arm in the hole, illuminating the space with a flashlight from his tool belt.

From inside the cavity, his words were muffled but audible: ‚Äú*Other than smelling like garbage fire, there‚Äôs nothing in here, Charlie. Goddamn, the space goes on for a while. I can‚Äôt really even tell where it ends.‚Äù*

As he yanked his upper body from the crevice, Theo misjudged his position and accidentally slammed the rear of his head against the edge of the black window. After a few twists and *‚Äúgoddamnits‚Äù,* he was free, but he was enraged. Now a bull seeing red on account of the throbbing pain, Theo angrily strode past Charlie and back into the kitchen. Without warning, he smashed the flashlight against Christian‚Äôs jaw with such force that the plexiglass protecting the lightbulb shattered.

*‚ÄúWhere the fuck is the money, dickhead?‚Äù* he shouted, livid from confusion.

Between the simmering panic and the accumulating injuries, Christian had become unresponsive. Unfortunately, this only served to further provoke the young thief. With another overhead arc of his flashlight, Charlie snapped into motion, grabbing Theo‚Äôs arm before he could bring it down on Christian again.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to kill him if you keep going. He said the silver key can open all the empty apartments, yeah? Let‚Äôs go check a few out. If there‚Äôs nothing in them, this may be a wash,‚Äù*

Charlie‚Äôs hushed tone soothed him, and Theo cooled. Within seconds, his anger was replaced with an intense embarrassment that his partner had witnessed such a volcanic outburst. The young thief had always hated his volatility, which caused him, in turn, to idolize Charlie‚Äôs temperament and control.

Theo tapped his boot rapidly against the floor. Over the time it took for him to exhale three deep breaths, he incrementally slowed the rate of the tapping, letting his foot become motionless at the end of the third exhale. This calming technique was something Charlie had taught him years before. His initial skepticism caused him to dismiss Charlie‚Äôs advice. Upon trying it, however, Theo discovered that it worked like a charm - some emotional magic that he was somehow never given access to.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶sorry Ch-‚Ä¶, man. Stay put, asshole.‚Äù* Theo mumbled, almost divulging Charlie‚Äôs identity. He dropped the now broken flashlight at their feet with a calamitous thud. Charlie watched Christian as he did, whose head was laying limply to his right side. He didn‚Äôt flinch, so the thieves assumed he had been knocked out cold.

As their footfalls grew faint, Christian‚Äôs eyes shot open. Satisfied with his convincing theatrics, he began to teeter the wooden chair quietly, using the tips of his feet to slowly gain momentum despite the restraints.

He prayed that the crash would free enough of him to operate the shotgun still hidden in the bedroom.

\------------

Darkness had fallen by the time the thieves exited the main suite and started down the hall toward room 302.

Lutzwater Heights‚Äô was almost completely without electricity, excluding the suite that Christian visited daily. It was a cost saving measure, given that the building had no overnight tenets. They had used sparse natural lighting to usher Christian through the lobby and up the stairwells at first, but the arrival of a moonless night meant that was no longer a viable workaround to navigating the black, powerless labyrinth. Theo‚Äôs violent tantrum had also broken their only *real* flashlight, so the thieves were reduced to Theo phone‚Äôs dim flashlight for guidance.

Shepherded by the faint glow of Theo‚Äôs device, the men tiptoed down the hallway towards the next closest apartment. They didn‚Äôt know exactly *why* they were attempting to move silently - Theo had confirmed ahead of time that the building had no additional security or residents, so there should have been no one to hide from. Yet, it still felt unacceptably dangerous to stomp around Lutzwater Heights in the dead of night.

In a moment of voluminous silence, Charlie could swear he heard something skittering closer to them from behind. The noise was familiar - it was the same frenetic tapping he heard when he tossed his change down the strange well a week earlier. Immediately panicked, he used Theo‚Äôs wrist as a handle to turn the direction of the light one-hundred and eighty degrees. When he did, however, they saw nothing but the empty hallway that led back to Christian‚Äôs suite.

*‚ÄúWhat are you doing, psycho?‚Äù* Theo snapped, wrenching his hand away from Charlie‚Äôs grip.

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶hear that? The tapping?‚Äù* Charlie whispered, swiveling his head from side-to-side to identify the best possible angle for isolating the true origin of the noise, which now seemed to be spinning and twisting around him.

Theo heard the skittering, but he had been choosing to ignore it. Masking his own growing terror with a familiar bravado, he rebuked Charlie and continued to move forward.

*‚ÄúJesus man, get a grip. It‚Äôs probably just drizzling outside. Don‚Äôt have a coronary over some fucking rain.‚Äù*

Room 302 was just a short distance away from Theo. As he walked forward and he pivoted the knob, Charlie felt an uncontrollable twinge of fear sprint up and down his spine, but his only friend had already proceeded into the blackness before he could overcome that fear and stop him.

Reluctantly, he forced himself through the threshold after the young thief.

In a fevered rush of bravery, Charlie almost trampled Theo, who was just inside the room and fiddling with a dusty light switch. Despite a bevy of attempts, no electricity appeared to brighten the room and expunge the darkness as he flicked the loose plastic knub up and down.

*‚ÄúUgh, figures. Guess he wasn‚Äôt lying about the power.‚Äù* Theo declared impatiently, desperate for this experience to be over, but unwilling to admit defeat and leave without some financial reparations for their time. He stepped forward, momentarily illuminating something so grotesque and unexpected that it caused the phone to drop from Theo‚Äôs grip. It clattered to the floor, flashlight side-up, sliding just a little bit further into the tomb. When the phone stopped moving, it laid directly under the impossible anomaly, dramatically saturating it with light from below.

Multiple large, fleshy tubes ran the length of the otherwise empty living quarters. They were all approximately three feet in diameter, covered in sickly white skin that was adorned with hundreds of circumferential ridges, giving them the appearance of an unnaturally gigantic colon or earthworm. Each living cylinder came in and out of the room through different holes in the apartment‚Äôs four walls, occurring haphazardly at various positions and heights. The tunnels had jagged edges, because unlike the circular cavity tucked away behind the painting in Christian‚Äôs room, someone had not installed them meaningfully. Instead, something created them with physical force.

Because there was no forethought put into the holes design, the tubes ended up forming a tangled and overlapping mess - a ball of heavy, intertwining fingers. Though Theo and Charlie only saw about eight distinct tubes from their stunned vantage point, the real total occupying apartment 302 was roughly three times greater. Only an arm‚Äôs length from the writhing mass, the thieves watched as it gurgled and twisted with hideous, synchronous movement.

As the tubes squirmed, mists of the infernal aroma were expelled from their pores. The stench and the shock caused Charlie to fall back against the entryway and vomit, unintentionally closing the door and sealing the chamber.

Theo, although petrified by the hallucinatory creature, stooped and extended a shaking hand to get his phone. Only a foot from him, the device was inches below a tube that entered the living room‚Äôs top-left corner and slowly sagged downwards to another tunnel deeper within. Nearly on his knees, Theo contorted himself carefully to avoid letting his upper body make contact with another tube that hung higher and closer to the door. Through heavy breathing, the palm of his hand arrived at the phone, which covered the flashlight and plunged the room into a lightless void.

At that exact moment, Christian had finally managed to tip the wooden chair over, resulting in a loud, splintering crash. The distant noise caused a hypervigilant Theo to involuntarily stand and pivot his body to the left, moving to assess another potential threat by looking in the direction of the sound.

A wet slap resonated through the room. Theo‚Äôs cheek and forehead had collided with one of the writhing tubes when he stood, and the sensation startled him, causing the young thief to once again drop his phone. As the apparatus left his hand, the gleam of its flashlight reappeared to put a spotlight on Theo, forcing Charlie to bear witness to the hellish spectacle that followed.

The pallid skin of the tube trilled, resulting in a seismic ripple of tiny, pointed waves to appear around Theo‚Äôs head like a halo. No taller than a centimeter, thousands of alabaster spikes radiated in a circle from the point of contact, like the way a thrown pebble can send shockwaves over the surface of a previously still lake. As Theo tried to withdraw his forehead, a slab of vibrating flesh the size and shape of an oven mitt erupted outward from a part of the tube located directly above him. The awakened flesh perched in the air for a split-second - a wriggling, amorphous tombstone for the young thief.

Charlie followed the scene hypnotically, convinced he had taken a wrong turn somewhere and entered a daydream. It was almost like the tube wasn‚Äôt actually solid; he reflected indifferently. It was more a congealed liquid that had settled on structuring itself in a tube shape, for one reason or another. The creation of the fleshy tendril didn‚Äôt seem to damage the tube‚Äôs contents, as it should have if the tissue were solid, and more silvery skin quickly filled the space the tendril had occupied before it came to life.

In one swift motion, thousands of tiny, wriggling barbs sprouted from the side of the fleshy tombstone that faced Theo, only to come crashing down on his unprotected forehead and scalp.

Theo discharged an unearthly cacophony from his lungs. An impossibly concentrated terror made dissonant music through his fraying vocal cords, resulting in a scream so disconcertingly primal that it caused Charlie to kick his heels back against the floor, pushing himself into the fetal position in the room's corner. Steaming blood dripped down Theo‚Äôs face like melting candle wax, staining his visible skin a deep crimson.

From in front of Theo, another tube audibly shifted. The congealed skin appeared to be running its most superficial layer counterclockwise, like the tube was a sausage and the casing of it was whizzing around an unseen axis. A recognizable three slits slid into Charlie‚Äôs peripheral vision. The tube‚Äôs shifting slowed and stopped once the slits were parallel to Theo. They seemed to observe his distress indifferently, like someone who found a creature squealing under the harsh steel of a mousetrap in their cellar. It was trying to determine exactly what it had caught.

A moment later, Christian‚Äôs foot collided violently with 302‚Äôs door. He strode into the commotion with a confidence that showcased that he was relatively unphased by the horror before him. He remained handcuffed to a piece of the shattered wooden chair from the other room, dragging it with him as he walked. Christian beckoned to Charlie with the barrel of a shotgun, wordlessly imploring him to leave the room under his protection. The older thief frantically crawled on all fours in Christian‚Äôs direction, sprawling on his back and wailing once he had reached the safety of the unlit hallway.

Then, from the depths of 302, a blast rung out. The explosion permanently quieted Theo‚Äôs agony, leaving only the melody of Charlie‚Äôs sobs echoing through the apartment complex.

Dress shoes clicked towards Charlie, slow and deliberate. In a reversal of position, the snout of Christian‚Äôs still fuming shotgun pressed lightly against Charlie‚Äôs forehead.

From above him, Mr. Lutzwater dropped Theo‚Äôs phone next to his ear, still sticky and hot with viscous blood.

The flashlight remained on and functional despite the death of its owner, and the plasma now coating the lens had tinted the faint glimmer pink.

*‚ÄúGet up. Show me where you saw the well.‚Äù*

\----------------------------------------------

***Four:***

*Once there was a lonely young boy named Christian.*

*Although his family was staggeringly wealthy, an expansive mansion and a fleet of servants did not quell the young boy‚Äôs loneliness.*

*However, fate would soon intervene on the boy‚Äôs loneliness. A young girl named Tabitha skipped into Christian‚Äôs expansive backyard one day. They were fast friends, enjoying the same games and stories as each other.*

*Christian and Tabitha even kind of looked similar, like long-lost siblings or twins. But the resemblance was not a coincidence - no, this was intentional.*

*Rosemary and Sebastian, Christian‚Äôs parents, had purchased Tabitha from a local drunk. They had shopped around for many years, trying to find a child that looked like their Christian. Thankfully, Tabitha‚Äôs mother was more than happy to turn one of her children into money to purchase more liquor.*

*In a time before Christian‚Äôs birth, Sebastian had struck a deal with something old and infinite. It lived inside a well, whispering softly to a young, destitute Sebastian. It purposed a simple transaction - immense riches, a fix for his poverty, in exchange for the first of his eventual bloodline.*

*The young man agreed to the terms.*

*Thus, Sebastian was an overnight success in the world of real estate. And for a long while, things were prosperous and peaceful. Sebastian was not worried, either. If that thing in the well ever came back and asked for their end of the deal, he had a plan to circumvent the surrender of his firstborn.*

*Two years after Sebastian purchased Tabitha, he saw a familiar-looking well appear in the backyard, right around Christian‚Äôs eighth birthday.*

*Although it pained him, he enacted his plan that very night.*

*Quietly, as to not wake Christian, Sebastian and Rosemary rose Tabitha. As quickly as they could, they shaved her head to match Christian‚Äôs. Then, they dressed her in Christian‚Äôs clothes. Finally, they had their most trusted servant throw her down the well.*

*When Rosemary and Sebastian could no longer see the well or hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, they assumed their debt had been paid - their surrogate first-born accepted by the thing that lived in the well.*

*But Christian could still see the well. Christian could still hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, all day and all night. Overtime, the pitch of her voice became lower and lower. The cries of pain transitioned into screams of anger. And one night, Christian was summoned to his bedroom window by a skittering, tapping sound coming from the well.*

*Horrified, he watched as a massive worm emerged from the well, ascending the stone wall on thousands of legs that seemed to vanish and reappear as it climbed. It almost could not drag itself out of the hatch, its diameter being a near-perfect mold of the inside of the well, causing it to fit very snugly.*

*The end that first appeared from the well was flat and blunted, decorated with three, rippling slits - two vertical, one horizontal. In the beginning, it was no longer than a broomstick. But as it dragged more and more of the servants into the well at night, its size grew.*

*Christian could have warned his parents, but he knew the worm was Tabitha, and he wanted to protect her more than he wanted to save them. She skittered up the wall to his second-story bedroom, and he let her inside via the window. The details of the betrayal and the pain Tabitha had gone through convinced Christian to keep her transformation a secret.*

*He was sixteen when Tabitha finally pulled Sebastian and Rosemary into the well, crying out for Christian to help them. But at that point, Tabitha was almost a half mile long, living tangled up in the walls of the mansion. He couldn‚Äôt have helped them, even if he wanted to.*

*When Tabitha finally got too big for the house, she retreated into the sewers at Christian‚Äôs behest.*

*He promised he had found a new home for her, on the opposite side of the city.* 

*Christian would meet her there.*

\------------

At gunpoint, Christian forced Charlie to the front of Lutzwater Heights, guided by the dim light of Theo‚Äôs phone. During the short journey, Mr. Lutzwater bombarded his captive with an array of unintelligible ramblings. Christian never had anyone to talk to about Tabitha. So, when he had Charlie as his unwilling confident, someone who had seen Tabitha and lived, he simply couldn‚Äôt help himself. The floodgates broke, and years of pent-up madness spilled through.

*‚ÄúThe well still wants me - that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so hungry all the time. But I feed her, and she would never hurt me, no matter how hungry she got,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúTabitha gets hungrier at night - I told you we shouldn‚Äôt have gone in,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about this, but Tabitha is still hungry.‚Äù*

Outside Lutzwater Heights, by the well, Charlie desperately begged Christian to let him return home. But Mr. Lutzwater couldn‚Äôt hear anything he had to say over the deafening noise of his jagged, incomprehensible monologue.

It was a circular hole, about the size of a manhole cover, and seething with darkness. A barred, steel gate separated the cavity inside the wall from the apartment, which was tilted outwards toward Theo, who had unlocked it and left it ajar using the gold key.

Charlie stumbled back, battered by the dreadful stench emanating from the aperture. The odor was an appalling mixture of algae, rusted metal, and sulfur, and it lingered almost palpably in the air like vaporized molasses. Even Theo, with his chronically impaired sense of smell, felt himself involuntarily stepping backwards from the deathly aroma.

From the other room, Christian‚Äôs pleading amplified in synchrony with the odor‚Äôs diffusion through the apartment. He howled for Tabitha to forgive him, and to forgive the intruders. He cried out, proclaiming that we were all about to leave and that she should stay where she was.

Charlie found himself paralyzed, swaying in place while his mind fought to comprehend their present circumstances. Theo, born without Charlie‚Äôs common sense, indifferently walked forward through the noxious vapors and placed his entire head and right arm in the hole, illuminating the space with a flashlight from his tool belt.

From inside the cavity, his words were muffled but audible: ‚Äú*Other than smelling like garbage fire, there‚Äôs nothing in here, Charlie. Goddamn, the space goes on for a while. I can‚Äôt really even tell where it ends.‚Äù*

As he yanked his upper body from the crevice, Theo misjudged his position and accidentally slammed the rear of his head against the edge of the black window. After a few twists and *‚Äúgoddamnits‚Äù,* he was free, but he was enraged. Now a bull seeing red on account of the throbbing pain, Theo angrily strode past Charlie and back into the kitchen. Without warning, he smashed the flashlight against Christian‚Äôs jaw with such force that the plexiglass protecting the lightbulb shattered.

*‚ÄúWhere the fuck is the money, dickhead?‚Äù* he shouted, livid from confusion.

Between the simmering panic and the accumulating injuries, Christian had become unresponsive. Unfortunately, this only served to further provoke the young thief. With another overhead arc of his flashlight, Charlie snapped into motion, grabbing Theo‚Äôs arm before he could bring it down on Christian again.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to kill him if you keep going. He said the silver key can open all the empty apartments, yeah? Let‚Äôs go check a few out. If there‚Äôs nothing in them, this may be a wash,‚Äù*

Charlie‚Äôs hushed tone soothed him, and Theo cooled. Within seconds, his anger was replaced with an intense embarrassment that his partner had witnessed such a volcanic outburst. The young thief had always hated his volatility, which caused him, in turn, to idolize Charlie‚Äôs temperament and control.

Theo tapped his boot rapidly against the floor. Over the time it took for him to exhale three deep breaths, he incrementally slowed the rate of the tapping, letting his foot become motionless at the end of the third exhale. This calming technique was something Charlie had taught him years before. His initial skepticism caused him to dismiss Charlie‚Äôs advice. Upon trying it, however, Theo discovered that it worked like a charm - some emotional magic that he was somehow never given access to.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶sorry Ch-‚Ä¶, man. Stay put, asshole.‚Äù* Theo mumbled, almost divulging Charlie‚Äôs identity. He dropped the now broken flashlight at their feet with a calamitous thud. Charlie watched Christian as he did, whose head was laying limply to his right side. He didn‚Äôt flinch, so the thieves assumed he had been knocked out cold.

As their footfalls grew faint, Christian‚Äôs eyes shot open. Satisfied with his convincing theatrics, he began to teeter the wooden chair quietly, using the tips of his feet to slowly gain momentum despite the restraints.

He prayed that the crash would free enough of him to operate the shotgun still hidden in the bedroom.

\------------

Darkness had fallen by the time the thieves exited the main suite and started down the hall toward room 302.

Lutzwater Heights‚Äô was almost completely without electricity, excluding the suite that Christian visited daily. It was a cost saving measure, given that the building had no overnight tenets. They had used sparse natural lighting to usher Christian through the lobby and up the stairwells at first, but the arrival of a moonless night meant that was no longer a viable workaround to navigating the black, powerless labyrinth. Theo‚Äôs violent tantrum had also broken their only *real* flashlight, so the thieves were reduced to Theo phone‚Äôs dim flashlight for guidance.

Shepherded by the faint glow of Theo‚Äôs device, the men tiptoed down the hallway towards the next closest apartment. They didn‚Äôt know exactly *why* they were attempting to move silently - Theo had confirmed ahead of time that the building had no additional security or residents, so there should have been no one to hide from. Yet, it still felt unacceptably dangerous to stomp around Lutzwater Heights in the dead of night.

In a moment of voluminous silence, Charlie could swear he heard something skittering closer to them from behind. The noise was familiar - it was the same frenetic tapping he heard when he tossed his change down the strange well a week earlier. Immediately panicked, he used Theo‚Äôs wrist as a handle to turn the direction of the light one-hundred and eighty degrees. When he did, however, they saw nothing but the empty hallway that led back to Christian‚Äôs suite.

*‚ÄúWhat are you doing, psycho?‚Äù* Theo snapped, wrenching his hand away from Charlie‚Äôs grip.

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶hear that? The tapping?‚Äù* Charlie whispered, swiveling his head from side-to-side to identify the best possible angle for isolating the true origin of the noise, which now seemed to be spinning and twisting around him.

Theo heard the skittering, but he had been choosing to ignore it. Masking his own growing terror with a familiar bravado, he rebuked Charlie and continued to move forward.

*‚ÄúJesus man, get a grip. It‚Äôs probably just drizzling outside. Don‚Äôt have a coronary over some fucking rain.‚Äù*

Room 302 was just a short distance away from Theo. As he walked forward and he pivoted the knob, Charlie felt an uncontrollable twinge of fear sprint up and down his spine, but his only friend had already proceeded into the blackness before he could overcome that fear and stop him.

Reluctantly, he forced himself through the threshold after the young thief.

In a fevered rush of bravery, Charlie almost trampled Theo, who was just inside the room and fiddling with a dusty light switch. Despite a bevy of attempts, no electricity appeared to brighten the room and expunge the darkness as he flicked the loose plastic knub up and down.

*‚ÄúUgh, figures. Guess he wasn‚Äôt lying about the power.‚Äù* Theo declared impatiently, desperate for this experience to be over, but unwilling to admit defeat and leave without some financial reparations for their time. He stepped forward, momentarily illuminating something so grotesque and unexpected that it caused the phone to drop from Theo‚Äôs grip. It clattered to the floor, flashlight side-up, sliding just a little bit further into the tomb. When the phone stopped moving, it laid directly under the impossible anomaly, dramatically saturating it with light from below.

Multiple large, fleshy tubes ran the length of the otherwise empty living quarters. They were all approximately three feet in diameter, covered in sickly white skin that was adorned with hundreds of circumferential ridges, giving them the appearance of an unnaturally gigantic colon or earthworm. Each living cylinder came in and out of the room through different holes in the apartment‚Äôs four walls, occurring haphazardly at various positions and heights. The tunnels had jagged edges, because unlike the circular cavity tucked away behind the painting in Christian‚Äôs room, someone had not installed them meaningfully. Instead, something created them with physical force.

Because there was no forethought put into the holes design, the tubes ended up forming a tangled and overlapping mess - a ball of heavy, intertwining fingers. Though Theo and Charlie only saw about eight distinct tubes from their stunned vantage point, the real total occupying apartment 302 was roughly three times greater. Only an arm‚Äôs length from the writhing mass, the thieves watched as it gurgled and twisted with hideous, synchronous movement.

As the tubes squirmed, mists of the infernal aroma were expelled from their pores. The stench and the shock caused Charlie to fall back against the entryway and vomit, unintentionally closing the door and sealing the chamber.

Theo, although petrified by the hallucinatory creature, stooped and extended a shaking hand to get his phone. Only a foot from him, the device was inches below a tube that entered the living room‚Äôs top-left corner and slowly sagged downwards to another tunnel deeper within. Nearly on his knees, Theo contorted himself carefully to avoid letting his upper body make contact with another tube that hung higher and closer to the door. Through heavy breathing, the palm of his hand arrived at the phone, which covered the flashlight and plunged the room into a lightless void.

At that exact moment, Christian had finally managed to tip the wooden chair over, resulting in a loud, splintering crash. The distant noise caused a hypervigilant Theo to involuntarily stand and pivot his body to the left, moving to assess another potential threat by looking in the direction of the sound.

A wet slap resonated through the room. Theo‚Äôs cheek and forehead had collided with one of the writhing tubes when he stood, and the sensation startled him, causing the young thief to once again drop his phone. As the apparatus left his hand, the gleam of its flashlight reappeared to put a spotlight on Theo, forcing Charlie to bear witness to the hellish spectacle that followed.

The pallid skin of the tube trilled, resulting in a seismic ripple of tiny, pointed waves to appear around Theo‚Äôs head like a halo. No taller than a centimeter, thousands of alabaster spikes radiated in a circle from the point of contact, like the way a thrown pebble can send shockwaves over the surface of a previously still lake. As Theo tried to withdraw his forehead, a slab of vibrating flesh the size and shape of an oven mitt erupted outward from a part of the tube located directly above him. The awakened flesh perched in the air for a split-second - a wriggling, amorphous tombstone for the young thief.

Charlie followed the scene hypnotically, convinced he had taken a wrong turn somewhere and entered a daydream. It was almost like the tube wasn‚Äôt actually solid; he reflected indifferently. It was more a congealed liquid that had settled on structuring itself in a tube shape, for one reason or another. The creation of the fleshy tendril didn‚Äôt seem to damage the tube‚Äôs contents, as it should have if the tissue were solid, and more silvery skin quickly filled the space the tendril had occupied before it came to life.

In one swift motion, thousands of tiny, wriggling barbs sprouted from the side of the fleshy tombstone that faced Theo, only to come crashing down on his unprotected forehead and scalp.

Theo discharged an unearthly cacophony from his lungs. An impossibly concentrated terror made dissonant music through his fraying vocal cords, resulting in a scream so disconcertingly primal that it caused Charlie to kick his heels back against the floor, pushing himself into the fetal position in the room's corner. Steaming blood dripped down Theo‚Äôs face like melting candle wax, staining his visible skin a deep crimson.

From in front of Theo, another tube audibly shifted. The congealed skin appeared to be running its most superficial layer counterclockwise, like the tube was a sausage and the casing of it was whizzing around an unseen axis. A recognizable three slits slid into Charlie‚Äôs peripheral vision. The tube‚Äôs shifting slowed and stopped once the slits were parallel to Theo. They seemed to observe his distress indifferently, like someone who found a creature squealing under the harsh steel of a mousetrap in their cellar. It was trying to determine exactly what it had caught.

A moment later, Christian‚Äôs foot collided violently with 302‚Äôs door. He strode into the commotion with a confidence that showcased that he was relatively unphased by the horror before him. He remained handcuffed to a piece of the shattered wooden chair from the other room, dragging it with him as he walked. Christian beckoned to Charlie with the barrel of a shotgun, wordlessly imploring him to leave the room under his protection. The older thief frantically crawled on all fours in Christian‚Äôs direction, sprawling on his back and wailing once he had reached the safety of the unlit hallway.

Then, from the depths of 302, a blast rung out. The explosion permanently quieted Theo‚Äôs agony, leaving only the melody of Charlie‚Äôs sobs echoing through the apartment complex.

Dress shoes clicked towards Charlie, slow and deliberate. In a reversal of position, the snout of Christian‚Äôs still fuming shotgun pressed lightly against Charlie‚Äôs forehead.

From above him, Mr. Lutzwater dropped Theo‚Äôs phone next to his ear, still sticky and hot with viscous blood.

The flashlight remained on and functional despite the death of its owner, and the plasma now coating the lens had tinted the faint glimmer pink.

*‚ÄúGet up. Show me where you saw the well.‚Äù*

\----------------------------------------------

***Four:***

*Once there was a lonely young boy named Christian.*

*Although his family was staggeringly wealthy, an expansive mansion and a fleet of servants did not quell the young boy‚Äôs loneliness.*

*However, fate would soon intervene on the boy‚Äôs loneliness. A young girl named Tabitha skipped into Christian‚Äôs expansive backyard one day. They were fast friends, enjoying the same games and stories as each other.*

*Christian and Tabitha even kind of looked similar, like long-lost siblings or twins. But the resemblance was not a coincidence - no, this was intentional.*

*Rosemary and Sebastian, Christian‚Äôs parents, had purchased Tabitha from a local drunk. They had shopped around for many years, trying to find a child that looked like their Christian. Thankfully, Tabitha‚Äôs mother was more than happy to turn one of her children into money to purchase more liquor.*

*In a time before Christian‚Äôs birth, Sebastian had struck a deal with something old and infinite. It lived inside a well, whispering softly to a young, destitute Sebastian. It purposed a simple transaction - immense riches, a fix for his poverty, in exchange for the first of his eventual bloodline.*

*The young man agreed to the terms.*

*Thus, Sebastian was an overnight success in the world of real estate. And for a long while, things were prosperous and peaceful. Sebastian was not worried, either. If that thing in the well ever came back and asked for their end of the deal, he had a plan to circumvent the surrender of his firstborn.*

*Two years after Sebastian purchased Tabitha, he saw a familiar-looking well appear in the backyard, right around Christian‚Äôs eighth birthday.*

*Although it pained him, he enacted his plan that very night.*

*Quietly, as to not wake Christian, Sebastian and Rosemary rose Tabitha. As quickly as they could, they shaved her head to match Christian‚Äôs. Then, they dressed her in Christian‚Äôs clothes. Finally, they had their most trusted servant throw her down the well.*

*When Rosemary and Sebastian could no longer see the well or hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, they assumed their debt had been paid - their surrogate first-born accepted by the thing that lived in the well.*

*But Christian could still see the well. Christian could still hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, all day and all night. Overtime, the pitch of her voice became lower and lower. The cries of pain transitioned into screams of anger. And one night, Christian was summoned to his bedroom window by a skittering, tapping sound coming from the well.*

*Horrified, he watched as a massive worm emerged from the well, ascending the stone wall on thousands of legs that seemed to vanish and reappear as it climbed. It almost could not drag itself out of the hatch, its diameter being a near-perfect mold of the inside of the well, causing it to fit very snugly.*

*The end that first appeared from the well was flat and blunted, decorated with three, rippling slits - two vertical, one horizontal. In the beginning, it was no longer than a broomstick. But as it dragged more and more of the servants into the well at night, its size grew.*

*Christian could have warned his parents, but he knew the worm was Tabitha, and he wanted to protect her more than he wanted to save them. She skittered up the wall to his second-story bedroom, and he let her inside via the window. The details of the betrayal and the pain Tabitha had gone through convinced Christian to keep her transformation a secret.*

*He was sixteen when Tabitha finally pulled Sebastian and Rosemary into the well, crying out for Christian to help them. But at that point, Tabitha was almost a half mile long, living tangled up in the walls of the mansion. He couldn‚Äôt have helped them, even if he wanted to.*

*When Tabitha finally got too big for the house, she retreated into the sewers at Christian‚Äôs behest.*

*He promised he had found a new home for her, on the opposite side of the city.* 

*Christian would meet her there.*

\------------

At gunpoint, Christian forced Charlie to the front of Lutzwater Heights, guided by the dim light of Theo‚Äôs phone. During the short journey, Mr. Lutzwater bombarded his captive with an array of unintelligible ramblings. Christian never had anyone to talk to about Tabitha. So, when he had Charlie as his unwilling confident, someone who had seen Tabitha and lived, he simply couldn‚Äôt help himself. The floodgates broke, and years of pent-up madness spilled through.

*‚ÄúShe wants to leave and live in the sewers, but I won‚Äôt let her,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI had to evacuate the building - she was getting too big to only live in the walls, she needed to start living in the apartments, too,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe well still wants me - that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so hungry all the time. But I feed her, and she would never hurt me, no matter how hungry she got,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúTabitha gets hungrier at night - I told you we shouldn‚Äôt have gone in,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about this, but Tabitha is still hungry.‚Äù*

Outside Lutzwater Heights, by the well, Charlie desperately begged Christian to let him return home. But Mr. Lutzwater couldn‚Äôt hear anything he had to say over the deafening noise of his jagged, incomprehensible monologue.

As Charlie approached the well, shotgun to his back, Tabitha rose from the inky darkness. He shouted for help, but no one else was around the empty boluvard.

Before Charlie could make a break for it, she caught his leg and twisted around him like a boa constrictor. The pale flesh squished against his body. He braced himself to be devoured like Theo, but he remained intact as Tabitha coiled around him. The barbs, her teeth, had not yet rematerialized.

From his immobilized position, Charlie saw another piece of Tabitha silently slither out the front door. Christian‚Äôs endless monologue continued, even though Charlie could not hear a single word of it over the droning and churning of Tabitha‚Äôs liquid flesh.

Mr. Lutzwater never saw it coming.

Tabitha‚Äôs barbs dug into his right ankle and calf, causing an immediate and ear-splitting scream from Christian that only Charlie was around to hear. The congealed flesh then flipped him upside down, causing his head to slam violently into the hard earth, knocking him unconscious.

The thick tendril then hoisted him into the air, moving Christian directly over the well‚Äôs maw. As it did, the tentacle that was holding Charlie in place uncoiled and receded into the well, disappearing from view.

A voice then echoed from inside the well, deep and unfamiliar.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget about our deal, Charlie. This is what happens when you don‚Äôt abide by the terms.‚Äù*

And with that, the tentacle holding Christian released its grasp, causing him to fall noiselessly into the shadows. Shortly afterwards, that tentacle followed Christian in. For the next few hours, Charlie sat upright on the ground and wordlessly watched miles of Tabitha slither from the entrance of Lutzwater Heights into the well. As the sun rose, the last of her squeezed itself into the hatch. Once it did, Charlie could see the well no longer.

\------------

Two months later, Charlie had his first date with Hilda. She owned a coffee shop next door to where he had been getting therapy. Charlie never divulged to anyone what he saw happen that night - only admitting that he had a close friend pass away in front of him, never willing to divest additional details.

Hilda immediately fell for Charlie, despite his overwhelmingly colorless demeanor following Theo‚Äôs death. He was skeptical at first, but then Charlie recalled the terms of his deal.

Sometimes, he thinks he sees the well. In public and in private, lurking on the very edge of his peripheral vision. He frequently steels his conscious and compartmentalizes his emotions, not wanting to become too attached to the idea of Charlie Junior, despite Hilda being pregnant with their firstborn.

In the end, Charlie wasn‚Äôt exactly happy, but he certainly was not alone.

\-------------------

***Three:***

With twilight enveloping the landscape, Christian hastily twisted the key into the front door‚Äôs lock. As he shook the knob to confirm it was sealed, a handgun‚Äôs snout unexpectedly kissed his right temple.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move, don‚Äôt scream.‚Äù* Theo growled from under his ski mask in a voice so gravelly and cartoonish that Charlie needed to suppress a laugh stirring in his throat.

Although Mr. Lutzwater obeyed Theo‚Äôs commands, his austere aura evaporated, crumbling into primal fear. He lowered his voice to a whisper and attempted to negotiate with his captor, stuttering through bouts of hyperventilation.

*‚ÄúYes, yes‚Ä¶let me‚Ä¶let me show you to my veh-vehicle. I have‚Ä¶I have money‚Ä¶I have money there. And of course wi-with me.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúBut we need to go - we need to go now.‚Äù*

Snickering devilishly, Theo denied his request,

*‚ÄúNo, Christian. We want the money inside your suite first. If you don‚Äôt move to open the door in the next few seconds, I‚Äôm going to drive hot lead through your kneecaps, and then we‚Äôll drag you to your suite. Either way, we‚Äôre going in.‚Äù*

As Christian overcame his now full-body tremors enough to unlock the front door, Charlie began preemptively smearing Vaporub through wispy mustache hairs, expecting the embrace of that horrific odor the moment he stepped inside.

If he wasn‚Äôt so focused on the task at hand, he may have noticed the pungent aroma was conspicuously absent as the three men descended into the apartment complex. Or that, somehow, the well that was present in the garden just a week prior had dissolved into nothingness, leaving the surrounding soil present and undisturbed, like it had never been there in the first place.

\------------

With blood and broken teeth landing on the third-floor kitchen tile, Christian at last relented and spoke, unable to withstand another merciless beating.

*‚ÄúThe silver key with the red tip is a skeleton key. It opens all the apartments in the building. The pure gold one is for behind the painting.‚Äù* His tone boggy from the warm puddles of liquid accumulating in his mouth and throat.

*‚ÄúBut please - there is nothing here‚Ä¶nothing here that you want. We need‚Ä¶we need to go‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Charlie passed the keys to Theo, who went to inspect the cubby behind the painting. The older thief continued to monitor Christian, who was bound to a chair in the kitchen.

The first time that Charlie and Theo had interrogated a mark, they were soft and willing to compromise. Years of experience and desensitization, however, had made them inflexible and ruthless. It was for everyone‚Äôs benefit, Charlie rationalized. The faster they cave, the faster the experience can be over for all of them - pulling punches only prolonged the trauma.

*‚ÄúTabitha‚Ä¶Tabitha‚Ä¶oh lord forgive me‚Ä¶‚Äù* Christian muttered to himself, chin to chest, with plasma dripping from the corner of his mouth and on to the collar of his dress shirt.

The older thief had become concerned they may have bludgeoned Mr. Lutzwater a little *too* hard. The man had been spilling eerie nonsense from his lips since Theo‚Äôs knuckles met his skull. It was profoundly disconcerting, witnessing the battered mark plead to some unseen woman. Adding more wax beneath his nostrils, Charlie wished they‚Äôd had remembered duct tape. Something to silence his ominous caterwauling so they could work in peace.

*‚ÄúCharlie, come take a look at this,‚Äù* Theo shouted from the living room.

Frustrated, he left Christian to his ramblings and walked towards the sound of Theo‚Äôs voice, chastising his helplessness: *‚ÄúIf the key he said isn‚Äôt working on the safe, just start tryin‚Äô some of the other‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The ongoing criticism suffocated in Charlie‚Äôs windpipe when he saw what was behind the painting.

It was a circular hole, about the size of a manhole cover, and seething with darkness. A barred, steel gate separated the cavity inside the wall from the apartment, which was tilted outwards toward Theo, who had unlocked it and left it ajar using the gold key.

Charlie stumbled back, battered by the dreadful stench emanating from the aperture. The odor was an appalling mixture of algae, rusted metal, and sulfur, and it lingered almost palpably in the air like vaporized molasses. Even Theo, with his chronically impaired sense of smell, felt himself involuntarily stepping backwards from the deathly aroma.

From the other room, Christian‚Äôs pleading amplified in synchrony with the odor‚Äôs diffusion through the apartment. He howled for Tabitha to forgive him, and to forgive the intruders. He cried out, proclaiming that we were all about to leave and that she should stay where she was.

Charlie found himself paralyzed, swaying in place while his mind fought to comprehend their present circumstances. Theo, born without Charlie‚Äôs common sense, indifferently walked forward through the noxious vapors and placed his entire head and right arm in the hole, illuminating the space with a flashlight from his tool belt.

From inside the cavity, his words were muffled but audible: ‚Äú*Other than smelling like garbage fire, there‚Äôs nothing in here, Charlie. Goddamn, the space goes on for a while. I can‚Äôt really even tell where it ends.‚Äù*

As he yanked his upper body from the crevice, Theo misjudged his position and accidentally slammed the rear of his head against the edge of the black window. After a few twists and *‚Äúgoddamnits‚Äù,* he was free, but he was enraged. Now a bull seeing red on account of the throbbing pain, Theo angrily strode past Charlie and back into the kitchen. Without warning, he smashed the flashlight against Christian‚Äôs jaw with such force that the plexiglass protecting the lightbulb shattered.

*‚ÄúWhere the fuck is the money, dickhead?‚Äù* he shouted, livid from confusion.

Between the simmering panic and the accumulating injuries, Christian had become unresponsive. Unfortunately, this only served to further provoke the young thief. With another overhead arc of his flashlight, Charlie snapped into motion, grabbing Theo‚Äôs arm before he could bring it down on Christian again.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to kill him if you keep going. He said the silver key can open all the empty apartments, yeah? Let‚Äôs go check a few out. If there‚Äôs nothing in them, this may be a wash,‚Äù*

Charlie‚Äôs hushed tone soothed him, and Theo cooled. Within seconds, his anger was replaced with an intense embarrassment that his partner had witnessed such a volcanic outburst. The young thief had always hated his volatility, which caused him, in turn, to idolize Charlie‚Äôs temperament and control.

This calming technique was something Charlie had taught him years before. His initial skepticism caused him to dismiss Charlie‚Äôs advice. Upon trying it, however, Theo discovered that it worked like a charm - some emotional magic that he was somehow never given access to.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶sorry Ch-‚Ä¶, man. Stay put, asshole.‚Äù* Theo mumbled, almost divulging Charlie‚Äôs identity. He dropped the now broken flashlight at their feet with a calamitous thud. Charlie watched Christian as he did, whose head was laying limply to his right side. He didn‚Äôt flinch, so the thieves assumed he had been knocked out cold.

As their footfalls grew faint, Christian‚Äôs eyes shot open. Satisfied with his convincing theatrics, he began to teeter the wooden chair quietly, using the tips of his feet to slowly gain momentum despite the restraints.

He prayed that the crash would free enough of him to operate the shotgun still hidden in the bedroom.

\------------

Darkness had fallen by the time the thieves exited the main suite and started down the hall toward room 302.

Lutzwater Heights‚Äô was almost completely without electricity, excluding the suite that Christian visited daily. It was a cost saving measure, given that the building had no overnight tenets. They had used sparse natural lighting to usher Christian through the lobby and up the stairwells at first, but the arrival of a moonless night meant that was no longer a viable workaround to navigating the black, powerless labyrinth. Theo‚Äôs violent tantrum had also broken their only *real* flashlight, so the thieves were reduced to Theo phone‚Äôs dim flashlight for guidance.

Shepherded by the faint glow of Theo‚Äôs device, the men tiptoed down the hallway towards the next closest apartment. They didn‚Äôt know exactly *why* they were attempting to move silently - Theo had confirmed ahead of time that the building had no additional security or residents, so there should have been no one to hide from.

Immediately panicked, he used Theo‚Äôs wrist as a handle to turn the direction of the light one-hundred and eighty degrees. When he did, however, they saw nothing but the empty hallway that led back to Christian‚Äôs suite.

*‚ÄúWhat are you doing, psycho?‚Äù* Theo snapped, wrenching his hand away from Charlie‚Äôs grip.

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶hear that? The tapping?‚Äù* Charlie whispered, swiveling his head from side-to-side to identify the best possible angle for isolating the true origin of the noise, which now seemed to be spinning and twisting around him.

Theo heard the skittering, but he had been choosing to ignore it. Masking his own growing terror with a familiar bravado, he rebuked Charlie and continued to move forward.

*‚ÄúJesus man, get a grip. It‚Äôs probably just drizzling outside. Don‚Äôt have a coronary over some fucking rain.‚Äù*

Room 302 was just a short distance away from Theo. As he walked forward and he pivoted the knob, Charlie felt an uncontrollable twinge of fear sprint up and down his spine, but his only friend had already proceeded into the blackness before he could overcome that fear and stop him.

Reluctantly, he forced himself through the threshold after the young thief.

In a fevered rush of bravery, Charlie almost trampled Theo, who was just inside the room and fiddling with a dusty light switch. Despite a bevy of attempts, no electricity appeared to brighten the room and expunge the darkness as he flicked the loose plastic knub up and down.

It clattered to the floor, flashlight side-up, sliding just a little bit further into the tomb. When the phone stopped moving, it laid directly under the impossible anomaly, dramatically saturating it with light from below.

Multiple large, fleshy tubes ran the length of the otherwise empty living quarters. They were all approximately three feet in diameter, covered in sickly white skin that was adorned with hundreds of circumferential ridges, giving them the appearance of an unnaturally gigantic colon or earthworm. Each living cylinder came in and out of the room through different holes in the apartment‚Äôs four walls, occurring haphazardly at various positions and heights. The tunnels had jagged edges, because unlike the circular cavity tucked away behind the painting in Christian‚Äôs room, someone had not installed them meaningfully. Instead, something created them with physical force.

Because there was no forethought put into the holes design, the tubes ended up forming a tangled and overlapping mess - a ball of heavy, intertwining fingers. Though Theo and Charlie only saw about eight distinct tubes from their stunned vantage point, the real total occupying apartment 302 was roughly three times greater. Only an arm‚Äôs length from the writhing mass, the thieves watched as it gurgled and twisted with hideous, synchronous movement.

As the tubes squirmed, mists of the infernal aroma were expelled from their pores. The stench and the shock caused Charlie to fall back against the entryway and vomit, unintentionally closing the door and sealing the chamber.

Theo, although petrified by the hallucinatory creature, stooped and extended a shaking hand to get his phone. Only a foot from him, the device was inches below a tube that entered the living room‚Äôs top-left corner and slowly sagged downwards to another tunnel deeper within. Nearly on his knees, Theo contorted himself carefully to avoid letting his upper body make contact with another tube that hung higher and closer to the door. Through heavy breathing, the palm of his hand arrived at the phone, which covered the flashlight and plunged the room into a lightless void.

At that exact moment, Christian had finally managed to tip the wooden chair over, resulting in a loud, splintering crash. The distant noise caused a hypervigilant Theo to involuntarily stand and pivot his body to the left, moving to assess another potential threat by looking in the direction of the sound.

A wet slap resonated through the room. Theo‚Äôs cheek and forehead had collided with one of the writhing tubes when he stood, and the sensation startled him, causing the young thief to once again drop his phone. As the apparatus left his hand, the gleam of its flashlight reappeared to put a spotlight on Theo, forcing Charlie to bear witness to the hellish spectacle that followed.

The pallid skin of the tube trilled, resulting in a seismic ripple of tiny, pointed waves to appear around Theo‚Äôs head like a halo. No taller than a centimeter, thousands of alabaster spikes radiated in a circle from the point of contact, like the way a thrown pebble can send shockwaves over the surface of a previously still lake. As Theo tried to withdraw his forehead, a slab of vibrating flesh the size and shape of an oven mitt erupted outward from a part of the tube located directly above him. The awakened flesh perched in the air for a split-second - a wriggling, amorphous tombstone for the young thief.

Charlie followed the scene hypnotically, convinced he had taken a wrong turn somewhere and entered a daydream. It was almost like the tube wasn‚Äôt actually solid; he reflected indifferently. It was more a congealed liquid that had settled on structuring itself in a tube shape, for one reason or another. The creation of the fleshy tendril didn‚Äôt seem to damage the tube‚Äôs contents, as it should have if the tissue were solid, and more silvery skin quickly filled the space the tendril had occupied before it came to life.

In one swift motion, thousands of tiny, wriggling barbs sprouted from the side of the fleshy tombstone that faced Theo, only to come crashing down on his unprotected forehead and scalp.

Theo discharged an unearthly cacophony from his lungs. An impossibly concentrated terror made dissonant music through his fraying vocal cords, resulting in a scream so disconcertingly primal that it caused Charlie to kick his heels back against the floor, pushing himself into the fetal position in the room's corner. Steaming blood dripped down Theo‚Äôs face like melting candle wax, staining his visible skin a deep crimson.

From in front of Theo, another tube audibly shifted. The congealed skin appeared to be running its most superficial layer counterclockwise, like the tube was a sausage and the casing of it was whizzing around an unseen axis. A recognizable three slits slid into Charlie‚Äôs peripheral vision. The tube‚Äôs shifting slowed and stopped once the slits were parallel to Theo. They seemed to observe his distress indifferently, like someone who found a creature squealing under the harsh steel of a mousetrap in their cellar. It was trying to determine exactly what it had caught.

A moment later, Christian‚Äôs foot collided violently with 302‚Äôs door. He strode into the commotion with a confidence that showcased that he was relatively unphased by the horror before him. He remained handcuffed to a piece of the shattered wooden chair from the other room, dragging it with him as he walked. Christian beckoned to Charlie with the barrel of a shotgun, wordlessly imploring him to leave the room under his protection. The older thief frantically crawled on all fours in Christian‚Äôs direction, sprawling on his back and wailing once he had reached the safety of the unlit hallway.

Then, from the depths of 302, a blast rung out. The explosion permanently quieted Theo‚Äôs agony, leaving only the melody of Charlie‚Äôs sobs echoing through the apartment complex.

Dress shoes clicked towards Charlie, slow and deliberate. In a reversal of position, the snout of Christian‚Äôs still fuming shotgun pressed lightly against Charlie‚Äôs forehead.

From above him, Mr. Lutzwater dropped Theo‚Äôs phone next to his ear, still sticky and hot with viscous blood.

The flashlight remained on and functional despite the death of its owner, and the plasma now coating the lens had tinted the faint glimmer pink.

*‚ÄúGet up. Show me where you saw the well.‚Äù*

\----------------------------------------------

***Four:***

*Once there was a lonely young boy named Christian.*

*Although his family was staggeringly wealthy, an expansive mansion and a fleet of servants did not quell the young boy‚Äôs loneliness.*

*However, fate would soon intervene on the boy‚Äôs loneliness. A young girl named Tabitha skipped into Christian‚Äôs expansive backyard one day. They were fast friends, enjoying the same games and stories as each other.*

*Christian and Tabitha even kind of looked similar, like long-lost siblings or twins. But the resemblance was not a coincidence - no, this was intentional.*

*Rosemary and Sebastian, Christian‚Äôs parents, had purchased Tabitha from a local drunk. They had shopped around for many years, trying to find a child that looked like their Christian. Thankfully, Tabitha‚Äôs mother was more than happy to turn one of her children into money to purchase more liquor.*

*In a time before Christian‚Äôs birth, Sebastian had struck a deal with something old and infinite. It lived inside a well, whispering softly to a young, destitute Sebastian. It purposed a simple transaction - immense riches, a fix for his poverty, in exchange for the first of his eventual bloodline.*

*The young man agreed to the terms.*

*Thus, Sebastian was an overnight success in the world of real estate. And for a long while, things were prosperous and peaceful. Sebastian was not worried, either. If that thing in the well ever came back and asked for their end of the deal, he had a plan to circumvent the surrender of his firstborn.*

*Two years after Sebastian purchased Tabitha, he saw a familiar-looking well appear in the backyard, right around Christian‚Äôs eighth birthday.*

*Although it pained him, he enacted his plan that very night.*

*Quietly, as to not wake Christian, Sebastian and Rosemary rose Tabitha. As quickly as they could, they shaved her head to match Christian‚Äôs. Then, they dressed her in Christian‚Äôs clothes. Finally, they had their most trusted servant throw her down the well.*

*When Rosemary and Sebastian could no longer see the well or hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, they assumed their debt had been paid - their surrogate first-born accepted by the thing that lived in the well.*

*But Christian could still see the well. Christian could still hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, all day and all night. Overtime, the pitch of her voice became lower and lower. The cries of pain transitioned into screams of anger. And one night, Christian was summoned to his bedroom window by a skittering, tapping sound coming from the well.*

*Horrified, he watched as a massive worm emerged from the well, ascending the stone wall on thousands of legs that seemed to vanish and reappear as it climbed. It almost could not drag itself out of the hatch, its diameter being a near-perfect mold of the inside of the well, causing it to fit very snugly.*

*The end that first appeared from the well was flat and blunted, decorated with three, rippling slits - two vertical, one horizontal. In the beginning, it was no longer than a broomstick. But as it dragged more and more of the servants into the well at night, its size grew.*

*Christian could have warned his parents, but he knew the worm was Tabitha, and he wanted to protect her more than he wanted to save them. She skittered up the wall to his second-story bedroom, and he let her inside via the window. The details of the betrayal and the pain Tabitha had gone through convinced Christian to keep her transformation a secret.*

*He was sixteen when Tabitha finally pulled Sebastian and Rosemary into the well, crying out for Christian to help them. But at that point, Tabitha was almost a half mile long, living tangled up in the walls of the mansion. He couldn‚Äôt have helped them, even if he wanted to.*

*When Tabitha finally got too big for the house, she retreated into the sewers at Christian‚Äôs behest.*

*He promised he had found a new home for her, on the opposite side of the city.* 

*Christian would meet her there.*

\------------

At gunpoint, Christian forced Charlie to the front of Lutzwater Heights, guided by the dim light of Theo‚Äôs phone. During the short journey, Mr. Lutzwater bombarded his captive with an array of unintelligible ramblings. Christian never had anyone to talk to about Tabitha. So, when he had Charlie as his unwilling confident, someone who had seen Tabitha and lived, he simply couldn‚Äôt help himself. The floodgates broke, and years of pent-up madness spilled through.

*‚ÄúShe wants to leave and live in the sewers, but I won‚Äôt let her,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI had to evacuate the building - she was getting too big to only live in the walls, she needed to start living in the apartments, too,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe well still wants me - that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so hungry all the time. But I feed her, and she would never hurt me, no matter how hungry she got,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúTabitha gets hungrier at night - I told you we shouldn‚Äôt have gone in,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about this, but Tabitha is still hungry.‚Äù*

Outside Lutzwater Heights, by the well, Charlie desperately begged Christian to let him return home. But Mr. Lutzwater couldn‚Äôt hear anything he had to say over the deafening noise of his jagged, incomprehensible monologue.

As Charlie approached the well, shotgun to his back, Tabitha rose from the inky darkness. He shouted for help, but no one else was around the empty boluvard.

Before Charlie could make a break for it, she caught his leg and twisted around him like a boa constrictor. The pale flesh squished against his body. He braced himself to be devoured like Theo, but he remained intact as Tabitha coiled around him. The barbs, her teeth, had not yet rematerialized.

From his immobilized position, Charlie saw another piece of Tabitha silently slither out the front door. Christian‚Äôs endless monologue continued, even though Charlie could not hear a single word of it over the droning and churning of Tabitha‚Äôs liquid flesh.

Mr. Lutzwater never saw it coming.

Tabitha‚Äôs barbs dug into his right ankle and calf, causing an immediate and ear-splitting scream from Christian that only Charlie was around to hear. The congealed flesh then flipped him upside down, causing his head to slam violently into the hard earth, knocking him unconscious.

The thick tendril then hoisted him into the air, moving Christian directly over the well‚Äôs maw. As it did, the tentacle that was holding Charlie in place uncoiled and receded into the well, disappearing from view.

A voice then echoed from inside the well, deep and unfamiliar.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget about our deal, Charlie. This is what happens when you don‚Äôt abide by the terms.‚Äù*

And with that, the tentacle holding Christian released its grasp, causing him to fall noiselessly into the shadows. Shortly afterwards, that tentacle followed Christian in. For the next few hours, Charlie sat upright on the ground and wordlessly watched miles of Tabitha slither from the entrance of Lutzwater Heights into the well. As the sun rose, the last of her squeezed itself into the hatch. Once it did, Charlie could see the well no longer.

\------------

Two months later, Charlie had his first date with Hilda. She owned a coffee shop next door to where he had been getting therapy. Charlie never divulged to anyone what he saw happen that night - only admitting that he had a close friend pass away in front of him, never willing to divest additional details.

Hilda immediately fell for Charlie, despite his overwhelmingly colorless demeanor following Theo‚Äôs death. He was skeptical at first, but then Charlie recalled the terms of his deal.

Sometimes, he thinks he sees the well. In public and in private, lurking on the very edge of his peripheral vision. He frequently steels his conscious and compartmentalizes his emotions, not wanting to become too attached to the idea of Charlie Junior, despite Hilda being pregnant with their firstborn.

In the end, Charlie wasn‚Äôt exactly happy, but he certainly was not alone.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

2) We are also huge fans of Thai food so what are some great and not too pricey options for Thai cuisine all over Sydney?

","Hello - I‚Äôm going to try and be a little different from the usual posts.¬† This post is for the women out there who don‚Äôt necessarily post but are reading the posts of others.¬† I hope this catches your eye.

56 yr old married male looking for an on-line connection/relationship.¬† I‚Äôm married and in a stable relationship.¬† Not looking for change and have a zero drama life.¬† However, as is so common, I am missing things in my life.¬† I miss the daily connection with someone - working from a home office since 2008 doesn‚Äôt help either.¬† Would love to find a gal in a similar situation (prefer married/divorced mom, just more in common but all welcome to reply) who would like someone to talk with, and share, someone to connect with.¬† Looking to find someone with common ground and similar experiences.¬†

* I will not bug you to ‚Äúhook up‚Äù. I‚Äôm not opposed to eventually meeting/coffee date but that is not the end game.¬† If you are not in the area, that‚Äôs fine too.¬† I do travel a lot for work, especially up and down the west coast.
* I will not bug you for pictures.¬† If you want to swap a couple face pics that would be great.¬† But it is not a deal breaker if you don‚Äôt want to do that, or do it right away.
* You will not get unsolicited pics from me - re: no announced dick pics.¬† Ugh.
* I don‚Äôt chat with multiple people - first reply gets 100% of my attention.

I am a mature, kind person.¬† No judgement, no drama, good listener, empathetic.¬† I like to ask questions.¬† If it matters, I am attractive and take very good care of myself and my body.¬† I am a business professional and I have lots of things to talk about - I‚Äôm big into music, fountain pens and inks.¬† I can hold intelligent and coherent conversations.¬† Looking to discover passion in ordinary things.¬† I have done the OLA before and I do have a lot of time to invest into it.¬† I‚Äôm emotionally in a good position to do this.¬† **Please be at least 30 yrs old and in the U.S.A.** ¬†
