I just pourover and aeropress for brewing coffee which is mostly medium/ light roasted. I use following water at following temperatures( in degree celsius) :-

Roast        Pourover    Aeropress
Light            95            91
Medium      93            88
Dark             91           85

Is this correct? Is there any guideline to this? What temperature brings out the correct notes of coffee?

1q4fwz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobs/comments/1q4fwz1/i_run_a_35person_remote_company_heres_what_i_wish/,I run a 35-person remote company. Here's what I wish more applicants knew.,"I get asked about this stuff all the time so figured I'd write it up and have a place to point people to.
we've been fully remote for about a year now. team spread around - i'm based in the US but have key people in the UK and Mexico. I've reviewed a lot of applications and sat in on a lot of interviews at this point, and there are some patterns I keep seeing.
for every role we post, we get flooded with applications. most are immediate rejections. figured I'd share what actually seems to matter - at least from our side of the table.

**things that stand out (in a good way):**

clear writing. this is the big one. in a remote environment, most communication is written. if your application is scattered or hard to follow, that's a signal. the people who write clearly tend to work well async.

specificity. when someone references something specific about the role or the company, it's obvious they actually read the posting. sounds basic but most applications are generic.

proof of self-direction. remote work means nobody is looking over your shoulder. if you can show examples of projects you drove on your own or problems you solved without being told exactly how, that matters.

**things that get applications filtered out:**
sloppy emails. typos happen, but if the application itself feels rushed, that's usually a no.
""i'm a fast learner"" with nothing to back it up. everyone says this.

no cover letter on roles that ask for one. if you skip it, we assume you're mass applying.
trying to prove you're a great ""office worker."" remote isn't office work done from home - it's a different operating system. if your resume highlights how many meetings you led, that's actually a red flag for us. I'd rather know how many meetings you eliminated.

**some stuff about remote work that's worth knowing:**

async communication is a skill. writing a message that someone in another timezone can act on without needing to ask follow-up questions - that's valuable. it's not something most people think about but it makes a big difference.

""culture fit"" in remote means something different. it's less about personality and more about communication habits and reliability. can you hit deadlines without being chased? do you surface problems early? that's what matters.

loneliness affects performance more than people admit. when you're interviewing, ask the company how they handle social connection. we do optional silent coworking sessions on zoom and offer stipends for coffee shops. if a company doesn't have an answer for this, they might have churn issues.

a lot of job postings are dead. big companies leave listings up forever. this is frustrating for everyone. smaller companies and boards that verify listings tend to have more active roles.

**where we've had luck finding candidates:**

we stopped using Indeed and LinkedIn easy apply. the volume was too high and most applications weren't relevant. felt like we were filtering out 90% of noise just to find one real person.

**here's where we've had the best luck:**

[Arc](https://arc.dev) - for engineering roles. they vet candidates which saves time on both sides.

[Working Nomads](https://www.workingnomads.com/jobs) - we've had good luck here for international candidates and contract roles. if you're outside the US or open to contract work, I'd start here.

[Remote Job Assistant](https://www.remotejobassistant.com) - worth checking out, we've found some solid candidates here.

[Wellfound](https://wellfound.com) - good for startup-oriented people who get equity and remote culture.

WeWorkRemotely and RemoteOK work too but they're high volume. more competition per listing.
if you want to signal you're ""remote native"":
learn the tools. if I see these on a resume, I assume onboarding will be fast:
slack (channels over DMs)
notion for documentation
loom for async video updates
linear if you're in product/eng
for anyone considering contractor or freelance work:

**a few things that tripped us up early:**

contractor vs employee classification matters. if a company controls your hours and gives you a company email, some jurisdictions consider that employment. get this right upfront. services like [Deel](https://www.deel.com/) or Remote.com handle compliance if you're working across borders.

keep clean records of payments, especially international ones. exchange rates, dates, amounts. makes taxes much easier.

one dedicated card for work expenses is worth it. we found a few hundred dollars a month in unused subscriptions just by looking at one statement.

1. He has texted me every day since our first date. 
2. He blew off some friends to spend the evening and night (and the following day) with me. 
3. He wants to sleep over and me to sleep over at his place, we also usually cook and/or get coffee after staying over at each others places. 
4. He doesn’t ask me that many questions as I ask him, so I feel like he might not be romantically interested in me. 
5. So far, he hasn’t really kissed me in public. 
6. Talking to him doesn’t feel as easy to me, mainly because I feel I‘m doing most of the heavy lifting, however he usually is more in touch after we have just slept together. 
7. I know he isn’t sleeping with anyone else.

1q4ftio,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1q4ftio/ayitl_how_it_shouldve_ended/,AYITL: How it should’ve ended,"One day as I was taking my teenaged daughter to work, she and I were discussing how disappointing A Year in the Life was. We decided to come up with our own ending that made it a bit more satisfying. I’m sure it’s not perfect and that some will disagree, but we had so much fun coming up with the details that I thought I’d share it here. 😊 (Yes, we are assuming Rory’s baby is Logan’s.) 

Logan and his fiancée decide to part ways after realizing that they don’t actually love each other since their engagement was essentially arranged by their families anyway. Meanwhile, Rory decides she should tell Logan about the baby after all. She and Logan meet up in London, each to tell the other about their news. Logan proposes, and Rory accepts. 

Since finding out about Rory’s baby, Luke has been extremely over-protective of the mother-to-be, to the point of always serving her decaf coffee (whether she wants it or not) and way more food than she can ever eat in one sitting. Luke claims to not be overly excited about the baby (who he says will be loud and snotty and gross), but he also somehow finds time to build all sorts of cute things for the baby - a cradle, a rocking horse, a rocking chair, toys - all with “extra wood” he had that was “just lying around and taking up space”. 

Rory’s book is well on its way to being finished and will definitely be a best-seller. 

Lorelei can’t believe she’s going to become a grandmother and goes through all kinds of lines from obscure/old movies in describing how she’s too young to be that “old”. 

Emily, still living in Nantucket with Berta and her family, is over the moon that Rory is having a baby and marrying Logan, and has already put the baby on the waitlists for every prestigious preschool she can think of. Also, she has found companionship in a widowed friend of Berta’s family, and the two have eloped. She’s still trying to figure out what language Berta’s family speaks, but has gotten pretty good at communicating with them. She plans to have a portrait painted of Rory, Logan, and the new baby as soon as possible. 

Sookie caters the baby shower for Rory, and of course the whole town shows up. In true Sookie fashion, there’s a huge variety of delicious foods, as well as a couple of small fires that are quickly extinguished by her assistants. Lane’s band is the entertainment for the evening. 

Rory makes several pros/cons lists about various childbirth and baby care decisions. She packs several different books in her hospital bag, just in case she feels like reading Tolstoy or Orwell or Bradbury while in labor. 

She and Logan stop in to Mrs. Kim’s antique store to browse for nursery furniture. After lecturing them about reading the Bible to the baby every night before it’s even born, reminding Rory of all the health benefits of tofu, and pressuring them into several purchases, Mrs Kim smiles and says that she appreciates their business. 

When Rory goes into labor, she complains to her mom that she never told her it would hurt this much. Lorelei replies with something about having to lie to her about the pain so she wouldn’t freak out about it ahead of time. Luke drives them all to the hospital in his truck.  Miss Patty and Babette barge into the labor/delivery room at some point. Babette is talking in her usual loud voice (“Oh honey! I can’t believe you’re gonna push a whole kid out of your little hoo-ha! Does it hurt?? This is why Morey and I only had cats!”), and taking pictures at inappropriate moments. Miss Patty has found a male nurse to flirt with and is making endless innuendo-laced remarks about scrubs and cute tushies. 

Kirk is also at the hospital, working as a candy-striper. He looks ridiculous in his striped apron and is somewhat embarrassed to admit that he only took on the volunteer work because he thought it involved actual candy (and because Taylor still won’t allow him to work at his Olde Fashioned Soda Shoppe). 

Logan has been out of town on business, but arrives just in time. Chris and Emily are at the hospital too. (Emily has softened since the last time she was in a hospital, but is still demanding proper pillows and every comfort for Rory.)

Rory has a healthy and very cute baby boy.

1q4ftbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1q4ftbg/outgrowing_without_guilt/,outgrowing without guilt,"There’s this one friend I’ve almost lost contact with because I felt like we’ve really outgrown each other. She kept messaging me, but I just couldn’t bring myself to reply.

Last year, I decided to give the friendship another chance because I felt guilty. I thought maybe I was just overthinking or being too negative. But every time we hang out, I always go home stressed. There’s never a time she doesn’t bring up my ex and the side chick, kahit four years na kaming wala. Minsan pakiramdam ko she’s trying to get a reaction from me.

Kaya sinuggest ko na baka next time, we try doing something different like hobbies or activities, hindi yung laging coffee shop lang.. Okay lang naman mag-reminisce minsan, pero hindi palagi. Nakakapagod kasi parang umiikot lang yung mundo namin sa mga taong wala na sa present ng buhay namin.

But last night was really my last straw. She called me OA and KJ just because I didn’t want to join an activity where you have to share your manifestations. I prefer keeping mine private and to myself, bawal ba ’yon? Then she said I need to pray my manifestations. Does she really think she’s the only one praying in the group just because sya yung pala church????

I just want to be free from this friendship without feeling guilty. Can we accept that we outgrow people and that it’s okay to part ways? It feels like we’re no longer aligned. I hate how every time I open up, my words get twisted into something else, it feels so suffocating. I also hate that she perceives me in a way that isn’t true, and lalo na every time i share something, may pa ""weeeeeh?"" ahhhh nakakapagod",8,1767599828.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Julia shared a smile with her old boss as she handed the woman a softball question to get the tour started. Katja nodded and waved a hand around them as they walked, then went on to an explanation of the costs involved of getting *anything* to this outpost, the growing number of people they were bringing in who weren’t research experts to do things like grow plants for food and atmosphere recycling. Julia knew all of it, and had helped Katja with some of the procurement. 

What held Julia's interest was the place itself. She let her eyes wander and held her hands a little away from her body, took a few calming breaths, and allowed herself to fall into something of a light walking trance as she tried to get a feel for the place. Her eyes flitted about, taking note of an uncountable number of sapients of all shapes and sizes bustling about on foot or small vehicles. At the same time another part of her mind took note of the layers of directional markings that her translator couldn’t decipher – something she’d never encountered before in her life – on the walls. A cacophony of sound reached her ears from so many people bustling about, holding conversations, having arguments, working with tools, pushing carts, and so much more. The layout seemed overly spatious, and obviously not laid out by any League design. 

General League design patterns had been set in documents long, long ago, and most species tried to give those patterns at least a wink and a nod when building anything likely to see multiple species. This place… had absolutely not been built to that pattern. It was a subtle thing, one which you almost had to both be aware of and look for to consciously notice, but it was there. 

Other things about the structure leapt out at her; she imagined she could *feel* the incredible age of the composites which had been built over the rock of the asteroid. Hey all looked strong, stark, even like they could have rolled off their marker’s machines yesterday. Still, though… the layers of writing, the slight uneven way light sometimes hit certain sections, tiny imperfections around a door which had been opened so many times; a thousand little things that she couldn’t consciously identify but which her semi-conscious knew how to interpret came together and presented information in an emotion rather than an explanation. 

She could feel the cold, the long wait in the quiet dark as this place waited out the centuries between its brief periods of occupancy… and she could feel the hectic, energized, headlong energy of each of those periods. The thrill of discovery, the joy of comradery of the most brilliant minds that sapient space had to offer coming together to push the boundaries of knowledge; but also the underpinning of desperation. 

Her eyes snapped open wide and she almost missed a step as the trance-like state broke and she studied the people around her again. She could see it, now: A tremor of the hand here, a furtive look there, hard edges to laughter, and even steps which seemed both hurried and halting at the same time. 

*They feel it, here, more than anywhere else in the League. What we are up against, what is at stake, and how little time we really have. Usually at some stage just before FTL for each species, there is a period where scientific and engineering progress seems to come in leaps and bounds, and the world of one’s birth can seem unrecognizable even by the time that you are nurturing your grandchildren.* 

*Somehow that seems to leave an indelible mark on our cultures, and we seem to think that scientific progress is this rapid thing, but it slows down. By the time any species gets caught up with the forefront of the League true breakthroughs have decades – even centuries – between them, not months or years.* She suppressed a sigh. *I guess that it is partly the fault of our extended lifespans.* 

*Here, though. These are the kinds of people who spend their lives on the forefront of the advances, and know how long they take. They know how far ahead some of the tech in the most successful battle footage is, and how long it would take us to get there by ourselves, and they know how much data from this place – yet – to get us there, either.*

A door shut behind her, and the sounds of the station cut off, shaking her out of her ruminations as they entered a meeting room. *Yes, a meeting room, not a conference room.* This was a space for engineering and scientific minds to push and pull at ideas, not for discussion of business or political topics. A dozen little signs, from the extra screens to the room's shape, told her it was so. 

They took their seats and her Dad wrapped up the reminiscences with Katja. The station director turned to them all and smiled. “I am so glad to have you three here. We have done so much work here, working with this data. I don’t get the chance to show it off much to visitors.” 

They all nodded. Julia answered. “We are very glad to be here. We brought you the personal items you requested, by the way. They are in our luggage, and we’ll get them to you later.” 

Her mother cocked her head a little. “You have trouble getting certain items out here? I wondered when I put the things together. The items are so simple, foods, bath salts…” 

Dad looked at her and raised a single eyebrow. “Dear, consider a moment. Space on the transports out here has to be limited. No doubt they have rationing on comfort items that can be brought out…” 

Mom gave a rueful smile. “And, the High and Mighty boss must lead by example, right? So, you have to make sure you do even less requisitioning of such items?” 

Katja nodded. “Too many people see the manifests. We are limited by volume, not weight or even price, and the personal crates are supposed to be private. Still, well, they aren’t. Not enough. Given that I don’t feel right using official channels to bring in items that I hand out as rewards or, say, this wine that I keep on hand for visitors… I end up with a bit less for myself than I might like.” 

Julia nodded. “You always were one to lead by example, and ask more of yourself than you did anyone else.” She let her face harden a bit. “Just make sure…” 

Katja gave her a touch of side-eye and waved a hand. “Oh, I take care of myself, dear, don’t you fret. Honestly, I stay so busy here that I rarely have the time to even miss the creature comforts… and that is fine, by the way, so you can stop looking at me like that.” 

Julia nodded. “I am sure you are. You have the largest, densest gathering of the greatest minds that the League has, in ways that are unprecedented. Just trying to keep all those egos from escaping out the airlock has to be a full time job!”

Katja joined the chuckle and nodded. “You are wondering how I am keeping morale up around here, despite the sense of doom which seems to pervade these halls, and you have concerns about security.” 

Julia nodded. Dad gave her a sharp look. She knew he’d rather have some time for them to all renew their bonds of friendship, and here they were falling directly into business. *I blame both Katja and myself. We worked together too long, became too familiar, and always stayed so engrossed in the work. Old habits and all that.* 

She saw Katja catch the interplay, and pointedly choose to ignore it as she continued. “Both are fair questions, and – given the way you were taking the social temperature of this place on the way in – it is probably good for us to cover that ground and get it out of the way before we take the chance to just enjoy a little time together. 

“So, first I will go to security, and say that it doesn’t concern us much. Somewhat counter-intuitively, that is largely because of the same sense of desperation and cloud of doom that haunts these walls.” 

Mom interrupted. “That is twice in a few minutes you have referenced this feeling. I have to confess I have noticed it, to an extent, but thought it was just my own imagination.” 

Katja made an indelicate noise and gave Mom a wry look. “It is probably fair to say that it is just in your imagination… but it in is in mine, too. And your husbands, and your daughters, and the imagination of every single sapient I have bothered to even obliquely discuss the matter with. This station was built, untold eons ago, for a singular purpose: to give a sliver of hope in a war that will probably not be won by any who walk these halls. 

“It is hard to even know how many times this place has been occupied, and how many people have railed against the coming dark only to leave – knowing they went to their deaths – in order to give some future beings the barest chance at success.” 

Katja’s eyes got a far-off look, and a hand stretched out towards a wall, as if she wanted to reach through the wall to the rock that lay, somewhere, beyond. “There is more history in this place, within these walls, than on many populated worlds within the League… and that is before you get into the entire volumes of history stored within countless racks of data crystals. 

“So, security is not much of a concern because of the desperation of the work. No one is brought here who has not realized, deep within their bones, that the Old Machines are coming, and that they can’t be bargained with nor diverted.” 

The words seemed to bring down the temperature of the room by several degrees, and some part of Julia almost wished she had coffee instead of wine. Her eyes narrowed a little as her mind began to pick at the phrase. *Something in there, it is an unsettling thought, to be sure, but something about it bothers me more than it should.* She filed the thought away as Katja continued. 

“In fact, the only security incident we have had was the one with those researchers who stole the ship, and we see that as more of a morale problem than a security issue.” She held up a hand to forestall questions. “And, that brings me over to the subject of Morale, and how we deal with it. The primary method is the reason why you,” Julia met her eyes as Katja pointed at her, “keep getting requests from me for more transports to carry people around. We try not to have any of the research staff – with a few exceptions who have mental peculiarities that make them suited to this place – stay ‘on the rock’ for more than about eight months at a time. 

“We send them out on tours of civilian facilities, Universities, speaking engagements, whatever we can find that works for their personal temperament and will advance the project. We also require them to take a long furlough with each rotation out. Again, requirements vary by individual, but once you step foot on an outgoing transport you aren’t coming back here for at least four months, though for some it can be as much as a year. 

“Of course, a fair number find places in the League they feel they contribute and decide to stay. We encourage that. We are getting major breakthroughs on a regular basis, and a lot of them are coming from those teams that are headed by people who did a stint or two here then went home. Of course, we also get a lot from first-timers coming in with fresh eyes, and people who come back bringing fresh perspective.

I decided to switch to a breville bambino.  As such, I also order a normcore portafilter.  The problem I'm currently having is with baskets.  I had read somewhere that someone thought the normcore standard basket was worse than the breville bottomless basket.  

This being said, I went down the rabbit whole of very limited options for Bambino.  I noticed that while IMS seems to be the main standard, that many had lukewarm feelings for it based on search results.  Both the Pullman Breville basket and the Pesado basket are very difficult to source, and when I can find one on sale, there's international shipping on top of the expensive price tag.

Is there a basket that is either cheaper, or easier to source than the pescado or pullman baskets, but has a similar vibe?  For context, I plan to attempt to be pulling largely light to medium roast coffees. Originally I was going to be getting one regular precision basket for medium to dark, and one high extraction basket for light to medium-light.",1,1767599259.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1q4fn99,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOverload/comments/1q4fn99/reflections_on_on_clubbing_primarily_through_an/,Reflections on on clubbing primarily through an Australian perspective,"I entered the new year at [Un:send](https://www.unsend.world/) a small (""boutique"") festival in the Australian bush (Tallarook Victoria) and had a very refreshing and positive experience. This was also my experience at another doof/festival called [Soma](https://soma-festival.com/), also located in the Australian bush.

These festivals and a few local parties recently have drummed up a few reflections on my experience clubbing/doofing as perhaps someone in there twilight years of this activity.

My experience with clubbing/doofing is small, consisting predominately from growing up in a local scene that had restrictive laws on late night music which relegated most 'good' parties to the underground warehouse circuit (the number of which fluctuates between 1 and 3 of the course of the year). A few doofs\* here or there (\*large parties or electronic music festivals in the Australian bush), and also, a 3 month stint in Berlin where i rinsed it lol.

Un:send was a three day, three night festival with a lineup consisting of artists like: Priori, Kia, Keirnan Laveux, Moopie, Reptant & Miscmeg, Pilgrims of the Mind, and many many more talented artists. At first i was reluctant to head to Victoria who's scene i paint unfairly with a broard brush as ""large"" and ""trendy"" and probably kind of intimidating. Once we got there the the 60km gust winds for two days that generated a sand and dust storm that ruined or tarnished various  aspects of the festival; (e.g. food vendors, various pop-up salons and art, stage design). This weather pattern could have truly killed the experience, however, most punters seemed to rally together at the stage(s) with scarfs/masks, sunglasses and hats and general positive air. I too was feeling cheeky and gregarious and most random conversations i struck up with people were received well and kind.

I definitely didn't lock in to the sets as much as i'd like as i prioritised socialising and catching up/meeting people. I also helped out at the festival a bit managing the stage by the lake and that perhaps helped me feel more connected with the people and the experience.

Some highlights of my time:

* DJ Qz & Naycab - super bouncy. fun and clubby set. Probably the only 'club' heavy set of the festival that had more alternative sounds like jersey, club, and uk sound stuff
* Moopie (Morning set) - despite the sand storm, i enjoyed my coffee and Moopie mixing relaxing day time stuff (perhaps from his label)
* Misc Meg & Reptant (love birds bringing in the new year. No countdown was had on the main stage but the music softened and revellers hugged, and all was well in the world for that one particular moment of euphoria).
* Mad Miran - my highlight set,, i mean i was pretty intox but the way she mixes to the tracks without the kick drums. Damn i wish i could see her longer than two hours.
* Hysterical Love Project (by the dam) melb trip hop, very relaxing, very good vibes.
* Pilgrims of the Mind - also a dj set by the dam, was very relaxing and the wind had finally died down. The artist himself seemed so fucking happy to be there which made me happy
* Kia & Priori - our local treasure with NY's finest, he seems to like it in Aus as he played with Cousin this weekend.
* Moopie (at night) - high energy, fun, however i was deluded with fatigue by this point and called it after this. This should have been the closing set but the festival finished an hour later with a live set from C3D-E which i didnt see and apparently was a bit anti-climactic.

However, aside from describing my experience, i've thought a lot about club culture in Australia and wanted to share some things i have noticed recently in the hopes to generate discussion with people who live in different areas and may have further comments.

* Way less fucked up revellers. When i was younger I noticed a lot more darker aspects of rave culture. Mostly men in the early hours of the morning, clearly taken too much, perhaps drunk or so. Sometimes you could tell people were drunk, or others that had been up for days on e or speed, but lately, everyone seems to be pretty well put together, cognisant and somewhat rested. Also going to bed at the campsite was not too difficult as there weren't many kick ons at campsites and most people were kicking on near the stages, or various spaced when music had stopped.
* Way more groups of women coming to these events, maybe it's due to the increase in representation of women on the bill, or perhaps feeling safer in these places (see above point). But i noticed solid groups of girls that were camping and partying together that clearly hadn't come with a group of guys. I know this come across as a sexist observation but when i was younger it would usually be mixed groups of campers (men and women) and perhaps more groups of men going together with a few girl friends.
* The Y2K era is back with a vengeance. Whether its low cut jeans with whale tails out. Or trip-hop artists popping up everywhere. It seems this is well and truly the trend in Australia the past few years and I don't know how i feel about it. Maybe it's a bit derivative or maybe i'm being rude. 
* Gorpcore and cybersigilism tattoos are also very trendy in the clubbing community. I felt silly wearing my blundstone boots but obviously no one was looking at me. 
* Chatting is getting worse both at festivals and parties. This might be an Aussie thing, and look i am definitely more guilty of this sometimes, but even deep in the crowd it can be quite chatty, or until the music is turned up (clubbing specific).

Would love to hear from people in other locations and your reflections on clubbing and perhaps any similarities or differences you've noticed in your local scene or travelling or going to various parties. Or just in general, how your nye was?

I have already completed two internships in 2025, one for an out of state nonprofit and the other for a state government agency - the former I half assed over the summer so no reccs. for me from there :/ - and the latter I always just worked in my cubicle and never actually networked so I could never call up any connections from it.

I honestly only started applied for spring 2026 positions in late November and just haven't heard anything back, except for two interviews and one ""we were really impressed with your credentials but picked someone else for the job."" I've utilized my school's resources fairly well last fall - career fairs, resume reviews, mock interviews, etc. and don't think there was a whole lot wrong with my applications. So now that I will graduate in 9 months and need something to beef up my resume right now, what should I be doing (other than applying for summer internships)? Projects? Research?

**Chapter** 1 

On Christmas Eve, my boyfriend, Miles Peyton, told me his group was short one player for a round 

of Werewolf and asked me **to** fill in. 

We’d been together for three years, yet this was the first time he ever brought me into his circle of 

friends. I even studied the rules in advance. 

When the moderator announced, “It’s night. Everybody close your eyes. Werewolves, **you** may open your eyes.” 

I shut my eyes. A moment later, I heard the faint rustle of clothing beside me. Then came a softer 

sound–wet, subtle, unmistakably intimate. 

It came from the direction where my boyfriend and his childhood friend, Sabrina Hayes, were 

seated. 

The sticky, ambiguous noise made something pull tight inside my chest. But the rules said to keep 

my eyes shut, so I forced myself to ignore the twist in my gut. 

When the moderator spoke again, “Witch, you may open your eyes.” I lifted my lids, adjusting to the returning light. 

Instinctively, my gaze moved first to Miles There was a smear of glossy red at the corner of his mouth–too bright, too slick, nothing like his actual lip color. 

My eyes shifted to the girl on his other side. Sabrina’s lips, usually neat and full, had a ring of cherry–red lipstick smudged around the edges. The color matched the mark on Miles perfectly. 

\*\*\* 

I curled my fingers into my palm and swallowed the words that almost slipped out. 

Maybe it was accidental. Maybe they bumped into each other. I told myself that, refusing to ruin my first time meeting his friends. 

The moderator continued, “Witch, this player died tonight. Do you want to save her?” He pointed at me. After a brief pause, I chose to use the antidote on myself. 

The game moved into the daytime round. The moderator rang the little bell on the table. “Morning, everyone. Last night was Christmas Eve.” 

Sabrina froze slightly. Her gaze flicked toward me, flash of open disappointment and surprise in her eyes. As if I should have been eliminated on the first night. 

The moderator went on, “We’ll speak in order. Miss Hayes, you start.” 

Remembering the noises I heard while my eyes were closed, I kept my tone steady. “I think the 

werewolves are Miles and Sabrina.”

“When my eyes were shut earlier, there were unusual sounds to my left, coming from where the 

two of them were seated.” 

My words had barely landed when a sharp, mocking laugh cut through the air. **It** came from Logan Reed, Miles’s longtime buddy. 

“Miles, does your girl even know how to play?**”** 

“Werewolf is about logic. Since when do outside noises count as evidence?” 

“If we’re going by that, my ears are sharp too. I heard her breathing get all heavy. Should I call her a 

werewolf for that?” 

“Yeah, if you can’t handle the game, don’t ruin it for everyone.‘ 

“Rules are rules. Don’t talk nonsense.” 

A few others echoed him with casual, thoughtless agreement. 

I tried to explain, but Miles suddenly pressed down on my wrist. His palm was warm through my sleeve, yet his voice sided completely with his friends. “They’re right. Werewolf has its own rules.” 

“You can learn as you go, but don’t bring in things that aren’t part of the game. It throws everyone 

off.” 

My lips parted, but the words stuck in my throat. 

A memory surfaced–back when Miles and I first started dating, I once got into an argument with 

someone over something small. Miles hadn’t even asked what happened before stepping in front of me, shielding me. “I don’t care who’s right. She’s my girlfriend. I stand with her.” 

His voice was still ringing in my ears, every word searing into my heart. 

Now he wouldn’t even spare me a single chance to explain. It felt like a handful of fine needles pressing into my chest, a tight, bitter ache spreading outward. 

I said nothing more and lowered my gaze. 

The atmosphere grew awkward. The moderator moved on to the voting phase. 

There was almost no suspense. Everyone raised their hand to vote me out–including Miles. 

I became the first “dead” player of the night. 

In the following rounds, everything repeated like sone absurd loop. No matter what role I drew- villager, werewolf, or witch–I was voted out on the very first day. 

The reasons varied but always sounded the same: My speech was weak, my expression suspicious, my logic flawed. Sometimes they didn’t even need reason. All it took was someone casually

And Miles? Every time I was “killed,” he would give my hand a small reassuring pat… then turn right back to sitting shoulder–to–shoulder with Sabrina, whispering strategies with her. 

When she made a correct guess, he affectionately tousled her hair. When she was “killed,” he sighed dramatically and comforted her. 

Logan chimed in loudly, “Miles, with the chemistry you and Sabrina have, people might mistake you two for a couple!” 

Miles laughed and told him to get lost, but he didn’t deny it. 

Someone next to me tried to smooth things over with a smile. “They grew up together. They’ve always been like this. Don’t take it to heart, Chloe.” 

I curved my lips politely and said nothing. Take it to heart? On what grounds? 

A simple “they grew up together” was supposed to shut down everything I felt. If I got upset, I’d 

look like I had no sense of humor. 

When the moderator announced yet another unanimous vote against me, I didn’t sit in silence waiting for the round to end. 

Instead, I lifted my head, looked around the circle, and smiled. “Playing like this over and over is 

starting to feel a little boring.” 

The chatter in the living room quieted. A few pairs of eyes landed on me. 

Meeting those curious, amused, or surprised gazes. I kept my tone light. “Why don’t we make this interesting? Add a little bet?” 

I slipped off the diamond–studded bracelet Miles had given me and set it on the coffee table with a 

crisp sound. “I’ll go first. Next round, I’m betting this.”

1q4fluu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q4fluu/my_love_of_circuits/,My Love of Circuits,"I woke up on that day to my phone ringing, 3:00 am. It was quiet, the type of silence that makes you feel in danger. I answer the phone, Dr. Bruno Zaffre, the pathologist for my late wife.

Me and Frankie spent 35 years together, we met in university. It was true love at first sight. I didn’t think life could go to hell. And to the universe’s credit, it didn’t for a long time.

2 days prior to the incident, my wife died in a murder, supposedly a wrong place wrong time scenario. To say the grief has been a nightmare is a serious understatement. I wasn’t myself anymore. It was like a soulless skin walker had infested my skin. I’m finding it hard to put the emotional turmoil down into simple plain words.

I was crying when Dr. Zaffre called me. I imagined my late wives body lying in an old, rusted freezer.

“Mr. Smith? We noticed something… I can’t even put it into words. I understand that you’re grieving, so if you could send a family member over on your behalf, it’d be highly appreciated.”

I managed to find my words during my flowing tears.

“What?”

“Mr. Smith, we found an oddity in your late wives body, the reason I’m only giving you vague information because I DON’T KNOW” he replies, a hint of panic and rudeness in his tone. “Look, I’m not sure what else you want me to say, I need someone on your behalf to come to the morgue. Understood?“

My tears begin to dry. I’m left with a sense of curiosity, an elephant in the room which refuses to leave.

I obeyed the doctor’s orders, and called my son Kenneth. He was never one to portray emotion externally. Out of everyone I knew, he could handle the news. Somehow, he accepted my request. I assumed he thought it was something minor, I kept him a bit in the dark from that angle.

3 hours later, after tossing and turning, I fell asleep…

My sleep came to a halt at the sound of banging on my door. Yells filled my apartment, yells akin to the tortured souls of hell. I opened the door, Kenneth.

“Dad, we need to have a talk, NOW” he says. I accept as he walks in. He hands me a slab of pavlova, a juxtaposition of the news he would soon bring. I’m confused in the dark labyrinth of my thoughts.

“Who was she?” He asked, trailing off at the mention of his late mother.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t say anything, I was completely mute.

Kenneth wiped the sweat of his eyebrow, looking around cautiously. “

Remember how you always said Mum was a *machine* in medicine?” he asked, referring to her old job as a chemist.

I nodded along, I still didn’t know where this conversation would lead.

“Well, you were right”.

“…what?” I mutter.

Kenneth poured it all out. My wife? All flesh, but a metallic machine locked up where her brain should be. Her organs? Containing DNA from other people who went missing 50 years ago, people who vanished without a trace. Then, he dropped the final bombshell.

“And… how should I say this?”

I gave up at this point, nothing could shock me. “What?”

“There were no wounds, no sign of injury, nothing. As far as they’re aware, her brain. Never mind, her circuits, shutdown.”

I sat on the chair paralysed, I tried to ask a question, but nothing released from my chained up mouth.

“Shutdown, shutdown, shutdown, shutdown” my son repeated, his voice devoid of life. His words sent a chill down my spine. Within a second, his body fell to the floor, spasming everywhere. I yelled out his name, I was greeted with his body smashing into the glass coffee table in the room. Still, he continued to spasm across the living room. And then, the unthinkable.

A loud BOOM echoed across the space, his head was absent from his body, the walls painted red with his blood. Fragments of his old teeth were stuck in my leg, like shrapnel from a grenade. I collapsed onto the floor, screaming out his name. In the centre of the room laid a metallic box with wires circulating every side, some torn, presumably from his spasm fit. I stepped closer to the metallic box, picking it up. Kenneth’s words rang across my mind.

“All flesh, but a metallic machine locked up where her brain should be.” That’s what he said about Frankie. The metal box was a reminder of his words.

I let the box drop to the floor, a crackle of electricity singing its last tune when it hit the now bloodied floor. My family, my now dead family. A family of circuits.",3,1767599056.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

**Chapter** 1 

On Christmas Eve, my boyfriend, Miles Peyton, told me his group was short one player for a round 

of Werewolf and asked me **to** fill in. 

We’d been together for three years, yet this was the first time he ever brought me into his circle of 

friends. I even studied the rules in advance. 

When the moderator announced, “It’s night. Everybody close your eyes. Werewolves, **you** may open your eyes.” 

I shut my eyes. A moment later, I heard the faint rustle of clothing beside me. Then came a softer 

sound–wet, subtle, unmistakably intimate. 

It came from the direction where my boyfriend and his childhood friend, Sabrina Hayes, were 

seated. 

The sticky, ambiguous noise made something pull tight inside my chest. But the rules said to keep 

my eyes shut, so I forced myself to ignore the twist in my gut. 

When the moderator spoke again, “Witch, you may open your eyes.” I lifted my lids, adjusting to the returning light. 

Instinctively, my gaze moved first to Miles There was a smear of glossy red at the corner of his mouth–too bright, too slick, nothing like his actual lip color. 

My eyes shifted to the girl on his other side. Sabrina’s lips, usually neat and full, had a ring of cherry–red lipstick smudged around the edges. The color matched the mark on Miles perfectly. 

\*\*\* 

I curled my fingers into my palm and swallowed the words that almost slipped out. 

Maybe it was accidental. Maybe they bumped into each other. I told myself that, refusing to ruin my first time meeting his friends. 

The moderator continued, “Witch, this player died tonight. Do you want to save her?” He pointed at me. After a brief pause, I chose to use the antidote on myself. 

The game moved into the daytime round. The moderator rang the little bell on the table. “Morning, everyone. Last night was Christmas Eve.” 

Sabrina froze slightly. Her gaze flicked toward me, flash of open disappointment and surprise in her eyes. As if I should have been eliminated on the first night. 

The moderator went on, “We’ll speak in order. Miss Hayes, you start.” 

Remembering the noises I heard while my eyes were closed, I kept my tone steady. “I think the 

werewolves are Miles and Sabrina.” 

Chapter 1

“When my eyes were shut earlier, there were unusual sounds to my left, coming from where the 

two of them were seated.” 

My words had barely landed when a sharp, mocking laugh cut through the air. **It** came from Logan Reed, Miles’s longtime buddy. 

“Miles, does your girl even know how to play?**”** 

“Werewolf is about logic. Since when do outside noises count as evidence?” 

“If we’re going by that, my ears are sharp too. I heard her breathing get all heavy. Should I call her a 

werewolf for that?” 

“Yeah, if you can’t handle the game, don’t ruin it for everyone.‘ 

“Rules are rules. Don’t talk nonsense.” 

A few others echoed him with casual, thoughtless agreement. 

I tried to explain, but Miles suddenly pressed down on my wrist. His palm was warm through my sleeve, yet his voice sided completely with his friends. “They’re right. Werewolf has its own rules.” 

“You can learn as you go, but don’t bring in things that aren’t part of the game. It throws everyone 

off.” 

My lips parted, but the words stuck in my throat. 

A memory surfaced–back when Miles and I first started dating, I once got into an argument with 

someone over something small. Miles hadn’t even asked what happened before stepping in front of me, shielding me. “I don’t care who’s right. She’s my girlfriend. I stand with her.” 

His voice was still ringing in my ears, every word searing into my heart. 

Now he wouldn’t even spare me a single chance to explain. It felt like a handful of fine needles pressing into my chest, a tight, bitter ache spreading outward. 

I said nothing more and lowered my gaze. 

The atmosphere grew awkward. The moderator moved on to the voting phase. 

There was almost no suspense. Everyone raised their hand to vote me out–including Miles. 

I became the first “dead” player of the night. 

In the following rounds, everything repeated like sone absurd loop. No matter what role I drew- villager, werewolf, or witch–I was voted out on the very first day. 

The reasons varied but always sounded the same: My speech was weak, my expression suspicious, my logic flawed. Sometimes they didn’t even need reason. All it took was someone casually

saying, “**I** think she seems a little suspicious,” and everyone else would chime in like that was all the proof they needed. 

Under such blatant targeting, I finally saw the truth This wasn’t a game. It was a deliberate hazing ritual, wrapped neatly in the rules of Werewolf. 

And Miles? Every time I was “killed,” he would give my hand a small reassuring pat… then turn right back to sitting shoulder–to–shoulder with Sabrina, whispering strategies with her. 

When she made a correct guess, he affectionately tousled her hair. When she was “killed,” he sighed dramatically and comforted her. 

Logan chimed in loudly, “Miles, with the chemistry you and Sabrina have, people might mistake you two for a couple!” 

Miles laughed and told him to get lost, but he didn’t deny it.

Perhaps, 4-5 cups a day, if not more. However, a few absolutely unnecessary cups made me relapse (whether I thought I needed it to work better, or fit in social setting).

  
But around 6 weeks ago, I had some changes in my health, that made me deeply nauseous towards coffee. Those few weeks I've been sleeping waaay more than I wish I needed to, I also realized I can't stay up past midnight anymore without feeling totally exhausted. It felt both annoying and liberating. 

  
Now if I need a warm fuzzy feeling I settle for a cup of tea with a spoon of sugar, or sugarless cacao. 

  
I do feel better, freer. Though last week's apathy (one of the withdrawal signs) felt extremely hard to process. It helped me to partially recover mentally when I read Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning.

I went on a short trip with a member of our society to **Onakona** and **Ganga Maiya Pawan Dham**. It was not a long journey, but it felt meaningful and full of small joys.

We started our journey calmly, without any hurry. The road was quiet, and the surroundings slowly changed from busy areas to open land and greenery. While traveling, we started feeling hungry, so we decided to stop at a small roadside stall. That stop became one of the best parts of the day. We ate mirchi bhajiya and badda, freshly made and very hot. The bhajiya was spicy and crispy, and the badda was soft and filling. After eating, we had coffee. The coffee was warm and comforting, perfect for the road. Standing there, eating simple food and talking, made the journey feel more relaxed and enjoyable.

After that break, we continued our trip and soon reached Onakona. The village felt very calm and slow, far away from noise and stress. The air felt fresh, and everything around looked simple and peaceful. After reaching there, we decided to cook Maggi together. We prepared it ourselves and also ate some food we had brought along. Cooking and eating together in such a quiet place felt special. The Maggi tasted much better than usual, maybe because of the place or maybe because of the company.

We spent some time in Onakona, sitting, talking lightly, and just enjoying the moment. There was no pressure to do anything fast. Everything felt easy and natural.

Later, we went to Ganga Maiya Pawan Dham. As soon as we reached, the atmosphere felt calm and positive. The place was peaceful, and there was a sense of quiet devotion around. We spent time there praying and sitting silently. It felt nice to slow down and clear the mind. The calmness of the place helped us feel relaxed and content.

On our way back, we talked about the day and also spent some time in silence, enjoying the ride. Yesterday’s trip was not about big plans or famous places. It was about simple food, quiet places, shared time, and peace of mind. It was a simple journey, but it left me feeling fresh and happy.

I remember struggling a lot, years ago, to eat with friends, because I could never finish anything on my plate and felt deeply embarrassed about it. I'd avoid going to friend's houses incase they'd offer me dinner, I'd avoid restaurants, and I'd avoid birthday parties because it felt rude not finishing my slice of cake. Overall, I initially started to lose weight at ~13 because I kept feeling too full after only a few bites of food.

the past year or so has gotten way worse with my eating habits. For example, yesterday I had eaten nothing until 9pm where I ate 1 chik-fil-a sandwich and felt overwhelmingly nauseous, had an ache in my stomach, and kept regurgitating my food hours after I ate it. Same with the day before when I only ate 2 hotdogs.

The advice of eating smaller, more frequent meals doesnt help me because I can only stomach so little before I feel horrible, and one small meal is enough to make me feel debilitatingly nauseous for hours — I could never in a million years eat 5-6 small meals.

I also cant drink my calories because the same nausea and pain comes whenever I drink something (more so the pain, than nausea, but depends on how much I drink). For example today, I drank 4-5 sips of juice, then a few seconds right after, had an ache in my stomach that made me want to just bend over to make it stop. Ive tried almost all types of weight gain drinks, but because they always come out thick and dense, I'll vomit it back up after drinking a few sips, or struggle with nausea and stomach pain for 4 or so hours 

I dont really notice any foods that trigger these symptoms more often, but I know that tomatoes, most juices, coffee, and all spicy foods specifically are guarenteed to make me nauseous. Other than that, nothing else really seems to upset my stomach way more than the average food does. I also dont have any food allergies.

Ive tried a lot of things to fix it, I thought it was acid but taking antacids for months didn't fix it, thought it was my diet but nothing changed after removing different foods, tried eating at different times but nothing changed, tried eating slower but that actually made me eat less. 

Also, I struggle to stand for more than a few minutes before becoming light headed, shakey, or feeling my heart painfully beat out of my chest. Its been severely impacting my day-to-day life because I cant even do everyday stuff like cooking, cleaning, or showering, without passing out, throwing up, shaking, or extreme breathlessness and overall exhaustion. I also have completely stopped going outside to do activities because I physically cant bring myself to walk without taking breaks to sit down every few minutes due to feeling as if im about to pass out. and I'm 85% sure it's because of my weight — but at the same time im not too sure if my weight is that much of an issue by itself. I still get my periods extremely regularly, and besides pretty severe cramps, theyre normal — which I think means my body is still doing pretty normal? I saw a doctor a few months ago specifically about my weight concerns, and she only really asked me if I was still getting my period before concluding it was nothing serious. 

Even if my body is healthy, I still want to be able to eat food normally and gain weight. I love food and wish I could eat without the horrible feeling it gives me. And I absolutely hate how skinny my body looks and am extremely insecure about it. 

Sorry if I didn't give enough relevant information, its just that this is overall pretty simple — ""I have nausea, stomach pain, and early satiety when I eat. plz help. I'm skinny.""",8,1767598308.0,AskDocs,1,0.91,False

Not even in a “this is bad quality” way, just straight-up *nah, this ain’t it*.

I’ll start with mine:

* Wolfthorn: (Body Spray): I don’t hate Wolfthorn as a scent, BUT the body spray smells *way* different than the stick deodorant. Like… almost a different product. The deodorant is fine, the spray is just weird. Not terrible, just disappointing.
* Mambaking: I don’t hate it either, but it’s WAY too sweet for something that’s supposed to be part of the *Wild Collection*. I even have the body wash, but I barely use it. I reach for Dragonblast and Eaglefangs way more.
* Gentleman’s Cocoa + Brown Sugar (formerly Amber + Coffee): I genuinely don’t understand this one. People keep saying it’s basically Dragonblast AP/deodorant (before it got discontinued), but to me they smell NOTHING alike. I honestly don’t know how people buy this and think “yeah, this is great.”
* Raptorstrike: This one hurt the most. When it launched, I was HYPED. The name, the branding, everything. Then I smelled it and almost gagged. It’s insanely sweet and VERY floral. Like… this does not feel masculine at all, especially coming from Old Spice. Huge letdown.
* Rogue**:** (yeah, I know, don’t kill me yet) I have beef with this one for personal reasons. Rogue is literally MVP, my favorite scent ever. I spent around $150 on three body washes on eBay because they decided to discontinue MVP. Rogue smells *almost* the same, slightly changed, worse design, and to top it off the body wash is ONLY sold in Canada. That’s just disrespectful.

Anyway, that’s my list.

The past two weeks have been odd following my menstrual cycle (ended Dec 27th). My libido has been higher and I’ve had a strong desire to reproduce, even though we can’t afford it right now. Almost all of our friends are either getting married or expecting, and I think it’s influencing the behavior I exhibited this past week.

We had a lot of unprotected sex; once on Dec 27th,   again on Dec 31st, again Jan 1st and lastly Jan 2nd. I took levonorgestrel (Plan B) on Jan 1st and have been feeling awful ever since. I’ve kept a log of symptoms which include nausea, dizziness, abdominal cramping, insomnia, fatigue, acid reflux, breast tenderness, sore hips, sore back, insane bloating, and what feels like frequent urge to pee but hard to tell see I’ve been drinking 1 to 2 cups of dark roast coffee.

The acid reflux is new and just started today. I’ve also been itchy on my chest, shoulders, and back. And the bloating has been insane considering I’m fitness nut and maintain a 6-pack. I know I dranked lots of tequila and wine this week but this is beyond normal levels of bloating for me. I’ve had regular bowel movements after about 3 days of constipation.

And the anxiety has been wild. I’ve been anxious so much.

At first I worried it was either kidney or liver failure, now AI says it could be an ectopic pregnancy.

How long are these symptoms supposed to last? Has anyone had similar longer term side effects? ",0,1767598174.0,birthcontrol,2,0.5,False

Mikey barks as his goofy dog smile greets me. His black and white hips gyrate, making me grin.

“Babe, I’m home,” I call out. “Do we have enough food for Mikey tonight?”

Caleb finds me, then leans in for a kiss. I peck him on the lips and run my fingers up through his hair. He leans into my fingers with a smile.

“I think we should. I can check. I noticed the bin was running out.”

He unhooks himself from me, then goes to the closet and asks, “Did you get this bag?”

“What?” I question, coming up behind him. We stare at an unopened bag sitting next to Mikey’s food bin.

Mikey howls quietly, wagging his tail. His pleading eyes look up towards me expectantly. I always feed him when I get home from work.

“Wait, let me check my bank. I don’t remember buying this.”

“Neither do I.” I say, crouching down to the bag. I turn it over before cutting it open and sniffing, and say, “Doesn’t smell rancid. Expires 9/17/26.” It has a slight meaty stench that Mikey loves. Mikey licks my cheek and I laugh. “Okay, okay.” I scoop out some kibble. “Sit.” I command, then pour into his bowl. “Go ahead.” He chomps down, crunching as his tail swooshes back and forth.

Caleb says, “Jake, my bank is clear. Can you check yours? I don’t see a food receipt.”

I pull out my phone: 1/17/26. “Nope, sorry. It’s been a while since I went.”

“Huh. That’s weird,” he whispers.

“It’s like those glitch in reality videos you force me to watch.”

“Oh shit! It is! I should post about this. You’re sure you haven’t gotten it?”

I pull him into a hug, shoulders tense, saying, “No, babe. Glad we got it though. He still seems to like it. Look at him.”

We watch him chow down, slobber flying in all directions, and we both chuckle.

He stops eating before finishing the bowl, then goes to lie down on the couch.

Caleb and I look at each other as Mikey howls again. 

His tail thumps on the throw pillows.

I look back at my phone.

“Recurring Payment Authorized on 12/17 Callegrow Pesdin EST Anchorage AK $63.24”

“Have you seen this store before?”

His eyes comb over my phone.

“No…?”

He looks at his phone too.

“What the hell?”

He shows it to me.

The same authorization.

Mikey whines and his tail stops.

“What the fuck…” Caleb says, scrolling his phone.

I also check my history.

It’s there, every month on the 17th. Months and months.

A shiver runs down my spine as mist escapes my mouth.

The frigid mist seeps back in through my chattering teeth.

I snap my head back looking down.

It’s gone.

I cough, “Did you…?”

“Babe.”

He’s looking outside.

I follow his concerned eyes.

Mikey howls low with a grunt.

He lifts himself up off the couch and sulks onto my legs, pressing against me with his full weight.

I rub his head, then crouch down to him for a hug.

There’s nothing outside.

No lights.

No driveway.

No car.

No trees.

“The snow…” Caleb whispers.

“I know.” I swallow.

“There’s only snow.”

“It’s falling wrong.”

“They’re all moving in the same direction.”

“At the same time.”

I gaze at the window, my mouth agape.

Caleb swears.

“No service.”

“Who’d you call?”

“911. It only beeped.”

I tear my eyes away from the window.

“Caleb,” I say, standing up and pulling him close. “Look at me.” I try to catch his eyes. “Look at me, please.”

His eyes are welling up.

“We’re going to be okay.” I stroke his cheek, then kiss his lips.

Mikey howls differently, like a wolf—

“Mikey!”

We quickly turn to our dog.

His howl turns into an ancient laugh. 

The cackle creaks like old leather and groans like he’s in pain.

“I like the name Mikey. It’s odd, isn’t it? All this.” He rolls his eyes around the room. “And you call me Mikey.”

His voice scratches the inside of my head, making my eyes blur, like I’ve taken my glasses off.

“This is the one night I make you remember.” He says, gleefully. A tinge of sadness coats the words. “This is also the night I make myself forget.”

He licks his lips.

“Tonight, it’s your turn, Caleb.”

He launches himself at my husband’s neck.

I scream, wrenching my fingers between Mikey’s jaws.

Red warmth trickles down my spent, aching arms.

His flesh rips like a sweater being torn.

His neck cracks, and sprays me in the face.

Mikey’s body shivers.

His guttural voice whispers into my ear, “Thank you, Jake, for Caleb.”

I crumple to the ground.

He lies on Caleb’s chest and growls, “You’re next. See you next month.”

Blackness invades my sight.

Darkness and snow.

Falling in that strange, simple way.

All together.

An adoption form fills my mind.

Caleb wanted a copy.

Pesdin?

Where did they go?

Mikey howls.

Oh. Okay.

I smile, falling asleep.

—

My eyes slowly open. 

“Babe, it’s time to get up.”

I rub Caleb’s calmly rising chest. 

“Good morning.”

“Morning, babe.”

I kiss his shoulder and a whiff of copper meets my nose.

A single tear rolls down my cheek.

I shake my head with a cough.

I wipe my eyes, feigning rubbing sleep away.

Why was I crying?

“I’m going to make coffee, want some?”

“Of course. What kind of question is that?”

Mikey smiles his goofy dog smile.

The cold kitchen floor feels good under my feet.

Caleb calls out, “It’s snowing today. We should get some food for Mikey.”

“What was the name of the food again? I can order some.”

My phone reads 2/17/26. Did we already…?

I pour him a cup. My hand jerks away.

“Calle-something. Hold on.”

Mikey howls.

“Wait, there’s a bag in here already.”

I’m a 24-year-old guy (turning 25 this March). I’d describe myself as a bit introverted, but not too much 😅. I moved to San Diego last month for work. I originally came to the U.S. as an international student and was living/studying in the Bay Area before this. I now live in La Jolla near UTC. 

I work in tech and currently work from home, which means my social life has been… almost nonexistent. I’m trying to put myself out there more and meet people around the city , whether that’s grabbing coffee, exploring SD, joining activities, or just making some friends.

Some things I enjoy:

Trying new restaurants and bars

Hiking and being outdoors

Going to the beach (can’t swim yet)

Going to the gym every day (honestly the only thing keeping me sane 😅)

Finding new coffee places.

Sunsets (sunrises happen very early)

Playing sports: soccer, table tennis, field hockey, pickleball, and tennis (intermediate level)

I’m also very open to joining classes, group activities, or clubs, both to learn new things and to meet people.

1q4fc3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1q4fc3e/13_subtle_signs_an_introvert_likes_you_and_how_to/,13 subtle signs an introvert likes you (and how to notice them before it’s too late),"One thing I’ve noticed over and over, especially in loud, performative dating culture, is how often introverts get overlooked. Not because they’re uninterested, but because they don’t signal attraction in obvious ways.

They don’t flirt loudly. They don’t compete for attention. They don’t announce their feelings. So people miss the signs, assume disinterest, and move on. Then later comes the realization of “wait… that actually meant something.”

This post breaks down the quieter cues introverts use when they like someone. It’s based on behavioral psychology, attachment research, and what therapists and communication experts consistently describe. Not TikTok takes. Not “if they wanted to, they would.” Introverts *do* show interest. You just have to know how to read it.

---

## 1. They choose one-on-one time over group settings

Introverts recharge through depth, not crowds.

If they keep suggesting coffee, walks, or long conversations instead of group hangouts, that’s intentional. Laurie Helgoe, author of *Introvert Power*, explains that meaningful one-on-one connection is where introverts feel safest expressing interest.

This isn’t convenience. It’s preference.

---

## 2. They remember small details and bring them up later

When someone consistently remembers things you mentioned once in passing, that’s attention with emotional weight.

Research on attentional bias shows we retain more information about people we care about. Introverts tend to show interest through memory rather than display.

If they remember your preferences weeks later, it’s not random.

---

## 3. They ask questions that go beneath the surface

Introverts connect through meaning.

Questions like “How did that actually make you feel?” or “What got you into that?” aren’t casual curiosity. Susan Cain, in *Quiet*, explains that introverts seek depth over breadth.

If conversations with them feel more personal than usual, that’s a sign.

---

## 4. They’re slightly awkward around you, but not around others

If they seem composed with everyone else but a little fidgety or quiet with you, that’s nerves.

Attraction increases self-consciousness, especially for people who don’t rely on charm or extroversion. Research consistently shows anxiety rises when someone wants to make a good impression.

Silence doesn’t mean indifference. Sometimes it means restraint.

---

## 5. They make time even when their social battery is low

Introverts guard their energy carefully.

If they reply when they’re tired, show up after a long day, or check in despite being drained, that’s prioritization. Not obligation. Not politeness.

You’re worth the energy.

---

## 6. They share niche things they love

A playlist. A book passage. A random thought they normally keep to themselves.

Introverts express affection by letting you into their inner world. Sharing what they value is a form of trust. It’s not small talk. It’s intimacy.

---

## 7. They mirror your energy in subtle ways

They may not flirt physically, but watch how their tone softens when you speak. How their pace matches yours.

Studies on mirroring show we unconsciously sync with people we’re attracted to. For introverts, this shows up quietly rather than dramatically.

---

## 8. They linger instead of leaving right away

They don’t rush off. They stretch the moment. One more question. One more comment.

They’re not stuck. They’re choosing to stay.

---

## 9. Their laughter changes around you

Not loud or performative. Just easier. Warmer. More frequent.

Research in evolutionary psychology suggests laughter is a signal of interest, especially among people who are selective about when they express emotion.

---

## 10. They look out for your comfort

Introverts are highly attuned to overstimulation.

If they help you exit chaotic settings, check in on how you’re feeling, or quietly make space for you, that’s care. Not people-pleasing. Attunement.

---

## 11. They open up slowly and intentionally

When an introvert starts sharing personal history, fears, or goals, that’s significant.

Brené Brown’s work on vulnerability shows that selective emotional sharing is a signal of trust. Introverts don’t open up for attention. They do it for connection.

---

## 12. They’re quiet in groups but keep checking in with you

Watch the nonverbal cues.

Glances. Soft eye contact. Small smiles. Microexpressions matter. Research from UC Berkeley shows gaze patterns are one of the strongest indicators of unspoken attraction.

---

## 13. They include you in future-oriented comments

“We should check that place out.”  
“You’d probably like this book.”  

Introverts rarely jump ahead casually. If they’re imagining future moments with you, they’re testing whether you see it too.

---

These aren’t rules. People vary.

But if you’re noticing several of these signs from the same person, it’s probably not platonic. Don’t wait for a grand gesture. For introverts, subtle *is* the gesture.

And yes, sometimes when you walk away thinking “wait… was that something?”

I was born with a hare lip, the name Bubba Bo Crumpton and that black-haired Herman—my own twin brother—holding onto my heel as we exited the womb. The name and the hare lip, I somehow and at some point, which I cannot remember, determined to be the outworking of a grander theme in my life, a curse of sorts. It was late July in a hospital whose name I have never known in LeRoy, Illinois. And the beginning of it all, the infancy and earliest forms of my life, was slow like summers on the small corn farm where we lived.

My father worked nights pumping polyvinylchloride in a factory somewhere outside of Bloomington or Champagne or one of the bigger towns. And in the day time, he put me and my brother on his knees and plowed his small cornfield on a blue and rusted tractor, sweating through his denim shirts and white brimmed hat. He pushed stringy wads of sweet brown tobacco into his mouth, and brown spit dribbled into his stubble as he worked or stood over me and Herman as a black giant with the sun to his back telling us of ancestors Colonel Custer or Charlie Bowdre or recount how his own daddy’s daddy bought 55 acres with his life savings all those years before and how this was all that was left of it. He said we’d have it someday after him.  

One morning, he found the biscuits and eggs me and Herman had for breakfast coming up in sour, burning chunks through our noses and throats on the side of the goat shed. It was never clear how he knew, but somehow, he did. And our old man held his patch of tobacco down close to our green faces and laughed, saying,

“Probably won’t try that again, huh boys?”

When we’d groan at the table and push our plates away with our thumbs, he would lean over whichever one of us was full and speak softly, saying,

“If you think it’s too much to eat, baby, maybe we can make it less,” and with that, he’d cut the remaining margarine and syrup-soaked pancakes into small square pieces, offering them to us in that sweet, parental tone, saying, “What about that? That looks like less to me! Do you think we can get that down, buddy, huh?”

And most nights, after he’d get us boys clean and finish helping our sister with her first grade homework while drinking coffee before he headed out to work, he told us that he loved us and tucked us in while our grandmother watched from the hallway. He was our daddy. And he loved us. And he was always there for us.

My mother was not. Sometimes, though, we talked to her on the phone or visited her on Sundays in the funny hospital where she wore those orange pajamas with all the other women. And perhaps, this should have been a clear sign to me and my brother and newly toothless older sister, that something wasn’t right between her and my father, that my mother had problems. But this was the way things had always been for me in my life, the way it was. There was no other way for things to be that wouldn’t have been wrong in my mind. Besides, I was young. Shoot, we three were young. And I still struggled to understand why old people sometimes got sick and died of ammonia. It was a time when the girls in eighth grade, who helped us Kindergarteners with paste and cotton ball art projects, seemed to me to be beautiful, full-grown women—adults from my perspective though they were not yet 14 years old.

Our mother picked us up one afternoon. The three of us were sitting on the front porch in clothes we never wore, creased khakis and button ups for me and my brother Herman smelling like pomade and toothpaste, a white lace dress and bow for my sister. Momma was in that old blue Oldsmobile she used to drive, the one with the even bluer towels over the seats and crushed cigarette butts in the ashtray. It was our grandmother’s funeral—our mother’s mother—the yellow and hollow-boned lady who used to sleep on the couch while daddy worked and gave us peppermints and kisses with her prickly mustache that made our faces itch and read tabloids all day while she rattled ice cubes around in a sweating, small glass of watery diet Coke.

Momma told us that our grandmother was resting, that the graveyard was a place where older folks, and sometimes the younger, came to rest for the rest of time and be left alone. And so, it was. Even years after I knew better, there was somewhere inside of myself an envy for the well dressed and smiling folks with hands crossed over navels in long pillowed boxes, dreaming coolly under the sod and silty black soil. And I heard it was only right to respect the dead. That made sense. They were dreaming and who were we to disturb that? The headstones with their names only existed so the old dreaming people could be found—in case anyone ever needed to dig their grandmothers up out of the ground to ask them how she got the icing on her Italian cream cakes so perfect or where that old VHS tape with, “The Goonies” and “The Princess Bride” recorded off the TV was.",2,1767598045.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Vivian Cole. His ex–wife. 

“I just had a baby. ” 

“Mom’s here.” 

I started to speak, but he’d already snatched up his keys. 

“Jason!” 

The door closed behind him. 

His mom Sophie Vance appeared with hot cocoa, glancing toward the door. “Vivian has it hard, being on her own. Don’t be petty about this.” 

I want to argue a bit. 

“Just drink your cocoa.” She set it down hard on the nightstand. “Getting upset isn’t good for your 

recovery.”

I stared at hot coca and just left it there. 

Sophie was already in the living room, the TV blaring–some courtroom show she was obsessed 

with. 

The baby slept beside me, his face still wrinkled and red, just two weeks old. 

I’d had a C–section; the stitches were still in. 

The baby had cried four times last night, and I’d fed him each time. 

Jason slept in the guest room, saying he needed rest

Vivian. 

I’d been hearing that name for three years. 

Before we married, Jason told me they’d ended things amicably–no strings attached. 

After the wedding, I learned what that really meant 

Vivian’s car broke down. Jason got it running again. 

Vivian’s computer got a virus. Jason took care of it.

Whenever I complained, he’d say the same thing. “She’s alone. No one’s there to help her” 

I said I need someone to be there for me too. 

“You’ve got my mom,” he said, like it was enough. 

I looked toward the living room. 

Mrs. Miller sat there, munching chips and cackling at the screen. 

I picked up my phone, opened Instagram. 

Three days ago, Jason had posted a photo with the caption, \[So proud of my wife. Mom and baby doing great.\] 

It showed the baby’s feet. 

**I** scrolled down. 

A month before that, he’d posted again. Just two words in the caption, \[Happy Weekend.\] 

The photo showed two cups of coffee, one black and one latte. 

I drink black coffee. He drinks lattes. 

That day I’d been home, nine months pregnant. He’d told me he was working late. 

I checked the comments.

Nothing. The TV was too loud. 

I gritted my teeth, sat up slowly, picked up the baby and nursed him. 

Fifteen minutes later, he was asleep. 

Sweat drenched me; my incision felt wet and sticky 

I looked down. It was bleeding. 

I shouted this time. 

Sophie finally shuffled in. “What’s all the yelling about? You’ll wake the baby.” 

“The incision is bleeding.” 

She glanced down at it. “Just a little blood. Don’t be so dramatic. When I had Jason, I was back working in the fields three days later.” 

“This was a C–section.” 

“C–section or not, young people today are too fragile. That’s the problem.” 

She turned and left. 

I sank back into the bed, tears running down my face. 

It wasn’t just frustration. It was the pain.

1q4f3rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1q4f3rj/after_the_silence/,After the Silence,"# On the wedding anniversary, Serena's husband was with his mistress who was giving birth.

The next morning, Serena saw the news.

EXCLUSIVE: Billionaire Julian with his newborn child.

The abandoned anniversary setup still waits there, untouched.

Her phone vibrates again on the counter.

Julian's name appears.

She stares at it.

The screen lights up, then goes dark. Lights up again. He is calling back to back now, the way he does when he senses control slipping.

Serena does not answer. She lets it ring until it stops.

A text follows.

\[We need to talk. Please.\]

She almost smiles.

Serena lies back on the bed and stares at the ceiling again.

Ten years of marriage did not prepare her for this moment. But it did teach her one thing.

Survival.

She reaches over and turns her phone back on, just long enough to text one person. Her attorney.

\[We need to talk today.\]

————————

Julian comes home like nothing is wrong.

That is the first thing Serena notices.

The penthouse door opens with its usual quiet efficiency. No rush. No hesitation. Just the soft click of locks disengaging and the familiar sound of leather shoes on marble. He moves through the space like he owns it. Like he always has.

Serena stands at the kitchen island with a glass of water she has not touched. The candles are still lit behind her, their flames smaller now, stubbornly hanging on. Wax has pooled and hardened along the edges. The air smells faintly sweet and burned at the same time.

Julian loosens his tie as he walks in, already halfway into his apology.

""I know,"" he says, voice smooth, warm. ""I lost track of time.""

He sets his phone down beside his keys. Screen face down.

That detail lodges itself in Serena's chest.

He does not look at the table. He does not comment on the candles. He does not ask why dinner has gone cold or why she is standing instead of sitting.

He leans in to smooch her cheek.

Serena shifts just enough that his lips brush air.

Julian pauses.

Not long. He recovers quickly. He always does.

""Hey,"" he says gently, like she is a problem that needs careful handling. ""You okay?""

She takes a sip of water. It tastes flat.

""Fine.""

One word. Calm. Neutral.

Julian studies her face. His gaze lingers for a second longer than usual, like he is running a quiet assessment. Serena meets his eyes and gives him nothing to work with.

He exhales, the tension easing from his shoulders. Decision made.

""Long day,"" he says. ""Board wouldn't let go of the Atlas expansion. Everyone wants guarantees that don't exist.""

He smiles at her like that explains everything.

Serena nods once.

She does not ask questions. She does not comment on the time. She does not mention the missed calls.

Julian steps around the island and pours himself a drink. He chooses whiskey. He always does when he wants to feel in control. The ice clinks softly in the glass.

Serena watches his hands.

They are steady.

That matters.

""You didn't have to wait up,"" he says. ""We can do this tomorrow. I'll make it up to you.""

There it is.

Automatic forgiveness. Deferred accountability. He assumes she will let this slide the same way she always has.

Ten years of muscle memory is hard to break.

Serena turns slightly, resting her hip against the counter. She crosses her arms loosely, casual enough that it does not look defensive.

""Tomorrow's fine.""

Julian blinks. He did not expect that.

He takes a sip of his drink, eyes still on her. ""You sure?""

She nods. ""I'm sure.""

The silence stretches.

Julian clears his throat. ""I should probably shower. I smell like airport coffee.""

He waits, like he expects her to tease him. To tell him he smells fine. To close the distance between them.

She does not move.

""Go ahead,"" she says.

Julian hesitates, then nods. He walks past her, his shoulder brushing hers lightly. The contact sends a sharp, unwelcome jolt through her body.

She holds still until she hears the bedroom door close.

Only then does she exhale.

Serena turns toward the dining table. The place settings look wrong now. Too deliberate. Too hopeful. She reaches out and blows out the nearest candle. Then the next. One by one, she extinguishes all of them, watching the smoke curl upward before disappearing.

She does not clean up.

She leaves everything exactly as it is.

From the bedroom, she hears the shower turn on. The sound is grounding. Normal. It is strange how ordinary everything feels when something enormous has already shifted.

Serena walks to the window and stares out at the city. Her reflection floats faintly in the glass, superimposed over lights and movement and lives that have nothing to do with hers.

She thinks about the voicemail again. The woman's voice. The calm certainty. The way she said the word baby like it was a fact, not a confession.

Julian has not asked her why she is quiet.

He has not asked if something happened.

He has not asked if she is upset.

Those omissions are louder than anything he has said.

The shower turns off.

Serena straightens her posture, instinctive and practiced. She turns as Julian reenters the room, towel around his waist, hair damp, skin still flushed from the heat.

He looks good. He always has. Tall. Controlled. The kind of presence that fills a room without effort.

He smiles at her. Familiar. Easy.

""You're still up,"" he says.

She lifts a shoulder. ""Couldn't sleep.""

He nods, crossing the room to retrieve his phone. He checks it quickly, thumb moving fast. Serena watches the screen light up. Notifications bloom and vanish just as quickly.

He locks the phone and sets it back down.

No voicemail check. No missed call reaction.

Another mark against him.

""Want me to order something?"" he asks. ""You didn't eat.""

She turns fully to face him now.

This is the moment she could confront him. Demand answers. Say the word baby out loud and watch his face crack.

She chooses not to.

Not yet.

""No,"" she says. ""I'm not hungry.""

Julian's brow furrows slightly. ""You never skip dinner.""

She meets his gaze. ""People change.""

He laughs softly. ""Since when?""

Since tonight, she thinks.

Instead, she says nothing.

Julian steps closer. His voice drops, gentle. ""Did I mess up that badly?""

There is something almost sincere in his tone. Almost.

Serena considers him carefully. She thinks about the man she married. The one who promised transparency. Partnership. Loyalty.

She thinks about the voicemail sitting on her phone, untouched.

""You're late,"" she says simply.

His relief is immediate. Visible.

""I know,"" he says. ""I said I'm sorry.""

She nods. ""You did.""

Another pause.

Julian reaches out, brushing his thumb along her forearm. The gesture is intimate. Familiar. Designed to reconnect.

Her skin prickles.

""Come to bed,"" he says. ""We'll talk in the morning.""

Serena gently steps back, out of his reach.

""I need some air.""

Julian's hand drops.

""Now?"" he asks.

""Yes.""

He studies her again, this time more closely. The confidence in his posture shifts. Something cautious creeps in.

""Serena,"" he says, voice low. ""What's going on?""

She walks past him toward the balcony doors. The night air rushes in when she opens them, cool and sharp. She steps outside, the city noise rising to meet her.

Julian follows, stopping just inside the threshold.

She grips the railing, knuckles whitening.

""Did you know,"" she asks casually, ""that some hospitals automatically notify next of kin when a child is born?""

Julian stiffens.

The change is subtle, but Serena feels it like a pulse beneath her fingers.

""I don't see how that's relevant,"" he says.

She turns to look at him.

His face is carefully neutral. His eyes are alert.

""Just something I read,"" she says.

He exhales slowly. ""You're reading strange things tonight.""

""Maybe.""

They stand there, the city sprawling beneath them, the distance between their bodies suddenly vast.

Julian forces a smile. ""You're tired. Let's not do this right now.""

""Do what?"" she asks.

""Whatever this is,"" he says. ""You're looking at me like you're waiting for something.""

I am, she thinks.

She steps closer, stopping just short of him. Close enough to see the faint line between his brows. The tension in his jaw.

""Julian,"" she says quietly.

""Yes?""

""Is there anything you want to tell me?""

The question hangs between them.

He could still salvage this. Admit something. Frame it as a mistake. Give her a version of the truth she can work with.

Instead, he shakes his head.

""No,"" he says easily. ""Nothing you don't already know.""

Serena holds his gaze.

She hears the lie settle into place.

She nods once, as if accepting it.

""All right,"" she says.

She turns back toward the city.

Julian lingers for a moment, then retreats inside. She hears the doors close behind him.

Serena stays where she is, letting the night air steady her breathing.

She reaches into her pocket and pulls out her phone.

The voicemail is still there.

She opens it, stares at the timestamp.

Then she locks the screen and slips the phone back into her pocket.

Inside, Julian moves around the penthouse, the sounds of drawers opening and closing drifting through the glass. He hums quietly. Comfortable. Certain.

Serena tightens her grip on the railing.

One question forms in her mind, sharp and unavoidable.

She turns back toward the doors and walks inside, her steps measured.

Julian looks up from the bedroom doorway.

""Yes?""

Her voice is calm when she speaks. Precise. Surgical.

""Julian,"" she says, ""who is the woman who just had your baby?""

I pull over to park and I hit the curb, only hurting my car (not really, nothing happened, it just made a noise lol). I got out to check that my tire was fine, and this dude standing there made a comment about it, just being friendly. Everything was fine, so I got back in my car to wait for my friend, I decided to get out again to double check my tire, then I called the man over for a second opinion. He said he thought everything was okay, so I, again, got back in my car to wait for my friend. Then all of a sudden, seemingly out of thin air, this chick appears. She walks up to the car in front of me (which I was nowhere close to), looks at the back of it, glances at the front of my car, shakes her head and mumbles, them walks to the driver's door. She flips something off, maybe the sky, Idk, but definitely wasn't aiming her fingers at me. She takes off, and I see her holding her phone out the window like she's recording me, and she gives me a death stare. She was saying something, I couldn't quite make it out but something along the lines of ""typical..."" and drove off. I walked back up to the same man and asked if he heard what she said, and he said no but she was definitely going on about something. If she thought I hit her she'd definitely ask for my info??? Right?

I'm not making this pose because of this isolated incident; back in April I was watching the sunset there and I witnessed this woman who was clearly experiencing psychosis have a total freak out on a family and some other people before eventually being arrested. She looked ""normal"" (clean clothes, groomed), drove a nice car, and had a dog with her. The following night, another person got arrested in the same spot. Then today, after I left, my friend sent me a video of a ton of firetrucks and ambulances out there. I'm curious if this is just because of the type of crowd Sunset Cliffs/OB tends to attract because I'm familiar with that, I'm not NOT used to coming across people with mental health issues, I've grown up in cities with pretty prominent homeless populations and have interacted with them quite frequently, I've been around people who are on drugs, so I'm just curious why I might be frequently having these experiences with seemingly sober/""normal"" people acting super out of the ordinary.

But then I found out that the ticket includes sky lounge access.  I did not purchase this that I recall.  Unlimited wine, beer, energy drinks, juice, coffee, buffet, and a live chef making Bun Thang to order a la and omelette station at a resort.  

I paid $130 for two checked bags totaling 40kg and my carry on. That's incredible value for money as far as I'm concerned, even if there was a delay.

***Memory transcription subject:*** **Negotiator Gress, Krev Consortium**

*Date \[standardized human time\]:June 20, 2157*

The entire room was filled with a tense silence as we watched the log obviously made by a much younger Captain Reissig. To say I was shocked at his both ability and apparent willingness to create a virus to wipe out what was essentially a subspecies was an understatement. Aside from the horrifying implications of the video being that Starfleet could create such weapons and *choose* not to use them there was something else that had caught my attention from the video in regards to the younger version of Captain Reissig.

*The eyes.*

There was something all too familiar with that empty look across his face in that log, his eyes that no matter where they looked seemed to be staring off into nothingness. The look of someone who has been pushed far past their limits and there was nothing left for them to look forward to or fight for, a person that has nothing to lose or fear anymore. I knew the look because for **\[months\]** that was what I saw in the bathroom mirror when I got ready for the day after Kendala was killed, I was only pulled out of that mental fog when I realized I had to be present for Lecca.

 “Let’s thank the Yotul Technocracy who though what I assume is another blatant act of espionage have decided to transmit me at the lowest point of my life in order to dirty the name of Starfleet and the Federation.” Captain Reissig said with a forced evenness to his voice. “You asked for context, yes? Let’s give you some context as for why I was driven to create this virus that was never made use of.”

Captain Reissig was now leaning slightly forward in his seat with his hands clasped together in front of him on the table as he addressed the delegates with an incredibly intense stare. While his attention seemed to be shifting between all of them the default one he seemed to be looking at was General Radai who was the most leery of these newcomers, especially after this transmission that I had *not* been made aware of. Dr.Vensa seemed almost unbothered by this entire situation, she sat in her seat as respectful and calm as ever as her captain spoke, there was not even a hint of surprise on her face as the video from the transmission played. Commander Alanajo on the other paw seemed to be ever so slightly out of sorts, either due to the tension in the room or from the transmission, either way the winged mammal had a much more rigid posture now than before.

“Lets see… lets see…” Captain Reissig muttered to himself before turning his attention to delegate Riccin “I assume you have read over the historical files on how the War of the Federations ended and the major points of said war?”

“Yes we have.” He responded. “They were most… intriguing.”

“Alright, this log was created during the final march to Aafa, the Kolshian homeworld.” Captain Reissig said before taking a deep, shuddering breath. “I was aboard the *Discovery* after being rescued from the Yulpa on Grenkela. Do you know anything about the Yulpa Ascendacy or their religious practices?”

I racked my brain for a moment to try and think of if I knew anything of that species or government but I came up with nothing. Our first and only source of information on the OAF was from tapping into their comms network a century ago for a brief period. After that there have been no attempts at intelligence gathering as it was deemed too risky. 

After the delegates had responded in the negative of their knowledge on these Yulpa Captain Reissig then proceed to speak about how these Yulpa were religious zealots who believed that the living sacrifice of predators would bring them favor with their god, the more intelligent the predator and the more suffering inflected would in turn bring them greater favor. He then in great detail began to tell a story that started with him being captured on a colony by Yulpa cultists and Kolshian augments, he started to describe the *torture* he endured in the days it took to reach the Yulpa homeworld as they attempted to extract information from him. 

While I have seen and experienced *horrific* things due to my job as a negotiator and have done well at compartmentalizing mentally there was something that just bypassed this barrier due to the fact it was a primate that had gone through such things. It was difficult to look at Captain Reissig as he described in detail the harrowing experience he had faced before creating a virus to wipe out an entire portion of an enemy species. I had noticed that delegate Riccin was having similar troubles as well due to imagining a primate undergoing such horrors, General Radai on the other claw had no such problems as he listened to the human with rapt attention as he absorbed every spoken detail.

“After I came to I was locked inside a cage that was located within their Grand Arena, they were going to sacrifice me which according to their customs would have involved setting me on fire and impaling me with spears. Once I got out of the cage I created an improvised explosive device using the power cells of weapons I had *acquired* off of some guards.” Captain Reissig said in that chillingly calm voice. “My plan was to distract the Yulpa using the device which I had set on a timer to go off after I snuck out of the building. Given my concussed state I somewhat underestimated the yield of the device and the entire arena collapsed in on itself. Shortly thereafter I found myself being chased though the woodlands by Yulpa cultists seeking revenge and Kolshain augments.”

As he proceeded to tell this story he spoke of how there was a rescue team sent down to collect him while forces dealt with the Yulpa fleet in orbit. He talked about a creature that seemed too outlandish to even exist, a *changeling* whose entire species were able to mimic the forms of others. Apparently this changeling was working with the Kolshians in order to enact revenge against the family of Captain Reissig, in doing so had killed a close friend of his while mimicking his own form.

*He saw himself take the life of someone he considered a friend, I could not imagine living though something like that*.

“I say this not to gain your pity but to tell you of the horrors that I had gone through in order to drive me to create the virus referenced in my log.” Captain Reissig stated. “What should be noted is that this virus was never deployed, all research materials and virtual samples were confiscated by Starfleet Medical and classified after the battle of Aafa. I am grateful that Starfleet chose to not use this weapon as the creation of this virus is already my greatest shame, its use would have only compounded such disgrace.”

At the end of that last part of his speech Captain Reissig began to sit fully upright once again, no longer leaning forward. During that entire time Dr.Vensa had kept that same neutral expression that she had been maintaining for what had felt like ages while Commander Alanjao had remained facially neutral but his ears were vastly more expressive. The delegates took this opportunity to talk amongst themselves once again as they went over this story of the Human, as they talked right in front of him as if he were not present I noticed that a slight look of irritation started to grow across his face.

“You are not a doctor or a geneticist yet you were able to create a virus that would supposedly be able to wipe out an entire subspecies on your own.” Said the Trombil delegate cautiously. “Does your Federation deploy such weapons frequently enough that you have perfected the creation of virus bombs?”

Instead of Captain Reissig responding it was Dr.Vensa, I had noticed that just for a moment before she spoke a look of what looked to be anger flashed across her face but just for a moment.

“The United Federation of Planets most certainly does not make a habit of using bioweapons, as evidenced by the fact Starfleet refused to deploy the V-456 virus.” Dr.Vensa said as she locked eyes with the delegate. “As for the ease of the creation of this virus, it was a modified retrovirus that we use for certain gene therapies. With the glaring weakness to the immune system of the augments even a first year medical student at the academy could have created something similar with the resources available in an average sickbay.”

With that last question being answered the room was filled with a very awkward silence as the medical officer stared down the Trobil delegate. After a few moments delegate Riccin coughed and broke the silence.

“Well… that puts things to rest about that transmission.” He said to the Starfleet officers. “Lets… move on shall we? What shall we discuss next…”

Needing to keep the conversation flowing and improve the mood of the room for these talks to be successful I decided to speak up.

“There is the Founders race that’s coming up. I talked about it with them on the way here and they seemed fascinated with it.” I said to the delegates. “Perhaps they could enter the race as a show of wanting to participate in our own customs and celebrations. It was after all implemented as a way to foster cooperation between the member species of the Consortium, I think it should extend to our friendly neighbors as well.”

This seemed to relax everyone in the room, after going from the rather *intense* subject from several moments ago to this must be reliving. I noticed that the Starfleet officers took much less rigid postures at this change in conversation.

“There are rules and regulations to the Founders Race.” Piped up the Smigli delegate. “That ship they have in orbit is far too large, even if they did follow all the other regulations.”

“We have smaller craft in our shuttlebay.” Captain Reissig said. “If we are allowed to participate in this race we could use one of them. If you send over the requirements to the *Hyperion* I can have my people check for any of our craft that fit the requirements or make any modifications needed.”

**\[Time advance - 1.5 hours\]**

“I believe that covers everything for the time being.” Delegate Riccin said to Captain Reissig “If there is nothing else you wish to discuss for now I believe you may be on your way.”

After the rather *intense* start of these talks things had actually gone rather smoothly once I got the conversation flowing once again. In the end it was agreed that Starfleet would be allowed to participate in the Founders Race as long as the craft they used was within regulations and that an observer went along to make sure the rules were being followed as all craft were required. Something that had shocked me was that Captain Reissig said that he did not care about the prize money and that if his team won then for the money to just be given to the runner up.

After talking about the race there were a myriad of different topics broached that in all honestly required little of my input as Captain Reissig and his officers seemed rather proficient in diplomacy. In the end it was decided that they would stay for the next **\[4 days\]** so that we may learn as much about them as we can and for them to learn about the various species of the Consortium. Captain Reissig even agreed to send out the cultural and historical databases of the Federation to the Consortium for the general public to have access to; these people seemed open to sharing just about everything.

Part of these cultural exchanges involved members of the senior staff of the *Hyperion* visiting planetside and engaging in conversation with both the public and local leaders. Dr. Vensa had even offered to speak at a local school in the district and answer questions made by the local school children. They had also agreed to give the delegates a more in depth tour than the very brief one I received of the *Hyperion*, something I was invited to as well so I could have a more complete view of their operations.

“There is one thing actually.” Captain Reissig said from his seat. “It is in regards to the shore leave of my crew. Just something that should not have to be clarified but needs to be just in case.”

The delegates had extended an offer to Captain Reissig to the use of Avor for shore leave for his crew, they had even offered to send a case of credit chits so that members of his crew would have a stipend to use when they were on the surface. The captain readily accepted, stating that his crew had been hard at work and deserved a chance to relax.

“Of course.” Riccin stated. “What is it that needs to be cleared up?”

“Many members of my crew are of species that once belonged to the Orion Arm Federation, I want to be assured of their safety and fair treatment while on shore leave. I don’t want any surprises about them being detained for no reason just because a police officer felt like it.” Captain Reissig stated. “The same goes for the singular Arxur member of my crew.”

It was General Radi who responded to Captain Reissig. The General had been rather quiet after Captain Reissig told his story of escape from the Yulpa and had not spoken up much.

“I will make sure my security forces know that fair treatment of the visitors for the race will extend to members of your crew captain.” The General said as he stared at the human. “If there are problems with any Resket disobeying that order you can come to me directly. At times like this discipline must be maintained.”

“That is acceptable.” Captain Reissig stated. “If that is all, we will be on our way so that we can make the needed preparations.”

After that we were all dismissed and allowed to leave the complex, it did not take long for us to move past all the security checkpoints and get to ground level in order to exit the tower. Right after we had exited the building we were intercepted by a Trombil who handed off a case of credit chits for the captain to distribute to his crew as they went for shore leave.

“Unless there is anything else for us to discuss I believe this is where we part ways until tomorrow.” Captain Reissig said as we stood in the middle of the plaza. “Take care of yourself, Gress.”

“You too, captain.” I responded. “I think that despite the *rough* beginnings of those talks that this is a future between our peoples.”

With that the human gave me a small nod before tapping his badge which in response made some sort of clicking sound.

“Reissig to *Hyperion*.” He said out loud. “Three to beam up.”

I was confused at what he was saying into his badge which I assume was some sort of communicator as well. I stumbled back in shock to the gasps of the onlookers as the three Starfleet officers were enveloped in some sort of bright blue light that made a humming noise, as the light faded they were nowhere to be seen and I was left in the middle of the plaza.

*Well, what am I supposed to do now?*



***Memory transcription subject:*** **Ensign Lysith, Starfleet**

*Date \[standardized human time\]:June 20, 2157*

“Ensign Lysith to my ready room.”

After hearing the order from the comms system I stood up from my console at the sensor station and made my way across the bridge. While the first contact team had been back for about two hours at this point and Commander Alanjao had taken his place on the bridge Captain Reissig and seemingly sequestered himself to his ready room, occasionally summoning various officers to speak with him in person.

That was not to say that we were uninformed of what happened on the surface, our Drezjin first officer while unable to go into certain specifics had informed us that the talks went well and that the Krev had invited us to stay for a few days so we could learn more about one another. Commander Alanjo had also informed us that as a reward for our recent hard work we would be having shore leave with the first batch of officers slated to begin theirs in only a few hours. Apparently in two days there was to be some sort of race that we were entered in that we would be using one of the shuttlecraft for as well, I was pretty sure I heard mention of an engineering team making sure the craft was within regulations for said race.

Once I made my way across the bridge and to the door to the captain's ready room I took a deep breath to calm myself and made sure to stand up straight at my full height. The captain had never called me to his ready room and aside from that dinner I was invited to I had only said a few words to him my entire time aboard. I would be being dishonest to myself if I did not admit if I was nervous at being called to speak to him privately. I pressed my claw to one of the buttons at the control panel to sound the chime and barely a moment later I heard a voice from inside.

“Enter.”

I pressed the correct button on the control panel to open the door and stepped in at a brisk pace with my hands behind my back in order to stand at attention. The captain's ready room reminded me of the one I had seen on *Voyager* when I had toured it at the fleet museum, directly in front of me was the desk where I saw the captain sitting with a smile on his face. Off to the side was a small raised sitting area with a couch and coffee table in front of a large window that took up most of the wall. One of the things I noticed as I stepped forward was a shelf the seemed to hold various awards, metals and trophies that the captain must have accrued over the years, I could identify the Christopher Pike Medal of Valor as well as several from various Federation worlds such as Colia, Vulcan, Earth and Rontar.

“Captain.” I said in an even tone as I approached his desk. “You wished to speak with me.”

Captain Reissig studied me for a few moments before he let out a small chuckle. As I got a better look at his desk I noticed that there were a few small decorations he had, a small holographic projector that was showing various different images that due to me being in front of the desk was at the wrong angle to look at. On the back wall behind the desk there were various weapons as well that had been mounted and secured, some of them I recognised such as the Andorian *Ushon-tor* which was used for ritual combat or the Rexelian *Tril-don* which was in essence a glorified fishing spear used for ceremonial purposes.

“At ease ensign, before you sprain something.” Captain Reissig said in a joyful tone. “You’re not in any sort of trouble, on the contrary I have good news for you.”

Captain Reissig then motioned for me to sit across from him, but not before letting out a breath that I had seemingly been holding in. Despite it always being the case I always found it somewhat amusing that I would be taller than most authority figures in my life, I was taller than most of my teachers by the time I started middle school and that was before my final growth spurt. Given that fact that the Captain was not a particularly tall human I probably would have been taller than him then as well.

“That is good to hear.” I stated “Does this have something to do with your visit to the surface?”

“It most certainly does.” Captain Reissig responded “I believe Alanjao told you of the Founders Race in 2 days and the Krev invitation for us to participate. Well one of the delegates had asked me to indulge them in me being a pilot for the race, something about how the first race was done by high ranking members of each of the militaires of the Consortium and them wanting to extend the tradition.”

“Most interesting Sir.” I said as I thought over what he said. “But what does that have to do with me?”

“Well I have been hearing nothing but great things in regards to you from Commander Iskma as well as any other officer I have asked.” Captain Reissig said with a smile. “You can turn this down if you want of course but as a reward for your hard work I was thinking you could be my co-pilot on the *Hummingbird* for this friendly competition. What do you say?”

Excitement started to flood my entire body the more the captain spoke and I could barely sit still in my seat. I could feel my tail slowly moving side to side in joy as it stuck out of the hole in the back of the chair as well.

Teach my Sister discipline by Extreme Measures.

Context:
Hi I'm 27M, Breadwinner, Eldest Son.

Our Dad was non existent, so I ended up taking the responsibility and became the main provider of the Family.

I have two sisters, kambal sila. Let's calm them A1 & A2, they're already 19 Years Old and just started College.

A1 is smart, with High Honors, inherited my talents and skills in Cinematography. She also got my OCD.
Mauutusan, Strong Attitude, Got alot of Friends. She also sells korean noodles online just to add more cash into her allowance. Also helps out at a school canteen run by my Mom. Her Boyfriend is pretty great too. She also does Summer Jobs para dagdag pera.

She wanted to do Education so I enrolled her into a State University in our city which is one of the best when it comes to number of Education Board Passers.


A2 on the other hand - WALANG TALENT, WALANG TALINO, WALANG CLEANLINESS. SOBRANG SAMA NG UGALI, UNGRATEFUL PIECE OF SHIT. DOESN'T RESPECT MY MOM, MY GRANDMA. 

Pag inutusan, nag dadabog at nagagalit. Pag pinagsabihan siya pa matapang. 

Siya din yung tipong ""talk first think later"". Yung gagawa agad ng dahilan para di mautusan pero ang bobo ng mga palusot.

Sobrang bobo din pumili ng boyfriend, laging may kaaway or drama sa circle of friends niya.

Pagnag aasaran, pag napunta sa kanya ang asaran ay nagagalit agad at nag mamaoy.

She's also fucking unappreciative when it comes to things, tinitake niya for granted.

Example: when I'm still earning less I made Ice Candy and sell it in my workplace, also sold instant coffee para makaipon ng pera pambili ng laptop tig isa silang dalawa.

I gave it to them during their debut as a gift, I also made sure they experience a grandeur debut dahil I always believe na they should have the best experience the life can offer. Kahit di ko naranasan ang mga yun basta sila goods.

After a year, yung kay A1 shiny parin ang laptop and malinis. Yung kay A2 dami nang dents and crack sa frame.

Binilhan kodin sila ng I-Phones during their graduation sa Senior High.


Si A2, gusto mag Civil Engineering. Pinakuha ko siya ng entrance exam sa same State University ni A1.

Di siya pumasa.

Kaya pinasok ko siya sa isang Private University na mahal pero keri lang.

Yung grades niya puro GG.
Yung drawings/plates niya ampanget.

Kahit anong invite sa kanya ni A1 mag summer job, ayaw niya talaga kasi tamad ampota.

Kaya ko pa palampasin lahat ng yan, pero yung di ko kaya is yung disrespect niya sa kay Mama and Lola.

Grabeng sacrifice ang ginawa ng dalawang yan para samin, tapos yan lang ang igaganti ni A2 sa kanila?

Kung maka-asta parang siya ang Diyos sa bahay.

Na hi-highblood ako pag naririnig kong sinisigawan niya sila Mama at Lola.

Ang iniiwasan ko, baka sa sobrang stress at galit ay biglang ma stroke si mama or lola dahil lang sa kanya.

Kami lang na pamilya niya ang ginaganyan niya, pero ibang tao ang bait niya. Uhaw din kasi sa Validation from outsiders. Tiktok lang at Facebook ginagawa sa bahay, bantay ng buhay ng ibang tao.

Nasa point narin ako minsan na gusto ko na siyang physicalin pero di yan gumagana tsaka babae kasi.


Kaya this is my Plan.

I plan on stopping all my support sa kanya. I'll confiscate all the gadgets and resources na na eenjoy niya.

If she wants to continue college, she can work and support her self.

My Mom did it, I did it so pretty sure she can too.

She's already 19 and hindi na Minor. She is fully capable of working na.

I tried to warn her about it but she shrugged it off saying she don't care.

**TL;DR (long post ahead):**  
I (25F) have been in a two-year long-distance situationship with a man (28M) who never committed or made plans to meet. Recently, after moving countries, I reconnected with someone new (30M) who is present, consistent, and emotionally available, and we’ve been seeing each other for about a month. I want a committed relationship but feel torn between letting go of the long-term emotional attachment and moving forward with someone new. I’m unsure if it’s too soon to have the “what are we” talk with the new guy, whether I should tell him about the old situationship, and how to finally let go of the past.

**Full Story:**

I (25F) met someone, let's call him Sky (now 28M) from an app about 2 years ago, September 2023. We hit it off and we started to talk every single day, despite being in a whole different country. As times goes by we spent more time together, from texting, calling, video calls, movie nights and more, and so I won't lie, I did grow feelings for him. However, he can be very nonchalant at times, as if he want me in his life but not to certain level. We had the talk as well about this, about feelings and being committed because I was being clear since the very beginning that I am a committed-relationship type and so when we had the talk I confess to everything and he was just there, listening and when its time for him to talk he was unsure about his feelings, but he said stuff like ""But its you i spent time with, i call everyday"" ""You're smart, and kind, and pretty and I like spending time with you"" he said stuff that doesn't clarify his feelings towards me so I told him to be sure of it first and then he can call me again once he is sure, if not, I asked him to stop calling me. 

Few days later he texted me and called me and said nothing about what we discussed, and my stupid self just go along with it and so we just keep going, doing our usual stuff. 

Fast forward a year later, around October/November 2024, there was still no progress between me and Sky, we talked about meeting each other and him visiting but there wasn't any progress on that too, so I tried to suppress my feelings and slowly stop investing so much of my time for him. And one night in October/November, just out of fun and/or boredom, I downloaded Bum\*\*e and set to Travel mode to one country (in which I was planning to travel to after the new year) and I matched with this man, let's call him Atlas (now M30) and we started talking, and when he found out that I am in a whole different country, right away he told me that due to past experience he can't do LDR and he won't be sure of it but then he said ""We can try, there is no harm to it"" so then we started talking and spending more times too, in which I told him that i'll be traveling to the country in a few months. However, after new year 2025, I had to cancel my plan for some reasons and I told him about it. We still talk and spend time but then Atlas started to bring up the whole LDR situation and he told me ""I do like you but I cant do this, i am too traumatized to be doing this again"" and so I understand and we both agree to stop talking for the best of both sides. 

And so I still am on the situation with Sky even after everything. 

Fast forward to May 2025, I visited the country where Atlast live, and I decided not to contact him because I was just visiting and I think it will be harder to get to meet him just to leave again and back in the loop. So i didnt informed him that I was there. 

And I am still on whatever it is with me and Sky. 

And in November 2025, I decided to move to the country where Atlast at (and no, not because he lives there hahaha, it just been the plan and I finally did it). I flew in the beginning of November 2025, and when I landed, right away I was busy with settling down; place to live, work, documents etc. I wasn't thinking about Atlas at all because I thought he blocked my number already, and it has been a long long time so I just didn't reach out. 

Still in whatever situation Im in with Sky. 

by the end of November, I couldn't sleep that night and was just scrolling on instagram, and I saw a post that was liked by Atlas and thats when I realized that he did not block me everywhere. So, with a lot of nervousness, I decided to send him a DM just saying Hi and he responded the next morning with full excitement and asking me to send him a VN or give him a call for life update and I just simply said we can do it over a coffee and his response was immaculate, he was very excited to find out that im here and right away he told me we can meet that evening and he told me to get ready that he will pick me up. 

and so we met, such an incredible moment it was, to see his excitement. And turns out he took me to this nice restaurant that has my favourite foods and at some point he called it our first date. 

and we went for 2nd, 3rd, 4th date after that, include a concert we went to and after that we stayed together for the next 2 weeks while sitting his friend's apartment who were traveling at that time. By this point he has introduced me to his friends (in which everyone reaction was like ""Ohh its herr"" ""oh finally we meet you"") and he also let me speak to his sisters in which we get along quickly. I had the best times ever when im with him, we spend time together, playing games, watching movies, tv show, cooking, going out and everything.

But then Sky started to notice that I haven't been very present (replying his text late, didnt call him, or only call for short period). 

I know, it has been only a month for me and Atlas and it has been 2 years on the other side with Sky. But, Atlas is here, with me, spending his time and energy, showing effort, treating me kindly with gentle and care and I can see how genuine he is. 

Is this too fast? Im thinking to have the talk with Atlas very soon about where is this going because again I need clarity, as I only do committed relationship, and it has been soo long I am not in one, i felt like Atlas woken up this feeling that I haven't felt in such a long time, im kinda scared too, but I started to like him so much day by day, but there is Sky as well. 

Here’s where I’m struggling:

* It’s only been about a month with Atlas, but it feels real and grounded.
* It’s been almost two years with Sky, but it’s always been uncertain and long-distance.
* I want a committed relationship.
* I don’t know if it’s “too soon” to have *the talk* with Atlas.
* I also don’t know whether I should tell Atlas about Sky at all.
* Emotionally, I know I probably need to let Sky go, but it’s hard after investing so much time.

**My questions:**

1. Is it reasonable to have a clarity/commitment conversation with Atlas this early?
2. Do I owe Atlas full transparency about Sky?
3. How do I let go of someone I never really had, but spent years emotionally attached to?

I have posted about this before, and the verdict was that I am a dormat. However, this was before the person responded to me explaining themselves after I said my feelings the first time (so basically an update).

So basically I was childhood best friends with this person, known them for almost my entire life. It has been a tradition to celebrate birthdays together. She moved out of state two years ago. During that time, she had a destination wedding, then a couple months later a wedding here, and then a couple years later court married all to the same person.

She keeps bringing up herself (I'm not initiating or inviting myself) for almost a year straight she wants me to visit her and will check her schedule, but she never does so I assume it won't happen which is fine.

On my birthday she texts me that she is coming to my state and she says that we will celebrate my milestone birthday dinner when she comes down. She gets here, and we meet for bubble tea and I mention it, and she says something kind of evasive about going to different houses. She also anounces at the coffee shop that they are getting legally married.

The next day, she texts me that she has plans to go to a VR thing, and invites me to go with a group of people, while giving me an hour to decide so ""she doesn't miss out on the tickets."" I see on the website, it is cheaper if more people are in the group so I assume that is the only reason I am last minute invited.

I tell her I can't afford it right now and thank her for the invitiation, and ask if the group was meeting for lunch and she says they might she will let me know. The day of the VR event, she gives me an hour notice that they are meeting for lunch. Mind you, the place they are meeting at is half an hour away so that gives me a 30 minute buffer.

Press 1: If I would be okay to step out and collect the parcel in person  
Press 2: If I wanted them to assign another delivery-executive (i.e. One who was not handicapped)

This got me thinking about gig workers' New Year's Eve strike against 10-minute delivery pressures - and that viral video of a rider walking 1km into a gated Bengaluru villa.

Denizens on social media were aghast over the utter disregard for basic dignity of labour, but the fact remains: Corporate ‘leaders’ champion Diversity & Inclusion (DEI) in their offices, yet balk at small ""inconveniences"" like stepping out of their gated cocoons to pick up their orders.

Riders face unpredictable traffic hazards, security guards, bouncers, algorithmic penalties, and long treks while we sip coffee in AC comfort clicking away our orders.

1q4epyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/thane/comments/1q4epyn/need_ideas_for_innovative_veg_food_carts_for_a/,Need ideas for innovative veg food carts for a mini open-air food court at Ghodbunder Road,"Hey everyone,

I’m developing a small open-air food court right outside my ice cream parlour and I’m looking for suggestions on what kind of vegetarian food carts I should invite to set up here.

The idea is to create a cosy, family-friendly space with 1 cart = 1 cuisine, so each vendor has their own niche and the overall mix feels exciting rather than repetitive.

Pav Bhaji cart is already operational.
From my side, the only desserts & beverages are: Ice Cream Sundaes and Milkshakes (no separate dessert or beverage carts).

Important limitations
Completely veg only (no egg, no meat, no seafood).
No beverage-only concepts (tea/coffee/juices/sodas, etc. are out).
No dessert-only carts (since ice cream is already covered).

So I’m mainly looking for:
Savoury snack / meal-style carts
Strongly street-food friendly concepts that work well in an open-air, casual setup
Things that pair well with families coming for an evening outing and then probably ending with ice cream

One concept I really like (but would need a vegetarian spin) is the Bring Your Own Bag (BYOB) chips idea. Customers bring their own packet of chips, the vendor slits it open and loads it with toppings inside the same bag. In many places this is done with shawarma or chicken, but I’m imagining:

Veg BYOB: chips + assorted veggies, beans/chole, corn, cheese, olives, jalapeños, different sauces, etc. – basically a portable chaat/nachos-style meal in a bag.

This is just one example to show the style of ideas I’m after: fun, customisable, Instagrammable, and easy to eat in a casual outdoor seating area.

What veg food cart concepts would you personally love to see in a small neighbourhood food court?

Any unique twists on Indian veg street food, global veg snacks, fusion ideas, DIY/customisation concepts, etc.?

Would love to know if you’ve seen something similar work well in India already.

Location is Ghodbunder Road, Thane, target audience is nearby families and young crowds looking for an evening snack + ice cream.

Would love to hear your most creative veg cart ideas!",1,1767595859.0,thane,0,1.0,False

1q4ens9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1q4ens9/how_to_make_small_talk_interesting_the_psychology/,How to Make Small Talk INTERESTING: The Psychology Behind Better Conversations,"I used to think small talk was pointless torture. Standing there like an idiot, brain scrambling for something to say while the other person looks equally uncomfortable. ""So...nice weather?"" Kill me.

But here's what I figured out after diving deep into communication research, psychology books, and way too many podcasts about human connection. Small talk isn't the problem. It's that nobody teaches us how to do it properly. We're all just winging it with the same tired script we've been using since high school.

The good news? This is actually fixable. I've spent months researching this from books by FBI negotiators, improv coaches, and social psychologists. Turns out there's actual science behind interesting conversations, and it's not rocket science.

## 1. Stop asking dead end questions

Most people default to questions that lead nowhere. ""What do you do?"" ""Where are you from?"" These are conversation killers disguised as conversation starters.

Instead, ask questions that invite stories. Replace ""What do you do?"" with ""What's keeping you busy lately?"" or ""What's the most interesting thing that happened to you this week?"" You're giving them permission to talk about literally anything, not just their boring job title.

The book **""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss** (former FBI hostage negotiator, bestseller that sold millions) changed how I think about questions entirely. Voss explains that the best questions are open ended and make people feel heard. This book is insanely good at teaching you how to guide conversations naturally. After reading it, I realized I'd been interrogating people instead of talking to them. Best negotiation book I've ever read, hands down.

## 2. Follow the energy, not your mental script

Your brain probably has a list of ""acceptable small talk topics"" it cycles through. Weather, weekend plans, traffic. Boring as hell.

Pay attention to what makes someone's face light up. If they mention they just got back from hiking and their whole demeanor shifts, don't pivot back to your planned question about their commute. Dig into the hiking thing. ""What trail did you hit?"" ""Are you training for something or just love being outside?""

This is called ""conversational threading"" and it's how you turn small talk into actual connection. You're not following a script, you're following their enthusiasm.

## 3. Share something slightly vulnerable or weird

Nobody remembers the person who said everything was ""fine"" and ""good."" They remember the person who admitted they burned their breakfast because they were stalking their ex on Instagram (hypothetically speaking).

You don't need to trauma dump, but sharing something imperfect or unexpected makes you human. ""I'm good, just trying to convince myself that buying a plant will somehow make me more responsible"" is infinitely more interesting than ""I'm good, how are you?""

The app **Ash** has this cool feature where it helps you practice authentic communication through AI coaching. It's weirdly helpful for building confidence in being more real during conversations. The prompts push you to drop the performance and just be honest about what's actually going on. Makes you realize how much energy we waste trying to seem ""normal.""

## 4. Use callbacks and inside jokes

If someone mentioned earlier they're obsessed with their cat, bring it back up later. ""So did Mr. Whiskers approve of your outfit choice today?"" Callbacks show you were actually listening, and they create this mini shared history even in a short conversation.

This is straight from improv comedy technique. The podcast **""Conversations with People Who Hate Me""** explores this brilliantly. Host Dylan Marron talks to people who've sent him hateful messages online, and he uses callbacks constantly to build rapport even in hostile situations. The show demonstrates how remembering small details transforms strangers into something closer to acquaintances, sometimes even friends.

## 5. Make observations instead of asking questions

""You seem like someone who has strong opinions about coffee"" is more interesting than ""Do you like coffee?"" Observations give people something to react to. They can agree, disagree, or take the conversation somewhere unexpected.

This works because it shows you're paying attention to them as a person, not just filling dead air. You're noticing their personality, not collecting data points.

## 6. Embrace the weird tangents

The best conversations don't stay on topic. Someone mentions they hate cilantro, suddenly you're debating whether it tastes like soap, then you're talking about genetic taste differences, then somehow you're discussing whether free will exists.

Don't try to ""get back on track."" There is no track. Let the conversation breathe and go wherever it wants.

**""The Art of Gathering"" by Priya Parker** (conflict resolution expert, TED speaker with millions of views) breaks down why the best interactions happen when we stop trying to control them. Parker argues that meaningful connection requires letting go of rigid structures. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social situations. The chapter on dinner party rules alone is worth the read.

There's also **BeFreed**, an AI learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it creates adaptive learning plans based on whatever communication skills you're working on. The depth is customizable, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning feel less like a chore. Worth checking out if you're serious about leveling up your conversation game without carving out huge chunks of time.

## 7. Actually listen, don't just wait to talk

This sounds obvious but most people are mentally rehearsing their next comment while the other person is talking. Your brain is going ""ok cool story but wait until they hear MY thing.""

Try this: after someone finishes talking, pause for one full second before responding. That pause forces you to actually process what they said instead of just reacting. It also makes them feel heard in a way that's surprisingly rare.

The **Finch** app has daily check ins that train you to be more present with your own thoughts, which weirdly translates to being more present with others. When you're not constantly in your own head, listening becomes way easier.

## 8. End conversations while they're still good

Don't wait for the awkward fizzle. If you've had a good exchange, exit on a high note. ""This was actually fun, I gotta run but let's not wait another year to do this again.""

People remember how conversations end more than how they start. Leave them wanting more instead of desperately searching for an excuse to leave.

The reality is, nobody is naturally amazing at small talk. It's a skill you build by trying different approaches and noticing what lands. Some conversations will still be painful, some people just won't vibe with you, and that's fine. But when you stop treating small talk like a chore and start treating it like a game where you're trying to find something interesting about this random human, it gets way more tolerable.

1q4ekl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1q4ekl3/the_months_leading_after/,The Months Leading After,"Just a thing I wrote. Maybe someone else feels similarly? It's about trying to get into a relationship and then move on. I feel so stupid sometimes, not even a month after the guy did it to me, he was with someone else, publicly making out. Meanwhile, I find someone who is perfect, but I can't trust him anymore. Anyways- here it is. I know it's corny, I haven't properly written in a while, and I'm mostly just using it as an exercise for my emotions. 



	I don’t know why I’m afraid of him,

	When he's been nothing but perfect to me.

  


He’s been my friend since I got here freshman year, and by the looks of how things are going for both of us, it looks like we’re going to be graduating together, too. He said he’d make sure of it. Nobody left behind, right?



I know he’s my friend. I know that for certain, and he would never do anything to hurt me, but then why am I so afraid?



I think of us spending time together, looking into his dark brown eyes, making a stupid joke, or trying to break the ice, because once you’ve crossed a particular line with someone, it’s hard to go backwards into being *just* friends again.



When I’m with him, it makes me want to imagine a future. Not a far-off future, but a future nonetheless. I can envision myself in my two-bed-one-bath apartment that I share with my best friend, cozied up on the couch by myself, trying to come up with a study guide for my students I TA, or maybe writing up a bill to make the school a better place. I can imagine the lamp to my side, gently illuminating the living/dining room, the candle on the coffee table, with its warm vanilla scent, and the TV my roommate brought, playing a shared playlist of our favorite study songs. I’ve always been a sucker for classical music, and with the amount that I play it, I think she has started to take a liking to it.

There, in that moment, when everything is *just right*, I can imagine myself getting distracted by a buzz in my hoodie pocket, seeing his notification, and smiling. I can imagine putting down my papers and readjusting my position to reply as if it were life or death.



I can also imagine lying on my bed with him next to me, typing something down on his computer with a sense of urgency while I browse on my phone for nothing in particular. 



What would happen after he’s done typing?



The truth is, I’m afraid of the nighttime. 



It sounds childish, and it may be. But the nighttime is when people do things, and they think they can get away with it just because it’s dark outside.



The darkness is uncertain, and people will say they didn’t know what happened or can’t remember.



In the dark, while your whole life is changing, everyone else may just be asleep, waking up the next morning as if nothing had gone wrong at all.



Because the worst part about nighttime is that no matter what, the sun will always rise again, and it won’t be waiting for you to get back on your feet. The sun continues without you, and soon the night becomes the only comfort you have.



You start to hide in it. You start feeling like all the bad that you carry can be hidden away here, too. 

Felt here. 



By day, I accidentally brought it up to my brother, and I had nothing to say about it at all. He asked for details, and I gave a few basics. He asked for a photo, and I showed him his username and profile picture. It was so easy for my brother to look at him. I hated how it wasn’t for me. 

He asked me why I wasn’t more upset. I was. Not during the daytime.

Maybe not even during the night.



My upset and hurt manifested itself into fear, taking good people like my friend that I made freshman year, and making me terrified of having them in my space at night.



You never know what people are going to do at night. After all, the man who made me afraid was my friend, too.",0,1767595351.0,sexualassault,1,0.5,False

Tell us about a time when paramedics have been the literal angels that you'd walk through fire for. 

(This brought to you after reading the post about paramedics with 'superiority complexes'--I love our paramedics and want to share a bit of that with the class because there's never enough uplifting stories here anyway). 

I'll go first: Most recently the crew was tasked with transferring a patient from NH who really did not need to be in hospital, and it went against all of their ACD's, but the nursing staff were given no choice but to call 000. Since we were nearly ramping, they cheerfully allowed us to conduct our assessment on stretcher, then transported the resident home again when the FACEM deemed the patient safe. It's the little things.

Another time I was doing a double shift in triage and one of the ambos knew that i was Fading Fast (it was near 3am) and when he was between jobs he went to the servo and got me a coffee. Granted, they were then tasked with a job which meant by the time he delivered it it was stone cold, but it's the thought that counts.

For some context: I am a college student who lives very far from home/my parents. I struggle with chronic depression. We are not really a 'christmas' family, we normally just pass around well wishes and small gifts. I normally get fuzzy holiday socks or a blanket (I absolutely LOVE anything warm and fuzzy). 
This Christmas was absolutely insane. My mother got me an eyeshadow I mentioned was pretty back in JULY, plus three others she thought were nice. My father bought be a fancy coffee drink (I am the only member of the family who likes coffee, the others all recoil at even the smell). They both are making an effort to keep the kitchen packed with apples just because I love apples. 
I keep trying to express how grateful I am and how much this all means to me, but it's not really working. My mother smiles and says of course she remembers things I like. My father just laughs and tells me to stop making it weird. 
I just feel so loved and seen at this moment. I can't tell any of my friends because they all have bad relationships with their parents, so I figured I'd share with the void that is the internet.

TL;DR- I'm depressed and I love my parents",1,1767595134.0,family,1,1.0,False

We’re building a digital games reselling and top-up marketplace, similar to G2G and Z2U, but focused on the Middle East, where competition is significantly lower than in Western markets. ( literally 5 platforms only, and only two known good so far )

What we’re raising

* Total raise: $10,000
* Minimum investment: $1,000
* Return: 15% revenue share, calculated on gross revenue
* Cap: 3× return, future equity possible

Current status

* We have a license from Saudi Arabia Goverment
* Platform %95 Ready, we need to link stripe as no payment gateway in Saudi Arabia is supporting digital game products ( yeah it's really weird i couldn't understand) However, also adding over 300+ products
* copy pasting our legal pages, takes 2 mintues, we've already made them

All of the above will be completed within one week\*.\*

Early traction:

* Started as a Discord-based store 500+ members, possible customers
* Scaled into a standalone website
* 30 orders completed in 3 days ( payments were made through Paypal, which is very limited ) after that orders were closed due to thight proccesing budget.
* \~$200 in cash revenue,
* Orders were temporarily paused due to limited operating capital

Use of funds

The $10K will be used for:

* Yearly hosting plan + VPS
* Operating order flow and liquidity
* Contracts with small content creators

Budget breakdown:

* 70% — Buying products from vendors (resale inventory)
* 1% — Running operations
* 2% — Legal compliance (company setup in us)
* 27% — Paid Marketing

Why not friends, family, or saving more?

We’ve already self-funded and raised what we could internally. The remaining $5K isn’t affordable for our circle right now, and waiting longer would mean losing momentum and demand. Orders are already coming in, and we don’t want growth to stall due to cashflow constraints.

Structure & transparency

Her and I became very close very quickly. We would hangout often with friends, vent, and even cook dinner together. She was such a beautiful woman, inside and out. We both came out to each other, but we always kept it as friends. As the days went on I started to look at her differently. She works across the street from me at a cafe, so I’d often visit just to see her. She was still the beautiful girl I had always known, but different. I was captivated by who she is and everything she does. As someone who struggled with insecurities due to my sexuality, for once in my life I had felt proud of who I was. I remember thinking to myself that if these are the emotions I was born to feel for another woman, that I should cherish it. I was never able to confess to her as she had left a toxic relationship a few months prior and I wanted to give her time to heal. 

Unfortunately her and I don’t talk as much anymore, but I think about her often. I still work across the street from her, but I’m too nervous to grab a coffee. The way I felt for her was unlike anything I had felt before, man or woman. I’m not sure I want to feel that way again lol. It’s the kind of yearning that only brings pain with it. Anyways I just needed to vent because I haven’t really came out to my friends.

**TeMiriCe** e un spațiu de coworking la origini, unde înainte să luăm frâiele de management la începutul anului, noi eram chiriași, de vreo 7 ani.  
De când am redeschis spațiul pentru public, la începutul anului trecut, **TMC** (yeah we’re cool, abreviem) a devenit:

1.  **HQ** pentru câteva comunități, printre care: **Molecula3D**, care e comunitatea locală de artiști 3D, și **Timișoara Game Developers**. 
2. Event space pentru orice chestie ne-a trecut nouă (și nu numai) prin cap, meetups de game dev, round tables de game design, prezentările noastre despre RPG-uri, miniature painting workshops, avem cumva și o grupă de teatru care își ține eventurile la noi. 
3. A rămas spațiu de coworking, we like our crowd, chill & kind people are here, and more are always welcome.

So it’s the New Year again.

It’s January again. 

I will set my resolutions again, and I will forget them again. 

I’m waking up again. Drinking coffee again. Going to work again. Being an adult again. It should feel new, but actually nothing has changed. The air is cold again. I’m still the person with the same feelings again. 

The snowflakes are slowly falling on the ground, and I’m thinking: 

It’s gonna be my birthday again. And yours too. Christmas is not too far away. And the cakes, the champagne, the family members gathering up at the same time for once. A special moment that happens every year, is in fact, a routine in disguise. 

And the more years you live, the more you realize: 

*Aren’t we doing this all over again?*  

Yes you’re getting one year older.

Yes you’re different than before. You try new foods, you read new books, discover new bands, and start a brand new job. 

But you’re still the same. *Something’s* constant, it’s a part of you and it will never change. Still, everyone’s trying the best they can, not to be like their old selves.

\----------------------------------------

What’s the point of doing it *again*? 

Is there *a* *gain*? 

Well…Repetition can lead you far. Let’s say you used to enjoy drawing so much. But you stopped after middle school. Why? Your self-esteem has been crushed. You think you’re not good enough. 

Today, you start picking up a pen. You defeat your creative block, not only once, but 365 times a year. It's a routine, it's familiar, you enjoy it again. You do it over and over again. 

What do you think will happen? 

You will look at the world through the eyes of a child, again. ",1,1767594425.0,theshyreveal,0,1.0,False

I work with a small team building an app called **Belong**, and we’ve just launched in Bangalore. The whole idea is to make it easier to meet people and feel part of a community here.

On Belong, you can easily:

* **Join or create local events** (coffee meetups, hikes, book clubs, or add existing events so users can join in)
* **Monetize your skills** if you want to host something (like teaching yoga or a skill workshop).

Most profiles are verified, so you know you’re talking to real people.

Belong is already used by over a million people worldwide, with thousands of meetups happening every week, and we’re excited to start building that same energy in Bangalore 🌆

You can check out the app from the link in the comments, or find us on Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/belong.app](https://www.instagram.com/belong.app)

We do food and shows but don't gamble much, and we brought kids. I don't come often, maybe once every 2-3 years. 3 nights Jan 1-4. We are in our 50's, kids 9 and 15.

We stayed at the Luxor (comprised of $125 room, $50 resort fee per night), I've never stayed there and have wanted to stay in the pyramid since it opened when I was in high school, so finally, bucket list item checked off. Yes, the pyramid rooms are a bit down on their luck, and our room had NOTHING (no coffee machine, no fridge, not even a minibar to my surprise, not even a pen, okay it had wifi and a TV) but it had nice views inside and out, killer water pressure, was quiet, and we had good nights' sleep. Also, when you stay in a place like the Luxor, at least the bottled water at the store is going to be $6 not $12. It was fine. Pool was closed, no hot tub, but fitness center was small but quite nice. Weights, kettle balls, machines, treadmills, cycles, ellipticals, yoga mat, foam roller, water machine, clean, next to the spa so spa-level cleanliness. At $50 resort fee it better be.

We saw Blue Man Group ($95pp, back quarter of a small theater), O ($250pp, center, first 8 rows), and Penn and Teller ($150pp, first 6 rows). All costs include taxes and fees. This was basically me showing my kids some of my favorite shows of my past and also finally catching P&T for the first time. I thought P&T was for older kids but dang people brought their little kids which was fine but not sure they knew what was going on. I only brought the teenager. BMG, people kept walking into the show or from one seat to another throughout the performance, which was annoying as hell, I guess I should've gotten seats closer to the stage so I didn't have to see endless people walking in front of me but really thought in a small theater I didn't have to pay to be up that close.

Bellagio (for O) was a madhouse. Could barely walk around it. Saw one fountain show (audio too quiet) and split. Also, getting there was terrible because you have to enter from the Strip instead of some nice back alley like for Luxor's Self Parking (at least the back alleys for Bellagio were not on our Google Maps in, we did use them on our way out and I swear it told us to drive down some pavement with arrows pointing the opposite way so not sure what we drove was legal...). I nearly had a breakdown thinking I was going to miss the show while trying to get there from Luxor having given myself 40 minutes to get there. I'm sure there's a Bellagio access hack out there but too late.

Spring Mountain Road is our dining place of choice and we went there 1-2 times a day. I decided to choose one shopping plaza (Seoul Plaza) and hit almost every restaurant in there, ranging from a fancy omakase sushi place (Kabuto, $300pp inc tip) to some great curry (Zen, $30pp, appetizers, drinks, tip). Good bang for buck compared to Strip, IMHO. 

This meant renting a car ($80/day, I originally posted on this reddit asking if renting a car was necessary). And, in the end, it just added so much flexibility. There was rainy weather during our long weekend and having the car meant we could choose the day and time to go out to Red Rocks (don't forget to reserve your vehicle entry and buy national parks access). Probably not useful in the summer, but it was also just a quiet place to sit and wait if all four people didn't want to do the same things. Staying at Luxor meant we could park under the same parking fee ($20) at all the other MGM properties for 24 hours (ex. Bellagio). 

We were ready to lose $300 over this long weekend but actually only lost $50! Luxor has a $5 blackjack table but it mainly has beginners. Still, a good place to get your legs back.

Hit Area 15. Actually just wanted to visit Omega Mart but in the end did Pass 3A ($150pp) and did not regret it, esp since we had kids. Having 2 days made it less stressful in trying to hit all the things on the pass since there could be lines for things. Saturday was a madhouse, lines, crowds, but Sunday much calmer. John Wick Experience was pretty cool (and we've only seen the first movie), Illuminarium chill, VR games family-friendly, Omega as expected (and we had high expectations). Lots of psychedelic stuff and loud electronic music. Like taking your kids to Burning Man but without the dust and RVs and weird adults.

So that's our trip report with kids, almost no gambling, eating off Strip, and splurging on shows and Area 15.",8,1767594348.0,vegas,1,0.9,False

I came into the kitchen around 7:45AM, my cast already starting to itch and the whole left side of my body sore like I’d gone ten rounds with a semi-truck.

The sun was shining through the curtains, warm and golden, like nothing was wrong. Like nothing had ever happened.

Mom was at the stove, poking at eggs she clearly didn’t want to eat. Her hair was pulled into a low, messy bun, and she had that tight smile on her face. The one she wore when things were bad, but she didn’t want me to know they were bad.

Dad sat at the table, already showered and dressed, black coffee in front of him. His work boots were beside his chair, unlaced. He hadn’t touched his toast.

Tori sat across from him, pushing a spoon through a bowl of cereal and scowling like we’d personally ruined her life.

“Hey, kiddo,” Mom said when she saw me. “Hungry?”

I shrugged. “Not really.”

I slid into the chair beside Dad and winced as I bumped my cast against the table.

He glanced over, then reached out and gently adjusted my plate so I wouldn’t have to move it.

“How’s the wrist?” he asked.

“Sore.”

He nodded. “Doctor says it’s a clean break. You’re lucky.”

I didn’t feel lucky.

I felt like something had reached out of the dark and tried to pull me back in.

Tori let out a loud sigh and crossed her arms. “So what—he just gets to stay home all week now?”

Mom shot her a look. “Victoria.”

“What? I’m just saying—some of us have finals next week.”

Dad sipped his coffee. “The doctor gave him a note for the rest of the week.”

Tori rolled her eyes. “Of course he did.”

“He has a broken arm,” Mom said, her voice thin.

“And a head full of ghosts,” Tori mumbled under her breath.

“What was that?” Dad asked, his voice sharp.

“Nothing,” she said, but she didn’t look at me. Just stared at her spoon like it had personally offended her.

Dad sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I have to go back in today. I told Jim I’d cover the shop until at least Friday.”

Mom nodded quietly.

“We can’t leave him here alone,” Dad added. “Not with his arm like that.”

“I’ll stay,” Mom said. “I’ll call out.”

“No.” He shook his head. “You’ve already missed two shifts. I called Mom this morning. She’s gonna come over and sit with him today.”

I froze.

“Grandma?” I asked, trying not to sound too twelve about it.

“She’ll be here by ten,” Dad said, like that was the end of it.

I looked at Mom, hoping she might object—but she didn’t. She just smiled, soft and sad. “You’ll like the company. She’ll probably bring muffins.”

Tori snorted.

I just stared down at my plate, appetite gone.

I didn’t want muffins.

I wanted someone to believe me.

After everyone left, the house went quiet.

I watched through the front window as Dad backed the truck out of the driveway, Mom in the passenger seat, Tori slouched in the back. She gave me one last dramatic look before disappearing behind the glare of the window glass.

I listened to the garage door groan shut.

Then silence.

Just me.

I turned on the TV in the living room and laid down on the couch, cast resting on a pillow. The cartoons were bright and loud, but they didn’t do much to quiet the rest of the house. The attic was still up there. Still waiting.

I glanced at the clock. Grandma wasn’t supposed to be there for another hour and a half.

I’d just started zoning out to Pokemon reruns when—

Knock knock knock.

Three quick knocks at the front door.

I sat up fast, heart racing.

Not because I was scared, but because no one ever knocked that early unless it was a delivery or something bad.

I peeked through the peephole.

Three kids stood on the porch.

Zack, Taylor, and Blake.

My friends.

Well—sort of.

We ate lunch together, played Super Smash Bros. whenever someone had a sleepover, and texted more than we actually talked in class. They weren’t the most popular kids, but neither was I.

Zack had a backpack slung over one shoulder and was holding a manila folder. Blake stood with his hands in his hoodie pockets, his hair a mess like he barely made it out of bed. And Taylor—short, sharp-eyed, in a jean jacket way too big for her—had a Yoo-hoo in one hand and a silver pack of Pop-Tarts in the other.

I opened the door with my good hand.

“Duuude,” Taylor said, eyebrows raising as she looked at my cast. “You actually broke it?”

“No way,” Blake muttered, leaning closer like he was gonna poke it. “You fell out of the attic?”

“Yeah,” I said, stepping aside. “You guys wanna come in?”

They didn’t need a second invitation.

They crashed into the living room like we did every Saturday. Zack handed me the folder.

“Ms. C said to give you your makeup work,” he said. “We told her we’d stop by before school.”

“And my mom only said yes ‘cause I told her you were tragically injured,” Taylor added, tossing the extra Pop-Tarts she had in her backpack onto my lap. “Strawberry. You’re welcome.”

I sat down and pulled my blanket over my legs.

“Thanks, guys. Seriously.”

“Did it hurt?” Blake asked, flopping into the recliner. “Falling, I mean?”

“Yeah.”

“Like a lot?”

“Like someone tried to rip my arm off.”

Taylor let out a low, long whistle. “Metal.”

Zack gave her a look. “He could’ve died.”

“Still metal,” she shrugged, cracking open her Yoo-hoo.

Then Zack tilted his head. “Wait… why were you even up there?”

I hesitated.

I looked at them—all three.

They weren’t jerks. They weren’t like the kids who whispered about me in the hallway. And they’d come all this way, early, before school, just to check on me.

So, I told them.

Everything.

About Mollie barking at the walls. About the noises in the attic at night. About sneaking up there with my lightsaber, and the nest. The scratching. The shape in the dark. The fall. The hand. The attic door slamming shut on its own.

Their faces changed.

Taylor sat forward slowly; Pop-Tart half-crushed in her hand now.

Zack didn’t blink.

And Blake said, softly, “Dude… what the hell?”

“You think something’s living up there?” Taylor asked, eyes darting toward the ceiling.

“I don’t think,” I said. “I know.”

“It chased you?” Zack asked. “Like—actually chased you?”

I nodded.

“I heard it breathe,” I whispered.

They all looked up at once.

The attic was directly above the living room.

And the house suddenly felt smaller. Quieter. Like we’d said something out loud we weren’t supposed to. 

For a long time, nobody spoke.

Then Blake whispered, “What if it’s listening?”

“Don’t say that,” Taylor said, smacking his arm.

“No, seriously.” Blake shifted nervously in his seat. “What if it knows you’re home alone right now?”

“Okay, you’re freaking yourself out,” Zack said. But his eyes hadn’t left the ceiling.

A faint creak echoed from somewhere upstairs.

All three of them jumped.

I clenched my blanket in one hand. “It does that a lot. Usually at night. Sometimes it… moves around.”

Zack stood and grabbed his backpack. “We should go.”

“Dude, come on,” Taylor said. “You’re not gonna leave him here alone with that thing crawling around the attic.”

“We have school,” he said, but his voice was shaking now. “And it’s not like we can do anything about it in the middle of the day.”

Taylor looked over at me.

I could see it in her face. She wanted to help. She just didn’t know how.

“Let’s come back after school,” she said suddenly. “Like, tonight. I’ll ask my mom if I can stay over.”

“Me too,” Blake said. “I’ll tell my dad I’m staying at Zack’s.”

“Why my house?” Zack asked.

“Because you’re boring and trustworthy,” Taylor shot back. “And we’re gonna need someone to bring snacks.”

Zack rolled his eyes but didn’t argue.

I nodded slowly. “Okay. Yeah. Tonight.”

“We’ll bring flashlights,” Blake said. “And, like… salt. Isn’t that a thing?”

“Only if you’re fighting ghosts,” Taylor muttered. “This thing’s not a ghost. It’s something else.”

“Okay, well… what is it then?”

We all looked at each other.

No one had an answer.

Then—

BANG. BANG. BANG.

We all screamed.

Taylor nearly dropped her Yoo-hoo.

“WHO’S READY FOR MUFFINS?” a voice called through the front door.

“Oh my god,” Blake gasped, clutching his chest. “I’m gonna piss.”

“It’s just my grandma,” I muttered, stumbling to my feet.

I opened the door and there she was: Grandma. Gray sweater. Big smile. A basket of muffins in one hand, an off-brand orange juice jug in the other.

“Oh! I didn’t know you had company!” she beamed.

Taylor stood, adjusting her oversized jacket. “We were just leaving. School. You know.”

“Uh-huh,” Grandma said, eyeing the three of them with that warm, old-lady suspicion that could melt concrete. “Well, I’ll keep an eye on our patient here. Don’t worry.”

Zack cleared his throat. “See you later.”

“After school,” Taylor whispered to me as she passed.

Then she was gone.

All three of them, heading back down the porch and across the lawn, glancing over their shoulders like the house might try to follow.

Grandma shut the door behind them and turned to me, her smile softening.

“You look pale,” she said. “Want to sit with me while I knit? Or would you rather go lay down?”

I stared up at the ceiling.

At the attic.

“I think I’m good right here,” I said quietly.

Grandma made me a grilled cheese and tomato soup and insisted I eat every bite, even though I wasn’t hungry.

She didn’t ask a lot of questions. Just hovered, smiling gently, pouring me juice, tucking the blanket around my legs again even after I kicked it off. She had that quiet, steady kind of love that made you feel guilty for keeping secrets.

After lunch, she flipped through the channels until she landed on a soap opera—something about twins and betrayal and a baby that might be cursed—then settled into the recliner with her knitting needles clacking softly in her lap.

By the time the second commercial break hit, she was out cold. Head tilted, mouth slightly open, one hand still tangled in blue yarn.

The house was quiet again.

Except for the TV.

I left it on and padded down the hall. My wrist still ached, but the pills from the hospital were finally working. I just needed to pee and splash some water on my face.

I pushed open the bathroom door with my good hand and stepped inside.

The door swung closed behind me.

Click.

I turned the faucet on. Let the water run.

And then—

Footsteps.

Fast.

Slapping across the hardwood floor outside.

I spun around.

Something hit the bathroom door.

Hard.

The whole thing shuddered on its hinges.

I backed up.

My heart was racing now, pounding in my ears.

Then—

A hand curled around the edge of the door.

Long fingers. Grayish skin. Black, cracked nails.

It gripped the doorframe like it was trying to keep me in.

“No no no—” I whispered, shoving against the door.

It didn’t move.

I pressed my back to the wall, eyes darting around the room, breath catching in my throat.

That’s when I heard it.

A low, rattling breath.

Not from the other side of the door.

From above.

I looked up—slowly.

The vent above the toilet was rattling slightly, the metal slats twitching like something was pressing against them from the inside.

A soft scrape echoed through the vent.

Then a finger.

Then another.

It was crawling out.

The vent cover popped loose with a soft ping, clattering to the floor.

Something slid through.

Long limbs. Pale skin. Elbows that bent the wrong way.

It dropped into the bathtub behind the shower curtain with a heavy thump.

I couldn’t move.

The room was dead quiet.

Except for the sound of it breathing behind the curtain.

Each breath made the plastic suck in, then puff out again.
Suck in—puff out.

I could see the shape of it now, faint and twisted behind the floral print.

Then the curtain moved.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

Like it was leaning closer.

I opened my mouth to scream—

The door yanked open.

Light flooded in.

The hallway. Grandma’s voice, faint: “Sweetheart?”

I ran.

Out of the bathroom, past her, down the hall, gasping, heart hammering like it was going to crack through my ribs.

She followed, confused, knitting still wrapped around her wrist.

“What happened?” she called after me. “Are you okay? 

Grandma hurried in behind me, a mess of yarn still tangled around her wrist. “What on earth—? What happened?”

I couldn’t speak at first. My chest was tight. My wrist throbbed. My heart was doing somersaults.

She crouched down beside me, one hand on my shoulder. “Was it your arm again? Did something—?”

“It was in the bathroom,” I whispered.

Her brow furrowed.

“What was, sweetheart?”

“It.” I pointed down the hallway. “It grabbed the door. It came through the vent. It dropped into the tub—I saw it. I heardit.”

She stood slowly, eyes narrowing just a little.

“I’ll go check.”

“No—don’t—”

But she was already walking. She walked to the kitchen and pulled a large knife from the knife block.

I watched her disappear down the hall, every second stretching out like rubber. I thought maybe I’d hear her scream. Or call for help. Or say something anything—

But when she came back, she just shook her head.

“There’s nothing there,” she said gently. “No handprints, no vent cover on the floor, no mess in the tub.”

My stomach twisted.

“That’s not possible,” I said.

Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I think you might’ve dozed off and had a nightmare.”

“I was awake.”

She didn’t argue.

She just picked up her knitting and settled back into the recliner.

The house stayed quiet for the rest of the afternoon. Too quiet.

By the time my parents got home, I was already standing at the foot of the stairs, waiting for them.

Dad looked exhausted. His eyes were bloodshot, and his uniform shirt had a grease stain down the front.

“You’re still up?” he asked, tossing his keys into the bowl on the side table.

“I need to ask you something.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

I hesitated. Then said, “Can Zack, Taylor, and Blake come over?”

Dad blinked. “Tonight?”

“Just for a little while. Maybe a sleepover. Nothing big.”

He glanced at Mom, who looked at me with that tired mom-face that says not tonight, but also we feel bad for you.

“I don’t know, bud,” Dad said. “You’re still healing. And I’m beat.”

“They already asked their parents,” I lied quickly. “They’re bringing flashlights and movies. It’s just to hang out. I swear.”

He rubbed his temples. “You sure you’re up for that? After the hospital and—everything?”

I nodded, trying to keep my voice steady. “Yeah. I just… don’t want to be alone tonight.”

Something in that hit him. He didn’t say anything for a moment.

Then he sighed and reached for his phone. “Tell them to be here by nine. Quiet night. No roughhousing.”

I nodded again. “Yes. Thank you.”

He headed for the kitchen. “And don’t go back in the attic. I mean it.”

“I won’t,” I said.

That was a lie too. 

The doorbell rang at 8:47PM.

Blake was the first one through the door, backpack half unzipped, his hoodie sleeves pulled over his hands. “Yo,” he grinned, like we hadn’t just seen each other earlier that morning.

Taylor came in next, wearing flannel pajama pants with little bats on them and carrying a flashlight the size of a baseball bat. “We come bearing snacks and questionable judgment.”

Zack followed with a tote bag full of supplies—flashlights, batteries, two packs of Oreos, and a sketchpad covered in doodles. “My mom gave us Capri Suns, but Taylor chugged most of them in the car.”

I laughed—actually laughed—and stepped back to let them all in.

Then Tori came down the stairs in her tank top and pajama shorts, holding her phone and looking thoroughly unimpressed.

Blake froze halfway through dropping his backpack.

“...Hey,” he said, all casual-like, but his voice cracked halfway through it.

Tori raised one eyebrow. “Hey.”

She looked at me. “If these dorks eat all the pringles…”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “We have our own snacks” 

Blake turned to me, “is she going to join us?!” 

 “She’s not invited.”

She rolled her eyes and started walking toward the kitchen. Blake stared after her like she was the sun and he was an unsupervised moth.

“Is she staying home tonight?” he whispered.

“She lives here,” Taylor said. “Stop being weird.”

“I’m not being weird,” Blake muttered.

“You literally stared at her forehead like it had the answers to the universe.”

“I didn’t—”

“She’s too old for you, Blake,” Zack said, dropping the tote bag with a thud.

“Age is just a number,” Blake replied.

“And restraining orders are just paperwork,” Taylor deadpanned.

We moved into the living room and laid everything out: sleeping bags, pillows, snacks, the flashlight arsenal. I put on Tremors—Blake’s pick—because he claimed it was “educational” for people dealing with underground monsters.

Taylor was already halfway into the Oreos, and Zack was organizing the batteries like we were about to defuse a bomb.

It felt normal. For a little while.

The monster didn’t feel so close.

We laughed too loud. The movie jumped a couple times because our DVD player was scratched, and Blake kept yelling “THIS IS FORESHADOWING” every time Kevin Bacon did anything brave.

But under it all, we were waiting.
Waiting for the house to go quiet.

Waiting for the lights to go out.
For my parents to retreat upstairs.

At around 10:40PM, they finally did.

We heard Mom’s voice say, “Please don’t stay up all night,” and then Dad’s muttered “They better not wreck the furniture.”

Footsteps on the stairs.

The creak of the bedroom door.

Silence.

Taylor muted the movie.

We all looked at each other.

Zack was the first to speak. “So… we doing this?”

Taylor nodded. “I say we check the attic. All of us. Flashlights, snacks, slingshot—”

“I forgot the salt,” Blake said.

“No one asked for salt,” she hissed.

“I’m just saying, if it is a ghost, we’re unprotected.”

“It’s not a ghost,” I whispered. “It’s something else. Something that breathes and moves and hurts things.”

Everyone went quiet.

“I want to know what it is,” I said. “I need to know.”

Zack sat forward. “Then we make a plan. In and out. If anything feels off, we leave. No hero stuff.”

Blake nodded, clutching his flashlight like a sword.

Taylor grinned and cracked her knuckles. “Monster-hunting club begins tonight.”

We turned off the movie.

And started getting ready.

We stood in the hallway beneath the attic hatch, flashlights in hand, all four of us staring up at the square in the ceiling like it might blink.

The pull string was gone.

Blake tapped the ceiling with a plastic Wiffle bat he’d brought for “backup,” as if the attic might just open for effort. It didn’t.

“So…” he whispered, “do we have a plan? Or are we just standing here until the attic gets bored and eats us?”

“I’ve got it,” Taylor said, stepping back and dragging over a folding step stool she’d pulled from the laundry room. She thudded it into place beneath the hatch, climbed up two steps, and squinted at the latch. “It’s a little out of reach. I need something to pop it open.”

Blake held out a ruler with duct tape wrapped around the tip. “Custom made.”

Taylor blinked. “Why do you have that?”

“For science.”

Zack just shook his head and held up the metal rod from a broken curtain they found in the garage. “Try this instead.”

Taylor smirked. “Much better.”

She stretched on the top step, flashlight clamped under her arm, and jabbed the rod upward. It took a few tries, but finally—click.

The latch gave.

The attic door didn’t fall open fast—it creaked down slow, groaning the way old wood does in scary movies, until the opening yawned above us.

We all stared at the darkness inside.

“I am regretting this,” Blake whispered.

“You regret everything,” Zack said.

“I regret being friends with you,” Blake shot back.

I stepped forward with my cast cradled close. “I’ll hold the ladder steady. When you all get up there you can pull me up.”

“I got it,” Taylor said. “I’ll go first.”

Just as she grabbed the top rung of the attic ladder—

“What the hell are you doing?”

We all jumped.

Blake actually gasped. Zack swore under his breath.

Tori stood at the end of the hallway, holding a half-eaten Pop-Tart in one hand and looking like she’d caught us trying to summon the devil.

“Seriously?” she said, eyeing the gear. “This is your plan?”

“I told you to stay in your room,” I muttered.

Tori ignored me. “You’re going up there now? With a broken arm, a ruler, and Blake?”

“I brought a foam sword too,” Blake added helpfully.

“I rest my case.”

Taylor gave her a slow blink. “You coming over here just to roast us or…?”

Tori stared up at the attic, her face hard to read.

Then, without another word, she walked over, took the flashlight from Zack’s hand, and stepped beside the ladder.

She didn’t look at me. Just stared into the black square above.

“Mollie was my dog too.”

The hallway went quiet.

Blake blinked at her like she’d just confessed a crush. Taylor actually looked impressed. And Zack—Zack didn’t say a word. He just adjusted the flashlight beam.

Tori stepped up beside Taylor.

“We going,” she said, “or are we gonna stand here all night waiting to pee our pants?”

The attic creaked as we climbed in one by one.

Taylor went first, her flashlight cutting a shaky beam across the dust-heavy air. Blake followed, muttering “nope, nope, nope” under his breath the entire time. Zack climbed behind him, trying to pretend he wasn’t breathing fast. I was last, hoisting myself up one-handed while Tori reached down and helped steady me with surprising care.

The air was warmer than it should’ve been—thick, almost humid. It smelled like insulation and mildew and something sweet underneath, like rotting fruit or meat left out too long.

“Ugh, it smells like someone microwaved a diaper,” Blake whispered, holding his shirt over his nose.

“No one light a match,” Zack said. “The air up here might be flammable.”

We all stood together under the low, angled ceiling. The old Christmas boxes were still stacked near the wall. The fan blades Dad took down three summers ago were still leaning in the corner.

But the nest—

The thing I saw two nights ago, made of insulation and shredded blankets and god-knows-what else—

Was gone.

“Wait,” I said, spinning slowly in a circle. “Wait, no. No, it was right here.”

I stepped toward the far corner, flashlight shaking.

“There was a nest,” I said. “It was—like, something had made it. It was here. It chased me from right here.”

Tori walked beside me, scanning the floor with her light. “There’s nothing. You sure it wasn’t another part of the attic?”

“I’m sure. I swear it—”

And then—

The attic breathed.

Or maybe it exhaled.

A long, low sound, like something massive shifting in the rafters.

My flashlight flickered.

I turned fast. “Did you hear that?”

“Hear what?” Zack whispered.

“I don’t know but maybe we need to leave,” Blake said. “Right now. No notes, no souvenirs—just vibes and trauma, let’s go—”

It moved.

A shape. A blur. Something behind the beams. It darted, fast and low, and no one else reacted.

Only me.

“It’s here—” I yelled.

No one answered.

“GUYS, IT’S HERE—”

The light flared, and then—

It lunged.

I didn’t see its face.

Just claws.

Long, black claws raked across the floor as it tore forward. The shadows swallowed it and spat it back out like smoke. I saw it leap—too fast, too tall—and I shoved Zack sideways as it crashed through where he’d been standing.

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” he yelled.

I didn’t answer.

“WE HAVE TO GO!” I screamed.

I ran.

Back toward the hatch.

Back toward the edge of the attic.

But the ladder wasn’t there anymore. Someone had pulled it up behind us.

And that’s when the thing roared—low and wrong and wet.

It charged.

I turned to the only other way out: the window.

A tiny square, just big enough to fit through.

“Tori!” I shouted. “The window!”

I got there first, yanking it open with a grunt. Taylor was already behind me, kicking the crate under it into place.

We climbed out one by one, onto the slanted roof just above the back porch.

The night air hit me like a punch. Cold. Wet. The stars overhead blurred by my tears and panic.

Blake slipped on the shingles and screamed. Taylor grabbed him.

Zack looked at me wildly, “what are you doing!? Stop!”

Tori was last.

But as she turned to climb through—

The thing reached out.

A clawed hand swiped out of the darkness, slashing toward her back. She twisted just in time, swinging the flashlight like a weapon and connecting with a sickening CRACK.

“GO!” she shouted.

But it grabbed her ankle.

She kicked. Screamed.

Zack reached for her.

The roof groaned.

She almost made it.

And then—

The shingle beneath her foot slipped.

And she fell.

I watched her tumble backward into the darkness below, her scream trailing off as her body disappeared from sight.

Then silence.

Just our breath. The hum of the night. The wind.

And the open window behind us.

Still breathing.

We stood on the roof for what felt like forever.

No one said anything.

The wind moved through the trees below. Porch lights from the neighbors cast long shadows on the lawn. And somewhere out there—Tori.

She wasn’t screaming anymore.

“Come on,” I said, scrambling toward the edge. “We have to find her—”

Zack grabbed my good arm. “Careful.”

Blake looked like he might throw up. His flashlight was shaking so bad the beam was bouncing off the trees.

Taylor was already climbing down the drainpipe mumbling as she went, “why did you do that?!” 

We followed.

By the time we reached the ground, we found her crumpled near the base of the hedges—face scratched, one shoe missing, her left leg bent wrong.

She was breathing.

Barely.

Her eyes fluttered open for a second. She saw me.

Then closed them again...

The ambulance came fast.

Too fast.

Blue lights lit up our front yard while neighbors peeked through their blinds. My parents ran outside barefoot. My mom screamed when she saw Tori on the stretcher.

The paramedics asked questions. Zack answered most of them. Taylor barely spoke. Blake cried once, then pretended he wasn’t.

No one asked me anything.

No one looked at me.

Later, inside, the four of us sat in the living room, scattered across the floor like broken puzzle pieces.

The popcorn bowl had spilled during the panic. One of the sleeping bags was still half-zipped. The Tremors DVD menu looped quietly on the TV screen.

I hugged my knees, cast pressed to my chest, and stared at the carpet.

“I saw it,” I whispered. “It grabbed her. It pulled her back.”

No one said anything.

Taylor sat with her back to the couch, arms crossed, face hard. Her ponytail was messed up, and her sleeve had blood on it.

Zack didn’t even look at me.

“She wouldn’t have gone up there,” he said flatly, “if it weren’t for you.”

That hit harder than I thought it would.

“I didn’t make her go,” I said. “She wanted to. She said—”

“Yeah,” Taylor cut in, “she said ‘Mollie was my dog too.’ Because she felt bad for you.”

Blake sniffled from the recliner. “You said we’d just look. You said it wasn’t going to do anything.”

“I didn’t know it would attack,” I snapped. “I didn’t know it would—”

“It’s all in your head, man,” Zack said. “There was nothing there.”

“There was!” I shouted, louder than I meant to. “I saw it. It chased us. It grabbed her ankle.”

Silence.

Taylor finally looked at me.

But not like she believed me.

Like she was looking at someone she used to know.

“You’re the only one who ever sees it,” she said. “That’s kinda weird, don’t you think?”

I didn’t have an answer.

Taylor looked down to the floor, “nothing grabbed her…we all saw what happened…you pushed her.”

I looked down at the carpet, suddenly aware of how loud my breathing was.

Outside, the ambulance was gone.

So was Tori.

The front door creaked open.

Mom stepped in first, her face pale like a ghost. Behind her came Dad, still in his pajamas, hair windblown, eyes heavy with something worse than anger.

The kind of look you give someone when you don’t recognize them anymore.

“Get your stuff,” Mom said to the others.

No one said a word.

Taylor. Zack. Blake. They just moved. Silent. Tired. Like kids leaving a funeral.

I didn’t expect a goodbye, but it still hurt when I didn’t get one.

Mom ushered them out without looking back. Then the door closed.

Just me and Dad now.

The house groaned softly in the quiet. The movie menu still looped on the TV—“Play,” “Scene Select,” “Special Features.” The last time anything felt normal.

Dad walked over to the couch and sat down slowly. He looked like he’d aged ten years in one night.

I didn’t move from the floor.

He rubbed his face with both hands, then looked at me.

“I just got off the phone with the hospital,” he said, voice raw. “Tori’s stable. Banged up bad. But she’s gonna be okay.”

I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding.

He nodded to himself. Then leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.

There was a long silence.

Then he said, “Your friends… they told us what happened.”

I looked away.

“They said it was your idea. That you made them go up there. That you were the only one who saw anything.”

I said nothing.

“But I believe you think it’s real,” he added, softly. “I do.”

My throat burned.

“It is real,” I whispered.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he let out a shaky breath and said, “There’s something I haven’t told you.”

That made me look up.

He wasn’t meeting my eyes. Just staring at the floor.

“The night Mollie died…” he started, voice slow, like the words were too heavy to push out. “I told your mom I found her in the attic. I told you she must’ve gotten into poison.”

I nodded. “You said she was already gone.”

“She was. But it wasn’t poison.”

He finally looked at me.

“When I found you up there… there wasn’t any rat bait. No spilled box. No teeth marks.”

He swallowed hard.

“There was just a hammer. Covered in blood. And your hands—your shirt—you were covered too.”

I froze.

A strange ringing filled my ears.

“I thought… maybe she’d already been hurt. Maybe you’d found her like that and tried to help. Maybe you grabbed the hammer because you were scared. I wanted to believe that. You had tried to soak up her blood with your blanket but…”

“Dad…”

“But now—after Tori, after the attic, after tonight…” He trailed off.

I stared at him, my pulse thudding like thunder in my ears.

“I think we need to go back,” he said quietly. “Back to the neurologist. Back to Dr. Kim.”

I shook my head.

“You remember what she said when you were five,” he continued. “After the surgery. About the scar tissue? That if anything changed, if the headaches came back, if you started… seeing things—”

“I’m not seeing things,” I snapped.

He didn’t argue.

He just said, “I don’t think this is your fault. But I think something’s wrong. Something we can’t see.”

I stood up, fists clenched.

“You think I hurt Mollie?”

“I think something hurt you,” he said. “And I don’t know how to fix it.”

My chest felt tight.

My cast itched like fire.

“You didn’t see it,” I whispered. “You never see it.”

He stood, slower than me. Careful.

“I see you. And that’s enough to scare the hell out of me.”

 

Mom stayed at the hospital with Tori.

Dad made a bed on the couch, but I knew he wasn’t sleeping. I could hear him tossing. Getting up. Sitting back down. Every hour or so, he’d check on me through the crack in my bedroom door.

He didn’t trust me anymore.

And maybe he was right.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

The creature. The attic. The way no one else had seen it. The hammer. The blood. The thing inside the wall breathing.

If it was in my head… then why did everything feel so real?

Around 3AM, I couldn’t take it anymore.

I grabbed my plastic lightsaber, flicked the red blade to life, and crouched beside the wall in my room where I first heard the noise. 

The plaster felt cold under my fingers. Hollow.

I grabbed the old metal bat from under my bed.

And I started swinging.

CRACK.
CRACK.

Drywall split apart. Chunks of insulation spilled onto the floor like guts. Dust filled the air like ash.

Behind it—wooden beams. And a gap.

Big enough to crawl through.

Inside the walls, it was tighter than I expected.

Spiderwebs clung to my face. The wood groaned around me. But I knew the house—my house. And I knew that if I went up just a little further, past the bathroom vent, past the pipes, past the beams…

I could get to the attic.

It was a short crawl.

But it felt like a mile.

The attic opened like a mouth.

The lightsaber buzzed softly, casting everything in a red haze.

And then I saw it.

The creature.

It stood taller than a man. Skin stretched too tight. Limbs long and crooked. Its mouth hung open—not for a scream, not a growl, just a sound like breathing from the bottom of a well.

Its eyes locked on me.

It charged. I pulled back a marble in the slingshot and let it fly and it bounced off its skull.

I swung the lightsaber. Plastic cracked across its arm.

It didn’t flinch.

It lunged— snarling and snapping its teeth at me I tossed my arm forward

And it bit down on my cast.

I screamed. Felt the pressure. The pain.

I slammed the saber against its skull over and over, backing toward the old boxes in the corner.

One toppled.

A can of paint thinner splattered onto the floor. The creature lifted me with one hand and chucked me against the far wall my arm getting tangled in wires in the corner. The weight of my body jerking them from their place and causing sparks to fly out into the air of the attic.

The flame caught the insulation like a match to dry leaves. The mix of the paint thinner and the sparks made it go up quick.

Whoosh.

Fire spread fast.

Too fast.

The attic filled with smoke.

Flames danced across the beams, chewing up memories. Christmas boxes. Old furniture. Toys.

The creature screamed.

A real one this time.

Animal and furious.

I scrambled for the window, climbing up onto the roof.

Smoke poured from the attic window behind me, thick and black, curling into the sky like a signal flare. The heat licked at my back as I scrambled onto the pitched roof, my cast thudding against the shingles.

The monster came through the fire.

It burst out of the window like a living shadow, its skin scorched and blistered, its claws dragging sparks across the wood. Parts of it still smoked. One shoulder was blackened. The side of its face looked like melted wax—but it didn’t stop.

It moved like it couldn’t feel pain.

Like it had never been alive in the first place.

I turned and ran, slipping across the slanted rooftop, nails tearing at the shingles as I tried to crawl higher. The slope dipped fast near the edge, right above the driveway. One wrong step and I’d fall.

The creature lunged again.

I spun, swinging the broken lightsaber hilt like a club. It caught the monster’s jaw with a crack, sending it staggering, but only for a second. It came back harder—claws slashing.

One caught my side.

The fabric of my shirt ripped. I felt heat and pain, and then blood.

I screamed.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!”

I shoved it. Hard. With everything I had.

We both slid.

Shingles ripped free beneath our weight. The roof groaned under us. A beam snapped with a deep POP from below.

I tried to dig my fingers into the edge. My cast scraped uselessly along the surface.

The creature grabbed my leg.

I kicked wildly, boots slamming into its burned face. Its grip loosened for just a second—

And that’s when the roof gave way.

There was a deep, horrible cracking sound, and suddenly everything tilted.

The whole corner of the roof collapsed in flames.

We fell together, tangled—me and the thing that wasn’t supposed to exist.

The air ripped past me.
Heat roared up to meet us.
Then—

Blackness…

 

The lights were soft. The air sterile. Machines beeped in slow, steady rhythms.

I opened my eyes.

White sheets.

An IV in my arm.

My wrist in a new cast.

And Dad, sitting beside me, his arm bandaged in thick, burnt gauze.

“You’re awake,” he said quietly.

My throat was dry. “Tori?”

“She’s okay. Your mom’s still with her.”

I nodded.

“House is gone nearly” he said. “Burned up the attic and your room, the Fire chief says it started in the attic. Electrical wiring. That’s what they think.”

I looked away.

“I pulled you out from under what was left of your room,” he continued. “the doctor’s said it was a miracle.” 

I didn’t answer. I looked at his arm that was bandaged, he must have been burnt in the fire trying to save me.

 A knock came at the door.

Dr. Kim stepped in, holding a folder.

She smiled softly at me. “Good to see you, sweetheart. We ran a scan while you were under.”

She handed the folder to Dad.

He opened it.

Stared for a long time.

Then he turned it toward me.

An MRI.

Black and white. Fuzzy.

But clear enough.

Something round, pressing into part of my brain.

Like a shadow blooming behind my eyes.

Dad’s voice cracked.

1q4e8i4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4e8i4,Help us with our living room!,"My partner and I are trying to redesign our living room. 

We have an open plan living and dining area that we don't really know how to furnish. I've just moved the brown couch pictured back onto the wall. Previously it was facing the black and green couch on the edge of the blue carpet, and we didn't have the red carpet. This left a lot of dead space behind which wasn't really being used. I like having the couches on opposite walls as it leaves a huge amount of usable floor space for things like yoga, playing with dog, just sitting on the floor, etc. But my partner thinks that it looks weird having the couches so far apart, and isn't a good vibe for socializing. 

I would love some ideas for how we could overhaul the space to maximize open floor space, but also have a nice space for hanging out / entertaining guests. We don't have a TV and aren't really considering getting one at the moment, but it is an option. 

Idea 1: Get a new L shaped couch on the left side wall, place a coffee table in front of it, and have a couple of armchairs facing the couch (one opposite facing, one on the side). This would be a nice conversation / hang out space. On the far right wall I would have a sideboard with books/plants/storage, and have a large carpet covering the whole area. 

Idea 2: Have a TV on the right hand wall, with a large couch facing the TV, and an armchair beside the couch facing towards the backyard). Keep a large open space behind the couch with a separate carpet there for activities. 

Any input is much appreciated! ",2,1767594210.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False
