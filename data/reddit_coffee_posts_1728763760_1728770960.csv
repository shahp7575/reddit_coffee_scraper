In today’s digital world, privacy and security are essential concerns for anyone who spends time online. Whether you’re browsing the web, streaming content, or accessing sensitive data, ensuring that your connection is protected is a must. This is where proxy servers, especially SOCKS4 proxies, come into play. They serve as intermediaries between your device and the internet, offering various benefits like enhanced security, anonymity, and the ability to bypass geo-restrictions. But what makes SOCKS4 proxies stand out in the world of secure browsing? Let’s dive in and explore how SOCKS4 proxies can provide reliable connectivity and a secure browsing experience.

# What Are SOCKS Proxies?

Before we get into the details of SOCKS4, it’s important to understand what a proxy server is. Essentially, a proxy acts as a middleman between your device and the websites you want to access. When you use a proxy, your device doesn’t directly connect to the internet; instead, the proxy server handles that connection for you.

There are several types of proxies available, each with different protocols and use cases. SOCKS proxies, in particular, stand out for their versatility. Unlike HTTP proxies, which only handle specific web traffic, SOCKS proxies are designed to manage any kind of internet traffic, including browsing, file transfers, and email. This makes SOCKS proxies ideal for more advanced use cases where security and anonymity are a priority.

# How SOCKS4 Proxies Work

SOCKS4 is a version of the SOCKS protocol, which operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. It works by routing your traffic through a proxy server, masking your IP address, and handling your connection requests on your behalf. But what sets SOCKS4 apart from other proxy types? Primarily, SOCKS4 doesn’t interpret or modify the traffic that passes through it. This is beneficial for users who want pure traffic forwarding without interference from the proxy itself.

In technical terms, when you send a request through a SOCKS4 proxy, it handles the communication by assigning a new IP address. This way, the websites you interact with only see the IP of the proxy server, not your actual device. This layer of separation enhances your privacy, as your true identity and location are hidden.

# Key Features of SOCKS4 Proxies

When discussing SOCKS4 proxies, several key features make them appealing to users focused on privacy and performance.

1. **Layered Anonymity and Privacy**: Since SOCKS4 proxies forward traffic without inspecting it, they don’t store logs or track your browsing behavior, ensuring your online activities remain anonymous.
2. **Speed and Performance**: SOCKS4 proxies are known for their fast connection speeds. By handling fewer security layers compared to other protocols, they can maintain high performance without sacrificing too much in terms of security.
3. **Bypassing Geo-restrictions**: Because your traffic is routed through a different IP address, SOCKS4 proxies allow you to access content that may be restricted in your region. This makes it ideal for accessing blocked websites or services.

# Why Choose SOCKS4 for Secure Browsing?

While SOCKS5 may offer more advanced features like authentication and encryption, SOCKS4 has its own strengths. For one, it is simpler to set up, making it accessible even to users who aren’t particularly tech-savvy. Additionally, for users who prioritize speed over encryption, SOCKS4 can be the better option. It still provides a solid level of anonymity, without the performance hit that encryption can sometimes cause.

# SOCKS4 vs. SOCKS5 Proxies

It’s important to note the differences between SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies. While both are designed to handle any kind of traffic, SOCKS5 introduces extra features such as support for UDP (which is useful for tasks like online gaming) and built-in authentication. SOCKS4, on the other hand, only handles TCP traffic and doesn’t include authentication by default.

This simplicity can be an advantage for users who don’t need the extra features of SOCKS5, as SOCKS4 can often provide faster speeds. If encryption or identity verification isn’t a priority for your use case, SOCKS4 might be the better choice, especially for applications that require quick, unfiltered traffic forwarding.

# How SOCKS4 Proxies Enhance Online Privacy

In an age where data privacy is constantly under threat, using a SOCKS4 proxy can help keep your information safe. By hiding your real IP address, these proxies prevent websites and online services from pinpointing your exact location. This makes it harder for third parties, including advertisers and cybercriminals, to track your browsing behavior or steal your information.

For individuals who are particularly concerned about government surveillance or invasive tracking practices, SOCKS4 proxies offer a reliable way to maintain anonymity. Whether you’re engaging in sensitive communications or simply want to browse without being followed by ad trackers, SOCKS4 helps you maintain control over your online identity.

# Use Cases for SOCKS4 Proxies

The versatility of SOCKS4 proxies makes them suitable for a wide range of use cases. One of the most common is securing your browsing when connected to public Wi-Fi networks. Public networks, like those found in coffee shops or airports, are notorious for their lack of security, making it easy for cybercriminals to intercept your traffic. A SOCKS4 proxy adds an extra layer of security by routing your traffic through a secure server, keeping prying eyes at bay.

Another popular use case is bypassing regional content restrictions. Many streaming services or websites limit access based on location, but by using a SOCKS4 proxy with an IP address in a different region, you can easily unlock content that would otherwise be unavailable.

# SOCKS4 Proxies for Gaming

For online gamers, using a SOCKS4 proxy can be a game-changer—literally. Many multiplayer games apply geo-restrictions or implement IP-based bans, which can prevent players from accessing certain servers. SOCKS4 proxies can bypass these restrictions by masking your real IP address and allowing you to connect to servers in different regions.

Additionally, SOCKS4 proxies are known for their low-latency performance, which is crucial for gaming. The less interference and lag you experience, the more competitive edge you have in online games. Plus, the added privacy can help protect you from potential DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, which some players use to disrupt opponents.

# SOCKS4 Proxies in Business Environments

Businesses can also benefit from SOCKS4 proxies, especially those that prioritize security and privacy for their employees. With the rise of remote work, many companies have found it necessary to implement tools that protect their workforce from cyber threats. SOCKS4 proxies provide a simple way to ensure that employees can connect securely to company resources, without revealing their personal IP addresses.

For businesses that need to conduct research on competitors or navigate websites without leaving a trace, SOCKS4 proxies can offer anonymity. They’re particularly useful when conducting market research or performing sensitive operations that require discretion.

# Setting Up a SOCKS4 Proxy

Getting a SOCKS4 proxy up and running is a straightforward process, even if you don’t have advanced technical knowledge. Most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, have built-in settings that allow users to configure proxies.

First, you’ll need the IP address and port number of your chosen SOCKS4 proxy. Once you have that information, you can enter it into your device’s network settings under the proxy configuration section. Be sure to select SOCKS4 as the protocol, as many devices also support other types of proxies like SOCKS5 or HTTP.

If you run into any issues, it’s often a simple fix. Double-check that you’ve entered the correct IP address and port, and make sure that your firewall or antivirus software isn’t blocking the connection.

# SOCKS4 Proxies and Browser Compatibility

Most major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, support SOCKS4 proxies. Configuring a browser to use SOCKS4 is similar to the setup process on your operating system. Typically, you’ll need to enter the proxy details within the browser’s settings, under the ""Network"" or ""Connection"" tab.

It’s also a good idea to clear your browser’s cache before using a SOCKS4 proxy, as this can help prevent any potential conflicts with previously stored data. By doing so, you’ll ensure that all traffic is routed through the proxy without any issues.

# Challenges and Limitations of SOCKS4 Proxies

Despite their many advantages, SOCKS4 proxies do have some limitations. One major drawback is the lack of built-in encryption. While SOCKS4 proxies hide your IP address and provide some level of anonymity, they don’t encrypt the data you send and receive. This means that if you’re transmitting sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, additional security measures like a VPN may be necessary.

Another limitation is that SOCKS4 proxies are not always compatible with all applications. Some software, particularly those that rely on complex authentication processes, may not work as smoothly with SOCKS4 proxies.

# Enhancing SOCKS4 Proxies with Other Security Measures

To address the limitations of SOCKS4 proxies, you can pair them with other security tools to create a more comprehensive protection strategy. One popular method is using a SOCKS4 proxy alongside a VPN (Virtual Private Network). This way, the VPN can provide encryption while the SOCKS4 proxy handles traffic routing and anonymity. This combination creates a multi-layered security system that protects both your data and your identity.

Other tools, such as encryption software or secure browsers, can also enhance the effectiveness of a SOCKS4 proxy. The key is to find the right balance between security and performance, ensuring that you stay safe online without compromising speed or usability.

# Conclusion

SOCKS4 proxies offer a reliable and efficient way to secure your internet browsing. With their ability to mask your IP address, bypass geo-restrictions, and maintain a high level of performance, they’re an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their online privacy. Whether you’re a casual browser, an online gamer, or a business professional, SOCKS4 proxies can provide the security and anonymity you need to browse the web with confidence. While they may lack some of the advanced features found in SOCKS5 or VPNs, their simplicity and speed make them a valuable tool in your cybersecurity arsenal.",1,1728770830.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

1g2b0sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g2b0sa/being_dead_has_its_perks/,Being dead has its perks. ,"It was early August in Marren, and the town was still half asleep, but I was awake, and as usual, I was thinking about the dead. I lay belly up in front of a rusting fan doing its decrepit best to fight off the heat. The fan turned painfully slowly, a rickety side to side, like a geriatric old woman crossing the road one agonising, shuffling, step at a time. The creak of the blades rotating cut through all the dead faces crawling around in my head. I thought about throwing it out of the window, ending its suffering, but it was too hot to sacrifice even the tiny breeze it was giving me. I had my legs kicked above my head, resting on the wall that was covered from top to bottom in time-stained polaroids, like a wallpaper print of all the people I loved the most. I slept each night with them watching over me. My celluloid guardian angels, forever watching so I wouldn’t forget their faces. Sweat pooled in my collar bones, and even though the blinds were closed, the sun was relentless as it fought its way through the gaps. 

Chrissy came in, footsteps loud and so familiar I didn’t need to look to see if it was her because I knew her from the soles up. From sole to soul, was the way it felt. She threw herself down onto my bed like she had so many times before, shape familiar as my own on the blankets. Her bright pink hair fanned out from her temples like a sunset in late June, a soft and beautiful chemical smear, carrying the whole summer sky on her head. 

“Fuck me up the ass and call me Jesus, but it’s hot” she said, throwing her legs up to join mine. Her dusty combat boots hovered against the polaroid wall. Her right boot came to rest in front of a photo of us on the first day of high school. Eyes bright, middle fingers in matching chipped purple polish flipped up at the camera, arms slung around each other. Her left boot fell against a polaroid of me doing a handstand she’d taken at the beach, the year her brother Travis got his license. We spent all Spring just driving out of town as fast as Travis’s truck would go, Chrissy screaming at him to go faster, shaking his headrest, all of us pretending we’d never heard of shitty little place called Marren as the streets disappeared behind the tires in a cloud of dust. 

“Well then Jesus, did you bring any lube?” I said. Chrissy grinned and stuck out her tongue as a reply, too lazy in the heat to think of a comeback. We lolled our heads and let them hang off the mattress. The room was now upside down, but Chrissy was still the right way up. That was how things often seemed these days. 

“It’s gonna happen again Sadie.” She said, with her eyes closed. The heat pressed in, and outside I could hear a sprinkler starting up. Summer lazed on through the morning, but I was now wide awake, and the dead were loud in my head. *Again, again, again*.

“Ok.” I sat up. That was all there was to say. No point in questioning the inevitable. “When and where?” 

“Don’t know that yet. Don’t even know his name yet. He’s getting hungry.” Her forehead creased. “He’s been dreaming about her.” She shook her head. “Dreamin’ real bad dreams.”

“Just tell me what to do. Where to be. We’ll stop him.” I said. I looked down at her, still the only right thing up in the room. “We always do.” I lay back down. 

“I know.” She said, our legs side by side above our heads almost touching, like we were joined at the hip, grown from the same bones. “But I think you’ll have to kill him.” 

I side-eyed her, taking her in as she swore at the fan, panting like a dog in the summer heat. I looked at the constellation of freckles across the bridge of her nose, and the small silver bar through her right eyebrow that flashed like a star when it caught the light. Her eyeshadow was dark, smudged like she’d slept in it, and though right now her eyes were closed, I knew them so well that I knew when they opened, they would be deep green like the trees in spring, right before they burst with flower blooms. 

I looked at the gaping hole where her jawbone should be on the left side of her face. I could see the rips through the layers of sinew and skin to her cracked teeth, a jagged half moon slicing across her cheek, putting her face in eclipse. The soft curve of her eye socket hung just below her forest green eye. There was loose cartilage hanging round the crush of her brow bone, poking through sharp and white. I looked at the blood that floats gently in small looping tendrils just above the surface of where her skull is caved in. Chrissy is my best friend, and I never get tired of looking at her face. 



I guess I should also mention that Chrissy is dead. 



To be specific, Chrissy is dead because when we were sixteen years old, a man hunted her down through the woods, bashed her head in with a rock and left her to die after he was done with her body. Chrissy has been dead for 5 years 11 months and 22 days if we’re being *really* specific. 

I started seeing her two weeks after she died. At first, I thought the psych ward was calling my name, grief finally pulling me all the way under. But I’m not crazy, I swear. I’m not lying either. The things I’ve done are very, very real. 

Chrissy may be dead, but I can’t imagine life without her. But let me go back a little, to before that sweltering morning in my room in August, before I had to hunt down and kill a hungry man I would later find out was named Amos Everett. Before all the bad, I want to talk about all the good. All the love. There’s always love, and I forget about it sometimes, but it was there, and it’s still here. I carry it. 



When we met, I was five, and Chrissy was five. I had blue eyes like a crayola sky and she had green, like apples and grass and four leaf lucky clovers. We loved playing tag in the woods, and daisy chains and ghost stories and glitter. We loved the horses that lived in the field behind the trailer park, would spend hours chasing after them behind the chain link fences, wishing we could keep up, kicking up clouds of dust and grass with our battered sneakers. We loved stealing gummy worms from the gas station and hiding out in the magnolia trees to share our stolen goods, sun-melted sugar on our hands the only evidence left behind. When I fell down, Chrissy would be there, to swipe one curious finger through the bloody scrape on my knee before carefully pressing a pink bandaid on top, pulling me back up with both hands, wiping my eyes and spinning us in circles over and over until I stopped crying and started laughing instead. 

When I was seven, Chrissy was seven. We got the training wheels on our bikes off on the same day, out in the yard practicing with her older siblings and her cousins, getting rides to school with them while my mom was in and our of the hospital. Chrissy’s bike was hand-me-down blue with flames painted up the sides by her Dad, and she rode so fast it was like like she was burning up the sidewalks when she pedalled past in a blur of sugar and blonde hair. My bike was the colour of dirt, with butterfly stickers covering up the rust on the handlebars, slapped on with careful application by Chrissy after the other kids laughed at me for my run down ride.

When Chrissy was eight, I was eight. She could run faster than any of the boys in our grade, and I was never far behind, always following on her heels, kicking up dust like a shadow. Sometimes she’d slow her pace a little so we could run side by side in the sun in our white tube socks, matching our strides like we were twins made of muscle and bone. But sometimes there was something in her that just needed to run, and I grew used to the sight of her back as she left me behind, left everything behind, like if she just ran fast enough she would grow wings from her shoulder blades and fly away. She would braid my hair for me on the playground just like her sister Luanna taught her, so we could match, her with blue ribbons and mine with red. We’d listen to anything on her older sister’s busted CD player as long as it was loud, Britney Spears and Sum 41, Tupac and the Backstreet Boys, Avril Lavigne and Willie Nelson, eating peach rings while her mama painted our nails sat on the carpet with us cross-legged, playing we were grown up at the salon. I still slept with a nightlight at home, but whenever I stayed over at Chrissy’s when my mom was getting really bad, the dark in her room didn’t bother me so bad. 

When Chrissy was 10, I was 10. I was taller now, and she was mad about it. Chrissy loved beanie babies, and firing her Travis’s BB gun at Bud cans on their back porch while I watched and screamed and cheered her on like a little animal. I loved shiny purple eyeshadow and pretending we were mermaids at the community pool in the summer, and learning dance routines off MTV, which we would practice for hours in my room. We would stay up all night watching the scariest horror movies her Daddy had on VHS, and scream our lungs out at every jump scare and then laugh so hard at each other for being scared we almost pissed our pants. But I was never really scared, when I was with her. On Chrissy’s tenth birthday we stole two of her mama’s Newports and smoked them in secret like we were lighting birthday candles, giggling and choking on the spearmint smoke, side by side crouched in the long grass with our knees touching. We felt like we were fully grown in our denim cutoffs underneath that yawning sky, studded with stars like spilled glitter. 

When I was thirteen, Chrissy was thirteen. We had waist length hair we would brush for each other, yanking through tangles until we shone. We made matching friendship bracelets with our names spelled out in beads so all the other girls in school would know that we were yin and yang; where one went, the other would never be far behind. Twin flames. We always got joint invites, whether it was trailer park slumber parties on mattresses outside, or rich kids pool parties in the big white houses at the edge of Marren, because if I wasn’t invited, Chrissy would go feral. Whoever’s invite it was would end up begging me to come, admittedly sometimes crying. Chrissy had that effect, but nobody seemed to care. Everyone wanted to be her friend. Like petting a stray dog before it bites, because it looks so beautiful despite its jaws. We loved sharing vanilla lipgloss, and dollar store perfume, and reading teen magazines. We loved rhinestones and butterflies and boybands and playing with hunting knives in the woods. When a kid called Billy Jensen and his slimy friends pinned me round the back of the gym and Billy stuck his hand up my skirt, Chrissy punched him so hard she knocked his front tooth out and kept it in a match box like a little hunting trophy. I still have it on a shelf in my room. 

When I was fifteen, Chrissy was fifteen. I moved in with my Aunt Jane, and I had a backyard now too, and red curtains on my window she made for me herself, and Marren had never seemed smaller. Me and Chrissy would scheme all weekend, pinning maps to my bedroom walls, all the places we would be. We were gonna burn high school to the ground. We were cheerleaders, and we swore we would be smarter and cooler and bigger and stronger than everyone else. We would get our diplomas and leave everyone and everything in the rearview mirror as soon as we got our licences,, send postcards from coast to coast. This town was small and we were as big as the whole goddamn sky. We were gonna chew it up and spit it back out, move to Hollywood or Alaska or Nashville or Paris or Hawaii or Tokyo or the fucking moon, and never ever look back. 

We were at that age when boys were still chasing us, and it wasn’t just playground tag anymore. It was something more animal. But Chrissy had taught me how to run fast years ago, and we’d leave them in the dirt and laugh with all our teeth bared like fangs. We still loved glitter and ghost stories. We still loved riding our bikes down to the 7/11 for slushies, mine red and hers blue so we could mix them and make purple, watching them melt on our tongues in the heat of summer. Chrissy tattooed a shooting star on her wrist with a needle, and her momma cried and said she was going straight to Hell, before she burst out laughing, realising how ridiculous that was, and Chrissy just laughed along with her, because she knew there are far worst things to do than put the night sky on your arm. 

Travis’s dog Buster knocked up the neighbours Bichon Frise and dropped a litter of puppies right before Halloween, and we loved running round the backyard with them once their eyes opened and they found their feet, chasing leaves and birds as the air turned cold. I helped Chrissy dye her hair bright pink in the bathroom sink one evening just after Valentine’s Day, snow falling outside, music turned up loud enough to block out the sounds of her parents fighting with Luanna for getting herself knocked up just like the neighbours dog, by one of the boys from the autoshop. We loved sharing bottles of Malibu and whiskey we’d steal off my mom, and we loved setting off bottle rockets in the backyard and screaming and spinning in circles underneath the trails of sparks like they were shooting stars, spinning and spinning and spinning until we fell down laughing. 

When I sixteen, Chrissy was sixteen. 

And when I was seventeen, Chrissy was still sixteen, because one night in August, Chrissy was riding her bike home and a man was waiting for her, on the side of a dusty backroad that should have lead home, and not to her death. He dragged her off her bike as the sun went down above the trees and the sky burned orange. And he chased her through the woods with a hunting knife, the kind you use for the soft belly of a deer, only this time the chase wasn’t pretend. It wasn’t running from boys on the playground anymore. It wasn’t human, it was animal. Primal. And Chrissy had spent her whole life running. And she was fast, and she was strong, and she was brave. She ran so fast through those woods, like she was chasing horses, kicking up dust, like she could grow wings from her shoulder blades and just fly away. 



She almost made it. She almost fucking made it. But she didn’t. 



When I was eighteen, Chrissy was still sixteen, because she died alone and scared, in the dark in the woods and I wasn’t there. And he smashed her head in with a rock and did things to her body while she was choking on her own blood that I can’t even think about. And I wasn’t there. 

And when I was twenty two, Chrissy was still sixteen, because she died, and I didn’t, and I miss her every single day when I wake up, and some nights when I can’t sleep, I wish it had been me. I miss her in the summer, and I miss her in the winter, and I will never stop missing her, even when she’s right here next to me. She wasn’t like my sister, she was like my conjoined twin. We were fused. She was my family, my blood pact, my pinky promise, spit and swear it forever, one half of our secret handshake, the leader of our pack of two. Wherever she was, was where I would be. And then she was gone. 



I used to think that when she died, all the love went with her. But it’s still here. You need to know about the love, I think, to understand the rest.



It took them 4 days to find her body. They say God took 7 days to make the world, but it only took 4 days for our own to collapse. Every day Chrissy’s mom and all her Uncles and Aunts and cousins drove their trucks around Marren, handing out photos, kicking down doors, calling in favours, searching for her in strangers beds and basements, screaming at our small town cops to do better, look closer, crawl on their knees for traces of her. Every day Luanna sat in the police station with my Aunt Jane, waiting for news, belly heavy in her hands, phoning hospitals all the way to state lines for any girl with pink hair, green eyes, stars on her skin. Every day Travis and their daddy went out with all their hunter friends, trucker caps covering worried eyes, old ladies from church in their hiking boots, kids from school with shovels, dragging the woods and the lakes and rivers, searching for that pink hair half-buried in the dirt or floating in a creek like reeds. 

But I spent that entire week sat on Chrissy’s front porch, just waiting for her. Someone needed to be there when she got back. I would be there when she came back, and then we could laugh about it. I wanted to laugh about it with her. I slept out there with Buster the dog, every night, just waiting, because I knew she was going to come home. Buster would howl, long and lonesome like the world was ending because Chrissy wasn’t here, and I knew exactly how he felt. He sounded just like my heart. 

Sometimes Travis would join me and we’d sit shoulder to shoulder in silence, waiting, until he got restless and found his way back to the woods. Once, Chrissy’s mom tried to make me go home, called my Aunt Jane to come get me, then changed her mind. In the end she just sat out there with me, passed me one of her Newports, her eyes glazed over, hands shaky, clutching her rosary and a bottle of beer. I knew she wished more than anything I was Chrissy sat beside her, my body buried in the woods or rotting in the trunk of a car instead, and I wished it too. Blew the cigarette out like a birthday candle, and wished, and wished, and wished. 

I dreamt about Chrissy, running through the woods, and I would wake up in a sweat so heavy it was as if I’d been river baptised, terrified of the dark without her. Without her there was no light left. She’d been the sun, and now everything was shadows. And then on the fourth day I woke up, and she was there, watching me sweat, standing over me with her beautiful face half smashed in, blood in her pink hair, smile on her face. She knelt down and she laughed at me for still being scared of the dark like a little kid. I fell back asleep. 

And when I woke up for the second time, Chrissy’s mom was standing over me with those same evergreen eyes, face so similar for a moment I thought it was Chrissy again. She very gently told me that they’d found her, and that I should go back to sleep, before she walked into the house. I heard her screaming from the kitchen and she didn’t stop for a long time. 

Travis and their Dad had been the ones to find her. Slowly rotting, with maggots in her belly, blood fading to a dark maroon. All her Daddy wanted to do was carry her out of the woods in his arms, small like a child still sleeping, the way he’d carried her out of the hospital when she was born. But he saw her and he could only think - crime scene. His little girls body, now a crime scene. His little girl, now just a body. Travis told me, later, his Dad had howled and beat his hands bloody on one of the trees waiting for the cops, fighting the urge to go to her, clawing at the dirt, staggering, pleading for them to hurry up, terrified every second gone was more time wasted, more evidence fading. 

Travis just sat, on his knees in the dirt like he was praying. Doesn’t remember how he got to the ground. Kept waiting for her to get up. Yelling at her, to just get up, mad she was making their Dad so upset. Travis called an ambulance, begging for them to hurry, they could still save her. Watching the maggots crawl in her belly, the blood crack around her mouth. They could still save her. She just needed to get up, and she’d be okay. They could still save her. And when the cops came, leading his Dad away, trying to bandage his hands, hanging out yellow tape, they pulled Travis up, dragging him away when he wouldn’t move. Couldn't move. And he just kept thinking that he wasn’t the one that needed to get up. She was. She would. She had to. They could still save her. He could still save her.

Travis told me later when his Mom showed up that she just kept grabbing cops while they tried to placate her, saying over and over “That ain’t my girl, you’ve made a mistake. That’s someone else’s daughter. Somebody should call her poor mother so she’s not alone, she’ll be getting worried you see. I know how worried she must be, bless her heart. It’ll be dark soon, and she’ll start to worry about her daughter. You should call her, I can do it for you if it’s easier, mother to mother you know how it is. It’s ok I forgive you, everybody makes mistakes, but that’s not Christine you see, so we need to find her. That’s not Chrissy. We need to find my baby. You need to keep looking. Please just keep looking. That ain’t my girl. That ain’t my girl.” Kept saying it until there was nobody left to listen.



My best friend is dead, and there’s ain’t a damn thing either of us can do about it. But being dead has its perks. Chrissy says it’s hard to describe, as the dead don’t sleep and the dead can’t dream. But sometimes, a little like when your eyes unfocus, a little like when you wake up still half asleep and for a moment you can’t be sure if you’re awake or dreaming, Chrissy slips into a place she calls The Inbetween. It’s like dreaming, only it’s the truth. Things that could, or will, or might happen. Endless possibilities stretching out, that the dead can see and feel, because the possibilities that float through The Inbetween end in death. Death leaves a trail wherever it goes. It stains the fabric of the world, Chrissy says. It causes ripples in the universe. Leaves things dark. 

To be specific, Chrissy can see when someone is going to be killed. To be *really* specific, Chrissy can see when girls around her age or abouts, are going to be abducted, or violated, or brutally murdered, just like she was. I don’t know why. She can’t explain it. She says it would be like trying to explain breathing if you’d never had lungs. She says it’s like muscle memory, for muscles and memories I don’t have. She says since she died, it’s like she was born knowing these things. They’ve always been in her heart and in her head, it’s just now she’s dead that she can see them clearly. Like the fog has lifted. She say’s it’s like a feeling in her now non-existent ghostly gut, but sometimes she slips through to The Inbetween and comes out with these visions. They start hazy, but the closer and closer the days get to the murder, the clearer the visions become, like a camera focusing. The fog lifts, and she can see the name and the face of the victim and the killer, until she can feel their thoughts, taste their feelings, their possibilities. 



This is where I come in. The dead can’t dream, and the dead can’t sleep, but the dead also can’t touch. I would give anything to hold her one more time, but she just passes right through me, which is not a pleasant feeling, believe me. But the living can touch, and the living can also hold a gun, or a crow bar, or a shovel. Which I do. The living can bury bodies and bleach blood off the tile grout, and burn evidence in a trashcan in the backyard. Which I also do.



 Don’t get me wrong, I don’t often kill these men. I can still count on my hands the amount of people I’ve killed, although I’m starting to run out of fingers. Sometimes I can put a payphone and some pocket change to use, can anonymously tip off police and get them arrested before they can do any damage. Sometimes I can stall my car in traffic and make them just 5 minutes late, and it changes everything. Sometimes I just have to drop a threatening letter in red sharpie saying “I’m watching you motherfucker” through their front door and they become so paranoid they don’t act on anything. Sometimes I can get to the girl first, convince her to be somewhere else that night, or just stop and talk about the weather for long enough that they walk down the street at a totally different time than they would have, and the man that was going to kill them with a claw hammer walks right by without noticing them. 5 minutes can change the entire goddamn universe in ways you wouldn’t believe. 



Last month, I spent five minutes with a girl named Lorelei Lucas. I was wearing white jeans and I’d carefully smeared a little blood across the back of them and walked past her in line at the grocery store. Chrissy had seen Lorelei Lucas and her bouncy dark hair and her chipped front tooth and her secret dreams of becoming an architect floating out there in the Inbetween. She’d seen her kindness, the overflowing love she had for her little sister, her deep belief that what you put out you get back. So I walked past her where she stood in line holding a paper bag of red apples and a box of pink wine. Lorelei’s hand had flown to her mouth, smudging her peachy lipgloss a little and she’d reached out and grabbed my elbow. “Oh honey, stop a sec?” She’d said. I’d looked at her, miming my confusion, wide eyed. “I think your Aunt Flo has come for a visit a little early” she’d whispered loudly and kindly in her bayou drawl, gesturing down at my jeans. I’d turned round and looked, gasped, feigning mortification, and she’d just smiled and slipped off her red cardigan and tied it round my waist without hesitation. 

Lorelei was only a year older than I was, yet as she tied the sleeves, her hands steady and sure, I suddenly felt so small, like she was my mother taking care of me. The world slowed for a minute as I watched her french tip nails, the little gold heart on the ring looped round her pinkie finger. It’s hard to remember sometimes with all that I do, that people can still be kind, for no other reason than that’s who they are. I’d protested, and she’d just shaken her head, and smiled. “Naw, you keep it honey,” she’d said. Again I felt like she was my mother smoothing my hair back, setting the tipped up world back to rights. “You just pay it forward somehow.” When I thanked her, I wasn’t pretending. I meant it. If only she knew how I was paying it forward. 

Chrissy had seen flashes of that same red cardigan in an evidence locker, nearly black it was so bloodstained and tattered from where Lorelei Lucas had been stabbed repeatedly through the stomach with a rusty copper pipe and ripped open, left in pieces on the floor of an abandoned dairy barn. 

But because she stopped me in the grocery store, because she was kind, because she couldn’t stand to ignore someone that needed help, she didn’t walk home down the road that would have taken her past a dusty black van. She didn’t stop for the man leaning out of the back, pleading with her to help his little daughter inside. She didn’t stoop through the van door and she wasn’t met with a solvent soaked rag across the face. Her hands and ankles weren’t duct taped together, her underwear wasn’t cut from between her legs with kitchen scissors, and she wasn’t driven out to a dilapidated barn that would be the last place she ever drew breath, that little gold ring on her finger turning red in her guts as she fought to hold her stomach together, intestines unspooling around her.

Instead, she saw a girl that needed help, gave me the cardigan off her back, and it reminded her so much of middle school and her sister that she called her up. And they hadn’t spoken much lately, life getting in the way, but they laughed so hard on the phone about growing up, they decided that they missed each others faces and decided to meet up and reminisce some more over spiked ice teas and green salsa. So Lorelei Lucas walked the other way home to her sisters house, and spent the night drinking pink wine and laughing and playing all the songs they’d loved as kids as loud as the speakers would go, dancing round the kitchen until the neighbours banged on the walls to turn it down. 

And the man in the dusty black van sat on that street waiting until a cop car cruised past and spooked him so bad that he sped on the way home, wasn’t watching the road, and ended up driving that dusty black van straight into a quarry ditch. And it wasn’t a bad crash, he would have been a little banged up but fine, if it wasn’t for the bottle of chemical solvent that spilled, that soaked rag catching on the sparks and smoke from the crushed engine and setting the van alight in seconds. He never did manage to open the door, stuck against the quarry rocks on the other side, fighting beneath the air bag and twisted seat belt, the very things meant to keep him safe used against him. He was dead in 5 minutes. Just five minutes, and nothing but charred flesh and blacked bones, with nobody to bear witness but a ghost of a pink-haired girl who stayed and watched to made sure he burned all the way down to nothing. Funny how it works, ain’t it. What you put out, you get back. 

What you get, you pay forward. 

The thing is, sometimes, 5 minutes isn’t enough. Some of these men are like bottomless black pits straight into hell, infinite and unrelenting and evil. They won’t stop for anything. They’re like darkness as the sun goes down; you can try and outrun it, but the night still comes. You can’t tip off the police because they hide it too well. They’re too charming, or too careful, or too practised. You can’t convince their victim to be somewhere else that night, or make her late, or make sure he never walks past her, because he will simply just choose another girl. He will *always* choose another girl. It doesn’t matter if you change things by 5 minutes or 5000 minutes, they will never, ever stop. Their possibilities ripple through the universe, like black rot spreading, like poison in the water. As long as they’re alive, the poison spreads, and there is no cure. Sometimes, they need to die. Sometimes I have to suck out the poison, even if it means tasting some myself. And I do it. 

Whenever I’m washing out blood from the cracks in my nails that belonged to a man who had a penchant for school girls, or stitching up a split lip and a hole in my shoulder from a fight I almost lost with a chainsaw-wielding psycho (long story), or straining the muscles in my shoulders from digging a hole big enough to drop a body into, I think about the girls. The life they get to live, never knowing it was almost taken from them. 

They get to grow up. They get to fall in love with the boy or girl next door and get married in a white dress and have babies they’ll name after their favourite flowers. They get to be heartbroken and divorced, smash wine glasses against their bedroom walls and total their ex-husbands cars. They get to be high school drop outs with a DUI and a suitcase full of broken dreams - but they still *get* to dream. They get to be doctors and lawyers and firefighters, strippers and preschool teachers, ballerinas and bar tenders, artists and addicts, cocktail waitresses and congresswomen. They get to drink too much, and try too hard or not at all, and fuck everything up, over and over - and they get to try again, and again, every single day. All the beautiful, terrible, wonderful fucked up mistakes that make up a life. They get it all. 

They get Christmases and Hanukkahs and New Years and Diwalis. They get car crashes and college graduations and coffee in the morning made by someone that loves them. They get black eyes and break ups and best friends that drive all night just to see them and pick up the pieces. They get to sing off-key with the windows down as they drive home from jobs they hate, and come home to people that bought them pastries from their favourite bakery just because they knew they were having a shitty day. They get to call their Mom on her birthday, and they get to hug their little brothers goodnight, and they get to fight with their older sisters over the remote, and they get to cook dinner with their Dad on his day off. 

They get to swim in the ocean, and catch snowflakes on their tongues, they get fireworks and birthday cakes and weddings and funerals. They get to feel the rain on their face and sun on their skin, and watch the seasons change. They get wrinkled and grey and old, and they get to live long enough to forget what it’s like to be sixteen, and every single second is a gift they don’t even know they’ve received. They get to die old and content and surrounded by loved ones, or old and mean and alone, but it doesn’t matter either way, because they get to die when they’re meant to. On their terms. On their time. Not because of a man who decided to rip them out of the life they should have lived. 

We never really get to see the girls again, once we save them. It’s almost the hardest part sometimes, saving the life of someone who will never even know you exist. They walk past me like a stranger and they never look back. They don’t know I’ve killed for them, and I don’t get to know what they will do with the life I’ve given back to them. And they never even see Chrissy at all. 

But sometimes, Chrissy gets little flashes that fall through The Inbetween like shooting stars, bright and burning and exploding with light. Flashes of lives that shake the universe a little. One girl who would have been kept in a basement tied to a pole until she starved to death, grew up and became a surgeon; she had a bad temper and was never around enough to save her marriage, but she saved so many thousands of lives that she made ripples in the universe, glowing and soaking up the spreading poison like an antidote. One girl who would have been cut into little pieces and scattered along the highways in black refuse sacks grew up and became a single mom and stripper; she had a mean right hook, and a fuckin’ foul mouth, and she was unrelentingly kind and generous and loving, a violent and unstoppable force of pure blinding goodness and love that touched the lives of everyone around her, so bright that it sent ripples through the universe like waves of sunlight on a beach, washing away a little of the darkness in everyone she met. The point isn’t if these girls grow up to be good, or bad, or both. The point isn’t whether one life is worth saving more than another. The point is that they are alive. The point is they get to grow up and make the choice to be good, or bad, or both, for themselves. 

Chrissy never got that choice. I did. And this is what I’ve chosen. And I’d choose it over and over and over. 

And so that August morning, laying side by side on my bed, discussing the murder of a man who’s name I didn’t know yet with my dead best friend, I was thinking about choices.

I (19M) have a peculiar relationship with coffee. 

* I have no health problems, and I'm in pretty good shape (though I doubt this has something to do with my ""problem"").
* I take no medications
* I am not lactose-intolerant either. 
* I never drink alcohol
* Some people in my family are lactose intolerant

I rarely drink coffee except with my aunt's shortbreads, but when I do, I end up bloated, get slightly nauseous, and start feeling slightly dizzy. I drink my coffee as a latte. The weird thing is I used to occasionally drink energy drinks with caffeine in them and had absolutely zero problems. 

  
I looked up caffeine intolerance and I don't have the main symptoms they mention (anxiety, faster heartbeats, headache), so I wonder is it possible that I am intolerant to coffee itself instead of the molecule? I that a thing? I'm looking forward to answers about that because, even though it's not an emergency at all, I'm curious as to what I could have.

I wind my way between armor and embers, try to remember, remember the day before yesterday. Almost, a dream. That day. Those sweet, softly yellow moments with you.

The moon drifts towards me through the rain, fogging up. Two beautiful headlights light my way; and underneath them smiles a heart in grasping rose petals, a little amber, a little milky, a little like a hand. 

The moon rises on the balcony, and I invite myself in. Exhales, pulls me inside. Tingling ankles, and I ignite; here, we are alone. I'm real, you're the most beautiful revelation, tell me, more; bring me home. 

There's cold coffee for shy children with helpful mouths. In space, deafening promises, raging tides for every smile. I'm inside waterfalls between works and roles, flowing like floral wire, your voice is the soil that keeps this foil-brain steady, growing. 

Sweet is the coffee in the tin; you saw me drink it in the summer. Slowly, small hints leap out, burn photographs through the cortex, question marks, and always, those three little dots. There's so much of us, we are an entire ocean, and we swim in the evening sun.

No, don't leave. Take me home, take me anywhere.

Your left arm wraps around me, the world stops spinning. This sunflower had never felt the moon's cheek on hers before, never had her palm known the dephs of royal blue sea, there, between your shoulder blades. 

Ah, you. I'm scared, everything fades so fast here, where I betray my heart, I forget, I forget so much. I must preserve, write. You are real, and that day, real was my mind. There's a broken compass that hammers against my ribs, spinning slowly towards me now.

1g2auwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/lisathepainfulrpg/comments/1g2auwi/vegaful_sample_update_3_present_demons_encounter/,Vegaful Sample Update 3: Present Demons Encounter,"i have no idea where else to put this information besides a youtube comment because i hate discord. anyways there's a lot of difficult to find encounters in vegaful's SUs and all of them have crazy bangin tracks. this is one of the hardest ones to bruteforce encounter but you can find it at any point in the game, seemingly, so long as you've access to a present. it seems to be significantly less difficult than Mick but notably more difficult than Peeve or the Ivory/Ebony Idols.

  
EDIT OVER WHILE I'M TESTING FOR CLARITY?: ok so this isn't just El Devilito, he was just the one that i encountered first. i don't know how many there are. the other one i've seen is named Felicidad Para Ir. if you encounter one lemme know and i'll add it to this



to encounter El Devilito, you need to interact with a present. every time you interact with a present in vegaful - i have not looked at this update in-engine so this is theorycrafting - an event script presumably runs, giving you a random outcome from a list of outcomes. these effects include, from memory:

* getting Iced Coffee
* getting Mystery Jerky
* getting an Empty Bottle
* getting Party Liquor
* exploding, dealing 100 damage to your entire party
* saying ""nothing...""
* encountering a bossfight.

there are probably others i'm forgetting but those are the gists. these likelihoods are significantly weighted, but i'm pretty sure any present in the game can result in any outcome. i would assume the weights to look something like

  
Getting an item: 40%

Exploding: 40%

Nothing: 19%

Bossfight: 1%

  
so the odds are not in your favor. there are two ways to ""farm"" presents, one requires a tactfully placed save, the other involves you sleeping under lardy's truck, which is very boring and tedious and will result in your stats shifting around and you occasionally getting xp.

in order to farm presents without losing hair, save \*before\* picking up any of the 3 presents after the piano truck where you first fight Sneaky Peeve; there's a save crow directly to the right of the truck. pick up all three presents, then reload until you get the fight. it will take a while. if you die to the boss, you get booted to the overworld with 1 health, so if you encounter it by chance (i forget if the run option is disabled during it) you can just let yourself die and you won't lose any resources.

  
an aside, the other superboss (Mick) in this update is fought if you have at least two TNT in the rando area. go up the rope you need to pay to access, interact with the hole in the wall before the locked door, then interact with the tree. 

for fighting present demons,

* Devilito is a shotgun-type enemy encounter. he will instagib a party member if he's Scoped next turn, so try your hardest to stun, blind, or confuse him. i don't know what ""cocked"" does but it looks really fuckin' cool.
* Felicidad has absurdly high DEF and S.DEF, and only seems to attack by doing a draining bite attack which does high damage, heals him for just as much, and can afflict both poisons. he either requires extreme luck to break his jaw/stunlock him or for you to be very late into the game (having killed pretty much everything else accessible in this version) to have high enough stats to hurt him. DEF/S.DEF doesn't work against the bite. you'll just have to apply DOTs to him and let them tick while he's stunned. Gay Firebombs can help a lot i would assume but i haven't fought it on a file that has them and he might be immune to confused for no reason.

for fighting Mick,

* do this at the very end of the game when you've done everything else and make sure you have a good stock of items. the most effective strategy i noticed was using Silk Hat (if you have a 3rd TNT, go to the breathers' base, and explode the little indentation at the top right of the exterior) on Jerry, making him drink a Creamy Cocola Cola to gain ironbody + hella DEF, and then making him the aggro tank while everyone else gets rid of the adds via firebombs/Johnny fire skills. it is also extremely helpful if you can break Mick's wrists or Gouge him, as it essentially disables his ability to hurt you (broken wrists will only allow him to bite & think, the bite is significantly less lethal than anything else & think is a turn-waste).
* >!in his second phase, you are not out of the woods yet at all and you need to scum this out or else you will instantly die. he has significantly less HP and can actually be hurt with things other than DOT but you need to be spending your turns stunning him. he gets an instant kill move (only had it hit Jerry so don't know if it removes party members, probably does) which can null the ironbody strategy if you're unlucky. use everything & the kitchen sink to make sure everyone is at full health and that Mick is unable to act. Counterattack from rando rations & Fancy Perfume can be your only hope if he decides to do a particularly oppressive attack string. you have nothing better to use items on, so dump them all into his face immediately or else you will die. violently.!<

I think about her all the time. I wonder where she is and how she’s doing and whether her dog still snores. But, if I saw her stepping down a grocery store aisle towards me, I would turn and walk away.

I still laugh to myself at our inside jokes, and I think about her every time I put on that particular sweater, and somewhere in my house there are pictures of her still in their frames. But, if she called me tomorrow, there’s not one single chance that I would pick up the phone.

I think about her when it snows or when I eat good sushi or drink a really amazing single malt scotch.  I think about her when the leaves turn orange and red, and sometimes I can still hear her voice in my head. Sometimes I run into our mutual acquaintances, and I don’t ask about her because I just don’t want to know her anymore.

I want her to be happy, and I want her to have all of the wins. I want her to get out of bed in the morning and feel the sunlight on her cheeks, and I want the coffee she drinks to be not-too-hot, but she isn’t on my Christmas card list anymore. She’s just not invited into my life anymore, even though we were friends for decades.

Sometimes a crack turns into a sever and a sever turns into an amputation, and even though phantom pains still haunt my insides, I’m still glad that she was excised.

Friendships are funny I guess. We’re all adults, and we’re all out here trying our best, and we’re all failing sometimes.  I guess that means we’re failing each other sometimes too. I think we don’t mean to … no, I think we really do mean well, but sometimes people become collateral damage, and that’s really just a fancy phrase for, “I’m sorry I somehow lost you while I was triaging my own self worth.”

I think it must be okay to say that I miss her sometimes, but no - that doesn’t mean I want to know her anymore. I think it must be okay to say that I miss her sometimes, but this new version of me - this version that’s a little more whole and a lot stronger and a tiny bit lighter - well, she doesn’t have room for friends who carry words for weapons pointed at the backs of others, or worse, indifference about the effect of weaponized words on others.

This new version of me simply turned the corner and walked the other way.

And it was all okay.

I do hope to keep the TV in this room but I’m totally lost with ideas on making this feel “cosy”. 

I have a glass coffee table that’s not pictured and have ideas for a round rug that’ll contrast the floors.

1g2apyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g2apyu/why_would_a_guy_unmatch_and_ignore_me_but_not/,"Why would a guy unmatch and ignore me, but not remove me as a friend on Snapchat?","I (24F) matched with this guy (27M) two weeks ago on Tinder and we quickly moved to Snapchat. Our conversation was platonic, but we texted daily since then even just to say ""Hey I had a busy day sorry I am just now responding."" We got along well, had enough in common, but also some differences that I felt were fine, and would exchange pictures of our cats or whatever activity we were in the middle of.

We finally hung out on Tuesday and met up at an antique warehouse after I got off work, at his recommendation. Following we grabbed coffee and talked for maybe an hour or so? While we sat he was a bit antsy and at times got slightly distracted by his phone, but would quickly catch himself and put it away. We did talk about what we are looking for and he was unsure - mentioned having a hook up phase, some bad serious relationships, maybe even polygomy because his sister is in a successful poly relationship. I straight up told him I'm mongomous, but am down for FWBs or relationships and am openly submissive with my partners. There were normal awkward silences, but the conversation flowed and we discussed hanging out this weekend for ""Netflix and chill."" 

Tuesday night I sent him a video of my cat and he responded, but made no other attempts to talk. Wednesday I wished him a happy day. Thursday I said I hope everything is okay. Saturday I asked, ""So you're not coming over this weekend?"" His profile disappeared from my messages on Tinder, so he either unmatched or deleted his profile (I'm suspecting the former). He has not removed me as a friend on Snapchat, but is not opening or reading my messages. His icon has the active green dot though, so he's been on recently. Why would he suggest Netflix and chill - which I was down for and invited him to my place - but then unmatch me on Tinder, however not remove me as a friend on Snapchat? Nothing glaringly wrong happened that I could tell. I'm not sure if this is a hint I should take and remove him from my friend list, or wait it out a week and see what happens.

1g2aow9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1g2aow9/first_online_typing_curious/,First online typing! Curious :) ,"I've been reflecting on myself for a while, but I never really asked others for their input—aside from getting some suggestions about my MBTI type and Enneagram a few years ago. One person did recommend that I look into tritypes, but most of my understanding has come from introspection. I'm curious now to see how others would type me, especially those who don't know me personally and can offer unbiased thoughts based on my responses.

I have tried to be as complete (and concise) as I could, and I might have been incomplete regarding my answers. Feel free to ask away! Good luck :) 

  
p.s. I haven't rewritten the text (few misspellings; prolly missed a few still) . This is as raw as it can be, fresh out of my brain :D No filter! I thought it a good idea for this purpose! 

**•  How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**

I'm a 28-year-old woman with brown hair and hazel eyes. I dress in a mix of timeless and bold styles—I'm not afraid to try unconventional looks but usually prefer something classic, especially since I work in a commercial field! (and I just look good in it lol :D) 

**• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**

No. I don't think so. Though I did struggle with a difficult childhood which threw me into a mental inbalance so to speak. Some thought I might have emotional dysregulation, but looking back, I realize I was just a hurt, BULLIED kid with absent parents. My mental health improved in university when I had a fresh start, mostly because I was daring enough to just allow myself to be myself, and I now consider myself pretty stable. Someone who makes friends pretty quickly and someone with whom most people feel comfortable talking with (at least I think so).

**• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**

As I said my childhood was very rocky. Religion wasn't part of my upbringing. My dad and mom split up when I was around 8 y/o. My dad moved back to the UK (I am half UK/half Belgian), and I stayed with my mom. I saw my dad scarcily obviously since he moved so far away. He was mentally not 100%, and suffered from clinical paranoia and some hallucinations. Had a lot of health complications which led to a fairly uncomfortable visits when I grew older (since I started to see what was kind of ""wrong"" so to speak, but I did love my dad obviously). He passed away two years ago. My mom kinda found her ""new life"" after the split, and wasn't home as much. AAs a result I had to do a lot of housework, and be the big responsible sister to my younger brother starting when I was 11 y/o. As I mentioned before, I was bullied at school. With the absence of my mother, I suppose it didn't do any good to our mother-daughter bond, and I never really connected with her over my childhood. As a result, I didn't really tell anything about whaat happened at school because... well it didn't feel right? In the meantime my mom met my stepdad. I actually get along with him pretty well, if he isn't prying and nitpicking at all the wrong things I do. He critized me a lot, especially about my results in school. I am in comparison to kids and fellow students actually quite intelligent, and it didn't take me much effort to get A's and A+'s as marks on any subject really. But I was heavily motivated by my interests, which resulted me in not getting A marks all over. And obviously - you're still a kid. Sometimes you just let it slip right? So a lot of criticism from home: ""get better marks"", ""do the household"", ""take care of your brother"", while they were absent for like 80% of the time. This also while I was heavily bullied at school until I started university. 

Mostly I kept by myself and had a lot of distractions I found fun: drawing, gaming, reading. Basically. I used to draw and paint A LOT. When I waas like 14 or something, I found my way into gaming and liked escaping into this fantasy world that was a whole other reality. To my parents, it was responded by mostly anger or fits. I was very good in finding good comebacks that hurt them, but I always felt deep remorse afterwards. I aalways apologized. As I grew older (15 and up give or take) I started relativising, aand maybe even understandiing my mother a bit too much. I could see why she was enjoying her life, and I guess now Ive come to a point where I just know she shouldn't have had kids with my real dad when she did. SHe wasn't ready, and still isn't. Its still no excuse for what she did, or how she treated me and my brother (I mean, I was basically the maid that sitll had to be a perfect kid) - but it does give me a bit of a thinking frame to accept it somehow. 

In some way or another, I was still able to be a positive and upbeaat person doing the things I liked and talking with the people I could to (which wasn't a lot tbh). I kind of give myself some credit for it, because its aalso this thaat kept me through the later phase in my life when I aactually ran aaway from home (but I waas already 21 at this time). It made me able to see the possibilities, and work towards a realistic solution. It made me the person I am today! And look now, I am happily engaged and bought a home with my fiancé. We have two fantastic dogs, and are still a happy, stable and comfortable couple. I don't have much contact with my mother anymore, I see her once or twice a year, and we text maybe an occasional 8 times a year. 

Honestly, there's much more to unfold, but its such a complicated past (until I was like 23 or so) that it would take me 3 reddit pages to just type it all out without flavour lol. 

**• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**

It was a difficult thing to find for me;, and I still feel like I am looking for my ideal point in my career. I studied product engineering/design with user experience and graphic design as a major. I am a very creative person, aand I breathe ideas. I am really good at motivating others for a common cause, and I am especially good at finding solutions for a lot of problems (I wanted to say any, but I mean, thaat would be a abit hubris xd).  I started off in Real Estate as a Client Representative (someone who took everyone through their decisions), but I found the administration too tedious and life draining. I waas very eager for more variablity and creativity. This eventually led me to an interior architect job for a kitchen company. I am very happy with my job, I get plenty of creative cases and can use my calculus brain to think of price-efficient solutions, or just general calculus for thinking out the pricing. I still crave the graphic design work, so I am heavily opting for doing a side hustle and make logo's, posters, general branding and whatnot. 

**• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**

Depends, if I was a whole week busy interacting with people, it would be a welcome gift. But if I was working quietly on my own, then I would aabhor it. I like to be aaround people, and reacharge my baatteries with what I like to do on the side (I still play some games, or do some side activites like running). I am fine keeping myself entertained, but I also like to have a laugh with people to break the rythm of my constantly thinking brain and just have a lighthearated conversation. 

**• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**

I like reading, drawing and gaming. I also like running, skiing and snowboarding. I am actually really good at drawing, and surprisingly (I didn't know this until I was 26) very very good at running. I was also a natural aat skiing and snowboarding actually. I suppose, aand I didn't realise it until I was writing this, I am actualaly quite good at sports. THis is a surprise to me because it waasn't always an evident ""let out"" for me. 

**• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**

I am EXTREMELY curious. It's not because I want to meddle that I aask ""what happened"" or ""what are you thinking about"" or ""whats that"". Its simply because I am curious, I just wanna know. Its like this unknown fact that my brain wants to explore. I was the kid in class that asked the ""why"" questions or the questions thaat were already 3 steps ahead because I just explored the theme in my head already. I will always be curious, until I am in my grave I think. I suppose my ideas are mostly conceptual, but the world forces me to maake it practical (interior architect / product design and all that). I am curious about everything really, doesn't really matter what xD

**• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**

Enjoy is a weird way to name it, but I don't mind it. I prefer to give it up for someone who really wants to do it in my stead, but if I feel incompetence or ""holes"" in their approach, I'd subconsciously taake over by making a lot of suggestions to improve the situation. This wholly comes naturally tho, since I would never ask this myself - unless other people reaally want me to. I am very inclusive, I like to hear everyone's opinions and ideas to fuse it into the ""uber idea"" (lol) that really hits all the marks. There's in some waaay some kind of perfection to be found in that approach I really appreciate. I also like to keep the peace (most of the time) to keep ourselves productive for our common cause. I am a diplomatic person, that hears erveryone out aand comes with a compromise. I would never just put myself on top of others, or others on top of others, I truly believe everyone has their part, no matter how small, big, significant or insignificant. But I am also a leader that, when I am fed up with things (after having adressed them a few times), will come off a bit sharper in the style like 'could you please get your shit together and focus? We have x and y to do'. I like banter and jokes myself though, so it would take me a lot to get myself to this point lol. 

**• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**

If I focus, I am coordinaated. But it's not my ""default' state. As said before, I am actually good in most sports, so coordination when focusing is actually quite good. Drawing is kind of the same: I have good eye hand coordination, so I am very much in touch with how I move through space if I pay attention. However, if I do not, I am a ragdoll hitting lampposts and everything. I prefer working with my head, but I also like to see how it impacts other people in a positive way. 

**• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**

I am very artistic. I guess my art is quite ""classic"". I am very good at drawing people, especially when able to use just contrast. But I was, before I started working (less time), exploring colors more and then I realised I could go a whole other style that was still quite beautiful. It was ususally waatercolor style -ish or more abstract combination of colours that merges into one clear and creative image. 

I love thinking out concepts and drawing them out, too (mostly linework, things like dragons etc). 

I love playing with light, line thickness and color tones. I did two years art-school one midday a week, and I excelled at contrast work, because I liked to plaay with the idea of how light falls onto people, things, or imaginings. 

**• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**

The past cannot be changed, but is something you take along on your ride. It doesn't define you conclusively, but it does shape you to be the person today. The person todaay is the person who is in total control of her happiness and ability to work towards goals that she truly wants. Its also the person who doesn't have to get her act together instaantly, and can be forgiving to herself for not always being happy, perfect or creative or whatever I would want to be that day. The person today is what makes the person tomorrow able to do the stuff she alwaays dreamed of. 

I see them pretty intertwined, but not conclusive to eachother. I like to think that I can do as much as I can, as much as I want, to influence what happens and cater it to my own happiness and goals. 

**• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**

I love helping people to be honest. If I have to be completely transparant, its because it makes me feel like they value me. I don't help them for that completely though, I always ponder first if its something I myself would like to do. But I also don't mind, e.g. , making coffee for my colleague if I know she would do the same. I like living symbiotic, so to speak, and not singular. 

**• Do you need logical consistency in your life?**

Not really lol. I don't care, I don't even know how to elaborate. Consistency? What consistency? I always do what I want to do, no matter how old I am. Of course I won't run from responsibilities where others depend on me (I mean, I have dogs and a partner) but consistency? thats never the goal. Happiness is! 

**• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**

Not that important. Enjoyment leads to productivity for me, and if I am in a good flow, I am highly efficient. If I force these things, they just won't come. I have to enjoy whaat I do, and then I am the fastes oiled machine you'll see (I can be very very efficient and productive that way). I don't prioritize it, though of course, I understaand these are points you are looked on to, especially by your boss. 

**• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**

I do actually. Not that I really want to control THEM. And usually its not conscious either. But I do tend to see some ways of ideas, or some propositions better than others, and will try to navigate to that. This can lead to me controling others, although when I realise it will affect them in a negative way (even if they would feel bad about it e.g), I will stop immediately and seek compromise instead. I can do it subconsciously, and I will always prioritize inclusivity instead of the ideal goal I, myself, as an individual, see fit. I can be at fault too, and it often takes me bumping into discomfort to realise that. Unfortunately. 

**• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**

I talked about most of it already. I can elaborate a bit more on gaming: its something you completely control, where you can excel at, and where you can find enjoyment. All while not having to think about some things in life for just a little while (even when I am in a happy place btw, I just like the different mindspace). I enjoy sports (running/skiing) because it is a way to silence my thoughts that I constantly have. I have found by trial and error that this has a positive impact on my mind, and so I implement this happily in my life. I am also quite a good runner, so I mean, win win :) (litterally sometimes) 

**• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**

I have a good muscle memory - translates into picking up some handlings rather quickly or memorising written content pretty well. My best learning style is visual and auditive though. Lisenting to a professor and seeing a powerpoint = heaven. I litterally don't have to learn as much afterward anymore. Not sure if its a gift or a curse, but whatever ill take it lol. I enjoy creativity, and I do find myself finding ""creative"" ways to memorise stuff. Often rhymes or wordplay help me memorise things. 

**• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**

Definetly a tendency to wing it. But if needed I CAN break it down, I had to do so for my studies and for my job, so its not like I can allow myself to be honest. But I am an ideal employee for ""crisis"" cases where quick wit and creative solutions are needed for a good fix. I am quick on my feet, and surprisingly so, can be quite strategic. I do, if I am well prepared (!! big caveat), think forward easily if its part of the plan. ANd cater solutions to that future. I suppose I am worst at the ""manageable"" tasks part. I am procrastination queen, lol, which does put me in a pickle. However, ive never really had aa moment where the pickle became unmanageable. I always managed to work around it xD (knock on wood?) I suppose overall strategy/plan is deffo my thing, but the implementation is less so - although I can force myself to sometimes if needed. 

**• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**

Its quite simple aactually, just be happy and comfortable, doing things I want to do with happy people around me. 

**• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**

Fears? I suppose living a life I didn't really want. I fear of not doing the things I want to, I fear of not being happy. Because I believe everyone deserves a happy life, including me. I hope to live a full and fullfilling life and that I can have that effect on others. 

I don't really ""hate"" anything, aside from assholes on the road to work who don't know how to drive ;) xd

I don't like people putting themselves first at the cost of others/myself. Especially when they want to exploit me, I feel quite vulnerable and often feel myself shifting into this ""passive agressive"" mode. I actively battle agaainst it though, and instead choose to ask about their actions instead. 

**• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?**

Acquiring or doing things in life I wanted to, going happy to bed, getting up happy from bed. Being happy coming home, coming to work. 

**• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?**

Living more hermit like, deep delving into topics that are quite far fetched, while cricitizing myself with ""you should do this you should do that, or you HAVE ot do x or y, otherwise you're not a a worthwile person"". I am my own worst enemy pretty much, while I indulge so much in some things (escapism, can be food too tbh) which only makes it worse lol... 

**• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**

I suppose I am more of a daydreamer than a ""realist"". But I can often switch these modes quite easily, and due to my spontaineity, I blurt out the ideas in a goofy or funny way to my friends and colleagues. So in some way, I involve them with what was in my head, which makes it all the more fun! I am not that aware of my surroundings in my daydream state, no. 

**• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**

Bad things lol. That sounds like hell for me. I'd feel highly uncomfortable. Perhaps because I am confronted with myself then? With my vulnerabilities? My ability to not be at peace with my mind sometimes? Or that I am just deeply insecure while trying to find peace with that? Not sure, my mind goes a million miles an hour and makes me quite unsure about anything really. Just a cupboard would make me happy y""know. 

**• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**

Not long. Sometimes it can take longer (like a few days); but more often than not its quite instantaneously even. I never regret my choices actually, I suppose I am just very in touch with what I want and that I can envision it quite easily (with common sense most of the time) that I can make those important decisions quite fast. The thing that took me longest to decide was the buy of our house last year. It took me a week to decide - but I had to give up all my savings (remember I ran away from home, financial instability and whatnot...) in order for me to buy it. But eventually I did, and not regretting it of course. 

**• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**

All the ""emotion"" part comes naturally to me actually. It doesn't take long to process it, the question is often how. (I don't know the answer to that even now tbh). I believe my emotions are crucial to my life decisions and that without those, I wouldn't be able to make decisions that ultimately would make me a happy person. 

**• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**

Sometimes. I do it to keep the peace, but I'll try to build towards a ""safe space"" to share my opinion anyway. I cannot let it forego. I have to share it, as I feel like I have a right to. But I don't want to make feel people bad because of my opinions - and so I often try to find common ground to share it. I don't do this very often, usually I come with different topics naturally and find others following happily along (even the more introverted types!). I am quite a ""chameleon"" in that sense, because I can feel quite well how an other person prefers to have contact, and will adjust myself according to that person to make him/her feel comfortable. But I will never not share what I feel or think, just because the other might not agree. But there's art in communication...

**• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**

Sometimes. I believe rules were made for a reason and its good there are rules. But common sense and humanity can forego these rules imo, and so sometimes I find myself coloring outside the lines. Authority doesn't ""know better"", neither do I. It's more likely aa case of ""not knowing it completely"". I believe in human decency, and so I like to place my bets on the greater good.

He has a collapsing trachea that causes this and feeding him is such a chore. My mom has tried next to everything to help.. soft food/a feeding mat to help/ and now she uses a coffee grinder to grind hard food up to mix with his soft food to keep him from choking on it.

Now the Monday after, my phone gets shut off and I don’t have Wi-Fi or service. My family has been struggling financially. I thought everything was fine until I got Wi-Fi, I got an email saying I was removed from the group and need to start the project over by myself. 

I found this absolutely ridiculous but my group is refusing to take me back because it’s not fair to them. Even though I was crying to them basically begging them not to do this to me because it’s not my fault that I didn’t have access to my phone but all they care about was the fact it wasn’t fair to them. 

The professor keeps telling me it’s too late and telling me we can’t meet to talk about it for another week pushing me even further towards failure. 

Now they group I was with is a 2 person group and the professor emailed the whole class about it gassing them up and asking if anyone wants to help them and now I’m getting all these questions from my classmates. 

Even though I’m explaining I physically could not contact anyone I’m still getting punished for it. I’m extremely angry and want to just take the L and drop the class however it’s past the point where I can do without a W on my transcript

I’m just so pissed off, this has to be discrimination of some kind bro.

For context this is a film production class, the assignment is creating a whole ass documentary which I apparently have to do by myself and I don’t even have a topic.  

Edit: I have had many issues with this university. I fought for my financial aid, my accommodations, and my housing the last of which I gave up on and am now traveling 3 hours for. At this point I don’t think it’s worthy, but I’m a junior and transferring or dropping out don’t seem like good options. 

EDIT 2:

Since people are not understanding, I’ve been doing my portion of the work, I just didn’t have any contact with the group. People who aren’t in my situation where being late can be very very bad don’t understand I can’t really stop at a coffee shop to stand there and sign to the Wi-Fi to sign into my email to send one.

For some background, myself and a colleague are solely responsible for handling all things in the office on the weekend, so I work by myself a lot. My days off are Tuesday through Thursday. On Monday, the company posted on all the socials about how hard we work and their gratefulness for us. Then on Tuesday my boss apparently bought the team lunch and didn’t say a peep to me or my weekend colleague. Our boss sends a text Wednesday morning to our group exclaiming she’s bringing in bagels and coffee, again on my day off, and later texts that they’re buying pizza for everyone’s lunch on Thursday. When this first happened Wednesday morning, I sent a message in the group chat wishing I could be there, he didn’t comment at all. And then later after he sent the text about the pizza party, I messaged a different coworker complaining about the lack of acknowledgement for my work. The coworker asked our boss in the group chat what was being given to the weekend support, aka myself and coworker 1. Boss replied stating he had a surprise in store for us Friday.

Friday comes and we have our morning meeting. Guess what we got (And by we, I mean all of my department, not just a special surprise for the weekend team)? A certificate of appreciation and a five dollar gift card for coffee. 

I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but I do a lot more that what’s expected of me every day I’m in the office and I hoped there would be something nicer in store as a gift of appreciation. I had volunteers to work this weekend schedule more than a year ago and every day since then I’ve had to teach myself serious time management, multitasking and triaging what tasks are most important since working independently. For a good part of this year I was working alone with no additional support. I was offered a raise when my boss was looking for someone to take over the weekends, so there is that benefit. But I’d be grateful for a little more recognition of how much effort I put into my job and how I’ve produced a lot of good changes for the company. We’re doing business in the million-dollar range, so I doubt it’s a problem with budgeting giving back to employees.

I beged my dad to buy me a laptop so I can develop a game and help my family and I really need to help them in a short time. So he bought me a laptop and I started to develop a game but it was going to take more time then I thought. So I started to make a simpler game but I really think it's going to be a good game even tho it's simple. Anyways before I come today I want to tell you something I did one year ago. I was hanging out in a public beach with my friends and some of them were drunk. I really warned them not to go to water but they didn't listen and it was late time with no one can help if something happens.At some point I really thought one of them will die so I just started to pray that whatever the cost just no one does. When we got back to the coast everyone wasdsafe but among six of us just my phone was missing from our bags. Everyone was sad but I was really happy and gratefull that the cost of our lives was a phone. I started to the collage that time with the old phone(iphone5c) of my mom and I was still gratefull. Now as what happend today is I was celebrating our fist year with my girlfriend(we ate some good food and drank coffee I didn't have money to buy her a gift but I will definitely later) and when we were going to separate to go out dorms suddenly an old man in the tram station starting to act weird. First I thought that he was on something or just weird then I realized he is having some healt problems and no one was really caring. I really felt useles and just ran to the securitys and informedtthem. They were close and they called an ambulance but no one including me knew first aid so we just waited. At some point we did go before the ambulance came because I thought that we were just a weight for poor man. That thing really changed my mood for the rest of the day and I really prayed for him. I didn't think about the last year event but I still prayed that if there is a God he can take my hand(I don't know why I thought that) for his life. No one took my hand but when I got to the dorm my room mate said he is going to make me a coffee and I said I don't want it I don't have a glass. He insisted and used some long glass bottle for that. I was going to work on my game but I wanted to drink coffee first because I don't get any liquid to the near of my laptop but suddenly my girlfriend called and she said her stomach hurts probably from the chicken that felt raw to me and I said don't eat it to her. Anywayswshe is fine now but when we started to talk I took my laptop and coffe to the working room oftmy dorm because I don't have a table at the room(we are 6 guys and we have one table). When wesclose the call I suddenly spilled the coffee to the laptop. I closed it and turned it upside down but I think it's a gooner. I feel like this is the price for my prayers because I really need this laptop and I had a one time shot with it. I feel sad but I hope that old man will live a long and happy life with his family. I know that all these might seem irrevelant and unlogical to you, it actually is to me too in fact I don't really belive in God or any religion at all but sometimes only we have got in our hand is nothing other than hope. I know that I'm not happy but I'm not even close to the living worse I know that life is hard for everyone. Whoever reading this please don't give up, I might have lost my one shot but I'm not gonna stop and give up, I didn't really wanted to talk about this but everything I do is for a person I love that lsn't well so that's why i keep saying It might be my only shot.

My marriage was basically on its last legs. We even had a moment in the bathroom where I thought to myself, if this is the moment where my marriage ends I walk out the door right now. 

I can't even explain what made me stay, but instead we try to marriage counselor. I absolutely hated the entire process. I felt like I was being put on the spot and interrogated once a week for an hour.  If anything, it created another stress point in our marriage, because I did not feel that it was helping, and it was just another thing to fight about. 

Then I just happened to be looking around online reading articles and stumbled onto a [free course](https://www.freemarriagecourse.com/).  I started listening to it on my daily walks, and I'm not even exaggerating to say that it changed my life, because it completely changed my marriage. 

I'm the type of person who needs to take time the process things, so the idea of being put on the spot every week by a marriage counselor was just forcing me to retreat more (I later learned that men in particular often resort to stonewalling). As I listened to each lesson I thought more about how I could apply the tips they were giving, and more importantly I started examining my own behavior. 

I really took to heart the point that my happiness was something that I was responsible for and I couldn't get that solely from my spouse.  

From there I began to try to create some goodwill that had long since disappeared. I started making her coffee, cleaning up the house without her asking me, cooking her favorite meal and stuff like that. Before I knew it, she was thanking me for the things that I did, and I was thanking her for little things that she was doing.   

If you would have told me 5 years ago that I would still be married to the same person, I would have told you no chance. 

So for anyone out there who was in my position and thinks that the relationship is hopeless, I'm here to tell you that not only is it possible to turn things around, you can turn it around.  And you don't have to pay $250 per week to do it.

Sunday the 6th of October 2024 I got the call from his  S.O. that he'd had an accident. This happened in Germany while I was at work in Finland.

He shattered both femurs, hips and broke his left arm and unclear how many ribs. Do direct brain damage luckily but doctors are worried about the lungs and his kidneys. He was put on dialasys to protect the kidneys and a breathing tube was set with ventilator.

Today I arrived and got to see him...
It's critical but he is stable and is breathing almost completely on his own now. But he's gonna need a ton of surgery for his legs and doctors are telling me its a good chance he'd be bed ridden for the rest of his life. Knowing my dad, how he finds all joy in life by being able to work on his bike and ride it, or just you know being able to make his own damn coffee. It's hard when they ask me to come and that I am gonna have to decide what they do IF his heart stops for ex.

And considering the amount of anaesthesia from numerous surgeries and more coming, risk is great.

I don't think I could live with myself, seeing dad miserable in life because of a decision I made, but I couldn't imagine living without him either.
I stay 2½ days, during that time I have court and some time with my dad, try and get him to wake up.

When I arrived, I touched him and talked to him. He reacted and definitely heard me. Good sign.
But he has to wake up. They can't wake him.

I have a short visit, I might stay longer but I don't know. I am so lost, heartbroken, worried to death...
Might be easier with my support system at home.

So, we all know Bran has been acting way too chill in the later seasons/books, right? Like, yeah, sure, let's just sit in a wheelchair while Westeros burns and do nothing but stare. But what if… this was part of his master plan?

Bran wargs into GRRM. Boom. Suddenly George is at his keyboard like, “Well, guess I'll never finish this book. Maybe I’ll go write about food descriptions instead. Oooooh, another Dunk & Egg story!”

And every time GRRM gets close to writing an actual chapter of Winds of Winter, Bran’s like, “Nope, time to remind you about those lemon cakes, George.”

My theory is that this was Bran’s true endgame all along: ensuring that no one, not Jon, not Dany, not even Tyrion ever gets to know how their stories really end.

If Bran says, ""I’m the memory of Westeros,"" it’s because he’s the only one who remembers the ending. Because he warged into the one guy who can’t write it.

I've been married 21 yrs and it's getting worse. I am very blessed to have a husband who occasionally thinks of me. However lately, it's like he is not listening to me.

Here's just a drop in the bucket - two small examples from this morning alone:

We came back from vacation last night and I asked him not to do laundry. So while I slept, he put all the laundry in the machine, (stuffed at least two loads + more in at once without sorting for color or textile, added insufficient detergent for two loads, and then when I was shocked and disappointed when I got up and saw what he did and the mess I had to fix, he got defensive and stormed out of the house, accusing me of being ungrateful. And literally all I said was ""I thought I asked you to leave the laundry for me.""

Every Saturday he goes to a bakery to get coffee cake for breakfast with his mom and brothers. He gets me donuts I can't eat because I have digestive issues. So for the last four months I have been asking him every Friday to not get me anything at the bakery, and every Saturday morning there's a donut I end up having to throw out half the time.

I've tried saying gentle things like,
""I appreciate you thinking of me, I don't know if
you heard me last night, but you don't need to get me donuts, I can't eat them because of my stomach issues"" ....then again he gets ANGRY and storms out muttering under his breath again.

These are small and insignificant examples of larger issues.

I think he either doesn't listen to me, thinks he knows better than me, or both.

But I am SO SICK OF NOT BEING HEARD

AND I'm sick of getting yelled at, followed by the silent treatment that can last for days, when I try to rectify these repeated ""miscommunications"" assuming that's what they are and that he's not deliberately doing what I ask him not to.

AITHA for not just thanking him every time he does something wrong and letting him keep making the same mistakes over and over and over even when it causes me extra work and stress and waste? Am I really an ungrateful bitch?

One of the roommates is moving out unexpectedly (let’s call her roommate A) and the new roommate is moving in a week. So I want to set these ground rules with the new roommate and roommate B.

Rule 1. Separate kitchenware

Roommate A is taking all her plates and bowls so I asked Roommate B to bring her plates and bowls from her parents or buy new plates because I didn’t have enough for both of us (or three of us). I think she was under the impression that we were going to share our kitchenware because I noticed she started using my plates/bowls (she was using roommate A's before). I pretty much go through my plates/bowls with a few left before we run the dishes. I also think it's just easier if everyone had their own. She also doesn't seem like the type to take care of her kitchenware considering the conditions of her stuff. it’s been a week and she still have not brought any plates and bowls and is using mine even though I told her my set is not enough. I don’t want her to leech off of mine cause then she would just never go home and grab her plates. My hobby is also cooking so I tend to use a lot of dishes when I cook.

Rule 2: No shoe policy

We never officially established that this is a no-shoes household but Roommate B had told me she usually wears no shoes in the house and said I was the same. I went out to get us a shoe rack the next day. I noticed she occasionally still wears her shoes in the house. What triggered me was she was wearing shoes in the house one day after I told her I had just cleaned and mopped, so I found it to be very disrespectful. I clean weekly and want to maintain a clean space.

There are things I'm chill with. For example, I don't mind if I am the one cleaning every week. I will never ask them to clean as long as they clean up after themselves. But I think the least she can do is wear no shoes in the house. It also has been a month and I have not seen her clean once. Her bf came over for dinner and the next day I woke up to crumbs on the coffee table and all their stuff still left there. she also started leaving food in my designated shelf? I moved her stuff, am I a asshole for that? ? She also never put the dishes away. I can't tell if I'm being an asshole roommate and asking too much.

Not super into the night life, I’m more of a brunch or lunch person who likes thrifting, bookstores and coffee. Also into films and I collect VHS tapes and CDs for fun. 

I know there are so many upcoming events, but I’m absolutely indecisive, and I’m still adjusting to the area.

She fiddled in her garden daily, baked, went on girl dates, was the first one to the farmers market on Saturday and Sunday, did yoga and a boxing class for Parkinson’s patients, actively participated in the daily Jeopardy game screaming out the answers, snubbed her nose at bad coffee, went out for beers and fries with my dad after the live baseball games, and until recently, did puzzles, beading, and hosted brunches all through these years. She had more energy than an over-sugared 5-year old, and usually had a comparable relish for life.  She was non-stop. It was exhausting for the rest of us to be around her 🥰.  

But her periodic hallucinations and dementia episodes got worse and worse to the point that she was oblivious — or maybe obstinate is more accurate — to her physical limits and she finally fell so bad she was hospitalized with multiple pelvic fractures and a small brain hemorrhage. In the hospital, her decline accelerated and within days she lost most of her presence and ability to focus, converse, eat, drink, — or rest. She is in constant motion. She is agitated and she is strong. She tried to get out of bed multiple times even with pelvic fractures and no strong pain meds. She has periodic outbursts. It takes several staff to handle her for bathing, changing, blood draws… You can exchange one or two words with her, but it seems empty — most of the time she is hallucinating and constantly muttering nonsense, swinging her arms around, and kicking. She has stopped eating. She is in comfort care mode and we are moving toward hospice care. 

We want her to live her last days in the care of the lovely hospital staff. We think moving her will be too disruptive and we’re not sure a hospice could handle her constant motion and outbursts…unless they sedate her, which seems so sad. Thoughts about it from this community? Does anyone have any tips for how to get the hospital to agree she should live her finals days there rather than ship her off to a new setting? Or do you think a new setting would be good? Thank you for your thoughts and advice. ",1,1728768031.0,hospice,3,1.0,False

Honestly, I gave myself free range of the NRT to the point of almost maxing out the daily limits 😭

I kept having a psychological craving that was hard to explain, but I think it was just disappointment. 

Ahh finally off work, time to relieve my stress with a v-fuck, never mind.

Rise and shine, throat hurts, time to wake up with a coffee and my va-fuck, never mind. 

Wow what a nice meal. Time for my usual dessert of going to the bathroom and vape- NEVER FUCKING MIND

It’s like everything I did in my life was a sentence, and the vape was the period to end it. 

Day 12 (13?) without the device (and 5 w/o NRT) and I’m still experiencing this a bit, just not as frequently. It was happening almost every 15 minutes on day 1. Now maybe 5-6 times per day.

PROLOGUE

I am hopelessly lost in a dreamscape, my own little halcyon realm, where the mockingbird and I finally come to armistice. Softly I hear the pitter-patter of fae-feet like an echo, and my dream distorts. Wraiths disperse, voices still, and all lively things wither.
Not this early… Don’t wake me now.

More pitter-patter, and he struggles his way up the shelf. All is quiet, and like clockwork I am promptly roused from my rest as a book falls off its shelf with a loud thud. Shall I open my sleep-heavy eyelids to meet a sheepish gaze? Instead, I just sigh.

‘Sorry…’ comes the apology, whispered as the culprit hurries away with his find. Ever raucously dragging the hardcover along. Another sigh from me, and a rather bereft one at that, for my book.

Languorously I move my weary carcass to the side of my bed, letting my feet touch the floor scantily. Running a hand through my tousled hair I squint my eyes, how is any living being capable of finding mornings enjoyable? While I ponder and process the existence of daylight, I feel my way to the kitchen with short, listless steps and half-opened eyes.

“Oh no… who woke you from hibernation?” 

I muster up a glare to my cohort and source of sarcastic banter. “Take one good guess. No, daybreak be not the answer.”

“Hmm, let me think a little... was it perhaps a pesky little thief, such as the one passed here shortly with a book of your collection?” Kai laughed, looking in the direction of said thief, “Perhaps the Scoundrel that be Feran?”

One dismayed look from me confirmed his guess, and I seek out the kettle for coffee.

“Be the clock ticking, or has it come to standstill?” He enquires absentmindedly, little bothered with my woes.

“Sharp as a marble, aren’t you? Thinking I would possess this knowledge or a guess thereof.” I reply, stirring the mixture of black bitterness. “Its time doesn’t change the fact of discarding it.”

“Still… try to hurry. If only you didn’t avoid the daylight as if it’s the plague…”

“Oh dear, angry little early bird now, are we?” I raise an eyebrow and glance at him. “Or just morbid curiosity, I wonder.”

“Neither.” He replies, walking away to the door.

Why the haste… cadavers can’t run away. I think to myself, taking a big swig of the burning brew before sauntering to the door. “Let us be gone, before more of your gibberish meets my ear.” I motion to the door.

“Where are you going?” Feran inquires, running to the door. “Can I come with?”

Kai glares at him, crossing his arms. “We aren’t going anywhere of interest to you. And you know you can’t come with.”

“Why?” Feran sulks, pouting. 

“Don’t you have a book to read?” I glance at him contemptuously, opening the door and stepping outside.

“Yes… but I want to go with.” Feran retorted.

“Sad, you’ll have to stay behind this time.” Kai shooed him back as he closed the door. Feran mumbled angrily to himself, rambling as he trudged off to his book.

“Lovely one to deal with.” Kai muttered to himself, walking at a swift pace to catch up since I’ve already started walking along the path. Nothing quite like the smell of rain as the sun shone idly here and there, though still a bit bright to me.
“So… who’s turn is it this time? Surely you are the chosen.” Comes an interruption to my thoughts.

“Who, me? Couldn’t be.” I keep my eyes on the ground as I walk, observing the florae. “Surely, you speak absolute malarkey.”

“No, fellow speaker of nonsensical words, I speak great truths.” He intones, blithely following my steps.

“Then the task be mine, if that would so appease you.” We walk further in silence, enjoying the rare sunlight as it radiates its glimmers through the trees. Vivid colours these, too bright actually. Yet still scenic. When we draw near, Kai finds himself a place to bask in the rays, while I am off to do more grim things.

“Try not to take your merry time.” I hear him faintly as I pick my way down precarious footholds. As if I have any intention of listening.
I am soon lost in the duskiness of ferns, moss, and other such foliage which flourishes in wan light. Oh, the earthy ambience… and coppery blood.
Here, in the ghoulish caverns so slightly buried in earth, I nimbly approach a cold figure. Broken cadaver, I think to myself as I observe its lifeless form. Soon to be nothing more than mere dirt under the feet of the living.

CHAPTER 1

Faye watched the forest keenly as it flitted past, imagining herself between the calm woodlands. She was lost in a sense of euphoria as the late morning sun wavered between the spruces and larch. Startled by a sudden movement as the old train stuttered over its tracks, she returned from her musing.

She was alone except for the woman next to her reading a book, and Faye found herself with only her thoughts for conversation. Unpleasant situation, to say the least.
She returns her scrutiny back to the window, and a sense of self-pity crawls over her like a multitude of insects. Why did Mae have to leave her to go on the trip alone?
A sulky sigh escapes her, of course something just had to come up at work. They’ve planned this trip for ages, and then Mae has to stay behind. Superb.

The time-worn train comes to a rickety stop on its tarnished tracks, and somewhere a man yells, “Welcome to Lune Riviere, get your luggage and all, cause this train is leaving again in thirty minutes!”.
Such a brusque voice, Faye remarks as she removes her two bags from the rest of the baggage. Hauling her belongings along the inert horde on their way, the relief once she left the station was palpable. Alright, first things first. A quick rummaging spell yields a town map, and Faye studies it carefully before possibly making a fool of herself and her navigation skills.
602, silverleaf. She whispers the words while she walks, leaving no time for her mind to make a hoodwink of itself. The town had quite a bit of charm, Faye reflected while slowing her brisk walk to a more leisurely gait. Pictorial architecture, and summer foliage. Well-kept brick houses with a touch of Victorian design bordered cobblestone streets, like a time capsule lost from modern life. Puddles of clean water were strewn across the walkways, leaving a pleasant air of fresh earth after rain.

A good fifteen minute trek finds Faye at her destination: The lacklustre gates of the only guesthouses on silverleaf. At least there’s a view of the lake.

She makes her way to the reception, being met with someone swinging the door open before her. Giving her one quick passing look, the person soon trudges off.

“Sorry about that.” The receptionist sighs. “What can I help with?”

“I’m here to check in at the lakeview villa.” Faye said as she scoured her backpack for papers.

“Oh… the villa?”

“Yeah. Is something wrong?” Faye handed her the documents.

“Well”, She fidgeted, looking at the door. “Your travel guide just dropped off a notice that he quit.”

Faye’s brow knotted. “Do you know why he quit?”

“Something happened to his daughter and he’s moving back to his hometown now.” The receptionist waved dismissively, reassuring Faye “I’m sure you’ll find another easily.”.

“Hopefully.” She pondered absent-mindedly.

“Here are your keys.”

Faye snapped back from her contemplation, accepting the keys with a murmured “Thank you.”.

“Should I escort you?”

“I ought to find it myself.”, Faye smiled softly, retreating to the door. She looked at the cluster of antique keys in hand, number thirteen, she mused at the number of her dwelling’s key.

Upon first glance as one approached, the villa seemed a pleasant abode of modern and antiquated origin. It had the same ornate roof and décor as is signature of the Victorian era, but more rustic modern things found themselves amidst the elderly.

Faye unbolts the fine whittled pine door, and turns the handle to pick up her bags again. The wind swings the door open with an irksome creak, and she closes it behind her immediately once indoors. A strong exhale escapes her as she sets down her bags in the hallway, finally! The place is a haven of light and breeze, with the smell of freshly varnished wood wafting by from the deck. Faye ventures through the rooms, opening windows as she goes and admiring the construction, plummeting onto supple covers once she reaches her room. Surely Mae doesn’t know what she’s missing.

Again lost in reverie, Faye hunts for her phone. Where is it… She gets up and hauls her laptop bag along back to her room, so recovering her phone. No signal? She eyes the phone with a disheartened whine, slumping down and burying her face between the pillows. Maybe the phone picks up signal somewhere else in the house…

Faye pulls herself to stance again, and starts ambling about the confines of her interim habitat like one gone mad. Parading her phone about in a similar fashion to a 1940’s salute.

When her little signal expedition had no yield, she went to look instead for water. And find what she was looking for she did, but it solicited quite the scuffle to close what was found to be a faulty tap.

Damn it!

Getting the map to look for a nearby source of internet, Faye fixed her messy hair, giving her appearance a quick look of approval before making a B-line for the door with her laptop bag. There was no one to be found near the reception when Faye passed by, and looking at her watch she saw why. It was already twelve. With a sigh Faye walked on, she could always ask later.

The town was a little more busy this time of day, with tourists moseying about between the townspeople merrily on their way. What a nice change from the city! Faye thought to herself as she traversed. Looking ahead, she read the sign of her destination, ‘Quai café’. A rustic little gem situated right next to the docks.

Quite a quaint building, with its many windows and the deck that stretched out over the lake. Not surprising that it was busy, permanently. Faye regarded the busy establishment, taking a quick and awkward stride to a nearby corner table.

The hum of voices made it difficult to hear much, but it bothered little as she got her laptop to search for another travel guide. A waiter approaches, but Faye sends them away temporarily. If only there was some music to drown out the noise… A half hour’s search gets her nowhere, and she reaches for her phone with a sigh to update Mae.

“Hi.” An elderly lady approaches Faye, slightly awkward. “Would you mind for some company? All the seats are taken.”

“No, I wouldn’t mind at all.” Faye smiles, setting down her phone next to her.

“What’s your name, dear?”

“Faye. And you?”

“Nice to meet you, Faye. I’m Jane.” She smiled faintly. “You have a unique name, I must say.”

“Thanks, and it’s nice to meet you too.” Faye leans forward a bit, happy for some conversation. “What brings you to town?”

“Waiting for the scoundrel I call my brother…” Jane pouts. “And what brings you to town? Tourism?”

“Indeed.” Faye laughs. “Seems I have tourist written on my shirt somehow.”

“You’re new here, is all.” Jane smiles warmly. “How’s the town treated you so far?”

Faye tries to hide her pained expression, but sighs heavily. “It has been.. interesting. I think I may just have bad luck.”

“No such thing. Everything has a reason.” Jane is intrigued, “What all happened?”

“Well, for one, my travel guide quit. Moving to his hometown, and I can’t seem to find another.”

“Oh… he was your travel guide?” Jane looks away to the floor before looking back. “His daughter has been missing for almost two days now. And I wouldn’t wish to make any assumptions but-”

“Well hello. Getting recruits for a knitting club, hmm?” A sheriff approached, interrupting her.

“Yeah, sure, why not.” Jane gave him a chastising glare, before introducing him “Faye, this is Scott, my brother.”

“Nice to meet you sir.” Faye smiled, offering a handshake.

“Hello.” He accepted awkwardly.

“So, what have you done now?” Jane asks with an interrogating tone .

“Nothing…” He puts up his hands in a surrendering gesture. “Just thought I’d update you on the case.”

“Ah, you bring news?”

“Indeed. Bad news sadly.”

“What happened?”

“I found her.” Scott sighed. “But she’s dead.”

Faye picked up her phone, feeling like this is a conversation she wasn’t supposed to be a part of.

“Another one??” 

“You know how it goes. We knew she would die.”

“Cause of death?”

“Blood loss, mostly. Died of hypothermia later on.” Scott sighed. “And there are signs of torture.”

“Any leads?”

“Nope.” Scott’s phone rang. “Work. I got to go.” He waves quickly before leaving as he answered the phone.

“Such fine manners he has.” Jane says sarcastically. “Sorry about that.”

“It’s fine, don’t worry about it.” Faye smiled, again setting down her phone.

“So, as I said earlier, I wish to make no assumptions. But now we’ve heard from the Sheriff himself.” Jane sighed. “And she was such a nice person… Life can be so unfair sometimes.”

“You talk about this very casually.” Faye remarked. “Do you regularly hear of such cases if I may ask?”

“Sadly, yes. These killings have been happening since I grew up.”

“And no one knows who the murderers are? How?” Faye asked, exasperated. Was this perhaps just an old wives tale? Towns like these are known for their wild tales and folklore.

“Not a singular clue. And my brother has been working on this case all his career.” She sighs.

“Interesting… So you’ve lived here all your life?” Faye inquires.

“Indeed. I know all the forests, and I know the town as well as anyone.” Jane smiled.

“Well, I might need your help then.” Faye gets her map from her laptop bag. “Since you know the forests.”

“Gladly, what exactly do you want to know?”

“Mostly just hiking trails, and which ones are safe.”

“None.” Jane gave her a serious look. “It’s not safe from animals, and we don’t want another victim in the forest.”

“But I have no travel guide…” Faye looked hopeless. “If that’s the case my trip here is for nothing.”

“It really is difficult to find one this time of year too. There are so many tourists here looking for them.” Jane thought a bit. “Where all did you wish to go?”

“Well, just (forest name here) and (forest name here) and maybe a few others.” Faye counted the places mentally. “Maybe around 5 places?”

“Not a great much. Maybe I can find time to accompany you.” Jane offered. “These old bones of mine still have a few hikes in them somewhere.”

“That’s really kind of you…” Faye stammered. “If you’d be fine with it, then I’d be very grateful if you accompany me.”

“No problem dear, I’d happily tag along. When about were you planning your hikes?”

“Well, any time really. But chances are good they’d have to be all-day travels, since I’m a photographer.”

“You do photography? That’s nice.” Jane smiled, remarking, “You sure chose a good town for it.”.

Faye smiled. “Yep… It’s a very unique town. Very aesthetic, if you like Victorian architecture and forests that is.”

“Yeah… Old architecture. Like the people here.” Jane chuckled. “But I think I should be going, I have some chickens to tend to and they won’t be fond of me if I seem to forget them.”

“Rather not forget them.”

“Shall we meet here again tomorrow?” Jane suggested. “Then we can discuss your forest ventures.”

“Sure. What time?”

“Around ten?”

“Ten works. I’ll see you then.”

“Nice meeting you, Faye.”

“It was nice meeting you too.” Faye smiled, waving to Jane as she left.

Hey everyone. So I'm going to be in Chattanooga at the end of the month visiting some friends. We plan on just doing some light, low key and extremely chill (nerdy) activities in the area. Thinking. Board games and maybe a cat cafe. At least I am 😺

I'm flying in from LA. I've tried the standard sites looking for a companion but I am not having any luck. 

Ive been told that I'm a fairly easy on the eyes at times...epecially when the lights are off 😶

At any rate, I'm just looking for a SB friend for the day. Very low stress and not at all too demanding. Some light hiking, as I mentioned, maybe lunch and dinner...and coffee at the feline coffee shop if you wanted to join. Not at all a requirement.

If anyone's interested to find out more about this then just hit me up and I can share more details. It's just for 1 day as I mentioned. 

I'm guessing the weather will be fairly brisk at that time of year so be prepared to bring some warm weather clothing. 

I'm also active. Not married. No kids, I'm not hiding anything but acknowledge a need for boundaries. Dinners, brunches, outings and possible travel if interests align. 

Ideally looking for a foty, blonde 30-40 but not a deal breaker.

Ready to exchange pics/profile and M&G.

I suppose that's it. Let me know what, if anything, you think about this.

1g2a07q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2a07q,Update to the blue that we hated. Guess which color we picked!,"Thanks to all who left helpful comments on my previous post here a couple weeks ago. We sampled a lot of the suggestions that you guys made. Someone left a comment with a guide to “warm blue colors” or something like that - the color we ended up picking was from that guide so thank you to whoever shared that! I know many of you liked the first blue, but we knew off the bat that it wasn’t for us. We are so glad we stopped the painters as quickly as we did, and we are happy with the new blue. It’s still very BLUE but it’s much more muted than the first blue.  In the sun, it pulls very grey and in overcast weather, it pulls very blue. 

The beige trim is a bit more yellow than we expected (BW Shaker Beige) and we didn’t expect such a pull towards purple from the window/door color (BW Townsend Harbor Brown), but overall we think all three colors work well enough and are happy with the final result. Overall, we sampled 22 colors - some of which I didn’t post photos of here. 22 does not include the trim and window/door colors. 

If anyone can name all 13 of the colors (12 samples plus the first blue) in the photos, I’ll buy you a coffee! ",29,1728767555.0,ExteriorDesign,6,0.97,False

“No, fellow speaker of nonsensical words, I speak great truths.” He intones, blithely following my steps.

“Then the task be mine, if that would so appease you.” We walk further in silence, enjoying the rare sunlight as it radiates its glimmers through the trees. Vivid colours these, too bright actually. Yet still scenic. When we draw near, Kai finds himself a place to bask in the rays, while I am off to do more grim things.

“Try not to take your merry time.” I hear him faintly as I pick my way down precarious footholds. As if I have any intention of listening.
I am soon lost in the duskiness of ferns, moss, and other such foliage which flourishes in wan light. Oh, the earthy ambience… and coppery blood.
Here, in the ghoulish caverns so slightly buried in earth, I nimbly approach a cold figure. Broken cadaver, I think to myself as I observe its lifeless form. Soon to be nothing more than mere dirt under the feet of the living.

CHAPTER 1

Faye watched the forest keenly as it flitted past, imagining herself between the calm woodlands. She was lost in a sense of euphoria as the late morning sun wavered between the spruces and larch. Startled by a sudden movement as the old train stuttered over its tracks, she returned from her musing.

She was alone except for the woman next to her reading a book, and Faye found herself with only her thoughts for conversation. Unpleasant situation, to say the least.
She returns her scrutiny back to the window, and a sense of self-pity crawls over her like a multitude of insects. Why did Mae have to leave her to go on the trip alone?
A sulky sigh escapes her, of course something just had to come up at work. They’ve planned this trip for ages, and then Mae has to stay behind. Superb.

The time-worn train comes to a rickety stop on its tarnished tracks, and somewhere a man yells, “Welcome to Lune Riviere, get your luggage and all, cause this train is leaving again in thirty minutes!”.
Such a brusque voice, Faye remarks as she removes her two bags from the rest of the baggage. Hauling her belongings along the inert horde on their way, the relief once she left the station was palpable. Alright, first things first. A quick rummaging spell yields a town map, and Faye studies it carefully before possibly making a fool of herself and her navigation skills.
602, silverleaf. She whispers the words while she walks, leaving no time for her mind to make a hoodwink of itself. The town had quite a bit of charm, Faye reflected while slowing her brisk walk to a more leisurely gait. Pictorial architecture, and summer foliage. Well-kept brick houses with a touch of Victorian design bordered cobblestone streets, like a time capsule lost from modern life. Puddles of clean water were strewn across the walkways, leaving a pleasant air of fresh earth after rain.

A good fifteen minute trek finds Faye at her destination: The lacklustre gates of the only guesthouses on silverleaf. At least there’s a view of the lake.

She makes her way to the reception, being met with someone swinging the door open before her. Giving her one quick passing look, the person soon trudges off.

“Sorry about that.” The receptionist sighs. “What can I help with?”

“I’m here to check in at the lakeview villa.” Faye said as she scoured her backpack for papers.

“Oh… the villa?”

“Yeah. Is something wrong?” Faye handed her the documents.

“Well”, She fidgeted, looking at the door. “Your travel guide just dropped off a notice that he quit.”

Faye’s brow knotted. “Do you know why he quit?”

“Something happened to his daughter and he’s moving back to his hometown now.” The receptionist waved dismissively, reassuring Faye “I’m sure you’ll find another easily.”.

“Hopefully.” She pondered absent-mindedly.

“Here are your keys.”

Faye snapped back from her contemplation, accepting the keys with a murmured “Thank you.”.

“Should I escort you?”

“I ought to find it myself.”, Faye smiled softly, retreating to the door. She looked at the cluster of antique keys in hand, number thirteen, she mused at the number of her dwelling’s key.

Upon first glance as one approached, the villa seemed a pleasant abode of modern and antiquated origin. It had the same ornate roof and décor as is signature of the Victorian era, but more rustic modern things found themselves amidst the elderly.

Faye unbolts the fine whittled pine door, and turns the handle to pick up her bags again. The wind swings the door open with an irksome creak, and she closes it behind her immediately once indoors. A strong exhale escapes her as she sets down her bags in the hallway, finally! The place is a haven of light and breeze, with the smell of freshly varnished wood wafting by from the deck. Faye ventures through the rooms, opening windows as she goes and admiring the construction, plummeting onto supple covers once she reaches her room. Surely Mae doesn’t know what she’s missing.

Again lost in reverie, Faye hunts for her phone. Where is it… She gets up and hauls her laptop bag along back to her room, so recovering her phone. No signal? She eyes the phone with a disheartened whine, slumping down and burying her face between the pillows. Maybe the phone picks up signal somewhere else in the house…

Faye pulls herself to stance again, and starts ambling about the confines of her interim habitat like one gone mad. Parading her phone about in a similar fashion to a 1940’s salute.

When her little signal expedition had no yield, she went to look instead for water. And find what she was looking for she did, but it solicited quite the scuffle to close what was found to be a faulty tap.

Damn it!

Getting the map to look for a nearby source of internet, Faye fixed her messy hair, giving her appearance a quick look of approval before making a B-line for the door with her laptop bag. There was no one to be found near the reception when Faye passed by, and looking at her watch she saw why. It was already twelve. With a sigh Faye walked on, she could always ask later.

The town was a little more busy this time of day, with tourists moseying about between the townspeople merrily on their way. What a nice change from the city! Faye thought to herself as she traversed. Looking ahead, she read the sign of her destination, ‘Quai café’. A rustic little gem situated right next to the docks.

Quite a quaint building, with its many windows and the deck that stretched out over the lake. Not surprising that it was busy, permanently. Faye regarded the busy establishment, taking a quick and awkward stride to a nearby corner table.

The hum of voices made it difficult to hear much, but it bothered little as she got her laptop to search for another travel guide. A waiter approaches, but Faye sends them away temporarily. If only there was some music to drown out the noise… A half hour’s search gets her nowhere, and she reaches for her phone with a sigh to update Mae.

“Hi.” An elderly lady approaches Faye, slightly awkward. “Would you mind for some company? All the seats are taken.”

“No, I wouldn’t mind at all.” Faye smiles, setting down her phone next to her.

“What’s your name, dear?”

“Faye. And you?”

“Nice to meet you, Faye. I’m Jane.” She smiled faintly. “You have a unique name, I must say.”

“Thanks, and it’s nice to meet you too.” Faye leans forward a bit, happy for some conversation. “What brings you to town?”

“Waiting for the scoundrel I call my brother…” Jane pouts. “And what brings you to town? Tourism?”

“Indeed.” Faye laughs. “Seems I have tourist written on my shirt somehow.”

“You’re new here, is all.” Jane smiles warmly. “How’s the town treated you so far?”

Faye tries to hide her pained expression, but sighs heavily. “It has been.. interesting. I think I may just have bad luck.”

“No such thing. Everything has a reason.” Jane is intrigued, “What all happened?”

“Well, for one, my travel guide quit. Moving to his hometown, and I can’t seem to find another.”

“Oh… he was your travel guide?” Jane looks away to the floor before looking back. “His daughter has been missing for almost two days now. And I wouldn’t wish to make any assumptions but-”

“Well hello. Getting recruits for a knitting club, hmm?” A sheriff approached, interrupting her.

“Yeah, sure, why not.” Jane gave him a chastising glare, before introducing him “Faye, this is Scott, my brother.”

“Nice to meet you sir.” Faye smiled, offering a handshake.

“Hello.” He accepted awkwardly.

“So, what have you done now?” Jane asks with an interrogating tone .

“Nothing…” He puts up his hands in a surrendering gesture. “Just thought I’d update you on the case.”

“Ah, you bring news?”

“Indeed. Bad news sadly.”

“What happened?”

“I found her.” Scott sighed. “But she’s dead.”

Faye picked up her phone, feeling like this is a conversation she wasn’t supposed to be a part of.

“Another one??” 

“You know how it goes. We knew she would die.”

“Cause of death?”

“Blood loss, mostly. Died of hypothermia later on.” Scott sighed. “And there are signs of torture.”

“Any leads?”

“Nope.” Scott’s phone rang. “Work. I got to go.” He waves quickly before leaving as he answered the phone.

“Such fine manners he has.” Jane says sarcastically. “Sorry about that.”

“It’s fine, don’t worry about it.” Faye smiled, again setting down her phone.

“So, as I said earlier, I wish to make no assumptions. But now we’ve heard from the Sheriff himself.” Jane sighed. “And she was such a nice person… Life can be so unfair sometimes.”

“You talk about this very casually.” Faye remarked. “Do you regularly hear of such cases if I may ask?”

“Sadly, yes. These killings have been happening since I grew up.”

“And no one knows who the murderers are? How?” Faye asked, exasperated. Was this perhaps just an old wives tale? Towns like these are known for their wild tales and folklore.

“Not a singular clue. And my brother has been working on this case all his career.” She sighs.

“Interesting… So you’ve lived here all your life?” Faye inquires.

“Indeed. I know all the forests, and I know the town as well as anyone.” Jane smiled.

“Well, I might need your help then.” Faye gets her map from her laptop bag. “Since you know the forests.”

“Gladly, what exactly do you want to know?”

“Mostly just hiking trails, and which ones are safe.”

“None.” Jane gave her a serious look. “It’s not safe from animals, and we don’t want another victim in the forest.”

“But I have no travel guide…” Faye looked hopeless. “If that’s the case my trip here is for nothing.”

“It really is difficult to find one this time of year too. There are so many tourists here looking for them.” Jane thought a bit. “Where all did you wish to go?”

“Well, just (forest name here) and (forest name here) and maybe a few others.” Faye counted the places mentally. “Maybe around 5 places?”

“Not a great much. Maybe I can find time to accompany you.” Jane offered. “These old bones of mine still have a few hikes in them somewhere.”

“That’s really kind of you…” Faye stammered. “If you’d be fine with it, then I’d be very grateful if you accompany me.”

“No problem dear, I’d happily tag along. When about were you planning your hikes?”

“Well, any time really. But chances are good they’d have to be all-day travels, since I’m a photographer.”

“You do photography? That’s nice.” Jane smiled, remarking, “You sure chose a good town for it.”.

Faye smiled. “Yep… It’s a very unique town. Very aesthetic, if you like Victorian architecture and forests that is.”

“Yeah… Old architecture. Like the people here.” Jane chuckled. “But I think I should be going, I have some chickens to tend to and they won’t be fond of me if I seem to forget them.”

“Rather not forget them.”

“Shall we meet here again tomorrow?” Jane suggested. “Then we can discuss your forest ventures.”

“Sure. What time?”

“Around ten?”

“Ten works. I’ll see you then.”

“Nice meeting you, Faye.”

“It was nice meeting you too.” Faye smiled, waving to Jane as she left.

1g29qt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1g29qt6/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Join this group if you want to sell works. Post your works. You web links. I'm sure I will.

You can announce meetings in your area. You might have meeting rooms, a café, restaurant, etc. where people can meet. In the future, you can have the regular show and tell, where books can be shown and shared.

I’m located in Tampa and we recently took a decent hit from Milton leaving over 600k customers out of power for 3 days and counting! Meanwhile, had my lightening powering my fridge, deep freezer, multiple fans, phone charges, and even at some points our deep fryer, microwave, air fryer, coffee machine, TV, lights and much more smaller things! Going from 100% (278 miles for me) riding me to 78%!!!!! From around 12:15 AM Thursday till Saturday around 3:15 PM. 63 hours of power and only using 22%.

1g29psv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g29psv,getting used to high altitude! ,"I’ve been making sourdough for about a month now at high altitude and finally got a result I’m proud of!! I’ve really struggled finding the right hydration, bulk ferment time, and baking temperatures for 6,000 feet, and i still have a long way to go, but i’m counting this one as a victory! That said, does anyone have any altitude hacks or adjustments? How can i improve here? 

my process this time (for two loaves, the second one just had uglier scoring lol) was this: 
- 850 ish g King Arthur bread flour 
- 150 g all purpose flour 
- 700 g warm water 
- 200 g starter 
- 21 g salt 

I combined the flour, water, and starter and let sit for an hour before adding salt and doing the first round of stretch and folds. I did two more rounds of stretching and folding 30 minutes apart then let bulk ferment for another four ish hours before dividing the dough, shaping, and putting in the fridge overnight. This morning, i preheated my dutch oven at 500 for an hour, then baked the loaves at 460 with the lid on for 35 minutes and lid off for another 25 (my oven is a horrible college apartment oven for context).

1g29ofe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDmeds/comments/1g29ofe/is_it_all_in_my_head/,Is it all in my head?,"22F, Ive been prescribed ritalin (10mg x3 a day) for around probably 3 years now. I’ll often also get a script from my gp to get another refill for the month when I run out. However, I’ve only been doing that for this past year. 

My tolerance has been going up significantly and the meds wouldn’t do anything with my normal dosage (I’m aware that’s not necessarily ideal).

The medication obviously has clear side effects, so I know when it kicks in, but for it to work - you sorta already have to have some motivation. The meds are supposed to give you that extra push *to my understanding that’s what makes methylphenidate different to amphetamines.

Anyway, I find myself not even thinking about talking on a task, unless I have the medication on hand. But when I have it, even though it takes 30-45min to kick in, the second I take it - I’m ready to work.

I’ve tried to recreate this “routine” with coffee, but it’s just not the same. I feel like I’m tricking myself that I’ll be motivated, and then I am. And the only thing that triggers that ripple effect, is taking the medication. It’s part of the routine to then not feel hungry and have dry mouth, so immediately I think “damn I need to be productive now because this medication is expensive”.

Please be kind, would just appreciate some feedback on this situation.",2,1728766629.0,ADHDmeds,0,1.0,False

I also picked up some medium roasted beans, excited to brew a great cup of coffee. Unfortunately, the result was underwhelming - both weak and lacking in flavor.

I would really appreciate any advice or suggestions you might have to improve my brew. Here is the process I followed:

1) I ground 30 grams of beans (for four cups) using the Wilfa Svart.

2) Pre-heated the brewer by running a small amount of water through it.

3) Added 500ml of water and placed the ground coffee in the filter.

4) Set the filter basket to the closed position and started the brewing process.

5) Stirred the coffee grounds once the basket was about halfway filled with water.

6) Opened the filter basket to the medium setting for the remainder of the brew.

I feel weak all the time. I feel tired all the time. I eat absolute crap. I barely eat enough, let alone eating healthy/proper. I know I need to get better sleep habits. I know I need to exercise more and I know I need to eat better. I got blood work done and everything came back normal but I don’t know how. 

How do I have a normal amount of protein? Where am I getting that from? The one thing I eat a day at 8pm that’s processed something? I’m not lacking vitamin D, how am I not? I game on my computer alot and only go outside twice a week to go to work (and then work inside all day). Calcium? Got enough of that. Ferritin(iron) perfectly fine. Potassium is great. CBC and differential perfect. Etc. etc. NOTHING abnormal. 

I wanted to get blood work done because I know I have a very poor unhealthy lifestyle in every way, so I wanted to see what I was lacking, hoping to take vitamins for in the mean time until I can pick my shit up and figure out why being healthy is so hard for me. Does anyone else struggle with this? Has anyone struggled with this and got out of it and changed yourself around? 

I don’t want to feel weak and tired all the time wether I sleep 6-8 hours or 9-12. Still have dark circles under my eyes. Head- pounding. Body- hurts. Appetite- gone. Insides- shakey. And ALL I drink is water! (One coffee in the morning that I never finish, juice or pop maybe once a month, have ONE drink on a weekend that I also never usually finish also it’s not every weekend) I hate feeling like this and I know being hydrated staying active and eating right will pretty much cure it all because that’s what everyone is saying but… How? I’m thinking about smoothies and just putting a bunch of healthy stuff in it so I can get good amounts of vitamin d, protein, omega 3, this, that and the other thing! But I’m technically not even lacking in any of them?? So idk what realistically I should put in my smoothies to start becoming more healthy. No I cannot just buy fruits and vegetables and count on myself to eat them everyday for 5-7 days straight before they go bad! I live in a very small place, small kitchen, limited cooking (small toaster oven on counter) no dishwasher and arthritis in my hands + wrists so washing dishes is a nightmare, I’m horrible at cooking, even tho I like to cook. Get overstimulated while cooking, mess, mess after cooking, things getting burnt or boiling over, one thing being hot and ready to eat but having to wait 25-40 minutes for this other thing that I didn’t start in time and vice versa.

I feel so embarrassed being 25 and having this much trouble to be a normal healthy adult. I know what needs to be done but I need someone to like, tell me exactly what to do?? Almost be held accountable for it, give me homework, figure out why it is/was so hard for me to do _______. 
(Need to add I do struggle with mental health also, have been going through mental health and med changes this whole year and especially past few months.)
I liked to go on walks but I need to fix my walking style because I can’t walk for longer than 5 mins because my shins are in absolute agony?? so that’s uncomfortable af. I barely eat so if I go for a walk I come back shakey and weak, feel a lil sick even. Etc.

I just truly don’t even know where to start. My shins hurt so bad, I don’t wanna go on a walk even tho i like walks. I do at home bodyweight workouts and feel faint everytime I get up and down from something (burpees or similar). I have asthma. I’m really not hungry please don’t make me eat when I’m not hungry. My fingers are so cold and my hands shake a bunch. My blood feels like it’s shaking sometimes it’s such a weird feeling to explain. I have nothing in my stomach except water and it’s uncomfortable. It’s only 3pm and I’m this tired? My back hurts. I desperately need to fix my posture. Carrying this jug of milk is difficult. I just washed dishes and now my hands feel cramped up and now they’re gonna be sore for days. I feel like I look pale all the time. People probably think I’m sick, or maybe I don’t look sick and my minds playing tricks on me. Idk. 

Why is this so hard for me? Am I really being dramatic and just so fcking lazy?? If I wake up at 8 am, drink a healthy smoothie and go for a good long walk and drink water for the rest of the day and cook myself healthy meals with proper nutrition, will this truly all go away? If I do all of that, everyday? No more dark eye circles? No more achey body? No more cold shakey hands? No more pain in my shins? Feel and look ALIVE???? Please be kind and give suggestions or advice without also making me feel like a failure for “being this dramatic” or “making up all these excuses” I know what needs to be done, but why do I feel like I can’t do it?

After visiting *Italy*, he was inspired by the vibrant coffee culture in *Italian* cafés, where coffeehouses were places for socialising and relaxation. *Howard* wanted to bring that experience to *America*, transforming *Starbucks* into a place where customers could enjoy premium coffee and socialise. However, the *Starbucks* founders weren’t convinced.

In *1985*, *Howard* left to start his own coffee company, *Il Giornale*, to test and prove his idea. It was, indeed, a success. Two years later, *Howard* bought *Starbucks* and merged it with *Il Giornale,* shifting the business focus to creating a café experience. *Howard*’s marketing genius is a key reason for *Starbucks*’ remarkable growth and success. An integral part of this was high profit margins and long term customer loyalty.

# LTV to CAC Ratio

>The key to multiplying wealth is simple: identify and improve the ratios of inputs to outputs that matter most in your business. - *Charlie Munger*

While there are many factors that determine the growth prospects of a business, one financial metric is key. It is the *Lifetime Value* (*LTV*) to *Customer Acquisition Cost* (*CAC*) ratio. This encapsulates the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring that customer. This ratio informs many aspects of business growth potential, including how far to scale advertising, customer acquisition and profitability.

The *LTV* to *CAC* ratio is calculated by dividing the *LTV* by *CAC*.

The components are:

* ***Lifetime Value (LTV)***: Average *Gross Margin* (or *Gross Profit*) per customer over their lifetime with the brand. This is revenue less the cost of delivering the product (or *Cost of Goods Sold*).
* ***Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)***: Cost incurred to acquire a new customer, including spending on marketing, advertising and sales.

# Growth potential

>If your LTV to CAC ratio is 3:1 or better, you have a scalable business. If it's less, you need to either improve retention or reduce acquisition costs. - *Alex Hormozi*

Growth potential is maximised when the *LTV to CAC Ratio* is large. If the ratio is 10 then for every pound spent on customer acquisition, 10 pounds is returned. By contrast, a ratio of 1 is poor and represents a break even situation. Ratios below 1 mean every new customer is loss making.

A business that has multiple product lines should focus efforts on those where the *LTV to CAC Ratio* is highest.

*Starbucks* has grown to 38,000 locations, mainly corporate owned, with minimal franchising. On average, each customer generates over £11,000 in revenue with products like £5 *Frappuccinos*. They retain customers for many years. With low production costs, their profit margins are substantial, and the cost of acquiring a customer is minimal. This results in an *LTV to CAC Ratio* likely exceeding 1000, a key driver of their significant growth.

# Optimising LTV to CAC Ratio

>Chasing a better LTV to CAC ratio means making hard decisions, like improving your product, reworking your pricing strategy or cutting unprofitable acquisition channels. - *Alex Hormozi*

At the top level, the *LTV to CAC Ratio* can be improved by maximising *LTV* and/or minimising *CAC*. *LTV* can be maximised by decreasing churn, increasing price, selling more units per customer, cross selling additional things, upselling a better version of the product or decreasing delivery costs. *CAC* can be minimised by improving operational efficiency in marketing and sales.

I’m utterly confused at this sight, and the more I looked at it the more I felt like it was looking back. Eventually, for some reason, I was just like “oh okay” and went back to watching the movie.

 I’m missing a gap in the middle of the dream, but the next part I can properly recall is sitting on my bed alone one night, when I look up for no real reason. When I do, instead of the ceiling, I see like a giant red sky with black cloud looking things. There’s a giant black version of the silhouette from before towering over me. There’s this loud yet muffled screaming sound coming from the red void.

 The scene ends when there’s like a jump cut to me talking with my dad. We’re at a coffee shop or something I suppose. I tell him “I’ve been seeing them more recently.” He has a stoic expression as he replies in a hushed tone. 

“Well, that’s what happens to a prodigal son.”

 This makes sense to me in the dream, and I get sad. I get overwhelmed with a sense of overwhelming dread, and it’s so overwhelming I kind of, force myself awake.


 Super random, my best guess is that it has something to do with the overbearing religious attitude my parents had always taken towards me. I feel like growing up is breaking free of this, but no matter what I always feel a twinge of guilt for living my life how I want, as their control has imbedded itself in my psyche. As such, perhaps this has something to do with that. I don’t know.",1,1728764955.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

However, the *Starbucks* founders weren’t convinced.

# LTV to CAC Ratio

>The key to multiplying wealth is simple: identify and improve the ratios of inputs to outputs that matter most in your business. - *Charlie Munger*

While there are many factors that determine the growth prospects of a business, one financial metric is key. It is the *Lifetime Value* (*LTV*) to *Customer Acquisition Cost* (*CAC*) ratio. This encapsulates the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring that customer. This ratio informs many aspects of business growth potential, including how far to scale advertising, customer acquisition and profitability.

The *LTV* to *CAC* ratio is calculated by dividing the *LTV* by *CAC*.

The components are:

* ***Lifetime Value (LTV)***: Average *Gross Margin* (or *Gross Profit*) per customer over their lifetime with the brand. This is revenue less the cost of delivering the product (or *Cost of Goods Sold*).
* ***Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)***: Cost incurred to acquire a new customer, including spending on marketing, advertising and sales.

# Growth potential

>If your LTV to CAC ratio is 3:1 or better, you have a scalable business. If it's less, you need to either improve retention or reduce acquisition costs. - *Alex Hormozi*

Growth potential is maximised when the *LTV to CAC Ratio* is large. If the ratio is 10 then for every pound spent on customer acquisition, 10 pounds is returned. By contrast, a ratio of 1 is poor and represents a break even situation. Ratios below 1 mean every new customer is loss making.

A business that has multiple product lines should focus efforts on those where the *LTV to CAC Ratio* is highest.

*Starbucks* has grown to 38,000 locations, mainly corporate owned, with minimal franchising. On average, each customer generates over £11,000 in revenue with products like £5 *Frappuccinos*. They retain customers for many years. With low production costs, their profit margins are substantial, and the cost of acquiring a customer is minimal. This results in an *LTV to CAC Ratio* likely exceeding 1000, a key driver of their significant growth.

# Optimising LTV to CAC Ratio

>Chasing a better LTV to CAC ratio means making hard decisions, like improving your product, reworking your pricing strategy or cutting unprofitable acquisition channels. - *Alex Hormozi*

At the top level, the *LTV to CAC Ratio* can be improved by maximising *LTV* and/or minimising *CAC*. *LTV* can be maximised by decreasing churn, increasing price, selling more units per customer, cross selling additional things, upselling a better version of the product or decreasing delivery costs. *CAC* can be minimised by improving operational efficiency in marketing and sales.

I met this guy on Tinder 4 years ago - he used to be super shy and introverted with me when we started talking, I even had to convince him to open up to me more, because often times he wouldnt respond to my messages out of fear of not knowing to say. He asked me out for a coffee 4 years back (two months after we started talking), ofc I agreed but he said it'd the best after covid ends. So then covid ended, we still were in contact, I even reached out to him about the meeting that i'd be cool if we'd have met during summer (that was 2 years back) but it still didnt happen. He said he never reached the border etc.(He lives 60 km from my town in a different country) So i told him to ask me again when he's ready and he agreed, but still... Nothing. He said he'd like to meet eventually if we dont get nuked. I even dated someone else in the meantime because this guy is so slow.. I didnt want to force him so I never asked again.
During these 4 years we bonded a lot, I could even call him my best friend at this point. We know each other so well and I'm pretty sure he had a crush on me when we started talking, he even said he really likes me just because I really listen to what he has to say and he's never met someone like me before. These days I don't know how he feels because he's really open with me :D And i'd say the same about him - I truly care about him. I dont know if It's love but I really wanna be here for him.
 
It's just a shame that he doesn't feel like meeting, he told me once that having a relationship with someone wouldnt be good for him atm but maybe in the future.. And I'm just wondering if his interest wasnt even that big to start of with. That i wasnt good enough to meet up with? I sometimes have these scenarios in my head what Would have happened, what is he like irl? Ive never heard his voice either, I asked him once to send a voice message because I was really curious what he sounds like, but that didn't work out either.

I guess i'm just curious if you can just like someone and not be willing to meet up and really make it happen, because I'd have done it years ago.. i'm sometimes wondering, maybe I just like the idea of him and the way he messages me but I dont really know him completely and I can't know hin completely because he doesn't let me to and that just makes me really sad.
I'm not sure If I should just step back and not be as responsive? Maybe he just likes the attention i'm giving him, so that he's not as lonely.",1,1728764611.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

Using plain printer paper, I used the crazed ""All work and no play"" idea from the Kubrick film. To age them, I crumpled up the pages, soaked them in coffee and dried them in my oven. I splattered on watercolor blood with a toothbrush. For the inside lapels, I found a crazy photo of King from his college newspaper and copied the original layout, but again used the ""All work"" idea in place of the copy. I covered it with Brodart Just-a-Fold archival plastic. Fun.

1g28wvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnMap/comments/1g28wvw/leveraging_growth_via_a_key_input_to_output/,Leveraging growth via a key input to output financial ratio,"*Howard Schultz* joined *Starbucks* in 1982 as the director of retail operations and marketing, but he saw a bigger opportunity than just selling coffee beans. After visiting *Italy*, he was inspired by the vibrant coffee culture in *Italian* cafés, where coffeehouses were places for socialising and relaxation. *Howard* wanted to bring that experience to *America*, transforming *Starbucks* into a place where customers could enjoy premium coffee and socialise. However, the *Starbucks* founders weren’t convinced.

In *1985*, *Howard* left to start his own coffee company, *Il Giornale*, to test and prove his idea. It was, indeed, a success. Two years later, *Howard* bought *Starbucks* and merged it with *Il Giornale,* shifting the business focus to creating a café experience. *Howard*’s marketing genius is a key reason for *Starbucks*’ remarkable growth and success. An integral part of this was high profit margins and long term customer loyalty.

# LTV to CAC Ratio

The key to multiplying wealth is simple: identify and improve the ratios of inputs to outputs that matter most in your business. - *Charlie Munger*

While there are many factors that determine the growth prospects of a business, one financial metric is key. It is the *Lifetime Value* (*LTV*) to *Customer Acquisition Cost* (*CAC*) ratio. This encapsulates the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring that customer. This ratio informs many aspects of business growth potential, including how far to scale advertising, customer acquisition and profitability.

The *LTV* to *CAC* ratio is calculated by dividing the *LTV* by *CAC*.

The components are:

* ***Lifetime Value (LTV)***: Average *Gross Margin* (or *Gross Profit*) per customer over their lifetime with the brand. This is revenue less the cost of delivering the product (or *Cost of Goods Sold*).
* ***Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)***: Cost incurred to acquire a new customer, including spending on marketing, advertising and sales.

# Growth potential

If your LTV to CAC ratio is 3:1 or better, you have a scalable business. If it's less, you need to either improve retention or reduce acquisition costs. - *Alex Hormozi*

Growth potential is maximised when the *LTV to CAC Ratio* is large. If the ratio is 10 then for every pound spent on customer acquisition, 10 pounds is returned. By contrast, a ratio of 1 is poor and represents a break even situation. Ratios below 1 mean every new customer is loss making.

A business that has multiple product lines should focus efforts on those where the *LTV to CAC Ratio* is highest.

*Starbucks* has grown to 38,000 locations, mainly corporate owned, with minimal franchising. On average, each customer generates over £11,000 in revenue with products like £5 *Frappuccinos*. They retain customers for many years. With low production costs, their profit margins are substantial, and the cost of acquiring a customer is minimal. This results in an *LTV to CAC Ratio* likely exceeding 1000, a key driver of their significant growth.

# Optimising LTV to CAC Ratio

Chasing a better LTV to CAC ratio means making hard decisions, like improving your product, reworking your pricing strategy or cutting unprofitable acquisition channels. - *Alex Hormozi*

At the top level, the *LTV to CAC Ratio* can be improved by maximising *LTV* and/or minimising *CAC*. *LTV* can be maximised by decreasing churn, increasing price, selling more units per customer, cross selling additional things, upselling a better version of the product or decreasing delivery costs. *CAC* can be minimised by improving operational efficiency in marketing and sales.

I met this guy on Tinder 4 years ago - he used to be super shy and introverted with me when we started talking, I even had to convince him to open up to me more, because often times he wouldnt respond to my messages out of fear of not knowing to say. He asked me out for a coffee 4 years back (two months after we started talking), ofc I agreed but he said it'd the best after covid ends. So then covid ended, we still were in contact, became friends, I even reached out to him about the meeting that i'd be cool if we'd have met during summer (that was 2 years back) but it still didnt happen. He said he never reached the border etc.(He lives 60 km from my town in a different country) So i told him to ask me again when he's ready and he agreed, but still... Nothing. He said he'd like to meet eventually if we dont get nuked. I even dated someone else in the meantime because this guy is so slow.. I didnt want to force him so I never asked again.
During these 4 years we bonded a lot, I could even call him my best friend at this point. We know each other so well and I'm pretty sure he had a crush on me when we started talking, he even said he really likes me just because I really listen to what he has to say and he's never met someone like me before. These days I don't know how he feels because he's really open with me :D And i'd say the same about him - I truly care about him. I dont know if It's love but I really wanna be here for him.
 
It's just a shame that he doesn't feel like meeting, he told me once that having a relationship with someone wouldnt be good for him atm but maybe in the future.. And I'm just wondering if his interest wasnt even that big to start of with. That i wasnt good enough to meet up with? I sometimes have these scenarios in my head what Would have happened, what is he like irl? Ive never heard his voice either, I asked him once to send a voice message because I was really curious what he sounds like, but that didn't work out either.

I guess i'm just curious if you can just like someone and not be willing to meet up and really make it happen, because I'd have done it years ago.. i'm sometimes wondering, maybe I just like the idea of him and the way he messages me but I dont really know him completely and I can't know hin completely because he doesn't let me to and that just makes me really sad.
I'm not sure If I should just step back and not be as responsive? Maybe he just likes the attention i'm giving him, so that he's not as lonely.",2,1728764055.0,relationship_advice,6,0.75,False
1g28rj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PopularSupplements/comments/1g28rj0/how_fitspresso_transformed_my_energy_focus_and/,"How Fitspresso Transformed My Energy, Focus, and Fitness Journey: A Coffee Lover’s Story","It was a brisk fall morning in the heart of New York City when John first stumbled upon Fitspresso, a new health-focused coffee blend. He wasn’t just an average coffee drinker; like many Americans, he relied on his morning brew to kickstart his day. But lately, the jitters and the midday energy crashes had been making him reconsider his coffee habit. John’s story isn’t unique—it’s a familiar tale of busy professionals, fitness enthusiasts, and health-conscious individuals seeking better alternatives.

John had always been active, balancing his corporate job with frequent trips to the gym. He enjoyed his routine, but as he got older, he noticed that his metabolism was slowing down, his energy levels fluctuated more, and the coffee that once gave him the boost he needed was no longer cutting it. That’s when a friend introduced him to Fitspresso—a coffee blend designed not only to provide a rich and flavorful experience but also to offer health benefits like boosting metabolism, promoting weight loss, and providing sustained energy throughout the day.

Intrigued, John did his research. He read about Fitspresso's unique combination of ingredients, which set it apart from traditional coffee. Premium coffee beans were paired with metabolism-boosting green tea extract, Garcinia Cambogia for appetite suppression, and a blend of B vitamins, chromium, and coconut oil to sustain energy levels without the crash. What really caught John's attention, though, was the promise of improved mental clarity and reduced anxiety, thanks to the addition of L-Theanine, a natural compound known for its calming effects.

Feeling optimistic, John decided to give it a try. On the first morning, he followed the simple steps to brew his Fitspresso—one scoop into his coffee maker, add hot water, and stir. The aroma was familiar, but the taste was richer, smoother, and felt more indulgent than his usual brew. He drank it black, as recommended, though he knew he could easily add milk or sweeteners to suit his taste.

The effects were immediate. Unlike his regular coffee, which gave him a quick energy spike followed by a crash, Fitspresso provided him with sustained energy that lasted well into the afternoon. At work, John noticed a sharper focus, allowing him to power through meetings without the usual brain fog that crept in after lunch. He felt more productive, and there was a notable improvement in his mood. The stress of the day seemed more manageable, and the anxiety that often came with deadlines had significantly diminished.

[Fitspresso](https://preview.redd.it/5lhiopvoo9ud1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0f96b2e082ec651c409c87d5a00ca2ea6eaad2)

Within a few weeks, the changes became even more apparent. John’s gym sessions were more productive, and he felt stronger and more energized during workouts. Thanks to the appetite-suppressing effects of Garcinia Cambogia, he was able to curb his afternoon snack cravings, which had previously sabotaged his weight loss efforts. Slowly but surely, he began shedding those stubborn extra pounds that had been clinging on for years.

John wasn’t alone in his experience. Sarah, a stay-at-home mom in California, had similar results. Struggling to juggle her daily responsibilities while maintaining her fitness goals, she discovered Fitspresso through an online fitness group. Sarah was drawn to the antioxidant-rich formula that promised not just weight loss but overall health improvement. After incorporating Fitspresso into her daily routine, Sarah noticed she had more energy to keep up with her two young kids, and her mood improved dramatically. She no longer felt overwhelmed by the day-to-day stresses and appreciated the clarity and calm that Fitspresso brought to her mornings.

For Michael, a fitness enthusiast and entrepreneur based in Texas, Fitspresso became an integral part of his pre-workout routine. He praised the energy boost it provided without the crash he’d experienced with other pre-workout supplements. Fitspresso helped him stay focused and motivated, allowing him to push through intense workouts while also supporting his weight management goals.

What made Fitspresso a game changer for all these individuals was not just the immediate benefits but the fact that it was easy to integrate into their lifestyles. Unlike some health supplements that required strict dietary changes or time-consuming routines, Fitspresso fit seamlessly into their daily coffee ritual. Whether it was John brewing it at home before work, Sarah sipping it in the quiet moments before her kids woke up, or Michael enjoying it as a pre-workout boost, Fitspresso was there, supporting their goals without requiring drastic changes.

The science behind Fitspresso further fueled their confidence in the product. The blend of ingredients, including ginseng for energy and brain health, chromium for balanced blood sugar levels, and coconut oil for healthy fats, had been carefully researched and formulated. John was particularly impressed by the inclusion of B vitamins, which played a crucial role in converting food into energy—a key factor in maintaining his active lifestyle.

By the end of the first month, John had lost several pounds, his energy levels were consistently high, and he felt more in control of his health. But beyond the physical benefits, it was the mental clarity and reduced anxiety that truly made Fitspresso a staple in his life. For someone who had been searching for a better alternative to his regular coffee, Fitspresso proved to be more than just a beverage—it became a tool for transforming his daily routine into one that supported both his physical and mental well-being.

In a world where so many people are looking for simple, effective ways to improve their health, Fitspresso stands out as a product that delivers on its promises. It’s not just about weight loss or energy—it’s about creating a lifestyle that helps people like John, Sarah, and Michael feel their best every day.

If you're someone who enjoys coffee but is also looking to enhance your health, energy, and overall well-being, Fitspresso might just be the perfect addition to your routine. The stories of people like John, Sarah, and Michael show that sometimes, a small change—like swapping out your regular coffee for a health-boosting blend—can make a big difference.

**Give Fitspresso a try, and see if it can help you, too, feel more energized, focused, and ready to take on the day. Whether you’re managing a busy work schedule, chasing after kids, or pushing yourself at the gym, Fitspresso is there to support you every step of the way:** [**https://fitspresso.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/fitspresso.html)",1,1728763992.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

We purchased a Chicco Bravo system but I wasn’t aware of the guidelines for car seat time. Chicco does not have a bassinet attachment. 

I’m so frustrated because my husband seems to think it’s just a guideline - we can keep our LO in it longer than 30 minutes.

Now he wants to take her for a walk in the car seat clicked into the stroller with his dad, which is NEVER a short walk. 

I pulled up an article about container baby syndrome and he seems to think I’m being overkill. We did ask our pediatrician about guidelines with car seat time and she didn’t seem as strict about it as others seem to be. 

Our LO is one month old. I don’t know that I’m looking for any answers, just VERY frustrated with the car seat situation and my husband’s disagreement with the guidelines/my feelings on it.
