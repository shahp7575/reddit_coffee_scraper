Who Goes There? Chapter One

It was a drowsy night in the windy city with little murmurs along the streets. I was going to one of my favorite diners, The Two Tails. I always wondered how it got that name if it was just a creative choice or if there was an actual reason they did it. I walked in through the door and Mary greeted me with her usual smile. ‚ÄúGood evening Detective, slow day I take it?‚Äù She looked at me with her ever watching eyes. I just kinda chuckled at her, ‚ÄúYes it was quite slow today at the office but I see that as a good thing, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù I said in a chipper tone. She simply replied with a nod and asked me ‚ÄúSo detective, will it be your usual or you gonna try something different for once?‚Äù She grinned knowing I‚Äôll get the same thing I always do. I laughed at her and said, ‚Äúyou know me far too well. I‚Äôm getting too predictable, guess I‚Äôll have to change it up next time‚Äù She looked at me disapprovingly and crossed her arms. ‚ÄúDetective, you've said that same thing the last five times you‚Äôve been here‚Ä¶ anyway.‚Äù She pulled out her notepad and josseld down my order. ‚ÄúSo black coffee and a chop medium rare, right detective?‚Äù I chuckled a little  ‚Äúyou got it Mary‚Äù and with that she walked back to the kitchen and I sat in a booth waiting for my meal. After a few minutes, Mary came to my booth with a mug and a pot of coffee. She set the mug down and poured some coffee in it. As she poured the cup I asked for the newspaper so I could see if anything was going on. She walked over to the counter near the register and grabbed a newspaper and dropped it off at my table before walking back to the kitchen. I looked through the newspaper as always and the headline seems to be that mutant stream in humans is increasing. These days there are probably around fourteen thousand of us. I myself am one of these mutants as you could say. My mutation allows me to change my very DNA so I can shift into a different person a copy of one as well as seeing slightly into a person's mind if I touch them or something they had recently touched. It's what makes me an amazing detective. Few minutes later, Mary came out carrying my plate with a nice pork chop and baked potato on the side. I looked at it ready for my supper as I hadn‚Äôt eaten most of the day besides a few little snacks but besides that nothing much. As she put my plate down I grabbed a fork and knife from my trench coat and started cutting into my dinner as I was eating. Someone walked into the diner and sat at my table. It was a girl who looked quite a bit younger than me. She was wearing a scarlet coat. I looked at her cautiously, her face was slightly hidden by her hood and her hair blocked the rest. I could really only see one eye looking at me, no doubt her other eye was as well. After watching her for a minute I held out my hand to introduce myself, ‚ÄúHello miss, I think you may have the wrong person. You see my name is Who, John Who to be specific and I‚Äôm not certain I know you, think you could help me out here?‚Äù She slowly reached her hand out and said her name was Anna. As I shook her hand I caught a small glimpse of her mind. This woman, she had witnessed something horrific but I couldn‚Äôt tell what exactly she had seen.

1h7cnzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keurig/comments/1h7cnzz/iso_reusable_kcup_for_shot_mode/,ISO: Reusable KCup for Shot Mode,"
Backstory: I have KCafe and use the shot mode daily with kcups I usually make cafe lattes with oat milk (sometimes with Lactaid Milk). This allows me to enjoy the coffee flavor while minimizing heartburn/reflux. I find for lattes single shot 4oz of milk (cappuccino line on frother) double shot 7oz of milk (smidge above latte line). Anymore milk just dilutes the flavor. I have whole bean coffee from local roasters that I have visited on my recent travels and would like to try them via shot mode. (I have a French press and aero press.)


I am aware this isn‚Äôt an espresso machine but I hope to get to acceptable  substitute using finely ground coffee beans.

So what I am looking for is reusable kcup:
- good at  filtering out the grit ( willing to use paper filters to achieve this
- handle shot mode
- can hold 11g coffee with ease perhaps even more 

EZ cup from perfect pod seems most promising but not sure

1h7cnvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1h7cnvl/what_do_i_do_my_mum_and_grandma_have_issues/,What do I do? My mum and grandma have issues.,"I am not really sure how to even start this. Maybe with this: English is not my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.  
  
My grandma and my mother have a really complicated relationship. My grandma has two kids ‚Äì my mum and my uncle. My uncle is the favorite. The golden child. He can do almost no wrong. And even if my grandma doesn‚Äôt like something he does, she would never tell him.  
  
Actually she‚Äôs not telling anyone if she doesn‚Äôt like something they do, most of the time. You can sometimes see it in her face, but she hates confrontation.  
  
My mum, even though she always had this very complicated relationship with her, never said anything bad about her to me, when I was younger. I was the only grandchild back then and had a special relationship with my grandma. We did a lot together and I love her very much.  
  
I also love my mum more than I could ever put into words! She did a lot for me and always made sure I am okay. She was a single mother and it was just us. Looking back she probably didn‚Äôt cut the contact because 1. She needed a bit of help and 2. (and most important) she wanted me to have a good relationship with my grandma (in hopes that it would be better than hers).  
  
There is a lot of hurt that my mum has because of my grandma. Its from childhood things but also events that happened throughout the years.

Last weekend something ‚Äúminor‚Äù happened, that I am afraid could be her last straw‚Ä¶  
  
She has a dog now for 2 years. A wild little, mixed race, dog that she loves very much! Unfortunately he‚Äôs not very trained. My mum knows that and she tries her best, but it takes a long while.  
  
This dog comes with her everywhere, cause he can‚Äôt be alone at home. (Also something she should train, I know!) So he was at my grandmas quite a few times now and loves her garden and that he can play so much. However‚Ä¶ He was always the only dog there!  
  
Now my cousin got a dog. A pure bread dog, that is still very young. She goes to a trainer with him (which my mum has no money for). So that dog is pretty chill and listens. I got the feeling that the dog is pretty chill in general tbh. Just a character thing.  
  
So now my cousin asked my grandma if she can bring him too to which my grandma said yes. She probably was thinking that it‚Äôll be fine and also she cannot really say no.  
  
Turns out, as we thought, that wasn‚Äôt a good idea. Although my mums dog sniffed curiously and was chill for about a minute when the dog was at the entrance of the house, he absolutely lost it, when the other dog came in. He was barking a lot and very loud and we couldn‚Äôt calm him down.  
  
My grandma was almost yelling ‚ÄúThis dog has to listen!!!‚Äù, but obviously that was territorial behaviour. My mums boyfriends, who is also very involved with the dog, took him for a short walk. When they came back, they went to the kitchen with him. My mum later went on another long walk with him, just to get him out of the situation and calm everyone a bit.  
  
My grandma couldn‚Äôt understand why they wouldn‚Äôt sit down with us to have coffee and cake. But how could they? The dog was still too upset and that would‚Äôve meant to bring him even closer to that situation.  
  
My mum was outside in the garden with the dog most of the time. I played with him a lot too and my mum never left the kitchen with the dog. My grandma came in and I, once again tried to tell her, that my mums dog never was in a situation like that, where another dog tried to get into his territory. That it‚Äôll take a while to get him used to itand that it wasn‚Äôt a good idea to force that onto him during a family gathering.  
  
She then said that next time we should do gatherings like that at my uncles, cause maybe that would help bevause it‚Äôs not his territory.  
  
That absolutely didn‚Äôt help with my mum. She once again feels like my grandma never even tries to understand her.  
  
I have to mention here, that our situation with the other part of the family, mainly my uncles wife and her daughter (that she brought into the marriage) is very tense. I always told my grandma that I am holding the peace until she‚Äôs no longer with us. For her! Because I know that when we decide to cut the contact with that part of the family, it will be devastating for her. And I do love her, so I don‚Äôt want to put that stress on her.  
  
That part of the family is also VERY judgemental. They have dogs. 3 in total (plus the one my cousin has, but she‚Äôs moved out). When they are out of the house, for work, the dogs have to be in small boxes. The once you would use for your car. So they are in there most of the day and during the night. But they want to tell us how to handle the dog.  
  
That‚Äôs not the only part where they are very judgemental. I could tell a few stories, but I don‚Äôt want to make it longe than it already is.  
  
The point of the story is: My mum is now thinking she wants to cut the contact with all of them. I want to talk to my grandma but I have absolutely no idea how to get the point across that she might loose her daughter over this. Cause she will think it‚Äôs very dramatic to cut contact just for this, when it is not just that situation, but everything that has piled up since her childhood for over 60 years now.  
  
I wouldn‚Äôt blame my mother if she would cut the contact.  
  
Heres where I might be an asshole‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want her to loose the inheritance that waits at the end of this afzter she went through all that pain.  
  
My mum said that she absolutely believes that my grandma already changed her will in favour of my uncle. That would ultimately also screw me over. (In the long run).  
  
I don‚Äôt know how I can start this conversation with my grandma. I don‚Äôt want her to loose her daughter for good and I don‚Äôt want my mum to loose her inheritance. What should I do??  
  
Ps.. Not getting involved is also not an option, cause I know that if I don‚Äôt talk to my grandmother nothing will change an she won‚Äôt even think of anything she might have done wrong. Also my mum asked me to talk to her and I want to do that for her. I just don‚Äôt know how and what I can tell her.",1,1733414927.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

1h7clyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1h7clyu/grumpy_entitled_boomers_coffee_shop_outing/,Grumpy entitled Boomer‚Äôs coffee shop outing,"So last weekend I was out with my husband walking around our city on Black Friday. Think tons of tourists and holiday shoppers because our downtown has lots of little shops, restaurants, etc. It is also a small coastal town so shops are small and can be cramped. 

My husband and I decide to grab a hot chocolate because it‚Äôs cold so we head towards a small coffee shop. There‚Äôs a group of women ahead of us also clearly heading into the coffee shop. All of a sudden this boomer probably in his late 60s early 70s says ‚Äúexcuse me ladies!!‚Äù and drags his (much younger) wife through the group ahead of us to get into the coffee shop first. Everyone was kind of caught off guard and let it go. 

Then we‚Äôre in line, boomer finally gets to the counter and has the following exchange with the college age barista: 

Barista: what can I get for you? 
Boomer: a black coffee. 
Barista: sure, anything else?
Boomer: uh, I guess whole milk.
*Barista rings him up then grabs his cup and goes to write his name on it*
Barista: and this was just black, right?
Boomer: No! That‚Äôs not what I ordered!!
Barista: oh, right! You wanted milk too, sorry about that. 
Boomer: have you got it now or do I need to repeat myself?
 
His attitude and voice was sooooo unbelievably rude too, he was just pissed to be there. Then he asked her ‚Äúwhere should I wait for my coffee‚Äù she recommends the WARM tented area literally 6 feet from the counter (where his wife was already waiting) and he goes ‚Äúno. I‚Äôm waiting here‚Äù. Okay dude then why did you even ask? He proceeds to stand right in front of the counter where everyone else is trying to order and pay. 

Later a young guy came up and asked to hop in front of my husband and I because he was missing a baked good he ordered. We said,  sure! Of course. The Boomer sighs loudly and mumbles something like ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù KEEP IN MIND IT DOESN‚ÄôT AFFECT HIM AS HE HAS ALREADY ORDERED. 

He then proceeds to ask the guy making drinks if every single one that comes out is his. The guy making drinks (to his credit) goes ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know what you ordered‚Äù which was hilarious because he definitely did know because he was standing there when boomer ordered and watched the whole exchange. He then proceeded to glare at everyone in the shop as if we‚Äôd personally wronged him. 

Boomer gets his coffee and tells his wife he‚Äôs leaving. She was like, ‚Äú‚Ä¶oh, you don‚Äôt want to sit out here for a little?‚Äù and he replies, ‚Äúno I‚Äôm done with this place‚Äù

Absolutely wild in my opinion for someone to be so pissed that other people exist in a crowded tourist town on BLACK FRIDAY. The rudeness to the poor barista was so uncalled for too, she was clearly frazzled as there were about 10 people in line and it was obvious they‚Äôd been slammed all morning. I feel bad for boomer‚Äôs wife who must be miserable and honestly for him too, it must suck to be that way. 

I wanted to step in and tell him off (worked in retail and restaurants all through my teens and early 20s so know how it feels to be treated like shit) but didn‚Äôt want to make it worse or more awkward for the employees so didn‚Äôt say anything. ",3,1733414793.0,BoomersBeingFools,3,1.0,False

So I‚Äôve been on vy 60mg for a month now (worked my way up of course) but I feel like I can only feel improvement in focus for about 1-2hr every day. The rest of the day I just feel calm which is good, but also too calm to act on anything. And if I take it after 10AM I won‚Äôt sleep.
So I have to decide every day if I use my focus ability to drive somewhere (I struggle with focus while driving a lot)
Or if I study for the time, or if I rather go to the gym. But I can only do one thing in the morning and the rest of my day unfortunately is just brain rotting.
Now I asked my psych about dexie top ups but he said it‚Äôs bad practice to do so. I tried Coffee but it‚Äôs just making me anxious instead of focused.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bulk Cooking Oils** ‚Äì We used to do this, but now we are buying beef tallow and olive oil in bulk from costco.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Quality Meats** ‚Äì Not all cuts are viewed as equal.  We usually go for a choice ribeye over a prime sirloin.  Ribeye on a menu just sells more.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Disposable Gloves** ‚Äì Stock up on this kitchen necessity, a no brainer.  You can never have enough.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Produce in Bulk** ‚Äì Stretch your dollar with staples like onions, potatoes, and tomatoes.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Cleaning Supplies** ‚Äì Industrial-grade products to keep your kitchen spotless.  We much prefer restaurant depot for this as opposed to Eco Lab.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Coffee and Tea** ‚Äì This is more for our staff, we prefer La Colombe or higher quality coffee for guests.  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **Spices and Dry Goods** ‚Äì Flour, sugar, salt‚Äîbuy in bulk and keep your pantry full.  Another no brainer.  
8Ô∏è‚É£ **Disposable Serveware** ‚Äì Great for catering, takeout, or quick-service restaurants.  Takeout has become a huge part of our business, it's shocking how many guests seem to not have silverware at home!  
9Ô∏è‚É£ **Frozen Desserts** ‚Äì Easy menu additions that require minimal prep.  We love frozen desserts.  Reduces our labor and adds significant $$ to the check.  
üîü **Food Storage Containers** ‚Äì Durable, stackable, and kitchen essentials.  Another no brainer.  Can never have enough quart containers and cambros.

1h7chmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h7chmx/she_wont_respond_to_a_request_for_a_third_meeting/,"She won't respond to a request for a third meeting, can I ask if she's cooled off (for my closure)?","Hi Guys, I (33M) met this lady at a party (34F) at my friends place, we chat for about an hour there from her career to her interests etc, I didn't get her number that night but got her number at a block party a few days later saying that I'd enjoyed chatting with her the other night but wanted to get to know her in a sober setting, so I invite her to coffee right by her place and we meet for a few hrs and chat until closing.

Our second meeting happens about two weeks after this and we do minigolf and drinks mid November, we both acknowledge having lost track of time hanging out with each other and before we part ways I ask her if she wants to hang out again and she agrees, she mentions thx giving weekend can't work but she'll let me know about the week before and then on Nov 21 she says she doesn't have time before thxgiving. So I told her to have a great trip back home and that I was thinking about Xmas themed stuff when she gets back. No response here.

Fast forward to yesterday and I text her a link to this Christmas festival/exhibition that's open through December and told her I'd like to go with her to that this week or next and maybe squeeze in axe throwing, it's been almost a day and no response.

I can digest and accept that she's probably not interested but  in another day or two, can I say something like ""hey there, I should have mentioned that if you've cooled off that's totally cool and I wish you the best, all I ask is that you lmk if that's the case?"" Or something more polished than that.

Basically my thought is that while I'm not entitled to her attention or companionship I would like the basic courtesy of being told that she's not feeling it as opposed to being straight ghosted after what seemed like several hours of us having a good time.

# Introduction to Qai

Hey there! Ever dreamed of having your own Quora-like website, but thought it'd be too complicated or time-consuming? Well, I've got some exciting news for you. There's this new tool called Qai that's shaking things up in the world of website creation. It's like having a super-smart robot assistant that builds a question-and-answer site for you in less time than it takes to make a cup of coffee!

Qai is the brainchild of Seun Ogundele, and it's all about making life easier for folks who want to create content-rich websites without the hassle. It's designed to tap into the huge potential of user-generated content platforms ‚Äì we're talking about a market worth a whopping $146 billion!

But here's the kicker: Qai doesn't just build a website. It creates a fully-functioning, SEO-friendly, money-making machine that works around the clock. Sounds too good to be true? Let's dive in and see what Qai is all about.

# Features and Content of Qai

Alright, let's break down what Qai brings to the table. It's packed with some pretty cool features that make it stand out from the crowd.

# AI-Powered Question Finder

First up, Qai has this nifty AI engine that scours the internet for the hottest questions people are asking. It doesn't just stick to one place either ‚Äì it pulls questions from Google, Quora, and other popular platforms. This means your site is always up-to-date with what people really want to know.

# Automatic Answer Generator

Now, finding questions is one thing, but Qai goes a step further. It doesn't just leave you with a bunch of questions to answer. Nope, it uses its AI smarts to create detailed, SEO-friendly answers to these questions. And we're not talking about some gibberish here ‚Äì these are proper, well-thought-out responses that actually make sense.

# Built-in Monetization

Here's where things get really interesting. Qai doesn't just create content; it helps you make money from it too. Each answer it generates comes with affiliate links and banner ads already baked in. So from day one, your site is set up to start earning.

# Niche Flexibility

Whether you're into health, finance, tech, self-help, or pretty much anything else, Qai's got you covered. It can create Quora-style sites for any niche you can think of. This flexibility means you can create multiple sites across different topics, all using the same tool.

# Continuous Updates

One of the coolest things about Qai is that it doesn't stop working after your site is live. It keeps running 24/7, constantly updating your site with new trending questions and answers. This means your site stays fresh and relevant without you having to lift a finger.

# Traffic Generation

Now, a website without visitors is like a car without fuel ‚Äì it's not going anywhere. But Qai's got that covered too. By focusing on trending questions, it naturally attracts organic traffic from search engines. It's tapping into those 8.5 billion daily Google searches, bringing a steady stream of visitors to your site.

# Benefits of Qai and Who Can Benefit from It

So, who's Qai for? Well, the short answer is: pretty much anyone who wants to create a content-rich website without the headache. But let's break it down a bit more.

# For Newbies

If you're new to the whole website creation thing, Qai is like a dream come true. You don't need any tech skills or coding knowledge. Heck, they even say a 13-year-old could use it! It takes care of all the complicated stuff, letting you focus on the fun part ‚Äì watching your site grow.

# For Busy Entrepreneurs

Got a million things on your plate? Qai can be your secret weapon. It creates and manages your site pretty much on autopilot, freeing up your time to focus on other aspects of your business.

# For Niche Marketers

If you're into niche marketing, Qai is a goldmine. You can quickly create authority sites in multiple niches, each one drawing in targeted traffic and generating income.

# For Passive Income Seekers

Dream of making money while you sleep? Qai sets you up for passive income success. Once your site is up and running, it keeps working round the clock, potentially earning you money 24/7.

# For Content Creators

If you love creating content but hate the technical side of running a website, Qai's got your back. It handles the infrastructure, letting you focus on refining and expanding on the AI-generated content if you want to.

# How to Profit from Using Qai

Alright, let's talk money. How exactly can you profit from using Qai? Here are a few ways:

# Affiliate Marketing

Remember those built-in affiliate links I mentioned? Every time a visitor clicks on one of these links and makes a purchase, you earn a commission. It's like having a salesperson working for you round the clock.

# Ad Revenue

Those banner ads that Qai automatically includes? They can be a steady source of income. As your site attracts more traffic, your ad revenue can grow.

# Sponsored Content

Once your site starts gaining traction, you might find companies willing to pay for sponsored content or product reviews. Qai gives you the platform; you can then leverage it for these additional income streams.

# Sell Your Own Products

Got a product or service of your own? Your Qai-generated site can be the perfect place to promote and sell it. The steady stream of targeted traffic can translate into potential customers for your offerings.

# Flip Websites

Once you've got the hang of creating successful sites with Qai, you could potentially create sites to sell. There's a market for content-rich, revenue-generating websites, and Qai makes it easier than ever to create them.

# How to Use Qai

Using Qai is designed to be super simple. Here's a basic rundown:

1. **Access**: First, you need to get access to Qai. This usually involves a one-time fee (more on pricing later). 
2. **Activate**: Once you're in, you activate Qai's AI engine. This is where the magic happens ‚Äì it starts building your authority website. 
3. **Choose Your Niche**: You'll need to tell Qai what kind of site you want to create. Whether it's health, finance, tech, or anything else, Qai can handle it. 
4. **Let Qai Work**: Now, you sit back and watch as Qai pulls top-searched questions, generates answers, and builds your site. This all happens in about 60 seconds. 
5. **Review and Refine**: While Qai does most of the heavy lifting, you can always review the content it generates and make tweaks if you want to add your personal touch. 
6. **Monitor and Scale**: Once your site is up and running, you can monitor its performance. As you see what works, you can use Qai to create more sites and scale up your online presence. 

# My Own Use Case Study for Qai as a Beta Tester

Now, I had the chance to take Qai for a spin as a beta tester, and I've got to say, I was pretty impressed. I decided to create a site in the personal finance niche ‚Äì you know, something that's always in demand.

I fired up Qai, told it I wanted a site about personal finance, and then sat back. In just under a minute, I had a fully functioning website. It was packed with questions like ""How to start investing with little money?"" and ""What's the best way to pay off credit card debt?"" ‚Äì real questions that people are actually searching for.

What really blew me away was the quality of the answers. They weren't just generic fluff; they provided real, actionable advice. And each answer had relevant affiliate links seamlessly integrated. For example, in the answer about investing, there were links to beginner-friendly investment platforms.

Over the next week, I watched as the site grew. Qai kept adding new questions and answers, keeping the content fresh. I started seeing traffic trickling in from Google searches, and even noticed a few affiliate link clicks.

Now, I didn't become an overnight millionaire or anything, but for a site that I spent virtually no time creating or maintaining, seeing any return was pretty exciting. It really drove home the potential of what Qai could do with a bit more time and perhaps across multiple niches.

# Qai Pros and Cons

Alright, let's get real for a minute. Every tool has its strengths and weaknesses, and Qai is no exception. Here's my honest take on the pros and cons:

# Pros:

1. **Speed**: Creating a fully-functional website in 60 seconds is pretty impressive. 
2. **Ease of Use**: You don't need any technical skills to use Qai. It's truly newbie-friendly. 
3. **Automation**: The fact that it keeps updating your site with fresh content without your input is a huge time-saver. 
4. **Built-in Monetization**: Having affiliate links and ads automatically included saves you the hassle of figuring out how to monetize your site. 
5. **Niche Flexibility**: Being able to create sites in any niche gives you a lot of options. 
6. **Traffic Generation**: By focusing on trending questions, it naturally attracts organic traffic. 
7. **Passive Income Potential**: Once set up, it can potentially generate income with minimal ongoing effort. 

# Cons:

1. **Limited Customization**: While Qai does a lot automatically, this means you might have less control over the specifics of your site's content and design.  
2. **Initial Investment**: While the front-end price is reasonable, accessing all features through OTOs can add up. 

# How Qai Dominates the Competition

In the crowded field of website builders and content creation tools, Qai stands out in several ways:

1. **Speed**: While other platforms might take hours or days to set up a functional website, Qai does it in 60 seconds. This speed is a game-changer for anyone looking to quickly establish an online presence. 
2. **AI-Powered Content**: Many website builders leave you to create all the content. Qai not only builds the site but fills it with relevant, SEO-optimized content. 
3. **Automatic Updates**: Unlike static websites, Qai keeps your site fresh with new content, helping maintain its relevance and search engine rankings. 
4. **Built-in Monetization**: Most website builders leave monetization up to you. Qai integrates income-generating elements from the start. 
5. **Niche Versatility**: While some tools specialize in specific types of websites, Qai can create authoritative sites in virtually any niche. 
6. **Traffic Focus**: Qai's approach of targeting trending questions naturally aligns with search engine traffic, giving it an edge in organic visibility. 
7. **Low Technical Barrier**: Many competitive tools require at least some technical know-how. Qai is designed to be usable by anyone, regardless of their technical skills. 
8. **Passive Income Model**: While many tools help you build a website, Qai's model is geared towards creating a passive income stream, setting it apart in terms of long-term value. 

By combining these elements, Qai offers a unique proposition in the market. It's not just about building a website; it's about creating a self-updating, traffic-generating, money-making online asset with minimal ongoing effort from the user.

# Qai Money-Back Policy

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""This sounds great, but what if it doesn't work for me?"" Well, Qai has got you covered there too. They offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.

This means you can try out Qai for a full month. If for any reason you're not happy with it, you can get a full refund. No questions asked. It's a pretty solid safety net that lets you give Qai a proper test run without risking your investment.

Remember though, refund policies can sometimes change, so it's always a good idea to double-check the exact terms on their official site when you're making your purchase.

[**Get Access to Qai here**](https://softtechhub.us/Qai)

# Qai Price

Let's talk dollars and cents. The front-end price for Qai is $17. This gets you access to the basic Qai platform, which is plenty powerful on its own.

Now, if you want to unlock more features, there are those OTOs we talked about earlier. These range from $27 to $297, depending on what extras you want.

Is it worth it? Well, that depends on how you plan to use it. If you're serious about creating multiple niche sites and scaling up your online presence, even the higher-priced options could potentially pay for themselves pretty quickly. But if you're just dipping your toes in the water, the front-end offer at $17 is a pretty low-risk way to get started.

Remember, with the money-back guarantee, you've got some time to figure out if it's a good fit for you before fully committing.

# Qai Bundle Deal

At the time of writing, I haven't seen any specific bundle deals for Qai. However, it's worth keeping an eye out for special offers, especially around the launch date.

Sometimes, these tools offer special launch bundles that include some of the OTOs at a discounted rate. If you're interested in multiple aspects of Qai, waiting for a bundle deal could save you some cash.

But remember, don't buy more than you need just because it's in a bundle. Start with what you think you'll use, and you can always upgrade later if you find you need more features.

# Who Created Qai

Qai is the brainchild of Seun Ogundele. Seun is known in the digital marketing world for creating tools that help entrepreneurs and marketers streamline their online businesses.

# When is Qai Launched

Qai is set to launch on December 4, 2024, at 10:00 AM EST. This launch date gives potential users a chance to prepare and perhaps budget for the purchase if they're interested.

Keep in mind that launch periods for these kinds of tools often come with special offers or bonuses, so it might be worth keeping an eye out for any launch specials if you're planning to give Qai a try.

# Qai Support

When it comes to support, Qai offers a support desk that you can access at[ https://fpsupportdesk.com](https://fpsupportdesk.com). This is where you can go if you run into any issues or have questions about using the tool.

Having a dedicated support desk is a good sign. It suggests that the creators are committed to helping users get the most out of the tool and are prepared to assist if problems arise.

Remember, when you're trying out a new tool, don't hesitate to reach out to support if you need help. They're there to ensure you have a smooth experience with Qai.

# Which Platform Can Qai Be Accessed On

Qai is a web-based application, which is great news for users. This means you can access it from any device with an internet connection and a web browser. Whether you're using a Windows PC, a Mac, a Linux machine, or even a tablet or smartphone, you should be able to use Qai.

This flexibility is a big plus. You're not tied to a specific device or operating system, and you don't need to worry about installing and updating software on your local machine. Just log in from wherever you are, and you're good to go.

# Should You Use Qai or Not?

Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. Should you use Qai? Well, like most things in life, it depends on your situation. Here are a few scenarios where Qai might be a good fit:

1. If you're new to website creation and feel overwhelmed by the technical aspects, Qai could be a great starting point. 
2. If you're short on time but want to create content-rich websites, Qai's automation features could be a real time-saver. 
3. If you're interested in creating multiple niche websites to diversify your online presence, Qai's speed and flexibility could be very useful. 
4. If you're looking to generate passive income streams, Qai's built-in monetization could give you a head start. 

On the flip side, Qai might not be the best choice if:

1. You prefer having complete control over every aspect of your website's content and design. 
2. You're already an experienced web developer or content creator with established workflows. 
3. You're looking for a highly customized, unique website that stands out from others in your niche. 

Ultimately, the decision comes down to your goals, skills, and resources. Qai offers a fast, automated way to create content-rich websites, but it's not a magic bullet. You'll still need to put in effort to make the most of it, especially when it comes to promoting your site and refining its content.

If you're on the fence, remember that there's a money-back guarantee. You could give it a try and see if it lives up to your expectations. Just be sure to really put it through its paces during the refund period so you can make an informed decision.

As with any tool, the key to success with Qai will likely lie in how you use it. It's not a ""set it and forget it"" solution, but rather a powerful starting point that can be enhanced with your own insights and efforts.

Whether Qai is right for you depends on your specific needs, goals, and how you plan to use it. If you're intrigued by the concept, it might be worth giving it a shot, especially with the money-back guarantee in place.

Remember, in the fast-paced world of online marketing and content creation, tools like Qai are constantly evolving. What matters most is finding the right tools that work for you and your business goals.

We ended up pulling the trigger on a new boiler due to the constant issues with the one we inherited when we bought the house. I was grateful to get the heat back on yesterday afternoon and they even replaced the old thermostats.

However, when I woke up this morning and sat down with some coffee, I could hear a really loud noise. I went down to check the boiler and it wasn't currently on, but I could hear the noise coming from just outside the window. Turns out the A/C had probably been running all night, or at least whenever the heat turns on. I'm pretty sure they botched the thermostat wiring. There's no ""cool"" or ""a/c"" option when I toggle modes, only ""heat"".

I've turned off the A/C unit at the breaker box for now and someone was already coming out on Tuesday for a quality control review, so they'll fix the thermostat wiring then. However, my A/C has now been running in low 30 degree weather during a wintry mix storm. I'm concerned about damage to the unit after reading about ""reduced efficiency"" that won't be plainly obvious and may give them an opportunity to avoid any responsibility. The first guy I talked to basically called it an urban legend about damage running A/C at low temps. What really sucks is I'm now looking at 5 months minimum before temps are back in the 60s to see how it's performing.

Any advice on what I should do? Is it warranted to demand they replace the A/C compressor?",1,1733414073.0,hvacadvice,1,1.0,False

After reading Dave Arnold's Liquid Intelligence, he is a big fan of carbonation with a mixture of co2 and n2o, but he doesn't provide many recipes for n2o drinks.
I definitely got the impression that n2o could be carbonated into a drink and you would have bubbles rising to the surface slowly, like looking into a champagne glass. Strangely, he doesn't really mention Nitrogen N2 much. 

Lots of resources online seem to focus on n2o's ability to infuse flavours, but don't really discuss carbonation. When they do mention carbonation, it seems to be more like the very fleeting kinds of bubbles that you get in nitro-coffee (which uses N2) with cascading bubbles that almost immediately rise out of the drink. Heck, the only recipe in Liquid Intelligence that calls for n2o is a n2o-carbonated espresso martini, but normally I would expect a ""nitro espresso martini"" to be done with N2

So my question is, are N2 drinks just the same in terms of mouth feel, visuals, foamy head, etc. as n2o drinks? Why does Dave Arnold never mention N2 gas in Liquid Intelligence? 

What n2o-carbonated drinks have you made and would recommend?

It's apparent that the hobby has been on the decline for a while, which is sad, but I'm hoping things will bounce back.

I actually learned how to brew at Four Horsemen Brewing, in South Bend Indiana, on a Sabco BrewMagic, and  was somehow asked to brew their house beer (English Pale Ale, which sucked) on their 30bbl system when their ""Master Brewer"" was not available. I was a beer blogger back then (when it was cool), and I think they were just using me to improve their poor reputation in the community. This is a bit of rabbit hole story. The ""Master Brewer"" that taught me was the infamous Stephen Foster (aka Scott Sala, among other aliases), he ruined at least 3 breweries, and negatively impacted many others. The ironic thing is that he actually did know how to brew and is (or was, not sure if he is still alive) an incredibly intelligent person, and he taught me a lot, but he had zero taste in beer. I liken him to being a classically-trained chef that has the knowledge to create amazing dishes, but preferred to serve under-done microwaved frozen pizza. He was an asshole, a racist, a con, and a coward, but I learned a skill from him that I'll have for life. There is a good story on him if you are interested in reading more. [https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/the-other-stephen-foster-story-kentuckys-craft-beer-con-man/](https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/the-other-stephen-foster-story-kentuckys-craft-beer-con-man/)

So back to my journey. Having to focus on my career in tech after learning from Stephen, I took many years off until coming back to it around 2018 with a Anvil AIO and a Spike Flex. At the time, my basement was my woodworking shop and not a great setup for brewing, and the garage was a pain, so although I enjoyed brewing, it just was not the right setup for me. Sold off most of my stuff (except the kegerator) and doubled-down on having my workshop.

My wife and I are now empty-nesters looking to buy some land and build our coffins (I mean forever home) in the next 5 years. Knowing buyers will probably not want a dusty cabinet-making shop, I renovated the entire \~1200sq ft space for my office, theatre area, kitchen and brewery. I wanted a bar, but I did not win that debate. The tradeoff for all of this money and work was that my wife was cool with me getting back into brewing and having a dedicated space, so I bought a Spike Trio and basically every accessory they offer. In our next home, I'll have a dedicated workshop and a dedicated brewery, so I'll be able to take this with me. If you would like to see my setup, here's a pic. [https://imgur.com/a/rkeNCG0](https://imgur.com/a/rkeNCG0) 

Part of the reason for wanting to get back into brewing is just not easily able to find fresh beer where I live to fit my taste, such as fresh west coast ipas, coffee stouts, roasty porters, well-crafted lagers, black ipas, etc. It will be an adventure developing my own recipes.

Tonight I will officially start doing some test runs, measuring boil loss, headspace loss, etc., etc., and I couldn't be more excited. I hope this post inspires someone to jump into the hobby, and crossing my fingers that we'll see a resurgence in the future. 

I'd love to hear your stories about getting back into the hobby after taking time off! Cheers!",10,1733413932.0,Homebrewing,2,0.92,False

1h7c4rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h7c4rt/turning_bagels_into_bitcoin/,Turning Bagels into Bitcoin,"Cheers to $100k everyone. Today is a great day, so I thought I'd drop a story here as inspiration for what has kept us hodling for years and stacking for the many more to come.

Like many of you, I've felt the pinch of the economic conditions over the past few years. I have a wife and kids and work a career job in the non-profit world. I love my family. I love my job. But I'm probably never going to see a six-figure salary in my lifetime. And that's ok: I chose this career path, try to live within my means, and don't want anyone to feel sorry for me when finances are tight. As I surveyed my family's financial situation during COVID, I had to be honest with myself that I would probably never see multiple commas in my financial accounts. But the more I learned about Bitcoin, the more I began to believe in Bitcoin. It truly could be my ace in the hole for building and preserving wealth for my wife, kids, and grandkids one day.

As inflation spiked my bills and ate away at the margins of my family budget, I knew something had to change... or even drop. It wasn't going to be contributing to my kids' college funds. It wasn't going to be contributing to my 403(b). *It wasn't going to be my weekly DCA into BTC*. But that meant I had to get creative to find an additional source of income. But what can you do if you're already working a 9-5 job and want to keep your evenings and weekends for your kids' soccer games or a dessert date with your spouse?

*Make bagels at 5:00am.*

I mean, I wasn't particularly busy at 5:00am. Not many of us are. My wife is still asleep. My kids are still asleep. Might as well turn some bagels into some money. I'm fortunate to have a good friend from college who's started a few successful restaurants in my town. One of them is a bagel shop that's become very popular. So I shot him a text seeing if he needed any help in the early mornings. He immediately offered me a job as a baker: *5-8am, a few hundred bagels per shift, a few shifts per week, as soon as I'm done baking the openers arrive and I can head to my regular 9-5 job*. Plus, I get to take a free bagel & coffee on my way out the door. Say less. I submitted my I-9 documents. Enrolled in direct deposit. Side-hustle secured.

It's been two years, and I couldn't be happier with how it's worked out. Sure, that 4:30am alarm can be brutal ‚Äî especially when my 4 year-old wakes up in the middle of the night, or my wife needs me to rock the baby to sleep so she can get some rest herself. But making bagels has given me the extra few-hundred dollars per month to be able to breathe again. Bagels now cover my utilities. That's been huge. But more importantly, *bagels turn into my Bitcoin*. Two years of keeping my weekly DCA going has made all the difference in my family's financial outlook. BTC is going to help me buy my oldest his first car. BTC is going to help me put my kids through college. BTC might just help my wife and I retire a little bit better than we deserve. Yeah, a chirping 4:30am alarm, a long day at my 9-5, a loud evening wrestling with my kids and vacuuming up Cheerios mashed into the carpet make me collapse into my pillow at 10:00pm... just in time to do it all over again the next morning.

But this is why we do it. This is the hope that Bitcoin gives us. The chance to do something different to build wealth. The chance to be creative at the margins, and turn the margins into gains. For most of us, our lives are pretty ordinary. But turning the ordinary into something extraordinary like Bitcoin is a special feeling. It's the feeling that keeps me going ‚Äî bleary-eyed, in the back of a fluorescent-lit kitchen while it's still dark outside. Who knew that bagels can turn into Bitcoin? Find your ""bagels,"" whatever that is. Turn it into some BTC, and enjoy the ride. I'll be right there with you.",3,1733413560.0,Bitcoin,1,1.0,False

But something about the grind size seems very strange to me. At some point I ended up just leaving it to the coarsest setting and not touching it at all, because that seemed to give me the best result, which is hilarious to think. Light, medium or dark roast, if I ever put it much finer than that, things started to get overextracted very quick. I simply can't get it too coarse for anything, in a way that I could clearly say ""this is definitely too fast"".

Decided to pick up this one recent coffee for example to show you. This one light to medium roast from Cusco Peru seems to produce a lot more fines than most coffees, which makes it difficult. The beans are quite hard and Pietro is fighting back a lot. The fastest total brew time I could get on a V60 was around 7 min.. (Pietro on the coarsest setting). I did 15g of coffee, 50sec bloom (swirling a bit), then one circular pour to 100g and later 2 long pours to the middle. No swirling movement or anything after the bloom, just letting it sit to avoid complete clogging. This one tasted ok (still a bit woody), but previously it was clearly hitting overextraction at setting 8.4 and clogged after the first pour..

I just came to the conclusion that at least 80% of the range of this grinder for me seems unusable for pour over, for most coffees (I mostly drink light or medium roast).

I attached some images of the grind on coarsest setting. To me it doesn't seem that ""unimodal"" as raved about? There are really big chunks as well as medium and fine particles. The grind quality really seems to improve when I go finer than 8, then it's like perfectly uniform. But those settings I don't use.. With one ethiopian I actually managed to use as fine as setting 5 without clogging, which was strange too.. Almost like sometimes coarser would be finer, because of the inconsistent grind quality towards the coarsest setting..

I've checked the burrs and their mechanics. There's nothing that would indicate any issues. It's just a very solid piece of design. Also cleaned it numerous times and it stays the same. The next step would be to check the alignment of course, but somehow I think that's not necessary because of the bulletproof design. I don't believe there's anything massively wrong there.

What do you think? To me this grinder just behaves very differently to anything I've experienced so far. Coming from a Specialita and Ode v1.1. I've never seen a grinder being so sensitive to different coffees.",1,1733413493.0,LanceHedrick,1,1.0,False

For reference, I have always taken a hair, skin and nails gummy for years prior to this and for the most part have had strong nails and long, relatively thick hair. And I‚Äôve been on these meds for 11 months. Right at about six months in, I started losing my hair and my nails became brittle and started breaking very easily. At that time, I was swimming daily so I thought my nails and hair were taking a hit from the chlorine (which probably played a small role). And then my hair started coming out in clumps and it really scared me! My nails were so thin and my hair felt almost crispy at the ends. 

I did a deep dive on all of the subreddits about Tirzepatide to see if other people were having the same experience and what they were doing about it. In retrospect, I now know that I was not prioritizing, protein or hydration, and because I was moving up in dosage way too fast, I was getting pummeled by side effects and just eating whatever I could get down. I decided to start getting serious about protein intake, I added collagen to my morning coffee (Vital Peptides Collagen), I started using electrolytes and got very serious about hydration as well, and I also stopped swimming and washing my hair so frequently. About a month later, my hair had stopped falling out in clumps. And now I‚Äôm 4 months into really working on it and it seems to be reversed. My nails are insanely strong and while my hair might not ever be as thick as it was, it‚Äôs definitely growing back, it‚Äôs healthier and NOT falling out anymore.

My wife and I are both women in our early 30s but I am the only one with a full time job and career. She is currently a part time barista and spends all her free time smoking weed. 

10 years ago, when we first started dating, she worked two service jobs to support us while I was in college. Once I graduated, I immediately found a full time job and have stayed in that career ever since. We both worked full time jobs for 3 years after that. 

Eventually she became tired of full time entry level work so she decided to go to back to school and I agreed to financially support us in that time. The plan was for her to finish her degree in 2 years, get a full time job in her field, and then we could save enough money to move. But that didn‚Äôt happen. 

She kept dropping classes, started smoking more and more weed, couldn‚Äôt manage her time. 4 years passed, and she was only 1 semester away from graduating but she couldn‚Äôt finish because of her inability to stay organized and focused. The schoolwork overwhelmed her and her main coping mechanisms are to avoid and get high. 

Since it is clear that she is not going to finish school, I have asked her repeatedly over the last year to get a full time job. It‚Äôs been 4 years and I am tired of having no money for myself, and constantly having to go into debt to afford our expenses. For example, she had a root canal last year that cost $1,500. I had to put it on a credit card and I still havent paid it off.

She has a part time job as a barista at a local coffee shop making $16 /hr plus tips. It‚Äôs 25 hours a week. In my opinion, it‚Äôs not nearly enough to adequately help support us but she LOVES the job. It‚Äôs fun and laid back. All her coworkers are super chill 22 year olds and they listen to music all day and have fun making drinks. Of course she loves it. Who wouldn‚Äôt? But I keep telling her that it‚Äôs not enough money and that I want her to find a full time job with a better salary. She refuses and says that she wants to become a manager at the coffee shop instead. But the thing is that the manager position is only a $1 raise and 30 hrs a week. It‚Äôs really not much more money. And who knows when a manager position will be open? And if they‚Äôll wanna give it to her? 
But she refuses to budge. Meanwhile, all of the financial burden falls on me and she is totally okay with that. So long as she gets to have fun at work and then come home and smoke a bunch of weed, nothing else really matters to her I guess. 

I‚Äôm so angry with this situation, it wasn‚Äôt the plan when we got married. It was supposed to be 50/50. Now I feel like I‚Äôm condemned to forever struggling financially to support us or divorcing and then I‚Äôd have to pay her alimony probably because she refuses to find better work. I feel like I am the only adult in the marriage and that I‚Äôm married to a selfish person.

Am I the asshole for wanting her to quit the job that she loves and find a better one so that we can be more financially secure? ",2,1733413339.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

[Delongi machine/Barraza grinder],"I have looked through posts in this sub covering similar problems and the common solutions/tips are to get a dosing funnel and to remember that different roasts have different densities. But here's the problem, I have a dosing funnel and 18g still seems to overfill my basket. Literally I can only get like 15g into this basket with little variation depending on roast.

The details:

Machine is a [DeLonghi](https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/manual-espresso-machine-ecp3420/p/ECP3420), not top of the line by any stretch of the imagination but it's what I got.

Coffee is a medium roast

Grinder is a Barraza Encore, grinding at 2

15g coffee in

25-second brew time is yielding 76(!)g of espresso out, which is a crazy ratio.

I have had this machine since 2020 and am just now starting to get more into ratios and doing things more ""right"" than my previous ""looks good enough let's see what happens"" method that yielded not too bad latte's imo.

There is a member of extended family (person A) who has been entitled to my child since before they were born, referring to them as things like ‚Äòour baby‚Äô, ‚Äòthe family‚Äôs child‚Äô. 

Since my child was born, this member of extended family has gotten married to person B. There is a significant age gap, and the couple originally met when A was early 20s and B was early teens. A was a mentor and private tutor to B and B moved into A‚Äôs home when they were 15. 

We have had private discussions with close members of the family asking that while we know it is difficult to avoid this person (and we aren‚Äôt asking anybody to do so) we would like to be made aware of who our child has been around, especially if it‚Äôs person A. 

Our child is only looked after by family on one day of the week. Coincidentally, person A only sees our child on this one day, there have never been any occasions of them ‚Äòbumping into‚Äô family etc on any other day or time. Person A has never been in touch with myself or my partner to arrange a meet-up, coffee, etc. but on multiple occasions has been around our child and then sent a message after the fact, often referring to themselves as ‚Äòaunty‚Äô and saying how they have been around our child while we‚Äôre at work. 

On all of the more recent occasions of this happening, we have not been made aware of person A being around our child by any other person. We only know because person A sends these texts. 

We felt as though it wasn‚Äôt fair to set the expectation of managing this relationship on any other person. So we messaged person A directly, asking them to limit the time they spend with our child, especially if neither parent is around. 

We‚Äôre now being accused of breaking up the family and causing irreversible heartbreak to person A and others. We have been told that we don‚Äôt have a right to determine who sees our child, as family members are entitled to a relationship. We‚Äôve been told by numerous family members that they are disappointed in our behaviour and ask that we apologise. 

AITA?

Hello guys and girls,

I am together with GF for 9 month now and everything was great but last weekend we had a major dispute which we settled however on the very next day. However, I had a weird feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right. I cannot explain it but see it as a sixth sense. My feeling got worse and worse and I decided to give myself clarity and looked into her phone without her knowing. Yes, I know, that‚Äôs bad and I shouldn‚Äôt have done it but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I saw a hidden WhatsApp chat with a guy who works with her at her job, it was in the archive but it was very recent like one day old and the chat contained just a conversation about having coffee together at work, which is not something that would freak me out normally. However, the conversation started out of nowhere and I had the feeling that the chat gets deleted frequently. So I waited a few days and had a chance to look it up again and the chat was gone. Completely deleted. Which wondered me even more‚Ä¶. So the next morning I asked her about this guy I saw on her IG (she had him there too) and asked her like if she works with him and if he has her number and if they chat sometimes. All of this she denied and told me she saw him at their Christmas party last year which I know were both lies. 

I don‚Äôt understand why she lies about this. If he is just a regular dude at her work, why lie about it? Why delete the chat and have it in your archive? So many questions and I don‚Äôt understand it at all. So, today I talked with her and admitted that I looked in her phone. I was brutally honest and she was in rage and tried to turn tables and that she is the victim and I did something wrong but she gave me no explanation at all for her behavior. Just that he sees him sometimes and she did not want me to see the chat pop up in WhatsApp when we look TikTok together and stuff but that is just BS for me. I am madly confused. I don‚Äôt think she cheated on me but why be so secretive about it ?

Well it's a lot ik but it's because my trainer also wants me now to lose weight because I have personally made a big fool of him tooo because I always use to say that *sir kal karlunga, parso karlunga* and he told me that *beta abh mai lagunga tumare peeche* and Apart from Being very friendly now i am seeing a strict version of him which i guess is very good for me only..

I have joined gym since 2023 and have reduced but it went completely waste due to my constant eating, My dad was transferred and I joined a new gym (the gym training i was taking about) from September and the same story continued that I was eating dominos every once in 2-3 days but from December,I became a different animal. It's been more than 1 week since I touched dominos (for me 1 week is like a year without pizza tbhüòÇüò≠) and it's going great but sometimes I eat Cheetos or lays because of salt craving.

My diet is

Morning - fruits and oats (but I will be ignoring oats)

Afternoon- green vegetables (boiled only no oil or a pinch of it unless needed) along with salad , no roti and rice (mom was against this, she was telling me that you can have ragi roti but I ignored. Ig it will only help me)

Evening - fruits or juice

Nights- it's optional. If I want to eat then either moong khichdi or sprouts (but I am not eating)


I am eating chips and Cheetos from last 2 days. But only 1 packet in a day. I have totally ignored tea and coffee and other sugar releted thing. No milk also. Sometimes as I said above that mummy gives roti compulsorily because of me not eating anything.

My weight is 100.7 (was 108 in 2023 then reduced to 95-96 after then I went to Delhi for a month or 2 and gained 5-6 kg) and now from 102 I am back at 100.7 (reduced to 98 once but kudos to my taste buds)

How much time it will take to be at 65-70kg. Should i focus on abs or weight loss only and is it okay to eat Cheetos or chips on daily basis because I have ignored all the other things

I woke up at 545 to take the dogs out, make breakfast, finish packing lunches, switch laundry, start the car, etc. By 705 fianc√© still wasn‚Äôt awake. I went and woke them up (which fianc√© knows I really don‚Äôt like doing because they are not a morning person and can be mean, and it stresses me out). 

At this point the kiddo is ready to go, boots and coat on at the door. I‚Äôm trying to get the dog medicated because it‚Äôs 716, and fianc√© has gone into the kitchen to make a cold brew coffee. Fianc√© asks why am I trying to medicate the dog (it‚Äôs normally their morning job) and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that we‚Äôre already late until I get to the door and they say a generic ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong? Sorry we‚Äôre running behind‚Äù. We don‚Äôt get out the door and into the car until 725. 

Now we‚Äôre in the car and I‚Äôm frustrated because not only are we late but the kiddo is asking me to get something from home for him for after school and tells me multiple places it could be. We get to school and I run him in. When I get back to the car there‚Äôs an awkward silence and fianc√© tells me I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten so overwhelmed about finding the item. I say she‚Äôs right and that realistically I‚Äôm just feeling really overwhelmed about leaving late. Fiance tells me that I‚Äôll still make it to work on time and when I explain that my frustration is more so associated with leaving late, they essentially tell me it‚Äôs not their problem that they have a flexible work schedule and I don‚Äôt, that they don‚Äôt have to operate their mornings on a tight schedule, and that they already apologized so they‚Äôre done with this conversation.. 

When I acknowledged that I‚Äôm really happy for them that they have that flexibility in the morning, but that this was not a regular morning and we had mutually agreed on what time we had to leave they started yelling. They said that they would do their best to never have to carpool with me again because clearly it was a big issue. They then started telling me that they‚Äôve already said they were sorry, and yelling about what on earth I wanted from this conversation. When I said that I wanted an apology and acknowledgement about ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm really sorry I slept in, I know it causes you a lot of stress to feel like you have to wake me up, and I‚Äôm sorry we weren‚Äôt able to leave on time‚Äù they once again told me they already apologized. I asked them to please stop yelling and the response was ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve already told you I‚Äôm done with this conversation. You‚Äôre pushing a fight and disrespecting my boundaries, so now I‚Äôve lost control and I‚Äôm yelling. You need to get help for the amount you push my boundaries because this is what happens otherwise‚Äù.

1h7boy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h7boy0/aitah_for_being_frustrated_with_my_fiance_for/,AITAH for being frustrated with my fiance for being late,"My fiances car is in the shop and today we were supposed to leave no later than 715 to drop the kiddo to school, fianc√© to the shop to pick up a loaner, and get me to work by 8 (the shop is 20 minutes across town). I woke up at 545 to take the dogs out, make breakfast, finish packing lunches, switch laundry, start the car, etc. By 705 fianc√© still wasn‚Äôt awake. I went and woke them up (which fianc√© knows I really don‚Äôt like doing because they are not a morning person and can be mean, and it stresses me out). 

At this point the kiddo is ready to go, boots and coat on at the door. I‚Äôm trying to get the dog medicated because it‚Äôs 716, and fianc√© has gone into the kitchen to make a cold brew coffee. Fianc√© asks why am I trying to medicate the dog (it‚Äôs normally their morning job) and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that we‚Äôre already late until I get to the door and they say a generic ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong? Sorry we‚Äôre running behind‚Äù. We don‚Äôt get out the door and into the car until 725. 

Now we‚Äôre in the car and I‚Äôm frustrated because not only are we late but the kiddo is asking me to get something from home for him for after school and tells me multiple places it could be. We get to school and I run him in. When I get back to the car there‚Äôs an awkward silence and fianc√© tells me I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten so overwhelmed about finding the item. I say she‚Äôs right and that realistically I‚Äôm just feeling really overwhelmed about leaving late. Fiance tells me that I‚Äôll still make it to work on time and when I explain that my frustration is more so associated with leaving late, they essentially tell me it‚Äôs not their problem that they have a flexible work schedule and I don‚Äôt, that they don‚Äôt have to operate their mornings on a tight schedule, and that they already apologized so they‚Äôre done with this conversation.. 

When I acknowledged that I‚Äôm really happy for them that they have that flexibility in the morning, but that this was not a regular morning and we had mutually agreed on what time we had to leave they started yelling. They said that they would do their best to never have to carpool with me again because clearly it was a big issue. They then started telling me that they‚Äôve already said they were sorry, and yelling about what on earth I wanted from this conversation. When I said that I wanted an apology and acknowledgement about ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm really sorry I slept in, I know it causes you a lot of stress to feel like you have to wake me up, and I‚Äôm sorry we weren‚Äôt able to leave on time‚Äù they once again told me they already apologized. I asked them to please stop yelling and the response was ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve already told you I‚Äôm done with this conversation. You‚Äôre pushing a fight and disrespecting my boundaries, so now I‚Äôve lost control and I‚Äôm yelling. You need to get help for the amount you push my boundaries because this is what happens otherwise‚Äù. The conversation was over after that and they made a snide remark about how I‚Äôm going to make them talk about it tonight. When I said I didn‚Äôt think I really wanted to talk about it again they said ‚Äúgreat. I don‚Äôt ever want to talk about this again‚Äù.

Andy Robbins was the kind of bear cub that had room illiteracy. Technology, the cell phone industry, and Gargoyle Translate had not added ""social cues"" into their language inventory. This meant that Andy would join up with an informal group of people for an ice cream meet, introduce himself, say something like, ""No relation to Baskin,"" and then sit in silence as the rest of the group cocked an eyebrow and then gave up on finding whatever it was that he just referenced.

A handful of times shouldn't have bothered him, but it wasn't a handful of times. This happened every month for the 3 years he'd started trying to socialize more. This time he'd gone too far. The group he'd joined up with was a coven of bats. He'd shown up dressed as a vampire, introduced himself, and revealed his blood time. ""I'm Type O. So I'm pretty sure I've got diet blood.""

He didn't get a blank stare this time. The bat who he presumed to be the leader , a scrawny blue guy with pale hair, a leafy nose and glasses, growled, ""Nobody's laughing. Are you deaf?""

Andy didn't answer. There was nothing for him to add to the conversation. He didn't belong there. Once again, he'd blown his chances at making new friends. Up until now, his standing with all these new groups had been ambiguous. Nobody had contacted him after he'd eased himself out, but nobody had directly kicked him out, either. This was different. This was the first time someone had directly shown dislike for something he'd done.

The coffee shop was crowded enough. They wouldn't notice if he excused himself to go to the bathroom and then slipped out the front door.¬† The waitress hadn't come by yet - he wasn't waiting on any food or beverage, so it would be no cost to the group. Nobody invited him into their conversation. No. He wouldn't be missed. Everyone was happy.

Except‚Ä¶ he wasn't happy. They didn't care if he felt included or not. That was what hurt the most.

He got back to his dorm room. Good - Wandwaver and Macrofuse weren't around, probably in class or at the library. He didn't much know them, let alone trust them enough to let them see his personal feelings.

Another bridge burned before it was even built. Social dyslexia. That's what he had. Another layer of anguish collapsed on him, perhaps the worst aspect of all of it: There was no one he could share this experience with. It was all bottled up like some tortured devil, howling for release. He could try therapy - if it wasn't so expensive. He could try the crisis hotline - but the last few times he called, the receptionist was so dismissive. ""Quit worrying about it, it's not that big a deal.""

He could practically hear the rolling eyes of his own private consultants, comparing his situation to the homeless, the people living in war-torn territories, the starving. ""People have it worse than you. Stop being a baby and get over it.""

And yet‚Ä¶ the knowledge of harsher circumstances somehow didn't exterminate his depression. He had the power to help other people, but he couldn't help them until someone, anyone, gave a damn about his struggles just to interact. He just didn't have the power to cope with this himself. If he could just cry it out, perhaps he wouldn't care so much.

He flopped down on his bed and cradled his overstuffed dragon plush, Hamster. And then his bed began to rattle of its own accord.

Andy began to panic. He knew who was on his way up. Toby Gibbleweb was a draconic technodweeb so corpulent that whenever he flew up to Andy's bedroom, all the furniture scooted to the walls. It was a good thing that the apartment was on the first floor - no Earthen architecture could survive that belly of his, even as soft and cushiony as it was.

Beyond the rattling bed, sequences of computer sound effects and the old-fashioned dial-up internet buzzes and beeps heralded his arrival, until with a tympanic, echoing belch, Andy's bed hopped up into the air, and then there was the overfed gourd of a dragon, usually up to issue a shipment of pretzels, popcorn or trail mix; his ""coding fuel,"" as he called it.

No, not him, thought Andy. Anyone but him‚Ä¶ if he sees me crying‚Ä¶ dammit, I can't hold back‚Ä¶ this is humiliating‚Ä¶

Andy lay on his side, trembling, clutching Hamster with all his might. He had his back turned to the roly-poly dragon, but he could hear the big guy yawn and stretch, ushering the bed closer to the closet.

""'Sup, Ange. Haven't perfected the size modification function yet, otherwise I'd go myself. I don't guess you'd have any Fritos, would ya?""

There was no saving face here. If Andy spoke or turned his head to nod, he'd choke on his own tears. If he lay there in silence, Toby would think he was snubbing him. Either way, he was about to learn how Toby reacted when he saw someone unhappy.

""Ange? You awake, man?""

He put a pudgy green claw on Andy's shoulder. The thing was big enough to cover up the whole of Andy's torso. The bear cub turned, and there on his face were two burning tear stains.

Toby withdrew his claw in alarm. ""Oh geez, did I just wake you up? My bad, man‚Ä¶ hey‚Ä¶ what's wrong?""

Andy looked up into his visitor's face. He didn't see any trace of disgust - rather, that unshaven, bespeckled guise beneath a black baseball cap displayed curiosity, worry, a bit of embarrassment, and - dare he say it? - empathy.

Andy swallowed. ""I had a bad time, and I'm not feeling well.""

Going further than that was risky. One wrong word, one careless revelation, and Toby could turn his back on him in an instant. Unfortunately, Toby was not the kind of individual who would settle for ""not feeling well.""

""A bad time?"" He leaned in. ""Did something happen?""

The risk wasn't completely eliminated, but there was no mistaking that look in his eyes - Toby was heartbroken to see someone else feeling so down. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

Dammit‚Ä¶ Andy did want to talk about it. But every time he talked about it, it turned into trauma dumping and scared away his friends. Why did Toby have to have such an unassuming personality?

""I screwed up a friendship,"" managed Andy. ""I told a joke nobody thought was funny, and‚Ä¶ I left the restaurant.""

Andy closed his eyes. He'd done it. He'd admitted everything he needed to. He didn't need to reveal just how heated the argument had grown, or just how embarrassed he was over his inability to let it go and move on. And having shared it, Andy couldn't hold back the tears any longer. Go on, he thought. See me for the basket case I really am. If I'm not a likeable person, so be it. I suck, and that's all there is to it.

""Oh‚Ä¶ man."" Toby got even closer. He scooped up the bear cub, to him no bigger than a doll, and held him close to his heart

""Hey man. Nobody has a perfect track record. I know what you're going through. You don't have to hate yourself over it. I know you don't get out much, but I can promise you, even the guys at the top of the 'food chain' muck it up at least a few times a year. I could tell you some real party bombs some of these guys pulled.""

Andy, through his tears, looked up into Toby's soft, kind face.

""And this group of guys‚Ä¶ well, I don't know who they were, but I promise, they've botched up, too. It just might take a while for them to realize they've done the same thing, and figure out how to talk it out.""

""It was a group of bats‚Ä¶ I don't want to gossip, or ruin anyone's reputation,"" he allowed.

""Oh."" Toby lifted his head. ""I know a few bats. If it's one of the guys I'm thinking of‚Ä¶ yeah, he can be kind of a piece of work. He's got a few anger issues and communication problems - getting along with him can be tricky even if you know him well.""

Andy could relax a little. He already knew he was imperfect - every social outing he'd attended reminded him of that. Hearing¬† a reminder that other people might share similar imperfections gave him a great deal of comfort.

""If you don't mind my asking, most of these groups you meet with, you don't know anybody all that well, do you?""

Andy nodded. This was true - everything had been a dive into uncharted waters. Now he started to see what the problem was.

""Tell you what - come to one of my lunch meets. You haven't seen awkward until you've met my group. Can't garauntee it'll work out with everyone, but you're sure to branch out there and meet some dergs who can connect you with the right people. It's kind of a never ending journey - no pressure. But we'd all love to have you over. That I can garauntee.""

Andy pulled out a tissue and blew his nose. ""Toby - this means the world to me. I wish I knew how to thank you.""

Toby winked. ""Fetch me some trail mix and we'll call it even.""

Seventeen years. Enough time to build a life, and enough time to slowly dismantle it, piece by piece, without even realizing you‚Äôre holding the hammer. I didn‚Äôt see it then. I thought I was doing my best. Thought love was something you just showed up for and that showing up was enough.

It wasn‚Äôt.

Lesson one: love doesn‚Äôt wait for you to figure it out. It doesn‚Äôt sit patiently in the corner while you chase whatever it is you think will make you whole‚Äîmoney, pride, freedom, some half-baked idea of success. She was trying to love me, but I was too busy trying to outrun my own shadow.

I made her small without meaning to. Took her laughter for granted, her kindness as a given, like she‚Äôd always be there, no matter how often I looked past her. Love isn‚Äôt a safety net, though. It‚Äôs a mirror. And I broke it.

Lesson two: words matter. The ones you say and the ones you don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt say enough of the right ones. But more than words, actions matter. I never made her a cup of coffee. If she felt like eating something really good, I would just get it delivered online. I never bought her a gift. Instead, I gave her money to buy whatever she wanted.

She tried. God, she tried. And I kept fumbling, kept letting the days pile up like unread mail. I thought we had forever to get it right.

Lesson three: time isn‚Äôt the solution. It‚Äôs the crime scene. You look back and see all the moments you could‚Äôve done something‚Äîanything‚Äîdifferent, and they‚Äôre just lying there, untouched.

I signed the papers without looking at her, not because I was angry, but because I couldn‚Äôt face the man I had been. She deserved better, and I knew it. It wasn‚Äôt her job to wait around for me to figure out how to be that man.

Lesson four: forgiveness isn‚Äôt something you ask for; it‚Äôs something you earn. Not from her‚Äîshe owes me nothing‚Äîbut from myself. I‚Äôm still working on that part.

Seventeen years taught me how easy it is to love someone without learning how to care for them. How love isn‚Äôt a thing you possess, but a thing you practice. And how, if you don‚Äôt, it slips away quietly, like a tide leaving the shore.

I hear her laugh sometimes, in my head. I remember the way she‚Äôd squint when she smiled. And I hope she feels happy, eventually. She deserves that.

Lesson five: sometimes, losing someone is the only way to find yourself. I‚Äôm still here, picking up the pieces, trying to build a life that won‚Äôt fall apart.

It was all my fault. But maybe that‚Äôs the hardest lesson of all‚Äîthe one where you learn to live with that truth and let it make you better, not bitter.

Is it because of the beans or the grinder 
I use a generic ceramic burr grinder with medium fine adjustment, tried with coarse grind as well but not much help 

Secondly I used pre ground lavazza Rossa coffee grind size for moka pot but that too is mostly sour

For months I would go to toilet terribly 10ish times a days with a blood, my stomach would always be upset. I was bulking, so a lot more calories. 
From say May it got much better, I was cutting, so much less calories. During the summer I pretty for 3 months had no symptoms at all. 
October rolls up and I start bulking again, colitis comes back, absolutely terrible, worse then before i reckon. It last till for 2 months. It was hell, some days I would only eat yogurts to relax my stomach. But now a week and half ago it randomly stopped. And I have normal 2 times a day bowel movment (I eat a lot so). Is this normal? 
A week ago i got my results on intolerance food test. Im intolerant to so so many things I would regularly consume, from milk, eggs, coffee, coca cola, wheat, orange, oil etc. So i just kicked out all of them. And i feel great. But that is not the reason why my symptoms stopped, cause they stopped few days before. 
I noticed the symptoms would stop when I would take few days where I only eat yogurts and probiotic drinks. 
So I reckon if I keep this diet where I don‚Äôt eat foods that intolerant to, I might be saved haha.

Hello total stranger ! Let‚Äôs not be strangers and get to know each other in excruciating detail ..jk ‚Ä¶or not . 

I‚Äôm just a girl ! Looking for someone to chat with daily ,spread dumbassery and be silly with . 

About me : I have adhd , I have not only a coffee addiction but a tea one too ! Ultimate combination if you ask me ;)currently im watching a Dutch show called lang leve de liefde .I‚Äôm no incredibly great at anything nor am I special in anyway I like things that most humans like , going on walks , baking, reading , watching YouTube about random topics that will never come up in daily conversation. I make a new playlist for every new vibe, mood, feeling or memory I have . I‚Äôm addicted to nicotine but also really embarrassed about it . And that‚Äôs all the oversharing I‚Äôm willing to do right now 

Looking for :
-a long term friend to text daily 

-someone that doesn‚Äôt make me do all the work in conversation even though I can yap a lot sometimes

-someone that doesn‚Äôt just have 1 playlist of all their liked songs ( lol ) 


Does that sound good ? If yes text me;) if no text me anyways ;))

I got an Essenza mini on Black Friday and was super happy. I got a bunch of pods. But when I tried to re-create the Americano I usually get from the coffee shop, the Americanos I‚Äôm making are pretty weak. I think I‚Äôve got the ratio of coffee to water down with two espresso shots and a lungo water shot, but it still doesn‚Äôt taste that good. I‚Äôve tried less intense pods and more intense pods but nothing‚Äôs really working for me. 
Does using distilled water really change the game? Is there anything else I could try to make a strong Americano? 
Obviously, I could do less water and more shots but I feel like if this is really quality coffee then I should be getting some flavor coming through and I‚Äôm feel like I‚Äôm not getting that. Obviously an Americano is watered down espresso but those really good strong americanos just hit different and I‚Äôm trying to crack the code. ",3,1733410688.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False

As far as I know, he‚Äôs only been in a relationship with a Leo and Taurus. He‚Äôs never been with an Aries before. I know he looks at astrology but tells me he doesn‚Äôt believe it. 

Maybe I‚Äôm looking at this wrong, but I feel like he already has painted me as this short tempered ram that will go to the extremes. 

A couple of times I woke up and got out of bed before him. Went out and had some coffee and he comes out a few minutes later saying that he thought I left. I asked him why, he says he thought I tried to wake him up and he snapped, but that never happened. I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôve ever attempted to wake him up. Another time I got up before him and went to the bedroom for some close. He was quick to react that he was getting up as I stepped in the room. I wasn‚Äôt there to wake him up. I know he‚Äôs told me that he‚Äôs pissed of his Taurus ex that‚Äôs tried to wake him up, but I wouldn‚Äôt think another Taurus would go to the extreme and walk out without saying something or could I be wrong? Something recent happened where we got into a disagreement. In my head it wasn‚Äôt even an argument because we didn‚Äôt even go back and forth or yell at each other. He goes outside to do some yard stuff and I went to bed to take a nap. Periodically he would come back in to check on me, and I‚Äôm thinking he was checking to see if I left.

I‚Äôve never done anything extreme as in getting up to leave after a disagreement or destroyed property. He has close friends that have done those things, but I haven‚Äôt. 

Can any Taurus tell me why he‚Äôs doing this because the periodic check ups on me to see if I would leave is making me uncomfortable. He‚Äôs a great guy, but I‚Äôm wondering if there is something about Aries that makes a Taurus act this way.",3,1733410486.0,Taurusgang,6,1.0,False

Obviously, not everyone‚Äôs.  Many of them have literally made my jaw drop.  I feel such powerful empathy or sympathy most times.  It‚Äôs just such a bizarre experience.

Has anyone else wished they could meet someone else‚Äôs person?  Just once?

If I could be armed with the knowledge that this was X‚Äôs person in advance, but that person had no clue that I knew who they were, I would totally do it.

It‚Äôs a weird curiosity on my part.  I do think it‚Äôs weird of me.  But if those criteria could be met, I don‚Äôt think I would be able to resist.  I would want to see it with my own eyes.

If they drank, I‚Äôd absolutely sit down and have a beer or two with them.  If they didn‚Äôt, coffee or lunch would suffice.  Hell, even a smoke break.  Every now and then, I‚Äôll read a new story or an update and think ‚ÄúWhat the fuck, who is this person?‚Äù

If anyone else met mine, I‚Äôm curious if you‚Äôd notice it or not.  When you‚Äôre low-stakes to her, she‚Äôs so fun and interesting.  She‚Äôs so smart and can be really focussed.

So, after 1 or 2 Buyers like this in the beginning, when I meet up with a Buyer now I ask them to let me know when they are parked at the Meetup spot, because 99% of the time people are never on time. The Meetup spot is literally 2 blocks from my house. I ONLY leave my house when they message me that they are parked. I'm glad this works out for me because yesterday I had 3 Buyers at the same time, 1 No Show, and the other 2 were 30 to 40 minutes late. Yup. Now, if I would have left my house, I'd be waiting in my car wasting MY time. All 3 Buyers were aware to message me when they are parked (the first Buyer never messaged me back, so I know she was a No Show). The other 2 were at least communicating that their ETA is 30 minutes. So, in case this would be beneficial for other Sellers, this has worked for me great. But make sure, you already have the items in your car, so you can leave the minute they message you. Again, the Meetup spot is 2 blocks from my house. By car it's a 1 minute drive. It's a local coffee shop that's open late with cameras and well lit parking lot. Ironic too, the 2 other Buyers didn't even apologize for running super late.

Even sa best friend ko. I always listen to their problems but they never heard me telling my deepest pain. Pag nag kukumustahan or nag coffee date kami sinasabi ko lang stress ko sa acads and now stress sa work. Alam lang nila na may nanliligaw sakin but I never tell them the details about that person.

& let me just say.. WTFF????? why was the last season all about the nasty & cheating?? 

i was actually in complete shock seeing anne getting hot & bothered abt that 18 yr old when she herself broke her palm abt lionel kissing (grazing) tom√©. at the same time, he‚Äôs EIGHTEEN & was talking abt wanting to taste alice when she got off. finding out alice & seamus were dating was the thing to finally snap anne back into her old self but with less temper ig. there should‚Äôve been a scene of anne giving the talk to alice, however it looks like it wasn‚Äôt needed seeing as it wasn‚Äôt alice‚Äôs first time doing it. so if she made it this far without getting prego then she‚Äôs ok. i do think that her going to australia was such a big stretch to show her becoming more independent. 

kate. what the actual hell. why didn‚Äôt u immediately back ram off once he started to feel some things for u??? oh bc u felt the same? are u serious? what is up w this hypocrisy???? is ‚Äúi‚Äôm married, ram. stop‚Äù so hard to say??? and NJ??? him being rlly sexual was kinda weird. it was nice seeing a teen being so open to their parent abt their relationship compared to alice still not being able to trust her mother enough to tell her abt her life but man, seeing that box of condoms was.. something. also can i j say that they should‚Äôve dropped that alice vs anne formula *before alice thinking she could be a therapist. 

val also cheated which was crazy but in her mind it was justified bc she thought mel was cheating, & he wasn‚Äôt he was proposing but they still won at the end getting married after all. but why the hell was the milk-bank-baby-got-sick from her breast milk not resolved?? they j completely went over it. we should‚Äôve also seen scenes of her boys taking care of jackie. 

i feel like sloane was overreacting when she found out that paul was engaged for like atp 3 days when he was 22. that was 20 yrs ago sloane cmon. her plot was ok, in the end she accepted the fact that she cannot handle mom & work at the same time & tbh she should‚Äôve gotten a heads up from kate abt having to sacrifice A LOT, that could‚Äôve been helpful. we could‚Äôve seen a scene where sloane goes to kate for help abt juggling mom life & work life.

jenny. isn‚Äôt it just so amazing giving all this development to a character at the finale of s6 then j stripping it all awayüòç?? loveeeeee to see it. my fav honestly. her backstory doesn‚Äôt rlly explain why she‚Äôs such a b!tch. but whatever. u can tell that they struggled fully writing jenny back into the show after ian‚Äôs actor left. also that whole jenny & gary was weird. like super.

i think that was part of the shows reason why it completely went to trash after s5. well s4, actually no s3. when ian‚Äôs & frankie‚Äôs actors left, they had to work w what they had left & had to create some other out of character plot lines to make up for the lost characters. these new plot lines: jacob, joseph & their jackie, val‚Äôs milk, NJ & his s3x life, jenny & gary, etc needed time to flesh out & bc they didn‚Äôt have that time to flesh out bc it was the last season, they had to cut them short & fill in w some pre existing plot lines, ex: val getting $ from her milk after crystal abandoned her family. after val discovering she can still pump, they made her plot abt that & dropped jacob & joseph‚Äôs plot line. i mean, they completely cut off the goldie‚Äôs goodness arc after the s6 finale. we never found out why ginnie went against her mother & why goldie was the way she was. when they brought back that character from the very first ep, ik it was gonna get worse from here on out. they did a bad job filling in for those 2 major character losses given they were rlly loved by the audience. they wrap up a plot lines w one line said by a character & open another one. when anne dismissed the charges for that stalker, i feel like it was bc lionels cochrane bennett took half the 6th season & they didn‚Äôt even do a good job. so ig they decided for anne‚Äôs turn is to forget abt it. another complaint is the fact that the kids were completely forgotten. it was more abt the moms than 50% working moms & 50% home moms. no developments for charlie, ella, jayme & zoe. ik they‚Äôre toddlers but around this time, it should be hell for these moms to work around their growing children. but no, they‚Äôre alr shown talking & getting put into the background. seriously, seeing charlie & ella shoved w ipads was sad. what do they even eat?? ordered pizza for the 79th time? j a couple more things guys: i hate that a plot line stays frozen until the next time the characters are on screen. ex: anne vs alice: who‚Äôs the better therapist? why was that conflict only talked abt in anne‚Äôs office? alice should‚Äôve gotten a serious scolding when they got home but no, it only stays at her office & honestly she should‚Äôve gotten fired alice wayy sooner when that creepy woman kept coming for alice. mcp & jenny only talking abt their fake marriage at work. do they not meet after work? yes they do but only for wedding planning. all this bc 20 min isn‚Äôt enough for the amount of characters, & ep in each seasons. 

i wanna wrap this up w things i did like abt these last 2 seasons:
that segment with that off brand froot loops was funny. seeing the most dumbest characters in one room was gold. 
i will always love off-plot eps like the LSD ep, spooky bacholerette, val‚Äôs bday & alice coming of age party. 
there‚Äôs these 2 specific scenes where i laughed hard. when lionel came home to alice, seamus & anne & finally found tula, the shot of the coffee table being smashed w the bat was so funny. then val‚Äôs ex kicking the trash can in the park. this show is so calm & steady that seeing those bursts of like, idk shots were funny.
it was surprisingly very nice seeing rosie, mo & richard follow kate after quitting sulubra. even though the fact that kate quitting after one time of bad feedback was off, it was nice seeing that kate has been working w them for over 7 years (more w richard obv) & them backing her up.

So my MIL is basically a minimalist. Wouldn't describe herself as such, but it fits. However, all suggestions ive seen here....dont work for her...

She: Doesnt drink, doesnt like coffee, doesnt really want expensive tea, doesnt really like any consumables, doesnt care for most experiences, doesnt care for subscriptions, doesnt really read, etc im probably forgetting some of the suggestions ive seen here.   
I would get her more household related stuff, as i have seen people mention those too, HOWEVER, It feels very icky to buy my MIL like...household supplies, and my FIL a star wars figurine or something.

In the long run, this will only make me feel worse. But right now? I feel like I need to feel something other than <<internally screaming>>. I'm worried that I'll regain the 90 pounds I've worked so hard to lose over the past 17 months.

My best friend... former? Longest friend? Pretty much my only constant in life since 8 years old is schizophrenic. She went off her meds and got really bad a year ago. She'd text and call and leave awful, vicious messages using my worst fears, insecurities, and experiences against me. Blocking her number made it worse because she'd just get a new one. Changing my number would be a difficult step because I've had this number half of my life.

She got better for a while. She sent me a long apology, promised to go back on her meds and stay sober. She said she needed me, everyone else abandoned her. She was living out of her car and had been arrested twice. She begged me to please just be there to talk to her.

Things were fine for a few months, then this week she started with the angry calls again. Accusations, insults, threats.

I need surgery. I found out the first week of November when I went to the doctor for a cough I couldn't shake. They checked me for pneumonia and found a length of my intestine had permeated my diaphragm and I was at risk of serious bowel obstruction. I was hoping to get it done before the holidays so I'd have time to recover but nothing was available until mid January. So I wait.

I was laid off from a job I loved, where I'd only been for 7 months. I was really starting to hit my stride and feel like I was doing well, then I had the rug torn out from under me and my position was eliminated. I was laid off just after Thanksgiving last year, too. 

I applied for unemployment. Unfortunately, I needed another 3 weeks working to qualify. Even more unfortunately, my application flagged something in their system and they're now investigating my past claim for ""overpayment"" to the tune of 10k. 10k I don't have because I don't have a job, and how do I even start looking when I know I'm facing major surgery next month?

I'm VLC with my narcissist mother, I have been for years... I'd be NC except that I technically own the house she lives in. My younger sister (NC for 25 years) somehow got power of attorney and has drained my mother's bank account. Mommy dearest expects me to ""fix it"" for her, but refuses to call the police or press charges because it would ""damage their relationship"".

It feels like I just keep getting kicked in the teeth. And I say that holding a McDonald's bag and a Dunkin coffee, in my warm bed and safe house, knowing I am better off than a lot of people right now... which just somehow makes it worse?

I just want everything to stop for a moment, just a day or two. Let me breathe, please. Let me stand up and maybe don't knock me down so hard again this time...",1,1733410221.0,self,0,1.0,False

I have an old on-again-off-again AP that lives close by. We are, by both our admissions, terrible for each other. We‚Äôre just too different. 

The holidays, being around family so much, I‚Äôm sure a lot of you here can relate to how tough that is and all the messed up emotions this time of year dredges up. Thanksgiving night, I was feeling particularly sentimental (and a little drunk), and sent her a message. Just a simple, ‚ÄúHappy Thanksgiving, hope you had a great day.‚Äù The next morning, I had regrets, but she didn‚Äôt respond, so I figured that was for the best. 

Until Saturday morning. She responded, asked how I was, we got to talking back and forth, did some reminiscing about the good old days, we decided to meet for a coffee, and the next thing I know she‚Äôs riding me in the back of my SUV. I knew it was going to happen, but had convinced myself that it wouldn‚Äôt, and honestly was thinking with my dick more than anything. I know, I‚Äôm weak, and an idiot, but I was feeling lonely and empty and pining for‚Ä¶something. 

This morning, she sent me a message:
‚ÄúSo does this mean we‚Äôre back together?‚Äù

I do not want that, and I thought I had made that clear. I had said explicitly I didn‚Äôt want to go back with her. 

It‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs joking, but I don‚Äôt want to act like she is in case she‚Äôs not. I‚Äôll have to be as gentle as possible when I let her down. There is no way for me to not look like an asshole, which is fair, because I acted like one. Made my bed, now I have to lie in it.

I decided to become a rider because I had no money or agency in my life. I lived in those suburban enclaves of Atlanta with their pretty trees that tower into the sky and the many cows that are black and blue. Many say that this is not Atlanta and more so Georgia, but I have always been able to see Atlanta and it‚Äôs buildings‚Äî it‚Äôs skyscrapers poke through the dense forest that surrounds the city. I saw these things and wondered what it would be like to live in Atlanta‚Äî to fall in love. 

There was a bluejay who knew many things and it was with this bluejay whom I would go and consult with regarding this venture of mine. He was a plump bird with sparkling blue plumage and from time to time I would go to him and ask him questions. The bluejay would explain to me that the universe is calibrated perfectly to a number and it‚Äôs an elusive number with no beginning and no end. 

I could probably find him in The Burning Forest‚Äî beyond the golden wheat field. The time was 7 A.M and I felt bones creaking in my bed as I thought about all of this. I saw that on top of me there was a man who was 19 and he was gyrating his pelvis like a washing machine. I knew him well and at the most opportune moment‚Äî the pinnacle where I felt he would come to wherever he was going‚Äî I would shift myself forward and lift him upwards with both my hands. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna cum. I‚Äôm gonna cum.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äî not yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause I said so.‚Äù 

His light brown face was wet and sweat slid down the nape of his neck. He was flushed so red as he rocked my bed and his hair stuck to his face. It was a peculiar hair style‚Äî very long on the sides with short bangs on the front‚Äî just like a Beatle. We saw the morning sun through my windows and it‚Äôs pink glow drifted over the golden wheat field. A single bluejay flew towards The Burning Forest and far away you saw the distant visage of Atlanta.

He could not take it much longer. Despite his attempts to fight it, he began to lean backwards, so as to get it. That‚Äôs what it was to him. It.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get it. I‚Äôm gonna get it.‚Äù  I felt ashamed for what I had done to him. He was just 19 years old. Hadn‚Äôt been with man or woman. I pulled myself forward and decided to pull him off me because I regretted all of it. 

‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt like it when I cum, but I think I might have to. I think I might have to. I‚Äôve been trying to hold it back.‚Äù I did not like seeing that sort of thing and much less having any of it on me. 

‚ÄúWait, wait, wait. What are you doing?‚Äù 

I moved him to the side and stood from my bed. His body contorted and twitched in exasperation, but he had gotten nothing and would get nothing. I went to sit in front of an extremely large canvas that was very blue and I thought of this bluejay and I thought of Atlanta. These plans of mine had been gestating for a while because I had seen the riders. They always wore pink polos and were fastidious with the way they dressed. They traversed upon the Earth in great distances and there existed no place that the riders had not seen. 

The black coffee that appeared next to me was from the 19 year old man and he knew to bring it to me, even though I had not asked him. I was particularly swayed by those sorts of things, but I said nothing. I took a look at him and saw that he was fully dressed, so I went to go put my jeans on. He would go to Georgia Gwinnett College for a morning class and return at around 7 PM. 

‚ÄúI just wanted to apologize. I didn‚Äôt want it to come to this.‚Äù His voice was meandering, so he paused and stumbled through the words. I heard him behind me as I searched for my stained jeans. 

‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äî you‚Äôre fine‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre fine. It was totally me. Things just spiraled out of control.‚Äù The jeans were wedged in the back of the broken bed frame. I pulled them out slowly.

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, it did‚Äî but it was really me. After what you told me, I just‚Äî I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôve been right. I think I‚Äôm gonna cry.‚Äù He raised his hand to his mouth and fanned his eyes. His voice faltered as he spoke and it began to crack. 

I came to him and held him close‚Äî so horrified by what I had done. The coffee was scalding hot and it sat behind us‚Äî cigarette smoke in the cold air of his apartment. I had told him that I couldn‚Äôt see him anymore. That I would be gone for a little while. His face refused to accept the finality of my decision and he had laughed‚Äî thinking it all to be a big joke. The riders were crazy to him and when he saw that I was serious‚Äî he screamed at me. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. He spat those words at me. 

‚ÄúI think if this is what you want to do‚Äî I think‚Ä¶ I think you should really see if this is what you want to do. Like really see.‚Äù He put the tips of his fingers together and pointed them. 

‚ÄúThe thing is Willy‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to keep you. Are you late for class or something?‚Äù My hand was involuntarily wrapped around his waist. I tore it away. 

‚ÄúNo, I have time. My class doesn‚Äôt start until 11.‚Äù He made his morning tea. I continued to apply more light blue paint and began to outline a dense black figure in a sitting position on the right side of the canvas. The riders are said to be densely black in color. The legend goes that these riders mastered their job to such a degree that they could disappear into the blackness of the night. They could take you anywhere in minutes. 

I got my coffee and went to sit with him, continuing where I left off. 

‚ÄúThe thing is Willy‚Ä¶ is that I need to find a way to let all of this go‚Äî the art‚Ä¶ this desire to become famous. It‚Äôs really just destroying me.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt sit down and just hovered around him. I drank the coffee and didn‚Äôt stop drinking it. As soon as he left, I would make my way to The Burning Forest.

‚ÄúBut, it‚Äôs not really that. It‚Äôs not that. You wanting to be famous is what‚Äôs destroying you‚Äî not this other thing‚Ä¶ this need to let go‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all bullshit.‚Äù He took a small sip from the earl grey tea and looked straight ahead‚Äî towards the open window. The morning light was splendid on his face and a bouquet of summer lilies, daisies, and pink chrysanthemums stood next to him in a big vase. He set his tea down next to this vase and I set my empty cup next to his. 

Willy didn‚Äôt know that the riders were these sorts of people and I never floated that idea to him. To be completely honest, I liked the legends, but I didn‚Äôt believe that the world worked that way. I did believe in love and I believed that Willy and I would live happily ever after, but the world doesn‚Äôt work that way. Willy began to stand and broke away from my attempts to kiss him. His face clenched together when I got close to him and he jerked away. He left for his class at Georgia Gwinnett College and left his tea still very hot. 

The rider that was there in front of the dirt road of my home was statuesque. His curly hair was Greek and his shoulders were curved like the bow of an archer. The clothes on his body were the characteristic uniform of the riders: a light pink polo, blue denim, and a peculiar pair of men‚Äôs evening slippers that I could never quite place. Willy got into the open door and drove away. ",4,1733408183.0,rs_x,3,0.83,False
