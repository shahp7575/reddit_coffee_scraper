I‚Äôm 4 months postpartum, and matagal na talaga since last date namin ni hubby, yung kaming dalawa lang. So nung may bagong place na nag-open malapit sa amin, agad kong sinabi sa kanya na gusto ko talagang pumunta doon for a date that night (it was a friday).

Pag-uwi niya, parang wala lang. Hindi man lang nag-react or nagplano. I let it go at first, pero as days passed, parang naiinis ako kasi feeling ko wala lang sa kanya. When i asked him, sabi niya umuulan daw that time and di raw pwede iwan si baby. Pero may nanny naman kami, and for that night lang naman sana. So araw-araw ko sinasabi na gusto ko talaga lumabas kaming dalawa.

Finally, nung Friday, sabi niya lalabas na kami. So to describe the place, parang chill camping area. may mga food stalls, barbecue, may coffee shop din, at may live band pa. Sobrang gusto ko talaga yung ganung vibe, yung tipong chill lang while listening to live music, nagkakape and kwentuhan kasi nasabi ko na rin yun sa kanya before.

Pero when we got there, di kami nakapagdala ng camping chairs, so sa coffee shop na lang kami umupo. Medyo malayo pa sa live band area, so hindi ko rin masyadong naramdaman yung vibe na gusto ko sana. Tapos the whole time, halos nasa phone lang siya. After kumain, umalis na kami agad.

So... yeah, parang ang feeling ko tuloy, ginawa lang niya yun para masabi lang na ‚Äúayan, lumabas na tayo.‚Äù Hindi ko naramdaman yung effort or excitement like before. I ended up feeling really disappointed kasi gusto ko lang naman ng genuine time together, kahit simple lang.

So‚Ä¶ OA lang ba ako for feeling this way, or valid naman?",1,1760143393.0,OALangBaAko,1,1.0,False

1o3huoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1o3huoh/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1760142930.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

Moving on.. My 16 gr. shot gets to 32 gr. in 25 sec. (including 8 sec. pre-infusion).

Coffee looks good, nice crema on top but it is clearly bitter. My YT/Reddit research tells me, I need to grind coarser but that‚Äôll reduce the shot duration and I‚Äôm already at min. recommended time of 25 sec.

Okay this has been an insane journey. I had Klebsiella bacterial UTI for four months. I finally got the right antibiotics (5 days IV Rocephen) and the PAIN went away. But I have struggled for 6 years with a sense of urgency. It never bothered me until the UTI. I always just chalked it up to having a small bladder. Check my post history for more information. 

I went to a certified and trained Myofascial Release Pelvic Floor Physical Therapist. So she was a doctorate level PT but specifically trained in the John Barnes Myofascial Release technique. She was a GODSEND. She said I have scar tissue all along the inside of my vaginal walls. She could feel where my bladder sat and felt ridges of scar tissue on it. The whole time, I felt like I had to pee. After she did 30 mins of inside manual manipulation, the urgency feeling immediately left. I no longer felt like I had to pee!!! She also put a $4,000 dentist‚Äôs red light inside of me (covered with a condom) and did a 360 with it. I have not had children or experienced sexual assault, but I am sexually active and do enjoy rough sex. 

I had an instantaneous healing!! She released years of trauma on my vaginal walls and showed me how to manually do it myself. There‚Äôs a tool called the Intimate Rose wand on Amazon that I just ordered to use in the shower in case I have a flare up/ healing crisis. 

She assured me she treats this all the time. Just her telling me this gave me hope!! I am located in SC. She literally gave me my quality of life back. 

I also did an experiment and coffee really is irritating for my bladder- I went 4 days without it and slowly tried again. I learned I can have a SIP of an espresso max. I just need a little something!! 

Please DM me if you would like her contact information. She can do men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs internal work. I am so grateful!!!!! I think about yall on this sub all the time. Anxiety is another huge piece of this puzzle. You have to acknowledge your anxiety and work on it and also BELIEVE your body is capable of healing. After 4 months, my bladder feels 99% better and I have completely forgotten what that urgency feeling feels like. ‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèª",2,1760142316.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

I have been looking at guides on how to dial in coffee shots and following the guides but my espresso tastes sour (sour first note). 

I am using the double shot non pressurised basket that is provided from the machine, 18 gr of coffee and my extraction time is ~25 seconds from when I pressed the button, the first drop is around 11 seconds, yield was 40 gr of espresso (stopped at ~32 gr, and 8 more gr comes out). From what I read, people seems to say sour espresso is likely due to the coffee not fine enough, but if I made my coffee any finer (1 step finer), then the machine only extracted 10 gr over 1 minute then it stops pumping, so I am not sure what to do. I made the internal burr at 4 compared to 6 thats the default setting and dial on the side is at 4 currently (at 3 is when its over extracted)

The beans were roasted around 4 weeks ago (it was from a supermarket), and they recommended 1:2 ratio in their website for the specific blend.

I used to be quite an 4 season hiker, but I haven't been out in a while, since the time my canine hiking partner has advanced in age. so basically I got out of shape and haven't been going anywhere lately.

I don't drink, don't smoke, and don't engage in recreational use of mood altering substances. well, except for coffee. I am bothered by second-hand smoke.

I'm socially awkward, and altogether quite a ways from any kind of normal. I also find myself at a new low point in my life.

I'm afraid I've never had much interest in computer games, anime, or comic books. also not a sports fan.

you... over 30, not a pot-head, with some ability to use punctuation and common sense, not woke, and must not dislike dogs. preferably a guy.

I am hoping to find a friend, not an anonymous internet texting partner. I'm from the generation X. I'm not much of a writer.

I was genuinely really scared and put off starting for a few days. 

So I wanted to share that I haven't had any significant issues. I'm on day 6 of 7 with Omeprazole, Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin.  

I did lots of reading of this site and have followed this regimen in case it helps anyone.

7.30am - Omeprazole,
8.00am - Amoxicillin 2 tablets,
10.00am - Clarithromycin 1 tablet,

1pm probiotic yogurt with lunch

7.30pm - Omeprazole,
8.00pm - Amoxicillin 2 tablets,
10.00pm - Clarithromycin 1 tablet,

I've taken the antibiotics with food, I've also stuck to bland food, no coffee, and drunk 2 litres of water each day. 

Side effects I have had:
- Metallic taste in mouth 
- Some brief feelings of dizziness, spaced out and anxious but they soon passed 
- Abdominal cramps on two evenings (similar to period pain)
- Incredibly vivid dreams

I've been at work and been for a short walk every evening.

The symptoms I had, really for the last 3 years when I look back, were:

- Burping all the time
- Feeling full quicker than I used to
- Pressure and a sense of air rising in my throat
- Heartburn often in the morning

Recently he went off to college around a month ago and is going to college on the other side of the country. He will be home for Christmas break but I miss him a lot.

I met his parents pretty early on in our relationship. And we became official soon after. He has two brothers, one of whom is in high school with me. 

Over the summer I was at his house pretty much every day, so I saw and interacted with his parents. I‚Äôve gotten invited to dinner with them twice, which both times I‚Äôve gone to. I went on a trip with my boyfriend and them. 

I know they like me, his mom always wants me to chat with her and takes every opportunity to do so lol. The day he left she made me an iced tea and told me I could come over anytime üò≠. 
 
Even though my boyfriend has reassured me that his family loves me I still feel awkward asking his mom if she wants to get coffee with me after work sometime. Like idk if I‚Äôm overstepping or not.

Interesting industry tidbits and gossip.,"Gleneagles / Gleneagles Townhouse / Estelle Manor - teasing potential other Manor locations in the future. Have already opened a few members club in London. I'm pushing them to open more locations in Scotland - in areas more remote. Stay tuned.

Corinthia London - to remember, everything deluxe jr suite + will be renovated. Also that's where the separation of living area and bedroom start too. We can always bump you into this at booking if space is available.

Terranea Resort - so a friend from BHH has moved here and I was like WHAAAA. They are making a push to be luxury as they are a little tired of their rep of great views, but meh service. They have a new GM with a ton of luxury experience as well as a dedicated staff position now who's goal is to get them to become Forbes 5 star. Since I probably won't be there anytime soon, I've asked them if they wanted some fattie guinea pigs to stay (not free but you'll get *very* VIPed) and report back especially about service. LMK if interested.

Black Desert Resort - This is a huge resort by St George which is banking on people wanting to spend more time around national parks, golf a lot, but don't have the budget for Amangiri but also don't want to stay somewhere meh. They're wanting the guests who would normally just go in and out of Zion quickly to spend a couple extra days to relax. Don't know yet how it will do. Might be a hit. Might be a bust. It has to fill a lot of rooms... and I'm more wary at the lack of Intl travelers to the parks. Will keep on radar.

LHW - was told to me had the best line of the conference. They told everyone else they had a chance to win the LAN champion since I had to be taken out of the next running due to winning too many prizes already. Remember even with your fancy new LHW membership status from AMEX, you can still include a TA to handle the LHW member rates for you. Get VIPed both ways.

Acqualina - had a chat with how this past summer was a bit rougher around the edges than usual for service and ongoing complaints about other resort guests. This was simply due to the normally more american crowd becoming quite diverse for FIFA world cup and noise/excitement levels should become normalized once again.

Orient Express Trains and Hotels - I'm meh on trains but more interested in their new sailing yacht coming out next year. More so because it has very short sailings with even 2 night stints. I think this will capture the younger crowd a bit more. Will be watching this.

Sugar Beach - Spice of life, owners villa is on the market, 9 bedrooms, super private. Off-season starts around 35k AI which split amongst 9 set of friends isn't all too bad. As large celebratory friend trips gets more popular (normally see this everytime BTC gets a spike up), will see what % this will be occupied. Already taken for Festive at a large premium.

Grand Hyatt Deer Valley - This is where conference was hosted. Right now the hotel either faces the FS construction or the highway. If you can't sleep with a sound machine, def avoid those rooms. I've been told by friends who stayed last ski season that the snow will make it less loud - but I don't know. As someone sensitive, I'd still pick the construction view. Make sure all the rooms in a residence has a window if you care about that... my 3rd bedroom was windowless which makes it easier for noise and lights - maybe great for kids? Otherwise, I think its good value for $ to get to ski in DV vs something like a St R. Probably good to burn points too (caveat, haven't looked myself so don't take my word on it.)

Park Hyatt Beaver Creek - finally a room makeover. More soft goods in the bedroom but the bathrooms finally getting complete overhaul. Only thing to note is that there won't be any tubs except in suites or above. But who can beat this location in BC?

Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedegral - Hotel was closed and just reopened post full renovations. All the rooms got redone and the beachfront suites even had some walls blown out to make it larger. Point valuations have become harder and harder to redeem as they make it more and more expensive to use. Will this be what the hotel needs to get fatties to love it? Again, I probably won't be there anytime soon to stay but same offer as Terranea stands in case you want to be our fattravel reviewer for this?

Quark - I finally got to the bottom of why the Aquamarine (their nicest boat) isn't combinable with the fly the drake... it's because having three of those planes (what they would need to fill the number of people in the Aquamarine) would be a logistical nightmare vs the two they use + the helicopters are always needing parts and maintenance (that's a good thing) on shore - so in and out of Ushuaia the boat needs to go.

Lodge at Blue Sky - Brought rates down about 20% across the board to make it more inline with competitors. For those that loved it, take a look again now. For those who couldn't afford it before, take a look again. My friend, Kate there, missed their budget by like 0.6% for fall so let's help her hit for Q4?

Stanly Ranch - I call my turnaround wonderchild. Yes, have a friend who moved here but it was the GM who has been leading the turnaround. Do we all remember when Wildflower had a disastrous opening? Tom Donovan swooped in and helped it operationally and now it's packed! He's doing the same at Stanly now and the review I've been getting back are stellar. If you had a bad stay there before, or if you've been turned off by bad reviews, do give this one another chance now.

Nukutepipi - anyone up for a 21 bedroom buyout in the French Polynesia? 900K euros for the week. Trying to decide if I'll have enough demand for this before committing to a trip out in Jan to check it out.

Andronis - really trying to make a push to be the premiere brand in Greece pushing for Canaves' spot = more VIP treatment for you since they're trying to make a splash in the market.

St Regis Deer Valley - finally will have some larger 5 BR residences in Snowpark vs out in Deer Crest and 4 BRs in the main building. They will be live for this ski season.

The Ranch - trying to lose the celebrity fat camp title. They've even added coffee and fish/poultry as protein due to demand. Hudson Valley is still going to be the more flexible option vs Malibu with shorter stays etc. Revamp has been well received.

The Palms/Shore Club - They have some festive pockets where they can do some shorter stays over Xmas/NYE which is rare for Turks and Caicos. Also their junior suites are very reasonable in the low 1ks too so lmk if you're still looking for something. For example, one jr suite open at the palms Dec 23- 27.

Rosewood - New branding is out... will do a full post on this as I still owe a recap from the Kindred event. But what do you guys think?

Oetker - Remember the great review u/RickyMEME wrote re: Lanesborough. Those are the things that had Sameer win the Above and Beyond award. He says hi btw. But maybe if everyone here hates on Du Cap so much, maybe we don't need to get the team there to do a teach in on demystifying the hotel? TBD.

Reschio - Another one that has a rep of too cool for school. The pre-arrivals are hard but once you're there, you're in a fairy tale is normally how to describe it. But they've actually finally really targeting US sales with not one but more hires. So this family run business is turning around in how to handle (American) clientele but watch - when hotels do this, pricing generally goes up. So get those bookings in now IMO.

Montage - expected hotel footprint to double over the next few years. We know of a few... I know of a few more.. and a number are still top level secret. The biggest growth though will be in the Pendry brand vs the Montage brand.

Slovenia - 3/5 hotels. 10/5 people. For anyone looking to go in before it becomes more commercialized and luxury - it might be the time.

COMO - was only into owning their own hotels as a family owned brand. How Como Parrot Cay happened was when the daughter was really into fishing and saw the island and told mom about it! But now it's been asked to consult and manage etc especially from the sustainability aspect of it - hence Laucala. Laucala will be closing next year for a full renovation with a strong focus in how to make it more sustainable. Stay tuned in this brand space to see what else is coming on board with more management deals.

FS Yacht - we're the number one sellers in North America.... and number 2 in the world - only about 400K US$ behind the top agency which sits in Asia. Anyone want to help me claim 1? Still fiddling re: Fattie group. Was really hoping to do it in Caribbean (selfishly easier travel for me) but held off due to the delay. LMK if interest in this.

O&O Moonlight - probably the most anticipated North America opening this year? We'll be on the ground there in Dec with our thoughts but feedback on site (hotel not yet open) is that the space is STUNNING. They also have staff housing for 300 that will hopefully alleviate the staffing concerns but who knows. We all know mountain towns are hard.

Eau Palm Beach - Larry Ellison bought this in 2024 and supposedly is going to pour $ into it. I mean, Sensei is amazing because he doesn't really care about it making $ (kind of). But he has a lot of $$ he can put towards just having it be exactly what he wants. This is another one to watch.

This is a small snapshot of people my team and I met up with - it's just what I found interesting to share. We won a bunch of awards, u/codigofar is the rising star. My team had the top overall team. I won top overall advisor whether in a team or individual. My friend, Kristen Nix won top individual advisor not on a team. A bunch of my hotel friends won awards on their end. But what was most important were the  closing down speakeasies (very easy to do in Utah) and the afterparties in my suite. These are where the relationships are made. And where the best gossip is found.. which leaves me to

I see the skyline of Chicago crumbling under its own smoke, the color of blood diluted in rust and ash. The sun hasn‚Äôt looked right since the war, and maybe that‚Äôs why they picked me‚Äîsomeone who had nothing left worth losing. The year was 2062 when the world finally admitted it was dying. Maybe we all knew before that, but humans are experts at pretending the ground isn‚Äôt splitting beneath their feet.

I‚Äôm an astronautical engineer by training, but out here, titles are just words that lost their gravity. My name‚Äôs Ethan Hale. Forty-three years old. Father of one. Widower, though that word doesn‚Äôt mean much anymore when most of the world has been widowed by fire and fallout. My wife, Lydia, was gone long before the war. Cancer. My daughter, Emma‚Äîshe made it to eight. That was before the air outside our city got so thick with radiation that her little lungs started to shut down. I remember sitting by her bed, the monitors stuttering with each fading breath, her skin pale as moonlight. That was when I decided I‚Äôd go if they asked. I‚Äôd go anywhere the air was clean. I‚Äôd find a world she could have lived on, even if I‚Äôd never see it myself.

There are six of us on the¬†*Horizon*. Six remnants of what humanity used to be. We were sent up a year ago‚Äîif time still means what it used to. Days blur together when you‚Äôre counting oxygen instead of hours. We were supposed to find something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat could sustain life. But most of space is quiet, and quiet is dangerous. You start to hear your own thoughts echo too loud in your skull.

I share a small module with Jensen, our mission pilot. He‚Äôs the egotistical one, if you ask anyone who‚Äôs been stuck with him longer than a meal cycle. Always talking about how he ‚Äúcould‚Äôve led this mission better‚Äù or how ‚Äúcommand doesn‚Äôt understand real flight dynamics.‚Äù He‚Äôs brilliant, sure‚Äîace pilot, top of his training class‚Äîbut he‚Äôs the kind of man who can‚Äôt stand silence unless it‚Äôs filled with his own voice. He shaved his head before we launched, said he didn‚Äôt want ‚Äústray hairs in zero-g.‚Äù I think he just liked seeing his reflection on the metal panels‚Äîclean, flawless, untouchable.

Then there‚Äôs Varga. Big man. Burn scars up his neck and across half his jaw. He never talks about how he got them, and none of us ask. You can tell it‚Äôs something to do with the war, though‚Äîhe‚Äôs got that look in his eyes, like he‚Äôs already been to hell and didn‚Äôt find it impressive. He handles the maintenance work, the grunt labor, things that make the rest of us flinch. He doesn‚Äôt flinch at anything. Once, during a decompression drill, a hatch door slammed shut on his arm. He didn‚Äôt make a sound. Just waited until I pried it open and muttered, ‚ÄúStill works.‚Äù That was Varga in three words.

Our scientist‚ÄîDr. Mei Lin‚Äîkeeps to herself. The smart one. If there‚Äôs anything worth knowing about a planet‚Äôs atmosphere, soil, or water, she knows it before the sensors do. Mei‚Äôs not unkind, but she‚Äôs not built for small talk either. Her voice is calm, even when things go wrong. Especially when they go wrong. I‚Äôve caught her humming sometimes, quietly, when she runs diagnostics. Some old Mandarin tune. It makes the lab feel less like a coffin.

The yapper‚Äôs name is Suarez. Youngest of the crew‚Äîtwenty-six, I think. Talks enough for all of us combined. He used to be a communications officer in the Brazilian navy before the collapse, but he talks like someone who‚Äôs never been heard in his life. He keeps asking if I think we‚Äôll ever go home. I never know how to answer him. Not because I don‚Äôt want to, but because ‚Äúhome‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a place anymore.

And then there‚Äôs Fischer‚Äîthe joker. German, or maybe Austrian. He tells jokes that would get him punched back on Earth, if Earth still had bars and beer and laughter to spare. Once told Mei that if we crash-landed, he‚Äôd ‚Äúgladly repopulate humanity‚Äù with her. She didn‚Äôt even look up from her data pad, just said, ‚ÄúStatistically improbable,‚Äù and kept typing. I laughed harder than I should have. You start to crave any sound that isn‚Äôt mechanical hum or your own heartbeat.

We left Earth under a sky that looked bruised. The launch was chaotic, improvised. Half our equipment was secondhand military tech, the rest scavenged from old NASA reserves. There was no glory in it. No waving flags. Just a final, desperate reach for something that wasn‚Äôt dying. Command didn‚Äôt even call it a colonization mission anymore‚Äîthey called it ‚ÄúResource Continuity Exploration.‚Äù As if finding a rock with breathable air could erase the taste of radiation and guilt.

The first few months were simple enough. We were still pretending this was noble. We‚Äôd wake up, check systems, run scans, make coffee that tasted like battery acid. We laughed sometimes. We played cards in zero gravity. Suarez taught us a stupid song from his childhood, and for a few days, it almost felt human again. Then the boredom crept in‚Äîthe silence, the sameness. When you spend long enough staring into black, the black starts to stare back.

I keep Emma‚Äôs photo in my chest pocket. Always. It‚Äôs wrinkled, edges curled, the ink faded from the recycled air. Her hair‚Äôs in pigtails, her smile gap-toothed, the sky behind her a blue that doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Sometimes, I talk to it. Not out loud. Just in my head. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still looking, kiddo,‚Äù I tell her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find it.‚Äù I don‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm starting to think there‚Äôs nothing out here worth finding.

We‚Äôre three days into orbit around a moon that doesn‚Äôt appear on any known star chart. No atmosphere, or so we thought. But our sensors have been glitching. Oxygen spikes. Temperature inconsistencies. Mei says it‚Äôs impossible. Varga says impossible doesn‚Äôt mean shit in space. Jensen thinks it‚Äôs a system error. Fischer says maybe it‚Äôs ghosts. Suarez just wants to go home.

The moon hung there, a gray coin against a black sea. It wasn‚Äôt much to look at‚Äîpitted, dry, inert. But I found myself staring anyway. Maybe it was the stillness that drew me in. After a year of constant movement‚Äîfans humming, systems cycling, air filters sighing‚Äîthe idea of something so perfectly motionless felt almost holy.

I sat in the observation module long after the others had drifted to their quarters. The hum of the station was softer here. A few indicator lights pulsed gently, the color of dying embers. I could hear the slow rhythmic pop of the thermal panels adjusting to temperature shifts, metal expanding, contracting. It almost sounded like breathing. I pretended it was Earth, still alive, still trying.

The viewport glass was smudged from fingerprints. Mine, probably. We don‚Äôt get new cleaning cloths until resupply, and resupply hasn‚Äôt been a word that means anything in months. I stared at my own reflection until it blurred into the cratered surface beyond. The moonlight, faint as it was, carved out the lines on my face, made the gray in my beard look silver. I looked older than forty-three. Out here, we all do.

I used to tell Emma that space wasn‚Äôt empty‚Äîit was waiting. Waiting for someone brave enough to wake it up. She believed me, back when bedtime stories still meant something. Now, I‚Äôm not sure if I was lying to her or to myself.

Behind me, the air recycler clicked off and restarted, a soft mechanical cough that reminded me we were only alive because of moving parts. Everything here hums or whirs or vibrates‚Äîtiny reminders that silence means death. Even our sleep is noisy.

I heard footsteps. Jensen again, by the sound of it‚Äîhe walks like the ship belongs to him.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still staring at that rock?‚Äù he said. His voice always carries an undertone of amusement, even when he‚Äôs dead serious.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt sleep,‚Äù I said without turning.

‚ÄúYeah, none of us can. That‚Äôs what happens when you circle nothing for too long.‚Äù He came closer, hands folded behind his back like some kind of commander in a propaganda film. ‚ÄúYou know, Earth Command probably forgot about us months ago. We could be floating here for years and they‚Äôd never send retrieval.‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt make much difference,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNothing left to go back to.‚Äù

He made a noise somewhere between a laugh and a snort. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs the point. No home to return to means no reason to stop searching. Efficient, if you think about it.‚Äù

That was Jensen‚Äôs gift‚Äîturning despair into logistics.

After he left, I stayed seated. I could still smell his aftershave‚Äîsynthetic citrus, rationed and bitter. It didn‚Äôt cover the scent of recycled air. Nothing does.

Later, Varga came through for his shift check. He nodded to me once, didn‚Äôt ask why I was there. He doesn‚Äôt ask questions unless they need answers. His hands were wrapped in the same bandages he‚Äôs been reusing for months, smudged with grease and disinfectant. He moved like a man whose bones remembered gravity.

‚ÄúSystem check?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúAll green,‚Äù he said. His voice was deep, the kind that could fill a hangar without trying. He looked out the viewport for a long time, his reflection cutting against mine. ‚ÄúUgly thing,‚Äù he said finally.

‚ÄúWhat, the moon?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúEverything looks ugly when it‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

That was the longest conversation we‚Äôd had in weeks.

When he left, I pulled the photo from my pocket. Emma‚Äôs smile caught the light, the edges of her curls illuminated by a sun that probably doesn‚Äôt reach Earth anymore. I traced the curve of her cheek with my thumb, trying to remember what her laughter sounded like without the rasp in her lungs. It‚Äôs strange, the things you forget first. You‚Äôd think it would be her face, but no. The mind keeps the image. It‚Äôs the sound that fades.

Sometimes, I think that‚Äôs what the universe is‚Äîa giant silence, collecting all the sounds we‚Äôve lost.

Mei Lin joined me just before the next rotation cycle. She moves quietly, like she‚Äôs afraid to disturb the air. She handed me a cup of water‚Äîreal water, not the flavored reconstitution mix we usually ration. ‚ÄúYou should rest,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll burn out.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlready did,‚Äù I said, but softly enough that I wasn‚Äôt sure if she heard.

She sat beside me for a while, not saying anything. Her gaze was fixed on the lunar surface. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something peaceful about it,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúUncomplicated. No politics, no borders. Just rock.‚Äù

‚ÄúRock‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got left,‚Äù I said.

She smiled faintly. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs not such a bad thing.‚Äù

I wanted to tell her she was wrong‚Äîthat it was a terrible thing, that peace without life isn‚Äôt peace at all. But I didn‚Äôt. I just watched the way her reflection lingered against the glass, her face overlapping the moon‚Äôs shadowed horizon until it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began.

Hours passed. I don‚Äôt know how many. The artificial lighting in the module dimmed automatically to simulate night, but it never feels like night when the stars are always awake. Suarez‚Äôs voice echoed faintly through the corridor somewhere behind me, rapid Spanish mixed with laughter. Probably talking to Fischer. Their friendship had turned into a kind of survival mechanism‚Äînoise warding off the dark.

I envied them.

The moon didn‚Äôt move. Or maybe it did, and I just didn‚Äôt notice anymore. It had that kind of gravity‚Äîthe quiet kind that pulls your thoughts inward until you forget to breathe. Its craters looked deeper the longer I stared, like wells that had swallowed all their light.

I wondered how many men before me had stared at something like that and felt the same thing‚Äîthe slow erosion of meaning, the gentle ache of knowing you‚Äôre both too small and too far gone to matter.

Somewhere deep in the ship, a relay clicked, and the hum of the recyclers dipped for a second. The sudden near-silence startled me more than any alarm could have. Then it resumed, steady as a heartbeat.

Everything was fine. The systems were fine. The crew was fine.

I told myself that a dozen times before I finally stood and turned away from the window.

Before I left, I looked one more time‚Äîjust one long look at that pale, pitted sphere hanging out there in the void. It looked back the same way it always did. Empty. Still. Unmoved.

But I stayed just long enough to memorize every shadow, every ridge, every faint scar of light. Because when you‚Äôve stared at something long enough, you start to know it like your own face.

So, to keep it brief (I could really write an autobiography at this rate on my time in the army), I want to see if the grass is really greener on the other side. I find the army to be quite boring, I was going to have a career change as an officer within the army but sadly the officer assigned to be my AOSB candidate mentor (?) was really easily distracted, I then tried to retrade but that all went to shit when the army out of the blue changed a lot of it's civilian qualification prerequisites (GCSE Science from a D to now a C, namely). Again, I am unable to fund getting another science GCSE, nor will my or any other unit allow me to have time off to obtain this, and now to make things even worse, I am now medically downgraded so I now well and truly, trapped in my job role.

I am currently studying a Level 3 CPC Transport manager's qualification and as soon as that's complete, I will be looking at doing another Level 3 qualification, likely in project engineering or management again. I have obtained Cat C and C+E driving qualifications, but I am horrendously bad at driving trucks (5 tests on both C and C+E).

Prior to me joining the army, I was working at a small Tesco as a trained Shift Leader and I did some Pearson EDI Level 3 IT qualifications in User Skills and PROCOM. I think ideally I'd like a job within the IT industry, but I'm open to anything as long as I can pay off my mortgage.

Those who were in, what would you recommend I should do? I genuinely believe that prolonging my career at this rate is unrealistic and is currently doing absolutely no favours for my mental health (of which, I am currently signed off work for at the time of writing). I genuinely go into work, sit there in a corner of an office drinking coffee and wonder about chatting shit to people. It's torturous.

Wrixet followed the Telkan in the fancy dress uniform into the office. The Telkan he'd met the day he'd suffered from severe psychic shock was sitting behind the desk, hands on top of the desk and folded, his eyes careful and calculating.

He sat down in the chair and for a moment he had a vision of the Telkan behind the desk drawing a pistol and shooting him between the eyes.

""Relax, Wrixet, I just have a few questions about Telkan,"" the other one said.

Wrixet's retinal link finally returned the information.

General Traxrek, First Telkan Field Army, TerraSol

Born: Telkan-2, Creche 761653, Feb - 24 Solarian Mean

Age: 75 - First Longevity Treatment

Not much else.

Not that it helped Wrixet.

""Before I ask any questions, do you have any?"" the General asked.

Wrixet shook his head. ""No, sir.""

The General waited a moment, then nodded. He tapped the top of his desk and Wrixet could see the spray of light that meant a hologram tuned so only the General could see it had popped up.

""You transport ship hit a shade patch, leaving only three survivors. The three survivors then banded together with a digital sentience aboard the non-orbital massive logistics base to attempt to restart the anti-shade protocols. While that was happening, the non-orbital massive logistics base was boarded by enemy units. During that time one Telkan was killed by enemy action but taken by the Crusade of Fire and Beauty and remade into a Warbound. After that, you found yourself with Captain Decken, who is currently advocating for a massive troop and ship moment to stop the Hellspace 'fence'. Did I miss anything?"" the General stated, his cadence slow and even, without guilt or accusation or judgement.

""No, sir,"" Wrixet said.

""Following that, what happened is less clear. Captain Decken was called up by the Iron Dominion Admiralty and I doubt he confided much in you about his plans,"" the General stated, then waited.

""He wants to take the fight to the Crumblies and the Bugs, sir,"" Wrixet said. ""I don't know why, it sounds crazy, but he says that the Bugs are our actual enemy. That the Crumblies, the Starfish, the Spaghetti Monsters, they're all tools of a bug the size of my boot sole.""

Wrixet shook his head. ""I don't know how that bug is our real enemy or why the bug made the Captain immediately stop everything to rush back here, but he's the Captain and he's never steered me wrong or done me wrong in the few months I've known him.""

The General nodded.

""Wrixet, I can transfer you to the Telkan Iron Dominion First Field Army and process your separation papers. I've talked to Senator Ba'ahnya'ahd and the Honorable Senator has agreed to give you political refugee status as well as protections if you wish to emigrate to the Hamburger Kingdom and reside in his district,"" the General said. 

""How did you manage that?"" Wrixet asked. ""I'm nobody. I've got no money, nobody at my back, no juice, no leverage. Why would a Senator care about me?""

""It was simple, I bribed him with an advance copy of Total Telkan Warfare VII - Iron Dominion Edition.""

Wrixet blinked. ""Bribed him?""

The General nodded. ""Indeed. Indeed. A long standing Hamburger Kingdom tradition, up there with handing out species specific pornography to supporters and stabbing the supporter of your rival,"" the General said. ""Senator Ba'ahnya'ahrd has exquisite tastes in bribes and understands the various tiers with impeccable natural instincts.""

The General leaned back, folding his hands over his stomach. ""Up here in the rarefied heights of Staff Officer, we have to do politicking as well as leadership,"" he nodded slowly. ""Right now, since you don't qualify for First Telkan Marine Expeditionary Force, Captain Decken has agreed to let my unit represent your interests.""

The General looked uncomfortable for a second, the expression gone so quickly that Wrixet wasn't even sure he had seen it.

""Private Imna stated that you had never been close to a Broodcarrier before,"" the General said.

""No, sir,"" Wrixet shook his head. ""Not even on public transport. Anyone where I lived had a broodcarrier, they didn't say anything and kept it close.""

""Is there some kind of shortage? Disease? Birth rate discrepancy?"" the General asked.

Wrixet shrugged. ""I don't know, sir.""

""The worship of the Digital Omnimessiah is no longer practiced?""

Wrixet shook his head. ""No. After the civil war, nobody would admit to it even if they did,"" he sighed and looked up. ""Saint Brentali'ik, Warfather Vuxten, were all just propaganda after the Precursor War. We went to one of the last church's when The Bag opened and woke up the Warbound, which were all hidden. We didn't really believe any of it had happened or any of those people existed.""

The General nodded. ""He was real. I never met him personally, but I did see him at a distance once or twice. I remember reading about him in the Corps newspaper,"" the General chuckled. ""I saw Brentili'ik more than once on the Tri-Vee and saw her signature more than once.""

Wrixet just nodded back, unsure of what to say.

""But it's been forty-thousand years for all of you and only fifty for us. Civilizations have risen and fallen in that time,"" he pointed at a map of the galactic arm. ""The only thing this has in common with the map from when The Bag closed is most of the stars are there.""

He shook his head. ""Of course the Mantid, Treana'ad, and Lankies are all there. Sure, they've changed a little, but not too much,"" he gave a small laugh. ""I have discovered, during my time on TerraSol, that my Lanaktallan counterparts are suspicious of things younger than the life of a star.""

""I never saw them too much,"" Wrixet said. He shook his head. ""That's not true. A lot of a stuffer shacks were run by Lanaktallan behind armaglass, overcharging for fizzers or alk. Saw some on TV for a competitive video game competition, but when I realized they were only two hundred hours into what they believed would be a three month competition I kind of tapped out and went back to watching the Gleeful Shrub Buddies.""

The General just nodded. ""Back to business. I've got several choices for you. If you want to stay with Captain Decken we'll move you to the *Nell of Night*'s Telkan Lancer team, transfer you to the Solarian Dominion,"" he smiled, a sharp toothed baring of teeth that had the unnatural regularity of someone with extensive dental work. ""That will keep you the safest. The Solarian Dominion is not in the habit of turning people over by threats or demands. I doubt Captain Decken is going to turn over one of his Lancers when, from what I hear, Dominion might give him permission to go after the Bugs as he sees fit.""

Wrixet was silent.

The General sighed. ""That means, son, I'm going to transfer you to the *Nell of Night* permanently. Don't get killed.""

Wrixet nodded. ""I can do that.""

""Any questions?"" the General asked.

Wrixet nodded. ""Just one. I'm not sure if I want to hear the answer though.""

""Shoot your shot, kid.""

Wrixet looked out the window. ""If I come back, if I survive the war..."" he let his words trail off for a long moment. ""Will you help me?""

The General nodded. ""When you come back, if I'm still alive, I'll do my best to get you acclimated to civilian life,"" he paused. ""Family life, with a wife and at least one broodcarrier.""

Wrixet was silent for a long moment. When he spoke it was barely above a whisper.

""I would like that.""

He was in a good mood.

He was a Pagrik, a species that he wasn't even sure existed any more. His home planet had been destroyed while enemies then unknown used hellspiking and gravitatic lensing to create a hellspace infused 'fence' across the galactic spur. 

Almost everyone else in his family had died.

But he refused to give in to the overwhelming depression.

He had saved his mother.

He had saved his sisters.

He had saved his nieces.

He had saved his nephews.

Yes, the Captain and the robots had helped, but it had been him.

He had made a difference then and he believed he could make a difference now.

There was another reason he was in a good mood.

He was on TerraSol. Home of the Mad Lemurs of Terra. Home of The Builders.

""Mister Hetmwit,"" a high ranking NCO said, nodding to him as they passed each other in the hallway.

*People saw him*.

Not only that, they *remembered he existed* when he wasn't in view.

Compared to his entire life before he had met Captain Decken, it was like every Terran knew where he was at all times.

The automatic door in front of him opened up as he approached and closed *after* he went through.

His ID was accepted first try.

He got his food on the first punch through on the context menus.

Hetmwit took that as a sign.

He was smiling, ears up, nose flared, mouth closed, eyebrows raised, when he moved up to the table and sat down across from Captain Decken.

""Good evening, Number One,"" Decken said after he swallowed his mouthful of food and took a drink from a glass.

""Mmph,"" Hetmwit answered, shoveling more food into his mouth.

Captain Decken pitched his voice in such a way that it sounded aggressive, like some kind of strange creature. ""Can't talk! Eating!"" then laughed as Hetmwit shoved another mouthful of noodles and beef and vegetables and sauce into his mouth. ""EATING!""

The Captain went back to his own plate as Hetmwit powered through his entire plate, then took the plate back to where one was supposed to drop it if they were so inclined, then got a refill on his fizzy. When he sat down he saw the Captain had a cup of kaff and was relaxing.

""How's your crew, Number One?"" Decken asked.

""The Robots are good. I coaxed them out of hiding with a Confederate Naval Forces Lancer Enlistment,"" Hetmwit said.

Decken shook his head. ""Spontaneous sentience isn't unheard of but it isn't exactly common either.""

""They passed their Hellspace contamination checks,"" Hetmwit said. He tapped the table. ""I had to fight with engineering and maintenance when they replaced the rewind drive. They wanted to purge our coordinate history too.""

Decken cocked his head wordlessly.

""I eventually got it through their heads that I'd rather we kept running with a damaged rewind drive than lose those coordinates,"" Hetmwit said. He laughed. ""Two hours later there were guys from Dominion Intelligence going over our rewind drive data.""

""Two front war, we have to figure out who to knock out first. The Spodders or the Mar-gite Coalition.""

Hetmwit nodded. ""Spodders have less territory and people. They've only got about twelve hundred settled star systems. The Mar-gite, well, common word on the street is they have the rest of the galaxy.""

""I've heard the same. They sent a few tough as nails admirals and generals to the Spodders. Command had it at 80% that the Spodders would betray us,"" Decken said. ""Detonating starships on the pads and attacking, even killing, diplomats, is pretty much a declaration of war.""

Hetmwit shook his head. ""I can't see how your people can just take that in kind. A betrayal like that would shock my people to the core. People would even be arguing whether or not that was a declaration of war, a legitimate attack, or some kind of show of force but not a declaration of war.""

""Meanwhile the Spodders snap off pieces of your species's homes,"" Decken said. He shrugged. ""We have a long history of dragons attempting to grab pearls. If its a show of force or a demonstration of strength or a declaration of war, it doesn't matter. It's how *we* view it.""

He sipped his coffee and set it down.

""As soon as the repairs are finished, the Admiralty will give us orders,"" Decken said. ""I wanted to tell you that they've sent a triple strength task force to your home systems to try to save what they can,"" he tapped the top of the table and the kaff refilled. ""Your star nation still has roughly fifteen systems as of this morning and it looks like our attack on the Hellspace station stopped or slowed the enemy.""

The Captain took a sip and stared over the rim of the cup.

Hetmwit breathed deep, knowing that the Captain was about to hit him with something rough.

""Your family arrived here two hours ago. They'll be through processing in an hour,"" Decken said. ""It'll take you thirty minutes to get to where they are by aircar. It will take you fifteen minutes to run down and get a taxi.""

Hetmwit stood up, his ears straight up in shock.

""You're officially on shore leave until further notice,"" Decken said.

Hetmwit saluted and as soon as Decken returned the salute he rushed out of the cafeteria.

Decken sipped at his coffee then looked at the cup.

""This is pretty good.""

All it takes is for them to decide to look through every shoe, every shirt, every THING, just to throw it on to the first surface they see.

Watching this happen obliterates any motivation to fix the section you just recovered because you just know that this will keep happening over and over again.

Not joking, literally 90% of my job is cleaning up after people. Cleaning up the used tissues they left on the shelves, the coffee cups they threw on the floor, the item they picked up just to put back down 20 feet later.

1o3gp6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1o3gp6z/leaves_of_november/,Leaves of November,"About Me:
Hey! I‚Äôm looking for a creative and detailed writing partner interested in slow-burn romance, character development, and immersive storytelling. I write in third-person, multi-paragraph style, and I‚Äôm hoping to find someone who loves tension, subtle emotional build-up, and characters with depth and flaws. My character is a rugged Marine stationed in New York ‚Äî tough on the outside, emotionally closed-off, but deeply human.

Prompt Setup:
üìç Staten Island, NYC ‚Äî Early November.

Cody  (M, 28), a battle-hardened Marine home on station for a few months, is used to noise, discipline, and distance. Life has been reduced to schedules, deployments, and moments of solitude that feel more like survival than peace.

One morning during his run, he stumbles across a second-grade teacher taking her class on a fall scavenger hunt. He wasn‚Äôt looking for a distraction ‚Äî especially not someone so warm, grounded, and full of life. But somehow, the way she talks to her students, the way she lights up when they discover a red oak leaf, lodges itself in his mind.

Their worlds couldn‚Äôt be more different ‚Äî she lives by lesson plans and laughter, while he‚Äôs haunted by things he never talks about. Still, week by week, they cross paths, text, grab coffee. A fling sparks ‚Äî unexpected and magnetic.

But when emotions creep in, Cody starts pulling away, falling back into old habits: bar hookups, detachment, pretending he doesn‚Äôt care. Only to realize what he‚Äôs been running from‚Ä¶ might be exactly what he‚Äôs been missing.

What I‚Äôm Looking For in a Partner:
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôd play the teacher (F) ‚Äî bright, emotionally intelligent, maybe a little guarded from her own past.
	‚Ä¢	You enjoy character-driven scenes, not just romance but real life moments ‚Äî field trips, quiet dinners, small fights, and even holiday events.
	‚Ä¢	Slow burn! This isn‚Äôt insta-love. Let‚Äôs build tension, hesitation, longing, and vulnerability over time.
	‚Ä¢	Bonus points if you love seasonal vibes (cozy fall aesthetics, snow-covered sidewalks, Christmas tree lots, classroom crafts, etc).

Potential Scenes/Ideas to Explore:
	‚Ä¢	Thanksgiving dinner invite: she wants him to come, but he flakes ‚Äî regret ensues
	‚Ä¢	A Christmas school event where he shows up last-minute to surprise her
	‚Ä¢	A snowstorm strands them together in a cabin or her apartment ‚Äî finally forcing a heart-to-heart
	‚Ä¢	He buys her a thoughtful Christmas gift that shows how much he‚Äôs been paying attention ‚Äî even if he can‚Äôt yet say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù

Other Info:
	‚Ä¢	21+ partners only please ‚Äî romance will include mature themes (emotionally and potentially physically)
	‚Ä¢	Third-person, multi-paragraph (no one-liners)
	‚Ä¢	Comfortable writing emotionally complex, flawed characters
	‚Ä¢	Flexible posting pace ‚Äî 2‚Äì4 replies a week ideal

1o3ggil,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o3ggil/th_miles_behind/,[TH] Miles Behind.,"The truck idled on the shoulder of the highway, its headlights spilling pale light onto the fog-wrapped asphalt.
Inside, John Mercer sat with both hands resting on the steering wheel, his knuckles pale, the leather cracked beneath his touch ‚Äî like his skin, like his life.

It was nearly 3 a.m. The radio hissed between dead channels, whispering fragments of country songs and preacher talk, but he wasn‚Äôt listening. The coffee in his thermos had gone cold hours ago. He didn‚Äôt care. He hadn‚Äôt cared about much in years.

He stared at the ribbon of road disappearing into the dark. He used to love that view ‚Äî the promise of distance, of freedom, of being no one and nowhere. But now it felt like a curse. Every mile marker was another reminder of everything he‚Äôd left behind.


---

He could still remember her laugh ‚Äî Mary. High school sweetheart. The kind of girl who made you want to settle down, buy a house, raise kids, grow old.
He‚Äôd promised her the world, but what he gave her was a phone that never rang and a bed that stayed cold for weeks at a time.

He‚Äôd taken the job to make a better life for them. ‚ÄúJust a few years on the road,‚Äù he‚Äôd told her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll save up, then I‚Äôll come home for good.‚Äù
That was thirty years ago.

They‚Äôd had a daughter ‚Äî Katie. He saw her once when she was six. She‚Äôd drawn him a picture of a truck with a stick figure waving from the window.
‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs big truck,‚Äù she‚Äôd said. He‚Äôd kept that picture folded in his wallet for years, until the ink bled and the paper fell apart from sweat and time.

Now she was grown. Married, probably. Maybe with kids of her own. He wouldn‚Äôt know. He‚Äôd missed everything ‚Äî the birthdays, the graduations, the first heartbreaks, all the things a father was supposed to be there for.


---

The CB radio crackled to life with static, a ghost voice breaking through.
‚ÄúBreaker nineteen... anyone out there?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. He hadn‚Äôt used his handle in years. Ghostrider. Fitting name now.

The loneliness had started as a choice ‚Äî the road was simple, predictable. Asphalt didn‚Äôt argue. Mile markers didn‚Äôt judge. But over time, it had turned into something else, something that wrapped around him like a chain. Now the silence hurt more than the noise ever had.

He reached into the glove box and pulled out the small revolver he‚Äôd bought in Kansas years ago. It was clean. Always clean. He turned it in his hand, feeling the cold metal press against his palm.

He thought about the motel rooms, the diners, the faces that blurred together across decades.
He thought about Mary ‚Äî how she‚Äôd waited as long as she could before leaving, voice shaking when she said, ‚ÄúYou love the road more than me.‚Äù
He hadn‚Äôt argued. She was right.

He thought about Katie ‚Äî the daughter who‚Äôd once believed her dad was a hero in a big red truck, before she learned what kind of man he really was.


---

He set the gun down on the dash. Outside, the wind was rising, carrying the sound of distant engines ‚Äî other truckers still moving, still running from something.

John let out a long, shuddering breath. The cab smelled like diesel and stale air. He felt every year of his life pressing down on him.
He reached for the ignition, but instead of turning it off, he turned the radio up ‚Äî static again, then a song, old and familiar.

It was one he and Mary used to dance to in the kitchen, barefoot on the tile. He closed his eyes and let the memory play out. For a moment, he could almost feel her there, laughing, her head resting against his chest.

The tears came then, slow and quiet.
He wasn‚Äôt ready to die.
But he didn‚Äôt know how to live anymore either.

He sat there until dawn painted the horizon in pink and gold, the road glowing ahead like something holy. He looked at it one last time, then whispered to the empty cab:

I thought being home would help.
I‚Äôm sleeping again, I guess. Eating. My parents think I‚Äôm fine.
But the house is quieter than it‚Äôs ever been.
Even the fridge hum sounds wrong now, like it‚Äôs pausing to listen.

I told myself I‚Äôd stop posting. Then the lights started flickering at the same pace as the song.

It‚Äôs strange how quickly everything goes back to normal after something like that.
My mom washed the blanket the cops gave me, but the smell didn‚Äôt come out.
I told her to just throw it away, but she kept it in the laundry room.
Every time I walk past, it still smells like that pine air freshener.
The same one that hung from the cruiser‚Äôs mirror.

Dad keeps saying I ‚Äúsaw things.‚Äù
He‚Äôs not wrong. I did. I saw everything.

They want me to go back to school next week. Guidance counselor, re-entry plan, all that.
They think routine will help me forget.
Routine. That‚Äôs what the chanting was too. Routine.

At night I keep hearing faint noises, like footsteps in the attic or the house settling.
But it‚Äôs the rhythm that gets me. Always the rhythm.
Three beats, pause. Three beats, pause.
Once I timed it with my phone stopwatch.
Exactly the same interval as the wipers on Hartley‚Äôs car.

I tried recording it. Nothing picked up. Just the low hum of the house.
When I listened back, though, there was a voice.
A woman‚Äôs. Soft, like she was right beside the mic.
She said my name once, like a parent calling a child from another room.
Then the static cut out.

I didn‚Äôt tell my parents.
I just turned off every light in the house and sat in the dark until morning.
It felt better that way. Quieter. Cleaner.

Mom said someone from the school wanted to stop by.
She thought it would be good for me, ‚Äúclosure,‚Äù that word everyone keeps using like it means anything.
It was a bright afternoon, colder than it should‚Äôve been for late October. The trees outside our kitchen window looked washed-out, like they‚Äôd been overexposed.

The man‚Äôs name was Mr. Gleason. Guidance counselor. I didn‚Äôt remember him from before.
He had kind eyes, small smile lines that didn‚Äôt move when he smiled.
He sat at the table, notebook in front of him, hands folded on top of it like he was about to pray.

Mom poured coffee. I just sat there.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had quite the scare, Colin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre safe now. You know that, right?‚Äù

The words were soft, practiced.
He said them the same way the detective did. The same way Hartley did.
I nodded because that‚Äôs what you do.

He made small talk, grades, senior-year plans, maybe college. I stared at the steam rising from his cup. The smell was pine. Not coffee. Pine.

When Mom stepped out to grab something from the dryer, Gleason lowered his voice.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen what waits out there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt. It can feel like a burden.‚Äù
I froze. My throat locked up.
‚ÄúBut it isn‚Äôt,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a calling. You survived because you listened.‚Äù

He smiled wider then, and his front tooth was chipped, same as the officer‚Äôs. Same exact shape.

Before I could say anything, Mom came back. Gleason‚Äôs voice brightened immediately.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make sure he‚Äôs caught up on his classes,‚Äù he said, closing his notebook. ‚ÄúEverything will go back to normal.‚Äù

He shook my hand before leaving. His palm was rough, calloused, the way wood feels after it‚Äôs been sanded too smooth.

After he left, I looked out the window.
He didn‚Äôt get into a car.
He just walked toward the end of the street and kept walking until the trees swallowed him.
Mom said I must‚Äôve missed his car turning the corner.
I didn‚Äôt argue.

That night, the wind wouldn‚Äôt stop.
It wasn‚Äôt loud, just constant. The kind that never changes pitch, like it‚Äôs holding its breath.
The trees outside scraped softly against the house, and every time I thought it had stopped, it started again.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I got up around two and went to get water.
The hallway felt colder than the rest of the house. The digital clock on the microwave blinked 3:03 when I passed.
I remember thinking I should‚Äôve unplugged it weeks ago.

When I reached the back door, I saw it through the window.
Something sitting on the porch rail.

At first I thought it was a pile of sticks from the wind, but it was too symmetrical.
It was shaped like a person, small, maybe a foot tall. Twigs tied together with thin string, bent arms and legs, head tilted to one side.
No face. Just two short splinters crossed where eyes would‚Äôve been.

The wind made it rock slightly. Back and forth. Back and forth.

I opened the door just enough for the air to rush in. It smelled like the forest after rain.
The same smell as that night.

I wanted to take a picture, to prove it was there, but my phone died as soon as I unlocked it.
The screen went black. No low-battery warning, just gone.

When I looked back up, the effigy wasn‚Äôt on the railing anymore.
It was sitting on the doormat.

I shut the door. Locked it twice.

By the time Mom came downstairs the next morning, it was gone.
She said the wind must‚Äôve blown something over, that I was half-asleep.
But the dirt marks on the mat were still there, tiny footprints made from wet soil.
Two rows of three.
Like a child‚Äôs shoeprint, or maybe something with fewer toes.

I left my bedroom window open that night.
The air was still, heavy with that sweet-rot smell of wet leaves.
Somewhere a dog barked once, then nothing.
The silence had weight to it.

It pressed on my chest until I could hear my own pulse in my ears, three beats, pause. Three beats, pause.
At first I thought it was just that: my heart, filling the gaps between sounds.

Then I realized the gaps weren‚Äôt empty.
Something else was keeping time with me.

A hum.
Low, careful, almost shy at first.
Like someone trying to remember a tune they hadn‚Äôt sung in years.

It came from the vent above my desk.
Not loud, closer to a vibration than a voice.
But it was there.

The same melody I‚Äôd heard in the clearing.
The same rhythm the wipers had kept.
The same pattern of everything since.

I should‚Äôve turned up the music, or shouted, or done anything to drown it out.
Instead I found myself matching it.
Breathing with it.
Then humming.

My voice blended into the air, off-key, uncertain, but the pitch found me.
Every time I paused, the hum filled the space exactly.
Like it was waiting.

The more I tried to stop, the easier it became.
It wasn‚Äôt even singing anymore.
Just listening.

I don‚Äôt remember lying down, but when I opened my eyes the sky outside the window was the same color as ash, the hum was gone but the rhythm stayed.

In the drip of the faucet.
In the creak of the house settling.
In the breath between my own thoughts.

I think I understand now.
The song was never meant to scare us.
It‚Äôs what keeps everything connected, every tree bending the same way, every heartbeat finding its place in the pattern.

When you stop fighting it, it isn‚Äôt noise anymore.
It‚Äôs balance.

Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear it humming through the walls.
It doesn‚Äôt ask anything of me.
It just waits.

I think maybe it‚Äôs waiting for me to come back.
And when I do, it‚Äôll finally be quiet again.",2,1760138983.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1o3gev3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1o3gev3/back_pain_question/,Back Pain Question,"Hi everyone. I am wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms like mine when dealing with gastritis. I am confused about the back pain. Quick background: I‚Äôve had on and off heartburn, treatable with pepcid and diet improvement. Last month I stopped taking pepcid without weaning off and did not change my diet much. I did not realize rebound hyper secretion was a thing unfortunately. A few days later I started getting stomach pain, back pain and nausea. I went to my Primary Doc and they advised me to go back on pepcid and start omeprazole after checking me. A few days later I went to the ER with severe stomach pain and nausea. Docs were great gave me zofran and did ultrasound and bloodwork. All clear and advised visit gi doc. Went to gi, got zofran prescribed and endoscopy scheduled. Upper endoscopy showed some inflammation in stomach and lower esophagus. Biopsy all normal. Continuing on bland diet and 20mg omeprazole morning and 10mg pepcid at night. I feel like I‚Äôve improved a lot since the start of all this, but the flares up still happen if I am not careful. I tried soda the other day and it gave me the gnawing stomach pain, tender to touch, and the back pain. Today I had green juice and didn‚Äôt realize it had orange juice and pineapple in it, got the back pain between should blades burning, lower back pain etc. Another day I had ranch dressing and I got the back/Shoulder blade pain. (Didn‚Äôt realize it contains vinegar and garlic). I am just so confused because I‚Äôve dealt with heartburn from coffee for years and never had this back pain. Docs said it can be referred pain from gastritis or esophagus. Does anyone else have this ? Thanks so much!

**TL;DR:** You're running on four completely different thought patterns (inner image, outer image, others image, life image) that are totally misaligned. The biggest blind spot? You don't believe others when they sell themselves to you, but you think everyone believes you when you do it. I'll show you how to align all four and actually get the response you want from life.



Listen. I need to tell you something about how your consciousness actually works.

First, let me introduce you to you. You have so many questions, answers, confused concepts about you. Let me first introduce you with the logic of your consciousness.

With a small drawing I'll explain. This is like cartoon. This is like cartoon of all of us.

# The Four Thought Currents Running Your Life

**Inner Image**

Whatever you think inside you about you ‚Äî many ideas, all that put together ‚Äî is called inner image.

Listen, we have multiple ideas about us. When you wake up before having a cup of coffee: ""Oh God, one more day I have to drag."" After a cup of coffee: ""I think I'm okay, I can do it."" When you are really hungry, you became a cinema heroine throwing tantrum. And after a meal you get a little settled and behave like a housewife.

No, it's not only about women, it's about men also. There's no gender in this.

Now, how can a simple chemical imbalance in your body, hormonal imbalance in your body, a little tiredness or little boredom change the idea you carry about you and bring tremendous confusion?

How many of you understand what I am saying? How many of you experienced what I am saying?

Now whatever I am talking is the fundamental problems of modern men: multiple ideas, thought currents you have about you. Sometimes very bright and positive. Sometimes very negative and hopeless. Sometimes you remember all the success and feel wow, I have done so many breakthroughs, so I have a big, very beautiful future. Because the same way if I give more breakthroughs done one side, the other side: no no no no no no, I stuck with this one big problem, I don't know how I am going to break through.

Understand, both are factual but not actual. There's a big difference.

Listen, all the ideas you have about you ‚Äî actually only if you start taking accounts of this, you will understand what a mad house going on in your head. Almost the apartment complex is going on in your head. You are no more a bipolar or tripolar or even a giant family ‚Äî your apartment complex. If you sit and take notes you will understand the apartment complex running in you about you.

All that put together is your inner image. The thought currents you cherish ‚Äî right or wrong, good or bad ‚Äî the thought currents you cherish about you, your existence, your hopes, your desires, your future, your fears, you are good, you are bad, you are right, you are wrong, you are possibilities, you are victories, you are failures, your dangers ‚Äî all, all about you and your existence.

How to take a stock? Whatever you remember is the thing you cherish most. If you don't remember some inner image, then good, it's not part of your problem anymore. Sometimes people come and say ""oh Swamiji there is a big problem"" ‚Äî I don't remember that problem at all. Then it is not a problem anymore. Understand, you are healed, you completed. If you don't remember, then why are you bothered about it? Only if you remember, it's a problem.

**Outer Image**

All the ideas you project outside you about you to others ‚Äî to your father, to your mother, to your spouse, to your boss, to your son, to your daughter, to various people in your life ‚Äî how you project you to others, how you sell yourself to others.

All of you are a brand. At least you are trying to build yourself as a brand. You are constantly selling you by every idea, every act, every talk, every thought current, in every meeting, every situation. Not only you are trying to sell yourself to your boss ‚Äî even to your subordinate, servant, you sell you. How you are trying to advertise you, project you, present you to others ‚Äî all that put together is called Outer Image.

Please understand, inner image ‚Äî the ideas may be different, different, different ‚Äî but all those ideas will have a certain pattern. Same way the Outer Image ‚Äî to your spouse you may project yourself differently, to your son you may project yourself differently, to your boss you may project yourself differently, to your subordinate you may project yourself differently, to your father differently ‚Äî maybe it is different, different ideas for different, different people, but there will be a pattern.

The way you perceive you, the way you project you, is Outer Image. Never believe both of them are going to be same. Sometimes dead opposite, completely opposite.

**The Blind Spot That Changes Everything**

And the next paradox in human life, one of the biggest blind spots:

Listen carefully. You go and project yourself, brag yourself to your friend or boss or somebody, and come back from that meeting ‚Äî how you feel? See how clever I am. You really believe the other person bought what you sold. Am I right?

But when somebody comes and brags about them, advertises them, pushes them on you ‚Äî do you believe? When you don't believe others image, how do you expect everyone believes the way you project you?

Come on, tell me. You don't believe when others project their images on you. ""Huh, this fellow is trying to play game with me."" When you think you are that intelligent, how do you think wherever you go and sell yourself, people will believe?

How many of you feel this is the biggest blind spot you never catch?

Understand, this is one of the important ignorance. And ignorance is not cute. Ignorance is not cute. With this ignorance, you are projected progress in your life will not happen. You are projected response will not happen. You are projected response from the outside, the others, will not happen.

**Others Image**

How others perceive you is others image. How you perceive you is inner image. How you project you is Outer Image. How others perceive you is others image.

Want to know what others image is? Tell your friend and take the promise from your friend not to tell you, and your friend immediately gives you missed call and then you call back and he gives you the whole brief. That's Swamiji's image. I think now everyone understands Swamiji's image.

**Life Image**

When you don't get or achieve what you want because of all these blind spots, you come to certain conclusion about life, others, whole world, Universe, God, everything. ""Nothing, anything I touch will not work."" That bunch of conclusions you keep in your head about life, God, others, humanity, everything ‚Äî that is life image.

Understand, our whole life runs only with this four thought currents.

# The Pattern You Need to See

The inner image ‚Äî if you pen down all the ideas you cherish, the ideas may be superficial, they will be there in your mind, but only when you pen down you will understand the pattern. That is what is important ‚Äî the pattern.

And then the Outer Image ‚Äî you may have a different, different Outer Image with the different, different people, but there will be one single pattern. We need to catch that pattern. That is what is the logic of your conscious functioning.

Understand, the logic with which your Consciousness is functioning. I can straight away give you, but only if it clicks with you, you will start remembering them continuously. You will remember only when it clicks with you.

How many of you discovered in this process all the four Images are a big mess? All of them are in different direction? No way they are aligned to your life's purpose or your life's interest? How many of you discovered that? How many of you realize you are almost ‚Äî your life is almost like an accident? It's there but you don't know where it is going and what?

# Here's What I Can Do For You

See, the good news I have for you: it is only bunch of thought currents. It can be changed.

The great news I have for you: I will do it for you. I can do it.

Understand, thoughts are actually diluted version of energy. Condensed thoughts are energy. I can replace the energy flow in you. So through that way I can flush out the whole, whole old negative thought patterns.

I only want your cooperation. You need to recognize what is negative. Then I can flush it out. If I just flush it out, you will think your cancer is your muscle. You will hold on to it. You will not let go. You just need to know which is cancer, which is muscle. Muscle you should retain. Cancer you should let go.

I'm giving you the commitment: I will give you the best inner image you want, best Outer Image you want, best others image you want, and best life image you want. But tell me what do you want. Only then I can help the completion happen.

I can clean up what all the parts I need to do surgery and remove and throw it. What all the part I need to nourish in you, I need to create, chisel new you. But I want you to tell me what you want.

What is really the inner image you want to cherish? What is really the Outer Image you want to cherish? What is really the others image you want to cherish? What is really the life image you want to cherish?

I can really make it for you. Understand, when I come, I'll really do it.

This is the fundamental work we need to do: completion with ourselves.



The alignment of these four thought currents ‚Äî inner image, Outer Image, others image, and life image ‚Äî is available right here, right now. To transform this understanding into living experience, the Paramashiva Sena Summit (October 1 - November 1, 2025) offers direct transmission of these completion techniques through living Siddha tradition. I can replace the energy flow in you and flush out the whole, whole old negative thought patterns so you stop operating as an apartment complex of contradictory thoughts and start functioning as an integrated, powerful consciousness.

What patterns have you discovered in your own four images? Which thought currents are you ready to recognize as cancer rather than muscle?

At the time, I was in the middle of a really nice walk to my favorite coffee shop ‚Äî just enjoying some peace and quiet. When he called, I felt a bit caught off guard and guilty saying no, so I said he could come by.

Well, what was supposed to be a quick favor turned into me basically losing three hours of my day. I had to go home, tidy up, make small talk, and just sit around waiting for him to leave. The whole time, I felt irritated that I‚Äôd derailed my plans for someone who isn‚Äôt even my partner anymore.

Now I‚Äôm annoyed at myself for saying yes and wasting my afternoon, but he genuinely didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go. Still, I can‚Äôt help but feel resentful that I keep being ‚Äúthe nice one‚Äù when I don‚Äôt owe him that anymore.

TLDR. TL;DR: My ex asked to come over while his house was being cleaned after a flood. I felt guilty and said yes, but it ended up taking three hours of my day and ruining my plans. Now I‚Äôm annoyed at him for agreeing.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for being frustrated at him?

So, i met this guy at the club, we danced for a while, he told me i was very pretty and asked for a kiss, which i denied, but before i left, he asked for my instagram and the next day he sent me a dm asking for my number so we could chat. I agreed 'cause he was super cute and the first conversation went great; he then asked me out and asked if i'd rather have coffee or some drinks, i told him coffee, and he said ""alright""...but seeing that he wasn't following up with a date and place, i asked him where and he said ""somewhere nice"", so i suggested some place to which he responded that he knew of it, but had never gone there...anyway, i told him there was another location downtown but he just ignored me and then the next day he said hi again but never reminded me of the coffee and then his replies were more dry, until a few days ago he said 'hi' again but then whenever i tried to make conversation he would just give me one word answers...I honestly felt a little bumped down so i just never sent another text and now it's been like 3 days since our last convo...i don't know if i did something? anyway, sorry if i made mistakes, english is not my first language. Thanks!

TLDR; met a guy at the club, asked for my number, first convo went great, asked me out for drinks but never actually set a time and date, kept talking to me but his replies got drier and now we're not talking. ",5,1760138240.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

Prior to this, in 2024 their gem prices from El Salvador were 249 USD and now they're around 330usd. I understand tariffs but I don't think another 100 dollars on top is 10% which the coffee tariff is imported from El Salvador to here in USA ? 

I am starting to think they are just price gouging at this point. Why is the exact same Royal gem more money 2-3 weeks after they restocked it? (Ethiopia yirgacheffe supernatural was 390 last month and now it's restocked at 412?

I understand ethical costs and everything behind the scenes, etc etc. but this seems like random inflationary prices they just add on for the hell of it, it's getting a bit too much. I know it might not seem like a lot but they keep slowly increasing prices more and more and more and it does add up as a buyer.

Would just like to add I love the folks at Royal Coffee, I just don't understand these random price hikes like stated above. ",0,1760138010.0,roasting,16,0.33,False

I‚Äôve been living with my neighbor (we share a kitchen and bathroom) for almost a year. We don‚Äôt talk much ‚Äî just ‚Äúhi‚Äù and small stuff ‚Äî but I‚Äôd really like to get to know her better.

I follow her on Instagram and she seems super cool and funny there, but in person she‚Äôs much quieter, especially around me. She doesn‚Äôt speak English, and I speak her language a bit, but not fluently ‚Äî which makes it a bit awkward.

A few small things make me think she might be open to talking more: she has a playful sense of humor (like her coffee mug says ‚ÄúHot as f***‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just literally girl‚Äù). But one time when I came home drunk from a club, we ran into each other in the kitchen and she mentioned she has a boyfriend ‚Äî though I‚Äôm not sure if that was true or just a way to set boundaries.

I don‚Äôt want to make things uncomfortable since we live so close, but I‚Äôd love to break the ice in a friendly way.

How can I start a normal conversation or invite her for a coffee without it being weird or awkward?

Not really. Not the way I saw you.

But that morning, that quiet moment in the corner of the caf√©, you shifted something in me I can‚Äôt explain. And I‚Äôve been carrying you ever since.

You were sitting by the window, sun pooling like honey over your shoulder, lighting the strands of your hair until they glowed like poetry. You had a book in your hand, a coffee resting between your palms, and a kind of calm around you that felt like truth.

And I‚Ä¶paused.

Because everything about you was a moment worth remembering.

The way your lips curled around the rim of your mug, not rushed, not for show, just present. The soft trace of lipstick left behind like an unspoken promise. I couldn‚Äôt stop watching the way your eyes danced across the page, your brow furrowing slightly when a line found you, your lips parting in silent reaction. As though the book had whispered something you weren‚Äôt ready to admit aloud.

You brushed your hair back without thought. But it undid me. That tiny gesture, so casual, so you, made the air feel charged. Like I was witnessing something no one else had earned the right to see.

And your clothes, God. Simple, elegant, effortless. That loose white blouse with the top button undone, as if the morning deserved softness. Those jeans that hugged your curves with respect, not possession. The boots that told me you walk through life on your own terms. You were sunlight and shadow, grace and gravity. You were real.

I didn‚Äôt interrupt you.

I wanted to.

Every part of me ached to.

But I knew that to speak too soon might dissolve the spell, and you deserved more than an awkward stranger interrupting your peace. So I watched in silence, holding the moment with both hands like something fragile.

But this letter‚Ä¶is the whisper I didn‚Äôt speak.

Because you, with your quiet confidence, your sacred solitude, the way your soul seemed to live in your fingertips, you made me pause. And I haven‚Äôt been able to un-pause since.

I don‚Äôt know your name yet.

But I know how your coffee looked when it kissed your lips.
I know the sound your breath made when you turned the page.
I know the way my chest tightened watching you smile at a line no one else saw.

And I know, if there‚Äôs any justice in this universe, I will find you again.

And next time‚Ä¶I‚Äôll sit down.

And speak.

But before I could move, before your eyes lifted to meet mine, the world flickered softly, cruelly and I realised‚Ä¶I‚Äôd never left the dream.

1o3fzmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o3fzmj/the_man_who_wore_you/,The Man Who Wore you,"The caretaker heard the knock between wind gusts. Three, even. Not pleading. Measured.

He unlatched the door. A man stood there, frost woven into his beard, coat stiff with rime. The stranger said, ‚ÄúI made it back.‚Äù

The caretaker blinked at that. ‚ÄúBack from where?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom the storm,‚Äù the stranger said, and stepped inside before the cold could make up its mind.

They moved by habit: kettle, fire, bench. Steam lifted from the stranger‚Äôs gloves in small ghosts. The caretaker poured coffee into two chipped mugs, the same green enamel every hand before him had used.

The stranger took his with both hands, like someone remembering warmth. ‚ÄúYou keep this place alone?‚Äù

‚ÄúOff-season.‚Äù

The stranger nodded. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA long time ago. Or maybe it‚Äôs now. Hard to keep the count straight once the wind starts telling it.‚Äù

The caretaker smiled thinly. ‚ÄúYou talk like a preacher.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a preacher. Just someone who remembers things.‚Äù

They drank. The lodge settled on its haunches. Somewhere in the rafters, a rope tapped rhythm against wood.

The stranger stared into his mug. ‚ÄúI should tell you how it happened,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHow I ended up out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said your truck stalled?‚Äù

The stranger shook his head. ‚ÄúNot this time. I was checking the traps, couldn‚Äôt see the road but I knew where it should be. I guess I got turned around and couldn‚Äôt find the lodge.‚Äù

The caretaker frowned. ‚ÄúYou mean this lodge?‚Äù

The stranger looked around the room, as if testing it. ‚ÄúYes. This one.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve been here alone all week.‚Äù

The stranger rubbed his thumb along his cup‚Äôs rim, as though smoothing time itself. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought too.‚Äù

He went on. ‚ÄúI tried to go back. I followed my own tracks, but the wind kept changing them. I saw lights ahead and thought I‚Äôd made it. When I opened the door‚Äî‚Äù He paused, smiled faintly. ‚ÄúWhen I opened the door, you let me in.‚Äù

The caretaker felt a pinch at the base of his skull, a pulse like memory misfiring. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying this already happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs happening now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were the man at the door.‚Äù

The stranger nodded. ‚ÄúSomeone had to be.‚Äù

The kettle began to hiss, slow and low, as if uncertain of its own song.

The caretaker reached for it, but the stranger was already pouring.

‚ÄúWhen I came in that first time, the caretaker offered me coffee. Asked if I was alone. I said yes. He said, ‚ÄòSomeone‚Äôs got to be.‚Äô Funny thing about that, how it sounds different depending on who says it.‚Äù

The caretaker rubbed the scar on his thumb where a trap latch had broken years ago. The stranger mirrored the motion, same angle, same absent expression.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you say you were from?‚Äù the caretaker asked.

‚ÄúBefore the storm,‚Äù the stranger said. ‚ÄúBut that place doesn‚Äôt hold. You forget pieces of it. Names, roads, which door was yours.‚Äù He leaned forward. ‚ÄúYou know the feeling.‚Äù

The caretaker opened his mouth to argue, but the words came slower than he expected. ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúLong winters blur.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it starts. The blur. Then the remembering.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemembering what?‚Äù

The stranger smiled. ‚ÄúThe story. You start hearing it as if it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

They sat in the hush between gusts. The fire clicked. The smell of snow found a way through the seams of the door.

The caretaker said, ‚ÄúGo on, then. Tell it.‚Äù

The stranger nodded. ‚ÄúI was out there. Checking the traps. A marmot had chewed the line. The gale blew and the white was disorienting.‚Äù

The caretaker‚Äôs hand twitched. He remembered. The ache in his back. The burn in his fingers. The sense of panic at being lost.

‚ÄúYou see?‚Äù the stranger said. ‚ÄúYou were there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù the caretaker said, but his voice was uncertain now.

‚ÄúYes, you were. You said to yourself, ‚ÄòNo one‚Äôs coming.‚Äô You said, ‚ÄòIf I keep moving I‚Äôll find the lodge.‚Äô‚Äù

The caretaker stared at him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember saying that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen who does?‚Äù the stranger asked gently.

The fire dimmed. Only the blue of the coals breathed.

The caretaker said, ‚ÄúMaybe you dreamed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDreams keep better than bodies,‚Äù the stranger said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why the storm tells them first.‚Äù

The caretaker gripped the table‚Äôs edge. He remembered last winter. The drifts up to the window. The quiet that ate the world. But now the memory was two-layered, one version in his mind, one in the stranger‚Äôs voice. They aligned like glass slides, indistinguishable.

‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù the caretaker whispered.

‚ÄúI walked into the white,‚Äù the stranger said. ‚ÄúThought I‚Äôd meet the man who‚Äôd take my place. You looked like me, so it was easy. The storm loves a good likeness.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying you were me.‚Äù

Outside, the storm shifted. The walls creaked as if something vast had rolled over in its sleep. The kettle gave a last sigh.

The caretaker stared into the fire. ‚ÄúTell it again.‚Äù

The stranger began from the start. ‚ÄúA man lost in the storm, trying to get to shelter.‚Äù

The caretaker closed his eyes and saw it.

He whispered the next line before the stranger did. ‚ÄúI stumbled, too weak to get up.‚Äù

The stranger‚Äôs voice was quiet, kind. ‚ÄúThe cold took over.‚Äù

The caretaker nodded, as though remembering the answer to an old question. ‚ÄúI succumbed to the storm.‚Äù

They spoke the last words together. ‚ÄúSomeone had to.‚Äù

They found him by the stove, wearing the caretaker‚Äôs parka, frost clinging to his beard.

‚ÄúYou the one called it in?‚Äù a rescuer asked.

He smiled. ‚ÄúStorm‚Äôs done its work.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone else here?‚Äù

He nodded toward the window. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs out front. Needed a bit of rest.‚Äù

They stepped outside. The snow had taken a body halfway, left the rest for witness. Ten yards from the porch he lay, head turned toward the door, as if still listening for the last line of a story he‚Äôd once told himself.

I would like to make friends, preferably women, to talk about our things, without any expectations in mind, just friendship. However, I would prefer to meet single people, like me, to avoid unnecessary drama. I don't care about age, religion, skin color or country of origin. Only matters that you are a good person, compassionate towards the disadvantaged, educated and kind. I consider myself a pacifist and I am not involved in politics or controversies (beyond whether Ross and Rachel were taking a break). ü§îü§îüòÖ 

My day to day life is happy, although somewhat lonely: I live alone, although I usually take my parents out to eat every other day; I love movies, series, coffee, and going out for walks. I have a few friends, and I don't see them very often. But this doesn't particularly worry me; just enough to write this post and ""see what happens."" üòâ I'm quite optimistic and jovial, with a great sense of humor (I love memes). As I mentioned, I lead a quiet life... What else? I like reading science fiction and fantasy, literary classics, and philosophy; playing video games (I have a PC and Nintendo Switch), graphic design, collecting (Funkos, Star Wars, etc.), studying languages, and taking naps. üò¥üò¥

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR WDIS POSTS**

* Position-specific scoring rules (PPR, TE premium, 4 or 6 pt passing TD, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, std/PPR, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
* This week's opponents of your players
* Entire roster if helpful

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

----------------

**WE HAVE A BOT THAT CAN REFERENCE THE BORIS CHEN RANKINGS AND GIVE YOU FEEDBACK**

To invoke the bot, comment anywhere in this sub in the following format:

!boristiers position [player, player, player...]

Where position is a standard position acronym (dst, flex, qb, rb, te, wr) and player, player, player... is a comma-separated list of players for that position. Here's some examples:

!boristiers flex [hunter henry, keenan allen, melvin gordon]   
!boristiers rb [matt breida, tevin coleman]  
!boristiers qb [lamar jackson]  

The bot will reply to your comment with a table of player ranks in the format of {tier}.{position_in_tier} for each of the applicable forms of scoring. If a player is not found / ranked, they'll be denoted as N/A.

----------------

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only the player name. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you would start that player.
* Remember most people know how to look up rankings. They come here for discussion, start a discussion!
* **Please respond directly to the OP or the Bot will not pick up your comment**

----------------
**individual WDIS threads posted after this point will be deleted in order to keep the subreddit clean. Post here instead! If everyone sorts by new, your questions should be answered.**

1o3fsmo,https://i.redd.it/f83c6i5wzcuf1.jpeg,Yay! Completed my first 7-day water fast,"M, late 50s, 5-11"", 198 lbs to start, somewhat muscular, healthy. About ten years ago I did a few weeks of ADF and one 2+ day fast, then in 2024 did two 3-day fasts, then this year a 6-day and now 7-day fast. 

The main thing I want to say is **THANKS** to all the people involved with this group. Reading about everyone's experiences gave me the knowledge and confidence to try the longer fast. When you see so many people do 5, 7, 10, 12, and longer fasts, it naturally dawns on you, Hey why couldn't I too? And everyone IRL tells you it's dangerous, you're going to die, etc. Given how easy it turns out to be and how good it feels, I'm astonished that at age 59 I've NEVER known a single person who's done a week-long fast. 

Like a lot of people probably, I have a long history of on-again/off-again sugar abuse, and doing the longer fasts feels like a good way to reset my system. Plus it's kinda fun actually. 

Just a few notes/observations:

* Took electrolytes daily by mixing Lite Salt with 16oz water, 5-6x/day, and one 500mg magnesium pill.  
* Drank black coffee daily and three 20oz Coke Zero's over the 7 days. Broke the fast with homemade chicken and vegetable soup. 
* Definitely could've gone longer. Looking I think to do semi-annual or quarterly 7-10 day fasts. 
* It was cool seeing myself shrink on a daily basis.
* On this fast I aimed to maintain a normal workout schedule at lighter weights, but just couldn't do it. I think it was just a mental fear of pushing myself too hard; will look to improve on the next fast.
* Walked 10K+ steps on a treadmill daily. This actually had the surprising effect of making me feel better each time. I work and sit during the day and kept finding myself feeling kinda terrible by the end of the work day. Most days I'd take a nap, and then drag myself to the gym. After walking for awhile at 2.5mph, then 3, then 3.2+, I'd gradually start feeling better then great. This happened every single day. 
* One question I have is, Have other people had the experience of not really being able to exercise their regular schedule when first getting into longer fasts, but then the more they did them, the easier they got, and then regular exercise while fasting was no big deal? If so, how many extended fasts did that take?
* Post-fast I've got a 36"" waist measured at the navel. Any stories from people who've had success getting rid of their visceral fat via fasting, especially over age 40?",38,1760137253.0,fasting,3,1.0,False
1o3fsc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1o3fsc4/is_it_possible_to_make_an_app_that_blocks_your/,Is it possible to make an app that blocks your card after too many fast food runs?,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this idea lately. What if there was an app that could connect to your debit or credit card and let you set your own spending rules?

For example, you could make a rule where if you‚Äôve spent a certain amount of money or gone to a place a certain number of times, your card would just stop letting the transaction go through. So if I‚Äôve hit McDonald‚Äôs or Taco Bell five times this month, it would automatically decline the next one and (theoretically) make you go to the grocery store.

In theory it could even use AI to recognize and group merchants together, like all fast food, coffee shops, or delivery apps, so you could set limits for categories instead of individual stores.

I‚Äôm just curious how realistic that actually is from a fintech or banking perspective. Could something like that even be built with how card networks and banks work right now? What would be the biggest challenges, technical or legal?

Has anyone seen anything close to this already? I‚Äôd really like to hear from anyone who works in fintech or payments and knows what would make this hard or possible.",1,1760137234.0,fintech,2,1.0,False

This post assumes that you have at least some knowledge of MCAS, SIBO, how the small intestine works. So I suffered with SIBO probably for around 3 years. I say probably because I got covid some time in 2022 and assumed the condition I suffered with for the following three years was long covid. Up until a few weeks ago, I suffered with the following: whenever i ate food, I started to get brain fog, irritability, hot flashes, extreme amounts of burping, bloating, drowsiness, and mild itching. I also suffered with constipation (like bowel movements once every 3 days). Based off these symptoms, if you do a little research on what you could possibly get from covid that would act like this, you arrive at something like MCAS, but the problem is I knew it wasn't MCAS because the symptoms did come from eating, and would mostly only happen when I did eat. The crazy part is it would also sometimes happen sometimes when I didn't eat (like if I fasted for a day or two). It wasn't all that bad because at least I could kind of live my life if I didn't eat anything too bad or inflammatory, it was pretty annoying though because eating anything unhealthy or super super tasty which, let's be honest, is most of the food in America would have come with consequences beyond weight gain or getting the itis.

  
So I started experimenting with things like L-theanine because I figured it's a really beneficial compound that's good at calming the body and also probably good at calming mast cells, started taking a multi vitamin and a bunch of supplements that are supposed to help with long covid, and while those things did help somewhat, they didn't eliminate the main symptoms that dropped my quality of life from great to okay.

  
I then saw that one famous guy on youtube who talked about his SIBO story and how ginger and artichoke basically cured him, so I ended up buying a product from sprouts farmers market called Gut Motility by the brand Enzymedica. I would take one in the morning and one at night, and I did notice it helped somewhat but not a lot tbh. I was almost confident though during this time that what I had was SIBO, mostly due to the insane amount of burping I would get EVEN AFTER DRINKING WATER. Insane right??? Drinking water made me burp almost constantly for like 5 mins afterwards.

  
So I go to a gut doctor and tell her I'm almost confident I have SIBO. I give her the symptoms and do a breath test and what do you know, my hydrogen goes up after 100 minutes, and methane goes up somewhat. I think at the 100 minute mark I had like 24 ppm hydrogen and 10 ppm methane, which was in fact enough to confirm hydrogen and methane SIBO. So I now have evidence to confirm my theory that I have SIBO and also started rifaximin, which worked while I took it, but made me feel weird and my symptoms came back after I stopped. So I started doing research and looked up what some good brands of ginger and artichoke to increase motility are and I end up buying Motility Activator by Integrative Theraputics (all thanks to Dr. DiNezza - Gut Microbiome Queen for her video on the best motility supplements, this one was ranked at #1). This brand helped a lot when I took it in the morning and if I drank coffee after taking it I was almost guaranteed to have a bowel movement. Except when it stopped working :/ At this point I was kind of hopeless, ginger and artichoke is supposed to help a lot with this type of stuff right? Well I continue to take it in the morning because some help with having a bowel movement is better than none, and I keep doing research on SIBO. I believe it was thanks to someone who commented on a reddit post about it who said that they take it right before food. I'm thinking okay if it doesn't work that well when taking it in the morning it probably won't when I take it with food, but I try it anyways.

  
And when I tell y'all I take it 5 minutes before eating and have a bowel movement an hour or so later literally every single time and I mean it. And the other awesome part? Because I've been taking it with food for like a month, I literally have the most minimal of symptoms after I eat. No hot flashes, no fatigue, no drowsiness, minimal itching (because I think I do have at least some sort of post-covid condition but it's NOTHING compared to the beast that is SIBO), and no extreme burping. I'm finally FREE of this god awful disease!!! I haven't stopped taking it yet but I think I'm gonna take it at least until the end of the year, then I'll probably stop it and see where I'm at.

  
TLDR: If you haven't tried ginger and artichoke, or if you have and it didn't work for you, try taking 1 in the morning, and take 1 a few minutes before you eat a meal. I personally have like 2-3 meals a day and this strategy has helped me the most out of anything I've ever tried!!! I would also recommend that if this works for you to begin paying attention to your gut health and look into things like maximizing Motility, the MMC, Peristalsis (which taking this supplement with food should help a lot with), and Gut Barrier Integrity, all of which can be maximized by eating the right foods, sleeping enough. I know that since I'm getting better and better every day I can really start to focus on all the other aspects of gut health.

   * **I will NOT hold or save specific items** for anyone. Everything is **first come, first served.**

   * **Don‚Äôt worry if your number is higher than today‚Äôs total of 14 offers.** Sometimes people don‚Äôt respond, can‚Äôt follow through, or the timing doesn‚Äôt work out ‚Äî so even if you‚Äôre number **18 or 23**, you still have a chance. Just be patient.
   * ***IF YOU BECOME UNAVAILABLE BEFORE I REACH YOUR TURN, PLEASE COMMENT TO LET ME KNOW.*** *This helps keep things running smoothly and prevents me from waiting on someone who‚Äôs no longer able to pick up their offer.*
2. **Unsolicited DMs will be ignored.**
   * Please do *not* message me before I message you.
   * Once it‚Äôs your turn, **I‚Äôll DM you first** with instructions.

4. When it‚Äôs your turn, I‚Äôll ask:
   * the **ZIP code** of the McDonald‚Äôs you‚Äôll be picking up from
   * whether you‚Äôre using drive-thru or counter pickup
   * and I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs still available at that point (you can‚Äôt claim items early ‚Äî what‚Äôs left changes constantly).
5. After I place your order, I‚Äôll send a screenshot with the code to show at the drive-thru or counter.
6. Please reply to your original comment once you‚Äôve picked up your food so others know it‚Äôs legit.



**A few quick notes:**

* I can only redeem one offer every 15 minutes. If I‚Äôm ordering for different states, the app sometimes glitches ‚Äî just be patient.
* If you won‚Äôt be near a McDonald‚Äôs for a few hours, maybe skip this round so I can keep the line moving.
* It‚Äôs still **first come, first served.** I can‚Äôt hold items or guarantee certain ones.



**Once all offers have been claimed:**

* I‚Äôll change the post‚Äôs **flair to ‚ÄúGiven‚Äù** so everyone knows that the day‚Äôs giveaways are complete.
* If I have not DM‚Äôd you by that time, unfortunately today wasn‚Äôt your day ‚Äî but **don‚Äôt give up!** You can always try again tomorrow.
* I‚Äôll also hang around in the comments for at least **one hour after the last offer is claimed** to answer questions, chat, or offer tips for anyone who wants to try doing this themselves.



**Important note:**  
As of yesterday morning, **some areas of the country are experiencing issues where there are no available participating locations for redemption.** This is completely **out of my hands.**

To help me identify whether you‚Äôre in an affected area, when I DM you, I will ask for the **ZIP code of the McDonald‚Äôs location** you plan to redeem at. Please have that ready ‚Äî it helps me verify availability and saves us both some time.",6,1760136916.0,Freefood,67,0.75,False

Some of the events of this feud are:

**1916-05-07** ‚Äì \[New York\] Louis DeMarco is murdered on Navy Street by Alfonso Pepe aka Raffaele Daniello, allegedly due to DeMarco failing to respect the Navy Street Camorra territory for selling cocaine. Daniello later says Alessandro Vollero shot DeMarco. After the killing, Daniello sends his wife and children back to Italy and then asks his 16-year-old mistress, Amelia Valvo to obtain $500. Valvo steals some jewels from her mother, and Daniello and Valvo later travel to Philadelphia. It is rumored that Amelia Valvo is the daughter of James Giordano, who is Daniello‚Äôs godson.

**1916-06-24** ‚Äì \[New York\] A meeting is believed to take place at the Santa Lucia Restaurant in Coney Island between

* Nicolo Terranova ‚Äì Morello Family
* Stefano La Sala ‚Äì Morello Family
* Charles Ubriaco ‚Äì Morello Family
* Leopoldo Lauritano ‚Äì Navy Street Camorra
* Alessandro Vollero, Navy Street Camorra
* Pellegrino Morano, Brooklyn Camorra boss.

The idea of the meeting is to discuss the expansion of gambling in lower Manhattan. At the meeting, Morello and La Sala propose that killing Giuseppe DeMarco must occur before that can happen. DeMarco, a former Morello ally, apparently arranged the killing of a ‚ÄòDeMartini‚Äô on East 108^(th) Street which causes the Morello‚Äôs to mark him for death at some point in 1912. In 1912, it is believed DeMarco took over a card game on Mulberry Street controlled by Morano as well. The Morello family and the Brooklyn Camorra plan to open a card game at 167 Hester Street that will be run by Morano, Angelo Giordano, and Nick ‚ÄòThe Fixer‚Äô Canarelli.

**1916-07-20** ‚Äì \[New York\] Giuseppe ‚ÄòJoe‚Äô DeMarco and Charles Lombardi are murdered, both seated at a long table in a vacant flat at 54 James Street by Morello member Giuseppe Verazzano, with Navy Street Camorra members John Fetto, Bartolomeo Pagano, and John ‚ÄòLefty‚Äô Esposito. Lombardi is shot 10 times, and DeMarco is shot once in the head. With DeMarco‚Äôs death, Pellegrino Morano opens a numbers game in Harlem, the territory of the Morello family, but the returns are not sufficient to cover the tribute that the Morello family demands. Hit set up by Leopoldo Lauritano, Navy Street Camorra boss. ¬†Allegedly, Nick Sassi, an employee of Demarco‚Äôs but also friend of the Navy Street gang, gets the gunmen inside. It is believed Lombardi is killed because he looks like DeMarco. Morano‚Äôs game in Harlem was inherited from Tomasso Lomonte, Stefano LaSalle, and Eugene ‚ÄòCharles‚Äô Ubriaco, who later gave it to Antonio Celentano, until Morano purchased it from Nicholas Terranova. After Morano later loses the operation, Giovanni Tartaglione acquires it.

**1916-??-??** ‚Äì \[New York\] Totonno La Morticella tells Pellegrino Morano, Lorenzo Romano, and Antonio Notaro that the Morello family wishes to keep the policy game. Morano fumes that even after he has lost $1500, the Morello ‚ÄòSemen‚Äô want to keep the policy game. Morano calls the Morello‚Äôs to confirm this news. The Morello family confirms they wish to keep the game uptown, and Morano vows to ‚ÄúShow them who Don Pellegrino Morano is‚Äù and that he will have them all killed. Antonio Parretti advises that he will visit the Navy Street Camorra and speak with Alessandro Vollero and Leopoldo Lauritano. Later, all of the Navy Street Camorra, except Leopoldo Lauritano, visit Morano in Coney Island. Vincenzo Parapalle is believed to be the only one who argues to not attack the Morello family.

**1916-??-??** ‚Äì \[New York\] The Brooklyn Camorra attend a meeting in Philadelphia with Camorra leadership, eventually deciding to eliminate the Morello LCN and take complete control of Manhattan. Andrea Ricci demands Nicholas Terranova, Charles Ubriaco, Giuseppe Verrazano, Stefano La Sala, Ciro Terranova, and Vincenzo Terranova be murdered. Alessandro Vollero wishes the Morello Family dead for the murder of Nicolo DelGaudio 1914-10-19. Philadelphia is believed to provide the guns for the murders of Ubriaco and Terranova 1916-09-07.

**1916-09-07** ‚Äì \[New York\] Nicholas Terranova and Eugene ‚ÄòCharles‚Äô Ubriaco, are lured in a trap by Andrea Ricci, who invites the men to a chat with Coney Island Camorra boss Pellegrino Morano and Navy Street Camorra boss Leopoldo Lauritano. The men first come to Panzoni restaurant where Alfonso Pepe aka Raffaele Daniello serves the Morello men drinks, before Bartolomeo Pagano arrives to take them to a coffee house, where Lauritano and Morano are allegedly waiting. The men walk together towards Myrtle Avenue when they are ambushed at the junction of Johnson Street and Hudson Avenue. Terranova and Ubriaco are shot and killed by Bartolomeo Pagano, John Esposito, and Thomas Carrillo. Hit organized by Alessandro Vollero and Antonio Paretti. Detectives from the Sixth Branch bureau then arrive, including Michael Mealli, under the pay of the Navy Street Camorra. Mealli arrests Rocco Valente, after Valente is found in a local pool hall with a loaded pistol. Vincenzo Terranova becomes boss Morello family with his brother‚Äôs death, Ciro Terranova becomes underboss, and the Morello family declares war on the Brooklyn Camorra. Giuseppe Verazzano was supposed to be murdered by the Camorra, but failed to appear with Ubriaco and Terranova. The Brooklyn Camorra take over some of the artichoke rackets and control of gambling in the area with the killings of Terranova and Ubriaco. It is later revealed that Mealli is not the only law enforcement on the Camorra payroll, and that the group is also paying off Charlie Carrao, 1^(st) Branch Detective Bureau, Bennie Grottano who brings Daniello back from Reno, and someone named Castagnia. These payoffs are typically done through Nicholas ‚ÄòNick the Fixer‚Äô Canarelli.
