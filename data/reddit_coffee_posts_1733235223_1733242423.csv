it's like the people around me can't accept me for who i am. i think things through, consider all the negatives and positives, and I'm called overthinking too much. i expressed my feelings and thoughts and I'm called disrespectful and changed as a person- as one said ""may tumutubong sungay yan"". i am talking in the most friendliest and open person, and then i am targeted on being exploited for my kindness. and when i am troubled, i am called overthinking it a lot, should stop what I'm doing, should stop questioning and hold faith in god-

bruh, I'm trying to live despite having and not being able to manage my self who always feel sad, existential dread, met with jokes to fill their egos and put light on a serious situation bcs that's the only bullshit they can think of. 

god, i really need a good coffee and place to have a chat in. ",1,1733242212.0,OffMyChestPH,1,0.99,False

The incident happened back when I was a kid. My parents were at a high-school reunion all day so I invited my friend Jason to hang out with me in the backyard. We did a bunch of silly stuff like using sticks as swords and pretending to be superheroes. It's a bit embarrassing to admit since we were already in 6th grade at the time, but that's the fun of being a kid. You're always living in the moment and doing whatever you feel like. I was so caught up in having fun that I didn't notice my cat Frisky getting up to trouble like usual. He always had a knack for climbing up tall places.

Bookshelves. Fridges. Tree branches. He went anywhere his paws would take him.

This time Frisky decided he wanted to venture further beyond my house. I didn't realize Frisky had climbed up my backyard fence until Jason alerted me at the last second. I caught a brief glimpse of the devious shorthair feline standing on top of the fence before leaping on the other side.

Panic immediately consumed me. There were a lot of close calls before, but this was the first time Frisky ran away from home. I told Jason to stay in the backyard in case Frisky came back while I went searching for him. Since I lived in a brownstone house in Brooklyn, my neighbor's house was actually on the opposite side of the city block. I took off jogging down the block until I ended up in front of the house that was parallel to mine. I gave the doorbell a ring a few times, but the owner never came to answer.

This made me even more restless so I did something I knew I'd regret later. The latest summer heat meant that many people kept their windows open and this guy was no different. It was my luck that the window didn't have a screen protector.

This was an incredibly risky move on my part, but I feared that Frisky would end up running away if I didn't find him in time. No way was I going to wait for 911 to do something about it.

I hastily made my way inside, rushing past the living room and kitchen until I reached the backyard. It was a wild garden of overgrown plants and unkempt items. Finding Frisky was much like searching for a needle in a haystack. I couldn't even call out for him because that would've alerted the homeowner. Who knows how many minutes I spent looking for that cat. Every second felt like an eternity. At any moment I could've been caught by the homeowner and have the police called on me.

Or even worse. It was a pretty rough neighborhood. It wasn't uncommon for someone to shoot an intruder on sight regardless of how little danger they posed. Human life was just that cheap to some people. 

As if my prayers were answered, a soft string of meows came to life. I quickly followed the source of that familiar voice and found Frisky hiding underneath a table at the far end of the yard. There were so many weeds and clutter surrounding the table that it took me a while to spot Frisky. I scooped him up and gave him a great big hug. I was relieved to finally have my friend back. 

I rushed through the house and was about to make my exit when I bumped into a coffee table and knocked over a scrapbook to the ground. Several pictures went sliding across the floor. Not wanting to leave behind any evidence I was ever there, I hurriedly began putting the photos back in place. As I was putting everything away, one of the photos caught my eye.

It was a picture of a young redheaded boy with freckles and a yellow hoodie. I recognized it instantly. It was Jordan Cambell.

He was a boy who went missing in my neighborhood a few months back. His missing posters were hung pretty much everywhere you looked. In the photo, Jordan seemed to be walking the streets alone with a hand stretching out to reach him. I opened up the scrapbook to see countless photos of young boys taken from several angles. Some featured kids playing in the park or the pool. The camera was uncomfortably zoomed in on their chests and legs. I almost dropped to the floor when I saw one picture at the very bottom of the page.

It was me, getting changed in my bedroom window. It was taken late at night and my bare chest was exposed from the side.

A heavy pair of footsteps came from upstairs and they seemed to be approaching the stairs. I tucked the picture into my pocket and took off running with Frisky in my hands. I ran like hell all the way back home. My heart was on the verge of bursting from my chest the entire time.

Jason immediately saw something was wrong from the way I was sweating with a thousand-yard stare on my face. I told him it was nothing and tried playing it cool until he went home.

As soon as my parents came back, I spilled the entire story with tears in my eyes. They didn't even have time to be mad at me for breaking into someone's house because I showed them the picture of me in the window. I'll never forget seeing the color drain from their faces while their mouths hung open.

The events after that all just blurred together. I remember getting questioned by police and having to go to a court hearing. Apparently my neighbor, named Larry Samchez, was a serial killer with an obsession with kids. He abducted them throughout the years and would horrifically butcher them into pieces. Some of the remains were kept in the basement while others were stored in the backyard. I could've very really been the next victim on Larry's kill list. I guess I should be grateful to Frisky. I never would've found any of this out had he stayed home. Sometimes a little curiosity just might save your life.

I am dropping to 5 pumps per day now and feeling so much better overall.

It was a long grueling 6 months with MOTN pumps, clogs, figuring out how to pump on the go, figuring out how to pump while working full time at 10 weeks post partum… oh, and the time I poured coffee into my 32 oz pitcher of milk bc I was so beyond sleep deprived:’) (I will NEVER forget the outpouring of love you all showed me. Someone literally sent me a Starbucks gift card to cheer me up and it made me cry.)

But I did it! Thanks to you guys! And I plan to continue until 1 year but don’t care as much about my output anymore. Pumping to this level has caused so many health issues - both physical and mental, and I’m ready to feel a bit more like myself again.

For my first attempt, I took the Classic Cutz Pro Pack that was made for the iMPC Pro 2 app and made an expansion featuring 4 drum kits, and three instrument kits. My journey into the world of MPC and producing all together started with the apps on my iPad.  I had a lot of fun with those apps and made a lot of music.  So, I figured that I would pay tribute by giving this to you guys.  Have fun with it, post some of your beats, and if you're so inclined, drop a couple bucks in my Buy Me A Coffee so I can continue making content for the masses.

I will be taking this link down on December 14th, so get it while it's available.  And if you need help installing expansions, there's plenty of videos and articles online that will help.

No matter what I do, the drip coffee tastes more like coffee flavored tea, more watered down than 7-11. Its recommending a grind size of 25 which was terrible. I went down to 15, and it tasted muddier, but not really stronger or richer. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong here, but I also feel like it's putting out too much water.

I didn’t have pockets, so I asked her to carry my drivers license and cash.  (Usually only take $30, as my limit)

The internet seems hotly divided on this subject. My own husband doesn’t have a particularly strong feeling, he wants to support what I think is right, but doesn’t feel as though it’s entirely our responsibility to bring this all to light.

I (40f) had a mostly online/social media emotional affair with an ex bf. This primarily occurred over the course of 6 months and ended a month ago. We met up twice. Once just for coffee and to talk. The other time we were alone at his office after hours. I told him ahead of time I was only comfortable talking and maybe a good bye hug. While there he touched and kisssd me in places/ways without permission (while saying no) and forced me to touch him in places/ways without permission (while saying no). I was pretty shocked and very upset because we did not agree to that. I confessed everything to my husband that same day.

I didn’t speak to him for a couple of weeks, but struggled with both the trauma of what happened and missing him. So I reached back out seeking an apology. I sorta got one. But he was being more emotionally attentive to me so we talked again for a couple of days. 

After a few days I ended things. This time for good- I laid into him about his behavior for the first time. I knew calling him out would finalize the situation and now we’ve both blocked each other on all forms of communication.

I again told my husband what happened. He’s very kind and understanding. We have the right supports in place. We’re both back in individual therapy as well as marriage counseling. We’ve told our close group of friends. We’re committed to doing the work to repair and I’m confident we will (though he knows I respect whatever he decides he needs to do).

My question now is: do I tell the wife?
I don’t know her. She doesn’t live close (a few cities away, not a quick drive). They have children as do I. I am aware this is not the first time he’s had some sort of infidelity to confess to (though I don’t know the extent of the others). And if so, how much do I share?

I don’t have most of the messages, but I have some. Including the one where he “apologized” for hurting me and some others. 

Any advice appreciated. Thanks.

Typical we have flat whites, I will drink an americano type coffees if I have a coffee during the day.

I'm 31/Female with Hashimotos(diagnosed this summer, started levo 25mg beginning of September but had to up my dose to 50mg in November because TSH was up at 12.2) and hypothyroidism. Also, have gotten my gallbladder removed in Feb of this year. Prior to gallbladder removal, I've had unexplained weight loss(over 20 pounds in less than 6 months), overall fatigue and general feeling like something isn't right. My bilirubin was high before gallbladder removal, but it went higher after and has been going high since and staying high. It was 1.5 Saturday and 3-3.2 a week ago. I have fatigue every day and a hard time sleeping or getting good sleep. My doctor ordered a liver ultrasound as well as some blood tests - my Half brother has Gilberts Syndrome which makes his bilirubin high for no reason, but they needed to run tests to get the actual answer and make sure its that or if something else is really wrong. I also want to mention, I had cholestasis of pregnancy in April 2021 at the very end of it, and they never followed up with my labs after that, didn't even mention it or even seem concerned. Also these labs are not fasting labs, as my doctor told me not to. I was supposed to get them done in the evening time but they closed after my appointment so these are morning numbers after a bowl of cereal and coffee.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound: Minimally prominent common bile duct statistically likely related to  
postcholecystectomy state.  
Bilirubin fraction:

Bilirubin total: 1.5 (it was just around 3 just a week ago in the hospital so I'm assuming all these numbers were higher then)) range is 0.2-1.3

Bilirubin indirect: 1.2 (normal range is below 1.4)

Bilirubin direct: 0.3 (normal range is below 0.2)

Haptoglobin: 121 (normal range 31-238)

Reticulocyte count: Retic % 2.2 (normal range is 0.4-2.0)

ABS Retic: 0.100 (normal range 0.018-0.1)

LDH: 132 (normal range 135-214)

Vitamin D 25 hydroxy: 32.5 (normal range 31-80)

Iron: 120 (normal range 41-186)

Together for almost 3 years. I’ve always known that he has a female friend, and they’re pretty close. He talks to her about our relationship issues to get the female perspective, which I’ve been okay with since I also have a male friend that I confide in similarly.

When we lived together, he always took her calls in his car or at the gym, which he does with everyone, but it still found it strange.

About a year ago, I went out of town for 10 days and I saw him conversing with her on our ring camera and they were scheduling a time to hang out. When I got back, I asked if he spent time with any friends while I was gone, he said no. Recently, I brought it up again, and he said grabbing coffee with her didn’t count as “hanging out.”

Lately, I’ve been feeling uneasy about the extent of their relationship and I asked if they’d ever been to each other’s houses, and he said no. Then I asked to see their text messages, he began scrolling through his phone quickly past a section. I told him to slow down, and what I saw HURT.

She texted verbatim, ""Thank you for always being a goof friend to me, and I love you"" He hearted the message and replied ""Thanks"" She later sent him a relationship report on their birthdays and asked him, ""Do you think these are true about us"" He responded two days later with ""Some of them are"" A few days later he texted saying, ""Just got back in town"" with a googly eye emoji, she then replied, ""I'm here""

When I confronted him, he said the report was about me and him, but her text said “us.” I also talked to her, and she claimed they discussed our relationship offline and that the report was about their dynamic. When I said the “I love you” and the report felt inappropriate, she told me I shouldn’t police how they communicate and said my boyfriend is a support system for her since she’s lonely in the city. He proved they were only on a call at that time, and both denied meeting up. I don’t think they’ve been intimate.

I also learned he’s lent her money several times. He says she always pays him back, but it hurts because he’s so frugal. He’s asked me to sign a prenup (which I’ve agreed to), and I’ve never asked him for money. It was even so difficult for me to even ask him to pay for my flight to see him for Thanksgiving.

A year ago, she was arrested over a scammer guy she was dating. My boyfriend bailed her out, and while she likely paid him back, it’s just another example of how much he does for her.

I don’t have an issue with their friendship, but there don’t seem to be any boundaries, and I think she might be falling for him. This worries me because it’s similar to how I fell for him—he was always there for me, and I developed feelings and we quickly went from friends to bf and gf.

I love my boyfriend, but I’m struggling with his lack of transparency. I don’t think he’s into her romantically, but I worry about where this could lead. AITA for confronting him about not setting boundaries with her?",3,1733240875.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

However, for the last several years, I have solely only worn three perfumes. Prada Candy, Prada Candy Kiss, and Prada Candy Gloss. (Candy Kiss would probably be my “signature scent”) and these have been in my rotation for a long time now. But the issue I have with these is they don’t last on my skin, let alone my clothing, so by the end of the day I don’t smell my perfume anymore and that’s always been a bummer. After reading reviews here for the last couple years, I finally decided it was time for me to start exploring indie fragrance houses! My first choice was Solstice Scents, and I do have orders coming from Cocoapink and Sorcellerie that I’ll be reviewing soon enough (: thank you all to have posted here to help me narrow down my selections! I can't wait to continue on this journey. The star of the show today, Solstice Scents, was truly exceptional and I'm honored to have tried them as my first house.

So yeah, please keep in mind I’m pretty new to perfume since I’ve worn the same three for so long. I am a writer so I’m *hoping* you’ll be able to get a sense of my thoughts on the scents I chose, but I’m sorry if I’m not great at describing them yet!

Btw a huge shoutout to u/Many_End_8393 for some of the recs, I saw they said some of these were their favorites (Nightgown, Foxcroft Fairgrounds, Violet Mallow, Rose Mallow Cream) and since I already had those exact four in my cart, I immediately ordered them along with Smoky Mountain Mallow! Lavender Vanilla and Estate Vanilla were also among their faves so they're on my to-try list. I may or may not have a sample of Estate Vanilla coming as of today lol.

PS: I did a video review as well on my little YouTube channel, which is mainly indie shadow focused but now I'm planning to mention indie perfumes as I try them. I don't want to self promo here but if you're interested just DM me! (:

On to the reviews… (notes from my phone over a couple weeks so, may be all over the place. sorry in advance!)

**1) Foxcroft Fairgrounds - Cotton Candy, Cream Soda, Vanilla Taffy, Funnel Cakes, Powdered Sugar, Crisp Fall Air, Woodsmoke, Incense. DARK GOURMAND/INCENSE/EARTHY.**

My goodness. I’m so glad this is the first one I wore. Literally couldn’t stop smelling my wrist and sleeve the entire day. I could pick up on almost every note except maybe the funnel cake, but I definitely got the powdered sugar towards the end of the day. This is amazing. It’s even better than I expected. Such a comforting smell that reminds me of when I was a kid going to my hometown’s state fair every year, with a cozy bubbly twist from the cream soda mixed with cotton candy. Brings on all the nostalgia. 10/10, it’s so unique and pretty, and I love the incense/smoke notes to tie the sweetness together and make the aroma a little extra cozy, like a fire from the hearth. It’s like you’re walking through the fairgrounds late at night, there’s a bonfire in the distance, people are smoking and burning incense, maybe there are witches present performing magick rituals and setting positive intentions into the universe as you’re drinking cream soda and holding a bag of cotton candy you probably are about to eat too quickly. lol, I am thoroughly obsessed now and totally plan to at least get a rollerball. But if I had the money to order full size of this, I absolutely would! 

Side note - one day I accidentally overapplied and then when my husband drove me to work, he was like babe. relax. lol, he still loved it though and just bought me the rollerball so I could cry from happiness. But yeah, two or three sprays is more than enough with this one! Don't do five like I did lmao.

**2) Full Light - vanilla, white amber, golden amber, whipped cream, white orchid, white velvet VANILLA/AMBER/WHITE AMBER. Summer Collection. (free 1ml sample of oil in my order!)**

At first I wasn’t into it when I first applied it, but I’m thinking it was the amber throwing me off. Like my first instinct was to scrub it, but I wanted to give it a chance and I’m really glad I did! I generally like amber but prefer it to not be too overpowering, which is what I felt upon the first application. But as it wore on my skin, I could start to smell the vanilla and orchid peeking through. Not my favorite but definitely still a good one, as long as you like amber that is. I love the warm vanilla twist on it. Whipped cream and vanilla begins to come forward as time goes on. This is a sexy vanilla amber scent for sure. I don’t think I would buy a full size just because I’m into sweeter perfumes than this, but I would absolutely try it again. A little goes a very long way too, so I could see myself using the sample throughout the winter anytime I want something that gives cozy with a hint of vanilla but still warm and spicy. (By spicy I mean sexy, not spices). 

I know it’s supposed to be a summer scent, but to me it could be a year round thing especially for the colder months. The warmth from the amber makes me think of this amber pot pendant this guy gave me that I used to love, where the inside of the pot contained amber resin. I was constantly taking the top off and inhaling it lol, it smelled great to me. I was devastated when I lost it, and this is very similar to the scent I think back on fondly when I’m reminded of the necklace! Minus the vanilla and whipped cream, but I feel like those notes just play up the amber in a way that isn’t too much too fast. They definitely help to round out the different ambers. As time goes on, I can smell what I think is the velvet note. Warm and fuzzy aromas all around. If you don’t like amber though this is not gonna be for you because the vanilla and whipped cream really take a backseat here. I could detect the amber the entire day, but it becomes soft powdery vanilla amber towards the end of its wear. It grew on me as time went on. 7/10.

So I'm an esthetician as well and was giving a facial the other day when I went ahead and used Full Light as aromatherapy on my client - she freaking loved it! It was so cozy and sensual, said it was a great way to end the facial. Now I'm considering a rollerball for my amber needs and for this reason too, to use as a pick me up after my facials because it's such a pretty, relaxing, beautiful scent (:

Side note - I wore this dabbed on my wrists at work, Sephora, where I also sprayed a little bit of Valentino Born in Roma and guess what faded. Not Full Light! Together it was a pretty amber floral scent until the Valentino vanished, leaving me with just the aromatic ambers. Then since I only had Full Light left on me, I tried it paired with Black Opium and liked that combo better. But I’m not into Black Opium very much, I felt like I was expecting so much more from this perfume but on me, it’s just the white florals and I can’t pick up on any coffee or vanilla. With Full Light, I felt like it turned into a sexier smell. Pretty but warm and fierce. 

Last update. Full Light paired with Black Opium Over Red (cherry version) was a winner. I would totally do this at work again lmao. It was so pretty! The dark cherries and vanilla mixed with the amber and vanilla from Full Light in a really nice way. It’s the next morning as I’m writing this and I can still detect a faint lingering ambery vanilla with a hint of red cherries. Interesting. Would pair these again! I like the Red version of Black Opium more than the OG, which surprised me. Normally not a big cherry person. BUT I definitely like Full Light best on it's own, I was just having fun layering as I was bored at work! 

**3) Nightgown - vanilla, white chocolate, tuberose, tiare flowers (sample of the oil, not EDP). FLORAL/GOURMAND.**

This scent wasn’t as strong on me so I already had the feeling it would fade throughout the day, but it opens with white floral mixed with vanilla and as it dries down, it becomes softer, like powdered sugar almost as the white chocolate aroma starts to show up. Then I could slowly start to tell the white chocolate note was becoming present. The florals are stronger when you first apply but the vanilla and white chocolate scents come together to overpower them, leaving the tuberose and tiare flowers in the background as time goes on. By the end of the day I did reapply my sample just because it had faded into a powdery sweet scent. I don’t know if I would full size it just because it didn’t want to last on me, but it’s still a beautiful soft floral gourmand scent so I would consider a rollerball of the perfume oil. Will definitely keep testing. 8/10 only because of the lasting power, and I’m not a HUGE floral person unless it’s sweet like this. If the florals were any stronger it wouldn’t be rated as high. Absolutely beautiful perfume, just wish it lasted as long as the first two I tried had! But I also work in a department store surrounded by other fragrances, so I absolutely will have to wear test this again when I’m not at work. Totally possible I just got overpowered by my customers spraying all the Sol De Janeiro and Versace fragrances around me lol.

Update: I actually think I like the softer lasting power of the oil because I get very intense migraines, so when I still wanted to smell good but not have my scent bother me, this is what I reached for. I liked how I could only smell it on my wrists or wherever when I wanted to, it didn't project too much at all so it made those days more pleasant. Sometimes my perfumes can be a bit much when it's a bad head day. Love it. I even got a sample of the EdP to try, and the staying power is much better. I would still use up my oil though since it was perfect for my shitty migraine days. 

**4) Rose Mallow Cream- Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk. GOURMAND/FLORAL.**

This one gets me every time! I am in love. It opens smelling of sweet, sugared rose petals with a hint of vanilla sweetness. I really like it so far, and it’s only been ten minutes! As I’m wearing it I can tell the marshmallow is really starting to come through. If you don’t like sweet perfumes you would hate this. Now today is Nov 6, and when I saw the news… I felt like trash so my stomach is turning and I woke up with a migraine, so I’m worried that me feeling like shit may impact my experience today with this perfume. I hope not. So far I can slowly start to pick up on the white musk in the background and the strawberry plus white chocolate notes are becoming more apparent. This is a beautiful sweet rose scent, I hope it lasts on me! 

Initial reaction is 9/10, only because I have a migraine so maybe that’s what’s making me not wanna give it an immediate 10. Migraines love to make my life hell nearly every day, and luckily I’m not usually fragrance sensitive unless it’s a super strong floral, I’m much more light sensitive. This one doesn’t seem to be fucking with me too bad yet, I can still enjoy the perfume. It’s definitely very sweet so if you are looking for a true rose, this is giving vanilla soaked rose petals infused with marshmallow. It’s beautiful to me though. I would 100% full size this in the future! But for now I’m thinking a rollerball will be my immediate next purchase from Solstice Scents! Makes me wicked excited to try Violet Mallow Cream later this week.

Update: I honestly just could not stop smelling myself all day. I got lots of compliments from people telling me they loved it, asking if it was a perfume they could buy at work (I work in a Sephora at Kohl's). Haha sorry, no. I wish. I would 100% buy this in the future and totally can’t wait to do so!! When my migraine went away and stopped screwing with me I thought “oh my god yes. she’s such a fucking winner.” 10/10 is my official rating. It's gorgeous and made me feel gorgeous too.

**5) Smoky Mountain Mallow - Wood Smoke, Fossilized Amber Resin, Guaiacwood, Labdanum, Nutmeg EO, Marshmallow. SMOKY/WOODS/MALLOW.**

I had a feeling this one was gonna be different! now if you don’t like incense/wood smoke type of smells you absolutely would hate this, but I love woodsmoke! It reminds me of my nana's house where she burns wood in the woodstove during cold New Hampshire winters, truly one of my favorite nostalgic scents in existence so I love to have it in a perfume version. Also, I was a stoner teen who would always burn incense to try and pretend like I wasn’t smoking in my bedroom. Not like it worked though haha. I’ve always loved smoky aromas so I knew I wanted to at least test this out and see how it reacts with my skin chemistry. This perfume totally smells like an incense I used to have and love! Actually, that’s a huge reason why Prada Candy Kiss is such a yummy perfume to me because it smells very similar to an orange blossom vanilla incense I used to burn, just a classy perfume version with musk notes instead of any smokiness. Smoky Mountain Mallow on the other hand has a presence to it that kind of reminds me of like, Nag Champa, another fave incense of mine. 

When you first spray it on your skin, you can very much smell the smoke. They say it’s a smoke scent with marshmallow in the background, not the other way around, so I didn’t expect anything less. But the longer it wears, that’s when the sweet marshmallow starts coming into play. Definitely a unique perfume. I’m glad to have the sample because otherwise I would be dying to know what it’s like. I don’t know if I would buy the full-size because I would probably prefer something more toasted marshmallow and musk with maybe some slight smoke in the background, (for example I have a full size of Cocoapink’s Marshmallow Fireside on the way, the B&BW candle is an all time favorite for me, so I had a feeling their dupe would be up my alley) but I’m not saying I don’t like it. I probably give this one like a 7 out of 10, I just don’t think I would buy a full size of it. but I will absolutely enjoy it while I have the sample. I am considering a rollerball because now that it’s been on my skin longer, I can start to get a stronger marshmallow fluff scent from my skin. So it’s much more smoky when you first spray it, then it kinda does the reverse! Incense/smoky notes are still very much there but beginning taking a backseat so you know what… I think I would at least get a rollerball IF I could afford it one day on top of the other ones I’m obsessed with from Solstice Scents. I could see this being a nice wintertime scent or even a great perfume to sit by a summer campfire with.

 I would agree with Solstice Scents that the fragrance gets sweeter as time goes on, so I like that. But again, this would be a bad one if you can’t stand any smokiness to your perfume, so I’d look at something else if that’s you! I can see myself using up the sample and maybe my thoughts will change by the end of it, but for now I could picture myself buying a rollerball eventually. I just would absolutely not buy a full-size because I don’t think it’d be something I’d wear often enough to warrant a bigger bottle. I prefer really sweet yummy “I wanna eat that” gourmands or floral leaning gourmands (if you can’t tell).

**6) Violet Mallow - Marshmallow Cream, Violet Flowers, Vanilla Bean, White Musk. GOURMAND/FLORAL.**

I just sprayed this as I’m typing and HOLY. FUCK. Instantly my favorite of all of these, and I wasn’t let down by any of them! I have weird OCD tendencies and one of them is that I have to “save the best for last” in my mind, whether I’m eating a box of assorted flavored candies (my husband thinks I’m ridiculous when I’m picking out my favorite jelly beans or mike and ikes to eat last lmfao) or trying new eyeshadows, and I guess it still applies when I’m trying perfumes lmao. Damn was my instinct correct in that this perfume oil would be my favorite. I’m in heaven right now! I love violet, but not a fan of like.. those really powdery florals that sometimes happen when violet is present. so I love that the vanilla bean and marshmallow cream balance it out and make it a sweetened violet. This is SO incredibly gorgeous you guys. I feel and smell so pretty today! I’m going to do a purple eyeshadow look to match the vibe haha. 

So if you’ve ever been to France and had eau de violette, or violet water (it’s just violet syrup mixed with water. My French exchange student I was paired with years ago showed it to me when I was in France with her and I’ve loved it ever since. Tastes like a sweet grape with a hint of florals, so good lol) I can definitely get a similar aroma from the sweet violets in this perfume. The marshmallow adds a sweetened creamy element and while I can still detect the powdery violet as well, it’s not too much to where it smells like my grandma’s bathroom. I’m just obsessed. I will update as it wears to see if it evolves at all, but honestly, 100/10. Absolutely buying a rollerball and if I can eventually get the full size, this will be my first grab at a bigger bottle! I’m in love with it. So beautiful.

**Final Thoughts**

Rose Mallow Cream and Violet Mallow are definitely my top two. then I would say Foxcroft fairgrounds is number three, then maybe a tie between Smoky Mountain Mallow and Nightgown for different reasons (Smoky is a little bit smoke heavy, but I love it when the sweetness comes to the surface, and then Nightgown because it didn’t want to last on me) and Full Light being in last place. However, I would definitely repurchase all of these in at LEAST a sample, if not a rollerball or a full size in the future. Not a single miss! Even though I wasn’t sure about Full Light in the beginning, it really grew on me and I love the sensual, sexy amber element. I am head over heels for you, Solstice Scents! Please never leave us.

My first indie perfume experience was amazing and I truly can’t wait to continue to shop this brand and try others in the future! Well.. fuck, I have a new obsession now! For the last like three years it’s been indie eyeshadows, in particular multichromes and other gorgeous high impact sparkly shadows… but now I guess I have an indie perfume obsession forming. Uh oh 😂 my husband is not gonna love that lmao!

**The verdict…** 

**Full Size EdP**\- Rose Mallow Cream, Violet Mallow, Foxcroft Fairgrounds… but I’m not rich enough for that so for now, they will absolutely be rollerballs. 

I already bought them btw! I already have Rose and Violet, just ordered the FF rollerball today. And maybe a couple more samples ... lol. One day I will purchase all three in the perfume bottles, but that day is not today.

**Rollerball Only-** Smoky Mountain Mallow, Full Light, Nightgown

Not one that I wouldn't at least buy another sample or rollerball of!

Thank you for reading, IMAM family! What are your favorites from Solstice Scents? no matter what category I'd love to hear your thoughts! I would love to eventually branch out into other scent families I don't normally go for in the future! Overall my first indie perfume experience had a 100% success rate. So excited to try more from the brand and others in the indie perfume world!

Happy holidays everybody 💕 sending all the love to you! Thank you again for all of you who posted reviews of SS so I was able to make the best purchasing decisions for myself as a newbie to all of this. Trying to return the favor.

Me: ""maybe if you would be a better husband"".

I've apologized multiple times, I didn't mean it at all, he is a wonderful husband and I even told him I was trying to hurt him because he hurt me with his words (I know I should not have turned it on him during the apology).

So here it goes:

I (27F) had just finished meeting a friend for lunch at Assembly Row (an outdoor mall) and was walking back to the train stop. It was raining heavily outside and I didn't have an umbrella on me, so I decided to browse the Lululemon store along the way to hide from the rain. There were only around 3 people in the store, one of them being this girl (\~19-22F), who approached me. She said she had booked a hotel nearby, but when she tried to check in they told her they needed someone over 25. She was wondering if I could walk with her to her hotel and show my ID to the hotel staff to help her check-in.

Is this a scam or was she really asking for help? Her demeanor was a little off and made me suspicious, and I gave her an excuse that I didn't want to walk in the rain. I googled later the hotel check-in age requirement was 21. Also, directly across the street was a coffee store PACKED with people (not sure if she needed help why she chose the Lululemon store with 3 people in it instead of the cafe with around 30 people).

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks! :)

Edit - more details on the conversation:  
1. She said she was going to use her own credit card for check-in and just needed my ID.  
2. She kept insisting the hotel was ""only a 5 min walk away"" and would be a quick trip.",9,1733240471.0,Scams,17,0.85,False

Well for background my partners sleep schedule is different, he(23m) battles with insomnia and is convinced he functions best going to bed past 1am and sleeping to 9-10am. To me it doesn’t make that much sense but I still respect it and don’t question it as much. He values his sleep very much so. 
Me(21f) on the other hand, has a pretty tight schedule, I have to be up latest 7:30am (I choose to wake up at this time because waking up earlier only seems to amplify this issue) and I give myself only 30 minutes to get everything ready for my day of school or work. 
Before things got messy he always was disheartened when I would pass out asleep by 12am because I physically couldn’t stay up later, and I’ve tried, I’ve tried energy drinks and coffee but it almost feels like I have an issue because I really be fighting to stay awake and hang out with him but it is always past midnight so I don’t feel as bad because to me that’s bedtime, I do feel bad for how he must feel when I do fall asleep and I always apologize the day after as he will make “playful” jabs at me for passing out on the couch while we are playing video games. 
Recently I will say I’ve been trying to communicate more that I’m tired and starting to nod off when it’s happening 
Here’s the real issue, he never needs to get up super early for anything but again my alarm has been 7:30 for years and it’s mentally ingrained into me. Even on the days I can sleep in I will wake up and have to put myself back to sleep. This is where I seem to wake him up the most. I try to be as quiet as possible as I get ready but he’s just such a light sleeper and I understand if I’m being disturbing doing all the movement on my work/school mornings. Which still is confusing because for a good chuck of time I’d get ready and never wake him and leave him with a full page note and a kiss everyday, and there was no issue. 
Now even on the days off (Thanksgiving break) I’m getting the comments “I’m so tired” “I’ve been woken up early for 7 days straight” “I’m having such an off day because I kept getting woken up by you” essentially feels like he blames solely me on his lack of sleep and hearts more that we are separating so he makes it seem just like one more issue that I have that he can’t deal with. 
But I’m so confused and hurt by the comments because actually I feel like I’m not doing anything wrong. I’ll wake up early on accident (I wish I was sleeping in) and try my best to go back to bed without moving. Sometimes I’ll just scroll on my phone or work on my laptop but ig he can sense that I’m up and will wake up. Sometimes I just quietly get out of bed to charge my dead phone, vape, computer, and all the sudden he’s awake. Sometimes I take the bong to the bathroom for a quiet hit, that wakes him up. 
It’s gotten to the point today where I can’t move around in the bed or just get out of it without waking him up. I had to use the bathroom this morning and just leaving the bed woke him up and I got some sleepy mean comment about this being the second time I woke him up this morning when all I did was get out of bed and tiptoe to bathroom.

Pricing does not intrinsically cover shipping, however if you pick up multiple items I generally either split or take over the shipping cost assuming it makes sense.

With the bigger stuff, CE's etc. we can figure out the shipping cost and work out a deal there. Especially for the Death Stranding CE. That bear is going to be...interesting to ship.

I'm 31/Female with Hashimotos and hypothyroidism. Also, have gotten my gallbladder removed in Feb of this year. Prior to gallbladder removal, I've had unexplained weight loss(over 20 pounds in less than 6 months), overall fatigue and general feeling like something isn't right. My bilirubin was high before gallbladder removal, but it went higher after and has been going high since and staying high. It was 1.5 Saturday and 3-3.2 a week ago. I have fatigue every day and a hard time sleeping or getting good sleep.  My doctor ordered a liver ultrasound as well as some blood tests - my Half brother has Gilberts Syndrome which makes his bilirubin high for no reason, but they needed  to run tests to get the actual answer and make sure its that or if something else is really wrong. I also want to mention, I had cholestasis of pregnancy in April 2021 at the very end of it, and they never followed up with my labs after that, didn't even mention it or even seem concerned. Also these labs are not fasting labs, as my doctor told me not to. I was supposed to get them done in the evening time but they closed after my appointment so these are morning numbers after a bowl of cereal and coffee. 

  
Right upper quadrant ultrasound: Minimally prominent common bile duct statistically likely related to  
postcholecystectomy state.  
Bilirubin fraction:

Bilirubin total: 1.5 (it was just around 3 just a week ago in the hospital so I'm assuming all these numbers were higher then)) range is 0.2-1.3

Bilirubin indirect: 1.2 (normal range is below 1.4)

Bilirubin direct: 0.3 (normal range is below 0.2)

Haptoglobin: 121 (normal range 31-238)

Reticulocyte count: Retic % 2.2 (normal range is 0.4-2.0)

ABS Retic: 0.100 (normal range 0.018-0.1)

LDH: 132 (normal range 135-214)

Vitamin D 25 hydroxy: 32.5 (normal range 31-80)

Iron: 120 (normal range 41-186)

I just dont know what this could be? I just have a feeling that its not just Gilberts syndrome... I've been through complete hell this whole year and haven't felt like myself. Thank you if you read all this!",1,1733240066.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

1h5q1rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1h5q1rr/review_four_seasons_philadelphia_at_comcast_center/,Review - Four Seasons Philadelphia at Comcast Center,"We (family of four, two kids 10 and 6) did a mini Thanksgiving vacation to Philly from NYC and had our first stay ever at a Four Seasons (thank you to u/alex_travels for the perks!).

**TL;DR:** Outstanding location, fantastic hard product, possibly the best view of any hotel in the US (it is also the highest), an **incredible** city center pool and spa, all slightly tempered by lackluster dining and housekeeping service that (probably) had something to do with it being Thanksgiving Weekend.

[View from our room on 52](https://preview.redd.it/87yd1mndjn4e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5efc81a807767b30fd4a3f8b0f1d78de7854c72)

\*\*Cost: \~\*\*$1100/night for Grand Cityscape Double (upgraded prior to check in), Stay 2-get-1-free

**Arrival & Check In: 9/10**

We drove down from NYC and were immediately met in the circular driveway by two bellmen. They unloaded the car promptly and helped my two girls with the 43,234 stuffed animals that came with us. We ultimately decided to do valet (at $85/night) but there are a million garages immediately in the area for cheaper if you want.

You are then directed to elevator up to the Sky Lobby. If you are a fan of views, this is the hotel for you. The elevator is glass with an exterior view, and you are shot up to the 60th floor (this was actually a little much for my wife who doesn't love heights, but she got used to it). There was a bit of a line to check in, at which point a lovely attendant from guest services came over and took my two girls to a hidden wagon to pick out welcome gifts. The attendant who checked us in went over all the amenities and hotel layout thoroughly, and the service was warm without being obsequious.

**The Room: 7/10**

The rooms are beautiful and still look very new (hotel opened in 2019), but are definitely on the smaller side. Being New Yorkers, we're quite used to small spaces, but a family of four might want to consider two rooms unless your kids are still small. It's also a little bit of a bummer that there's only room for two doubles as opposed to queens, and we were **definitely** thankful for the upgrade which bought us about 50 more sq ft.

There is closet space for days, but a surprising lack of drawers. Only two in the entire room, and one has the in-room safe. There is a very well stocked mini bar with some truly laughable prices ($48 for a premade old-fashioned), but free premium water. There's also a classic Nespresso and Fellow kettle.

**The Amenities: 10/10**

The stay was worth it for the pool alone. 57 floors up, in a room heated to a comfortable 80 degrees, an infinity pool nearly 1000 feet in the air. We spent a good half our trip at the pool. We were far from the only family staying at the hotel, and at a couple of points it did get to be a bit crowded, but we had very little issue getting chairs (there are 8 pool deck chairs, two benches, and two large u-shaped couches). Also on 57 is the spa and gym. We did not use the spa but did use the gym, and it's extremely well outfitted.

**Dining: 5/10**

Here's where things took a surprising turn for the worse. What I can only assume was because of the Thanksgiving holiday, we had a number of misfires when it came to dining service. The food was always  excellent, but the service was incredibly lackluster.

Day 1:

Room service via tablet. Excellent, speedy, no complaints.

Lunch I ordered my little one the poolside kids bento box. It took over an hour to arrive (grilled cheese, fruit, cookie). The attendant who brought it apologized for the delay and mentioned the order had been lost. No big deal, but not ideal with a hungry 6 year old.

We had the 3-course prix-fixe Thanksgiving Dinner at Jean Georges, which we were very much looking forward to. We were seated at 3:50ish for a 4pm reservation, and the first bite of food (course one was not large) did not arrive at the table until well after 5pm. The entrees arrived at 6pm. Sometime around 5:30 we asked for bread for the kiddos (who were getting hangry), and that took about 30 minutes to arrive (it was freshly baked parker house rolls, which we totally appreciated, but they weren't really reading the context clues). We had to flag a waiter down after entrees were delivered to order another glass of wine. No one  offered coffee with dessert. The pies were served slightly below room temperature, like someone had just taken them out of the fridge. Not acceptable at a Jean Georges restaurant. 

Day 2:

he next morning we had breakfast on 60 at Sky High (also Jean Georges, but more casual) instead of ordering room service. Again, wait service was incredibly inattentive. Our food was delivered without my little one's order (a bagel), and it took 5 minutes to flag someone down to check on it and another 10 for it to come out (so I'm guessing it was forgotten and remade). Same when my wife asked for more Oat Milk for her coffee; we asked twice and gave up after 20 minutes. I had to ask a different waiter for the check, and we left.

Day 3:

Room service breakfast again, and it took a full 30 minutes after the promised delivery time (90 minutes after ordering). Again missing my little one's cream cheese for her bagel (she was full on ""why is this only happening to me"" mode, and I don't blame her haha). But they fixed that within 5 minutes of me messaging them on the app.

mini food tl;dr: I really hope this was the holiday messing with things, because service was lackluster to atrocious

**Housekeeping: 7/10**

Apart from not getting turndown service on two of our three nights, housekeeping was incredibly thorough. I will say that I always used the app to let them know when we were leaving the room in the morning and requesting cleaning. The girls always returned to find all their stuffed animals wrangled and posed on the bed.

**Other notes:**

I was slightly puzzled by the amount of luggage and housekeeping traffic in the guest elevators, to the point where I wondered if there is no service elevator or if it wasn't working. Not something I particularly cared about, but it struck me as odd. 

Feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer as best I can!

**Memory transcription subject:** Leon, UN “Jackal” Commando

*Date \[standardized human time\]:* February 5, 2137



The rattling of the ship was all that I felt as we touched down, well, not only that for I also felt Ada hugging tightly my chest as if I were to run off with her dog.



“**Ada, I’m going to my room**” I said as I stood up ignoring the death machine attached to me like she was a belt.



“**Rewil…**” She growled.



“**Yes, yes, I’ll check him in my room, now could you act like a jackal**?” I asked while trying to release myself from her grip. I could do so by force, but I’m not THAT heartless.



**“... I’m not standing further than four meters away from him**” She said finally releasing me just in time for the door of the cargo bay to open. In front of us, there was an expected jackal, Marie who had traveled in a different ship.



“**Welcome ea…**” She stopped while analyzing us. Neither I nor Ada showed any emotions “That bad? Where is he?” She asked, getting a light tap on my abdomen. Still felt weird having my stomach up in my chest and a med-bay where human guts would be… “**Let’s get inside before getting many curious eyes**”



Walking into the outside world, I was met with the dark sky whose stars were hidden by the light pollution, meaning I could only see a few stars, but even then, I felt at peace once the chill of the night took some of my heat away.



If I could, I would lie down and Stare at the sky for hours, unfortunately, my tail made it very uncomfortable to lie face up. Only Ada could do so due to the way her tail was designed.



“**How is he**?” She asked again.



“**The same way he was ten minutes ago, sedated until his drugs wear off**”



“**Did you drug him**?” Marie asked surprised.



“**No, he was already like that when she brought him to me. I thought that he had tried to kill himself, but I could not find anything on him. I tested every tooth, every pocket, and every place he could have hidden drugs, but I found nothing. And Ada assures he wasn’t drugged when it was with her**”



“**You didn’t drug him right**?” Marie asked.



“**What kind of animal do you take me for**?” I responded sarcastically “**I’m not that heartless**”



“**You tried to kill him**” Ada growled.



“**I SAID I was going to kill him, not that I would do so, I want my Halai to be safe**” I huffed as we got into the lift. We didn’t have to do a report other than telling the general that it was done, and it was already too late for humans to be awake.



“**So what are the drugs**?” Marie asked.



“**No fucking idea**” I bluntly stated.



“**What? Not even the med bay can identify them**?”



“**According to my med bay, he’s completely healthy, which I say is bullshit, he’s higher than a kite. I have him in an induced coma until I know what’s with him, I’m not risking it**” I said as the doors opened revealing the hallway with all of our rooms.



“**And until then? You are going to have Ada sticking to you like a barnacle to a ship**”



“**Only during the day, I wanna rest at night without having someone staring at me for the whole night”** I explained before turning to my room **“So go and take a rest**” I told Ada who simply nodded.



Looking down, I saw a rather large box with my codename in it. Picking up the heavy box with two of my arms, I used the remaining two hands to open my room’s door and soon I heard the familiar heartbeats of Halai hidden under my bed, probably just sleeping… no, not slow enough.



Suddenly my attention was brought by another set of heartbeats, more powerful than a human’s heartbeat. An arxur heartbeats, and this pattern…



“Rahade?” I asked as I stepped into my room. He was currently sitting at my working table, as all of the chairs available were designed with venlils in mind.



“Leon?!” He shouted surprised as his eyes squinted. Oh yes, the corridor is always dark so he’s only seeing my eyes…



Stepping into my room, I closed the door behind me isolating this place from the rest of the base, giving me a breath to relax my mind from all the noises I usually heard.



“Leon!” An excited voice reached me, and instinctively I knelt to reach the small alien running towards me from under my bed.



“There you are” I grabbed Halai “Didn’t expect you to meet with Rahade so soon” Suddenly I felt and saw how Halai licked my forehead. I went blank for a second as my internal AIs searched in my databanks what that meant, eventually, it came to me that it was a form of greeting between two close beings.



So like kissing on the cheeks back in Spain?



Opening my jaws, I returned the greeting drenching most of his face due to the size of my tongue. Tasting a venlil made me accidentally tune up the saliva production, but just as fast as it came, I deactivated it, I don’t wanna refill the tanks.



“Can I offer either of you anything?” I said as I set my equipment down on my table, still holding on to Halai “The corps pays me very well” I opened a drawer so tall, that only I or someone with a staircase could reach it. Inside one could see 4 glass bottles with different colored contents and some cups “I got venlil and human stuff”



“Oh there is no need” Rahade tried to refuse politely as Halai whispered ‘venlil’



“Potato potato, I’m celebrating returning home, and I have too much money that I can’t spend elsewhere. Can’t order clothes, can’t travel without causing chaos, can’t buy either a house or a car… I don’t even know if I can order food. And oh, don’t even try mentioning anything that has electricity in it. If it can run Doom, it will be overly-vigilated by the corps, and if it has access to the net you can practically forget about it” I ranted as one of my arms expertly grabbed two glasses that were then set in perfect equilibrium on my claws.



Having a purely mechanical body had his quirks, and perfect balance and perfect ‘eye’ to hand coordination were among them.



“..Okay, but just one cup. I need to get back home in one piece” Rahade sighed as he shook his head “Human please, venlil is just TOO much”



“Suit yourself” I chirped in as I opened another bottle. I would not drink much, after all, I could not get drunk, and if I wanted to drink, I would need a pool, flavored pool to be exact.



***\[Time skip 5.2 standard human hours\]***



As my consciousness returned, so did my sight.



Last night was fun. I had expected Halai to be mostly hidden or within my range due to Rahade presence, but I probably forgot that venlil drinks are STRONG, so much so that I could probably use them if my 99% alcohol ran out.



So I shouldn’t be surprised to see Halai with an…. Arxur? 



Cattle drinking with one of his butchers? Uhhhh, aren’t the Venlils supposed to be one of the most ‘Cowards’ species in the universe or some shit like that?



The thought of that filled me with… pride? Knowing that my Venlil was no coward? Well, I was probably giving him that push he needed, for he has seen me eat geckos before, not that I would eat Rahade, he’s my friend as well… eat fatally at least, NO! Not at all, he probably wouldn’t fit inside me in one piece without severely injuring himself, most geckos I’ve eaten were piece by piece, and those that I didn’t bite, I bent them in ways that no living creature should just to fit, but then again, Rahade was smaller than the average arxur.



Looking back at my bed, I could see Rahade on it, while Halai’s tail peeked from under my bed. I had slept in my maintenance station because Hala had warned me that my tail moved even while I was asleep, and I didn’t want to accidentally cut Rahade in my sleep and infect him with something because I don’t wash my tail from gore, and dirt.



Both of them were completely KO, I felt a bit bad for Rahade, but he passed a certain point where I wasn’t feeling okay with him going alone, less walking, because I knew for a fact that no manned taxi would drive with a drunk arxur behind them, and all automatic taxis were offline after 0300 hours (3 am) to 0430 hours (4:30 am) to refill batteries, thus I gave him a place to sleep here.



Moving my attention to the box that was at the entrance of my room when I came, I opened it silently before taking all of its contents while leaving them on the workbench.



Some clothes of sorts, a mask, and maintenance items like a new set of teeth, blades for my tail, claws…. etc, though the biggest thing of them all was a strange and enormous mass of a rubbery material.



Most of the things inside would need to make some kind of noise with the tools that I needed to use, but not the rubber and clothes, for those were relatively silent as far as I could tell, and with how drunk these two were, I wouldn’t be surprised if I started chatting in jackal with someone and they didn’t wake up.



Surprisingly, the rubber mass was a strange suit of some kind, with not many differences from what Marie wore to waterproof herself, though instead of it all being one large piece, it was made up of small sections with hidden straps inside. Curiously I began to pull out pieces of the white rubber until all of them were out. The largest piece by far was for my tail which by the way it was designed, was obvious it was for hiding my blades, or at least ‘babyproofing’ them.



Another curious thing I saw, was that the mask that came had a strange white mane that would hide the back of my head and most of my neck.



Strange.



Slowly I began putting on the suit. Once my legs, tail, and arms were covered, I walked a bit to check how it all felt.



GLORIOUS, my feet also had some coverings meaning I wouldn’t be making those mind-numbing clicks while walking on a hard surface. If I could, I would start crying, The rest of the covers meanwhile were…. delicate, I felt and heard how the rubber parts of some sections would rip if I did any sudden moves or any ‘inhuman’ moves such as spinning my arms 360 degrees.



Useful enough.



The clothes that came in meanwhile were extremely baggy. The pants looked like typical Japanese pants with how baggy they were, and my chest was covered with a shirt of some kind with velcro to the sides to allow for an easy opening in what I supposed to be the case for my med bay, more than a shirt it felt like a poncho.



The rest of my body though, was clothless, though not uncovered by the rubber sections. The only exposed sections that would remain, were my articulations except for my claws up to the elbows and knees which had been covered completely.



Oh, and my face! The mask was strange, instead of being placed on top of my head like a helmet, it was placed from my snout as it forced my jaws closed due to the design.



The mane that hid the back of my head and neck felt… uncomfortable, so I decided to not go with it, using it more around the neck and shoulders. Using the camera at the end of my tail which wasn’t covered, I began to look at myself. Not bad I guess, but why were we given clothes? Not like it had any practical uses like my camouflage clothes,  in fact, it was more of a waste.



“Leon?” A voice demanded my attention, for the first time in a long time, I had to actually turn to look at what was behind me, for the camera in my tail was now looking at me, and not behind, and with so many blind spots I wouldn’t risk moving my tail much.



“How do I look?” I asked, opening my arms while looking at Rahade who was clutching his head in pain. With a quick move of claws, he had now a bottle of water in front of him which he began to gulp down quickly.



“Good I guess” He said between gulps “Don’t know much ‘bout clothes…” he said looking down at his naked body. The only ‘clothes’ I saw him use were for practical use more than fashion, like most aliens, so I only saw him with a jacket, or sunglasses, though now he wore nothing and only carried a small backpack with his essentials, and a collar with his ID “I’m sorry for…” He muttered.



“No need to. I’m starving, wanna bite something?” Even though being near a starving Jackal as an alien was a death sentence, Rahade didn’t flinch or didn’t realize what I had said. Not that it mattered, it was better this way than having him scared.



“...Sure, I can get a bite” He said as he climbed down the bed. Due to his hangover and the height of the upper section of the bed, he almost fell to the ground, but before he could truly fall, I caught him with my tail.



“Woah there, you alright?” I asked as I opened the door with Rahade resting on top of my flat tail.



“Yeah, just… ugh… too much” He said as I walked to the lift.



“Hold on” I said before opening my med bay once I was sure I wouldn’t rip anything apart. At the same time, I lifted the tail so he would slide towards me, once he was close enough, I held him like a princess and gave him a tube from the medbay “Suck” I told him “It will help with the headache”



“Who is he?” Rahade asked before drinking the simple medicine while pointing at the small alien in my med-bay.



“A protegee of a friend of mine, another jackal. He’s got something off and I still don’t know what it is. Still trying to understand what happens to him”



The ride up the lift was silent, though that time Rahade was able to sit correctly on my tail, and most of his headache was gone thanks to the medicine. Once the doors were opened into the communal area of the jackals, I began walking to the cafeteria.



“Want something specific?” I asked “Imma eat some jackal rations and some coffee to wash it down” 



“Ermm, some coffee please” He asked as he sat down at one of the jackal tables. These were way taller than the average table, and their seats were designed for tall jackals like me or smaller ones like Marie or Ada.



“Got it” I said before walking to the automated buffet. Grabbing a large tray, I picked two energy bars and a jackal cup, these cups were more like a jug than a cup because we didn’t have lips, thus no actual suction power, and with no lips it would be very easy to spill everything though the space of our teeth, blood at least did so.



Oh yeah, no milk for Rahade, that’s a nono for aliens.



Grabbing another smaller cup, I went to the coffee machine before filling both cups, in my case I only filled it halfway before filling the other half with milk. For Rahade it was filled completely.



Leaving both cups on the tray with my energy bars, I then marched to the 3d print to get some actual food. It won’t be as good as freshly hunted meat, but chicken will do the work for me.



After the printer had finished, I walked back to where Rahade was waiting to hand him his coffee.



“The head still hurts?” I asked as I set the tray down to enjoy my food.



“Just a little. Whatever you gave me, it worked” Rahade said before drinking. I meanwhile removed my mask to throw one of the bars into my mouth before swallowing it instantly.



“Ewg” I growled before swallowing the second bar “Can’t they just add some artificial taste or something?” I asked myself before washing the taste off my mouth with coffee.



“Maybe it’s on purpose?” Rahade suggested.



“Has to… This program is not cheap” I muttered before chugging down the rest of my coffee. It would not wake me up, but it tasted good.



“What are you going to do today? If you don’t mind me asking” Rahade asked.



“Maintenance. I need to change some parts and refill some tanks” I explained.



“Then shouldn’t you wait until you do that before eating?” Rahade asked.



“Nah, no need. The acid has already dissolved everything solid, and in the second stomach, I’m dealing with the coffee. Give me 5 minutes and nothing will remain” I said before grabbing the 3d printed chicken with my claws to throw it at my jaws. The fake bird had bones in it, but it was so small compared to me that it was like eating candy.



“Oh…” Rahade mused “Can I help?” He suddenly asked.



“There is no need” I shook my head “Plus I don’t even know what’s in there” I shrugged before placing my mask.



“... Alright then” He finished his coffee “Can you accompany me to the gate? I don’t like the other jackals” Other jackals? Marie and Ada most likely. I could understand Marie because she’s a bit… too much, but Adda? She’s nice.



“Sure thing, automatic cabs should be available by now” I mused out loud “You have everything?” I asked. Rahade patted his bag before nodding “Alright then” I stood up and helped him get down from the tall chair.



Walking into the lift, I pressed the combination of buttons needed to go up. Once we were up, we began walking at Rahade’s speed, during the walk I saw something… interesting.



I saw a bunch of soldiers practicing a CQB drill … but I heard no heartbeats. Automated robots then? They definitely didn’t look like jackals, they looked more friendly. But they also didn’t move like total robots…



Were they enhanced soldiers of some kind’ I haven’t seen them since the earth attack when I delivered those 3 aliens.



I wonder what happened to them… Nah, I do not.



Looking to the sun, I realized something, there was a small shape up in the sky. “Zooming” my cameras revealed a vaguely humanoid shape with wings and a tail armed with a long rifle.



Another jackal model? A flying jackal unit? Huh, that’s new.



Focusing more, I could see that it wasn’t just levitating, but in fact, had what looked like small jet engines on the tips of the wings with other small thrusters in the sides of the waist. As it flew in circles I also realized that it was using the sun to hide himself if one looked at it from the building where the mock CQB was taking place.



Interesting.



“I’m sorry 001, but you can’t go past this line” Looking down, My gaze was met with a human and a yellow line painted on the ground “Jackals can’t go past this, that’s an order from high command” He explained.



“Understood. You’ve heard it, take care of yourself and if you need something, call me” I told Rahade which he simply agreed with a tail stomp.



“Good luck with your hunt Leon,” Rahade said goodbye in a typical Arxur way.



Once Rahade had left my view, I turned around and began walking to the lift. Okay, these coverings were getting on my nerves, I can’t see shit. I’m wearing them no more except for my claws, I HATE the clicking noise my claws make on the ground.



Looking at the flying Jackal, I saw that it was still a long time until their training ended, so I might as well just do the maintenance now rather than wait for it to end.



Once I made my way down the lift, I saw Marie resting by my door.



“Morning Leon, Ada is inside” Marie pointed at my room “By the vents” She explained before I could ask ‘how’ 



Walking past her, I placed my claws on the lock to open it. Inside I heard Halai still sleeping in his bed, and sitting on my workbench I saw Ada looking very impatiently.



“Where is he?” She immediately asked.



“Still inside. Nothing found” I answered.



“Let me see” I shrugged at her impertinence. Opening the med bay, I saw her practically jump at me.



“You good Ade?” Marie asked with worry in her voice.



“Y-Yeah” She nodded “Can I?” She asked.



“Hold on” I told her before disconnecting the electrodes and taking off the needles connected to his body “All yours. He might wake up tho, if he does try and ask him what he took” I saw from the camera in my medbay how Ada carefully took the small alien.



“Thanks” Ada muttered as she held the Farsul close to her.



“No worries. Now, Imma do some maintenance, I don't know about yall but I need to change my acid tanks and some parts”



“Care if I join?” Marie asked, I shrugged my top shoulders.



“Could I as well?” Ada asked before sniffing the air  “I also wanna meet your protegee” She sniffed the air before her head aimed at the bed “He’s in there isn’t he?”



“Still asleep” I nodded “Had a night of drinking”



“Yeah, everything smells sweet. Venlil drink?” Ada asked



“Yeah, how strong is your smell?” I asked because I could barely smell the sweet nectar of venlil drink.



“As strong as your hearing is” She explained.



“I’m jealous” Marie joked “I’ll get new parts, Leon come, I can’t carry everything myself”



“You can swim, we sink to the bottom” Ada growled.



“Hold on, let me get this thing off” I told Marie while I removed the poncho and chest piece “Can’t see shit with this thing on, Ada, please keep an eye on Halai until I'm back""



""Sure, I can do that"" She sighed before both Marie and I went to the quartermaster for replacement parts. On the way there Marie began looking at the few clothes and 'suit' parts that I wore



""**Off to a new mission already**?"" She asked in jackal once we were outside of the hearing range of Halai.

  
""**Fucking hope not. This was by my door yesterday, I now hate snow after** ***THAT*** **mission**"" I growled as my head twitches.

 

""**What happened over there? You never told us**"" She asked with a tilt of her head.



""**Well, I was supposed to go inside a dominion cattle facility, kill a bastard, get out, go offline for 3 months and get back home**"" I explained briefly ""**The problem came when I rescued Halai, a fur-less venlil scared shitless of me, stuck in a frozen hellhole for 3 months with no supplies. Had fun skating tho, but taking care of him was a headache""**



""**Oh... Well Afere and I met on a more relaxed mission. A submerged reeducation camp**"" She laughed ""**But if you are getting a mission s soon... I know we can't get tired, but a small rest would be fine at least**"" 



""**Really doubt it's a mission, maybe they gave me this to check if it's comfortable. And let me assure you that not hearing to my feet clinking constantly is a present from heaven, covering most of my cameras? A recipe for dissaster. Oh we are finally here, this shuldn't take long**"" I mused.

Buster growled softly, baring his teeth at me as he stood in defiance. His stance rigid and unyielding, his tail stiff, and ears pinned back - he watched my every move with alert eyes.

My 3-year-old German shepherd had intuitively figured out the prospect of an upcoming bath when he saw me reach for the towel, and decided to give me a hard time over it.

“I know buddy. I am not happy about it either. But I will make it quick. I promise,” I tried to reason, holding up both hands to reassure him.

‘But it’s not even been a week…’ I could almost imagine him saying those exact words to me when he growled back in protest.

“You’re right...But listen, man. You’re dirty. I can feel your presence from here,” I said, standing ten feet away and pretending to cover my nostrils with my finger.

Buster, of course, didn’t care and continued to defy without hesitation.

I put my hands on my hip and sighed. My glance immediately shifted to a hose attached to a tap outside my quarters.

“Tell you what. I’ll make it worth your while. You don’t mind the jet spray, right? In fact, you even tolerate it sometimes,” I said, pointing to the hose located only a few feet away.

“How about a little cooperation now, and I’ll make you your favorite meal a little later?” I asked him, while reaching out to pick a can of chicken liver from the kitchen.

As I dangled the can in my hand, I could see it slowly chipping away at his resolve, his mind grappling with the pros and cons of my new proposal.

A moment later, Buster barked at me twice and slowly made his way out of the house. He sat by the garden tap, ready to receive his bath. 

I took a handful of lotion and began to rub it against his torso to remove all the muck and grime that was sticking to his body.  We had been quite busy lately, guarding the base and conducting multiple patrols along the perimeter every day. The rain a few hours ago certainly didn't help matters, with Buster leaping over puddles of water and actively rolling in the mud to escape the desert heat. I had to use a brush to remove the layers of dirt that had caked all over his body.

It’s been a strange week, to say the least. The days were busy but peaceful, while the nights brought scattered, random sounds. Their origins were a mystery, as they appeared not to originate from the base. But I wasn’t too worried about it, not yet anyway.

There is an air base located a couple of hours away from the facility, and it wasn’t unusual for them to conduct sorties at odd hours in the night. I assumed they were probably testing out some new technology.  

My colleague Joe thought the same thing as well. But we couldn’t take any chances, and we both had a job to do. So we conducted regular patrols around the base just as a precautionary measure.

But deep down, I felt something nagging at me, like I was being watched by someone or something. I couldn’t exactly put it into words.

For a second, I wondered if Buster too felt the same way when I saw him suddenly lift his head up, listening intently with his ears up in attention.

I quickly turned back to check if there was anybody standing behind me, but I found no one. When I turned around to face him again, I saw him looking up at the night sky, his gaze focused and unwavering.  

“What’s it buddy? You see something?” I asked him as I cleared away the foam from his face. Moments went by slowly. And then, just like that, as if nothing had happened, he put his head down and began pawing my leg, urging me to finish his bath. I sighed again and turned on the hose, to wash off all the soap.

He finally looked presentable and I have to admit, his coat glistened beautifully under the moonlight.

Before I could reach for his towel, Buster swiftly moved in to close the gap between us and looked me in the eye dead serious. He then shook his body vigorously, much like a wet dog trying to rid itself of wetness, and trotted off without bothering to look back.

I laughed out loud as I sat there, drenched in water. I knew I should have seen that coming. However, my smile quickly faded, as it also reminded me of Jessica, my ailing wife.

Before another thought could take shape in my mind, I heard a familiar voice blare across the radio.

“Mike, I need you down here. Get to the post quick.”

It was my colleague Joe and I replied back in the affirmative. I quickly grabbed my gear and signaled Buster to follow after me.

When I reached the post, I saw Joe standing there armed with his rifle. As a seasoned war veteran with two tours under his belt, Joe was a dangerous man and not to be trifled with. But he was also compassionate and wise beyond his years.

“What’s up Joe?” I inquired, as I approached him near the entrance of the base.

“I am not sure yet.  I thought I heard something at a distance. It could well be nothing.” he replied, after a brief pause.

‘Well, we’ve had a lot of that going around all week’, I thought to myself.

He then turned around to look at me. “I want you to run a perimeter sweep first. Then go on patrol again. Take Buster with you” he said, before heading back to his post.

I started the jeep and drove out towards the perimeter. The engine hummed softly as I navigated the rough terrain, with Buster sitting alertly beside me. After finding nothing suspicious during my initial sweep, I decided to broaden my search radius.

A mile into the drive, Buster suddenly started barking, prompting me to stop the jeep immediately. He leaped onto the ground and dashed towards a boulder located a short distance away. I picked up my rifle and cautiously followed after him.

When I reached the spot, I keyed the mic attached to my shirt and said, ""Boss, you need to come see this.""

I knew he wasn’t going to be happy about leaving the guard post unmanned, but I thought he would prefer to come and inspect this himself.

Joe arrived ten minutes later, parking his vehicle next to mine. He walked towards the boulder overlooking a small pond, and switched on his torch to get a better look at the skeletal remains of an animal dumped nearby. Three other animal remains lay next to it, all appearing to be in a similar condition.

“These look like coyotes, probably stopping by to drink water from the pond before they were killed,” he observed, his voice expressing concern. “Did you find them like this?”

“Yes”, I replied. “And they weren’t here when I drove through the same place this morning. I thought it was quite odd to be honest, to find four of them out here all at once in the middle of the desert, that too at this hour.”

Joe simply nodded in agreement.

“What sort of creature do you think did this Joe?”

“I mean it must have a ravenous appetite to chew every sinew of flesh from the bone, and lick it this clean.” I said, leaning in take another look.

“Do you think it could be the Chupacabra or something similar?” I continued, knowing fully well my question was a bit far-fetched, but I had to still get it off my chest.

Joe finally stood up, switched off his torch, and looked around the vast open desert in quiet contemplation.

“This is in fact the fifth sighting in less than a week, Mike, and all have occurred in close proximity to secure government installations. The one before this was even stranger, and happened near a military base, where an old buddy of mine continues to serve.”

“He told me in that instance, the remains belonged to a dog. There were no signs of flesh or connecting tissue from the nasal region to the abdominal section, while the region spanning from the abdominal cavity to the tail bone was left fully intact. The whole thing was carried out with surgical precision, and drew morbid praise from even the medic back at the base.”

""But how is that even possible? What are you suggesting, Joe?"" I asked, surprised by the tone of my own voice and my inability to hide my disappointment upon hearing about it for the first time.

“This is not a hunt for prey, Mike. This is a hunt for attention. Somebody is trying to make a point. And I’d say they are accomplishing their objective.” Joe said.

When we got back to the base, Joe updated the command centre about the new developments. I headed back to my quarters and lay down on my bed. The exhaustion washed over me and I immediately drifted to sleep.

*I looked at my Mickey Mouse watch. The time was 5:36 PM. I was licking my ice cream while sitting next to my mom in the car. To my right, was my 4 year old cousin Henry who was fast asleep on his mother’s lap.*

*In the front, my dad was driving the car with his brother seated next to him. Then a truck from the opposite side suddenly came in our lane, and rammed into our vehicle causing it to turn turtle.*

*With great difficulty, I managed to extricate myself and pulled my cousin out from the wreckage as well. And then suddenly, the car exploded and went up in flames….*

I opened my eyes and realized I was still in bed. The same dream had come and gone a thousand times before. It has become a constant part of my life ever since I was a 9-year-old kid.

I slowly got off the bed and found my head hurting. I had barely slept since last night’s excitement, and my mood was already beginning to turn foul.

Buster was already awake. I gently patted him on the head as I walked into the kitchen to put a kettle of water on the boil, and turned on the TV.

My attention immediately shifted towards the news. There was a nuclear explosion in Russia in a small town that was just a couple of hours away from Moscow. The details regarding the explosion were still shrouded in speculation.

“Just the kind of news to start the day,”I groaned as I reached for a nearby chair in the kitchen.

‘But what could have caused this?’ I thought to myself a little later, and hoped the damage there was minimal.

I then looked at the clock and set about getting ready for work. I showered, ate my breakfast, and was out the door by 8, with a hot cup of coffee in hand. Buster raced ahead to get to the guard post.

Joe had already completed his shift, and was waiting for me to relieve him of his duties. We high-fived as usual, and he began to walk back to his quarters. I settled into my chair, and made an entry in the logbook.

My name is Michael , a 30-year-old security guard working for a secret government installation located in an obscure area in the hot Nevada desert. The facility is centered around a medium-sized building occupying 7,000 square feet of space.

A 10-meter-high wired fence had been erected around the base to provide added protection. There was nothing else around the facility for miles, with the exception of a few boulder fields and mountains in the distance.

For over 5 years now, my colleague Joe and I have been working in shifts to ensure the guard post is manned at all times. When compared to other secret government bases, the security requirements here are not as stringent. And yet, neither Joe nor I ever had any clue about the kind of work being done here.

Every day, like clockwork, a bus carrying 25 people would arrive at the facility at 9:00 AM sharp. I had to open the gates to let them through, once the customary security checks were performed.

These people always wore lab coats and looked like scientists. They would work in the facility until 5:00 PM, and leave by the same bus at the end of the day. In all that time, they never once smiled or waved at me. It was as if their bosses had strictly informed them to not even initiate eye contact with people outside their circle.

Anyway, I never took offense to any of that. My job was to provide security to the facility, and I was doing that to the best of my ability.

As I sat back in my chair, ready to take another sip of coffee, my phone began to ring. It was from the hospital, and I answered it. A minute later, I called Joe and asked him to stand in for me. He immediately understood.

When he arrived at the guard post, I apologized for the inconvenience and Joe simply nodded with a reassuring smile.

As I was about to climb into my jeep, I pointed my finger at Buster and said, “STAY.”.

“Take him with you Mike. She will be happy to see him” Joe said quickly intervening.

“But Boss, I don’t want to leave you here alone after last night.” I protested.

Joe waved his hand dismissively. “Get going Mike. That’s an order.”

“And don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine. Go see Jess and tell her I am rooting for her,” he said, before walking back to the guard post.

I put a leash on Buster and climbed into the jeep with him. I started the vehicle and began driving towards the city to check on my wife Jessica. She was receiving treatment for lung cancer at St Mary’s Hospital, which was a 5 hour drive from the base.

Jess had never smoked once in her life, and for her to go through all this hardship really broke my heart. I would have normally liked to stay by her side during this crisis, but I could not afford the cost of treatment on my own. Thankfully, the insurance from my government job so far helped me cover most of the medical expenses.

After arriving at the hospital, I headed straight to her room and found her with tubes attached to her mouth. She was heavily sedated and looked like she was in pain.

Buster was standing by the door looking glum. He could see that Jess was unwell. Buster came into my life as a surprise birthday gift from Jess, and he has been a part of our family ever since. The people working at the hospital regularly allowed him inside the premises, knowing fully well that his presence always helped to uplift her spirits.

I came to know from the doctor that Jess had suffered a heart attack due to long term COVID complications. While she was stable and out of danger for now, she did need to undergo an emergency surgery within the next 3 days. The surgery alone would cost $30,000, and that was not covered by my insurance policy.

I pulled Buster by the leash to tell him it was time to go, but he kept resisting. He wanted to sit by her side for some time, even though she was unconscious and unable to acknowledge his presence. So, I too pulled up a chair and sat beside him. It immediately brought back happy memories of our marriage.

We used to spend our summers going on long drives, visiting natural parks, or idly sitting by the beach, enjoying good food and playing all kinds of sports. Jess and I would also often embark on scenic routes, with no particular destination in mind, allowing the road to guide us towards hidden gems.

Whether it's a visit to a historic village or a hike through a lush green forest, all the shared experiences helped strengthen our bond as a family.

The two of us also enjoyed using Buster to pull pranks on each other. Whenever Jess gave him a bath, she would command Buster to go ‘Shake’ in front of me and I would get drenched in water, leading to fits of laughter all around. It was one of her favorite pranks.

So when I saw my wife on the bed with tubes attached to her mouth, I got the reality check I needed. I stood up from my chair and yanked harder at his leash; he didn’t resist this time and followed after me.

I walked out of the hospital feeling a bit dazed. As I started to drive back to the base, my mind was busy trying to come up with solutions. I had only $2000 in my bank account, and that clearly wasn’t enough.

‘Maybe I could contact an official from the government and apply for a loan?’ I thought to myself. I kept driving while mulling on the best course of action.

Then, at a certain point, I suddenly snapped to my senses and immediately stopped the car. I had been driving for over 4 hours now. It was 7 in the evening, and night had already fallen.

Yet, I could not spot the base in the distance. Usually, by this time, the floodlights would have been turned on, and the facility would be easily visible for miles.

Instead, all I could see up ahead was pitch-black darkness. Something was wrong.

I tried calling Joe on his phone, but he was unreachable. I pressed the gas pedal and drove as fast as I could.

When I finally reached the facility, the situation looked much worse than I had feared. The entrance gate was left half open, with no one manning the guard post. The entire building just sat there in the darkness with no power. I tried calling on Joe’s number again. No response.

I then called Joe’s boss, who was stationed in Carson City, to inform him of the situation and possibly request reinforcements. He was unreachable as well.

‘What on earth is going on?’ I asked myself. This was completely bewildering on so many levels.

I slowly drove up to the base, and stopped the jeep a short distance away from the front gate. I wanted to be able to make a quick exit, if things turned hostile. I took a torch light from the dashboard and unfastened my sidearm from the holster. After getting down from the vehicle, I softly whistled towards Buster to follow me.

When I walked past the gate and checked the guard post, I saw a body lying face down on the floor. From a distance, it was difficult to identify the person clearly, but as I got closer I recognized Joe’s uniform. I ran towards him and turned him around and got the shock of my life. I stumbled back in fear and hit the floor hard.

I don’t know what they did to Joe.

But he was lying there dead! Very dead!

It was like he had been zapped or electrocuted. The only thing that was remaining of him was his skeleton. Not an ounce of flesh was visible on his body. And yet his uniform looked in pristine condition.

‘How is this even possible?’ I asked myself.

It immediately reminded me of the dead coyotes I found on patrol the previous night.

“Could this all be somehow related? Was this an execution? And was this carried out be the same group of people?” I wondered.

Joe’s rifle was still there, leaning against the wall. I holstered my sidearm and picked up his rifle. I checked the magazine. He hadn’t fired a single shot.

I then turned on the tactical light and started moving towards the government facility. No one could enter this building until they had a high level of clearance, and every person who had clearance, was issued an electronic key card to gain access. So I was shocked to see the door was left ajar here as well.

Before entering, I headed back to check the junction box. The darkness was making me paranoid and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to fix it first. When I reached the box, I discovered that the power had been deliberately shut down.

I turned it back on, and the entire place lit up like a Christmas tree.

But the whole facility wore a deserted look. The bus that was usually used to ferry the scientists was still parked at the parking lot.

I doubled back towards the entrance, and slowly entered the building with my rifle pointed forward. This was the first time I was setting foot inside the facility. And if this was supposed to be a top research lab, I wasn’t seeing any signs of it.

The place had been hastily evacuated. There was not a single soul in sight. All I could see was waste paper and computer cables strewn across the floor. Everything else had been cleared out.

Buster then took off on his own, and dashed towards the far end of the building. Something had caught his fancy and I followed after him. He stopped against a large couch and started barking at me.

I looked down and could see something metallic hidden underneath. I stretched my hand to retrieve an aluminum briefcase with blood stains all over it. Someone was obviously holding onto it for dear life, and then tossed it underneath as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands.

‘Did the scientists manage to escape? Or did something bad happen to them, like it happened to Joe?’

‘Could the nuclear explosion in Russia have something to do with this?’

“Are the two countries about to go to war? Is this to be viewed as an escalation,” I wondered.

A hundred questions were going through my mind now, and I had answers to none of them.

I decided to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. I saw no point in staying, now that Joe was dead and the facility had also been cleared out. I ran back to my jeep, tossed the briefcase in the backseat, and began my drive back to the nearest city I could think of.

Twenty minutes into the drive, I began to get curious about the briefcase, and I had to stop the car to take a look. I switched on the light in my vehicle and opened the briefcase. There was some kind of a telescope inside.

On its base, it bore the insignia of a bright burning Sun with a single eye at it’s center. It also had a name tag attached to it that was labelled Korelo ZX4 – 1969.

The telescope in itself was a strange looking contraption, the likes of which I had never seen before. It was the size of a camcorder, and comfortably fit within the palm of my hand.

There were two identical knobs on either side of the device. The one on the left moved freely clockwise or counter clockwise. It felt similar to those old radio transistors, where you could switch back and forth between stations.

The knob on the right looked the same but had a small pointer attached to it. It had limited range of motion and worked like a switch. Close to the pointer were 3 printed dots, one larger than the other in ascending order. I guess this signified the 3 levels in which this device functioned.

I held the telescope gently in my hand and peered into the eyepiece. With the moon being the only source of light in the desert, I could hardly spot a thing. I then turned the knob on the right, and the device immediately roared to life. I could even feel it mildly vibrating in my hand.

As I peered into the eyepiece again, I now had clear vision of the space all around me. A green display had opened up and was providing clean imagery with stunning levels of detail. I slowly started to turn the knob on the left, and the telescope began to zoom in and out.

I could now clearly see the creatures of the desert ….miles away… coming out their holes …looking for prey. Their heat signatures capturing perfectly… the contours of their own bodies as they moved swiftly across the sand.

As I kept zooming in further, I could also spot the local diner of the nearest town that was more than 50 miles away. I could not only figure out the make and model of cars parked in front of the restaurant, but also read the number plates on them.

And then I looked upwards, pointing the telescope at the night sky, hoping to see the stars a little more clearly. And suddenly everything became obscure. It was like staring at a blank wall.

I moved the telescope away looking confused. Everything looked normal. There was an abundance of stars scattered across the sky, and there were hardly any clouds. I looked into the telescope again, and started zooming back, and my heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Thousands of feet high up in the sky, a large spaceship was hovering mid-air. It was big enough to accommodate an entire football field. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I just kept staring at it for several moments.

Then I slowly began to pan the telescope across the skyline, and soon realized that I was in for an even bigger shock! There were at least two more spaceships thousands of miles away. Make no mistake. They were clearly visible as the one I was standing in front of.

‘Ok Mike, What else you got?’ I said out loud to myself.

I then turned my focus back to the ship in front of me, and turned the right knob again.

The second dot got highlighted on screen, and the telescope suddenly zoomed in to reveal the insides of the spaceship.

The unfolding images were a little grainy but still definitive enough to provide sufficient visual quality. It was like an X-ray, CT scan and MRI all rolled into one. As I kept adjusting the left knob to get a clearer visual, I could see a large workstation occupying most of the space inside the ship.

Close to the panel, two people were standing and conversing with each other. They did not look human at all. In fact, they looked like aliens!

By this point, I was already sweating even as the cool winds of the desert were hitting my face, and ruffling my hair. I continued to stare into the telescope completely transfixed. I turned the right knob one more time.

The last big dot got highlighted on screen, and then I suddenly started hearing weird noises. Buster who was keeping silent all this while, let out a soft howl and dug his face into the sand. But the noises didn’t stop. It sounded odd and animal like. Like the garbled speech of someone attempting to speak with a mouthful of water. I realized I was now eavesdropping on the aliens talking amongst themselves.

I think they figured this out as well. Because one of them abruptly stopped speaking, and walked towards a work station, and then punched something on the console.

In a matter of moments, the other alien turned around and took a step forward in my direction. It looked like he was peering down at me, fully aware of my existence. A wry smile appeared on his lips, and I felt a shiver go down my spine.

I immediately switched off the telescope, put it back in the briefcase and ran towards my jeep. Buster followed after me. I decided to get to the nearest town and drove as fast as I could.",2,1733239550.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1h5pvqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetZoo/comments/1h5pvqg/the_worst_possible_planet_zoo_update/,The Worst Possible Planet Zoo update,"My husband and I got into the game recently and have been playing the heck out of it. 100 hours later, we were trying to decide on the worst possible update that could reasonably happen (i.e. they'd never release ""Plague"" or ""Edible Zoo Keepers""). Presenting:

# Flora Frenzy

Have you mastered happy animals and guests? Now try plants! This mandatory update adds realistic flora to all zoos. With the new Groundskeeper profession, you'll be able to grow, tend and replant all plants in your zoo with ease. The Soil Acidity overlay will show you the best places to germinate each species, while the Climate updates will ensure realistic planting of species suited to your zoo's location. Rain is more important than ever, as plants that are too thirsty - or too saturated - won't survive even the best Groundskeeper attention. Just make sure to get rid of dead plants fast - your guests won't like those!

\- Start all plants from seeds in your Greenhouse, transplant them, and watch them grow! Trees take between 5-30 years to reach full height.

\- Watch that sunlight! Some bushes, flowers and grasses prefer partial to full shade, while others need sun all the time.

\- Add all new tarp assets to cover plants that are getting too much water, and add sprinklers to satisfy thirst in drier climates. Just don't add too many - sprinklers will detract from your eco score!

\- Groundskeepers can trim unsightly plants and pull weeds. Make sure all plants are accessible by your staff or face the consequences.

\- Uh Oh, Ginko! Watch carefully whether you're planting male or female trees, or your guests' Allergy Ratings will suffer!

\- We've added our most requested change to date: finally a use for all that manure! Keepers will move droppings to the new Compost hut, where Groundskeepers can mix it with other nutrients for that perfect PH/Nitrogen balance. (Once you research it, coffee grounds can be gathered from Fox to boost your yields!) Caretakers can then carry it to the right locations with the new wheelbarrow tool!

\- Need to move a bush or flower? No problem! You can schedule your Groundskeepers to dig them up and direct them to where you'd like it replanted. You can also research the Truck option to move small planted trees, or the Super Digger for larger ones. Just keep an eye on the Root Growth tab - move a plant too often and its chance of death will rise dramatically.

\- Plant a vegetable garden for your restaurants. Use expensive, environmentally-damaging chemicals to increase their production, or go the rainwater, natural insect route to keep yields and footprints small.

\- Focus on your indoor habitats for all animals outside of your current biome - their plants will thank you. (Or not grow.)

1h5pv0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h5pv0b/how/,How?,"How did I do this to myself, daily, for YEARS. And that’s not even an exaggeration.

For the first time in the 215 days that I’ve been sober (besides the first few days of detox), I only got a couple hours of sleep (due to travel). 

I feel so weighed-down today having to force myself out of bed to go to work. This heavy tiredness is so reminiscent of how I spent every single day of my life while I was drinking. But back then I’d tag on the doom-inducing anxiety, the bleary hangover fog, and physical pain, especially in my gut. I’d be shaky and jumpy, with bouts of vertigo whether I was sitting down or trying to go up and down the steps. It was honestly so miserable and I was so unhappy.

It was an actual living hell trying to function every day. Sometimes I swear my anxiety was a force that pushed me to get through my days. It was like an adrenaline. I was always so nervous about being a screw up that I forced myself to act okay and worked harder because I felt like I was compensating for the guilt I had about my own drinking. I always had this feeling everyone knew - and they probably did. And because of that, I forced myself every single day. I can still remember the feeling of stress that caused me both physically and mentally. A deeply, intense exhaustion. 

I don’t know how the stress didn’t kill me tbh.

Right now, all I probably need is a coffee and some food to feel better. God forbid I added coffee to the picture before. God knows I couldn’t force down food.

Today, I am so damn thankful to be sober. I’m so thankful for this reminder. I’m thankful to reflect back on what I no longer have to suffer through. 

This new life is totally worth it. And I’ll keep telling myself that whenever I’m having a hard time.

The smell at their house is so overwhelming that when we leave, we have to air out our things and wash everything several times. It seems the mold must be in the pipes because anything you try to clean - your hair, Tupperware etc, it becomes very smelly and it's nearly impossible to get the odor out. They have their carpets cleaned and it remains soaking wet for several days so I'm sure they also have mold in their subfloors. The rest of the family and friends talk about the smell. When they visit us, my family comments to me how badly our house begins to smell from it and we have to use lots of baking soda, lysol, open windows for days, etc to try to clear the smell. It's quite embarrassing but also concerning because they have a lot of medical issues that seem to stem from the mold. It's becoming more severe that I dread seeing them because if we are around them, the odor seems to cling to us as well and it's difficult to get rid of it. If they make food, the food they bring over smells and tastes like the bad odor in their home. A family member once tried to tell them about their concern and they got yelled at essentially.

1h5pp5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1h5pp5b/why_was_my_girlfriend_of_2_years_hiding_talking/,Why was my girlfriend of 2+ years hiding talking to her ex?,"My girlfriend (28) and I (M31) have been together for over 2 years. We met in my country and later moved to her country where I speak the language fluently and have lived in this region for the better part of a decade, so despite being from two different countries/ cultures, we immediately meshed quite well even initially (we moved in together on the first date).

I've never been the jealous type and have only had 3 serious relationships up to this point: my first girlfriend, my ex-wife, and my now girlfriend, who is pregnant with our child. Apart from those I have had dozens of casual encounters that we just hooking up during my college and early professional years, with the occasional FWB here and there. I've always been more laid back about this and if someone is not interested or wanting to fully commit, it's their choice and I'm not going to be jealous about their own wants/ desires. What gets me is when in the past more regular FWBs or serious relationships would lie or deliberately obscure the truth, whether due to apprehension about my potential reaction or because they were in-fact lying/ unfaithful.

I have never cheated on any of my serious relationships emotionally or otherwise as this does not meld with my fundamental value system of integrity and respect. I have also been completely open with all of my serious relationships/ FWBs/ hookups letting them know how the cards stand and what I am interested in. I have never been broken up with before, not saying it as a badge of honor, just that I have always been the one that ended things for one reason or another, so I don't know what it feels like to be broken up with. 

As mentioned, I've spent the past few years living in her country, have gotten to know her parents (wonderful people), her friend and professional group, etc. From the first date really we just kind of meshed and found each other's company quite complementary on many different levels: physical, intellectually, same value structures, etc.

I've never asked about her past or exes and she has not asked about mine, as we just never really cared and didn't present any issues or come up much if at all in conversation. I'd say in all other facets of our relationship things are excellent including communication, sex life, finances, complementary careers, etc.

About a year ago, a mutual acquaintance we later found out was attempting to suck me into a ponzy scheme, and when I let them know that my girlfriend and I had discussed and that it would not be a viable investment option for OUR family, they went off about her and dropped the names of two of her exes, both of which are semi-prominent public figures and also happen to be brothers. Their infantile manipulation tactic was to isolate me from my girlfriend in a foreign country, become my confidant, and trying to steal as much of my money as they could, which directly makes me mistrust any claims they made about anything (she was meeting him in secret, cheating on me, ""run-through,"" etc.).

All that my girlfriend had really revealed up to this point about her past was that she never had a public facing relationship (her friend groups had independently confirmed to me she had never ""dated"" anyone before). Additionally, she had not ever given off a promiscuous vibe and was more of a ""good girl"" type that early on stated she ""did not date people,"" and if we were together seriously or public facing she would want to marry and have children. She had only had FWBs up to this point, all of which had been her bosses.

At the beginning of our relationship we had a condom break, and she proceeded to reveal to me in bed that she had miscarried one of her exes' child, and what a terrible person they had been when she revealed the pregnancy, told her to f**k off and abort it. She ended up miscarrying in the office where he was her boss.

She had invited him to a barbecue earlier on when I first arrived in the country at her parents' house under the auspice that she needed the guy to help her father with a legal concern, but failed to mention that he was one of her former bosses with whom she had a relationship, and whose child she miscarried. By the way, I want to reinforce the fact that I have truly not ever been the jealous type, she has had male friends, and we have never once had this issue arise. When I think back to this day I realize she was standoffish with physical affection with me around him and had spent a lot of time that morning getting ready and doing her makeup. Yes, it makes me feel like a fool in retrospect.

It was this ex during the whole time and right before we got together that she had also actively been commenting and liking posts on social media, texting, and quite blatantly even on public facing social media trying to win the attention from by offering to go for a walk with our dog, assist with a request he had posted online. She posted a selfie with the dog just revealing her lips and the dog face, I'm not blind and have had plenty of FWB's who likewise would communicate with me in this playful flirtatious way. His public request she was also standoffish about and really I feel had been trying to do herself, again as a means by which to interact with him and gain his attention since, to him it was clear she was nothing more than his annual rotation of young 20-something interns.

When I asked her about this the same day the acquaintance revealed the identity, we were sitting in bed and she kind of had an ""oh s**t"" moment when I just told her exactly what had happened and how the acquaintance had said she was cheating on me with him. Of course, I don't think this was the case based on his known intentions, however, it has left me rubbed the wrong way even a year later. It's not that she had this relationship or that anything happened, but how she actively hid it from me and continued the communciation with him the way she did during our entire relationship.

The topic is unable to be broached, despite our otherwise stellar communication including never really even getting into arguments. She basically says to me, ""I chose you. This is not going to work for me if you keep brining this up.""
She denies that she had anything other than the intention of having him help her father, but the way she went about this is quite painful and devastating to me because she omitted the truth on purpose, and it's still not blatantly clear to me why because I would not have cared. I feel in my gut that there is more to it than she has let on, especially due to the fact that now she does not interact with him on social media anymore at all, nor do I ever see any more messages pop up from him in passing. I'm not reading her phone, never have violated her privacy in any way, but I'm talking about when you sit in bed scrolling you will show people your phone and notifications pop up for example. I'd seen his name before but never since then has it appeared.

Why would she cut off any social media activity with him after this happened, if in fact there was nothing to it? Why will she refuse to discuss it further and immediately become defensive when I calmly broach the subject, flipping immediately to something out of left field to accuse me of doing wrong? I'm not ignorant to this form of emotional manipulation and it saddens me to see her employing it as I get the feeling it means she doesn't want to really discuss the issue honestly with me.

I feel like I've been played like a complete fool, and that for a large portion of our relationship she's kept me with this guy as an option on deck, whom she likely was texting the entire time and god only knows what. On top of that, they live in our city as semi-prominent public figures and I have to run into them infrequently.

Additionally, all of her friends who knew about it the whole time I can't bear to even see or be around now, as I am certain they look at me as a complete fool as well who was to be the stupid idiot ignorant of what was happening. One of her girlfriends I know was laughing all day long with her husband about the stupid foreigner not knowing the truth. As you can see, yes this brings out feelings of jealousy and insecurity in me that I really do not like to feel, as I've never had this occur in my life really before like this, and I am not sure what to do anymore.

I have his phone number and want to invite him for a cup of coffee to ask what the hell had been going on since I understand I will never hear the full truth from her, but I am worried I will not like what I hear from him. I've pictured even meeting him, and getting him to write her a note to ask to meet and see if she does it and doesn't say anything to me about it.

How do I resolve this other than asking her directly, again, for the third time, which I certainly do not want to do during her pregnancy to add any unnecessary stress. I think about it pretty much daily and get in a very bad space mentally when I do. I've also played out the scenario in my head of asking her to show me her texts with him.

1h5pn5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1h5pn5k/doing_engagement_photos_a_month_or_2_before/,Doing engagement photos a month or 2 before wedding?,"Hello! My wedding is in the early summer of 2025. 

I’m a bit stressed about the engagement photos. I got engaged end of last year and was not in the mindset to get photos done as we didn’t even have a photographer yet. The year has been so busy and although I secured a venue earlier this year I didn’t start really planning the wedding until September. I spend the past few months juggling work and hiring vendors (clearly I was very late to this as so many were already booked). 

Once we hired the photographer I immediately moved onto hair, makeup, DJ etc which took a lot of time (both to choose and to book because so many of their response times were slow and a few vendors even ghosted me after taking a while to reply to initial email but still told me they’re available for my day! And then ghosted after I emailed back. This has happened like 3 times lol. 

That’s another rant for another day though, but the delay contributed to my stress and not prioritizing engagement photos. 

My photographers package comes with engagement photos so I can’t just skip them all together. I’m located in Toronto. At this point though it’s so cold outside, the leaves have fallen and trees are dead, and dry winter skin is no joke. Christmas is around the corner too. 

**I am wondering, at this point should I just schedule the photos for the spring?**

I have no desire for winter-themed photos whatsoever and whenever I see engagement pics taken inside of a photo studio, they feel so artificial to me. I wanted to have photos taken outside on city streets with beautiful architecture behind me, maybe even sitting at a coffee shop or something. We are very much city people so taking photos in the great outdoors isn’t our vibe either. I also don’t want to be wearing winter coats in our photos because the wedding is very-summer themed. 

So my concerns now are:

1. If I do this, what is the point of the photos? For a late June wedding I would want to send the invites out in March and I thought the engagement photos would live on the wedding RSVP website

2. I don’t want to take the photos in early March because of two reasons: firstly because it’s still very winters in Toronto at that time of year and secondly, we come back from a month long trip to Asia at the start of March so I’m pretty sure it’s going to take some time for us to lose the weight we gained on the trip and flush the water retention from our faces as well lol. We are foodies so we will be eating a lot and so we need a month at least to return to healthy eating before we are willing to have our photos taken - I know this sounds superficial but we want the photos to reflect us feeling good in our bodies and we’d be disappointed if we look puffy from a month of salty and heavy food. 

So if we take the photos sometime in April, is there even a point? The invites will have already be sent so photos won’t be on website unless we upload them later, nor will they be on the invitations. 

So I need opinions please! Do you recommend we wait until spring which feels like a huge weight lifted from our shoulders? Or do we suck it up and take photos sooner in a studio and just be done with it?

Thank you in advance, I am a stressed out bride lol (this is merely one issue that’s stressing me out). ",1,1733238792.0,weddingplanning,6,1.0,False

Am I misremembering?  Has nutritional science changed- er - advanced again?  Or maybe, my little peptide friends have some magical ability to make hydrolyzed stuff good again?  Especially when it gets into my creaky joints?  I just want to enjoy one of my last remaining vices, so I’ve got to know.

I've been researching agencies for my new picture book, ""No!"", and when I found a 30-year-old boutique agency called the CAT Agency, well, I had to get in touch. I'm an author only, but the illustrations on your site jumped off the (web)page like a tabby chasing a laser pointer. I hope you enjoy my submission as much as I enjoyed your lookbook. 

“No!” (350 words) is a humorous children’s picture book about a strong-willed girl who loves to say “NO!”. The book's intended audience is children ages 4 - 6, and the manuscript was written to fit within the standard 36-page format. Comps for “No!” Are “No, David!” and “The Pigeon Needs a Bath.”

Let’s eat breakfast. No! Let’s take a bath. No! Please get dressed. No! A strong-willed child can be challenging, but a strong will can also change the world. “No!” follows a young girl and her sister - the narrator, through her life, where the reader discovers that saying No! and standing up for what you believe can be amazingly kind and brave. Just ask the aliens in the book who try to steal the world's pizza supply only to be met with a defiant No!

Daniel is a father, Floridian, and author who lives in St. Pete with his wife and two daughters. He is a member of SCBWI and has been a storyteller since he could write. He wrote video scripts and short stories before jumping into children’s books. Daniel also enjoys photography, trail running, and drinking coffee by the pool.

I've always been a average looking person, average size, and never the one who got her coffee paid for ever. 

I still managed to date twice despite that and have a fairly decent number of proposals coming in for an arranged marriage. 

Problem is due to my treatments, I grew fat, like, really fat to the point I had to buy new clothes fat. I find it extremely hard to make peace with the fact that I now look like this. 

I don't know, I just can't bring myself to socialize, forget dating and letting people come to see me. I also hate how people treat you when you're relatively decent to look at vs when you're fat. This includes friends and family. Nobody spares you and definitely everyone makes sure they remind you of the calories you're consuming. This fuels me to change, but the people who know why I have landed here still taunt me, I don't expect strangers to treat me well either. 

How do I change my mindset about this? How do I not let it affect me? Also, are there any kind of treatments for body dysmorphia? 

I'm sorry if this was triggering, and please don't come for me, this is just my reality and I am unable to cope up with it. To the point where I feel I am developing eating disorders.

This will go on and on until I’ve wasted too many beans to continue.

My thing is the Sculptor is supposed to be a ZERO retention machine. So why am I chasing my tail when dialling new coffee!!????

I’m starting to think there’s something wrong with my grinder, after all it was a start up, maybe I should sell and invest in something more established?

Dear god please help me before I throw grinder through a window

1h5p7hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraKaffe/comments/1h5p7hm/milk_chiller_suggestion/,Milk Chiller Suggestion ,"Hi! Totally a novelty request, but would you guys consider implementing a milk chiller accessory for the TK-02? Jura offers a milk chiller add-on that allows users to brew milk-based drinks directly from their phones without needing to set up the milk supply beforehand. While it’s not a necessity, I think it would be a convenient and appealing accessory. I’ve even considered adapting the Jura chiller for use with my TK-02, but it wouldn’t match the minimalist aesthetic—not to mention Jura’s $300 price tag for the chiller. It seems like a relatively simple addition that could be a great upgrade for those making coffee in a rush.

Just to outline the simplicity, I assume it could be done with something like a Peltier cooling pad around a dishwasher-safe metal container, plus an insulated tube leading to the brew head. It could even use the same attachment method already on the TK-02. Of course, I’m no engineer, and I’m sure some software tweaks would be needed to make it work, but it feels like a cool idea!

For my west coast Illumineers, you've got some morning coffee content and my East Coast team, we've got something to watch before we hit our lunch!



First up, we've got s4iler vs Theo. This will be interesting because s4iler's hand sisu and brawl's aren't going to do much for him here. Where he doesn't have his quill, he also loses that early Be Prep. There's still lots of options though, early tala for trading, Maui that can come in with rush and stick around to answer more things because Theo doesn't have a lot of high attack. It also means that an early half-shark can offer a lot of utility to get multiple actions back. Does s4iler just ramp for board wipe then control after or will he be able to do enough taking tempo back?

Next up we will see some NalaSong coming in with Bivens facing off against Buonaserrra's burn deck. Historically, SteelSong is favored into this MU. The ability to just go super wide before and after Be Prep is never what burn wants to see. With Gastons over shift lines, Bivens knows he can keep Gaston and Wheel in hand as well and guarantee that he gets his wheel t4 and goes super wide t5/t6. 

Some intense matches today. Always excited to see how RB navigates their lines against Agro, especially this ward list he is up against. Meanwhile, watching Purple decks run their lines always makes for a good match as well. Let's go NA!!

1h5p1y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbrahamHicks/comments/1h5p1y7/impulse_doubt/,Impulse doubt,"I really believe in impulses and I usually get them at random times. When they happen, I believe that I was at the right place at the right time to see/hear/think of some information that brought me the impulse. 

Now, a few weeks ago I saw an ad for a cafe in my city that was advertised as digital-nomad-friendly. I'm a freelancer so I visited today. It's such a cute little place and the atmosphere is very nice. 

I overheard a conversation between the owner (I suppose so, they were the server and there was no one else there) and their friend (who came in and got a cup of coffee. They were talking about wanting to close because they weren't making enough money, the rent was expensive etc. 

I felt bad because I really like the concept of the cafe and I think they really put a lot of thought into it. On my way out, I had an impulse to offer my help but I chickened out because I didn't want it to seem like I was eavesdropping or like I was trying to pitch myself for something. 

So on my way home, I was thinking of ways to do this nicely. I don't know the owner, this was my first time there and I thought about telling them how I could help, how we could strengthen their social media presence, host community events, things like that - just off the top of my head. 

Now, I'm not an expert at this, I'm in digital operations management, but I always wanted to run my own small cafe and strategically grow it. And I see this as an opportunity to do so, research the field, get some experience for myself and also try to help them, because I felt so good there and I really love the concept and the idea. I want to do it all as a volunteer, of course, not looking to get paid. 

But then, when I got home, I started doubting myself. Even though they got nothing to lose, maybe they'll just say no and maybe it's too late and they're not interested. I took a look at their Instagram and they've got a pretty nice page, I'm not sure if I could make a huge impact on its improvement. Not sure where this doubt is coming from, but I still think they could use a pair of fresh hands on board. 

So, what does everybody think? I understand that the doubt is probably coming from my imposter syndrome but maybe it's an impulse to not do it. Trying to think rationally here, but also stay in my vortex. ",3,1733237285.0,AbrahamHicks,0,1.0,False

The incident happened back when I was a kid. My parents were at a high-school reunion all day so I invited my friend Jason to hang out with me in the backyard. We did a bunch of silly stuff like using sticks as swords and pretending to be superheroes. It's a bit embarrassing to admit since we were already in 6th grade at the time, but that's the fun of being a kid. You're always living in the moment and doing whatever you feel like. I was so caught up in having fun that I didn't notice my cat Frisky getting up to trouble like usual. He always had a knack for climbing up tall places.

Bookshelves. Fridges. Tree branches. He went anywhere his paws would take him.

This time Frisky decided he wanted to venture further beyond my house. I didn't realize Frisky had climbed up my backyard fence until Jason alerted me at the last second. I caught a brief glimpse of the devious shorthair feline standing on top of the fence before leaping on the other side.

Panic immediately consumed me. There were a lot of close calls before, but this was the first time Frisky ran away from home. I told Jason to stay in the backyard in case Frisky came back while I went searching for him. Since I lived in a brownstone house in Brooklyn, my neighbor's house was actually on the opposite side of the city block. I took off jogging down the block until I ended up in front of the house that was parallel to mine. I gave the doorbell a ring a few times, but the owner never came to answer.

This made me even more restless so I did something I knew I'd regret later. The latest summer heat meant that many people kept their windows open and this guy was no different. It was my luck that the window didn't have a screen protector.

This was an incredibly risky move on my part, but I feared that Frisky would end up running away if I didn't find him in time. No way was I going to wait for 911 to do something about it.

I hastily made my way inside, rushing past the living room and kitchen until I reached the backyard. It was a wild garden of overgrown plants and unkempt items. Finding Frisky was much like searching for a needle in a haystack. I couldn't even call out for him because that would've alerted the homeowner. Who knows how many minutes I spent looking for that cat. Every second felt like an eternity. At any moment I could've been caught by the homeowner and have the police called on me.

Or even worse. It was a pretty rough neighborhood. It wasn't uncommon for someone to shoot an intruder on sight regardless of how little danger they posed. Human life was just that cheap to some people. 

As if my prayers were answered, a soft string of meows came to life. I quickly followed the source of that familiar voice and found Frisky hiding underneath a table at the far end of the yard. There were so many weeds and clutter surrounding the table that it took me a while to spot Frisky. I scooped him up and gave him a great big hug. I was relieved to finally have my friend back. 

I rushed through the house and was about to make my exit when I bumped into a coffee table and knocked over a scrapbook to the ground. Several pictures went sliding across the floor. Not wanting to leave behind any evidence I was ever there, I hurriedly began putting the photos back in place. As I was putting everything away, one of the photos caught my eye.

It was a picture of a young redheaded boy with freckles and a yellow hoodie. I recognized it instantly. It was Jordan Cambell.

He was a boy who went missing in my neighborhood a few months back. His missing posters were hung pretty much everywhere you looked. In the photo, Jordan seemed to be walking the streets alone with a hand stretching out to reach him. I opened up the scrapbook to see countless photos of young boys taken from several angles. Some featured kids playing in the park or the pool. The camera was uncomfortably zoomed in on their chests and legs. I almost dropped to the floor when I saw one picture at the very bottom of the page.

It was me, getting changed in my bedroom window. It was taken late at night and my bare chest was exposed from the side.

A heavy pair of footsteps came from upstairs and they seemed to be approaching the stairs. I tucked the picture into my pocket and took off running with Frisky in my hands. I ran like hell all the way back home. My heart was on the verge of bursting from my chest the entire time.

Jason immediately saw something was wrong from the way I was sweating with a thousand-yard stare on my face. I told him it was nothing and tried playing it cool until he went home.

As soon as my parents came back, I spilled the entire story with tears in my eyes. They didn't even have time to be mad at me for breaking into someone's house because I showed them the picture of me in the window. I'll never forget seeing the color drain from their faces while their mouths hung open.

The events after that all just blurred together. I remember getting questioned by police and having to go to a court hearing. Apparently my neighbor, named Larry Samchez, was a serial killer with an obsession with kids. He abducted them throughout the years and would horrifically butcher them into pieces. Some of the remains were kept in the basement while others were stored in the backyard. I could've very really been the next victim on Larry's kill list. I guess I should be grateful to Frisky. I never would've found any of this out had he stayed home. Sometimes a little curiosity just might save your life.

Hey, I've been working on a payments-focused fintech idea and could really use some help from folks who've been down this road.

The thing is, bootstrapping in fintech is proving way tougher than I initially thought. Between the RBI licenses, regulatory approvals, and all the capital requirements, it's pretty intense for a solo founder. I've got the technical side figured out, but the regulatory maze is... well, let's just say it's interesting 😅

I'm specifically looking for:
1. Someone who can walk me through the current state of the Indian payments market
2. Intros to people/funds who actively invest in early-stage fintech (especially payments)

Would really appreciate if you could connect me with anyone in your network who's deep in the Indian fintech space.

Also if from bangalore we can meet over a coffee chat next week to discuss what I have been working on.

Since I lived in a brownstone house in Brooklyn, my neighbor's house was actually on the opposite side of the city block. I took off jogging down the block until I ended up in front of the house that was parallel to mine. I gave the doorbell a ring a few times, but the owner never came to answer.

This made me even more restless so I did something I knew I'd regret later. The latest summer heat meant that many people kept their windows open and this guy was no different. It was my luck that the window didn't have a screen protector.

This was an incredibly risky move on my part, but I feared that Frisky would end up running away if I didn't find him in time. No way was I going to wait for 911 to do something about it.

I hastily made my way inside, rushing past the living room and kitchen until I reached the backyard. It was a wild garden of overgrown plants and unkempt items. Finding Frisky was much like searching for a needle in a haystack. I couldn't even call out for him because that would've alerted the homeowner. Who knows how many minutes I spent looking for that cat. Every second felt like an eternity. At any moment I could've been caught by the homeowner and have the police called on me.

Or even worse. It was a pretty rough neighborhood. It wasn't uncommon for someone to shoot an intruder on sight regardless of how little danger they posed. Human life was just that cheap to some people. 

As if my prayers were answered, a soft string of meows came to life. I quickly followed the source of that familiar voice and found Frisky hiding underneath a table at the far end of the yard. There were so many weeds and clutter surrounding the table that it took me a while to spot Frisky. I scooped him up and gave him a great big hug. I was relieved to finally have my friend back. 

I rushed through the house and was about to make my exit when I bumped into a coffee table and knocked over a scrapbook to the ground. Several pictures went sliding across the floor. Not wanting to leave behind any evidence I was ever there, I hurriedly began putting the photos back in place. As I was putting everything away, one of the photos caught my eye.

It was a picture of a young redheaded boy with freckles and a yellow hoodie. I recognized it instantly. It was Jordan Cambell.

He was a boy who went missing in my neighborhood a few months back. His missing posters were hung pretty much everywhere you looked. In the photo, Jordan seemed to be walking the streets alone with a hand stretching out to reach him. I opened up the scrapbook to see countless photos of young boys taken from several angles. Some featured kids playing in the park or the pool. The camera was uncomfortably zoomed in on their chests and legs. I almost dropped to the floor when I saw one picture at the very bottom of the page.

It was me, getting changed in my bedroom window. It was taken late at night and my bare chest was exposed from the side.

A heavy pair of footsteps came from upstairs and they seemed to be approaching the stairs. I tucked the picture into my pocket and took off running with Frisky in my hands. I ran like hell all the way back home. My heart was on the verge of bursting from my chest the entire time.

Jason immediately saw something was wrong from the way I was sweating with a thousand-yard stare on my face. I told him it was nothing and tried playing it cool until he went home.

As soon as my parents came back, I spilled the entire story with tears in my eyes. They didn't even have time to be mad at me for breaking into someone's house because I showed them the picture of me in the window. I'll never forget seeing the color drain from their faces while their mouths hung open.

The events after that all just blurred together. I remember getting questioned by police and having to go to a court hearing. Apparently my neighbor, named Larry Samchez, was a serial killer with an obsession with kids. He abducted them throughout the years and would horrifically butcher them into pieces. Some of the remains were kept in the basement while others were stored in the backyard. I could've very really been the next victim on Larry's kill list. I guess I should be grateful to Frisky. I never would've found any of this out had he stayed home. Sometimes a little curiosity just might save your life.

The incident happened back when I was a kid. My parents were at a high-school reunion all day so I invited my friend Jason to hang out with me in the backyard. We did a bunch of silly stuff like using sticks as swords and pretending to be superheroes. It's a bit embarrassing to admit since we were already in 6th grade at the time, but that's the fun of being a kid. You're always living in the moment and doing whatever you feel like. I was so caught up in having fun that I didn't notice my cat Frisky getting up to trouble like usual. He always had a knack for climbing up tall places.

Bookshelves. Fridges. Tree branches. He went anywhere his paws would take him.

This time Frisky decided he wanted to venture further beyond my house. I didn't realize Frisky had climbed up my backyard fence until Jason alerted me at the last second. I caught a brief glimpse of the devious shorthair feline standing on top of the fence before leaping on the other side.

Panic immediately consumed me. There were a lot of close calls before, but this was the first time Frisky ran away from home.

1h5osyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1h5osyi/how_i_ruined_my_relationship/,How I ruined my relationship,"So a quick intro. I am not blaming my actions on trauma. I am simply connecting the dots and understanding why I acted the way I acted and understanding all the resentment I felt towards myself. My therapist suggested that it might be CPTSD and I came to open up, share my situation and hope for some unbiased insight.  
  
It's been a turbulent past few months, generally life has been pretty difficult work has been stressful and I struggled with some of my own issues. In the past month I messed up a serious relationship, something that should have lasted forever, something that was set in stone with somebody I loved more than life itself and planned my entire life around.

During these few weeks that we've been a part I've been attending therapy pretty regularly unpacking a lot of stuff I was aware of, but repressing. A lot of my upbringing has been riddled with abuse and it has now become clear that I am definitely coming from complex trauma. 

Only child from a divorced couple, I have been living with my mother since I was three years old and for a big part of that the living situation was also with the rest of my family. So grandmother, grandfather, aunt, my mother and I were all living in one of big apartment and I had a pretty good childhood if you were to ask me a few months ago. However right now I can see that it wasn't that great after all. While I always had everything I could wish for in the material sense, I was emotionally neglected, emotionally abused and my needs were put aside. I learned to put on my mask and serve my family to the best of my ability even though that was never enough. I was never enough and every accomplishment I made was met with disapproval, critique and just general dismissal of my achievements. 

They always treated me like I was lesser to them because I was the youngest and that was always their argument: ""You're younger you should do this, you should listen to us we're older we know what's good for you. We know better because we are older"". 

That led to me just always feeling inadequate and always feeling unsatisfied with myself. I always felt like a failure and I always felt like a burden to to other people. The only relationships I had in my life were either insignificant or ended with my trust being broken. 

Fast forward to a year and a half ago I met this incredible girl, this incredible woman and I fell in love so fast and we were perfect for one another We clicked so fast and we planned a life. We got some pets and then we start living together. Earlier in life, I was so emotionally drained and dead from trying to be perfect, so in need of feeling something that I resorted to pornography, developed an addiction which only escalated to chatting with anonymous women online in ways that are far beyond appropriate. Of course, once it reached that point, it was never about the addiction. It was a whole new thing, a whole new unhealthy escape from reality. The first occurence was a year ago where I opened up the anonymous chat on reddit and then immediately closed it down because I felt shame and disgust. And now a month back we had a pretty rough period where I had pretty big self-esteem issues, I thought I wasn't enough, I worked for 20 hours a day, my libido was non-existent and I constantly felt like I was going to lose her. 

And then for two weeks straight I did nothing but actively work on losing her. I was on reddit. I talked to women inappropriately however it didn't bring me joy, it didn't bring me satisfaction or any pleasure. I was just escaping and trying to fill the emptiness that was inside of me. As soon as my phone was down my entire focus was on making her happy. I enjoyed making her pancakes, making her coffee, sending her coffee and breakfast to her workplace. Sleeping beside her was the best thing I ever felt she cured my insomnia she cured my sleep paralysis and I threw it all away because I wasn't able to open up and talk to her, because I was chasing a high in ways I never should have.

When she saw the chats she kicked me out of the house and that ws it. In the coming days we saw each other a couple of times out of necessity when I was picking up my stuff.

I decided to turn my life around, and I know changes don't happen overnight but what I know is that she is my person that I deeply hurt her, I deeply hurt her trust. I know that I'm going to work day and night to rebuild it and to regain it as long as she will allow it. She has been furious, she has been angry, she said she hated me. Things have calmed down in the meantime and she is showing signs that she cares about me still. We will see each other on occasion, she's offering to help me financially since I now moved into an apartment that is way above my pay grade. 

But that doesn't matter because I'm going to work two jobs, three jobs if necessary. I'm going to show commitment and I'm going to follow through on being a better person because I need to be a better better person for myself. That does not diminish the fact, either, that I am doing it to be the man that she deserves. 

She's constantly asking me if I really believe I can be what she needs., if I really believe I can do this. That gives me hope but I'm also so terrified, I'm terrified that the no contact and the space that I'm giving her to heal and to process everything will lead to her shutting down. I'm terrified that she is gonna lose emotions I'm terrified that I killed the part of her that wanted kids with me. I'm terrified that I killed a part of her that loved me. I know what the consequences are, I'm feeling them right now and the chances are pretty solid that I'm gonna feel them for the rest of my life. 

I'm doing my best to show her that I'm here for her, that I'm going to follow through on my promises. I'm going to help her out financially with some things we went into together I took one of our pets off her hands so it's easier for her. I will be there for any small or big thing that she needs me for.

Everyday if I'm not at work, I'm in therapy. If I'm not in therapy, I'm reading books. If I'm not reading books, I'm watching videos and if I'm not watching videos I'm journaling. When evening comes I do my darndest to distract myself and to indulge in hobbies to feel good about myself, to connect with myself and to find distractions in healthy habits rather than unhealthy ones.

I'm learning to love myself so that I can love her again.

I'm not looking for excuses for what I did because there aren't any. I cheated on her and I consciously made the decision to cheat on her for two weeks straight. I know it's not any sort of consolation but I would never go past that I would never bring anybody into our bed, I would never go out of my way behind her back to physically or emotionally connect with someone. However, trust is trust, and I broke it.

My trauma is not something that I'm using as a way out to justify what I did. It is just something that I realized that helped me build a completely unhealthy relationship with myself in life. It is something that I'm working on day and night I'm making rapid changes anger homing as fast as I can I just hope she'll be here to see it.",2,1733236600.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

So, let me tell you about the day I met $Apecape. I was sitting at home, scrolling through endless Reddit threads about crypto, and BAM—there it was: ApeWifCape. I thought, What kind of ridiculous name is that? Naturally, I clicked. Little did I know this little monkey token would change my life forever.

The Day It All Began

It started with a late-night trade. I had just eaten an entire pizza by myself, staring at my screen, thinking, Why not? I swapped a small amount of SOL for $Apecape and went to bed. That night, I had the strangest dream.

In my dream, a massive ape wearing a superhero cape burst into my apartment. He flexed his biceps, threw bananas everywhere, and yelled, “HODL, my dude! Together, we moon!”

The Unlikely Friendship

I woke up to see my $Apecape balance up 10x (I’m not saying the dream was magic, but…). From that moment on, I started seeing $Apecape everywhere. My morning coffee? The foam looked like a monkey face. My neighbor’s dog? Wearing a red cape. Coincidence? I think not.

How $Apecape Saved My Life

A week later, I was walking down the street, and a random flyer flew into my face. It said: “Life is bananas, buy $Apecape.” Distracted, I tripped over a curb, narrowly avoiding a speeding bike messenger. The irony? The messenger was carrying a crate of—you guessed it—bananas.

I swear, $Apecape has been watching over me ever since.

Why You Need $Apecape in Your Life

I could keep telling you stories about how $Apecape turned my life into a sitcom, but here’s the bottom line: this token isn’t just a meme, it’s a lifestyle. ApeWifCape is there for you in ways no other crypto ever could. Financial gains? Sure. Spiritual guidance? Absolutely. Random monkey dreams? A bonus.

Don’t just take my word for it. Join the $Apecape family, and maybe, just maybe, a superhero ape will appear in your dreams too.

HODL tight, friends. It’s bananas from here on out. 🍌

In the past month I messed up a serious relationship, something that should have lasted forever, something that was set in stone with somebody I loved more than life itself and planned my entire life around.

During these few weeks that we've been a part I've been attending therapy pretty regularly unpacking a lot of stuff I was aware of, but repressing. A lot of my upbringing has been riddled with abuse and it has now become clear that I am definitely coming from complex trauma. 

Only child from a divorced couple, I have been living with my mother since I was three years old and for a big part of that the living situation was also with the rest of my family. So grandmother, grandfather, aunt, my mother and I were all living in one of big apartment and I had a pretty good childhood if you were to ask me a few months ago. However right now I can see that it wasn't that great after all. While I always had everything I could wish for in the material sense, I was emotionally neglected, emotionally abused and my needs were put aside. I learned to put on my mask and serve my family to the best of my ability even though that was never enough. I was never enough and every accomplishment I made was met with disapproval, critique and just general dismissal of my achievements. 

They always treated me like I was lesser to them because I was the youngest and that was always their argument: ""You're younger you should do this, you should listen to us we're older we know what's good for you. We know better because we are older"". 

That led to me just always feeling inadequate and always feeling unsatisfied with myself. I always felt like a failure and I always felt like a burden to to other people. The only relationships I had in my life were either insignificant or ended with my trust being broken. 

Fast forward to a year and a half ago I met this incredible girl, this incredible woman and I fell in love so fast and we were perfect for one another We clicked so fast and we planned a life. We got some pets and then we start living together. Earlier in life, I was so emotionally drained and dead from trying to be perfect, so in need of feeling something that I resorted to pornography, developed an addiction which only escalated to chatting with anonymous women online in ways that are far beyond appropriate. Of course, once it reached that point, it was never about the addiction. It was a whole new thing, a whole new unhealthy escape from reality. The first occurence was a year ago where I opened up the anonymous chat on reddit and then immediately closed it down because I felt shame and disgust. And now a month back we had a pretty rough period where I had pretty big self-esteem issues, I thought I wasn't enough, I worked for 20 hours a day, my libido was non-existent and I constantly felt like I was going to lose her. 

And then for two weeks straight I did nothing but actively work on losing her. I was on reddit. I talked to women inappropriately however it didn't bring me joy, it didn't bring me satisfaction or any pleasure. I was just escaping and trying to fill the emptiness that was inside of me. As soon as my phone was down my entire focus was on making her happy. I enjoyed making her pancakes, making her coffee, sending her coffee and breakfast to her workplace. Sleeping beside her was the best thing I ever felt she cured my insomnia she cured my sleep paralysis and I threw it all away because I wasn't able to open up and talk to her, because I was chasing a high in ways I never should have.

When she saw the chats she kicked me out of the house and that ws it. In the coming days we saw each other a couple of times out of necessity when I was picking up my stuff.

I decided to turn my life around, and I know changes don't happen overnight but what I know is that she is my person that I deeply hurt her, I deeply hurt her trust. I know that I'm going to work day and night to rebuild it and to regain it as long as she will allow it. She has been furious, she has been angry, she said she hated me. Things have calmed down in the meantime and she is showing signs that she cares about me still. We will see each other on occasion, she's offering to help me financially since I now moved into an apartment that is way above my pay grade. 

But that doesn't matter because I'm going to work two jobs, three jobs if necessary. I'm going to show commitment and I'm going to follow through on being a better person because I need to be a better better person for myself. That does not diminish the fact, either, that I am doing it to be the man that she deserves. 

She's constantly asking me if I really believe I can be what she needs., if I really believe I can do this. That gives me hope but I'm also so terrified, I'm terrified that the no contact and the space that I'm giving her to heal and to process everything will lead to her shutting down. I'm terrified that she is gonna lose emotions I'm terrified that I killed the part of her that wanted kids with me. I'm terrified that I killed a part of her that loved me. I know what the consequences are, I'm feeling them right now and the chances are pretty solid that I'm gonna feel them for the rest of my life. 

I'm doing my best to show her that I'm here for her, that I'm going to follow through on my promises. I'm going to help her out financially with some things we went into together I took one of our pets off her hands so it's easier for her. I will be there for any small or big thing that she needs me for.

Everyday if I'm not at work, I'm in therapy. If I'm not in therapy, I'm reading books. If I'm not reading books, I'm watching videos and if I'm not watching videos I'm journaling. When evening comes I do my darndest to distract myself and to indulge in hobbies to feel good about myself, to connect with myself and to find distractions in healthy habits rather than unhealthy ones.

I'm learning to love myself so that I can love her again.

I'm not looking for excuses for what I did because there aren't any. I cheated on her and I consciously made the decision to cheat on her for two weeks straight. I know it's not any sort of consolation but I would never go past that I would never bring anybody into our bed, I would never go out of my way behind her back to physically or emotionally connect with someone. However, trust is trust, and I broke it.

My trauma is not something that I'm using as a way out to justify what I did. It is just something that I realized that helped me build a completely unhealthy relationship with myself in life. It is something that I'm working on day and night I'm making rapid changes anger homing as fast as I can I just hope she'll be here to see it.",2,1733236279.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Photo 1 - Their public area: Clockwise

1. Lobby – very aesthetic but also very warm as it is not airconditioned plus it is also basically with the same room with their laundry business with has a dryer.

2. Landry – They offer laundry cheaply for a hotel. Its 130 per load, just wasn’t able to inquire how many kilo their load is.

3. Café – They have their own café. Didn’t go inside so no idea what they actually sell. But according to the guard they also served rice meals there.

Photos 2 to 10. This room is actually good for 4 as it has 2 double sized beds. Comes with a sofa, coffee table, actual table with chairs and a kitchenette but without any utensils.

1. Bed – comes with 2 pillows and 2 throw pillow each. Bed feels sturdy, ample support and does not make that “squeaky” sound. So physical activities are a go😉. Blankets are just think cloth and no duvets. It also came clean from UV light.

2. CATV comes with (what I think is) Amazon TV. So it has direct access to Prime and Netflix but you still need your own account. The UV shows that the remote for the cable has multiple “spots”. I guess this is the most used among the 3 remotes. And definitely needs some cleaning.

3. AC is digital window type and the filter is filthy as F

4. Both doors has multiple locks. And all doors have sealing strip at the bottom to prevent insect, sound or even air from getting in and out.

5. Mini fridge with freezer.

6. Closed basic closet

Photos 11 to 13 - Comfort room has all the basics. Warm shower, bidet, sink, vanity mirror, soap and built in shampoo dispenser. It also has its own windows and not exhaust fan.

Photo 14 - Laundry room. This is the answer if you were asking why I mentioned “both doors” in item number 3d. Its located between the room and comfort room. This and the multiple windows made me think that this was place was probably meant (or actually was once) to be an apartment and was just converted into a hotel.

Photo 15 - Pokemon go. Has an access to a nearby gym with 2 pokemons spawning periodically.

Photo 16 - Speed test result by Ookla

Photo 17 - booked the room via Agoda app. When I inquired how much their walk in rate, receptionist said they only accept online booking. Even if you walked in, they will still book via Oyo website.",2,1733235751.0,CebuHotelReviews,0,1.0,False
1h5ofmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h5ofmm/my_ex_best_friend_and_i_fell_off_and_im/,My ex best friend and I fell off and I'm contemplating telling her ex husband about her cheating on him ,"Me (f26) and my ex bff (f28) recently had a huge falling out over the month of November. A lot happened so buckle up because honestly, I don't know where to begin. We will start a few months back around august. Me and my ex fiancé (m28) split up because we were both extremely toxic towards each other. It was an 8 year long relationship. Not only was there physical violence, but emotional and mental abuse. I chose to split it off with him because I didn't want to keep repeating the cycle. My ex best friend at the time was not only with her husband but was messaging and fooling around with this other man from Tennessee. We'll call him D. Her husband knew about D, but was told not to worry about it many times. I personally told him just to keep an eye out because honestly, I don't trust it either, and we were both right. Sadly, I kept the secret because I thought she was my best friend. When she split it off with him she didn't tell him the actual reason why she was leaving. The reason she told was that she was leaving because she fell out of love with him and that she liked girls and was coming out of the closet. Obviously, that looked really bad on me.Considering I was her best friend and people pointed their fingers, thinking that I put her up to it or that I was f****** her. Which definitely wasn't the case. Around that time, I was still dealing with the loss of my ex fiance, which was slightly difficult considering it was a very trauma bonded, eight year long relationship. It's really hard and sometimes I would just miss the comfortability of him or just miss the fact that you know, things went the way that they did. Because after her and her husband split up, she was kicked out, and I had to take her in. So she lived with us from august to around october. I had to leave because after I had broken up with my ex fiancé, he became very aggressive, angry, stalking me and going through my things so I had to leave. So in that time frame of the couple of months she was living there, apparently they had become friends. I didn't really care too much about them being friends. What bothered me was her constant complaining about how he was acting. How ""he was eating her out of house and home"". How ""she is paying all of his bills"", ""she has to tell him what to do instead of him doing chores for himself"". I personally just asked to stop hearing about it as I already knew how he was. Her response was then to say stop bringing it up and I told her I wasn't the one bringing it up that it was her. The one always bringing it up, and I just wanted that book of my life to close.Fast forward to september. Since we both decided to leave our partners around the same time, we also decided that we would move in together because it would just be easier that way with the world that we're living in. We found a place, and in november, we were supposed to move in together. So that morning of november.First, we went to ingles to get some supplies.We were laughing having a great time we went and got coffee at starbucks and went to waffle house for breakfast. Everything seems totally fine and nonchalant. Well, after we were done eating breakfast, I saged the house and we were listening to music. Then we were both cutting up laughing. Having a good time, nothing was out of the ordinary until I had asked her if it was okay if my now boyfriend were to come over to help me build my bed frame. She said yes, as she didn't see a problem with it, and she was going to continue grabbing boxes. I said, okay.Just making sure, and let him come over to help me build my bed frame. Once we were done I got a text message from her saying that my ex fiance was on his way and to be ready. I didn't see that until he was already in front of my face. Screaming, yelling at me, calling me a red flag, a dirty w**** and other very rude and mean things. He was also getting up in my now boyfriends face, wanting him to know how bad of a person I was and that he was going to fight him because he had nothing left to lose. Had to get in between them because if I didn't, there would have been a physical altercation.My now boyfriend wasn't saying anything, and that's totally fine.He didn't want to continue or start more arguments with a ""man child"". I texted my ex friend telling her that I have words and she needs to come over now to talk. She said, ""I tried to tell him lol"". And that she was only packing her s***. I honestly got upset and was just like. What the hell happened? What did you say? Why would you say something?And why did you cause this whole thing to begin with? She really didn't have anything to say.Besides that, she was just trying to pack her stuff and that she didn't care what was going on and that it was none of her business. I gave up and just continued packing the rest of my stuff because there was at that point, no need to keep arguing with someone who obviously didn't care. Next day we are supposed to move all of our big furniture, so we needed help from our friends and a truck, and by the time I got there, they had already come to their own conclusions. Not only was my ex fiancé there
But the day prior we had confirmed with the police that he wouldn't be. Yes, because of the whole altercation, I had to call the police, because my ex fiancé started throwing all of my things in boxes out into the street, damaging property and stating that he would go to jail over a playstation five. My ex best friend even said to call the police because she at this point made the situation so bad that police had to be involved. Not only was my now boyfriend being yelled at by my ex friend, but my ex fiance was screaming and yelling at me while throwing out my property. And at that point once we were done moving, all of the big furniture and my friends giving me the cold shoulder, I left fast forward to that sunday. I'd written everything that I was feeling down in a book and went over to what was our apartment to talk with my ex best friend. I stated everything. I wanted to say that whatever was said it didn't matter anymore. What mattered the most is that she had caused an altercation, knowing that it could become very unsafe for not only me but others involved. And that friends don't do that to friends and her response was that she's not apologizing. That she didn't care honestly what happened to me.The only thing that she would be apologizing for was yelling. So I made the decision to not move in with her and to get my name taken off the lease on the fifth of november that week. Soon as I got back to the place I was staying at. I got a text from her stating that I needed to pay her four hundred and thirty seven dollars for november's rent. Which didn't make any sense? Considering november was already paid for by her boyfriend, the man she cheated on her husband with. Soon as I got my name taken off the lease. My now boyfriend had asked my ex. Friend, why she would say what she said?And what was said? Her response was am I going to pay November's rent? I honestly had no words the only thing I could muster up was you can take me to court. Now it's December, and I'm honestly happier than ever, but still have this weight on my chest because I haven't said anything about her secret. A part of me just wants to close this chapter and to move on, but it's a little bit difficult knowing the information that I do and knowing that her ex husband was never a bad guy.It was her the whole time. I honestly just wanted to get this all off my chest, as well as get a outsiders perspective on the situation that I was thrown into. Should I tell her ex-husband about her cheating, or should I just leave it and continue on with my life and let the truth come out on its own? ",0,1733235565.0,offmychest,3,0.33,False
1h5oekz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1h5oekz/the_man_strode_into_the_bustling_diner_like_he/,The man strode into the bustling diner like he owned the place,"and trailing behind him was a peculiar sight—a full-grown ostrich, its sleek feathers gleaming under the neon lights. The waitress, a sharp-eyed woman with a smirk that could cut glass, raised an eyebrow.

“What’ll it be?” she asked, pen poised over her notepad.

Without missing a beat, the man leaned back in his chair, exuding an air of mystery. “A hamburger, fries, and a Coke,” he said smoothly, before turning to his unlikely companion. “And you?”

The ostrich, who had an inexplicable air of sophistication, cocked its head. “I’ll have the same,” it said in a voice that was both confident and strange.

When the bill arrived—$9.40, to be exact—the man reached into his pocket. Without hesitation, he produced the exact amount, not a penny more, not a penny less.

The next day, they returned. Same order, same scene, same exact change pulled from the depths of his pocket. It became a routine—so routine, in fact, that the waitress stopped bothering to ask until one Friday night when the man broke the cycle.

“I’ll have a steak, baked potato, and a salad,” he declared, his voice carrying a touch of indulgence.

“Same,” echoed the ostrich, its tone unwavering.

When the check arrived—$32.62 this time—the man once again fished out the precise amount without so much as a second thought.

By now, the waitress’s curiosity was a live wire. She couldn’t hold back any longer. “Alright, mister,” she began, her voice dripping with intrigue. “What’s your secret? How do you always have the exact change?”

The man leaned forward, a glint of amusement in his eye. “Years ago, I stumbled upon an old lamp while cleaning out my attic. Turns out, it had a genie inside.”

“A genie?” she repeated, her skepticism tinged with fascination.

“Yep,” he said, his tone nonchalant. “Granted me two wishes. My first was that I’d always have the exact amount of money I needed for anything—be it a cup of coffee or a private jet.”

The waitress let out a low whistle. “Smart. Most people would just wish for a pile of cash.”

He shrugged, his expression sly. “Why settle for a pile when you can have a bottomless well?”

Her eyes narrowed. “And the ostrich? What’s its deal?”

The man’s smirk faltered, and he sighed, the weight of a decision made long ago hanging in the air. “My second wish,” he said, his voice tinged with regret, “was for a tall chick with a big ass and long legs who agrees with everything I say.”

We seemed to hit it off well and I got the impression of some mutual attraction. My mutual friend connected us thru text and we have a coffee date scheduled for this Saturday. 

I did a little bit of texting over the weekend, just making small talk and stuff. She definitely doesn’t seem to be a big texter, which is fine. I generally try to match the energy of the person. I didn’t text her much behind a few times in the evenings. But I also have to remember we only met once in person before I reached out thru text. 

We confirmed the date for coffee this Saturday but I don’t have a time/place set up:…Should I wait until mid week to confirm the time and place? 

I’m probably overthinking it, just don’t want to come across as clingy before the first date…I get text anxiety ",1,1733235489.0,dating,3,0.99,False

Nothing concerning. I’d been moving up doses every 4 weeks because the last two weeks of each dose always left me starving. I just took my first injection of 7.5 and it knocked me on my ass. Injection day had me tired (which is also normal for me) and then just some upset stomach most of Monday. But come Monday night, I couldn’t sit still. I had this pit in my stomach and uncontrollable liquid farts and nasty burps. I thought my stomach pain was just due to the buildup of gas and I just had to let it out for relief. I finally got to sleep around 4am after taking 4 pepto because that’s all I had on hand. Woke up at 7:30, stomach was a bit better but more liquid farts and rank burps. When I stood up, though, I needed to cough, but knew that if I did, something else would come up. I got on my hands and knees infront of the bowl and… up came everything I ate on Monday (which wasn’t much anyway). Why did I not digest anything? Everything I ate was mostly liquid. I had a protein coffee, yogurt, ramen, and a hot chocolate. Should I be concerned? Is this going to happen next week? At least my stomach has some relief for the moment, but what am I supposed to eat? I’m so used to forcing down food that it’s hard to tell what is good for me. ",1,1733235306.0,Zepbound,5,0.67,False

“Don’t worry about it.”



“My car wouldn’t start.”



They entered the living room, and she gestured for him to sit on a blue la-z-boy recliner. “I want to show you something,” she said. He sat on the edge of the recliner. From a drawer, she pulled out a well cared for Sig Sauer P365 and pointed it at him.



He didn’t flinch, and, instead, began laughing.



“Huh. Nobody has ever laughed before. All the others, they always got scared.”



“You’re going to love this,” he said. He reached into his jacket and pulled out an identical Sig Sauer P365. “We have the same gun.”



“Oh my. They’re even the same color.”



“Beautiful gun. The trigger–”



“Oh, don’t get me started–”



“Such a good feel.”



“Great feel. And so reliable. Perfect to conceal.”



“You have impeccable taste.”



Both guns remained pointed at the other, while the two stared deeply into each other's eyes.



“The last minute change is starting to make sense.”



“I was lying. My car works fine.”



“So this was your plan? Just get me sitting down, blow me away.”



“That’s about as far as I thought through.”



“Wait a second.” The man snapped with his empty hand. “I know you. Finding me on tinder, leading me to this house. What did the papers call you…The Siren!”



“A ghastly name.”



“Well it doesn’t do you justice!”



“That so?”



“I don’t think any name could do you justice. What would I have been? Number twelve?”



“The police know about eleven, but I’m about to hit thirty.”



“You’ve been busy. Very impressive.”



“Don’t get ahead of yourself. I think I know you too. You haven’t been in the papers lately, but you must be…are you SCK? Strangle-Chop-Kill?”



He reached into his jacket, pulled out a large hunting knife, and stabbed it, standing up, into the coffee table in front of him. “In the flesh.”



“I thought you’d be more muscly. From the descriptions of your victims.”



“Don’t let the bulky jacket fool you.” He jerked the knife out of the table and used the blade to raise his shirt revealing an eight pack that could cut diamonds.



“Oh.”



“Everything you dreamed of?”



“The descriptions were accurate.”



“Look, I think we both were in the mood tonight. And now we're thinking, well, where does this go? To be honest, I could never kill an artist like you.”



“I feel the same.”



“I have a proposal. I’ve been scoping out a homeless guy for two months. Isolated, easy target. What do you say we kill him together?”



“I’ve never done that with someone before.”



“I could be your first. Is it a date?”



“How do I know this isn’t just a trick to get the drop on me and kill me?”



“You don’t.”



He lowered his gun and put it back in his jacket. She holstered hers on her hip.



They both held hands and left to murder a vagrant.
