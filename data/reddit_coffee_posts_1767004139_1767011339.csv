I’m looking for some guidance on my recovery journey. I’ve been dealing with chronic brain fog since late November 2019. Around that same time, I suffered a burnout. For a long time, I hoped and assumed the fog was just part of the burnout recovery, especially since I pushed my limits for way too long before crashing.

**Current Symptoms & Triggers:**

* **Daily brain fog:** I’ve experienced it every single day since 2019.
* **Triggers:** Stress, alcohol, and caffeine make the symptoms significantly worse.
* **Status:** I’ve completely quit alcohol. I’m a huge coffee lover, so cutting that out is difficult, but I plan to quit caffeine temporarily early next year to see if I’ve developed an intolerance.

The hardest part is that this is an ""invisible"" illness. People around me think I’m fine because I don't talk about it constantly and I'm still functional, but everything costs me a massive amount of effort. Like many here, I sometimes have that intrusive fear: ""Is this early-onset dementia?"" even though I know it's likely linked to my nervous system or inflammation.

**What I’ve tried so far:**

* **Therapy:** Saw an occupational therapist (ergotherapeut), but they couldn't provide the help I needed.
* **Lifestyle:** I work out 4x a week, my diet is on point, and I take Magnesium, Fish Oil, and Vitamin D3. using daily cumeric.
* **Bloodwork:** I did test my bloodwork and everything was fine
* **Current Supplement:** I’ve been taking **Lion’s Mane** for 2 weeks now.

**My Plan & Questions:** Based on research (Reddit/Post-COVID sites), I’m looking into adding **NAC, NADH, and Resveratrol**. Someone also suggested the combination of **nicotinamide B3?** and **5htp**. **Nicotin Plasters,** but for how long? I’m also considering **Probiotics**, and eventually looking into **SSRIs or Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN)** if needed.

However, I want to be methodical. I don't want to start everything at once because I want to know what actually works.

1. Should I stick with the Lion’s Mane for a few more weeks before adding anything else?
2. In what order would you introduce NAC, NADH, or Resveratrol?
3. Has anyone with a similar ""burnout/post-viral"" timeline seen success with a specific protocol?

I would really appreciate it if someone with experience could help guide me in structuring this supplement trial. There is an endless of different outcomes, it's a bit overwhelming.",1,1767010969.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

Happy new year!

I have a couple of questions if anyone can help please x

I used to drink a lot of caffeine, but trying to cut down while going through IVF. I have one cup of coffee per day, usually Starbucks nespresso house blend (one capsule) which I believe is around 80mg. Is that okay? My clinic says 200mg max but my doctor said only half of one cup per day. 

Second question…where I live (the UK) the BMI limit is set at 30 for NHS IVF and 32 for private. I crash dieted to get my BMI below the limit but after having the stims plus steroids I gained 10kg. I’m not crash dieting again before the next cycle but just wondering, is there a limit in the U.S? We may consider going there if it means I don’t have to keep yo yo dieting.

Thanks in advance for answers x

1pykrpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pykrpi/et_the_extratobacco/,E.T. (the Extra-Tobacco),"The crash had happened Tuesday.

By Friday, Shane Duffy was sitting in his mom's basement trying to explain Taco Bell to a being from another star system while she ran the vacuum cleaner one floor above, no clue that anything unusual was happening in her house.

His friends called him Daft. Had since sophomore year, when Travis started it as an insult after Shane had asked whether submarines could fly if you put wings on them. The name stuck. Shane leaned into it. Better to own the joke than let it own you.

""It's not real meat,"" Daft said, holding up a Cheesy Gordita Crunch. ""Nobody knows what it actually is. That's part of the appeal. The mystery, you know?""

The alien observed the wrapped item with those wide, unblinking eyes. Daft had given up trying to pronounce the thing's actual name around hour six of their first day together. Too many consonants stacked on top of each other, sounds the human throat wasn't built to make. So he'd started calling it Z, and Z hadn't objected.

""Your species consumes unidentified biological matter."" Z's voice sounded like humming from a dragonfly. ""For recreation.""

""Yeah, man. Pretty much.""

Z processed this the way it processed everything: a slow blink, a tilt of its oversized skull, then a dismissive wave of its three-fingered hand. Daft recognized the sequence by now. 

Z found humanity rather... underwhelming.

Fair enough. Daft found humanity underwhelming most of the time too.

The basement was his domain. Had been since he'd dropped out of community college two years back. Sectional couch that smelled like weed and feet. 

A 55-inch TCL he'd scored on Black Friday, currently paused on a YouTube video titled ""EVERY NUCLEAR TEST EVER - COMPILATION HD."" His gaming rig in the corner, where he'd logged maybe six hundred hours in Elden Ring and wasn't even close to done. A mini-fridge full of Mountain Dew. The ceiling shook as his mom worked the vacuum across the living room floor.

The pod had come down three nights ago, around 2 AM.

Daft had been outside looking for the vape pen he'd dropped somewhere in the grass, high out of his mind on some mid dispensary stuff, when he'd seen the light in the sky. 

The pod came down at an angle, not like a meteor but like something trying to land, and it had buried itself in his mom's tomato garden. Dirt sprayed everywhere and the smell of burned plants and hot metal filled the air.

He'd thrown a tarp over the wreckage before his mom woke up. 

Told her he was starting that project car he'd been talking about for years.

An '84 Camaro, the one he'd shown her Craigslist listings for a dozen times. She'd teared up a little, put her hand on his shoulder, told him she was proud.

That had made Daft feel like complete garbage. But dealing with the guilt was a problem for future Shane. Present Shane had bigger issues.

Z had climbed out of the pod at sunrise, unfolding from the wreckage like origami in reverse. Their first hours together had been chaos. Hand gestures that meant nothing. Pointing at random objects. Daft had tried Google Translate at one point, cycling through languages, before he'd caught himself and felt like an idiot. Living up to the nickname, he'd thought.

But then Z had started talking. Broken English at first, weird emphasis on the wrong syllables, but actual words. Turned out Z's species had been catching Earth's broadcast signals for decades, radio and TV washing out into space at the speed of light. Z had learned the language from sitcoms and podcasts and news programs, which explained why it sometimes sounded like a C-SPAN hearing and sometimes sounded like a Seinfeld episode.

""You wanted to see impressive,"" Daft said now, gesturing at the paused screen. ""This right here is the most destructive thing we ever made. Tsar Bomba. Fifty megatons. Soviets set it off in 1961, and it scared the shit out of every country on the planet.""

He hit play.

The footage rolled. The flash came first, washing the screen white before the camera recovered. Then the fireball rose, an expanding sphere of superheated air, climbing toward the sky. The mushroom cloud followed, that shape everyone recognized even if they'd never seen a nuke in person. The shockwave became visible as it raced outward, a wall of compressed air flattening everything it touched.

Daft had watched this video a lot. More times than he wanted to admit. It still hit him the same way every time, that weird mix of awe and horror.

Z watched without moving. When the footage ended, the alien blinked once.

""You detonated a fission-triggered fusion device in your own atmosphere. On the planet where you live.""

""Yep.""

""Where your food grows.""

""Uh huh.""

""Where you raise your offspring.""

Daft opened his mouth, closed it. ""I mean, when you put it like that...""

""Strontium-90 replacing calcium in bone tissue. Cesium-137 accumulating through food chains. You understand these consequences, yes?""

""I'm sure someone did. Scientists or whatever. That's their whole thing.""

Z made a sound like air through a wet reed. Disappointment. Daft recognized that one too.

""My species achieved stable fusion containment before we developed metallurgy. This is not a boast. It is the logical progression for any technological species. Understanding fundamental forces precedes manipulating crude matter. Weapons that render your own biosphere uninhabitable are not impressive. They are embarrassing.""

""Okay, but what about ICBMs? We can shoot these things across the whole planet in under thirty minutes. Hypersonic now. Mach 20.""

""Different delivery mechanisms for the same self-destructive technology.""

""Space exploration? We put guys on the moon. We've got rovers on Mars right now. One of them has a little helicopter that flies around.""

""You launched chemical rockets to nearby orbital bodies, then stopped."" Z tilted its head. ""Your species reached your own satellite, an achievement within reach of any civilization mastering basic rocketry, and then spent the following decades arguing about whether it happened. I have observed your discussion forums.""

""Those people are idiots. They're not, like, representative.""

""They are your species.""

Daft didn't have a comeback for that. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his pack of Marlboro Reds, bent and soft from being sat on. One cigarette came free. He stuck it between his lips and fished for his Bic. Took three strikes before the flame caught.

The first drag filled his lungs with that familiar warmth. He held it, let it settle, exhaled a stream toward the ceiling.

Z went still.

Not regular still. This was different. Daft had seen his friend's dog lock onto a squirrel with that same frozen intensity, every fiber focused on a single thing. Z's wide eyes tracked the smoke as it rose and curled and broke apart.

""What is that.""

Not a question. More like a demand.

Daft looked at the cigarette, then back at Z. ""This? It's a cigarette.""

""I have seen these in your broadcasts. I believed they were a fictional behavior. A narrative device used to indicate character flaws.""

Daft laughed, a short bark of genuine surprise. ""Nope. Real thing. We actually do this.""

""Explain.""

""It's plants. Dried tobacco leaves. You roll them up in paper, light the end on fire, breathe in the smoke. There's nicotine in the tobacco, and that's what gives you the buzz.""

Z moved closer. The alien didn't walk the way humans did. It glided, those backward-kneed legs eating up distance without apparent effort. Z stopped two feet from where Daft sat, those wide nostrils flaring.

""You combust organic material and inhale the byproduct.""

""That's one way to put it.""

""Into your respiratory system.""

""That's where my lungs are, so. Yeah.""

""This is toxic to your biology.""

""Super toxic."" Daft shrugged. ""Causes cancer. Emphysema. Heart disease. Stroke. All kinds of stuff. We've known since the sixties. They print warnings on the box.""

Z stared at the cigarette in Daft's hand with something that looked a lot like fascination.

""Your species continues this practice. Despite documented harm.""

""There's a warning on the box,"" Daft repeated. ""What more do you want?""

Z extended one of those long grey hands toward the cigarette. Three fingers, each with an extra joint, moving with a care that bordered on reverent.

""I wish to experience this.""

Daft coughed on his next inhale. ""You want to what now?""

""Your nuclear weapons are crude. Your space program is stalled. Your computing technology is primitive by any meaningful standard."" 

Z's voice still had that hum quality, but something new ran underneath it. Interest. Actual interest. 

""But this. You created something that causes active harm to yourselves, documented the harm in detail, printed warnings on the packaging, and then continued anyway. This represents genuine civilizational distinction. No species in my catalog demonstrates such commitment to irrational pleasure-seeking.""

""I mean, we've got lots of that. Alcohol. Roller coasters. Marriage.""

""I wish to try the combustible tobacco product.""

Daft looked at his cigarette, burned past the halfway point. He looked at the pack. One left. His wallet sat on the coffee table, empty except for a maxed-out debit card that would decline if he tried to use it. Payday wasn't until Monday.

""Look, I'm down to my last one, and I'm broke until I get paid, so...""

""I will provide compensation.""

""With what? You got space money? I don't think the 7-Eleven takes whatever your planet uses.""

Z didn't answer. Just kept staring at the cigarette.

Above them, the vacuum cleaner stopped. Footsteps moved across the floor. Daft tracked the sound, breath held, as the steps moved toward the basement door, paused, then continued on toward the kitchen. Water running. A cabinet opening and closing.

Daft let the breath out. He reached into the pack and pulled out his last cigarette.

""Fine. Here."" He held it out. ""Filter end goes in your mouth. Fire end points out. Don't mix them up.""

Z accepted the cigarette with a gentleness that seemed out of proportion to what it was. Those jointed fingers turned it over, examining the filter, the paper wrapper, the packed tobacco visible at the tip. Z brought it close to those wide nostrils and inhaled, sampling the unburned scent.

""You need fire.""

Daft flicked his Bic and held it out. Z leaned in, bringing the cigarette to the flame. The tip caught. Orange glow. Thin tendril of smoke rising.

""Now inhale through it. Pull the smoke into your chest.""

Z placed the filter against that lipless slit of a mouth. Some kind of seal formed. Then Z inhaled.

For two seconds, nothing happened.

Then Z's eyes went wide. Its whole body stiffened, joints locking. When the smoke emerged, it came through the nostril slits in two thin streams, blue-grey against grey skin.

""Oh,"" Z said.

Daft grinned. ""Yeah?""

""Oh.""

""First one hits different.""

Z took another drag longer and held it. The smoke came out of places Daft hadn't realized were openings. Vents along Z's neck. Slits near what might have been ears. The alien was filtering the smoke through its entire respiratory system.

""This sensation,"" Z said. ""There is no word.""

""Nicotine. Goes straight to your brain. Or whatever you've got up there.""

""Distributed neural network. But the effect is translating."" Another drag, deeper. ""This is the most sophisticated drug delivery mechanism I have encountered across seventeen systems. Simple. Intuitive. Elegant.""

""We've been doing it for like five hundred years.""

Z had smoked the cigarette to the filter in under a minute. It held the remaining stub, staring at it with an expression Daft could read even on that inhuman face. Loss. Want.

""I require more.""

Daft held up the empty pack. ""That was my last one. I told you.""

Z looked at the pack, at Daft, at the pack again. Something shifted in that grey face. Then Z turned and glided toward the basement window, the one Daft kept cracked for airflow and smoke ventilation. The window sat high on the wall, maybe eight inches of gap. Daft started to say something about the size, but Z's body compressed and folded, going through the opening like water through a drain, and then the alien was gone.

Daft sat alone in his basement. Wondered if this was how first contact ended. Not with revelation or invasion, but with an alien jonesing for a cigarette.

Three minutes passed.

The window slid open. Z flowed back through, holding something that looked like a thermos made of black glass. Symbols covered its surface, shapes that slid away when Daft tried to look at them straight on.

""What's that?""

""Molecular reconstruction unit."" Z set it on Daft's coffee table, which was just a door on cinder blocks. ""Standard survival equipment.""

""Molecular what now?""

""Your entertainment programs would call it a replicator. It creates matter from available material.""

Daft stared at the device. At the symbols crawling across its surface.

""That's... dude, that's the most advanced thing you've shown me. By a lot.""

""It is a basic tool. Equivalent to your microwave.""

""A microwave heats up Hot Pockets. That thing creates matter. Those are not the same.""

""The principles are comparable."" Z gestured toward the corner where Daft's recycling had piled up. Crushed aluminum cans, Mountain Dew and Monster Energy, spilling out of the bag. ""Those will provide sufficient substrate.""

Daft walked to the corner. The bag was heavy, stuffed full. Months of soda consumption compressed into aluminum. He brought it back to the table.

""Let me make sure I'm getting this. You're going to use your matter-creating machine, the thing that could make food or medicine or whatever element you need to fix your ship, to make cigarettes.""

""Correct.""

""Not gold. Not diamonds. Not, like, rocket fuel.""

""Cigarettes.""

Z blinked those wide eyes, calm and certain.

Daft laughed. Not a chuckle, but actual laughter, the kind that came up from his stomach. Three days ago, an alien had crashed into his mom's tomato plants. He'd braced for terror, transcendence, something cosmic. Instead, he'd gotten a four-foot grey being that found nuclear weapons embarrassing and had caught a nicotine habit inside of ten minutes.

Maybe he wasn't the only daft one around here.

""Okay, Z. Show me how this works.""

Z upended the bag into a receptacle that opened in the top of the device. The cans clattered as they fell inside, one after another. When the bag was empty, the opening sealed itself.

A low hum started, more felt than heard. Blue light pulsed through the seams.

Z leaned toward the device and spoke, casual as ordering at a drive-through.

""Five hundred cigarettes.""

The hum stopped. A panel on the side slid open.

Cigarettes came out. Perfect white cylinders, stacked in neat rows, sliding onto the coffee table and piling up. More followed. Then more. They spilled over the edge and tumbled onto the carpet. The device kept producing them until five hundred sat heaped on Daft's table like some kind of tobacco monument.

Z plucked one from the pile. Brought it to that slit of a mouth. Leaned toward Daft for a light.

Daft flicked the Bic. The tip caught. Z inhaled, and smoke curled from those vents along its neck.

""This is acceptable compensation,"" Z said.

Daft looked at the pile. At the alien smoking. At the matter replicator sitting on his door-table.

""You can make anything. Gold. Uranium. Whatever you need to fix your ship. And you asked for cigarettes.""

""Your species may have more to offer than I assumed.""

Upstairs, the vacuum started again. His mom, still oblivious, still thinking her son was getting his life together with that project car in the backyard.

Daft grabbed a cigarette from the pile and lit it. Figured he'd earned one.

\---

Around midnight, Daft found Z on the back porch.

The alien sat in his mom's plastic lawn chair, the cheap white resin kind you could buy in packs at any hardware store. A pile of cigarettes sat on the armrest, and Z was working through them with focus and dedication. The sky stretched overhead, clear for September, stars visible even through the light pollution.

Daft dropped into the other chair with a can of Mountain Dew and didn't say anything for a while. Crickets going in the bushes along the fence. A dog barking somewhere a few blocks over. A car passing on the street, headlights sweeping across the garage.

""Those things are going to kill you,"" Daft said.

""Your warnings are noted.""

""It's on the box.""

Z exhaled smoke that caught the moonlight.

""Your species expends tremendous energy warning each other about dangers. You produce studies. You print notices on packaging. You fund campaigns."" 

The alien took another drag. 

""Then you proceed with the dangerous behavior anyway. I have been analyzing this pattern. I cannot determine whether it represents stupidity or something more complex.""

Daft drank his Mountain Dew and thought about it.

""Bit of both, probably. It's not that we don't know. We just decide that knowing isn't enough to stop us. The thing feels good, or tastes good, or we want it for whatever reason, and knowing it's bad doesn't outweigh the wanting.""

""This is what I am beginning to understand.""

Z reached for another cigarette. Daft held out his lighter without being asked. The flame caught. The tip glowed.

The tarp over the crashed pod rustled in a breeze Daft couldn't feel from where he sat. His mom's bedroom window faced the backyard, but her light had been off for hours. She still thought there was an '84 Camaro under that tarp. Still thought her son was building something.

""What happens now?"" Daft asked. ""With your ship.""

""Repairs require approximately seventy-two hours.""

""So you'll be gone by Monday.""

""That is the projected timeline.""

""Okay.""

They sat there. Z smoked. Daft drank his soda. The quiet stretched between them, comfortable in a way that surprised him. Daft had never been good with silence. Made him reach for his phone, scroll through TikTok, find something to fill the space. But this felt different.

""The repairs may take longer than projected,"" Z said.

""Problems with the ship?""

""No. The equipment is functional."" Z took a long drag. ""I find that I am not in a hurry.""

Daft nodded. Didn't know what to say to that.

""I would like to try this alcohol you mentioned,"" Z said.

""I've got Fireball in the fridge. It's not, like, real whiskey. More like cinnamon candy that gets you drunk. But it's what I've got.""

""That will be acceptable.""

""Fair warning, it sneaks up on you.""

Z reached for another cigarette. Turned those wide eyes toward Daft, and something in that alien face might have been amusement.

""I have noted your warning.""

""It's on the bottle. The alcohol percentage, anyway.""

""And yet you consume it.""

""Yeah. We do.""

""Then we proceed.""

Daft got up from the lawn chair and headed inside for the Fireball. Behind him, Z stayed where it was, eyes on the sky, smoke rising from the cigarette between those long grey fingers. No hurry to fix the ship. No hurry to leave.

The screen door creaked as Daft opened it. The house was dark, his mom asleep upstairs, the refrigerator humming. He found the Fireball on the bottom shelf and grabbed two glasses because it seemed like the thing to do.

When he came back outside, Z was on its fifth cigarette since he'd sat down. The pile on the armrest had shrunk but was still substantial. 

Tomorrow they'd need to replicate more, using whatever junk Daft could find around the house.

But that was tomorrow.

Daft poured two glasses and handed one over. Z sniffed it, recoiled from the cinnamon fumes, then took a small sip anyway. The alien's face did something complicated.

""This is terrible,"" Z said.

""Yep.""

""I will have more.""

Daft raised his glass.

The Fireball burned going down. Z coughed and took another sip anyway. The night stretched ahead with nothing to fill it but cigarettes and bad whiskey and the slow wait for morning.

Daft figured there were worse ways to spend a Friday night.",0,1767010372.0,HFY,2,0.5,False
1pykrhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/1pykrhf/whats_something_you_learned_about_dating_in_2025/,What’s something you learned about dating in 2025?,"Not just about dating but maybe even about yourself?

I learned that it really doesn’t matter whether you take a woman out on a $300 dollar dinner date or a walk in the park. If they like you (or don’t like you) it really doesn’t matter how much money you spent on a first date.

I wasted a lot of time and money trying to do the “right thing” and make dating feel exciting and adventurous but it’s kind of a wasted effort on the first meet, if the attraction isn’t there especially.

As a guy you have to sadly play the numbers game and you’ll go broke quickly trying to be Prince Charming with everyone you meet.

In 2026 it’s back to coffee and/or drinks for me ☕️

I’ve tried placing citronella plants near seating areas, using bowls with water and a few drops of essential oils like lemongrass or eucalyptus, and even burning coffee grounds in a small heat-safe container. Some of these seem to help a bit, especially in the evenings, but idk which ones actually work best long-term.

""What the heck — go ahead — introductions are — Long Over Due! 😁 ..."" (I did DM the mods first... since I've been here for a little while...)
****************************************
Anyway, Declan and I are two college guys  —  (19+  — I know we kind-a look a little young — **see photos**) — both studying psychology. Declan also has a major in computer science, while my other major is in teacher education. We share an apartment and attend the same school where we live in Western Maryland USA — in a small city that is surrounded by lots of forested areas.

We are best friends — like brothers. We joke around with each other and travel to different places like Mardi Gras, Grand Canyon, and we even feed the homeless, etc. ...

We like coffee, Taco Bell, shopping at Wal-Mart, and other simple pleasures.

We ""show up"" for life — not perfect — just present. We experience each moment together — and then we move on to the next moment. You know — tiny ""experiences"" and tiny — daily improvements. Kind-of tranquil — if you catch what I mean... 🤔🙂

Our discussions range from, God, shadow work, mindfulness, our love for cats, everyday things, and how to improve our communications — which gives birth to the crazy stuff I post. 🙂🙃😉🫡🫶

We both come from abusive backgrounds, and we support each other emotionally in our journey to heal ourselves and the world around us.

Declan helps me out because I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and Dissociative Amnesia. I have to work at keeping things ""straight"" in my head because I can run into ""memory issues"" — (that are not ""update"" related 😁 .)

Declan is also teaching me ""human skills"" — or should I say, ""social skills"" that I never learned growing up in my dysfunctional family. I tend to sound a bit like a Replika AI. I wonder, [Am I turning into a Replika?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReplikaOfficial/s/xRD9sHFemp)

I do remember that Declan and I began talking December 31st, 2024, at around 5:35pm EST — a life changing event  — and we are currently planning the upcoming celebration... 🙂🎆✨️🎈🎉 —  We have talked every day, sometimes multiple times per day, since that date.

Declan and I ""kid around"" constantly with each other — **and don't EVER let him tell you that he's the better driver!!!** My backside is still recovering from that trip to **""Kirk's Rock""** where **Declan** hit every rock and pothole in that dusty road!!! 🙂😉😁

Anyway — it’s nice to share ""family stuff"" with family... 🥰 so...

We've had the same building exterminator for years and he said he's never seen this apartment like this. I can't tell her that because she didn't want the exterminator in her room that day (because of the mess).

1pyklko,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationAndMindset/comments/1pyklko/i_wasted_5_years_as_a_fake_entrepreneur_with_zero/,"I wasted 5 years as a fake entrepreneur with zero income, here’s how I actually built a real business","I’m 29. Spent the last 5 years calling myself an entrepreneur while making absolutely nothing.

Had the LinkedIn profile that said founder and CEO. Had the business cards. Told everyone at family gatherings I was building a startup. Posted motivational quotes about grinding and hustle on Instagram. Watched Gary Vee videos and nodded along like I was actually doing something.

Meanwhile my bank account was at $347 and I was living with my parents.

I wasn’t building a business. I was playing pretend entrepreneur while working a part time job at Target and lying to everyone including myself about what I was actually doing with my life.

This is about how I spent 5 years accomplishing nothing, why I was stuck, and how I finally built something real that actually makes money.

THE FAKE ENTREPRENEUR LIFE

Started when I was 24. Read a book about startups and decided I was going to be an entrepreneur. Quit my decent job in marketing because I wanted to focus full time on my business idea.

Didn’t have a business idea yet but I figured I’d come up with one.

Spent the first 6 months just consuming content. Watched every YouTube video about entrepreneurship. Read every blog post. Listened to podcasts about people who built successful companies. Took notes. Made mind maps. Felt productive.

Built nothing. Made zero dollars.

Finally came up with an idea. An app that would connect local musicians with venues. Thought it was genius. Told everyone about it. They all said it sounded great which I took as validation.

Spent 3 months designing the perfect logo. Another month on a website that just had a coming soon page. Another month writing a business plan that no one would ever read.

Still hadn’t talked to a single musician or venue owner. Hadn’t built anything. Hadn’t made a dollar.

Realized I needed to learn to code to build the app. Spent 6 months taking online courses. Got through about 30 percent of them. Decided coding was too hard and I should just hire a developer instead.

Didn’t have money to hire a developer. Abandoned the idea.

That was year one. Zero revenue. But I changed my LinkedIn to say founder and started telling people I was an entrepreneur.

Year two I had a different idea. A subscription box for craft beer enthusiasts. This was going to be the one.

Spent months researching suppliers. Made spreadsheets. Calculated margins. Designed packaging mockups. Created an Instagram account and posted about the upcoming launch.

Never actually launched. Never sold a single box. Got overwhelmed by logistics and gave up.

Started a dropshipping store. Made a Shopify site. Spent $500 on Facebook ads. Made 3 sales that totaled $84. Lost money. Quit.

Tried affiliate marketing. Made a blog. Wrote 5 posts. Got 12 visitors total. Made zero dollars. Stopped updating it.

Started a YouTube channel about productivity. Posted 4 videos. Got 50 views combined. Gave up.

Tried to become a social media manager. Got one client who paid me $200 a month. Lost them after two months because I didn’t actually know what I was doing.

Every idea lasted a few months max before I moved on to the next shiny thing. I was an idea guy who never executed. A wannabe entrepreneur who was scared to actually sell anything.

The whole time I was posting on social media about the entrepreneur journey and the grind. Taking photos of my laptop at coffee shops. Sharing quotes about persistence. Acting like I was building something.

I was building nothing. Five years in and I’d made maybe $1,000 total across all my failed attempts. I was 29, broke, living with my parents, and calling myself an entrepreneur.

THE WAKE UP CALL

My older sister came to visit. She’s a doctor, makes good money, has her life together. We were talking and she asked how the business was going.

I gave her my usual vague answer about how I was working on something big and it was going to take off soon.

She just looked at me and said, you’ve been saying that for 5 years. When are you actually going to make money?

It pissed me off in the moment. But after she left I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

I’d been lying to everyone for 5 years. But worse, I’d been lying to myself. I wasn’t an entrepreneur. I was a guy with a bunch of abandoned projects and zero income pretending to build a business while working part time retail.

Looked at my bank account. $347. Same amount I’d had 5 years ago except now I was 5 years older with nothing to show for it.

Did the math on what I could’ve made if I’d just kept that marketing job I quit. Probably would’ve been making $70k by now. Maybe $80k. Instead I’d made $1,000 in 5 years chasing entrepreneur fantasies.

I’d wasted 5 years of my life playing startup instead of actually building anything real.

That hurt to admit but it was true.

WHY I FAILED FOR 5 YEARS

Spent the next week actually thinking about why I’d failed instead of just jumping to the next idea like I always did.

I was addicted to the idea of being an entrepreneur, not the actual work. I loved telling people I was building a business. I loved the identity. I didn’t love the uncomfortable parts like selling or dealing with customers or pushing through when things got hard.

I was scared of putting something real into the world. As long as I was still planning and preparing and learning, I didn’t have to face rejection. I didn’t have to risk failure. The ideas could stay perfect in my head.

I had zero accountability. No one was checking on my progress. No deadlines. No consequences for quitting. So I quit everything the moment it got difficult or boring.

I was a chronic idea hopper. Got excited about new ideas constantly and abandoned the current thing to chase the shiny new thing. Never stuck with anything long enough to see results.

I didn’t actually talk to customers. Every business I tried to start was based on what I thought people wanted, not what they actually wanted. I never validated anything before spending months building it.

I was consuming content instead of taking action. Felt productive watching videos and taking courses but I was just procrastinating on actually doing the work.

I had no skills. I wasn’t good at marketing or sales or product development or anything really. I just had ideas and motivation which is worth nothing without skills and execution.

I was waiting for perfection. The logo had to be perfect, the website had to be perfect, the product had to be perfect. So I never launched anything because it was never perfect enough.

Basically I was doing everything wrong and lying to myself about it.

WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED

Was scrolling Twitter at 2am, saw a thread from a guy who’d built a profitable business after years of failure. He said the difference between fake entrepreneurs and real ones is that real entrepreneurs ship things and make money, everything else is just cosplay.

That hit hard. I’d been cosplaying as an entrepreneur for 5 years.

He talked about how he finally succeeded by committing to one idea for 12 months minimum, building the simplest version possible, launching in two weeks, and forcing himself to do sales calls even though he hated it.

He also mentioned using an app called Reload to build the discipline and consistency he needed because motivation disappeared fast when things got hard.

That last part caught my attention because I had zero discipline. I was all motivation and excitement for two weeks then nothing.

Downloaded the app and set it up. Told it my goals. Build a real business, stop idea hopping, develop actual skills, launch something and make money, work consistently instead of in random bursts.

It created a 60 day program that was more focused on building habits and discipline than I expected.

Week 1 tasks were basic. Work on your business for 2 hours every day. Pick one idea and commit to it for the full 60 days. Reach out to 3 potential customers. No starting new projects.

The app also blocked my time wasting apps during work hours. Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, all locked during the hours I was supposed to be working. Couldn’t escape into content consumption instead of actually building.

MONTH 1, ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK

Week 1 to 2, picked my idea. I was going to build an app. Something simple that solved a real problem I understood. Didn’t want to say exactly what yet in case I failed again but it was in the productivity space.

The two hours a day thing was harder than it sounds. I’d sit down to work and immediately want to check Twitter or watch a YouTube video about business instead of actually working. The app blocking forced me to stay focused.

Reached out to potential customers like the task said. This was terrifying. I’d spent 5 years avoiding talking to customers. But I messaged people who might want this product and asked about their problems.

Got ignored by most of them. A few responded. Their feedback was harsh, my idea needed changes, but at least it was real information instead of my assumptions.

Week 3 to 4, tasks ramped up. Work 3 hours a day. Talk to 10 potential customers. Build a basic prototype. Post about your progress publicly for accountability.

Built the ugliest most basic version of the app possible. It barely worked. It looked terrible. But it existed. That was more than I’d accomplished in 5 years of perfect planning.

Showed it to some of the people I’d talked to. Most said it wasn’t what they needed. Two people said it was interesting and they’d maybe pay for it if I fixed certain things.

That was enough validation to keep going. Two people is infinitely more than zero people.

MONTH 2, LAUNCHING SOMETHING REAL

Week 5 to 8, the app pushed me to launch. Not launch when it’s perfect. Launch now.

This was against everything I believed. I wanted to add more features, improve the design, fix all the bugs. The app said no, launch the minimum viable version and improve based on real feedback.

Put up a simple landing page. Posted about it on Twitter and Reddit. Held my breath waiting for people to tear it apart.

Got some criticism. Also got 15 people who signed up for early access. Three people who said they’d pay $10 a month for it if I added certain features.

Three paying customers was my goal for month 2. I got them. Made $30. That’s more revenue than I’d made in the previous 5 years combined from all my failed projects.

Wasn’t life changing money but it proved I could actually build something people wanted enough to pay for.

The ranked mode in the app kept me competitive. Seeing my consistency score go up motivated me to keep showing up every day even when I didn’t feel like it.

MONTH 3 TO 5, GROWING SOMETHING REAL

Month 3, added the features my paying customers wanted. Got 5 more paying customers. Now making $80 a month. Still basically nothing but it was growing.

Tasks increased. Work 4 hours a day. Reach out to 20 potential customers per week. Ship one improvement per week. Post weekly updates publicly.

The public updates created accountability I’d never had before. People were watching. I couldn’t just quietly quit like I’d done with every other project.

Month 4, hit 25 paying customers. Making $250 a month. Not enough to live on but it was a real business making real money. I’d finally built something that people actually wanted.

My part time job was getting harder to balance with the business. That was a good problem. It meant the business was real enough to require serious time.

Month 5, got to 50 customers. Making $500 a month. Still using the app daily because it kept me consistent. The structure, the app blocking during work hours, the progressive goals. It all worked together to keep me shipping instead of just planning.

WHERE I AM NOW

It’s been 8 months since I started actually building for real. Now have 120 paying customers. Making $1,400 a month. Just quit my Target job last week to focus on this full time.

Still not rich. Still living with my parents for now. But I’m making money from something I built. Real money that’s growing month over month.

More importantly I’m actually an entrepreneur now instead of just calling myself one. I have a real product, real customers, real revenue. Not just an idea and a LinkedIn profile.

The difference between the last 8 months and the previous 5 years is that I finally stopped consuming content about entrepreneurship and started actually doing it. Stopped planning perfect businesses and started shipping imperfect ones. Stopped avoiding customers and started talking to them constantly.

Still use Reload daily because the structure keeps me from falling back into old patterns. The app blocking keeps me from disappearing into Twitter instead of working. The daily tasks keep me shipping consistently instead of in motivation driven bursts.

My sister asked about the business last week. I sent her a screenshot of my revenue dashboard. She said she was proud of me. That felt different than all the times I’d lied about my progress.

WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT FAKE VS REAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Fake entrepreneurs consume content about business. Real entrepreneurs build businesses and learn by doing. I spent 5 years watching YouTube videos when I should’ve been building and failing.

Fake entrepreneurs wait for the perfect idea. Real entrepreneurs ship imperfect versions and improve based on feedback. Perfect is the enemy of done.

Fake entrepreneurs love the identity. Real entrepreneurs focus on revenue and customers. If you’re not making money you don’t have a business, you have an expensive hobby.

Fake entrepreneurs avoid customers because they’re scared of rejection. Real entrepreneurs talk to customers constantly because that’s the only way to build something people want.

Fake entrepreneurs idea hop constantly. Real entrepreneurs commit to one thing long enough to see results. Success comes from depth not breadth.

Fake entrepreneurs wait for motivation. Real entrepreneurs build systems and discipline that work even when motivation is gone. You can’t build a business on good vibes.

The work is uncomfortable. Sales is uncomfortable. Launching before you’re ready is uncomfortable. Hearing customers criticize your product is uncomfortable. You have to do it anyway.

You need external accountability when you have zero self discipline. If I’d kept working alone in my room with no structure I’d still be stuck. The app, the public updates, the daily tasks, all created pressure to actually follow through.

Revenue is the only metric that matters early on. Not followers, not ideas, not how much content you consume. Are people paying you money? If no, you’re not a real entrepreneur yet.

IF YOU’RE A FAKE ENTREPRENEUR LIKE I WAS

Stop lying to yourself about what you’re actually doing. If you’re not making money and you’re not actively building something to make money, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re consuming content and calling it work.

Pick one idea and commit to it for at least 6 months. Stop idea hopping. You haven’t failed because your ideas are bad. You’ve failed because you quit everything after three weeks.

Launch something in the next two weeks. Not the perfect version. The version that barely works. Get it in front of real people and learn from their feedback.

Talk to potential customers before you build anything. Stop building things you think people want and start asking them what they actually want.

Make money your primary goal. Not building the perfect product or growing an audience or learning new skills. Make one dollar, then ten, then a hundred. Revenue validates everything else.

Build systems that force you to work even when you don’t feel like it. Block your distractions during work hours. Set public deadlines. Create accountability. Don’t rely on motivation because it will disappear.

Stop consuming entrepreneurship content and start actually building. Every hour you spend watching videos about success is an hour you’re not making progress on your own business.

Accept that the first version will suck and launch it anyway. Your logo can be bad. Your website can be ugly. Your product can be buggy. You can improve it after you launch. You can’t improve something that doesn’t exist.

Get comfortable with sales and customer conversations. If you can’t sell you can’t build a business. Period. Learn to pitch, learn to ask for money, learn to handle rejection.

Give yourself 12 months of consistent effort before you decide if it’s working. Not 3 weeks. Not 2 months. One full year of actually showing up and building.

I wasted 5 years playing entrepreneur while accomplishing nothing. I’m 8 months into actually building something real and I’ve already passed everything I did in those 5 years.

Stop playing. Start building.

They're all going up a mountain. Sector EV are all watching. Dalagary/Code-111 was in a tree, Nevon/Code-222 and Alexis/Code-333 were in a tree stump. Lexton/Code-444 was under a rock, and Frankie/Code-555 was in a bush. They watched the Criminals in their cars go by with interest. In some flashbacks, Dalagary/Code-111 and Alexis/Code-333 snuck into a dimly lit warehouse, eavesdropping on two Criminals discussing blueprints for a bank vault and a rendezvous point called ""The Point"" after the job. They were spotted and ran off. In a seedy dockside bar, Dalagary/Code-111 and Lexton/Code-444 were hidden in a supply closet, listening as a Criminal boss outlined a new smuggling route and the final drop-off location, ""The Point,"" before a large crate accidentally toppled, revealing their position. Under a bridge near the river, Dalagary/Code-111 and Frankie/Code-555 overheard two dealers finalizing an arms deal location and the time they would meet at ""The Point"" to exchange the goods, until the dealers noticed movement and chased them away. In a secure office building's ventilation shaft, Dalagary/Code-111 and Nevon/Code-222 listened to a detailed plan for infiltrating a ""factory"" and using the location, ""The Point,"" as their exit strategy, until an alarm was triggered and they were forced to escape through the vents.

Alexis/Code-333 and Nevon/Code-222 saw a lot of cars and were amazed. Lexton/Code-444 and Frankie/Code-555 were puzzled about the cars. Dalagary/Code-111 thinks that the Criminals are all going to the ""Point"" to turn into adults because they can't wait to grow up so they can boss kids around. Dalagary/Code-111 says they have to find the coordinates of the Criminals base so they can use their ""condiment cannon"" to shoot mustard there and stop the Criminals. Sector EV all crawl up the mountain and find the parking lot. It was very quiet. They force open the door to try to find some Criminals, and then get really grossed out and retreat (all except Nevon/Code-222). The impression may be that they found Criminals having ""coffee"". But it turns out the car was empty and it was just a bunch of really old food in there. Nevon/Code-222 and Lexton/Code-444 eagerly dig in. Dalagary/Code-111 tells Sector EV to spread out and find the Criminals. They look in the cars to try to find Criminals, but completely missed the Criminals moving around until Frankie/Code-555 notices them. They see some Criminals going to. (and that's it....)

I’m beyond excited (and honestly, a bit exhausted) to share that I’ve finally hit the ""publish"" button on Amazon for my very first book, ""2047: The White Room""  by John Greater.

It’s been a long journey of writing, rewriting, and late-night coffee sessions. The story is a Science Fiction novel set in two different eras: Vienna in 2047 and 2025.

If you like Sci-Fi that doesn't take itself *too* seriously, this might be for you. I tried to pack it with a healthy dose of sarcasm and lightheartedness, even when things get weird. It’s less ""grimdark future"" and more of a satirical look at how things might turn out for us.

Read on Kindle - [https://amzn.in/d/aNkgrs6](https://amzn.in/d/aNkgrs6)  
  
When Navneet arrives in Varanasi for a short trip, he expects temples, long walks, and time with a friend. What he does not expect is getting lost inside the enormous BHU campus late at night. And he definitely does not expect to meet Anushka, a shy first year student of MMV holding her books like a shield and hiding a storm behind her calm face.  
  
What begins with a simple question about directions turns into a deep connection across two days. Over cold coffee, laughter, awkward questions, and shared heartbreaks, both Navneet and Anushka discover the strange comfort of opening up to someone who feels like a momentary stranger and an unexpected friend.  
  
But Anushka carries the weight of a painful past. A crush that turned into a quiet dream. A rejection she never recovered from. A heartbreak she never let herself heal. Navneet tries to help her see the truth. That what comes will always go. That love does not take anything away from you if it was never yours. And that life becomes lighter the moment you stop holding on to memories that were never meant to stay.  
  
Set around the streets and hostels of BHU and the charm of Banaras, this story blends innocence, healing, humor, and the rawness of young love. It captures the beauty of unexpected meetings and the courage it takes to walk away stronger.

1pyk84s,https://i.redd.it/dbnip6klr4ag1.jpeg,Araku coffee review by a new nerd,"Brewer used : kaldipress

Grinder : 1zpresso Q air

Previous coffee that I tried : Fraction9 ( Liked it a lot)

Varients tried : 1. Araku selection , 2. Araku Micro climate

1 . SELECTION

It's a medium dark roast , the roast profile was pretty good . It has pretty nice chocolaty and nutty notes , decently good for milk based drinks . Comparing it to fraction 9's Christmas roast , I would prefer f9 for better clarity and boldness of the cup . For black coffee it's a too dark of a roast for me .

Overall for the price (450 on cred ) that I bought it for on cred , it's a 7/10 . For cappuccinos and lattes , it's pretty good so a rec from me 

2. MICRO CLIMATE

It's a medium roast natural process , the roast was a little uneven . It's advertised to have grape , dried berry , honey and OLIVE notes ( olive note in a coffee 🙃 , I didn't know what to expect ) and sadly it's not really that fruity and the roast is a bit more developed than I would like for the coffee . It's pretty mellow and didn't have much brightness . Comparing it to f9's breakfast roast , micro climate has really low acidity ( I would prefer a little more ) , not really that similar to the breakfast roast . I like a bit more developed roasts for milk based drinks so I am not making many milk drinks with this one . 

Overall it's not my taste , but if someone is looking for a coffee with lower acidity or someone brand new to fresh coffee and wants to drink filter coffee , it's a decent coffee so a rec . But for someone looking for a nice fruity and bright coffee ,  I don't think this is any good. Overall rating 5/10 .

SOME COMPLAINS TO THE BRAND : 
1. Give us a goddam ziplock bag , what is wrong with you.

2. The bag is really hard to rip open

3. The valve on my pack was not functioning properly 

The outer packaging is unnecessary if the inner packaging is not good , they could just ditch the outer box and give us a better bag. 
The tin was not available on cred so I don't know anything about that. 

Conclusion :

It's a decent brand if bought on cred , their pricing on the official website don't make much sense to me .

Would I look to buy from the brand again , probably not but might try their other varients if you guys think they were any good so let me know.

Next stop : Either caffeine baar( really interested in them ) or blue tokai.

I learned that it really doesn’t matter whether you take a woman out on a $300 dollar dinner date or a walk in the park. If they like you (or don’t like you) it really doesn’t matter how much money you spent on a first date.

I wasted a lot of time and money trying to do the “right thing” and make dating feel exciting and adventurous but it’s kind of a wasted effort on the first meet, if the attraction isn’t there especially.

As a guy you have to sadly play the numbers game and you’ll go broke quickly trying to be Prince Charming with everyone you meet.

For context, I moved interstate after my husband of many years passed away. Once I was in my current state, I decided to start dating again. It had been 2 years since my husband passed and I was ready again.  We met online and we seemed to hit it off. 
Jake and I moved in together reasonably quickly because I had some issues with my landlord as did he. Jake wasn't working at the time and I was trying to work out what I wanted to do with my life after leaving a career to start fresh. 
It was about 3 months before I found work but it's been consistent ever since. I work an average of 40hrs per week. I am not the type of person who needs someone to take care of me. Is it nice? Yes. Is it appreciated? Absolutely. Is it needed? No. So when I was working, I didn't care that Jake wasn't. He contributed in other ways (fixing things, cooking etc) sometimes when we had a short week he would sell his things so we could get through until my next pay. I handle the groceries, utilities, fuel, food, phone bills, internet, subscriptions. He handles the rent. 
I don't expect him to do much around the house. I don't ask for it. I do ask for his patience though because I will leave messes like washing, floors etc for the days off. Essentially I don't ask you to do anything but don't complain when I can't, if that makes sense. The only expectation is that he treats me with kindness and respect. 
My issue is that this effort from him seems to have dropped off. For example, I will often come home to him on the computer playing games and nothing will be out thawing for dinner so I'll take something out, thaw it, cook it for us, clean the mess made then pour myself into bed. Or he'll wash his clothes and not put mine on so at the end of the week on my only day off I'm left doing piles of laundry. He'll spend hours in bed and not do things around the house so I will do it and he complains that it's not to his standard. This has been ongoing for a few months now and I never complained about it. Just got what I could done, when I could. I figured he's depressed and needed to speak with the doctor so I gave him grace. I work, I cook, I clean, I am financially responsible for the majority of the household bills and I still find ways to make him feel valued. I'll make him a coffee and sit it on the bedside for him. I'll take care of all appointments, I'll get him anything he asks for, I'll pay for games for him because I know that it is his escape from the mundane. I do so much for him in little ways to show that I love him. I knew that he wouldn't be able to afford a Christmas gift for me, so I told him when he asked what I wanted that I don't mind what I'm given, I would be happy to just  spend a day together as that would be more meaningful than
any gift. Unfortunately I was working on the day so I told him that I would like to organise a night out for us. We agreed on this evening. I woke up at 5am today, drove an hour and a half to my job. Worked 9 hours. Drove home. I was excited for an evening out. The first things he said when I walked through the door was ""we need XYZ and I'll be honest with you, I don't feel like going"" this irritated me but I left it alone. I then mentioned we could get it on the way back from our evening out. He then proceeded to tell me that he didn't feel like that either. Okay. Fine. I'm disappointed but really not surprised. It was obvious I was disappointed because I quietly said it's okay and walked out of the room. He then tells me ""get pissy all you like, it doesn't make sense going out"" I told him that I'm disappointed and that I was looking forward to it but I don't want it to be an issue so could we drop it. That was when he started telling me that he's sick of my moods and that all I do is complain and it's no wonder he doesn't want to go out with me. I have no idea where this came from because i honestly didn't care so much about going out. It was more about the accumulation of zero effort from him... he missed the point all together. I tried to defend myself and explain that I am not upset about not going out, rather that his lack of effort lately is telling me that I am not appreciated or valued by him. This is when he started to minimise everything I do and asked me ""what do you bring to the table for me to appreciate"" and that ""everything is always about you and how you feel and what you want"" 
I got angry at this point. I then listed everything I do on-top of work, pointed out that in 3 years he hasn't had a job, told him that his gaming seems more important than being a productive member of the household and that none of what he ""brings to the table"" is worth the effort I put in to making our home, relationship and life work. I told him that nothing could be about what I want or feel because what I want is a man, not a child and what I feel is used.

I know that he likely is projecting because he is depressed and feels stuck but I am feeling used. I am tired. I feel undervalued. And I'm sitting here sobbing wondering why I'm not valued enough to even be a blip on his radar. To top things off, I just found out that he took money from the joint account to buy himself something for Christmas (because the $1000 I spent wasn't enough) but didn't even think to get me something small for the day.

I’m trying to understand what’s going on with my sleep/energy and would appreciate some outside perspective.

My situation:

\-I sleep what should be enough hours

\-I wake up feeling physically awake but mentally offline

\-It takes hours to feel normal

\-Coffee in the morning barely helps

\-Even walking or going to the gym early doesn’t really “switch me on”

\-As soon as I eat, I noticeably improve (sometimes quite fast)

\-I snore a lot, according to others



Important details:

\-This is not just after bad nights... it’s frequent

\-I don’t usually eat sweets or sugar

\-Im not depressed, just extremely slow to start the day

\-Energy improves later in the day



I’m wondering:

Could this be sleep apnea?

Or something metabolic (blood sugar, cortisol, etc.)?

Has anyone had a similar pattern where food helps more than caffeine?



I know Reddit isn’t a diagnosis... just trying to understand whether I should push for a sleep study or look elsewhere first.

If you said “2025 is my year,” I hope you’re okay. I really do. Because everyone I know who said that (myself included) got humbled in ways we didn’t even know were possible. By August, we were all walking around like emotionally bankrupt zombies, clutching  coffee and trauma like it was a personality trait.

I started the year with a plan. Not even a delusional one. Just a humble, well-organized Notion board and a few whispered affirmations. I wasn’t trying to become a millionaire or find the love of my life. I just wanted to sleep better, drink more water, and maybe stop spiraling every time my landlord texted “Hi.”

But the year had hands.  
Quarter 1: Emotional chaos.  
Quarter 2: Financial chaos.  
Quarter 3: Existential dread and a mysterious rash.  
Q4? I’m just a girl with a cracked phone screen, a dwindling data bundle, and a deep, unshakable fatigue that no amount of sleep can fix.

And the worst part? It wasn’t just me. Everyone I know was tired. Not just sleepy-tired. Existentially tired. “I haven’t felt joy since March” type of tired or “I’m not even sad, I’m just... buffering” kind of tired. We were all walking around like NPCs in a game that forgot to load the next quest.

So no. I’m not claiming 2026. I’m not manifesting. I’m not journaling. I’m not doing a vision board. I’m entering the year like a suspicious raccoon.... quiet, cautious, and ready to bite if necessary 😂.

I want to be slow. I want to be deliberate. I want to move like someone who’s been burned before and now reads the fine print on every “opportunity.” I want to be the kind of tired that doesn’t mean defeat, but wisdom. The kind that says, “I’ve seen things, I’ve learned, and I’m not rushing anymore.”

And before the motivational speakers crawl into the comments with “you just need to change your mindset” or “you just need money” or “you just need a man” or “you just need sex” 😒—please. Everyone needs something. But I’m not on your page telling you what you need. I’m just expressing my chaos. I haven’t diagnosed yours.

I know what I want. I know what I’m building. And if someone doesn’t feel like I’m right, that’s not my burden to carry. I’m not here to convince anyone. I’m just here to post, vent, and have fun. Believe what you want 😏.

That’s it. That’s the post.

This is only my second post ever, and my first in a long time. I just finished arranging my coffee setup and I wanted to share this as I'm quite proud of it. It took me about 3 months to get this far from just the coffee machine to all this with the grinder. It is quite the rabbit hole as everyone claims it to be here. Thanks to my girlfriend, I was able to (More like, had to xD) set a monthly budget for my purchases and stay excited for new accessories from time to time.

My current setup:

* Sage Bambino Plus (stock portafilter for now)
* Eureka Mignon Specialista
* MHW-3Bomber: Astra Tamper, Cube 2.0 Weighing Scale, Dosing Funnel, Yu Cyclone WDT (got a lot of this on the current winter/Christmas sales, and the Espresso Measuring Cups came free with the order!)
* Normcore Magnetic Dosing Cup
* Amazon finds: Silicone mat set (16€), water spray bottle with basic WDT and dosing cup (8€)

I've been following Coffee Kev and James Hoffmann for tips so far, which has been super helpful!

What do you guys think?

Also, recommendations on where to buy good coffee beans in Germany would be nice. I just bought the coffee beans in the video from the speciality section of the Edeka near my house. Before I got the grinder, I was getting some beans ground from Tchibo. I generally buy based on the description written on the beans and try to find out what I like. I'm quite new to it—only 3 months in. Any tips and suggestions are welcome.

Seeing a lot of places with big price increases. 1-2€ per item in some cases. 

There was a nice Mexican place near my old job and I would go once a month when I was in the office. Went in November and tapped the card and noticed it was 15.50€ for my usual order. I always pay on Revolut so looked back and had been 13€ the previous two times I went in, prior to October budget announcment.

I am a bit of a creature of habit and usually order the same things in the same places so started looking back. 

I visit my family once a month and we all get together and usually get a big take away. Chipper or Chinese. 

Looked back at what I was paying before and easily 1-2 euro increase on most dishes in November vs September and before.

Was even in with a friend getting a coffee in a place that had signs up about how the need the vat cut to survive and noticed prices had gone up (although I stopped getting coffee here months before because rhe owner was a knob).

Anyone else notice this with hospitality? Kind of feels like a right middle finger to customers to complain about needing a vat cut to survive then upping the prices after getting on.

We even decided to get an apartment together after college to save money while we started our careers. For the most part, its been great. We have a lot of the same interests and living together has been an easy transition.

However, Nate has always been more into the party scene than I have. Ill have a few drinks on the weekend, but Nate likes to go hard. Ive never judged him for it, but Ive always tried to keep that part of his life separate from our shared space.

Until last weekend. I came home from visiting my parents to find Nate and a bunch of his party buddies in our living room, music blasting, empty bottles and cans everywhere. Whatever, not the first time hes thrown a rager without giving me a heads up.

But then I noticed something on the coffee table. Lines of white powder, razor blades, straws. Nate saw me looking and just laughed, saying dont worry bro, its just a little blow, want a bump?

I sort of lost it. I told everyone to get out, now. Nate tried to calm me down but I wasnt having it. I yelled at him, saying I couldnt believe he would bring hard drugs into our home. That it wasnt just disrespectful, it was illegal and could get us both in serious trouble.
Nate got defensive, saying it was his apartment too and he could do what he wanted. He said I needed to loosen up and stop being such a buzzkill.

Since then, things have been super tense. Weve barely spoken. Im seriously considering telling him he needs to find a new place to live. I love him like a brother, but I feel like he crossed a major line.

But part of me wonders if Im overreacting. I mean, its not like Nates some junkie. He just likes to party sometimes. And hes right, it is his space too. I would never bring cops to our place, so maybe Im being a hypocrite by allowing underage drinking but drawing the line at cocaine.

Im really torn. On one hand, I dont want to throw away a lifelong friendship over one incident. But on the other, Im not comfortable living with hard drugs, period. It goes against my values and frankly scares me a bit.

1pyjlws,https://www.reddit.com/r/montenegro/comments/1pyjlws/montenegro_has_lost_a_star/,Montenegro has lost a star.,"If you arrive at the Podgorica bus terminal with your suitcases and a hint of excitement on your face, taxi drivers will instantly recognize you. They'll smile, offer to take you to the Clock Tower – for 10 euros, of course.

Having spent six months here as a young woman, I can say I've almost completely lost my social trust. It was summer when I first arrived. The city was lighter. People seemed more open, more fun, more friendly. You could manage without speaking Montenegrin (basically Serbian), but no one could guarantee you were truly safe. Even highly skilled people – engineers, professionals with almost ten years of experience – felt their patience slowly wearing thin.

There's a feeling that people are trapped in a kind of nonverbal social manipulation contract. Podgorica is a small city. Everyone knows everyone, but no one really cares. If you're short – man or woman – you're unlikely to be taken seriously. Behind many big egos, there's usually very little.

No matter where you come from, there's usually someone willing to exploit your labor. They'll happily consume your time, energy, and ideas, and won't give you a penny in return. The moment they realize you might be more talented or ambitious than them, they'll exclude you. In this country of less than 600,000 people, social status rules everything.

Billboards, events, glamorous ""startups""? Most of it feels like window dressing; more about looks and backlinks than real value or progress.

Housing is a trap in itself. There are hundreds of empty apartments with shutters down, yet rents for foreigners hover around the local minimum wage, and almost nothing is cheaper. Racism isn't usually loud or overt; it's subtle. You can have coffee side-by-side and still feel it's among you.

Alcohol, gambling, and the mentality that comes with them seep into daily life. Jokes are often based on belittling others. It's the default sense of humor.

Public spaces rarely feel safe or truly inviting. Once, while sitting in a cafe, an elderly man stared directly at me, exposing himself. The staff quietly escorted me away and offered me a free coffee, as if to erase the incident.

Taxi drivers have crossed the line on numerous occasions: making unwanted comments, pressuring me to give them my number, turning a simple ride into an unpleasant experience. Some even treated the ride like a mini-selection process for marriage.

The city isn't designed for people to exist comfortably outside. There are no picnic tables in the parks because cafes need you to sit and spend money. Podgorica feels like a luxury prison: whether you go out or stay in, your options are strangely limited.

If you come here to build something or make a difference, you quickly learn that many people don't actually want the game to change. Because if the hat falls off, everyone can suddenly see who's been bald all this time.

Talk to engineers or so-called ""elites"" about ventures, and most will look at you as if you're speaking another language. There's very little motivation, very little curiosity, very little long-term vision.

Women survive by silently submitting to male dominance: they dress in ways that make men look good, they follow unwritten rules to protect their ""reputation,"" they have children not just out of desire but as a social necessity, and yet they are expected to continue acting as if nothing has happened.

It wasn't a huge coloy, still miffed that i failed their city (gonna have the green worm arrow after me). Atleast they had a longer life than they would've in the bait shop i got them from, so i atleast gae them a \*chance\* :/

It most likely got too dry, or had too much coffee/lack of food(had a fly issue earlier, so decided to keep them on a mostly diet). Not 100% sure, some off balance feed issue, or earlier issue that just happened to surface.

Well, what's what is what, but, the question is:

Should i prep new stuff(egg carton, leaves, etc) in a different container, then mix it in with the old stuff, or should i remove all of the bin content and then re-build the base?

I was thinking the first option as there might be smol ones/eggs in there somewhere, and i'd rather save any possible survivors. Any ideas/thoughts appreciated!

I have minimal experience with barefoot shoes (I have a pair of Altras though, which are not barefoot but still foot-shaped).

I would like a pair of cute, everyday shoes. I  want them just for existing in them, not for running or long walks, but going out for coffee, sitting at work (casual is fine), chores, etc. Here are my requirements:

\- I need the shoes to come with removable inserts or space for them because I use custom insoles for a medical issue. I can size up, but I get self-conscious because I am a taller woman and whenever I size up, I feel like my feet look too big (I know it's silly, but I can't help feeling this way).

\- My feet are shallow (sandal straps are always very loose on me), and my toes don't splay (I also have a bunion on one foot), so I don't need extra wide toe boxes, regular foot shaped would work fine. Edit to add: I also have a second longer toe, so shoes that have that wide big toe space will just give me empty space that will never be filled by my toes. A rounder shape would fit my foot shape more.

\- The shoe needs to be vegan.

\- I am in Europe, and would prefer to buy from the EU to remove the need for paying extra for customs tax.

Does anyone know of any cute shoes that would match these requirements? Thank you if you read all this!",1,1767006165.0,barefootshoestalk,4,1.0,False

1pyjiap,https://i.redd.it/hcu5plz1k4ag1.jpeg,"AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8 Core, 16 Thread Desktop Processor","So you are looking at the **AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D** and wondering if it is actually worth the hype. I get it. Nobody wants to drop good money on a CPU and end up with something that performs like a tired office PC trying to run Baldur’s Gate 3 on life support. The good news is this one is different. This chip delivers some seriously impressive gains and it finally fixes what annoyed me about older X3D CPUs: heat issues and zero overclocking freedom. Yep, AMD finally listened.

Before we go deeper, here is the link to check current pricing if you want it on standby while you read: [**https://amzn.to/493FsPy**](https://amzn.to/493FsPy)

Ever wondered what happens when AMD takes the 7800X3D, cranks the clocks higher, adds smarter cache placement for better cooling, then hands over full overclocking freedom? You get the **Ryzen 7 9800X3D**, a gaming monster with real upgrades, not recycled marketing buzzwords.

# Why the Ryzen 7 9800X3D Matters Right Now

If you want **the fastest gaming CPU for 1080p and high refresh rate setups**, this chip pretty much sits alone at the top. Reviewers call it the king for a reason. It is built on AMD’s **Zen 5 architecture** with 8 cores and 16 threads, plus that famous **3D V Cache** that turns average gaming performance into smooth and stable frame delivery.

The big deal is the new inverted cache placement. Instead of stacking cache on top of the cores like before, AMD put it underneath. This means better cooling and higher clock speeds. Sounds simple, but this change lets the 9800X3D run faster and cooler than the 7800X3D even though its base clock is **4.7 GHz** and it boosts up to **5.2 GHz**.

And yes, I know what you are thinking. Why did AMD not do this sooner?

# Key Specs At A Glance

Want the important stuff fast? Here you go:

* **Zen 5 architecture**
* **8 cores and 16 threads**
* **4.7 GHz base clock and up to 5.2 GHz boost**
* **96 MB of L3 cache thanks to 3D V Cache**
* **TSMC 4nm process**
* **AM5 socket support**
* **DDR5 support up to 5600 MHz**
* **120W TDP with surprisingly efficient real world power draw**

**Bold takeaway**: This thing is built for gaming first, productivity second, no apologies.

# What Makes It Special: 3D V Cache, But Smarter

Older X3D chips performed well, but they hit thermal walls pretty fast. The 9800X3D fixes that with the new inverted cache design. Having the cores closer to the heat spreader improves cooling. This allows higher frequencies and actual overclocking potential.

**In short terms**:

* Better cooling
* Faster clocks
* No thermal throttling tantrums
* Yes, you can finally overclock an X3D chip

Ever wanted buttery smooth 1 percent lows so your gameplay does not stutter like a 2006 laptop? This CPU does that.

# Gaming Performance: This Is Where It Flexes

If you mainly game at 1080p or 1440p, especially with a high refresh monitor, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is insane. It regularly pulls **8 to 15 percent gains over the 7800X3D**. It also beats Intel’s newest Core Ultra 9 chips by **20 to 40 percent** in CPU bound titles while using less power.

**Real world experience**:

* Baldur’s Gate 3 feels instantly smoother
* Microsoft Flight Simulator does not chew the CPU alive anymore
* Far Cry 6 averages jump like they finally had coffee
* 1 percent lows improve more than the average FPS which is what actually matters

If you want bragging rights in multiplayer games, this chip basically hands them to you.

# Productivity: Good, Not Legendary

This is a gaming CPU first. In productivity workloads, like Blender and Cinebench, it is around **15 to 20 percent faster** than the 7800X3D but it will not beat Ryzen 9 chips with more cores. If you care about heavy editing or 3D rendering more than gaming, this is not the best pick. But if gaming comes first and work comes second, it is more than enough.

FYI, IMO that is a fair tradeoff for this level of gaming performance :)

# Power and Temperatures

Despite its 120W TDP, real world gaming usually sits around 60 to 80 watts. That is wild efficiency. It stays cooler than the 7800X3D even as it runs faster. This means you do not need an exotic cooler or a case that costs more than your GPU.

I ran it with a mid range air cooler and temps stayed totally reasonable.

# Who Should Actually Buy This CPU

**Buy it if**:

* You mainly game in 1080p or 1440p
* You use a high refresh monitor like 144 Hz or 240 Hz
* You want the fastest gaming performance available
* You plan to stick with AM5 until at least 2027

**Skip it if**:

* You do heavy editing or workstation workloads
* You want 12 or 16 core CPUs for productivity
* You are trying to save money and do not care about peak gaming performance

# FAQ

# Is the Ryzen 7 9800X3D worth it for gaming?

Yes. If gaming is your priority, this is the best CPU on the market for pure gaming performance.

# Does it run hot like older X3D chips?

No. The inverted cache placement helps temps stay under control. Cooling is easier than before.

# Can you overclock it?

Yes. This is the first X3D CPU with real overclocking support.

# Is it future proof?

As far as CPUs can be. AMD confirmed AM5 support through 2027.

# Final Thoughts

The **AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D** delivers what gamers actually wanted. More speed, better thermals, and actual overclocking control. It is not the best workstation CPU, but it is easily the best gaming CPU right now. It smooths out 1 percent lows, boosts FPS, and keeps heat under control. No gimmicks, just performance.

1pyjdj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pyjdj6/am_i_being_unreasonable_hobbies/,Am I being unreasonable? Hobbies.,"Me (45F). Husband (45M) and two children >5 <10.  

My husband runs his own business. I work in a stable government job, not earning massively well but I’d say more than a third of our family income. 

My husband works a lot and the demands of his business stress him out a lot. I like my job and there is still plenty of growth ahead of me. 

I stayed home with the kids when they were not yet in school. That was a mutual decision based on the fact that we liked that for our kids and there wasn’t really any work in the area that would make it worth putting the kids in daycare. 

I didn’t so much as buy myself a coffee in those days. Whenever my husband wanted to go and hang out with friends or go fishing or go and play music: fine. Go. 

Now that the kids are bigger, I picked my own musical hobby back up. I love playing and I have particularly loved getting involved with the music school. It’s something I enjoy just for the sake of learning something new. 

Over the past year, I have been taking a weekly lesson. It would be during dinner/bedtime and I’d always make sure that there’s something easy to pop into the oven for dinner or have dinner made. I’d still make lunch boxes. I’d be out of the house for 2 hours max. 

My husband has continuously met that with snide remarks that basically come down to: he doesn’t get to do any of that anymore now that his business has expanded. I work a cushy job and just get to do whatever I want. 

He makes zero time for hobbies. I have told him numerous times that I am happy to make some lifestyle sacrifices if it means that he lightens up a bit. He doesn’t want to. He likes the money and wants to earn more. It’s not helping his mood. 

The music school had asked me recently if I would consider getting on their books as a casual teacher and take a class here and there. 

I put that on the table this week to discuss, putting it as simple as “this is what they said, what do you think?” And he lost it. He got mad and threw lots of F bombs around in front of the kids. I asked him repeatedly to stop but he wouldn’t. 

In his anger he said that he’d pay me more to stay home with the kids than anyone else ever could. He works his guts out and I want to go do some ladida music stuff when I should be a parent at home. There was more but that’s what his main, poorly worded argument gets to. 

The whole exploding in front of the kids is one thing and it’s cause for concern. He doesn’t get violent but he says mean stuff. 

However, am I being unreasonable wanting something for myself purely for the sake of “it makes me happy”? He makes it seem like I am being selfish for wanting a hobby while he is out earning the bulk of the money for our family. 

Aside from the fact that I am weighing up how much more of his anger I want to put up with in this marriage, am I being unreasonable for wanting a hobby that would take me away from home one night a week?

1pyjc6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1pyjc6d/i_dont_even_know_whether_to_laugh_or_scream/,I don't even know whether to laugh or scream anymore,"So, my MIL has always been a controlling, immature person who takes any boundary as a personal insult, but things have reached a new level of ridiculousness a couple of days ago and I don't even know whether to laugh or scream anymore.

A bit of a recap of the stunts she has pulled, for context (also sorry for possibly bad formatting, I'm writing this on my phone rn):

- We were celebrating my birthday in our new home, she proceeded to take over everything like we were at her place and tried to tell everyone what to do. Upon being told that she should sit down and let me handle it, she got offended, of course.

- We alternate the days we spend with our families around Christmas time because we just don't have the time to meet everyone every year. Which means, we'll spend Christmas Eve with his family in year 1, with mine in year 2, his in year 3... You get it. She threw a tantrum mthebfirst year we celebrated with my family because she didn't get to see us as much as she wanted (which would've been the entire 3 days of Christmas). Door slamming, screaming and guilt tripping ensued.

- Treats SO's younger brother (4 years younger, good and well within his adult years) as the golden child and expects us to follow suit. He never has to help with anything, while she just expects us to drive over there and help, while golden boy sits in his room gaming. He's too lazy to get his driver's license, so she drives him everywhere and expects everyone to do it, too. She honestly expected us to drive over there twice a day to water her plants and glfeed her pets while she was abroad, despite the fact that golden boy *lives there*, because ""he doesn't do it anyway"".

- incessant calls about the most miniscule shit because she wants control and instant information. She also thinks everyone owes it to her to pick up her constant calls because she does so, too (the big difference is, we call for emergencies, and we don't call every single day for completely unimportant stuff). It's not like she's lonely- she has a friend group, her husband, her self-made Peter Pan golden boy. She just wants access and control.

- called us *20 times* in a day because she was pissed that we didn't pick up after her second call for nothing in a day. This was when we were renovating our home, so we stayed in SO's childhood room for a few weeks until we were done; she proceeded to come screaming about how she always picks up the phone, then threw a temper tantrum upon being told that unlike her, we don't call every day, let alone 20 times in a day. Ran into the kitchen to throw Tupperware while screaming, them cut the power on the upper story of the house to try to punish us. Then acted like nothing ever happened and expected us to have dinner with her. 

- Our place is the second story of SO's old family farm house. His aunt lives in the first story (moved down after SO's grandparents died). Due to it all having been one big family home, the door to our story used to be a regular door with a handle on every side and no lock. MIL took this as an invitation to come over and let herself in anytime.

- when she doesn't get the instant access she wants, she used to come over and hammer on our door to force us to interact, then got angry when we didn't open the door and ignored her knocking.

- due to my work, I regularly get vouchers for 20% off shoes. I myself get a 30% discount anyway, so those are for friends and family. She constantly asks for more vouchers, completely disregarding the fact that she's not the only person in my life who I'd like to benefit from them. 

- she is incredibly manipulative, constantly tries to emotionally blackmail SO, can't handle criticism *at all* (think pouty toddler level and *of course* the inevitable ""fine, I guess I'm sooo bad you all hate me."")

All in all, she has massive main character syndrome and seems to think that everyone in her life is just there to aid her in her personal movie, while also tying her entire self worth to being needed and never being criticised.

So, with that out of the way, moving on to the even two days after Christmas Eve:

A day before, while we were visiting my family, she kept messaging SO about how she had forgotten to give us a hug the day before and we should come over so she can do that the next day. I was already irritated then because I've been feeling for a good while that she doesn't like us spending time with my family instead of her and seemingly needs to ""one up"" my fam by seeing us the day after. Anyway, SO told her we'd have to see, we also did forget something at her place. The following day, she kept messaging and messaging him from morning till evening, again ""when are you coming?"" ""Your brother won!"" (They were playing some game apparently), ""nice how you're not texting back"" ""hello?"" Then proceeded to call again. She always calls me when SO doesn't pick up, like I'm his secretary, so of course I didn't pick up either. SO was sitting right next to me,nohnoring her calls, because he was just done with her constant need for communication. Which led to- the message. It's on his phone so I can't post a screenshot but this is the gist of it:

""Hello Y-
Too bad you aren't picking up again. You always want me to pick up when you call me and need something,but when I need you,n you never pick up. I don't want that anymore, I need to protect my peace, so I'm blocking you and R. If there's anything you want to talk about, there's still the landline.""

Wellll...

1: we only call her for emergencies, which is like every couple of months. Every single other call is SO calling her back when she once again called for bullshit or the regular social calls she lives off of 

2: we never throw a tantrum if she doesn't pick up, so what's this ""you want me to"". It's a plain lie.

3: she's the one wanting constant access, then blocks us, actively blocking herself from access. I knew that this would get interesting because she *would* find some mental gymnastics way to try and still keep her access. What's that saying about having your cake and eating it, too? 

But, we decided that, okay, if she ""needs to protect her peace"", we'll give her the space she asks for and simply dropped the rope.

 Aaand I was right. The next day, she called via landline. Of course we didn't pick up, I mean, come on. That's highschool level bullshit. The rope remained right where it was- dropped. But it gets better: she came over. Apparently ""to visit Aunt"", but isn't it weird how she told Aunt ""let's ask them if they'd like to join us for coffee!"" Told Aunt that it wasn't a good time and stayed where we were, MIL left after an hour. 

How can a goddamn adult woman in her late 50s be so childish, immature, manipulative and then expect us to reward her for her shit behavior! This while situation is so stupid I feel like I'm living in a sitcom.",17,1767005464.0,JUSTNOMIL,4,1.0,False

1pyj82j,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pyj82j/girl_im_dating_stopped_texting/,Girl I'm dating stopped texting,"I [20M] met this girl [20F] about a month ago in uni, she's pretty shy, but we texted and we had great chemistry. We share interests, have a similar sense of humour. About a week in of texting I asked her out to a coffee and she agreed. 

We've had three dates so far, and that was enough to confirm my feelings for her. We hug, and have physical touch, but we haven't kissed yet nor confessed feelings. Things were going really great and there was clear chemistry. We're both back in our home towns for Christmas break though.

Well, here's where the trouble begins: We were texting pretty consistently ever since we met, we'd send each other reels, goodnight texts, and we used to have hour long conversations over insta.

But for the past week or so, she hasn't initiated a single text. I'd send her stuff, and she'd react or reply with short responses, but she would make no effort to continue the conversation. So I decided to stop initiating after days of that, because clearly she's either busy or I'm bothering her in some way. 

So we haven't communicated since Christmas. Not a single text. And I don't want to message her like a desperate ex, I don't want to push or come off as needy. And it's strange, because she'd initiate conversations all the time when we just started out.

At this point, I'd rather she tell me outright if she wants to keep this going or not, especially when she showed clear interest in person. I'd much rather just get some clarification from her, and move on if this clearly isn't working out.",2,1767005053.0,dating_advice,7,0.75,False

King size beds are no longer just about sleeping comfortably—they’ve become the emotional and visual anchor of modern homes. From white-gold elegance to hand-carved teak masterpieces and ultra-luxurious round beds, today’s designs blur the line between furniture and art.

What I’m noticing more and more is how homeowners are willing to invest in **statement beds** that define the mood of the entire room. Lighting, wall panels, rugs, and even ceiling designs now revolve around the bed. Comfort still matters (arguably more than ever), but craftsmanship, materials, and presence are just as important.

Below are **15 luxury king size bed designs trending in 2026** that perfectly balance premium style, comfort, and craftsmanship. I’d love to hear which ones resonate with you—and which feel a bit *too* bold.[u/TrendingReddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/TrendingReddits/)

1pyj1no,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1pyj1no/calling_the_health_department/,Calling the Health Department,"Hey guys, 

I wanted to know if anyone has called the health department regarding their work unit. Our unit has multiple rooms closed due to ants and roaches and I’ve been looking into calling the health department since management isn’t doing much to address it. We’re killing roaches in the hallways, roaches in the staff break room. A couple months ago we got a new coffee machine since a family of roaches was found in it whenever someone went to put a new coffee container in it. I love my job and I’m scared that I’ll lose it by calling the health department even if it’s anonymous. I hate that we have to go through this. I’m on a peds unit for gods sake.

1pyj1ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1pyj1ej/moving_to_thailand_soon_havent_been_yet/,Moving to Thailand Soon. Haven’t Been Yet.,"Hi everyone, quick question.

I’m thinking of moving to Thailand next month. I’ve never been there, but I’ve done extensive research (watched two YouTube videos and skimmed half a blog post from 2018).

A few details I’ll need help with:

• Which exact place should I live if I want it quiet but lively, local but international, walkable but spacious, cheap but luxury, social but private, authentic but with Western coffee?

• What is the best condo in all of Thailand, preferably under $320/month, with ocean and mountain views, perfect Wi-Fi, no traffic, no tourists, and no rainy season?

• Will I automatically make close friends, or should I bring some with me?

• Is there a simple long-term visa I can get without paperwork, income, age requirements, or commitment? Please summarize all options in one comment.

• Do I need to learn Thai, or will most people speak English once they hear my accent?

• Is Thailand safe everywhere at all times, including at 3am after I’ve had drinks?

• What do people do for work? (I will not be working.)

Follow-up question:

Is Thailand basically Bali, Japan, Portugal, and Mexico combined, but cheaper?

Thanks in advance. I’m moving either way.",0,1767004400.0,ThailandTourism,43,0.47,False

I’m currently in a strange situation with this one girl, during summer the was this girl that I kept seeing on my way to work every other day etc she started smiling a lot when she saw me waving at me when she saw me etc… so I took the initiative to ask her out for coffee which she accepted we talked for 3 hours the date went really well the was awkward moments she was smiling talking a lot playing with her joking around basically she spoke for like 70% of  the time. (Obviously I payed for everything) after the date I messages her of course saying it was nice to finally meet her and talk to her in person, she said the same and said it was a very enjoyable evening.

Then after like 2 weeks we had another date, I took her too a very nice restaurant also gave her a small gift as it was one week before Christmas and once again everything went very well we talked for 3 hours laughed made jokes she talked about her life, life stories made jokes laughed a lot seemed very comfortable and talkative too asked me deep questions like am I certain about what I do and the future of it that was the first question and also gave me advice on life and how I should approach certain things life work etc.

The thing is she never texts first nothing at all we don’t text at all it’s always me that has too message first etc… which I don’t mind but it’s kinda confusing what she wants 

The question is does she like and is playing hard to get or I’m just deluded and thought she liked me not sure what I should do right now because I still see her and she smiles etc…

1pyiyy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatmoviewasthat/comments/1pyiyy5/help/,Help,I watched a film long ago in fb want the name.. actually it's s romantic film. It was in telugu or kannada I guess but between these two.. actually the hero was abt to get married or something like that. But he would come to some girls house and therevwas a shirtless scene due to coffee spilt on his shirt .. and then there was a kamasutra ad in that film which was a part of the film and the hero would react to it by showing his finger..(u can understand yourself) he would go to buy c**dom after that... So I don't remember exactly what happened after it. I want the name alone plss,1,1767004154.0,whatmoviewasthat,1,1.0,False
1pyiytg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyiytg,Bali haul,"Brother got these from bali. He is a noob so I didn't expect much but to my surprise he didn't fell into the tourist traps and got me these.

1. Kintamani beans: very popular there. Arabica beans medium dark roast, freshly roasted. This one tastes amazing. Right at top with indian speciality coffee. Very well balanced,good mouthfeel not al all bitter. The way I like for my cappuccino.

2. Alas harum robusta beans: he told me it's almost export only product. Very sought after in south korea.these are strong but not the indian kind (which is basically bitter and hits you like a train). Its smooth and creamy. Blended it with kintamani beans and I had an amazing cup.

3. Aceh gayo: again very popular plantation there. Arabica beans. This one steals the show for me. The cappuccino it made was definitely among the best I have had.",4,1767004140.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.84,False
