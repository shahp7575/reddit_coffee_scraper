1gk3c1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerWoodWorking/comments/1gk3c1q/getting_started_with_wood_choices/,Getting started with wood choices,"Hey all,

I'm  still in the planning stages. I was wondering if people can give advice/helpful links. I've never done this but would like to try.

The Idea:

I want to create a built in bookshelf. It will have a frame on the bottom, cabinets, and then bookshelves (similar to a kallax) to hold board games. I want it to look nice/professional. I want it integrated into the dining room wall. Looks matter here. I want to be able to look at it and say, a professional did this aka myself.

Approximate dimensions: L = 150'' H = 100'' D = 12""-15'' (to be finalized later)

The details:
I want to stain it over painting.
I'm unsure how I plan to finish at the moment. Probably depends on what wood I use.
I believe I want wood trim around the edges to integrate into the walls. I want a recseed toe kick. Im unsure about wood trim or crown moulding on the ceiling.
I will have access to a workshop with all the proper tools such as a joiner, planar, table saw, miter saw, etc.

I have some very high level basic questions and could use some guidance on the best approach and if I am missing anything I didn't think of.

Wood choice:
Because I want a nice, clean look at the end, I decided to go with more expensive hard wood.

A few choices that are available to me:
Ash, cherry, cypress, hickory, kentucky coffee, maple ambrosia or rock, mahogany, pecan, persimmon, red grandis, red oak, sapele, sassafrass, sycamore, walnit, and white oak.

1. I haven't looked at colors/stains yet, but out of these choices, are there any that should not be used for a bookshelf? If yes, why not?

2. I see stock unfinished cabinets for red/white oak on Home Depot. If I go a different wood, will i need to go to a proper cabinet maker and request a quote for cabinet sizes?

While I am picking a more expensive wood, I don't want costs to get out of hand either. I also want something reasonably available. I fear that if I have to go get custom quotes for cabinets, prices will soar.

3. Is it better to use wood trim or crown moulding when integrating the built in bookshelf with the home/wall? What about the ceiling?

4. If I use wood that is not stocked in Home Depot or Lowes, how do I get trim pieces for that wood? I have plenty of lumber stores to choose different wood from but unsure on the trims.


5. Do I need a backing or should I let the wall color show through?what looks better to integrate it?",1,1730801059.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,1.0,False
1gk3att,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yakima/comments/1gk3att/looking_for_places_to_gather_socially_that_are/,"Looking for places to Gather socially that are free, quiet, all-ages, and open late!","I play board games. Before COVID there was a group of up to 30 people that would meet every Friday to play games at Northtown (the Train station). There were lots of tables, it was free\*, and they were open until Midnight. They had folding tables they let us use. They let us bring in dinner from other places. And they did have a room available to reserve for $10/hour which we used on occasion. It was pretty perfect.

Then COVID and it was harder to meet up. 

Ever since then a smaller group of us have been trying to find a new place to replace the Train Station (which has changed hands and is much less friendly, I'm told). Our requirements are rather specific, though I think we are open to compromise on some things, perfect being the enemy of good, and all.

* **Free**. We don't mind paying for services offered by a place, but paying for the place itself is too costly.
* **All-ages**. People got kids, and even the people without kids recognize that playing games with kids is part of the appeal.
* **Quiet**. -Ish. Doesn't have to be library quiet, but we need to be able to communicate.
* **Open Late**. Games can be a time-consuming thing, and we like to be able to finish the ones we start. 
* **Large Tables**. Big enough for a large group. And ideally enough of them for several large groups.
* **Public**. The above list could describe your living room or kitchen, but we want to open up to inviting the public again, so the space needs to be somewhere that's okay letting just about anyone in without making us sign a liability waiver.

The kinds of places we're looking at are generally coffee shops, restaurants, libraries, churches... We even looked at some of the Granges but they cost too much.

The problem with most obvious places is that either they don't have the table space, or they have the space but can't promise it's available, or they can promise it's available if we pay a deposit. 

I am hoping this group knows a place we haven't thought of.

1gk33z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalNomadTurkiye/comments/1gk33z7/budgetfriendly_dining_in_t√ºrkiye/,Budget-Friendly Dining in T√ºrkiye üçΩÔ∏èüáπüá∑,"One of the best parts of living in T√ºrkiye is experiencing its incredible cuisine without spending a fortune! T√ºrkiye offers a wide variety of delicious, affordable options that allow digital nomads to eat well while keeping to a budget. Here are some tips and recommendations to help you enjoy T√ºrkiye‚Äôs culinary delights without breaking the bank.



**1. Street Food and Local Markets**

* Simit: T√ºrkiye‚Äôs beloved sesame-covered bread ring, simit, is a budget-friendly snack you can find on nearly every street corner. Perfect with a tea, it‚Äôs a filling option for just a few liras.
* Midye Dolma: Stuffed mussels are a must-try and are often sold by street vendors in places like ƒ∞stanbul‚Äôs Karak√∂y or ƒ∞zmir‚Äôs Alsancak neighborhoods.
* Balƒ±k Ekmek: If you‚Äôre in a coastal city, don‚Äôt miss this classic fish sandwich. It‚Äôs affordable, tasty, and a filling lunch option‚Äîespecially popular in ƒ∞stanbul‚Äôs Emin√∂n√º district.

Tip: Visiting local markets (pazar) is a great way to stock up on fresh fruits, vegetables, and snacks at lower prices than supermarkets.



**2. Explore T√ºrkiye‚Äôs Meze Culture for Affordable Variety**

* What is Meze?: Mezes are small dishes typically served as appetizers, but they make a perfect shared meal. Look for local meyhane (taverns) that offer a meze plate option, allowing you to try multiple dishes affordably.
* Popular Mezes: Try haydari (a yogurt dip with garlic), ezme (spicy tomato and pepper salad), and patlƒ±can salatasƒ± (smoked eggplant salad) for a true taste of Turkish flavors.

Tip: Many restaurants will have meze platters as part of a fixed menu, making it a great way to sample more dishes without overspending.



**3. Try Lokantas for Homestyle Cooking on a Budget**

* What is a Lokanta?: Lokantas are casual eateries that serve traditional Turkish home-cooked meals at affordable prices. These places are usually self-service, with a variety of hot dishes displayed, from stews to rice dishes.
* Popular Dishes: Look for classics like kuru fasulye (white bean stew), pilav (rice), and mercimek √ßorbasƒ± (lentil soup). Meals at lokantas are filling, nutritious, and wallet-friendly.

Tip: Lokantas are popular lunch spots for locals, so going during lunch hours will give you the best variety and freshness.



**4. Choose Pide and Lahmacun for Affordable, Satisfying Meals**

* Pide: Often referred to as ‚ÄúTurkish pizza,‚Äù pide is an oven-baked flatbread topped with ingredients like cheese, vegetables, or meat. It‚Äôs filling, tasty, and easy on the budget.
* Lahmacun: This thin-crust flatbread topped with minced meat, herbs, and spices is a street-food favorite that‚Äôs both affordable and satisfying. Try it with a squeeze of lemon and a side of ayran (a yogurt-based drink) for the full experience.

Tip: Many local bakeries and casual restaurants serve pide and lahmacun, making it easy to find wherever you are in T√ºrkiye.



**5. Visit Turkish Bakeries for Breakfast on a Budget**

* B√∂rek: This savory pastry is often filled with cheese, spinach, or minced meat and is a popular breakfast choice. Pair it with Turkish tea for a simple yet delicious start to the day.
* Poƒüa√ßa: Another breakfast staple, poƒüa√ßa is a soft, flaky pastry typically filled with cheese or olives and available at most bakeries for a very reasonable price.
* Tip: Look for local bakeries in your neighborhood for fresh b√∂rek and poƒüa√ßa in the mornings‚Äîthey‚Äôre inexpensive and filling!



**6. Doner Kebabs and Quick Meals at Fast-Food Chains**

* D√∂ner: One of T√ºrkiye‚Äôs most popular street foods, d√∂ner kebabs are a go-to for an affordable and filling meal. Whether you choose it in a wrap (d√ºr√ºm) or as a sandwich, d√∂ner is a budget-friendly option for lunch or dinner.
* Turkish Fast-Food Chains: Chains like Tavuk D√ºnyasƒ± and K√∂fteci Yusuf offer good quality meals at affordable prices and are found in most cities across T√ºrkiye.

Tip: Opt for d√∂ner served with rice or fries (iskender d√∂ner) for an even more substantial meal.



**7. Drink Turkish Tea Instead of Coffee for Savings**

* √áay (Turkish Tea): Tea is a staple in T√ºrkiye, and a glass of √ßay is often much cheaper than coffee, especially at local tea houses. It‚Äôs a great way to stay caffeinated without breaking your budget.
* Ayran: This refreshing yogurt drink is a common accompaniment to meals and is both healthy and affordable.

Tip: Visiting local tea houses (√ßay bah√ßesi) is not only budget-friendly but also gives you a great opportunity to observe local culture.

1gk3324,https://i.redd.it/b0um8r7p02zd1.jpeg,3 Month New Owner Thoughts ,"I bought my first Tesla (First EV) in August and wanted to share my thoughts:

Purchased a new Model 3 2024 brand new from Tesla and drove it away with 6 miles on the clock. 

Absolutely love the car, it‚Äôs comfortable, fast and has all the tech and gadgets. 

Home charging is an absolute game changer. I‚Äôve spent ¬£70 from mid August to today‚Äôs date, charging just over 1000kwh. Previously I would spend ¬£50 a week filling my petrol car. 

Supercharging is a breeze, I‚Äôve driven two long trips and stopping for a coffee/toilet break and charging is effortless and is extremely quick and convenient, yes you pay more for charging but it is still far cheaper than fuel. 

The stalkless indicators have not been an issue at all, in fact it‚Äôs natural behaviour now. My partner who occasionally drives the car too, now finds herself trying to press the indicators on the steering wheel in her VW polo. 

Now here are a few things I HATE about the new Tesla Model 3 Highland:

1. The auto screen wipers are the worst thing I have ever used. The fact they‚Äôll replaced the rain sensor with a camera is outrageous. It‚Äôs so frustrating that I not have the auto feature completely switched off and find myself adjusting the speed manually when needed. When on auto, the wipers would either go extremely fast for the amount of rain, or not come on at all when needed. 

2. Voice control for sending messages is completely useless and again, frustrating. I thought Siri in apple CarPlay was bad but this takes the first prize.

I am quite new to Reddit. A 28 year old, female, Indian, I recently lost 12-14 kgs of weight over the course of 1.5 years with sustainable eating and incorporating Yoga, minimal strength workouts at home (2-3 days a week) and lots of walking. I weigh 69kgs now, 5feet 4 inch height. My body fat % is around 25%. I am now incorporating running 2 times a week as well. I have taken whey/whey isolate supplements in the past for 1 year and slowly tapered off as I felt my gut felt better without them. I did go from a daily intake of 80-90g protein to 50-60g and have not noticed any muscle loss. I do have pcos, I left eating meat/fish/chicken since an year, I only consume eggs. Gluten or dairy dont cause any issues, but excess of any one thing upsets my stomach. My main aim now is to lose the last 5 kgs, maintain a good balance between macros, get fitter (build more lean muscle mass), flexible and stronger. I would love to get your advice on if this meal plan looks complete and if there is anything else I can add to make it more holistic. I am finding it a bit challenging to manage protein without overloading on carbs. I do have a history of bingeing (although not diagnosed), so I avoid restricting myself too much on certain foods, so as to avoid doubling on them later.

# QR Code Coffee Machines in Caf√©s: A New Era of Customer Experience

Beyond offices, QR code coffee machines are gaining traction in caf√©s, where customer experience is paramount.

Catch yourself a big mug or cup of tea, add some drizzles of bee-honey and throw a lemon into it, as it's a nice goody to strengthen the immune system, though unfortunately I did it too late and only drank coffee and didn't want to put on my winter jacket yet. Now i'm lying in my apartment with a cold and feeling sorry for myself as I type these letters. lol


As I have said before, there is a lot of material that strongly supports our common positions and should encourage us to ask the right questions and use irrefutable arguments so that the fine white gentlemen (the worst kind of cant and pecksniffery) can no longer feel safe behind their coats, gloves and unequal positions of power.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives, they will be challenged with evidence from all sides. Unfortunately, after #metoo, other occurences came up and comprehensibly dominated the news and weakened the dynamic of metoo debates and the calls for justice. The focus was simply on Covid, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and several others. 

But in my opinion, the time to make a difference is now and more favorable than ever. Studies are easier to access than ever before, social media and A.I. also do have their good sides, journalism has voices (f.e. Tia Mitchell, Carrie Teegardin ->  https://www.npr.org/2016/08/24/491170143/atlanta-paper-investigates-doctors-who-sexually-abuse-patients ) in niches that can emerge from their shadowy existence. Media raise questions ( https://www.propublica.org/article/concerned-about-obgyn-visit-heres-what-should-happen#how-often-does-sexual-misconduct-happen-in-medicine ).  A good start but still not enough. 

The patriarchal structures that are still trying to suppress and hinder these assets and channels are more evident than ever and the spark of evidence is about to fly. I strongly believe in the chaos theory. ü¶ã Sometimes it only takes one person (Laurie Kanyok) and others recognize themselves in them. They join forces and get support (Anthony T. DiPietro). 

‚ÄúThere were numbers now,‚Äù Kanyok says. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt just me.‚Äù

1gk2xr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1gk2xr6/how_to_network/,How to network?,"Hello everyone, first post here. I have a bit of experience working live sound(around 5 gigs on a handful of different mixers, & a decade+ background in recording and playing in bands, guitar & drums) and finally got the money to build a PA system for my own gigs in order to start a live sound business. I‚Äôm confident in my abilities and the logistics, but does anyone have tips on getting gigs and working with bands or venues? Just loading in and out and mixing bands, maybe providing playlists for parties etc., not my own band. We can find our own gigs lol. I have two 12 inch speakers and two 18 inch subs, all EV and a mixer with 16 inputs; able to cover anything from a coffee shop/bar to somewhat bigger outdoor venues. I‚Äôve given business cards out before to no avail but I‚Äôm considering trying it again. Where do I start? How much do I charge? I‚Äôm willing to do some discounted or free charity gigs at first just to get my name out too. I‚Äôve reached out to a few local bands but none are serious enough to pay for a sound guy & are more likely to do backyard gigs with a behringer eurolive with no monitoring just for vocals. I have a resume and a few local connections but also want to branch out on my own. Any advice is helpful. I‚Äôd love to go out and get paid to mix bands every weekend.

1gk2wtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1gk2wtd/update_wibta_if_i_stopped_taking_out_my/,UPDATE: Wibta if I stopped taking out my girlfriends dishes ,"To start I‚Äôm just gonna answer a couple of commonly asked questions 

1; ‚ÄúWhy do you sleep separately?‚Äù I have very violent nightmares/night terrors, not sure what they‚Äôre called, both of our mattresses are next to each other but we have a bedside table between them, we sleep separately due to a really bad instance while I was having one of these night terrors, it was my idea until I could get to the bottom of the issue as I was worried about hurting her in my sleep 

2: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you eat at the table?‚Äù We live in a very small one bedroom flat, what counts as our ‚Äòdining room‚Äô is the lounge chairs and small coffee table, I usually eat out here but my gf prefers to eat in the room as she has cats that are quite food obsessed and finds it stressful to try to eat and shoo the cats away 

On to the update, we sat down and spoke about it this morning and I told her some of the things she had said were very hurtful to me and I would like to understand what was going on for her to be so upset and worked up over something very small. She apologised for what she had said and explained she‚Äôd been really stressed out with issues regarding her family and like some of you had said, to her it was a really big accomplishment and the way I had brushed it off and laughed about it had come across as though I didn‚Äôt care about what was a large thing for her to which I apologised for and explained I was just trying to de-escalate things and she understood. 

Onto the dishes, she said she knows there‚Äôs quite a mess if I‚Äôm not the one taking them out and that before she went to sleep, she had a talk with her brother and he had helped open her eyes to how it seems like she bosses me around a lot and that she doesn‚Äôt do the best job of conveying her gratitude for the things I do and she apologised that. 

I‚Äôve suggested we get a crate (like the kind people put their dogs in) for the cats so we can both eat in the dining/living area and put them in there while we‚Äôre eating so she doesn‚Äôt get overwhelmed by them and so dishes stop ending up all in our bedroom instead, she thinks it‚Äôs a good idea. 

I‚Äôve also asked her if she would be willing to go and talk to someone because I‚Äôm concerned about how emotional and aggressive she‚Äôs been lately, she‚Äôs quite averse to the idea of therapy but she‚Äôs agreed that it would be helpful and would like me to join her in couples therapy in a setting where there‚Äôs non biased opinions so she can also learn to see things from my perspective as she said she‚Äôs worried about me getting overwhelmed and becoming a nervous wreck basically. 

All in all I think the conversation went very well, we both apologised for where we had gone wrong to each other and I believe it was a very productive conversation to have! ",9,1730799072.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,2,1.0,False

1gk2wel,https://i.redd.it/dtgow8w3y1zd1.jpeg,How much we spent on furnishing our home in the first year [detailed budget breakdown],"So I finally added up all the stuff we bought in the past year, and it turns out to be ~$17K. It‚Äôs not a 100% exhaustive list but I tried to capture as much as possible.

We did not spend $17K all at once, but spread over the year, on average $1-$2K/month, which made it a lot more manageable. Some items we kept from our old apartment so those are marked as $0 but I added a column with the estimated cost from when we bought them before. 

There were a few splurges on nice things, but majority was mid range budget buys (Target, Amazon, Costco, Home Depot), and a few were Facebook Marketplace finds. We still went to Restoration Hardware and other high end furniture showrooms for ‚Äúresearch‚Äù. It made us feel a lot better for finding good deals or sales from cheaper stores. 

The first few months were stressful due to sticker shock at how expensive furniture is. And the long lead times for ordering furniture was very frustrating (some bed frames or dining tables we liked had 6-12 months wait‚Ä¶) we tried to buy stuff that was already in stock and would arrive within 2-3 weeks. 

For context we bought a new build so we did not have to spend any money on renovations. That helped a lot. We still have emergency savings just in case but it‚Äôs nice not having to shell out thousands of dollars on roof replacement or furnace or heater replacements. 

Keep in mind we are still not ‚Äúdone‚Äù furnishing. We don‚Äôt have any rugs, are missing curtains in several rooms, and have lots of blank walls to be filled with artwork. We‚Äôd like to eventually replace some of our old furniture and TV. We haven‚Äôt done anything with our backyard which is currently just all covered with mulch. But I‚Äôve let myself not have any deadline for these remaining things, since they are just nice to haves, and I like the idea of slowly upgrading our living space over the years so we always have new ways of enjoying our home. 

Anyways, I think what we spent is probably on the higher end of what you could end up spending furnishing your home. But hoping this helps give an idea of the kinds of things you might be buying in the first year.

1gk2wda,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gk2wda,First Solo travel experience - Nainital ,"I visited nainital - on a very very tight budget and for only 1 night stay. 

I walked EVERYWHERE, did not want to spend money on a rental scooty - don't have a license. Tried to experience the place not a tourist but how a local lives. 
My trip began from Delhi - 360 rupees bus to kashipur (I have a relative here I spent the night at relatives house.) 
Next morning at 7:30 
Kashipur to Haldwani/kathgodam - 125 bus fare 
Haldwani to nainital - 85 bus fare 
~12.00
I deboarded at bus depot on opposite side of the Naina Devi temple. 
Walked through mall road beside the lake taking in the views, visited Naina Devi mandir, walked through and looked at food and clothes at the tibetian and bhutani markets. Reached my hostel at around 1pm 
Stay - gostops nainital ~ 650 for a dorm bunk bed. 
Left for Tiffin top trek at around 1.30 - found it closed due to rockslide. 
Proceeded to walk around the city had lunch visited the touristy places. - lovers point, suicide point, lands end (here people were travelling to lands end on horseback instead of hiking- I decided to hike and got free guide experience whilst walking beside the horses and their handlers), the cave gardens etc. 
~7:00 pm 
Came back to hostel spent some time in the common areas had overpriced coffee (rewarded myself) then again went downhill to have dinner in mall road. Got a lift back-uphill to hostel with ""hostel Wale bhaiya"" 
Spent some more time in the common areas. 
Slept around 12 
Next morning 5:30 woke up bathed and got ready and checked out. The ""hostel Wale bhaiya"" took me with his scooty to ""Naina Devi"" trek start point. I reached at around 7 when the sun had only lit up the tip of the mountains. 
This jungle hike/trek was one of the most visually stunning experiences in my life. I was completely and absolutely alone and just had myself, one bar of dairy milk, and the jungle. Around 1/2 hour into the trek I started to see the Himalayas- snow covered peaks lit by the first light of the rising sun. The jungle was alive with so much wildlife - deers, wild dogs, pea fowls, lots of bees and hornets, and so many types of birds I don't know names of. Everything was just so peaceful and serene. Reached the peak at around 9:15. The guy who runs a small shop on the peak informed me that I was the first to climb that day.
Came down and had lunch around 11.30-12 proceeded to roam around the city again this time visiting governor's house , high court etc. before boarding a direct private bus back to kashipur - 260 rupees. And then back to Delhi next morning on train 2S class - 100 rupees. 

Total spending - 2640 inclusive of everything.

I wanted to end this by asking people on this subreddit to share places to visit in similar 5000 range for the beginning as this was my first time experience and I want to experience more similar ways and also maybe meet new people who share a passion for travel and see life from a different view.

Menapause has been various shades of hell and my coping mechanisms of choice is to just not do a day... I have others but this is the one I love to indulged in when I have the opportunity.

I have been having a rough few weeks so yesterday I had the opportunity to just cancel my day and stay in bed (strictly speaking half day). I don't start work till 2pm and it's like a 10 min walk from my house so I got up at 12.30pm. My youngest son brought me coffee in bed and my daughter brought me some lunch as I said I was refusing to engage with that particular Monday morning. I watched crap on TV and did some knitting. Totally ignored all the usual chores...

A work colleague asked me how my weekend was and I said it had been hectic and I was getting burned out (she knows I'm having issues, she got pissed when I got given a personal fan at work). And then asked me what I did that morning so I said the above...

Apparently that's not appropriate behaviour and I really should not be wallowing in self pity. There was other words but those are the ones my brain latched onto...she was outraged that I said yehhhh no! My choice of self care is none of her business... and I may do it 2 days in a row....

Bonus she refused to talk to me the rest of the day...sheer bliss.

How do I deal with this?,"I‚Äôve been together with my girlfriend now for 8 months. We met working together at a coffee shop where I was covering weekend shifts for about a month or so. She works part-time as she‚Äôs also a student and I had been looking for more work at the time and ended up moving to a different location. We hit it off after the first few times working together and started going out towards the end of the time I was working there.

Since then our relationship has been really good. We‚Äôve both improved each other‚Äôs lives by caring for one another, we never lack things to talk about and we just get along very well. All in all I am happy with the relationship I‚Äôm in and want it to continue, but as the title suggests I‚Äôm dealing with some negative feelings right now.

The other day she called me in tears telling me how she had something to tell me and said that before the two of us had met she had slept with her manager, a guy we both know from having worked there. She told me that she felt I should know because she didn‚Äôt want there to be secrets between us and that she felt guilty not informing me earlier before we got more serious.

It didn‚Äôt really affect me that much at the time when she told me. I think she felt pretty bad about the whole thing having happened in the first place since she had shown animosity towards her manager to me in the past, but I wasn‚Äôt feeling weird or put off by it in the moment, just kinda surprised. She came over later that night an absolute mess and we had a good time together before going to sleep.

Now that it‚Äôs been a few days though, I can definitely tell this is bothering me and I‚Äôm getting uncomfortable about her working together with someone she slept with who is also her boss. She only works two shifts a week, but one of those is with him one on one and I‚Äôm having a hard time not thinking about that without getting angry or upset. 

She had told me when she first said what happened that she thought about quitting after they had slept together and that she was willing to quit now if it was bothering me, but I didn‚Äôt really mind that much at the time. 

Since then I‚Äôve expressed to her that it is bothering me and she told me that she would ask to have her schedule switched around so they wouldn‚Äôt be working together, but now I wonder how much I‚Äôm letting my uncomfortable feelings and uproot her life because of something that happened before we even met.

I don‚Äôt really know what to do right now with my feelings. I‚Äôm confused as to whether or not I want to ask her to find a new job or if I want to just accept things and move on from them. 

Hopefully someone out there reads this and can give me some advice to work things out either in my head or with my girlfriend. I guess the question I have is what would you do in this situation that would be ideal for both me and my girlfriend given the circumstances?

We've received lots of feedback since launch and we've been busy making more content, quality of life improvements and bug fixes to the game.

[Check the trailer here.](https://youtu.be/wTniRDXrqU4?si=LLqmvbDVef0NhgSZ) Hope you enjoy it!

Here's few highlights from the update:

* Fertilizers allow you to bring back fertility to your farm plots, as long as your compost production keeps up with your requirements.
* Farming on clay. Use metal tools to establish farm plots on the more fertile clay soil.
* Advanced Stock Manager controls allows you to keep item reserves, enable/disable each recipe and automate them if all the materials are available.
* Windmill building. Grind seeds into flour much more efficiently than with hand mills.
* New spells. Harness the spirits to work in your camp, level uneven ground with a little riff from the shaman's kantele and alter the wind to control how the fire spreads and boost the windmill efficiency.
* Firefighter/military draft control. You can now decide how many goblins should participate in automatic firefighting/combat duties.
* New sacrifice mechanics makes making sacrifices smoother and easier to control so you won't accidentally miss them and anger the Keepers anymore.

1gk2lt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1gk2lt5/best_comfortable_sleeper_sofa/,[BEST] Comfortable Sleeper Sofa,"So, let me start by saying that my living situation is like a game of musical chairs, only less fun and with more cat hair. I recently upgraded my cramped apartment with the [3 in 1 Loveseat Sofa Bed, Pull Out Couch Sleeper with Storage](https://amzn.to/3UCk5yH), and I honestly think it might just be the best decision I‚Äôve made since adopting my ridiculously fluffy cat, Mr. Whiskers.

First off, let‚Äôs talk comfort. This *comfortable sleeper sofa* is exactly that‚Äîcomfortable! I was a bit skeptical when I first heard ‚Äúsleeper sofa,‚Äù because, let‚Äôs be honest, I‚Äôve had some pretty traumatic experiences with those in the past (remember that one time I woke up with my back feeling like it had been run over by a bus?). But this one? Game changer.

I can easily spend a lazy Sunday afternoon binge-watching my favorite shows while sinking into this couch. It feels like being wrapped in a giant marshmallow‚Äîif marshmallows had excellent lumbar support and didn‚Äôt melt when you spilled coffee on them. And when my friends come over (because I‚Äôm a social butterfly, obviously), the pull-out feature works like a charm. Just a simple pull, and boom! I‚Äôve transformed my living room into a cozy sleep zone.

**BTW I GOT MINE FOR CHEAP** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3UCk5yH)

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the storage aspect. Living in a small space means I‚Äôm always looking for ways to maximize what little square footage I have. The under-seat storage in this *comfortable sleeper sofa* is a lifesaver. I can stuff away all of Mr. Whiskers‚Äô toys, my blanket fort supplies (hey, don‚Äôt judge), and even a few extra snacks for those late-night Netflix binges. Who knew a sofa could double as a secret stash spot? It‚Äôs like my sofa is a superhero in disguise.

Now, a funny little story: the other night, I had a friend crash at my place after an impromptu karaoke session (I may or may not have sung ‚ÄúLivin‚Äô on a Prayer‚Äù too passionately). They were sprawled out on the sleeper part, completely knocked out, while I was having a little midnight snack. In a moment of sheer brilliance, I decided to join them on the sleeper section, but let‚Äôs just say my attempt to quietly slide in without waking them was about as successful as my karaoke skills. Spoiler: I knocked over the snack bowl, and we both woke up to a symphony of potato chip crunching.

Overall, the *3 in 1 Loveseat Sofa Bed,* [Pull Out Couch Sleeper](https://amzn.to/3UCk5yH) *with Storage* has become my go-to furniture piece. It‚Äôs stylish, functional, and, most importantly, incredibly comfortable. Whether I‚Äôm lounging, hosting, or sleeping, it‚Äôs got me covered. If you‚Äôre in the market for a *comfortable sleeper sofa*, this one gets a solid five out of five stars from me‚Äîand Mr. Whiskers, who, let‚Äôs be honest, now believes he owns the couch.",1,1730797621.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False
1gk2lqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1gk2lqh/best_cordless_drill_motor_starting_ratchet/,Best Cordless Drill Motor Starting Ratchet,"Hey fellow DIY enthusiasts! I just wanted to share my thoughts on the [DEWALT 20V Max Cordless Drill Motor Starting Ratchet](https://amzn.to/3UCt42E). After putting this bad boy to the test, I can confidently say it has become my new best friend in the garage. Yes, it‚Äôs official: I‚Äôm in a committed relationship with a power tool.

Let me set the scene. The other weekend, I decided to tackle a little home improvement project‚Äîputting together a new bookshelf that was a *little* too ambitious for my skill level. The instructions were in English, but they might as well have been in hieroglyphics. I had wood, screws, and a growing sense of dread as I tried to make sense of the chaos.

Enter the DEWALT 20V Max Cordless Drill. With its powerful motor and sleek design, it looked like something Batman would use if he ever decided to tackle IKEA furniture. I plugged in the battery, which, by the way, holds a charge like my coffee holds caffeine‚Äîforever. Seriously, I‚Äôve been using it for weeks, and it‚Äôs still going strong.

Now, onto the real magic: the **motor starting ratchet** feature. This little gem is a game-changer. Picture this: I was trying to screw in the last shelf support, and of course, the screw decided it was going to play hard to get. Instead of wrestling with it like a greased pig (which I may have done in the past), I switched to the motor starting ratchet mode. It gave me that extra oomph I needed to get the job done. The screw went in with a satisfying *click*, and I felt like a DIY superhero.

**BTW I GOT MINE FOR CHEAP** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3UCt42E)

And let‚Äôs talk about weight. This cordless drill is light enough to wield with one hand while holding a cup of coffee in the other (not that I recommend power tool multitasking, but I‚Äôm just saying). I was able to move around my cluttered garage without feeling like I was carrying a small child. Plus, it has this ergonomic grip that makes it feel like it was molded just for me. No more hand cramps after 20 minutes of drilling!

Now, I know you‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWhat about the price?‚Äù Look, you‚Äôre investing in a tool that‚Äôs going to last. This isn‚Äôt some flimsy drill that will give up on you halfway through a project. The DEWALT 20V Max is durable and ready to tackle everything from light household tasks to serious renovations.

So, if you're in the market for a [cordless drill motor starting ratchet](https://amzn.to/3UCt42E), do yourself a favor and grab the DEWALT 20V Max. It‚Äôll make you feel like a pro‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre really just trying to put together a bookshelf that was supposed to be ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù Plus, your friends will be super impressed when they see you wielding it like a pro.

So, this girl and I had known each other for a while. We went to high school together and then the same university. We had a lot of the same friends and were always around each other when our friend groups got together. My sophomore year and her freshman year we found each other in the same class. She was always very attractive and kinda flirted with me when our friends weren‚Äôt around. 

One day we planned on studying for an exam together after our classes were over for the day. She was already waiting for me in the library when she texted me ‚Äúwhere are you? I‚Äôm here?‚Äù. I told her ‚ÄúOTW! Be there soon!‚Äù As I got close to the library, I saw a big line at the Starbucks and thought hmmmmm I‚Äôve always wanted to cum into a HOT chicks coffee‚Ä¶ I said fuck it. Got in line and texted her telling her I was grabbing coffee and asked if she wanted one. She said yes of course. Told her I‚Äôd get her the same one I usually get. üòú

The line took a while, but I finally got them and booked it straight to the bathroom. Thinking about it hard me so ready already. While I was jerking my cock over her hot coffee she texted me asking, ‚ÄúWhere are you?? You stilling coming?‚Äù Haha I finished into her drinking before replying ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù. I was surprised honestly how much cum the first couple ropes dropped into the small coffee cup. Too late though. I mixed it up best I could with the whipped cream and put the cap on it. 

I made my way upstairs making sure not to mix the cups up and found her waiting for me. She said ‚ÄúYou took forever!‚Äù. I told her the line was so long and blamed the barista. Set her coffee down between us and started getting my study materials out. I saw her immediately go for a big sip from her fresh cum coffee. She instantly looked at it like it just slapped her across the face‚Ä¶..

She froze and looked at me and said ‚ÄúWHAT did you put in this?‚Äù ..fuck‚Ä¶ quickly I said what??? She said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like, salty..‚Äù I played it off perfect and said ‚ÄúYeah they said it‚Äôs a salted caramel something‚Ä¶‚Äù  

She gave me a look so intense and then just said ‚ÄúOh, okay‚Äù. She had tasted cum many times and I know she was super familiar with coffees too. But I think she knew and just liked it, so she just pretended that she didn‚Äôt know the difference. HOWEVER, at the time, I did not know that cum in hot drinks like coffee floats and curdles instantly to be clumpy and textured‚Ä¶. Haha. So she got a huge sip of hot incubated semen for her first sip instead of coffee or the whipped cream that floats up and away! 

Wonderfully, she just pretended not to notice after a few minutes and we studied together for a while as she sipped and savored the semen treat I made her. She made a few pretty loud slurping sounds a couple times so I knew she was sucking it down. 

That‚Äôs pretty much it. She never brought it up again but I know to this day she always knew I jerked off into her hot coffee moments before she tasted my special creamer!

","# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don‚Äôt get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It‚Äôs a gentle reminder that you don‚Äôt need that mid-afternoon snack.",1,1730797167.0,u_Short_Argument4900,0,1.0,False

I'm currently on month 2 of 10mg Ritalin intake since my official paper diagnosis. For the first month, I had a bad tendency to palpitate as like a pre-symptom before my mind clears and I get stimulated. I really did try to weather it out, until it ended up with me being so overstimulated bc of the unfamiliarity of the stimulant's effect on me.

So I consulted with my psych, and he said we can half the dosage for now. So I did so, and the effects above are gone. BUT, now I seem to have the same effect as I do with ANY normal stimulants like coffee or energy drinks; lethargy! I crashed out mid-work yesterday and it was bad.

I just wanna ask if any of yall went through the same thing? Bc now I feel so confused to pick what to do; deal with a full dosage that does wake me but overstims me, or a half dosage that makes me want to fall asleep. (Also, the half-dosage is like a survival tactic I'm doing with the downward spiral state my country's economy is falling to; it's very hard to get 1.) the prescription itself, and 2.) the meds itself due to lack of stock, not available in all regions of our country, and bc of how expensive it is.

1gk2eat,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gk2eat/is_there_a_life_worth_living_for_me/,Is there a life worth living for me?,"I hope the title doesn't come across as the passive-aggressive existential musings of someone with passive or even active suicidal ideation. I do have persistent depressive disorder but, as per its definition, it's not as severe as major clinical depression, though it's still quite debilitating. I do not know if it is the primary source of my being so hopeless most of the time. But still, I am not suicidal. I'm just emotionally dead. I am seeking treatment through natural supplements at the moment but they take time to be effective, and I doubt they will completely eliminate all the symptoms of depression I have. As I understand, some don't relate to my neurochemistry.

I am about to turn 33 of age and I am upset at the life I am living. It is very unideal, passive, uneventful and completely absent of meaning and purpose. I am also deeply distressed about how difficult and troubling my life has been so far. I have very few happy memories, and even fewer genuinely joyful ones (distinction being that of degree). I ruminate a lot and have a lot of shame surrounding how toxic I had become, having developed subclinical borderline personality organization, though to that end, the only thing that lingers on is my insecurity, and I am deeply insecure.

I cannot for the life of me decide what I want to do for my career. And I do not know how to go about work that has a good ratio of supply to demand, pays well, and allows for a healthy work-life balance. And I have extreme doubt in my capabilities and potential as a person. I also feel like a complete failure in life, because for the most part I am. I have a lot of issues, though the rate at which I am trying to deal with them is painstakingly slow. I am too extremely ashamed and embarrassed to list them. I do know what they are, at least. And I am not in denial about any. I just don't ever feel the motivation to formulate a solution to them through an informal framework that will allow me to deal with each.

I really do want to get my act together and have quite a good idea of how I would like to go about living my life, even if it doesn't mean living to the fullest. But that's still a good thing because, as mentioned before, one ought to maintain an attitude of being realistic. I just have a hard time visualizing success and getting excited about everything I can do with my life. I dream of living life to the fullest but don't know how to buffer my dreams with a wedge of realism separating it from idealism, in addition to not having much hope for my future. I would love to see the rest of South Africa. Even better would be to travel the world, but I don't find it realistic. Still, I want to live. There are so many things I want to do; so many places I'd love to see; things to experience; people to meet; adventures to be had; things to learn.

I am trying to be more outgoing but don't have anywhere to go other than hiking, cycling a little, exercising three times a week, going to the movies once a month, perhaps a coffee shop or something similar. I buy a book every month, though I never read them due to disinterest. I in fact have a very long list of things I'd like to do on a semi-annual basis that I call my Chronological Activities List. It forms a part of my Fulfilment Structures, which is a component of something I have in the works that I call my Idiosyncratic Fulfilment Framework. It's not particularly robust or coherent but it's better than nothing, at least. It's still very unorganized but I have the main ideas down. It's a formalized set of components and structures that, if I were to glue them together in some way, they would help me make the best of my limited time, which I see as a very valuable resource. It's still very incoherent, or something like that, very disorganized and quite incomplete for me to want to explain its structure and the ideas I have going within it here but I can if anyone really insists on it.

# Mount Kilimanjaro

Mount Kilimanjaro is located three degrees south of the equator in Northeastern Tanzania. It is the tallest mountain in Africa and is the highest free-standing mountain in the world. This immense mountain is made up of three volcanoes: Shira, Mawenzi, and our goal, Kibo, the tallest one in the middle.  
Of the famous highest seven peaks in the world, this is the easiest to get to and the easiest to climb. It requires no technical climbing experience, and any moderately fit person can summit the mountain. Though Mount Kilimanjaro is frequented by an estimated 50,000 hikers a year, the trek is not to be taken lightly. Sufficient physical conditioning and a lot of preparations must be made in order to ensure a safe, enjoyable experience.  
[Kilimanjaro Climbing Routes](https://twendeafricatours.com/mount-kilimanjaro-climbing)**:**¬†All the Kilimanjaro routes we offer are very scenic and offer an exhilarating experience. The success rate for reaching the peak is greatly determined by your ability to acclimate to the high altitude. Spending more days ascending the mountain will give your body more time to adequately adjust to the altitude and low oxygen environment.  
**Trekking:**¬†Daily travel time varies depending on the route and day. On average you should expect to be hiking for 4-6 hours per day with the exception of ‚Äúsummit day‚Äù, which is an arduous 11-16 hour trek. Our guides will purposely set a slow walking pace to ensure group cohesion (‚Äúpole, pole‚Äù, or ‚Äúslowly, slowly‚Äù) in order to give each climber adequate time to acclimatize and adapt to the thinning air. Expect a lot of uphill and downhill walking, which is why you should make sure you‚Äôre sufficiently conditioned before your trip.  
Each route we use on our Kilimanjaro trek is well defined and screened for safety, but after heavy rains the lower slopes and areas near the summit can become muddy. The guides will help you along the path and ensure you‚Äôre safe when you encounter difficult areas.  
During the day you‚Äôll carry a medium sized backpack carrying the essential items you‚Äôll need for that day of climbing until you reach that night‚Äôs campsite. You should only carry essential supplies such as extra layers of clothing, water, snacks, sunscreen, insect repellent, etc.  
**Climate:**¬†Because bad weather affects your chances of reaching Kilimanjaro‚Äôs peak, choosing the right time of year is imperative to your summiting success.  
Kilimanjaro‚Äôs climate varies greatly depending on the time of year. It‚Äôs best to plan your climb during the driest months of the year ‚Äì Jan, Feb and Aug, Sep. But you‚Äôll experience reasonable weather any time between January-mid March and June-October. We don‚Äôt recommend trekking during the long rainy season between the end of March and the beginning of June or the shorter rainy season from November to the beginning of December.  
You should prepare to pass through a variety of weather conditions ‚Äì from forest terrains and desert valleys to snowcapped mountain trails and freezing temperatures near the peak. You can find information on what to pack for your Kilimanjaro trek on faqs page.  
**Best time to climb Mount Kilimanjaro:**¬†When to climb Mount Kilimanjaro safe, how to climb mount Kilimanjaro climbing route, When to climb Mount Kilimanjaro? or How to climb mount Kilimanjaro?  
The fact is most of the month have few rainy days makes it possible for climb in relatively good condition all year round.  
During the rain period of March and May, cloud tends to pile up and over the summit, dropping snow on top and at base. Visibility can be limited by cloud cover even when no rainfall. The temperature at this time of the year is relative warm.  
The dry season beginning in the rate June and through July can be very cold at night but usually is clear of cloud.  
August and September are also cool and can have completely clear days, but usually a dripping cloud belt girdles the mountain above the forest moorland. The summit can be totally clear.  
The shorter rainy period of October to December often has thunderstorms that pass over the mountain, dropping rains as they go. Typical the cloud disappear in the evening leaving the nights and morning very clear with excellent visibility.  
January and February are usually dry, warm and clear with brief rain showers which make good climbing condition.  
Even thought one can climb thought out the year, January, February and September are the best month with July, August, November and December are also good.

# Serengeti National Park

The Serengeti is vast and beautiful; it's one of Africa's most captivating safari areas. The sheer amount of game here is amazing: estimates suggest up to about two million wildebeest, plus perhaps half a million zebra, hundreds of thousands of Thompson's gazelle, and tens of thousands of impala, Grant's gazelle, topi (tsessebe), hartebeest, eland and other antelope - all hunted by the predators for which these plains are famous.  
Some of this game resides permanently in 'home' areas, which are great for safaris all year round. But many of the wildebeest and zebra take part in the¬†[migration](https://twendeafricatours.com/6days-great-wildebeest-migration)¬†\- an amazing spectacle that's one of the greatest wildlife shows on earth. If you plan carefully, it's still possible to witness this in wild and remote areas.  
The Greater Serengeti ecosystem  
The Serengeti National Park itself covers about 15,000km2¬†of mostly flat or gently rolling grasslands, interspersed with the occasional rock outcrops, or kopjes. But this is just the centre of a whole ecosystem which covers more than double that area, and includes Grumeti Reserve, Ikorongo Game Reserve, Loliondo Controlled Area, Maswa Game Reserve, part of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and also Kenya's relatively small Maasai Mara Game Reserve. This combined area is often referred to as the Greater Serengeti area, or the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem.  
Southern plains  
Vast short-grass plains cover the south of Serengeti National Park, stretching into the north of Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the south-west Loliondo and Maswa Game Reserve. Occasionally there are small kopjes which, like the forests around Lake Ndutu, harbour good populations of resident game. However, around these oases of permanent wildlife, the majority of this area is flat and open. It's alive with grazing wildebeest from around late-November to April, but can be very empty for the rest of the year. Places to stay here include  
The Seronera area  
In the heart of the national park, just to the north of the short-grass plains, Seronera has all the best features of the Serengeti and also, sadly, its worst. Scenically, it's a lovely area - with open plains, occasional kopjes and lines of hills to add interest. The resident game here is phenomenal, with high densities of relaxed leopards, cheetah and lion. These live off the resident herbivores, as well as the migrating game. The migration passes through here in April/May, but Seronera is within reach of both the Southern Plains and the Western Corridor - so from about November to June, it can be used as a base to see the migration. Seronera's big drawback is that it is always busy; places to stay include:  
Western Corridor  
Stretching to the west, almost to Lake Victoria, the Serengeti narrows into what's known as the Western Corridor. The key feature of this area is the two rivers, the Grumeti and the Mbalageti, which run almost parallel, each supporting a band of most, evergreen riparian forest. This area sustains a very good permanent game population, including plenty of zebra and wildebeest, all the predators and forest 'specialists' like colobus monkeys. The birdife is particularly varied. The migration passes through between about May and July - pausing to gather momentum before crossing the crocodile-rich waters of the Grumeti River, into the Grumeti Reserve. Camps in the Serengeti's Western Corridor include:  
Northern Serengeti  
Stretching from Seronera for about 100km north, to the Kenyan border, the northern Serengeti is gently rolling country, broken by small rivers and occasional hills and kopjes. There are good permanent populations of wildlife in several areas here, including the very beautiful Lobo Kopje. It's interesting, varied country that's far from the park's main entry point in the south - and hence it receives delightfully few visitors. The further you go north, the fewer vehicles you see. Even when the migration is here, between about August and October, you can still enjoy spectacular crossings of the Mara River. A particularly stunning are is the wild Lamai Wedge - the area of land between the Mara River and the Kenya Border - which includes the picturesque Wogakuria Kopjie, and a beautiful series of game-rich valleys and plains. This is the only area of the national park where off-road driving is acceptable. Here, we suggest you stay at:  
Grumeti Reserves  
Singita Grumeti Reserves covers almost 1,500km¬†2¬†of private reserves which run along the north side of the Western Corridor. Within this are three, very different luxury lodges. All offer unrivalled exclusivity for watching the migration as it journeys north, and recycle all of their profits into local conservation and community development initiatives.  
Loliondo Reserve  
West of the Serengeti National Park, between the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Kenyan border, lies Loliondo game Controlled Area - an area belonging to the Maasai tribes that live there. The western side of this, beside the park, is very much part of the Serengeti's ecosystem; it has much resident game and the migration passes through here as well.  
There are a few camps here which have the flexibility to offer night drives and walks, often using Maasai guides - and visits to local Maasai villages. Around about October and November, there's a good chance to see part of the migration here, as it returns south.  
Trips to the Serengeti  
Sadly, the Serengeti doesn't always live up to its potential. It's easy to end up with a herd of vehicles around you, destroying any sense of wilderness. It's tempting to opt to rush around on dusty, corrugated roads with little time to stop. It's also easy to simply miss the migration, which isn't nearly as predictable these days as many will tell you.  
Because of this, planning a safari here can be complicated; we need to guide you to choose the right camps at the right time of year, and get the best experience possible - especially when the wildebeest migration does vary every year.

# Zanzibar Beach Holidays

The name Zanzibar is an Arabic word that is translated as ‚Äòthe coast of black people‚Äô. The Zanzibar archipelago is a series of islands on the Indian Ocean about 16-31 miles from the mainland Republic of Tanzania. It is a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. The island has the best beaches in the world ‚Äì and this is not an exaggeration. If you love lazing around in the sun, then this is the place to go. Below are a few facts that will give you an overview of the Island country.

# Ngorongoro Conservation Area

In 1951, the enormous Serengeti National Park was declared, encompassing the present Serengeti, plus the Ngorongoro area and surrounding Crater Highlands. Today, this is split into the present-day Serengeti National Park, and the current Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The conservation area now encompasses a large area of the short-grass plains on the southern side of the Serengeti Plain and also the Ngorongoro Highlands, a range of largely extinct ancient volcanoes on the west side of the Great Rift Valley.  
Ngorongoro Crater Safari  
The showpiece of the conservation area is undoubtedly the Ngorongoro Crater which was created when a large volcano exploded and collapsed on itself two to three million years ago. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and is the largest intact volcanic caldera in the world.  
It measures about 16-19km in diameter, with walls of 400-610m in height. However you measure it, the Crater is a strong candidate for any list of the world's greatest natural wonders. It is renowned both for its geological splendour, and for being a natural reserve which is home to some of the densest large mammal populations found anywhere in Africa.  
Ngorongoro Wildlife Safari  
Due to the enclosed nature of the Crater, it has virtually formed its own ecosystem. Besides the stunning scenery, one of the main attractions of this area is the variety of flora and fauna found in a remarkably compact area all year round. In the Southwest corner there is the Lerai Forest, which is mainly comprised of yellow fever trees (a member of the acacia family). To the north of the forest is a shallow soda lake called Lake Magadi and to the east you will find Gorigor Swamp and the Ngoitokitok Springs where pods of hippo are to be found. The north of the Crater is, on the whole, much drier and consists of the open grasslands which characterise the Crater floor; this is where the majority of the resident game resides. You are guaranteed to see large concentrations of game on any Ngorongoro safari. The mineral-rich floor of this spectacular bowl is largely flat, open and covered in nutritious grasses - much to the liking of large herds of zebra and wildebeest, which graze here. These extensive open plains are also home to herds of buffalo, Thomson's gazelle, Grant's gazelle and tsessebe (often called topi). You'll also find East Africa's best population of black rhinos here, which are often seen in open grasslands. Breeding herds of elephants pass through the Ngorongoro Crater itself only rarely, but you will see a scattering of old bulls, including some of the biggest tuskers left alive in Africa today. The only surprising absentees from the Crater are Impala and Giraffe; it is thought that this is perhaps because of the lack of open woodlands and browsing species of trees which these two tend to thrive on.  
The high numbers of herbivores support the densest populations of predators found anywhere in Africa. The reliable presence of these predators has helped to make a Ngorongoro safari so popular. The Crater's lion population varies significantly over time, the one constant being their complete disregard of vehicles; they will hunt within yards of a vehicle, and when exhausted even seek shade beside them. Spotted hyenas are even more common here, often competing with the lion, and there are a small but growing number of cheetahs. Leopards are around, especially in the vicinity of the Lerai Forest. Side-striped and the lovely golden jackal are often seen skulking around, whilst bat-eared foxes are a rarer sight.  
Having waxed lyrical about the Ngorongoro Crater's wildlife, the reality of safaris there isn't always as amazing. The sheer number of vehicles in the crater, combined with its open environment, can destroy any sense of wilderness. It can feel crowded and busy. Often, this will be mitigated by amazing game sightings, but not always. So whilst Ngorongoro's wildlife is stupendous, the Ngorongoro Crater safari experience isn't always as good as you might imagine.  
Access to Ngorongoro Safari  
The Ngorongoro crater and wider conservation area is easily accessible. There is a daily light aircraft flight to Arusha from Dar (other airstrips in Tanzania also fly to Arusha) where you would then be met by a safari guide in a close-sided pop-top 4 x 4 safari vehicle. Your guide will stay with you for your time down in the Crater, and possibly longer. The drive from Arusha is around 4 hours to begin a Ngorongoro Crater safari.  
Another alternative is to fly to Manyara airstrip, which is about an hour from the Crater. Depending on where you're staying - you may be met by the lodge, or picked up by a private driver guide.  
Alternatively, you could choose to stay on the nearby Rift Valley Escarpment in an area often referred to as Karatu. The lodges and camps here are all less than about 20km from the Crater and have a lot more character than the aforementioned lodges. Gibb's Farm, Plantation Lodge and the Ngorongoro Farmhouse Lodge are all true of this.

# Tarangire National Park

Tarangire National Park covers an undulating area of 2,600km2, between the plains of the Maasai Steppe to the south-east, and the lakes of the Great Rift Valley to the north and west. The northern part of Tarangire is dominated by the perennial Tarangire River, which flows through increasingly incised ravines until it leaves the north-western corner of the park to flow into Lake Burungi. In the south are a series of vast 'swamps' which dry into verdant plains during the dry season.

Although Tarangire is one of only four parks on Tanzania's sometimes frenetic 'northern circuit', it is often either missed out, or given less than 24 hours, by the many relatively cursory mini-bus tours. This means that few get beyond the park's busy northern section, where the majority of camps and lodges is situated.

If you decide to come to Tarangire at all, then we recommend spending a few days in the south of the park, which gets few visitors and retains a real air of wilderness.

Flora & Fauna of Tarangire National Park  
The park's most obvious features are the permanent Tarangire River, which runs the length of it, and the vast 'swamps' - which are, in fact, dry for most of the year. Despite the fact that Tarangire is drier than the Serengeti, its vegetation is generally much more dense including densely packed elephant grass, large areas of mixed acacia woodlands and some lovely ribbons of riverine forest.

# Arusha National Park

Arusha National Park is often overlooked by travelers rushing to the more famous sights of the Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti. However, with a little time, Arusha National Park offers some lovely walking in the foothills of Mount Meru and canoeing on the Momela Lakes, plus gentle game drives. If you have the time it is well worth a day or two.  
There are a range of activities to do in Arusha National Park. This includes walking safaris which are always accompanied by a ranger and last for a maximum of four hours, during which you would stop for a break at one of the park's lovely picnic sites. You can also explore the far reaches of the park by vehicle, taking in some of the lovely views and keeping an eye out for wildlife. Another great activity here and one not found in other safari parks in Tanzania, is a canoeing safari which allows you to explore the Momela Lakes.

# Lake Manyara National Park

Lake Manyara National Park is very easy to access: it's about 90 minutes' drive from Arusha and barely an hour from the Ngorongoro Crater. Because of this, some of the northern side of the park can get very busy, especially in the afternoons. To see the park at its best, we recommend that you either stay within the park or spend two nights somewhere close, entering the park early for a full-day safari.

Safaris to Lake Manyara National Park  
Many people will often visit Lake Manyara National Park enroute to or from the Crater, as part of a short half day safari. Often they won't even spend the night in the area, but will rush on, so as to include as many areas, in as short a space of time as possible.

Though this can save on money, we feel that it restricts time and therefore only allows for visits to the busy northern quarter of the park. This can result in a rushed experience of Lake Manyara that can sometimes result in disappointment.

Instead we would recommend the following two options for visiting Lake Manyara National Park. The first is to stay within the park itself, either in a permanent camp or a more mobile one. This tends to be the more expensive choice, but it is certainly the best way to explore the park. It enables you to be on safari before most others, and explore deeper into the park which day visitors won't have the time to do. Without any doubt, staying inside the park is the best wildlife experience.

Secondly you can opt to stay somewhere outside, but near to the park gate. From here you can enter the park early and enjoy the whole day exploring. There are some economical accommodation options outside the park, some of which are dotted along the top of the Rift Valley Escarpment with great views down across the park

Entrances to the National Park  
There are two main entrances to Lake Manyara National Park, a gate in the north and in the south. Almost everybody uses the northern gate, since the majority of accommodation options are situated here and as a result the northern part of the park is by far the busier one. The gate in the far south is not commonly used and also has restricted access. Only few camps and lodges can use this entrance. Please contact us for more information on camps that can enter via this quiet gate.

# Chemka Hot Springs

The drive to Kikuletwa Hotsprings also known as Rundugai Hot springs or commonly known as Chemka Hot Springs will initially start on a paved road toward Arusha, before turning left onto a gravel road about 30 minutes later. The road will take you thru the gorgeous African countryside pass bush landed, dry riverbeds, baobab and acacia trees among many others.

This vast area, which used to be a hunting ground for Europeans during the 1800s, is home to members of many different tribes, peacefully co-existing as neighbors. Although the game has long since migrated, it is still a haven to many animal species, including a variety of birds.  
When you reach at Kikuletwa village it will appear as an oasis surrounded by sprawling fig trees, in the middle of this semi-arid landscape. You will see crystal clear water bubbling from underground caves, giving the impression that it is boiling, hence the name ""Hot springs"".

The water is perfectly refreshing and if you brought your bathing suit, this is your time to take a dip and relax in the shade of the trees.  
After a picnic lunch, we will start making our way back to Moshi via back gravel roads, taking you past the Kilavu river and sugar cane plantations about 30 minutes prior to arriving back in Moshi late afternoon.

My partner broke up with me last night just because he found out that his Mom has a breast cancer (Stage 3).

Last 2 weeks ago I felt the changes about his behavior minor lang naman pero he do talk casual na like dati malambing siya we donlate night dates, coffee dates, hanggang madaling araw lahat ng iyon ay nawala nung time  na tinopak ako dahil nasa menstrual phase ako, I'm moody na to the point na pinagtatabuyan ko na siya na, na di kami pwede kasi nga ibang religion siya, pero I'm still hoping na siya na maging end game ko, dahil ang rami naming similarities, nasa kanya na lahat ng hinahanap ko, he is consistent, and persistent especially when I in my darkest hour di niya ko iniwan.

First, I still don't know why there are sudden changes happening, I thought it was something else, or merong 3rd party it turns out that he was going through something like that. Breadwinner siya, siya lang inaasahan ng pamilya niya, his 2 siblings may pamilya na, siya nalang wala kaya siya inaasahan mag lakad ng kailangan para sa pamilya. 

Saturday nasa province  ako at kausap ko siya thru vidcall if gusto pa niya magpatuloy  sa aming relasyon, ang sabi kinausap daw siya ng fam kesho ginisa daw siya, pressured na daw siya, gusto niya daw ipagpatuloy samin kasi mahal niya ko at gusto niya bumuo sakin ng pamilya. 

Not until last night napiga ko siya kung bakit bigla siyang nag bago, Nalaman ko lang kagabi, na nadiagnosed yung Mom niya na may Breast Cancer stage 3 nung Sunday pa daw na diagnose na daw yung mom niya dati pero ngayon naging stage 3 na, habang ako na sa province, di niya sinabi sa akin. Pressured na daw siya, he is a dying breed according to him, pero ayaw kong bumitaw I want to become his strength, pero pinagtabuyan nako dahil ayaw na niya daw ako magkaroon ng burden and responsibilities.

""Minahal kita, and I want you to please move on and live on because your life is just starting. There are still a lot of things ahead of you. (5 year gap kami)
Now, as for me, It's time to stop running away and face everything head-on."" Ito ang ilan sa mesnsahe na iniwan niya sakin. Hindi nako nagreply kasi ang sakit na.

Nasaktan ako kasi he fell first and I fell harder, nanahimik ako then you've asked if I wanted to he your partner and then at the end parang tinapon lang ng parang ganun, and it hurts really.

Dunno what to do hindi ako pumasok sa review namin kasi, I feel devastated  right now I really love him even though 3 months lang naging kami , pero sa 3 months na yun it feels 3 years to me, ganun kalalim yung connection naming dalawa. Gusto ko siyang damayan, ayaw kong umalis pero kahit anong gawin ko pinag tatabuyan ako.
 
The problem: pinagtatabuyan nako kahit mahal pa namin ang isat isa
What I've tried so far sabi ko di ko siya iiwan pero pinagtatabuyan nako
Any advice if I give up ko ba para sa ikakabuti niya? Or hold on ako kasi mahal namin ang isa't isa. At sabay namin haharapin ang problema kahit pinagtatabuyan nako.

Parang ayaw ko na masilayan yung bukas",10,1730795194.0,adviceph,4,0.92,False

I was already annoyed at this point as I had woken him up early because our 1 year old has a bad infection that and it seems to be getting worse. We are on our way to hospital as we speak. So as soon as I show him this he says. ‚Äúyeah well I have to work today so you need to deal with the two kids‚Äù It irked me that his first thought is himself and what he has to do. He then proceeded to jump in the shower for 25 min, spray his hair with hairspray for 15 min and then turns around to rush me to get dressed because he has to go to work early today. (Understandable as yesterday he left early because we were taken. To emergency in an ambulance but then take a shorter shower or stop staring at yourself in the mirror) this is his normal morning routine, he gets up, makes a coffee for himself, jumps in the shower and leaves, not considering that I want time in the morning to at least shower. 

So anyway later on, my 3 year old was doing something and papa shouted at him, he came crying to me ‚Äúpapa is angry‚Äù and I said to my 3 year old ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, papa is always angry‚Äù and then my husband responded that if I‚Äôm talking about him like that I might as well be his ex. He then continued to say that I‚Äôm useless, everything is always too much for me and that he is capable of cleaning the entire house while looking after the children. Yes, he is, because he largely ignores them when he is around. Whereas my kids are highly dependent and connected to me so they are always interrupting me and I can‚Äôt get things done. 

Anyway. I think I shouldn‚Äôt have said ‚Äúpapa is always angry‚Äù but I‚Äôm just fed up of my husbands aggressive reactions to EVERYTHING. So AIO?",0,1730795121.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

me and my boyfriend would like to travel to the Philippines in Jan to enjoy food, people and landscape. Definitely would want to include Palawan (also El Nido...), Coron and Cebu. Read a few travel blogs and everyone really warns intensively about sickness from water. Hope I wont insult anyone with my post - I don't want to sound like I'm assuming Ph is polluted and dirty just everywhere....

I just want to be realistic. And: The amount of posts about it is really staggering, hence we are wondering: Is it possible to not get sick at all? I mean, bottled water is for sure. Brushing teeth, closing mouth under shower etc - all a certainty. Yes, no ice in drinks, no salad or sliced fruits.

But what about food, even if cooked? Or coffee in restaurants? We've read that on boat tours they tell you to leave your bottled water at home to avoid pollution due to trourists throwing away the bottles...

Maybe we are a bit too paranoid. But this topic is raised and mentioned so incredibly often. No comparisson to for example Thailand were we travelled last year (and luckily didnt have any probs).

#Deep beneath Rathara, in the Depths of the Ruinways, where time had withered the ancient stone...the Temple of the Weaver stirred from its centuries-long slumber. 

The hallways rumbled, crystals long dormant blazing suddenly to life. Their light casting shadows across walls etched with cosmic mathematics - the language of reality. 

The central chamber held an obsidian altar, its surface a web of silver calculations. Eight corridors stretched out like a spider's legs, each one a different thread in destiny's design. 

Dust-covered mirrors lined these halls, their surfaces rippling with lost secrets and distant dimensions. Time had worn away at the temple's power. Defense systems slumbered in the walls, engines ran wild with ancient calculations that served no purpose. 

The sacred pools that once showed glimpses through the cosmic web had long since dried to crystal.

But after centuries of silence, something had changed in the cosmic equation. The temple's soul awakened, recognizing a familiar resonance in its halls.

**Another weaver was coming home.**

The first manifestation appeared as a shimmer in the air, like heat waves rising from sun-baked stone. The shimmer coalesced into threads of pure blue energy that began to weave through the air with purpose, forming complex patterns that echoed the temple's own geometric designs.

Along the chamber walls, the arrays of ancient mirrors‚Äîtheir surfaces clouded with age‚Äîbegan to respond. Light moved across their surfaces like shimmering sunlight over the water. 

In their depths, fragments of other realities became briefly visible: a cosmic web stretched between countless stars; the Web of Life and Destiny. 

The energy threads multiplied, their dance becoming more complex as they began to spiral inward toward the altar. They formed a cocoon of pure energy, a body of power that contained within it the pattern of a soul. Within this luminous shell, something began to take shape‚Äîfirst the suggestion of a form, then more definite structures: bones of light, muscles of sinew, skin woven from the atoms in reality itself.

Lightning crackled through his reforming consciousness. The sum of his existence wove itself from fragments of memory: Wednesday group therapy at WISH, where broken wizards found healing through shared trauma and terrible jokes. 

Late nights on Asfelaeia's rooftops with the Revengeancer, debating the ethics of meat manipulation over cheap coffee and expensive guilt.

The threads of who he was crystallized further - that chaotic afternoon when the Shadow Money Wizard Gang tried robbing First Bank of the Damned. 

He'd webbed up three dark economists before their CFO of Crime blasted him through a window. 

Hours later, soaked to the bone from a Cabal hydrokinetic's surprise attack, he'd laughed it off while wringing out his hat.

Reality pulsed and shifted. The Spider. The Sorcerer. The Wizard. Each aspect of his being clicked into place like tumblers in a cosmic lock. Not just the grand battles and cosmic judgments - but the small moments that made him who he was.

The Wizard Spider-Man's first sensation was one of overwhelming input‚Äîevery nerve ending singing with the raw feeling of being suddenly, completely alive again. The cool stone beneath him, the weight of gravity, the press of air against his skin through the fabric of his costume‚Äîeach sensation was simultaneously familiar and startlingly new, like remembering how to walk after a long illness.

He lay still for several moments, allowing his reformed body to adjust. The transition from cosmic essence back to physical form was jarring, like trying to pour an ocean back into a cup. 

Spidey's Spidey-Sense responded in kind with a thunderclap headache. He wasn't in danger no, but perhaps it was an aftershock from dying and being remade again. 

His consciousness, which had briefly touched the infinite during this discorporation, now had to remember its boundaries in space. For brief lingering moments, he could see this place in ancient glory, and himself wandering off the altar. 

Approaching one of the less clouded mirrors, he caught his first glimpse of this reformed self of his. 

The familiar red and blue of his Spider-Man suit remained, but his mystical garments had transformed completely. 

Gone was the rich purple of his previous robes, replaced by flowing vestments of deep blue that seemed to catch and hold the shadows within their folds. Golden geometric sigils traced paths across the fabric like circuits of power, each rune shifting subtly as ambient energy flowed through them. 

He felt... different this time around. The sensation wasn't just physical - though being reconstituted from pure cosmic energy would make anyone feel strange. No, this was deeper. His very essence had changed.

""Big change..."" he mused, remembering his first look being *Spider-Man* all those years ago.

He adjusts the cloak's drape across his shoulders, the deep blue fabric flowing around him. Golden threads caught what little light existed, tracing arcane patterns across its surface.

""I guess blue's the new black. Not bad, actually.""

Spidey looks around at his surroundings. Ancient columns line a vast chamber, their surfaces etched with formulas masquerading as decorative symbols. The sickly green light filtering through cobwebs casts uncertain shadows across scattered stone tables, their surfaces cluttered with dusty artifacts and ritual implements. Tattered tapestries hang between the columns, their faded imagery depicting spiders and robed figures frozen in eternal ceremony.

""Where am I?""

Something skitters in the darkness at his voice, a whisper of movement that fades as quickly as it came. As he explored deeper into the temple, each chamber revealed new mysteries.

The temple's great hall stretched before him, a colonnade of towering pillars carved with the forms of silk-priests and their sacred symbols. The vaulted ceiling bore circular patterns that caught the dim light, while the stone floor descended in broad steps, worn and cracked from centuries of slumber. 

Though portions had crumbled, the hall's craftsmanship spoke of master builders who understood both beauty and purpose - each element placed with deliberate care by those ancient practitioners who once wove reality's threads between these very walls.

In what appeared to be an ancient study, he found artifacts that began to hint at his location in space time. Star charts showed familiar constellations, while scrolls depicted species of spiders he'd never encountered‚Äîsome with impossible numbers of legs, others that seemed to exist with magical effects.

One scroll in particular caught his attention. It showed a figure much like himself‚Äîa being marked by both spider and mystic symbols‚Äîstanding before what appeared to be a great web containing multiple worlds. 

The script beneath was in an ancient language, but certain symbols resonated with Spidey's own mystical knowledge: ""Chosen,"" ""Convergence,"" and ""Renewal.""

The walls here told stories in carved reliefs: the creation of the Great Web by Neith, the establishment of the cosmic order, the training of the first spider-priests who learned to walk between worlds. 

One panel showed the temple itself, depicted as a nexus point where multiple strands of the Great Web intersected.

""What is this Spider-Worshiping Temple? This is all... really uncanny.""
