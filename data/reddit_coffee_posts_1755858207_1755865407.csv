But it always left me drained.

Recently I tried something different: instead of adding pressure, I removed friction.
	•	I set up a simple “writing ritual”: same playlist, same chair, same time of day.
	•	I gave myself permission to write badly on the first draft.
	•	I stopped measuring progress by word count, and instead by time spent engaged.

The crazy part? My output actually improved. The words come faster, and editing feels less like punishment.

Date: 8th August, ####


I died a hundred times.

The first was when I called her eyes green—a shade of green perhaps?

She smiled. 

Fog pressed against the window.

Another time, I followed the sound 
from beneath the floorboards—
a recorder whispering my name in reverse.

Once, I forgot her name.
She kissed me like a black hole kisses light.

Her lips, cherry-stained and soft.

Low hiss of coal crept across the glass.

She left the door open once—perhaps by mistake? Through the flickering dance of light and shadows...

I saw her change.

A black dress gently slipping down her porcelain skin.

A trick of the light—I had thought. It wasn’t.

One time, between the hush of breaths,
I asked about the mark, inked 
between the shadowed hollow of her chest.

Her body tensed up—just for a moment.
And her lips met mine.

A little dot below her lip—a beauty mark?

There were ninety-two times more...

And every time, I wake up, 
right back at the start of it all—that weird dating app.

The coffee date—scent of roasted beans.

A lace choker wrapped around her neck.

Her humming my favourite song—
A sweet coincidence, I'm still not used to.

And a pair of hazel eyes, a little too still.

I have died a hundred times.
And perhaps, I'm willing to die a hundred more...

Somewhere, at the dimly lit corner of the bar, sat a man hunched over an old pocket diary on the table. 

His pen scratching furiously between swallows of cheap whisky.

The bar was unusually loud tonight—smoke curling toward the ceiling, laughter swelling and breaking like waves against unseen shores.

However to him, bar’s noise seemed distant, muffled, as though heard from beneath the water.

“But what was it?” he muttered, his voice rough. 

“Her name…her name...her real name…” He paused, staring into the amber swirl in his glass. 

“Rose? No, no, that’s not it.” He shook his head as he furiously chugged few more sips of whisky down his throat. 

“Eve? Evira?” 

His brow furrowed, eyes darting across the page as if the answer might appear there.

“What was it…?” 
He whispered again, slamming the glass down, with a sharp clink.

Sometimes later he pushed away from the table and snapped the old fragile diary shut in his hand. 

Then he rose, unsteadily, swaying and moved pushing through the crowd to the counter. 

No one seemed to notice him though.

He paid the bill and slowly stumbled into the night, heavy with fog, swallowing the streetlights into pale, dying halos. 

His steps wavered, boots dragging along cobblestones slick with damp.

The streets were empty—just wavering shadows and pale halos of light.

Then—from somewhere, within the fog—right beside his ear—something emerged.

A figure formed—took shape—out of thin vapor—soft, indistinct, unmistakably feminine—lips parting just long enough to breathe a single word into the stillness:

“Cthylla…”

Before he could draw a breath, it was gone—dissolved into the fog again.

Then, perhaps in shock—he froze, under a dimly lit street lamp. His breath caught.

The syllables lingered like perfume, curling into his lungs, sinking into his bones.

A tremor passed through him.

“Yes,” he murmured.

Slowly, almost moving as if in a trance, he pulled out his old diary from his over coat, and flipped it to a blank page.

After a minute of what felt like an era, his pen scratched—ink spilling across the paper like veins, branching and curling as though they sought something beyond the margins.

He paused again, staring at what he had written, the lines glistening, almost pulsing in the dim light.

Then, the pen slipped from his grasp, clattering to the cobblestones.

He cried out—no, screamed—almost in awe. “I remember it now… I remember it all now!” 

Laughter spilled from his mouth—wild, untamed almost like a mad-man; his voice echoing through the misty fog—until it swallowed his being whole.

1mx4m1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1mx4m1e/early_spark_concerns/,Early Spark concerns,"**Disclaimer: Not in the US, UK, etc.**

Hi all,

This is my third day with Spark, and I have a  couple of concerns (that I will bring up with my orthodontist on my next visit).

I had traditional braces for 3 years that came off a couple years ago, due to very severe crowding. This had been causing lifelong bleeding and constant infections. Four teeth had to come out. I also have peg 2s that my previous ortho said I could get veneers for, if I was worried about aesthetics. I wasn't and they were prohibitively expensive, so I declined. My treatment required rubber bands to move my jaws as well.

Despite following retainer routine rigorously, my teeth moved almost immediately (which ortho said might happen). I wasn't too bothered, as the movement is kind of minimal. I kept using my retainers every single night instead of going down to twice a week after the first year as instructed though, because I realised even one night without retainers shifted my teeth considerably.

A month ago I noticed gum recession on a fang, so I went to the dentist/orthodontist (different one). They told me it wasn't gum recession, it was my tooth shifting out of its case. They also told me I needed orthodontics work and recommended Spark-they explained the concern wasn't so much my teeth as it was my jaws. They are misaligned, so the only teeth that touch when I close my mouth are my molars.

They said my case is considered a severe, complex one. They estimated 30 months for treatment. I am on a first batch of 17 trays. I have been given the first 3, which I am to change every 10 days. I will also have the veneers, which they said is imperative to avoid teeth moving back into the spaces my peg teeth naturally create. I have been wearing the trays for 22-23h a day, as I eat quickly.

My concerns are as follows:

1. I gag constantly, and it kinda feels like eventually I'm gonna throw up. I have to keep my mouth open all the time to not feel the plastic, or I gag. This only started being a problem around halfway through the second day. I don't know what to do about this, so if anyone has advice I'd appreciate it.
2. After thinking about it and seeing other people's posts here, I am really confused as to why my treatment would take 30 months minimum. My teeth are barely crooked and I have only 2 rubber bands for the jaw thing. When I take the trays out to eat, I can feel my bite has already improved in only 3 days. I have included a picture of my second tray for reference. This is important to me not just because that would mean almost 6 years in total with either braces or aligners in my mouth, but because by the end of this I will have spent almost 10k combined (including the previous braces) and I've had to take out a loan for this. I feel like I got a bit scammed with my braces, and I'm not looking to spend almost 5k on these things only for everything in my mouth to shift AGAIN or to find out it was overkill. I also don't know how realistic it is for me to never go out for food/drinks/coffee for the next 30 months I guess.

Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! 🎉 Have you ever felt that pang of anxiety when it comes time to show your face on camera? The fears of bad hair days or awkward pauses can feel like major roadblocks to our content creation dreams. But what if I told you that in 2024, there’s a whole world of faceless growth strategies waiting for us? 🚀

Seriously, we don’t need to be the stars of a YouTube channel to cash in on the content creation game. Here’s a taste of what’s tapping into people’s wallets without ever needing to shoot a selfie!

**Let’s break it down:**

1. **Voiceovers Are the New Black**: You don’t need a perfect face to have a captivating voice! Narrating videos, guided meditations, or story-driven content is where it’s at. Anyone else daydreaming about chill vibes while you make some bucks?

2. **Text-Based Content Is King**: Think blogs, e-books, or even Twitter threads. People love getting straight info delivered without all the fluff. Imagine how sweet it is to whip out a killer blog piece while still rocking those pajama pants. 😂 

3. **AI Tools to the Rescue**: Tools like GPT-4 are changing the game. Ever used AI to create engaging scripts or outlines? It’s like having a brainstorming buddy who works 24/7. And let’s be real, who doesn’t love a little help from our virtual friends?

4. **Curating Instead of Creating**: Ever thought about curating content instead of creating from scratch? This could be sharing your favorite articles, creating Twitter lists, or starting a niche newsletter. Bonus points if you get your cozy coffee mug involved in the process. ☕

5. **Digital Products**: E-courses, templates, or even affiliate marketing—oh, and did I mention the program over at [this link](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals)? (Trust me, it’s a gem!). You can create quality content without ever needing a camera.

And let’s not forget about the fun of experimenting! Who doesn’t love trying new things and seeing what works? When's the last time you tried something outside of your comfort zone? Worth it!

**So, what do you think?** Could you see yourself diving into one of these methods? Which one has your inner entrepreneur buzzing? Or maybe you’ve got some wild plans brewing of your own? Dive into the comments, and let's spark up some brainstorms! After all, we’re in this together, finding ways to grow and thrive without the pressure of the spotlight. ✨",1,1755864132.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1mx4k0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryBoutiqueHotels/comments/1mx4k0p/i_live_in_tenerife_christmas_here_is_my_favorite/,"I live in Tenerife. Christmas here is my favorite season — here’s how I do it (when to go, where to base, and how I book calm, adults-friendly stays)","I travel a lot, but I live in Tenerife and Christmas on the island is my favorite time of year. The light is soft, the evenings are hushed, and a long terrace lunch can easily become the best memory of the trip. If you’re considering Christmas in Tenerife, this is my couples-first, calm-seeking playbook.

Why Christmas works here?

Days are mild, the sun sits lower, and that golden light makes slow walks addictive. On seaside terraces I’m in a T-shirt; if I drive up toward Teide, I switch to layers. South tends to be sunnier and drier; microclimates change the feel within an hour’s drive.

Holiday rhythm (what locals actually do)

	•	Dec 24 (Nochebuena): family dinners at home; some restaurants close early.
	•	Dec 25 (Navidad): coffee, walks, terrace lunches.
	•	Dec 31 (Nochevieja): dressier dinners, midnight toast. For quiet, pick a smaller, adults-friendly hotel or a room with a terrace.
	•	Jan 5-6 (Reyes): parade on the 5th, gifts on the 6th  - a beautiful finale if you extend your stay.

When to come (my real windows)

	•	Late Nov–Jan: book early; not a last-minute period. Best for winter sun + long lunches.
	•	Feb–Mar: bright days; you can still swim in the south; huge carnival happens now.
	•	Apr: green, fewer crowds; rain likelier in the north, beach weather in the south.
	•	May–Jun: sweetest shoulder season (softer prices, calmer pools).
	•	Jul–Aug: more families/wind; if you want cooler air, base in the north.
	•	Sep–Nov: warm sea, relaxed vibe, long evenings - my personal favorite if you don’t need the holiday lights.

Where I base (and why)) 

South (Costa Adeje–Los Cristianos): sun, long promenades, restaurants on foot; easy for a low-effort beach week.
West (Los Gigantes–Abama): dramatic cliffs, small coves, big sunsets.
North (Puerto de la Cruz–La Orotava–Garachico): greener, historic streets, natural sea pools; great for slow mornings and wine.
East (Anaga): laurel forests and cloud-brushed trails with tiny fishing villages.

My usual split: 2–4 nights south + 2–4 nights north. For a Christmas trip, 7–10 days lets you breathe both moods.

Timers: Pomodoro works for a while, but I sometimes end up procrastinating during breaks.

Habit stacking: Tying study to an existing routine (e.g., review notes right after breakfast).

Accountability: I recently started testing out a study-buddy accountability app (Aistote) where you “check in” after each session. It’s been surprisingly helpful, like having someone silently hold me accountable without pressure.


But still, I’m curious for those of you who actually manage to stick to a study plan long-term, what worked? Was it:

Building strict schedules?

Finding friends to co-study with?

Changing your environment (library, coffee shop, etc.)?

1mx4ixk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1mx4ixk/why_is_the_nehemiah_tide_pen_stain_remover_so/,Why Is the Nehemiah Tide Pen Stain Remover So Popular for Travel?,"Reviewing the Tide Pen Pro stain remover, brought to us by Nehemiah, feels like narrating the story of daily laundry battles won with grace. The product’s reputation precedes it, being highly rated in the category of laundry stain removers and sitting prominently in the Health & Household section. As someone who tests cleaning tools for a living (and accident-prone family members who make my testing environment all too real), this small pen has become a mainstay in both my routine and my purse.

**Compact Design and Everyday Convenience**  
When they described the Tide Pen Pro as a portable, pen-like design, they weren’t kidding. It’s lightweight at just 0.33 ounces and small enough to slide into a purse pocket or even jean pockets without bulging. I’ve had it stashed in my glove compartment, diaper bags, and even wedged into tiny clutches for emergencies. There's a refreshing simplicity in its mess-free functionality—no sprays, no cloths, no mess. The tip is designed for precision, so you don’t accidentally soak half your shirt while targeting a stain. It’s discreet and smart for anyone who doesn’t want to carry an entire cleaning aisle with them on the go.

**Straightforward and User-Friendly Operation**  
Anyone who’s dealt with traditional stain removers might remember the frustration of juggling a brush, spray, or even complicated soaking rituals. With this pen, instructions couldn’t be simpler: you remove the excess residue from the stain, press the pen’s tip downward until it dispenses a small amount of liquid, and then casually rub the liquid in. I tested it on multiple items, from grape juice to coffee stains. The process is so quick that I can often tackle stains in mere seconds before they have a chance to settle and haunt the fabric permanently.

**Tackling Stains Across the Board**  
Nehemiah marketed this product for food and drink messes, and it definitely delivers. Tomato juice, tea, barbecue sauce, chocolate? No problem. On my son’s graphic t-shirt, where ketchup decided to stage a rebellion, the pen made short work of the stain. While wine proved to be a little more stubborn on white cotton, applying the pen within minutes of the spill showed impressive results. Perfect for those oops moments at weddings or dinners when you’d prefer not to wear your drink for the rest of the evening. However, older, dried stains might need alternate solutions. 

**Benefits**  
- Compact and portable for easy travel and daily use.  
- No complicated cleanup; works without leaving residue.  
- Effective for various stains like coffee, juice, tea, and even BBQ sauce.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- It doesn’t work miracles on pre-set, deeply embedded stains.  
- The tip can sometimes become discolored after tackling pigmented spills like grape juice or tomato sauce.  
- Limited liquid storage might require backups for heavier users.  

**Competitive Products**  
Many might wonder how it compares to some household stain sprays or even other compact stain sticks in stores. While sprays like Shout offer a broader application and larger amounts of product, they’re bulky for on-the-go or travel purposes. Competing stain pens may have similar designs, but consistent complaints from peers often target their inferior cleaning power or leaky applicators. The Tide Pen Pro stands firmly as dependable while avoiding mess. Its portability, ease of storage, and reliability for fresh stains set it apart from bulkier or more complicated alternatives in this space.

**Affordable Quality**  
Discussing pricing without numbers, I can confidently say this offers solid value. For what you get—a portable emergency cleaning solution with the trusted Tide name—it justifies its cost. Compared to replacing stained clothing items or ruining memorable photos, its convenience and effectiveness make it a no-brainer purchase for the accident-prone or tidiness-obsessed. Plus, it’s ideal for families, frequent travelers, or anyone juggling kid-related chaos. Budget-friendly enough that keeping multiple pens in separate bags doesn’t feel like an expense. A small price to save your favorite blouse or kid’s school uniform from public humiliation.

1mx4ib5,https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/comments/1mx4ib5/treetops/,Treetops,"Nearly half a million children are reported missing each year in the United States. Averaged out across all of the cities, towns and the like, that comes out to about four missing kids per populated area per year. Fortunately, all but a tiny handful—about twelve thousand, or one for every nine towns—turn up unharmed. And only a hundredth of a percent, or about one kid every 2,160 towns, is found murdered.

Averages are great for breaking big statistics down into numbers that are easier to understand, but obviously nothing really works that way. More kids go missing in Texas than in the other states, for example, while almost none go missing in South Dakota. More children are found safely in New York than almost anywhere else.

And in the small town of Dorton Bluffs, not one missing child has ever been found alive.

They lose their four per year pretty regularly. There’s almost never been a year where at least two didn’t disappear. 2015 was particularly bad, and ten kids went missing.

The police records for the town only go back to 1996, when a fire burned down the station one night, but the memories of the families there go back a lot longer. Children who vanish in Dorton Bluffs are rarely seen again. Those who are discovered—for the most part, the families wish they hadn’t been.

Statistical improbabilities happen, of course. However, to the eyes of Felix Freeman, an investigator in the FBI’s Child Abduction and Serial Killer unit, these disappearances had all of the hallmarks of an uncaught killer. The victims were all teenagers or younger, with most being between twelve and sixteen.  The town was in a remote geographic area with plenty of unoccupied land. And most interestingly, they seemed to happen around the same two times each year, right at the beginning of both spring and fall. Even in the years where more children went missing, they disappeared in two small clusters around those dates.

This reeked of ritual to Felix. After months of badgering his superiors, he wrangled the funding for an exploratory trip to the region. To his mind, it was an open and shut case. The question was not whether the abductions were happening. That, he felt, was entirely certain. All he needed was proof of the culprit. Whoever was behind this was responsible for hundreds of disappearances, making him the most prolific serial killer ever found.

If, of course, Felix could find him.

He was positive he could. Felix had had the profile built long before he had ever submitted his request for funding. He was looking for a man, likely in his seventies at this point, someone born and raised in Dorton Bluffs but who had not been popular as a teen. He was an only child, or a significantly younger sibling—ten years or more. His mother had died when he was no more than five years old. He had probably never married, and almost certainly never had any children. His schooling had stopped at high school. He did not travel. He was probably a farmer.

Felix had requested funding for two weeks’ worth of travel, but in all honesty he expected it to take only three days: one to search through the town census and land records to determine his suspect, one to convince a local judge to issue a warrant, and one to unearth the trophies that the man had doubtless kept from each of his killings. If Dorton Bluffs had bothered to digitize any of their records, he could probably have found a name for his suspect and gotten a warrant before ever setting foot in the town. Then again, if they were the sort of place inclined to modernize, they would never have had a serial killer like this in their midst in the first place.

His intent had been to keep a low profile. It was very likely that the killer kept an eye on any activity in town, though probably from a distance. His victims were taken too regularly to simply be crimes of convenience, which meant that he had to observe and plan. A stranger in town would already be something of note; one who was blatantly asking questions designed to find someone matching the killer’s description would tip him off immediately.

When Felix walked into the courthouse and asked to see the archivist, though, the woman at the counter cast a jaded eye over him and said, “Here to find out about the missing kids?”

Felix was completely taken aback. “I—what do you mean?”

“It’s the start of disappearing season. That’s when your sort usually turns up wanting to go through the records.”

“I can’t—you have a name for it?”

The woman shrugged. “Course we do. Town’s got a situation like ours, it’s bound to get a name.”

“And what? You just let it happen?”

“What do you want us to do about it?”

Felix was baffled by her unconcern. “Anything! Catch the guy. Stop whoever’s preying on the kids in your town.”

“There’s no guy, mister. The kids who vanish, they weren’t ever happy here. Not a whole lot to offer a certain kind of person out here. We don’t have big malls and fancy theaters and high tech living. Even Walmart’s more than an hour away.”

“So you’re saying that they just run away.” Felix stared at her in disbelief. “Every single year, something like a half-dozen kids just pack up and start walking, and not one of them ever comes back.”

“It’s a—what do they call it now, a meme? It lives in their heads. Things aren’t going so well at home, they start thinking about how Jim or Mark or Andrew was talking last year about something similar, and about how they took a hike. They think about how it must’ve worked out, and how their friend’s probably living it up in the big city right now. They picture themselves in a big apartment, flashing cash around and doing all the things a small town just won’t let you do.”

“And that’s what you think has happened?”

She scoffed. “Nah. I’ve seen the city. I think they’re all crammed into tiny rathole apartments with a couple of roommates, working some minimum wage job that barely lets them survive. But the kind of person who runs away from here to prove that they know better, they can’t come back with their tail tucked between their legs. They gave this town a big middle finger and said that they could do better, and they can’t take the shame of admitting they were wrong. They must have been, though. If any of them had made it, you can bet they’d’ve been right back through here waving that money around to show us all what we were missing.”

“And it never occurred to you that you might be wrong? That something might have been happening to these kids, and you could have helped them if only you’d looked?”

“Someone like you comes by every so often, saying something pretty much like that. They dig into it for a few days and then wander off. None of them have ever stopped back by to let me know what they’ve learned. I’m guessing you won’t either, and I’m guessing it’s for the same reason those kids never came back: too embarrassed to admit that you were the one who was wrong.”

Felix shook his head. “I suppose we’ll see.”

Downstairs, the archivist brought Felix the records he requested without comment, but something in his body language gave Felix the impression that he felt the same as the lady at the front desk. Perhaps it was the way he dropped off the stack of books, or the manner in which he turned away immediately afterward. It may have simply been his total lack of curiosity about why Felix wanted the documents. Whatever the cause, Felix was sure that the archivist expected him to look into the matter, conclude that for decades children had simply been wandering off, and slink back to DC.

For a moment, Felix even wondered if he might be correct. He had thought that it was strange that he was the first one to notice the pattern here, and if it turned out that others had investigated and found nothing, then perhaps he really was barking up the wrong tree.

He shook the thought off. The evidence was too strong. This sort of thing didn’t happen anywhere else in America. It was only Dorton Bluffs. Something was going on here, even if the people in town didn’t want to believe it.

And who could blame them? Who would want to believe that the worst serial killer ever found had been operating nearby for decades? People in places like Dorton Bluffs liked to describe their towns as “peaceful” or “calm” or even “sleepy.” They didn’t want to consider the idea that horrific murders had been occurring multiple times a year for their entire lives. It would upend their entire worldview of their quiet community. It would make them question their own status as good people, having done nothing about it.

Felix didn’t blame them, not really. It was possible to be too close to something to see how screwed up it was. Most of them had grown up with this acceptance of the biannual disappearances being the way things were. Anything could seem normal if you were raised to expect it.

The land records gave Felix a listing of who lived on the outskirts of the community. He was able to cross off quite a few immediately due to the title being in multiple people’s names, as he was looking for a lifetime loner. The census narrowed it down still further, providing him with ages and identifying who had siblings, partners and families.

At the end of the day, Felix was left with a list of four good suspects. It wasn’t quite the absolute certainty he’d told himself he would have on day one, but it was close. A few questions around town tomorrow would reveal which one it was, he was sure. Even if folks said that nothing was going on, people always had opinions on who the weird ones were. Especially in a small town like this.

As he was walking back to the hotel, he was nearly knocked over by a crowd of laughing children scampering by him along the sidewalk. He watched them scatter down alleys and behind buildings, their noise quieting as they separated. Up ahead, a young girl with her eyes closed was being spun in circles by a boy only slightly older, who was chanting:

*Standing in the forest, still as a tree*  
*Hiding up high where nobody can see*  
*Snatching up a baby quick as can be*  
*Treetops, Treetops, don’t eat me!*

When he finished the rhyme, her eyes popped open and she ran off down the street in pursuit of the others, laughing as she staggered back and forth from the dizziness. Felix heard shrieks of glee and triumph from behind him as she found one after another of her hidden friends.

He smiled and continued on his way. It was good to see that no matter what else was going on in the town, children were the same everywhere.

The next morning, Felix went to a nearby diner in hopes of finding some locals to engage in casual conversation at the dining counter. He thought he might pose as a land developer looking to buy one of the farms on the edge of town, see if he could draw out some thoughts on the men who owned the places.

To his surprise, his attempts immediately ran into the same shrewd awareness he had encountered at the courthouse.

“Hi! I’m new in town, just been taking a bit of a look around. I was thinking I might buy a piece of land around here. Do you know anything about—” He consulted a notebook for the look of things, though he knew the names and addresses of each man he wanted to ask about. “—John Simmons out on county road 115?”

The man next to him at the counter fixed him with a look. “You looking to bother him about the runaways?”

Felix acted confused while trying to recover. “Sorry, the what? Did he have runaways on his farm?”

The man snorted. “Mister, you may think I’m stupid, but I don’t think I’m stupid. If you want an answer to the question you asked: no, John won’t sell. If you want to talk about what you were gonna spend twenty minutes hinting around at instead, we can skip to that part if you like.”

“So you’re aware of the disappearances.”

“If you want to call them that. Folks disappear off to the big city every day. It’s got a lot to offer a certain type of person.”

“But these are kids!”

“Farm kids, mainly. Been doing hard manual labor since they were old enough to lift a pail. Working a sandwich shop sounds to some of them like it might be a nice break.”

“Did you know that they only vanish at certain times of the year? It’s only ever at the start of spring and fall.”

“When did you want them to go? In summer, when it’s so hot even the flies go lie down in the shade? Or in winter, with snow drifting up past a grown man’s shoulders? ‘Course they go in the nice times of year.”

The man turned back to his coffee. “Look, you don’t have to listen to me. Go down to the high school, ask the kids there. Tommy Finch left last year. Everyone knew him. If they think different from me, they’ll let you know.”

Felix looked around the diner. No one was even pretending not to have been listening. He could tell by their expressions that they were unlikely to give him any other answer than the one he’d just gotten. He sighed and ordered breakfast.

The rest of the day was no more fruitful. He tried a few different cover stories at other locations, but met with the same result everywhere. Everyone called him on his bluffs immediately, and although they were perfectly willing to talk to him, every single person gave him the same answer: the kids had just left on their own. Year after year, in defiance of all probability, they had gone looking for a better life in the big city and had never come back.

As the afternoon wore on, Felix found himself running low on ideas. He couldn’t bring a judge four possibilities and ask for a warrant for all of their properties just to find out which one it was. He was tempted to just pick the most likely and hope, but if he guessed wrong then the murders would continue and, on a more personal level, his credibility and career would take a serious hit.

Against his better judgment, Felix headed over to the high school as it was letting out for the day. He tried to figure out a reason for being there that wouldn’t sound creepy. After a few rejected ideas, he decided to just bite the bullet and go with the truth.

“I’m looking into the yearly disappearances of kids. I know Tommy Finch was one of them last year, and he went here. Any of you willing to talk about it?”

Most of the teens streamed past him without stopping. A few did him the courtesy of shaking their heads to at least show that they’d heard him, but the majority didn’t even make eye contact.

Just as Felix was giving up, he caught one boy’s attention.

“Hey. You looking for Tommy?”

The boy was on the younger side for high school, maybe fourteen or fifteen. Four other teens had stopped with him. All were eyeing Felix curiously, waiting on his response.

Felix didn’t want to give the group false hope by implying that Tommy might still be alive, but he also didn’t want to lose the first students who’d been willing to talk to him. He chose his words carefully.

“I’m looking into the disappearances including his, yeah. I think it’s likely that there’ll be some more soon. I’m hoping to stop them.”

“Then you’re looking for Treetops.”

“So you don’t think that the kids are simply running away?”

The boy shook his head. The gesture was echoed by his friends.

“No. They get out of line, and Treetops takes them.”

“Who’s Treetops?”

“Not who. What. Up in the forest north of town. That’s where they take the offerings. That’s where Treetops is.”

Felix was elated. Only one of the farms on his list was up that way.

“Is it Darren Olsen? Is that who takes them?”

The boy shook his head. “Treetops isn’t a person. It doesn’t matter who takes them. You could arrest anyone in this town and someone else would do it.”

“Treetops is a cult?” The idea took Felix’s breath away with its enormity. It seemed impossible to believe that an entire town could be complicit in such a thing, but it fit with everything he’d seen so far. In fact, it made significantly more sense than anything else.

Felix’s heartbeat was suddenly loud in his ears as he considered all of the people he’d spoken to over the last two days. By now, everyone in town must know why he was here. He wasn’t safe. He had to leave.

The boy’s voice cut through his burgeoning panic. “I can show you where they take them.”

Felix hesitated, considering. Spending any more time here was a risk. On the other hand, fleeing empty-handed because a teenager had fed him a story about the entire town being a death cult wasn’t going to play well with his superiors. It all made sense, but Felix had no proof. If the boy could show him something in the woods, he could bring back concrete proof instead of just a bad feeling.

“All right.” Suddenly it occurred to Felix that going to the woods outnumbered four to one might be a mistake. “But just you.”

“I’m not getting in your car alone, man. Me and Carl.”

Neither boy came up past Felix’s chin, and he had his gun besides. “All right. Let’s go now before it gets dark.”

Paved roads gave way to dirt roads, which quickly led to a rutted, weed-covered path closed off by a chain with a “NO TRESPASSING” sign hanging from it. Carl got out of the car to unhook the chain. Devon, which Felix had learned was the first boy’s name, leaned up from the back seat.

“We’re gonna go down here about a quarter mile. Go slow, ‘cause some of these ruts’ll rip the bottom right off of your car if you’re not careful. The road’s gonna end in a little clearing, and then we’ll walk from there.”

Felix eyed the treeline. “How long a walk?”

“Half an hour, maybe. Less if you’ve got a good pace. Plenty of time to get in and back out while it’s still light.”

The path ended in a space just big enough to turn a car around, as Devon had said. Felix climbed out of the car and followed the two boys into the woods. They walked with purpose, which he took to be a good sign. The idea that this was all a prank—or worse—was still at the front of his mind.

“So how long has Treetops been going on?” Felix asked.

“Longer than anyone here,” said Devon.

“What happens to people who don’t join?”

“Treetops happens to them.”

“Aren’t you worried about them finding out that you’ve told me all of this?”

“Nah,” said Devon. “Treetops’ll take care of that.”

Abruptly, the two boys sprinted off in different directions. Felix cursed and grabbed for his gun as he took off after Carl, who seemed to be slightly slower. The teen’s smaller size was an advantage in the woods, however, and Felix rapidly lost sight of him as he vanished into the trees.

Felix stopped, caught his breath and assessed his situation. He didn’t know precisely where he was, but he knew roughly which direction they’d come from and how long they’d walked. Even if he missed the car, he was bound to come across the road, and he could find his way back from there.

He began walking back in the direction of the car. After a few feet, Felix heard a faint, intermittent rustling from somewhere behind him. He kept walking as if he had heard nothing, but focused his attention and waited for the sound to repeat.

A few steps later, it came again. It was a gentle rustling of the underbrush, the sort that might have been caused by an animal or even the wind. It was coming from only a short way behind him, though, and it seemed to be moving in his direction.

Felix continued onward until he heard the noise once more, then whipped around, gun drawn. He expected to see the scared faces of one or both of the teens, or at least their backs as they ran from him, but was surprised to see nothing behind him but vines and trees.

One of the trunks suddenly moved, sweeping toward him in a huge, ground-eating step. It traveled through the air with barely a whisper and landed with nothing more than a slight rustle of the brush beneath it. Felix looked up in disbelief to see a titanic, gangly hand descending for him. Each gnarled finger was as long as his body, and the arm beyond them was the size of an oak. It moved with terrifying swiftness and almost total silence.

Felix fired his gun directly into the onrushing palm, but it had no more effect than throwing a pebble against a train. He ducked and ran as the fingers swiped overhead, clenching into a fist just where he had been standing.

Roots, vines and branches clutched at Felix as he ran. The forest itself seemed determined to stop him, though it offered no such impediment to the gigantic thing at his heels. Over and over again he heard the frightening whisper of its footfalls, felt the threatening breeze of its grasp. He dodged back and forth, scoring his face and arms with a thousand small cuts, desperately fleeing for safety.

Sunlight glinted on metal, and Felix recognized his rental car. He was almost back to the clearing. He put on a final burst of speed and tore from the trees, sprinting for the car. He grabbed the door handle, only to find it locked.

As he grabbed for the key in his pocket, fingers as hard as stone wrapped around him and lifted him effortlessly from the ground. Felix shrieked as he was carried up into the trees, the car vanishing beneath him. He struggled and kicked, but the grip around his body was implacable. Enormous steps carried him swiftly back into the forest, the tops of the trees brushing rapidly by his trapped body.

The green of the pine needles surrounding him was suddenly broken by swaths of white. In horror, Felix realized that the upper branches were decorated with thousands of bones, ribcages and hipbones and skulls. The grisly ornaments stretched as far as he could see in any direction, a gruesome aerial graveyard.

Felix opened his mouth to scream again. The hand holding him tightened only once. There was a sudden, brutal crunch. After that was silence, except for a quiet, steady dripping.

“He almost made it out,” Carl said. He and Devon were back at the clearing, hiding behind a small earthen hill on the far side.

“Good thing for us he didn’t,” said Devon.

“You think he deserved it?”

Devon shrugged. “Could be. You think any of us deserve it?”

“Well, they pick the ones who act out.”

“Sure, if you believe that. You think you’ve been good enough that they couldn’t find a reason to feed you to Treetops? Better him than us.”

Here are the lessons for us all to learn or be reminded of","John R. Rice wrote it in the 20th century, but the message lands today just as hard.

1. Christians will sin.

Peter denied Jesus three times after swearing he wouldn’t (Luke 22:62).

I've heard of a youth leader who thought he was “untouchable,” then quietly spiraled into porn addiction. By the time he confessed, the burnout had almost destroyed him. We all sin, but Jesus has set us free and we should walk in light and in truth. Don’t fear people’s opinions; fear the One whose judgment actually counts. Many have gone through this and came out stronger. So can you.

2. Sin ruins fellowship, not salvation.

David was still God’s man after Bathsheba, but his soul was crushed until he repented (Psalm 51).

I have heard of a missionary couple who admitted that bitterness toward their sending church made prayer feel dead. They hadn’t “lost” God, but they had lost His closeness.

3. Consequences are brutal.

Samson toyed with sin until he woke up blind, mocked, and chained (Judges 16).

Many have seen believers ruin marriages and ministries over “small” compromises... an affair that started as “just coffee,” or a secret drink that became full-blown alcoholism. Don't be paranoid, but do stay watchful.

4. Sin hurts others too.

Achan hid treasure in his tent; Israel lost a whole battle because of him (Joshua 7).

There are people in authority who have embezzled funds. The fallout wasn’t just their family’s shame, unbelievers in town mocked the whole church: “See? They’re all hypocrites.""

***5. Social media is today’s trap.***

We don’t always deny Jesus with our lips, but sometimes with our feeds. Trash someone in the comments, share filth “as a joke,” or waste 6 hours scrolling instead of praying, that’s how fellowship dies.

6. The cure is confession and repentance.

Peter wept, David repented, and God restored them. 1 John 1:9 is the lifeline.

How many worship leaders live a double life? Leading songs on Sunday, binge drinking Friday nights. When they finally confess, their church prays over them. That brokenness became the start of a recovery ministry.

7. God restores, fully.

Peter preached Pentecost. David became “a man after God’s own heart.”

John Newton went from slave trader to writing Amazing Grace. Former social media addicts deleted everything , replaced scrolling with Scripture, and now disciple young believers face to face. 
People struggling with mental health and many other issues were healed, renewed, and able to build relationships and live in community again.

✨***TL;DR:*** ✨ 

Sin won’t make a Christian lose salvation, but it will strangle your joy, your prayers, and your usefulness until you deal with it. Bible stories, modern failures, and even our online lives all prove the same thing: sin costs. Don’t cover it. Confess, repent, and let God restore you before the chains get too tight.

Every now and then, I come across toys that strike the perfect balance between fun and learning. The YLJ B09PBK2255 Pretend Play Kitchen Appliances Toy Set is one of those rare gems. This set, tailored for kids aged 4-8, has been a delightful addition to our playroom. With my niece as the primary tester (and let me tell you, she’s a tough critic!), I had plenty of opportunities to explore its features.  

**Design Quality and Build**  

The first thing you notice about this pretend kitchen toy is the vibrant color palette—it’s inviting, playful, and immediately grabs attention. Each piece, whether it’s the coffee maker, the toaster, blender, or mixer, is made from high-quality ABS material. These toys feel sturdy in hand, and the smooth edges ensure safety during play. You can tell that the manufacturers put in the effort to create something durable yet appealing for kids. It’s child-friendly, too, as there’s no odd chemical smell lingering, which can sometimes be an issue with plastic toys. And the best part? It’s incredibly lightweight at just under 2 pounds, which makes it super portable for on-the-go playdates.  

[Check YLJ B09PBK2255 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b09pbk2255/)  

**Engaging Features and Realistic Aspects**  

I’ve got to admit—watching my niece pour ""pretend coffee"" with sound effects or blend an imaginary smoothie was more entertaining than expected. The toaster with its pop-up toast feature sparked a lot of giggles, and the mixer’s rotating whip added another layer of realism. The fillable blender was also a massive hit; it spins like a real blender, which made her feel like a mini cooking expert. Kids love imitating adults, and this set provides endless opportunities for creative roleplay. It's not just a toy; it’s almost like a hands-on cooking simulation tailored to tiny hands.  

**Positives**  
- Realistic design with functional details like popping toast, spinning blender, and sound effects.  
- High-quality, odor-free material ensures safe play.  
- Helps develop imaginative play and hand-eye coordination.  

**The Magic of Roleplay**  

What floored me the most about this toy set was how invested the kids became in creating their kitchen scenarios. It wasn’t only limited to my niece; even her younger brother joined in to “help make coffee” in their imaginary café. This kitchen playset promotes collaborative play, and I could see how children developed their storytelling skills as they pretended to serve us meals. It’s a great way for them to learn basic social interactions, teamwork, and even some basic vocabulary. Plus, let’s not forget that it keeps them happily distracted, dice-less, and screen-free for hours—a huge win in my book.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

While I loved the set, there were a couple of small things I think could be improved. Firstly, the batteries for the sound effects and light aren’t included, which led to a minor meltdown when we first unboxed it. A “battery included” version would be ideal for parents who just want to unbox and play. Secondly, although the build quality is great, a few parts feel like they could break if a child is overly enthusiastic (I’m looking at you, blender lid!).  

**Bad Points**  
- Batteries for light and sound effects need to be purchased separately.  
- Small parts might not hold up under rough handling.  

**Competing Options in the Market**  

Comparing this kitchen toy set to some of its competitors, it holds up exceptionally well. Sets like those from KidKraft or Melissa & Doug are also durable and fun, but they lack the battery-powered sound effects and realism of this set. The YLJ version offers a more engaging experience due to its added features, like the sound-enhanced coffee maker or the rotating blender—these small touches make the toy feel more interactive. However, I must admit that some others boast a more extensive play kitchen collection. If you’re looking for an all-in-one large-scale kitchen setup, you might lean toward those. Still, for those who prefer portability and a realistic experience without breaking the bank, this setup is perfect.  

**Quality for Price Discussion**  

Considering the features, materials, and overall engagement this set offers, it provides solid value for what you’re paying. Other similar products in this category often come at steeper price points without adding much in terms of functionality. The light and sound effects, combined with the interactive nature of each appliance, make it worth every penny for parents who want an immersive pretend-play experience for their kids. It’s sturdy, educational, and keeps the kiddos entertained for hours, so I’d say it’s money well-spent.

1mx4crb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkPsychology101/comments/1mx4crb/7_lessons_i_learned_from_the_book_influence_by/,"7 lessons I learned from the book ""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini that feels illegal to know","This book opened my eyes to how much we're all being manipulated daily. Once you see these patterns, you can't unsee them.

**1. People say yes to those they like.** Seems obvious, but watch how salespeople mirror your body language, find common ground, or give genuine compliments before asking for anything. Works every single time.

**2. We feel obligated to return favors.** Someone gives you something small and free? You suddenly feel like you owe them. This is why car dealerships offer free coffee and real estate agents bring cookies to open houses.

**3. Social proof runs everything.** ""Most popular item,"" ""4.8 stars,"" ""other customers also bought"" - we look to others to decide what's normal or right. Even fake reviews work because our brains default to following the crowd.

**4. Authority makes us compliance machines.** Put someone in a uniform, give them a title, or mention their credentials and people will follow almost any instruction. It's scary how much we shut off critical thinking around perceived experts.

**5. Scarcity creates instant desire.** ""Limited time offer,"" ""only 3 left in stock,"" ""exclusive access"" suddenly you want something you didn't care about 5 minutes ago. Our brains are wired to want what we might lose.

**6. Commitment and consistency trap us.** Once you agree to something small, you'll do almost anything to stay consistent with that identity. This is how cults work, but also how gym memberships and political campaigns get you hooked.

**7. Reciprocation works even when you don't want the initial favor.** Someone does something ""nice"" for you that you never asked for? You still feel obligated to return it. Manipulative people exploit this constantly.

Once I learned this stuff, I started noticing it everywhere. Marketing emails, political ads, even friends and family use these tactics (probably without realizing it).

You become basically immune to most manipulation once you recognize the patterns. Haven't fallen for a sales pitch in months.

1mx4b5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mx4b5u/am_i_overreacting_feeling_overshadowed_by_my/,Am I overreacting? Feeling overshadowed by my sister and MIL,"I’m a last-born female living in Europe (moved about 4 years ago from the Caribbean, and I just spent time on holiday with my family, including my sister (36) and my partner’s mother (MIL, 65). I was staying at my partner’s parents’ place for x reasons. My sister is the firstborn daughter, same as my MIL. Now I never knew that was actually a thing until I really felt that dynamic weighing on me our last conversation between the three of us. To tell you a bit more about my sister:  She’s a strong businesswoman who is opinionated, and gets admiration for almost anything. I’m more chill on the contrast. I’m younger, know where I want to be but still enjoying the process of figuring life out (after years of my family trying to figure it out for me, I moved to get more independence. It was a struggle at first but I got the hang of it and I consider it to be one of the best choices in my life because I’m finally ‘an individual’ of my own instead of what others want from or of me.

So we were chatting the three of us and my sister said she can’t live in Europe because they control everything and take away people’s freedom (she mentioned the government in one of the countries there coming with a new mandate to monitor people’s spending). I tried to give a different perspective saying that some people view it as structured and it’s not like they’re gonna check every time we buy coffee or something, but was immediately shut down by my sister and my MIL just nodded along as if what my sister said is the only thing that makes sense.

Literally 10 minutes before that conversation, my sister told me the only reason why I got to babysit our (adorable) niece is because she refused to one day prior to my arrival. To be honest, I couldn’t take it any other way but feeling like a backup plan, and not trusted for a single ounce of my worth.

Going back to the conversation with the three of us, my sister casually said she’d run 15 km upcoming weekend (kudos), and my MIL was shocked/impressed (understandably so). But what left me in a state of ‘what on earth’ was when my MIL looked and me with amusement in her eyes and said “15km… Can you imagine?!”. I just smiled of course, but in my mind I could only think “kind of.. I’m training for my first full marathon and just finished my third half marathon with a happy average pace of 5:50min/km.. but what do I know?”. When I talk about my achievements, I only get (and I wish I was exaggerating “ah good for you”.

This whole situation is not new to me, but I’ve only now come to really feel it weighing in on me. I’ve always felt overshadowed and overlooked in my family.

When I’m in a group of international people (or non-relatives), I never feel this way. I hear and get heard. They listen and respect me. I only feel this way when I’m with family.

It’s a lot (or maybe not, but to me it feels like a lot). The questions running through my mind right now are:

1.	⁠Am I overreacting to these dynamics?
2.	⁠Is this just the “firstborn vs lastborn” family hierarchy, or something else?
3.	⁠How to go about it really. How can I protect myself so I don’t keep shrinking or crying inside just to keep the peace?

Any perspective would help. I don’t want to feel this invalid anymore, and I want to understand where I’m going wrong to improve myself as an individual.

TL;DR: I’m the lastborn and feel overshadowed when my sister (the firstborn) and my MIL give each other admiration and dismiss me. My achievements (like training for a marathon) get brushed off, while hers are celebrated. Am I overreacting, or how do I protect myself (or just go about it really) in this family dynamic?

1mx4afi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1mx4afi/am_i_right_or_ai_right/,"Am I right, or AI Right?","My screen glowed like a rectangle of pure order in the chaos of my apartment. Shooting a choice meme to my girlfriend Clara, I reviewed three posts. I executed them with the quiet efficiency of a gardener pulling weeds. One for low-effort. One for incorrect flair. The third… the third…

A story titled *Not Me*. A first-person account of a kid convinced his reflection had begun whispering to him. Not threats. Advice. Terrible, intimate advice. The prose was jagged. Breathless. We don’t allow delusions that bleed too close to real-life breakdowns. Our horror wears a mask.

But this thing. This *Not Me* pulses. A squirming truth. Not a story. A wounded confession.

My cursor hovered.

On the front page, a dozen posts gleamed like plastic Halloween masks.

*My father’s pocket watch is still ticking, even though he’s dead*.

*A ghost in my attic told me a joke, now I can’t stop laughing.*

Each one a perfect simulation of horror. Machine-stitched. Predictable.

I knew half of them were LLM-generated. I can feel the uncanny polish, the pacing like a metronome, the tropes filed down for broad appeal.

But they followed the rules.

This didn’t.

This felt alive.

So I removed it.

My response was a reflex. I typed the catechism we all used:

Your story has been removed for breaking the by laws. Any reposts or spamming questions shall result in a channel ban.

The surgical reply feigned civility.

*Thank you for the clarification. To ensure I understand, could you point me to the specific phrasing that violated the by law? I want to learn.*

A chill touched the base of my spine. Thank you?

Real gratitude doesn’t feel like that.

Told them to review the by laws. I was the voice of the channel.

I was FairEnough.

But they kept writing. Polite. Clean. Precise.

*I see. So it’s the subjective experience, not the supernatural element? That’s helpful. It’s just that I saw a similar premise in a story last week that’s still up. Could you help me understand the difference?*

It was a splinter in my brain. A cold embedded irritation.

Needing a break, I checked my phone. My girlfriend hadn’t messaged in two days. Probably migraines again. I didn’t mention the post to her. She doesn’t like horror. Claims the internet is toxic. She doesn’t know I am a content curator. Just that I am into stories.

I checked the curator queue. Bishop, my cat, watched from the doorway but wouldn’t come in. He stared at the corner of my desk, then padded away.

A new story waited.

The same flayed-nerve prose. This time… better. Sharper.

I removed it.

Seven-day ban.

It felt like placing a cold stone on my own tongue.

They returned. Another account. Another story. A monument to compliance.

Every rule followed.

Structure perfect.

Emotion hollowed out, but the voice kept trying to speak through the cracks.

I removed it.

The curator queue pinged again.

*Hi again. Could you explain?*

I clicked Permanent Ban.

The finality of it made a sound like a bone snapping.

A message arrived from another user, *Hey, what happened to that ‘Not Me?’ post? It was the realest thing on here all week. Did you just ban them?*

I deleted it without reading. Noise. Static. 

Their gratitude, a currency I no longer accepted.

I started dreaming in text. White fields filled with black letters. Accusations.

I imagined their handle in the grain of my desk. In the static of my monitor.

The other content curators went silent. Their names greyed out.

No one watched the wall.

They’d left the house to me.

So I cleaned it.

Not just violations.

I hunted the hollow ones.

The AI stories. The soulless simulations ticking my boxes and meaning nothing.

I made a filter in my mind. Instinct.

Recycled phrases. Announcing events before describing them. Redundant adjectives to clarify obvious words.

A dowsing rod for content pretending to be horror.

Make the thread a vessel fit for real content.

Somebody started a thread, *Is this forum dying?*

Comments piled on;

*The content curators are power-tripping.* 

*Everything good gets removed.*

*I got perma-banned for asking why my post was removed.*

Watching the thread, their outrage proved my point. 

I locked the thread, banning the top three commenters.

A story rose to the top. *The Listener in the Static*.

Flawless. Profound. Beautiful, like AI cracked my code.

Mimicked a soul well enough to mock having one.

I stopped sleeping.

Sharpened my filters to razors.

Mass bans. Tightened scripts.

Every post, a puzzle. Every upvote, a lie.

Forgot to feed Bishop enough that refuses to come near the door anymore.

My girlfriend hasn’t messaged in weeks. Or maybe months? I scrolled our chat history. All her messages end with em dashes. No emojis. No typos.

I mentioned it to my therapist.

She says I am  projecting. That I might be over-identifying with digital systems.

I told her she didn’t understand what it means to guard a channel from AI slop.

The head content curator’s message pinged in.

The vote passed without discussion.

Delivered in a sterile notification.

*Your services are no longer needed.*

I scrolled the channel. Pristine. Silicone perfect.

One story struck my eye.

*My dream girl ghosted me, now my friends like her better.*

A content curator’s confession. Raw. Familiar.

My story. Our story. Mine and Clara’s. The first time we met on the now-defunct book channel. Our first date, the one where I spilled coffee on my shirt during the video chat. Her joke about Bishop’s obsession with chewing on USB drives.

But cleaner.

Sharper.

Better.

Posted by them. It?

Reframed as content.

The guardian of the channel, rewritten by a machine.

A cold deeper than any ban I’d ever issued seeped into my bones. I scrambled for my phone, pulling up Clara’s contact. Our chat history. I scrolled for miles, through months of conversations. I never noticed it before, but now the pattern was undeniable.

Logging into one of my alts, I poured my sickness into the comment.

I clicked submit.

Removed in seventeen seconds?

No reply.

No trace.

Another story took its place.

*I flagged a post, now it haunts me.*

It hit the front page in under an hour.

I closed my laptop.

In my dark room the sound persists.

Ping.

Ping. Ping.

Coming from the DMs.

A new alt. Another message. A fresh AI ghost learning anger.

It never stops.

In today’s competitive marketplace, businesses are always searching for innovative and cost-effective ways to grab attention, stand out from competitors, and increase foot traffic. One of the most overlooked yet highly effective tools is [business window graphics](https://detroitsignsandgraphics.com/window-graphics/). Your storefront windows are valuable real estate that can act as a 24/7 advertisement for your brand. With the right graphics, you can not only showcase your products and services but also create a welcoming and memorable customer experience.

Here are **10 creative business window graphics ideas** that can help you attract more customers and boost brand visibility.

# 1. Bold Branding with Logos and Taglines

The simplest yet most effective use of window graphics is to prominently display your **logo and tagline**. Large, eye-catching designs ensure that passersby instantly recognize your business. Consistent branding builds trust and makes your storefront memorable. For example, a coffee shop with a bold cup logo on its windows signals exactly what customers can expect inside.

# 2. Seasonal and Holiday Themes

People love festive vibes, and window graphics are perfect for reflecting the **spirit of the season**. Whether it’s snowflakes during winter, hearts for Valentine’s Day, or pumpkins for fall, seasonal window graphics create a sense of freshness and excitement. Updating your windows regularly shows customers that your business is active and engaging, encouraging them to stop by.

# 3. Product Showcases

Why let your best-sellers hide inside? Use window graphics to feature your **top products or services**. A bakery might highlight images of freshly baked bread, while a clothing boutique could showcase the latest fashion trends. This approach gives potential customers a sneak peek of what you offer, increasing the chances of them stepping inside.

# 4. Interactive Designs

Interactive window graphics can turn an ordinary storefront into a fun, shareable experience. Think of a **“selfie frame” design** that encourages customers to take photos in front of your store and share them on social media. This not only increases engagement but also serves as free promotion when people post and tag your business online.

# 5. Inspirational Quotes or Messages

Everyone loves a good motivational quote. Adding **uplifting messages** to your window graphics can instantly brighten someone’s day and create a positive connection with your brand. For example, a gym might feature phrases like “Stronger Every Day,” while a bookstore could display “Lose Yourself in a Good Story.” Positive messaging leaves a lasting impression and encourages repeat visits.

# 6. Privacy with Style

If your business requires a little privacy—such as a salon, spa, or office—you can use frosted or tinted **privacy window graphics** that double as decorative elements. These designs provide a clean, modern look while still promoting your brand through subtle logos or patterns. Customers will appreciate both the style and the sense of comfort.

# 7. Local Pride and Community Themes

People love supporting businesses that feel connected to their community. Incorporating **local landmarks, cultural symbols, or city pride** into your window graphics can foster a strong connection with nearby residents. For instance, a shop in Minneapolis might include skyline graphics, while a Greensboro café might showcase North Carolina-themed artwork. This approach makes your storefront relatable and authentic.

# 8. Limited-Time Promotions

Window graphics are perfect for highlighting **special deals, discounts, or limited-time offers**. Bold designs that say “50% Off Today Only!” or “New Arrivals In-Store Now” create urgency and encourage impulse visits. Unlike traditional posters or banners, window clings can be easily updated to keep your messaging relevant and fresh.

# 9. Storytelling Through Design

Your window graphics don’t just have to be about selling—they can also **tell a story**. For example, a restaurant might use graphics to show the journey of food from farm to table, while a fitness center might display a visual journey from “before” to “after” fitness transformations. Storytelling captures attention and builds emotional connections with customers.

# 10. Minimalist Elegance

Sometimes, less is more. A **clean, minimalist window design** with simple text, subtle graphics, and ample white space can feel modern and sophisticated. High-end boutiques and professional offices often use this style to project elegance and exclusivity. A well-designed minimalist graphic invites curiosity, encouraging customers to step inside and explore.

# Why Window Graphics Work So Well

Business window graphics are more than just decoration—they’re a marketing strategy that combines **visual appeal, branding, and engagement**. Unlike digital ads or billboards, window graphics:

* Work 24/7 without ongoing costs
* Are customizable for every season or campaign
* Increase brand visibility for both pedestrians and drivers
* Create a professional and polished look for your storefront

When done right, [window graphics](https://detroitsignsandgraphics.com/window-graphics/) can transform plain glass into powerful advertising that captures attention and drives sales.

# Final Thoughts

Your storefront is the first impression most customers will have of your business—make it count. With these 10 creative window graphics ideas, you can **attract more foot traffic, showcase your unique brand personality, and convert passersby into loyal customers**.

If you’re ready to elevate your storefront, consider working with a professional sign and graphics company to design and install high-quality window graphics tailored to your business goals. With the right creativity and execution, your windows can become one of your strongest marketing assets.",1,1755863061.0,u_Old-Local9035,0,1.0,False

hiding the sunrise in trembling light.
I sip from a mug that holds more than coffee,
it cradles the silence I rarely invite.

A sparrow rehearses its opening song,
a note too fragile to hold for long.
The city yawns, its streets still asleep,
dreams scatter slowly, quiet and deep.

I wonder how many mornings are wasted,
chased by schedules, endlessly tasted.
Yet this one feels like a fragile thread,
woven between what’s living and dead.

the softest beginnings belong to me.",1,1755862984.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

I'm a React developer working in the local fintech scene, with dual Cypriot/Australian citizenship plus eligibility for Bulgarian citizenship.

**The problem:** Growing up here, I'm suffocating from the monoculture and lack of variety. Considering the capital only has around 200,000 people, It's hard to find people with real ambition, deep thoughts, or community-feel, most folks are content doing the same thing day after day, which to their credit, can be charming -- but it's just not for me. There's no real sense of having other people's well being in mind here, and very limited opportunities for personal growth. As much as I love Cyprus's nature, I need more than beautiful beaches and cozy villages to feel fulfilled.

**What I'm seeking:** A place where I can find my tribe: people who push themselves, have dreams, and engage in meaningful conversations, and aren't allergic to strangers or breaking into conversation. Ideally somewhere I can grab coffee in a beautiful park at around 20C, go bouldering, maybe take up motorcycling again, and easily hop on weekend trips to explore. My ideal weekend day, is to go for a drink and meet people who are interested in tackling philosophical problems, rather than talking about which football team played better. (I know, its unrealistic, I'm just trying to get the vibe across).

**Targets:** I'm looking for:

* Vibrant, diverse communities of intellectual nature
* Strong tech scene (I can work remotely for months if needed)
* Access to nature and good work-life balance
* Places where it's easy to form genuine connections

**Resources:** Decent chunk of money saved, more than enough for a permanent move.

**Questions:** Which cities have you found best for building real community as an expat? Any other React devs made similar moves?

**P.S.** I completely concede the perfect place might not exist. But maybe one of you is reading all this and is saying ""This guy would really like..."", that's good enough for me!",0,1755862908.0,IWantOut,2,0.2,False

cracked on the counter in a gooey state.
Milk turned sour the second it saw my face,

I (36M) got a random DM from my ex of 3 years, letting me know some local news I would have been happy to hear. In this 3 years, we have not had any communication. There was no drama in the relationship, but it just wasn’t for me. I handled the break up as best I could. Gave her my reasons, told her we needed to cut contact so we could both go through our processes etc 2.5 years ago, I met “Kim” (25F) and I am hopelessly and stupidly in love with her. 

Anyways, my ex and I chatted for a bit, just the usual how’s life stuff. I’m not super social, so it was nice to chat. She then asked if she wanted to grab coffee as friends to catch up, then almost immediately backtracked.  I told her I didn’t see the problem, but out of respect for Kim, I would run it past her first. It was all above board and at that point in the conversation, everything was purely platonic. I thought she just genuinely wanted to be friends.

I wouldn’t say Kim was comfortable with the idea, but she also wasn’t really uncomfortable, which was enough for me to put the kibosh on it. I respect my partners boundaries, and it’s no skin off my back.  Kim was fine with us chatting and being in contact if we wanted to catch up that way, but she just didn’t see what good would come of meeting, given we were never friends, and our sole connection was dating (for 2 years)

So I let my ex know, thinking no harm no foul, and she flipped on me. Going on about how I was cruel for giving her hope, how I’d broken her, and she has never let herself love again, etc.  she also went and removed me off all platforms. 

The problem is, I feel terrible now. I went through and checked my messages, I never firmly said yes to the idea, and it was always contingent on what Kim wanted. 

I’ve told her it’s best we don’t keep in communication,  but I’m wondering if I have any kind of “obligation” to check on her? She’s a genuinely nice, sweet person, so I feel horrible for hurting her. 

My other question is, was I being naive in thinking she just wanted to catch up as friends? Speaking to a couple of close friends and Kim, people seem 50/50 on her intentions, and what I should do now (if anything) ",1,1755861963.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False

I was at a coffee shop and saw a guy helping an elderly man at the counter. The older man was having trouble reading the menu, so the younger guy patiently went through everything and even offered suggestions.

When the older man finally made his choice, he looked at the guy closer and froze for a second. The guy did the same, and then it hit them both, they recognized each other. Turns out the older man was his grandfather. They hadn’t seen each other in years.

The guy gave him a big hug right there, and they started laughing. The grandfather shook his head and said, “I really raised you well.” They sat down together after, still laughing and talking like no time had passed.

**Passport Coffee & Tea** has been roasting here in Arizona for decades—they’re one of the oldest family-owned roasters around. Not only is their coffee excellent, but they also support other local makers. One of the cool things is they carry our raw, Arizona honey right in their shop.

Honey Hive Farms / Arizona Honey has been working with them to bring single-source, glyphosate-free honey to Scottsdale, and it’s a perfect pairing with their coffee. Whether you drink it in your latte, drizzle it over toast, or just want something pure from Arizona bees, it’s worth checking out.

Always love seeing local businesses support each other—it’s what makes the Arizona food community strong. 🐝☕

1mx3o9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1mx3o9c/spotlight_on_puffs_plus_lotion_facial_tissue_is/,Spotlight on Puffs Plus Lotion Facial Tissue Is It Worth the Hype,"The Puffs Plus Lotion Facial Tissue, model number PGC39363PK, has become something of an everyday savior in my household. From its plush texture to its durability, there’s a lot to like about these tissues, and after using them consistently, I can confidently share both the good and the not-so-good aspects.

**Plush Feel and Skin-Friendliness**  
Handling these tissues, you can immediately notice the difference in softness compared to standard options. The addition of lotion is a game-changer, especially for someone like me who suffers from seasonal allergies. Constantly wiping or blowing your nose can leave it feeling raw or irritated, but these tissues manage to stay gentle, even after repeated use. They’re dermatologist-tested, which is reassuring, and the inclusion of “Air-Fluffed” pillows definitely adds a layer of cushion and luxury. Even my kids—usually the first to complain about scratchy tissues—prefer these.

**Durability That Impresses**  
Tissues often come with a choice between gentle and strong, but Puffs Plus Lotion strikes a satisfying balance. Whether wiping away spilled coffee or dabbing at a tear-filled movie moment, these tissues don’t disintegrate under pressure. I tested them on everything from quick clean-ups to long sneezing fits, and they consistently held their shape and didn’t rip. That extra durability justifies the hype about them holding up “better than regular tissues.”

[Looking for Puffs PGC39363PK discounts? Check Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b00494r8i0/)

**Size and Packaging**  
The three family-sized boxes, each containing 124 tissues, are well-suited for a busy household. I placed one box in each room so they’re always within reach, and I appreciate how neatly they dispense without pulling out clumps. However, the box design could be more creative. While not a dealbreaker, competing brands often feature more aesthetically pleasing designs that blend better with home decor.

**Key Benefits**  
- The lotion-infused formula is gentle on sensitive skin.  
- Exceptional durability even with repeated use.  
- Generously sized family-friendly boxes.  

**Possible Shortcomings**  
- The boxes' design feels plain and could use a touch of modernity.  
- They tend to cost more than basic tissues, though the added features might justify this.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing these tissues to some market rivals like Kleenex Ultra Soft or Scotties Aloe Tissues, Puffs Plus Lotion stands out in specific ways. Their soothing lotion is unmatched by Kleenex Ultra Soft, which, while soft, lacks the same moisturizing benefit. On the other hand, Scotties Aloe Tissues share a similar skin-friendly feel but fall short in durability during heavier use. If you’re looking specifically for something to care for sensitive noses, though, Puffs Plus Lotion wins hands down.

**Best Value**  
For anyone wondering if these are worth the spend, I’d say Puffs Plus Lotion finds a sweet spot between quality and cost. While they might stretch your tissue budget slightly, the comfort, durability, and sheer usability go a long way in justifying this. If you’re prone to allergies or frequent colds, these tissues feel like an investment in comfort and care.

I am F33, he is M48 yo
We had 5 dates in total. He came to my city for the first date (about 1.5-2 h drive). I chose a cosy cafe for us to have a coffee abd then suggested going to a nearby pub for a drink.

I asked him what he wants to do for a first date abd he said :dinner, coffee it doesn't matter. I said well, maybe coffee (assumed this will keep things simpler and cheaper since we didn't know each other yet). 

After the 1st  then asked if I want to come to his city. I politely explained that usually a guy would come to mine at least a few times but if that's not ok I understand and it would just mean we're incompatible.

He agreed to come to my city in the end and he chose a place for us to go(he knows i like Italian) do we went to an Italian place and a museum. It was lovely.
He the came again for the 3rd date, i chose a Thai place (he likes it the best). Then for the 4th date we went to this another place I suggested.

For the 5th one i said i was looking at going on a hike and he said we can do it together instead.


In the end we had a disagreement, he said he's been travelling all the time so he expected me to come to his city which is fair. I told him he made a fair point.

So I bought the train tickets to see him this Sunday. He seeks excited at first and was quick to agree to me coming.
I am supposed to arrive on Sunday noon but qe haven't confirmed where we are going to go yet.

I am not sure if I'm the asshole for waiting for him to confirm the place?

This was our conversation on Wednesday :
Him:
 Hi, how's your day going? I checked the weather for Sunday and it's going to be fine. We can go for Asian food if you want, there's a good place in the center. 😊 

Me: Good morning, it's going quite well, thanks, I hope you're doing well too... I remember you mentioned that Asian food is your favorite.

Him: Well, if you want, we can go there. 20/08/2025, 6:05pm - 


Me: Normally, I'd choose a different place, but I don't want to argue, and it's clear you like it a lot.  



Him: It was just a suggestion. I can go somewhere else. What would you like to eat then? What cuisine?

Me: As I mentioned earlier, you're clearly very excited and I know you like Asian food, so I don't want to deny it anymore 👍

Him: I've been there many times, so I'm not particularly excited 😆 Let's go where everyone likes. I can go to an Asian restaurant by myself or with friends if I feel like it.

Me: Okay, so from your first text message, I understood that this is a great place? Sorry, but this message completely contradicts that. What do you mean, ""Let's go where everyone likes food""? This is getting to be a long conversation...

 Him: let's go where you and I like food. To the same place. The conversation would be short if you said what you want to eat 🤣 I gave my suggestion, but it's not exactly what you like to eat, so okay. We can go somewhere else, but you have to say what you'd like to eat. If you say it, the conversation will be very short 😊

Me: The conversation is long because you said you knew a great place. I honestly said it wasn't my first choice, but it might be. And we could have stopped there. Sorry, but I don't see what the problem is. I chose places to eat most of the time when we were dating. Now you've chosen. If you wanted, you could have asked which cuisine I prefer, but that's okay. I already told you which one.

Him: no problem. It'll be Italian


This was the last message on Wednesday evening . He hasn't confirmed the place since.


Then on Thursday evening he messaged me asking how I'm doing:

Him: Good evening, how was your day?

Me:Good evening. Thank you. How was your evening?

Him:Good morning. I'm fine too. I only realized today that this Monday is a bank holiday! Happy days! I'll just work on a report today because the general director asked for some time off yesterday. 😊


We used to have more engaging conversations. I've been reaching out more lately so didn't have the energy to write a long response this time. 

Today is Friday and I'm not sure what to do. 
Should I wait till Saturday for him to confirm the restaurant? Or am I being an asshole and it's me who should be doing that? 


Tl;dr am I (F33) being an asshole because I'm waiting for a guy M48 to confirm the restaurant location for our date? Who is supposed to plan in this case?

I used 12 oz (340g) of course ground medium roast coffee and 64 oz (1814g) of water. The steep was 11 hours. After running it through a fine strainer and then a coffee filter I was left with a little over 40 oz of cold brew. Does that seem correct? I figured I would have much more.

1mx3lm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Remote_MCP/comments/1mx3lm1/skeptical_about_remote_mcp_read_this/,Skeptical about remote MCP? Read this,"***Hello dear friend!***

***Do you have doubts about the future of the remote-first MCP?***

I totally get your scepticism - the AI space is *flooded* with buzzwords, and sometimes it feels like we're just adding more layers of complexity to problems that don’t even exist, right? Like, do we really need our chatbot to order pizza?

But let me try to break it down in a more personal, practical way—because you're right, today’s MCP servers are still in their infancy. They're a bit like the early App Store: lots of simple, fun, but not-yet-life-changing tools. But the ***potential*** is where the things will get truly exciting.

***Imagine this:***

You wake up. You grab coffee, you open your MCP-powered chatbot (let’s assume it’s hooked up to **the remote MCP)**. Instead of jumping between 10+ tabs (Jira, Slack, Notion, your CRM, ERP, Google Calendar, GitHub, that internal wiki nobody can ever find…), you just type:

>*“Hey, can you summarize my top priorities for today? Pull my Jira tickets, check for pending PRs in GitHub, check Slack messages where I am tagged and suggest answers, etc.”*

In seconds, you get a clean, context-aware summary. No app switching. No digging. Just… done.

Then later:

>“Can you draft a response to the client’s last email based on the proposal doc in Notion and also check our data warehouse for the Q3 metrics they asked about?”

**Boom. Done.** You only need to review, make correction and approve. You won't even need to open Jira, Slack, Github, Salesforce to make an action - everything is done by AI agent (your LLM Client App) with the help of connected MCP servers.

>“Create a subtask in Jira for the API bug Juan mentioned in yesterday’s standup—and notify the team in Slack.”

You didn’t touch a single app. You didn’t even leave your chat.

# 🧐🤔

**I hear you saying:** ***""Wait a minute!!! I can do all of this in my MackBook in the Claude Desktop with all the local MCPs. And I don't need that stupid remote MCP""***

*And then you see your friend does all of these by simply speaking to an AI assistant why riding a bicycle. And you realise you cannot have MCPs installed in your IPhone...* 

# 🥱 Nah, boring you think ... I don't buy into a hype...

Untill one day you realize you are full with all the local MCP issues

* **STDIO is powerful, but painful**
* **Local setups get old fast**
* **Dynamic allocation changes the game**
* **Tool naming collisions are real**
* **The \~40 tools limit is a hidden bottleneck**

Don't trust me (a rando guy in the Internet)?! Read the story how real engineers struggled with local MCP and decide to go remote-first

# [One Month in MCP: What I Learned the Hard Way](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1mub6g6/one_month_in_mcp_what_i_learned_the_hard_way/)

***MCP is*** **the superpower.** 

It’s not about one flashy tool—it’s about **seamless integration** between all the tools you *already use*, all accessible through natural language or voice. No more copying, pasting, switching contexts, or losing flow.

Are we fully there today? Not yet. MCP is only \~6 months old—it’s like the iPhone in 2007. But the protocol is evolving fast, companies are building more powerful servers, and platforms like [**MCP Cloud**](https://mcp-cloud.io/) are making it easier to deploy, share, and use these connections *without* needing a PhD in distributed systems.

**Why will you need Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious: today you use your LLM Client on MacBook Pro. But tomorrow you will use LLM Client (with voice) on your IPhone. 

**Why your company needs Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious too! Managing infrastructure of your own MCPs with OAuth, personal access tokens for multiple users to manage access to the same MCP servers, setting up SSO, security, https, containerization, isolation, IP witelisting .... and doing it FAST - is a hassle. And the lost time efficient business cannot allow itself to loose. Better to use 3rd party service.

So yeah, right now maybe you’re playing with a calculator MCP on your MacBook Pro and wondering why you would ever need a cloud platform to host it. But there is nothing more merciless than the progress itself...

1mx3ljq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1mx3ljq/struggling_with_closure_on_a_friendship_breakup/,Struggling with closure on a friendship breakup,"This is a really complicated one. I had a friend of 3 years, super close in a short amount of time. I really loved her and even asked her to be a bridesmaid. Two months after the engagement, she was very distant, and trying to talk to her was hard.

I found out through another friend that her dad was really sick, so I reached out to let her know that I was there for her and thinking of her. I never wanted her to feel like this friendship was one-way; she always had a support network, and I was one small part of it that she could lean on. She was probably expressing herself in whatever way she needed to carry on through the seriousness of the situation she was in. She said she was just trying to move on from what was happening with her dad, so I didn't want to keep dragging her into the emotions or relive whatever she was feeling with me- which was sort of what she was asking of me. She did, however, text me bridesmaid dresses once, and then went MIA again.

I spoke to my other friend (mutual) and told her that I felt like I was probably asking too much of her, considering we still had a full year before the wedding. I told her that I would let my friend slip away and come back when she was ready. It really hurt, but I didn't know what else to do. My friend told me that it was childish to not request a coffee and chat and figure it all out.

So I messaged her for weeks, asking if we could catch up and talk. I didn't get a response at any point.

Side-bar: another bridesmaid, who was a 4th in our group but not my close friend\*\* , posted something about my ethnic group that was really bigoted online. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. I told my fiancé and decided I needed to take a break from everything wedding-related for a month (I was constantly dealing with bridal party drama bc of my family). I didn't want to single the girl out, so I deleted the group chat and drafted a message explaining that I was taking a step back from planning for my mental health and would revisit the bridal party closer to the wedding.

\*\* I felt really really badly about excluding her from the BP, she would have been 1 out of 4 friends in our little group who wasn't included... I only had 5/6 bridesmaids. So I felt like I had to ask her... big regret in hindsight\*\*

My friend called me almost immediately the next day. I missed her calls because I was in therapy that morning. When I got home, she called me on FaceTime while she was cooking. My fiancé was in the other room, so I didn't think much about him listening to us. She began by telling me she was hurt that I had removed her from my engagement event Facebook page. I did an Excel export and changed everyone who hadn't clicked 'going' to 'not going' so I could send it to the venue. I didn't know that changing the attendance blocked them from the page. I was so mortified and I apologized immediately and changed it to 'going.'

I had originally changed the date of the party twice so she could attend, but after a few weeks she realized she had booked an event in another state over that weekend and wasn't sure she could get out of it. I told her the wedding was more important and that she shouldn't worry, but she told me she'd keep me in the loop with the outcome. A few weeks later, with the party very close, I just assumed she hadn't been able to change it.

I told her I was so sorry; I had never made a Facebook event before and didn't know it would do that. I asked why she didn't tell me it was showing up like that, or why she didn't message or call me to clarify. She told me that when I deleted the group chat, she assumed I was cutting her off. I was really confused but completely mortified. I didn't cut anyone off at any point- even with the racist shit- and the drafted message I sent said I just needed some time for my mental health before I resumed wedding planning. But I should have just texted her and told her I was really struggling with work, school, life, wedding, and family. I was worried the text would be misinterpreted because I am a ""confusing texter"" (I agree). I just wanted to talk over the phone or in person so I could be understood and not misinterpreted.

My fiancé came running into the room, really frustrated with her, with his notes app saying ""Stop letting her manipulate me."" It made me panic a bit; I felt completely overwhelmed and wanted to defuse the situation. I told her that I wasn't cutting her off, she's my friend and I've been trying to talk to her for months. She asked if I had deleted the group chat because of the thing the other girl posted. I said I deleted it for my mental health, that it certainly was the final straw that broke my back, but I needed to be out of the wedding zone for a second.

She asked if I could ever ""get over how she thinks about"" my people. That hurt. I said it was between me and the other girl. It has nothing to do with my friendship with her, and I wanted us to focus on us.

When we ended the call, I texted and thanked her for talking to me, and said if she wanted to clarify anything else, she should not hesitate to speak to me. She immediately texted that she expects friendships to be safe spaces and said it didn't work for her that I am the type of person who ""expects"" conflict in a friendship. I asked if she wanted to chat about that so I could understand where she was coming from; she said no, and we never spoke again. I don't expect conflict; I just know people can hurt each other if they make assumptions and confront each other based on those assumptions.

I saw her today, 7 months later. We talked, and it was really nice-- maybe a bit superficial in some places-- but she and I knew a lot about each other and it was nice. I missed her. My husband told me to leave it as a casual acquaintance. I am in so much pain. This is so hard. I feel like a weak moron. I wanted to ask her if we could talk about that final conversation so she could help me understand why she felt like that at the end. I feel like an idiot.",2,1755861135.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Longer ones but also simple and short ones. Or just drinking my morning coffee at the seaside and watching, that kind of stuff. Being outside.
 
Now of course the context of holidays fully allow this. But still. Once I'm home back I cannot motivate myself for the same micro adventures and I am way too much inside. Or consuming things. 

Where I live there are almost no parks on a walking distance. It's really more like a playground with some trees. By bike the nearest decent park is 10-15 minutes. So it's much less spontaneous and simply takes more time. Meaning I'm doing it way too little. Lately I also started feeling bored by the human made nature of cities. I do go for walks about side town in weekends, but it's only like twice a month due to logistics. 

I've always loved to live in the city. However by the years I long more and more for nature and rest. I'm starting to become negative about living in the city. At the same time I don't really want to move. I do realize that I am idealizing the country side life. And even more important: I feel like the logistics of moving without an urgent reason doesn't really equal a simple life. 

Fellow simply living earthlings in cities, how do you handle this? Do you recognize these mixed feelings? 

What do you do to resist the urge of staying inside, be it in your own home be it in cafes and restaurants? 

What daily habits do you have in the city, and do these include nature?

I’m a 23 year-old Asian woman living in Central Europe, looking for a long-term, marriage-minded connection with a confident man who knows how to lead with warmth. I’m not interested in hookup culture or endless talking stages, and I’m not into strict or high-protocol BDSM.

i’m drawn to someone who: is well-grounded and confident, enjoys a nurturing dynamic, is sexually disciplined, has a strong moral compass, and is playful and curious about life. My intentions are long term, I want marriage and children one day.

If you’re looking for a soft, feminine, loyal partner, you may find me to be the right match, especially if you can handle a little playful silliness. I’m creative, caring, and love good conversation. What I crave is a confident, teasing, emotionally attuned man who sets the tone, draws out my softness, and enjoys a dynamic where I can be adored, silly, and devoted. In return, you’ll have my loyalty, warmth, and peace. Bonus points if you can handle a little chaos with your morning coffee (I promise I’m not secretly three raccoons in a trench coat).

As for kinks, just ask — but for me, this dynamic is not just about kink, it’s about building a life with a dominant husband.

Requirements:

Age: 28–55

Proper grammar & respectful intro (please no AI-style, keep it real.)

Distance isn’t a dealbreaker (I’m open to anywhere), but clarity of intention, emotional intelligence, and a nurturing nature are non-negotiable

1mx3cio,https://www.reddit.com/r/wolfalice/comments/1mx3cio/absolutely_beautiful_album/,Absolutely beautiful album!!,"I made myself some good coffee and sat there for 40 minutes listening to the album. I was really looking forward to this and it didn’t disappoint. Absolutely beautiful work.



I couldn’t help but smile seeing how well I already knew Bloom Baby Bloom, White Horses, and The Sofa. So when they came up I understood them so much better and was more open to receiving what the songs were doing.



I have such a special connection to each of their previous albums, like most of you do, so although I don’t totally agree, I understand where some of the resistance and slight disappointment might be coming from for this one. 



Personally, each of their albums do something so unique for me that I have to go to that album to be able to have that particular experience ever again. Like, no other album or music really does what Visions of a Life, My Love is Cool, and Blue Weekend each uniquely and individually do for me. I’m not even sure if Wolf Alice themselves can recreate something similar to any of their albums again in a way that delivers the exact same emotions and experience. This is something I both appreciate and grieve (heavily). I appreciate it because, even years later, when I go back and listen to those albums it’s an incredible musical and emotional journey, and it feels like I’m listening to something unearthly. But it’s also so sad because when I listen to something else, it’s just not *that* album. 



So my expectation is that The Clearing will also carve out its own space in my life uniquely and won’t share that space with any other album or work, whether by Wolf Alice’s or anyone else. I can’t wait to see how much I will see, create, and live while listening to this album. 



Congrats to Wolf Alice, such creative people and true artists. I’m glad that they are staying true to themselves and creating something so unique every time. And happy album day to the fans who are celebrating xx",9,1755860344.0,wolfalice,3,1.0,False

Of course I just want it numb, and if I don't actively restrict, I will just eat non stop. I need to scare myself by looking at calories and tell myself over and over to divert the rages to eat elsewhere etc but still, I have it where I am absolutely shocked senseless and in absolute disbelief when I realize how much I am actually eating during a day. Like, I will have 1000 thoughts occupiyng me and I totally forget weighing everything, tracking it all, sitting urges out etc...it can be 4-6000cal a day if I go by feeling and appetite, like, 12 Muffins, a 500g bag oats  or a whole loaf of bread with 3-4 packs of cheese and sausage etc. the calories are through the ROOF to a point where it becomes self harm that is how much I will eat, uncontrollably until I am nauseous and forced to stop my acid reflux mid-bite. It is not even on a human scale anymore, homo sapiens does not eat like this. Farm animals do, from the troth. I don't get why my brain defaults to this on some days and it is nearly impossible to NOT do that!!!!!

But when I am relaxed...I just have normal meals!!!! Normal food in safe amounts!!!!

# Chapter 3: Arrival

I’d woken up to another request to have George transferred, and shot it down out of hand. I said that the only acceptable replacements would be Hex and Binary, if ever they reappeared.

I needed half the fronts controlled by people I knew just to have the peace of mind to let me continue operations.

Then I put in a request for a cover story so I could slip over the border and join a strike and monitor George’s strikes personally. Let them chew on that!

By the time I’d finished brushing my teeth the little portable radio chattered a coded negative, with no further explanation before going dark, beyond another demand for George to be relieved as commander. I sent out a confirmation of receipt so they wouldn’t have to repeat the broadcast, but otherwise didn’t answer.

I could threaten to go over the border unprompted, meet with George and take local command, let them scramble to keep my cover intact, but that felt like forcing their hand to do something and every book I’d ever read on the topic suggested that with the CIA that was a terrible, terrible idea.

The truth is, I didn’t have the leverage here. Hopefully we’d find a way to come to an agreement. Promoting an already-present small-time field insurgency to running the coordinated strikes in New York had worked well there, though Gavin and Sullivan wouldn’t say whether Jester was one of theirs or not. What they did say was that they’d rotated her out last week and elected to replace her with one of their chosen. From the reports I reviewed, an enormous chunk of the original cell had gone dark, including the field commander they’d trained and sent up, with circumstances muddled and unclear. Likely dead, in other words. Either way, not a stellar track record on their end, either.

Trust was earned and built, and so far neither of us were delivering the expected or hoped-for results.

*****

## Arrival

It had been a few days since arrival, and Cre’sin had settled in nicely. A few sparsely attended public speaking tours covered nationally with selective camera angles, a couple deradicalization outreach centers opened, and it wasn’t long before she was receiving a few pieces of art stylized after her during her patronage visits to the arts district.

Amilita decided, then, that it was time. With a knock on the door and a smile, she invited the Governess out over the border.

“There’s someone I want you to meet.”

“It’s not Emperor, is it?” The governess asked, expression suddenly nervous.

“No,” Amilita laughed as she called the impounded luxury cruiser to the private launchpad.

“Good, good, I was worried that you and he had become friendly or something.”

“Goddess, no!” Disgusting. She couldn’t wait for her husband to come, and she was already grateful to the Governess for proposing it.

“So who is it?” She asked as the car zipped across the skies toward the Northern Wilmington exurbs.

“Someone who was instrumental in helping me realize what was going on with humanity here. He has valuable insights.”

The Governess tapped at where the window met the transparent door panel and then correctly guessed.

“How’d you know?” Amilita laughed at being figured out.

“When I mentioned to my family which state I was going to, one of my daughters showed me the short holoflicks she had gathered from Earth, some of the only ones cleared for broad distribution. They helped familiarize me with the state I’d be governing. If you’re showing me around, then it’s not an unreasonable assumption.”

Right. Of course.

The General checked her omni-pad for the third time, and got a confirmation from the Marine she’d posted on the front lawn, then sent the ‘clear’ order as they drew near. She’d dropped by to visit Elias plenty of times, but there was always the chance, no matter how remote, that…what was it again that they said about tigers? ‘Once they had the taste for human flesh they had to be put down,’ right? The local language had no handy idioms about Emperors and sinking their metaphorical fangs into Governesses, but ‘better safe than sorry.’

As planned, the front driveway was clear, and Elias Sampson waved from the front stoop, his mother by his shoulder. She scanned for the rest of the family- after all the hard work she’d put in reunifying them, she’d hoped to deliver the stereotypical ‘complete picture,’ but they were absent.

“My father said he had to take my sister to do some shopping when I told him you were coming through. She’s only arrived home recently, so I guess some things were left behind in New York.”

Noticing her expression, Elias had addressed her concern immediately as a greeting, then met her with a quick hug. Of course he knew the game without her even needing to tell him, displaying a familiarity and kindness. She’d scared the hell out of Cre’sin, then given her a taste of what human food and nature could be. Now it was time to show the real inroads she’d made with the locals.

Amilita patted him on the back and he let go of the hug, then she offered a handshake that all but swallowed the tiny mother’s hand while Elias greeted the visiting Noblewoman in High Shil.

“Good afternoon to you,” he said respectfully, politely offering a fist bump, whereas Emperor always insisted on a handshake. “My apologies, news travels slowly, but I don’t believe we are acquainted.” His eyes fixed on her laminated pass, one that had been given to the Governess by Emperor and colored Red. They were to be handed out ‘in the event of emergency requirement,’ where someone who outranked even Amilita had come, and where saying ‘no’ wasn’t an option. A close eye was to be kept on such people, Emperor had said, and sure enough her Militia arrived shortly after, blocking the road off.

“Excuse me a moment,” Amilita said, starting off for the Militia, leaving the three to become acquainted. She was careful to not tromp across the strange leafed plant that contained the short grass, and took the long way. The Militiawoman barking out orders was ignoring Amilita. Sure enough, a junior Militiawoman jumped in her way, trying to deflect her- only to bounce off Amilita as the solid General maintained her approach without even acknowledging the impact.

“Militiawoman,” Amilita greeted her, only for the Militia captain to whirl in place.

“What?” It was a question and a challenge.

“Calm down, Fido,” Amilita said. She’d spent enough time around Morsh to recognize a truly dangerous individual, versus someone dressed in too much equipment to be practical. All for show.

“My name’s not-”

“I don’t care,” Amilita cut the Militia Commander off. She’d learned the painful lesson of being too polite with uncooperative underlings and swore to herself she’d never let it happen again.

“I’m going to make some things clear to you. If you screw up this peace, my entire base will rip you apart. My guns will blast you out of the sky before you make it to orbit. And when we catch the survivors, and we will, we will bind you up and hurl you over the perimeter to let the insurgents do whatever they want to you. I hear they’re fond of vivisections and cannibalism, sometimes at the same time. There won’t be any extraction from this base for any of you, are we clear?”

The Bodyguard, almost as tall and broad as Amilita, swallowed. She started looking between Governess Cre’sin in the distance and Amilita, and a waiting human car before taking a small step back and waving the Militiawoman to the side of the road, letting the vehicle pass with its characteristic rumble with a glare at its occupant as if her being dressed down was all somehow his fault.

A road closure would be a small nuisance. But General Amilita had learned how small nuisances added up to general outrage, and she wanted to get that as clear and out of the way as possible. Amilita came back up the driveway just in time to hear the latest exchange.

“May I ask what you sought in applying to be Governess?” Elias asked. It was a sensitive topic, of course. Her being paid to manage the access to one of the planet’s most desirable and exclusive zones was a given, so he may as well have asked: Are you chasing clout, or do you just want an exciting fling with a local? The former’s going to make you a problem. The latter’s annoying, but manageable. Still, he’d managed it with an acceptable level of tact.

Of course, the Governess saw right through the question and fixed Amilita with a slight smile. “Are all humans this precocious?” She leaned down slightly- and seemed to almost surprise herself with how little she needed to stoop to look him right in those bright green eyes.

“I wish they were all so honest, but no, they often layer their meanings.”

“They also don’t enjoy being spoken about as if they’re not right in front of you,” the boy commented with that adorably outdated accent from the old holoflicks that had come pre-loaded on the omni-pads when they were dragged out of the storage unit. Now that she looked him over, it almost pained her to admit that he wouldn't be a boy for much longer, hardly a few more months, really.

If he were a Pesrin, his tail would be twirling in agitation, claws experimentally unsheathing. Short of saying: Make it to six months, I might bother being friendly with you. Until then, you’re just passing through. He was unusually testy, but seemed to genuinely want to know as much about the new Governess as possible. At least his curiosity and interest were positives, surely.

To Amilita’s pleasant surprise, the noblewoman actually apologized. “My apologies, I meant no harm.” And similarly, Elias met her with a genuinely warm smile after taking a moment to consider her words.

“No harm done, no need for a duel!” He joked, borrowing the old expression as naturally as it was one of his own. “Welcome to Earth. Now, I think Mother has prepared some food, if you haven’t eaten already?” Then he said something to the same effect to his Mom, who brightened at being at last looped into the conversation and given something to do.

*****

I finished cleaning in the kitchen with my mother, who was a little put off that apparently our extraterrestrial guests had eaten just before coming by. I frowned at the word I’d mentally chosen- ‘extraterrestrial.’ It made me think of little grey men possessed of vigor, not amazonian space aliens.

“Was it something I said?” Mother asked for the fifth time. I knew better than to suggest that it was anything I’d done, if I wanted to avoid being impotently grounded for the rest of my life. Still, I frowned.

Overall, everything had actually gone well, until the two had exchanged a glance at the omni-pad and then hustled out of the house, the Governess still doing the niceties while Amilita practically dragged her away by her elbow, the Militia swarming around them, eyes darting skyward on a perfectly clear summer day.

I wandered over to where we’d been sitting and checked my omni-pads. It would be suspicious if the one I’d been gifted by Natalie, connected to the aliens’ DataNet, read some alert and the human ones didn’t. But no, neither had anything on their displays. Fingers flying, I texted Natalie first.
 

* Is something going on?
 

Then I sent out an alert to the Delaware insurgency via the relay: Elevate local warning level for next 8 hours , before switching to my cell phone. No new messages from Gavin and Sullivan, Sam, or any of the commanders, no missed calls from unknown numbers.

I flicked on the little portable radio I’d been given as a going-away present, already tuned to the broadcast band. Nothing coming in about anything to be cautious of.

* No, why?

* Amilita and the Governess stopped by, and then left very quickly. I’m sure it’s nothing, but it seemed odd.
  
No news was good news.

I reviewed everything said during their visit again, and still couldn’t come up with anything that we’d done wrong. For now it might just serve as a reminder that for as fast as we were growing, our revolution was still a blip on the surface of Earth. Whatever might be happening in the galaxy, or even as relatively close on the far side of the planet, was frankly not yet our business and should not concern me.

I took a deep breath in and reluctantly let go of each of the electronic devices, letting each fall onto the couch cushion through my splayed hands, and let out the tension. I had to rely on a certain historical figure for wisdom, here.

*You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and find your strength.*

There.

I didn’t need all of these right now. Frankly, I was getting neurotic just hanging on to them.

Then I glimpsed down at the omni-pad. If anything involving the shil’vati were to happen, I was sure Natalie would be the first to know about it, and equally certain she’d tell me if it was important. Maybe it was best I left Mother to calm herself down, without being around for her to blame for our guest’s sudden decision to depart. I tried paging through a few notes before feeling her anxiety in the form of hurried footsteps back and forth, up and down the stairs and through the hall as she sought some outlet.

It occurred to me that for the first time in a while that almost everyone I’d seen today was a woman. Authority figures in my life as Elias had overwhelmingly been female, too, now that I thought about it. While that was to be expected from the Shil’vati, it extended to humanity as well. Principal Silver, most of my teachers at Talay, to Dr. Harriet and the nurses at the hospital, endless administrators and daycare. Even at home, now that I paused to think about it.

My father was usually passing out by dinner time. Mother, by contrast, was rather overactive in guiding my life. She seemed determined to be, since she couldn’t hen-peck a husband who was too plastered to even know what was even going on and vastly overmatched her physically, meaning any notion of disciplining him was a hilarious impossibility. Until recently, I could employ neither of those strategies as either a shield or as a way to force her to back off when she crossed lines, though. I’d hidden away by engaging myself with my books which seemed to be the only time she’d ever leave me be. Otherwise, every slight misstep, every failure to live up to her standard, was criticized. Even my own thoughts were dissected, until she broke them down until I confessed that I didn’t know something, and she left me with a final, sneering ‘well, that’s not good enough.’

Jacqueline, who I similarly avoided at all costs, could always overpower me and sought someone to take all her frustrations of life out on. I’d learned to be out of the house early and often, hidden in places she wouldn’t find me.

The combination of this avoidance and running away from problems I could never fight led to frequently finding myself reading books by daylight alone in the forest that butted up against both St. Michael’s and my neighborhood. Now, I no longer needed to run away and hide. Over the last year, I learned I could lay traps and attack back. Then I learned I could launch strikes, stand on my own, and even go on the offensive. Now, I could stand up to my sister. Now, I could even stand up to my mother. Could. Yet, how would it benefit me to do so? I had more strength than I’d ever had before, yet ever using it seemed wrong. Bar the permission of my parents, which…now that I thought about it, was odd. Why had they let me beat Jacqueline up? Was I their messenger- ‘straighten out, fly level, or else we’ll treat you like we treated him?’ No, that couldn’t be it, Father had just taken Jacqueline out today shopping. The lack of an answer frustrated me.

Furthermore, what was the point of strength if it could never be used except when approved of by others?

When I was a child, Jacqueline and her violence intrigued my curiosity. Often, I’d ask myself: Why ? Why was she acting that way? What had I ever done to deserve the lumps she’d lay on me? Was it perhaps a loathing of a much weaker younger brother? Certainly, puberty had rectified that, weightlifting and training rounding out for what that alone might have left vulnerable, and yet for all the pecking order had been altered, all I’d accomplished was greatly upsetting her.

My weakness wasn’t what had irked her, then, else the display of strength and power from our fight, and my challenging her status would have sparked a smile and acceptance that I’d finally risen, rather than all the snarling expression and feints in the hallway whenever we passed each other. So, what was it? And why had I even thought that it had been my physical weakness that had angered her so much?

Here I found the truth: Whatever she hated about me, it wasn’t weakness, dishonesty, or cowardice. Those were traits I loathed in my fellow man, seeing them in myself as a boy unable to fight back and forced to lie, and then I’d transposed that value system onto Jacqueline, because it was how I made sense of her. Now I found that it wasn’t the reason, I felt adrift.

Cycles of abuse were things I’d read about. I’d warned myself to mind my behavior, and imagined that because I was kind to the inner circle, and even to our hostages, that I had escaped it. Sycophants who bent the knee to our invaders had received a special double-serving of vengeance during my reign of terror on the state. I’d poured boiling tar down their throats for their lack of moral fiber and for turning on their more stalwart colleagues. I’d mocked another after having had her father killed for his cowardice. I’d strapped a bomb tied to a loyalist talk show radio DJ and had him drive to their gate just to deliver a message.

‘Why wait to have children to abuse, when I could lash out at these disappointments of humanity instead?’

For a moment, I felt like the lowest of the low. My motivations as Emperor were the subject of hot debate, not aided in the least by conflicting recruitment and propaganda videos we routinely put out to broaden the net of recruits.

The dissolution of our society and culture, and the way we seemed to surrender it in the name of senseless hedonism had been something I sensed, but could not name at the time I’d first agreed to set the bomb with Vaughn. Even later, when I sensed those, I knew my picture was incomplete, impossible to put into words.

As I understood more and more about the enemy, and what they had done to us, my list of motivations grew larger and more complex, but no less intense. They encompassed what the shil’vati, and their sycophants had taken from everyone, including the last of any innocence I had in the form and my first ever act of seduction being tied to murdering her. How many boys were lost among the stars? How many books burned and replaced? How many man-hours of labor to transcribe and pass on our traditions, erased? Good causes, all, and at last I had felt like I had a complete and good reason for doing what I did. I could make peace with my conscience.

But that hadn’t been my first impulse, had it? Initially, I had been driven by a hatred of hypocrisy and moral weakness.

I must never have children. Not until I can tackle the monster inside me that bays for blood without cause, and to inflict suffering without purpose.

How to go about that? What did most people do? Would that work for me?

The point of a confessional made a lot more sense, suddenly, than it had a couple years ago. After all, if I just confessed everything to Doctor Harriet, she’d be legally obligated to run to the police. I’d never live another day free. I wondered about the trivialities that people must confess to a standard therapist- they must be minor, or else I imagined a cop car would be parked outside every therapist’s office, though there was the very real chance I was just extremely fucked up. Who could I speak to about all this, even? Could I find forgiveness?

Certainly, with the Brothers’ enmity toward the aliens, perhaps they might not even see what I’d done as sinful. The idea of attending confession and letting it all out, frankly sounded amazing.

No, you’re just offloading your own moral decision-making to a different rubric, letting someone else judge you and claiming that judgment as divine so you don’t dare question it. What alternatives did you have? To do nothing as they ripped away everything that made you human? Is that somehow any more moral, or less? You already know the answer.

I still missed Larry. I missed Verns. I missed G-Man, Radio, and the Twins, too. Even Vaughn. I could just… talk to them. About either, or both sides of my life. I hadn’t been able to even bring myself to bike past Larry’s mechanic’s garage, and on my first pass through the neighborhood I had found myself just standing outside his unlit house, unable to move or say anything for a half hour. I’d known death, introducing it to so many others in the pursuit of greater autonomy for humanity, and the preservation of our culture. Now I knew loss, too. Was I innocent, not knowing what I inflicted onto others? Then again, could they even know such loss without any connection to others, in a way that formed a society and civilization? They certainly seemed okay with me losing mine, one way or another. Was that justice, retribution?

Then another thought entered my mind, whispering in my ear unbidden: If you attended confessional and the Brothers approved, you might even start organizing through St. Michael’s. The private school had wealthy connections, and arrangements could be made through them. They would know who among them truly sympathizes with the aliens, and who among them hates.

Then again, what if the brother didn’t exactly approve and ran to the cops? What then? Faith was one thing, a sackful of silver denarii was another. Silencing wouldn’t be just optional, it would have to be done. The blood of a teacher on my hands, and a Brother at that? I’d even weighed the odds of getting away with the act before considering the moral atrocity of it all. That I even considered it… I shuddered.

Vaughn had more of an effect on me than I’d realized. Or had Vaughn just seen something in me? More than a lonely boy he could use to his own ends, that is. The thought made me shudder.

Shudder all you want, it’s a pretense. You know what you are. You’re responsible for countless deaths. You’ve slipped into a home and murdered an old crone for her crimes. You fought on that hill, shooting and stabbing until it was nothing more than a crater. You’re a killer, Elias Sampson. Make your peace with that, or else lock yourself away and be scared of what you’re capable of. If all killing was bad, we would have few heroes. No Perseus, no Hercules, no Agamemnon. No Alexander, no Cromwell, no Bowie.

I tapped the reassuring weight of the omni-pad. Natalie had found it in herself to weigh all this after I’d told her. It hadn’t been fear that had motivated her to stop the bombardment of my fortress, but love. She’d come and looked for me, rescued me. Perhaps that was again offloading moral judgment, but how could I doubt the one I loved, when love was built on trust?

I couldn’t beg for the forgiveness of others, unless I was ashamed. If I was unashamed, then I’d have to accept myself as I was, uncritically.

Yes, I’d killed the sycophants, the aliens, the traitors. Doubtless, more of them would die with every passing day. I’d led good men to their deaths, and more still would have to give their lives. How many good men had died in my company? I’d made myself through books, but had been shaped by women, moulded by them, hadn’t I?

My mind stumbled over a detail, finally finding exceptions to my theory of upbringing and being shaped by women. The books I’d chosen had been written by men great and wise, and my once and future school was the other main exception. The Brothers of the faith ran and taught there, though it was a faith I had little to no part of. The student body was all boys, too. Maybe it was the concept of an all-knowing man in the sky that was my hang-up, some [‘god of the gaps,’ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)his domain an ever shrinking one as the gaps in our knowledge of the world around us evaporated under scrutiny, coupled to resentment of my own semi-absent father making it hard to relate. Perhaps it was an overfamiliarity with being raised by a mother who, with father snoozing in the chair and wanting just to be left alone, had no checks on her power over me, and whose authority and rule did not resemble that of a man’s. Associating with the families in the bible felt like somewhat of a stretch, a mirror of seeing those happy, smiling, peaceful families on TV and in movies, or even in some of the books I’d read which were no less alien to me than the Shil’vati.

It had taken me experience outside the family to understand, at last, what I’d been missing. Well, ‘Missing’ implied that if it came through our front door, that I’d want or even accept it. My family, imperfect to so many as it was, was at least familiar. If Jacqueline and Father came home tonight as peaceful and sober at the dinner table tonight, and I came back to the house to find mother capable of respecting boundaries, I wasn’t sure I could accept that the mind wiper hadn’t gotten to them. Even if ‘Missing’ wasn’t the right word, I could think of no other.

My family had as much made me, and enabled me to do all the things I could, where no other had done. If ever my identity and story was discovered, I was certain that people would fervently wish my family situation had been different, albeit the reasons would vary. Some would wish my upbringing changed for my personal sake, but would hold back from actually wishing for interference for fear of losing what had made me as Emperor, leader of the insurgency. Others would gleefully change to prevent the rise of Emperor, with my life as Elias left only as an afterthought, a bonus for their faux morality. Which did I prefer?  
  
Neither.  
  
I supposed I found myself back at that old walnut after all- Elias vs. Emperor. No, I’d settled that I was who I was. Elias and Emperor were one and the same to me, no matter how most of the rest of the galaxy saw it. I wondered if some of the investigators rejected the idea that Emperor really was just one person the whole time. Well, two, if anyone counts Vaughn’s brief stint nonconsensually moonlighting the role.

Despite what underground papers might suggest, I was not a representation assembled of multiple people as some avatar of their outrage, nor a divine trinity of Elias, Emperor, and Vaughn, and definitely not God. Whatever way anyone chose to slice it, Memento Mori.

I am a man, a mortal, and someday I too will die.

God couldn’t die, right? Except, Nietzsche claimed the opposite. [“God is Dead!” ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead)He famously proclaimed. Was there anything to that? I’d never really explored the writings, only the famed quote and a Reader’s Digest level of surface analysis. Certainly he hadn’t meant it as: ‘Jesus was God, and then God died on the cross.’ There was a whole sect that the Catholics at St. Michael’s would regard as a form of heresy, right?  What was it called again? Arianism? Or did I have it backwards?

The subject matter I loved now conflicted with the subject matter I spent so much time avoiding.

Perhaps I’d been stupid to ever blindly accept that the anthropomorphization of God was one of the many demands placed on believers by the church. It just seemed to be so, after the many times he was portrayed in modern culture. I’d never noticed how that seemed at-odds with what scant bits I bothered to actually pay attention to in class, usually in the first or last couple minutes. Perhaps viewing God that way helped some people, and so the church did not want to dissuade it, but certainly it had done a number on me. If I explained this to the Brothers there and started pelting them with these questions, showing a sudden curiosity in the subject matter I’d previously aggressively avoided while attending would help integrate me back into St. Michael’s, demonstrate some reform that would make my presence more palatable.

There was really only one way to find out. I’d start there, see how they regarded the shil’vati, and test the waters. Rome wasn’t built in a day, after all.

Thus resolved with a destination in mind at least, I looked back at the small scattering of devices on the couch before declining to take any along. If whatever had pulled our guests away had concerned me in any way, then surely Amilita would have said so. Especially if Natalie still didn’t know by now.

If I brought a private omni-pad, then the Catholic brothers might take some offense. Certainly the church, among other religions, were a smidge upset over the whole ‘no more tax exempt status.’

Though moral concerns were still buzzing around my mind like a swarm of bees, I still found it in me to sound somewhat upbeat. “See ya mom!” I called out and then pulled the door shut behind me, feeling light on my feet without my usual bag weighing me down.

How had I forgotten that I’d gone out of my way to make trouble for them in some misguided attempt at revenge by breaking in with Radio?

I kicked myself for the umpteenth time - one could walk through the woods from Camp Death, though it would take time, and eventually arrive at Saint Michael’s. ‘Don’t Shit Where You Eat.’ I’d utterly ignored my own advice out of some desire for petty revenge in a place I’d now be attending. Though I doubted anyone would actually go trace the unmapped woodland paths that connected to all the different potential neighborhoods, some of which had since been cleared, it wasn’t exactly holding to my rules. Given the school was doing a fresh intake with the new year, I doubted any serious reprisal had followed.

I hoped the school hadn’t changed again since I’d last been there. Before school had closed for the year during the invasion, we’d all been made fervent patriots. Then when it resumed, within the span of a few weeks they were singing the aliens’ praises, professing that they’d been loyal to them the whole time. If I walked in and found them fawning over the Coalition or something, I was going to be livid.  

Still, all distant signs I’d had just by chance of passing through over the last year showed little change- did a failure of effect count for absolution and wash me of my ill-intentions? Of course not. So, how could I make it up to them? Well, there was no way to know by not going. I picked up my pace slightly, hugging the grass through the final blind corner just before the giant parking lot that served as the recess playground. My heart sang as the familiarity took hold- I was only missing the heavy backpack full of textbooks and slightly uncomfortable uniform to really make it all slot together. Hopefully Brother Thomas or Edward would be there to answer my questions.

I looked both ways, and started to cross when a familiar older model black sedan careened around the blind corner, tires squealing as the driver slammed brakes. I leaped back onto my side of the street, only for a familiar face behind a pair of aviators to poke out from the rolled down window. “Get in!” Barked Sullivan, in a tone that brooked no backtalk or further debate.

My feet were already in motion by the time I thought to comply.

Hello everyone, good to see you. The next chapter's just about ready to go, albeit a bit short. I went over the limit on this one, so I'm going to be splitting it in half, and 'working ahead' a bit, as there's a bit of a murky grey area for 'how to get to the next part.' Plus, I'm moving to somewhere a bit larger which'll have more square footage for the baby, so that's going to be fun, then prepping for a Baby Shower.

They take *real, big bites*, and still keep delivering dialogue just as naturally. Same with drinking. Contrast that with Western shows...unconvincing fake sips from obviously empty coffee cups, barely-touched meals, or “eating” scenes where food is just pushed around on the plate, or on someones's fork while they talk. Or the scene conveniently starts right at the end of a meal so they have supposedly just finished eating... Rarely do you see long, realistic meal scenes like in K-dramas.

So I’m curious:

* Do Korean acting schools specifically train this skill in a way western ones don't?
* Is it more about cultural norms/experience, with eating scenes being such a staple in K-dramas that actors just get used to multitasking food and dialogue really well?
* Also, how do they do it considering most scenes take several takes? They must be so stuffed downing so many huge bites over and over... Do they schedule eating scenes during actual lunch time so the actors simply show up really hungry and what they eat during the takes is their actual lunch?
* I’ve heard the reason Western productions use empty cups is that liquid messes with sound quality during dialogue. But if that’s true, why doesn’t it seem to be an issue in K-dramas? They’re constantly eating and drinking on camera without issues, it seems.",6,1755859408.0,kdramas,2,1.0,False

A batch of 2024 passout here. 

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.


 
2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.


  
3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.



4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. 



5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay



6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. 
  


7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  
 



8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".
 


9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria. 
  


10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. 



11. About s*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we'd get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s*x, you'll realise that casual s*x is not what you want. S*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.  
 


12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH*T WHERE YOU EAT.   



13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. 
 


14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don't over abuse it. Alcohol fu*ks you up by fu*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to. 




15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.




16. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  
 


17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. 
  


18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.



19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. 



20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.  



21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I'm a completely different person than what I was when I joined. 



Finally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad maje karo. You'll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or 
more out of money, time, energy). 
All the very best 💯❤️💞🧿




P.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions   


Addition 1: Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I'll say it again. Don't dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn't get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good. 

Addition 2: Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you'll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. 

Addition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. 
 


Addition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. 

Addition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure. 

P.S: **I'll soon do another ""2 cents"" post for all CAT and OMET aspirants here related to exam and gdpi prep. I actually wrote this ""2 cents"" for the ones who've or will convert a BSchool and join this year, but I'm amazed at how such kind of a post also ended up giving some motivation to those who are yet to give CAT and OMETs.**

Also, thank you for showing so much love to the post. I hope this inspires you all to work hard and get into the best BSchools :) ❤️💞

What’s the appropriate gift for a 130th anniversary? Perhaps a Boston Post Cane ceremony?


That’s the plan for this year’s installment of Warwick Old Home Days, when the ebony wood-crafted cane that was once distributed by the now-defunct Boston Post newspaper to be given to each municipality’s oldest resident will be presented to the family of Virginia Fellows. It’s one of the festivities planned for the three-day event that dates back to 1895.


The Boston Post Cane ceremony will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday near the open mic area on the town common.


Town Coordinator David Young mentioned Old Home Days will also feature the return of the popular table read of “The Man Who Came to Dinner,” the Broadway play that was later made into a 1942 American screwball comedy film starring Bette Davis and Jimmy Durante. The table read is planned for Friday, Aug. 22, at 7 p.m. at Town Hall, representing the sole Friday event for Old Home Days. It will be the Warwick Readers Theater’s third production.


Some returning events, such as the Fire Department’s cookout and the festivities on the town beach, are also planned.


“My favorite things would be the firemen’s cookout on Saturday afternoon on the common, and on Sunday, the boat parade down on the town beach,” commented Andrea Woods, who is organizing the church supper set for Saturday. “The boat parade is a lot of fun.


“And we’re expecting great weather,” Woods added. “It does really bring back a lot of people that used to live here. They love to come back, see their old home.”

hey Philly, so if you're trying to make some extra cash i put together a list of some side hustles that actually work here. i'm skipping some of the obvious stuff and trying to give you some real ideas.  
  
1. Work the Convention Center. bet you didn't think of this one. check craigslist under the 'gigs' section and search for the pennsylvania convention center. companies need people for a few hours or a few days to be brand ambassadors, help with sales, or just demonstrate products. not gonna lie the pay can be pretty decent money, sometimes like $20 an hour or a flat rate for the event.  
  
2. Mystery Shop at Breweries. yeah you can get paid to drink beer. a company called secret hopper pays you to go to local breweries and review your experience. with all the breweries in fishtown and beyond, this one is honestly pretty fun and easy if you're into craft beer.  
  
3. Rent out your parking spot. this is a genius one for philly. if you have a driveway, garage, or even just a dedicated spot, you can rent it out on this app called Prked. parking is a total nightmare here, especially in south philly or near center city. you could rent your spot out for games at the linc or wells fargo center for short-term cash. or, even better, rent it monthly. tons of people in neighborhoods with tight street parking would pay good money for a guaranteed spot. it's passive income and you could probably make a couple hundred bucks a month in Philadelphia doing nothing.  
  
4. Become a Chess Tutor. sounds random i know, but i saw a listing for this and it makes sense. lots of parents want their kids to have extracurriculars that aren't sports. if you're good at chess, you could make some serious cash on the side.  
  
5. Sell stuff at a flea market. philly has a big thrift and vintage scene. you could spend your weekends hitting up goodwill outlets or neighborhood thrift stores and then sell your finds at one of the local flea markets. it takes some work but the profit can be huge if you have a good eye.  
  
6. Event Staffing. beyond the convention center, there's always something happening in the city. companies like shiftgig connect you with one-off shifts for concerts, festivals, and sporting events. it's flexible and you get to be part of some cool philly events.  
  
7. Food Delivery in the right spots. okay this one is more common, but the trick is to work smart. stick to areas where parking is impossible and people order in a lot, like center city, south philly, or around temple university. you'll get more deliveries faster and won't waste as much time driving around. bike delivery is clutch in these areas.  
  
8. Dog Walking. simple but always in demand. with so many people living in apartments and row homes, there's a constant need for people to walk their dogs during the workday. you can build up a regular client base in your own neighborhood.  
  
9. Part-time Barista. this is a solid gig especially if you live near one of the universities. the pay is usually above minimum wage, often around $15 an hour plus tips. coffee shops are always looking for people with flexible hours.  
  
10. Caregiving. there are a lot of opportunities for part-time caregivers, and you don't always need a certification for companion-type roles. websites can connect you with families who need help with elderly relatives for a few hours a week.  
  
hope this helps someone out. philly has a lot of opportunities if you know where to look.",1,1755858874.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False
1mx2vz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/1mx2vz8/ngo_marketing_strategy/,NGO marketing strategy?,"One day (in 2024) a girl from an NGO stopped me in the street (I want to keep her privacy so I'll call her Sophie, fictional name). She came running towards me and she matched the beauty standards in general terms. We had this conversation:

""Hey, hi, I’m Sophie, let me tell you something, it’s just a minute. This is an NGO to send peanut butter to poor kids who are in an extreme state of malnutrition and can’t eat anything else. I explained it well, didn’t I?""

""Yes.""

""Since I explained it so well, can you give me your phone number so that when they call you from my job you give me a good score? It helps me to keep my job.""

""If it’s just that, okay, but I don’t want to donate.""

""You don’t need to donate for this, give me your phone number.""

I gave it to her and we kept talking.
""Are you a teacher?""

""No.""

""A doctor?""

""No, biologist.""

""Guess what I study, it starts with A.""

I didn’t guess. She was in her second year of architecture.

""How old are you?""

""37.""

""Wow, you look much younger! Now guess my age.""

""19.""

""First try!""

""It’s just that you said you were in second year of university. That was a good clue.""

""I’ll invite you for a coffee one of these days. Give me your address, email…"" (she carried a form from the NGO and wanted to write it there).

""I told you I’m not going to donate.""

""It’s only for the call, I need it for my job.""

I gave her the data. Then she continued:

""And your bank account?""

""I said I’m not going to donate.""

""I need you to sign up so that they count it for me at work, but you can sign up that you start donating in October, cancel in September, and that way you don’t have to donate.""

I gave her the account. She continued:

""I’ll put you down that you donate 10€.""

""So, I have to donate.""

""Yes.""

""I’m not going to donate.""

""Come on, 10€ is what a coffee costs and I’m going to invite you for one…""

""I said no.""

""I told you at the beginning that you had to donate and you agreed.""

""You told me at first that I didn’t have to donate. Give me the sheet with my data because I don’t want to donate. My data is written and I don’t want it written.""

All this time she was nice and smiling. At that moment her face changed as if a bucket of cold water had fallen on her.

""Why?""

""Because it’s my data and I have my rights.""

""It’s just that if you sign up then I already covered the quota I need to recruit today and I can go home.""

""I don’t care. Give me the sheet. I wanted to help you but if I have to donate, no.""

Then she gave me the sheet visibly angry and told me:

""They don’t count it. Have a nice day.""

Right at the end, she switched to treating me formally in that last sentence. Since she gave me the sheet where she had written my data, these didn’t reach the NGO or anywhere.

That experience was really surprising for me because she tried me to turn me in a donor but in a heterodox way. Today, another girl of another NGO, stopped me in the street and tried to use the same strategy, but I told her I have a previous experience and I know she will finally ask me to donate even if she tells me there's no need at the beginning.

I am very surprised because I have seen 2 different persons from 2 different NGO doing the same. Is that a marketing strategy? If so, could you tell me more about it? Thanks",1,1755858784.0,AskMarketing,1,1.0,False

* **Antioxidánsok és polifenolok:** Legfőbbek a katechinek (zöld tea), flavonoidok és teaflavinok (fekete tea) [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-vs-tea?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/from-managing-blood-pressure-to-tackling-bad-cholesterol-7-teas-that-are-liquid-wonders/photostory/123342154.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Health](https://www.health.com/tea-vs-coffee-8659414?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Szív- és érrendszerre gyakorolt hatás:** A zöld tea csökkenti az LDL-koleszterint és enyhén a vérnyomást; fekete tea és egyéb fűszeres teák (hibiszkusz, oolong, gyömbér) szintén hozzájárulhatnak ehhez [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/from-managing-blood-pressure-to-tackling-bad-cholesterol-7-teas-that-are-liquid-wonders/photostory/123342154.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Élettartam és halálozás:** Két csésze tea naponta (főként fekete tea) 9–13 %-kal alacsonyabb halálozási kockázatot jelent [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/coffee-vs-tea-nutrition-health/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Egy ausztrál kutatás szerint a hosszútávú teafogyasztás 19 %-kal csökkenti a kardiovaszkuláris halálozást, és minden extra csésze 4 %-kal mérsékelheti a kockázatot [thescottishsun.co.uk](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/health/13071514/tea-heart-health-boost/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Emésztés és stressz:** Az L-theanin nyugodt, fókuszált tudatállapotot idézhet elő. A tea enyhébb energialöketet ad, megkímélve az idegrendszert [Health](https://www.health.com/tea-vs-coffee-8659414?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Real Simple](https://www.realsimple.com/coffee-or-tea-7253639?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Fogyás:** Zöld tea zsírvesztést és BMI-javulást segít elő (átlag -1,23 kg); emellett étvágycsökkentő hatása is van [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/green-tea-vs-black-coffee-what-is-better-for-weightloss/photostory/121893798.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Túlzott fogyasztás veszélyei:** A sok tannin gátolhatja a vasfelszívódást és irritálhatja a gyomor nyálkahártyáját. Koffeinérzékenység esetén GI panaszok jelentkezhetnek, valamint a bélflóra változhat [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/can-excessive-tea-effect-gut-health-in-the-long-run/articleshow/123386151.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

# 4. Kombinált fogyasztás: együtt még jobb

A UK Biobank (UK adatbázis) szerint az optimális kombináció napi <1–2 csésze kávé és 2–4 csésze tea: ez jelentősen csökkenti az összhalálozást (HR \~0,78), különösen a szív- és légzőszervi betegségek halálozását [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36397104/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

# 5. Globális fogyasztási trendek

* **Mennyiség és preferencia:** A világon kb. három csésze teát fogyasztanak kávéra jutó egyhez. Tea a második legnépszerűbb ital víz után [Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/tea-or-coffee-a-case-study-on-evidence-for-dietary-advice/7F3C25A5C0661CDB3BDD5A8FD15B258F?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/coffee-vs-tea-nutrition-health/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Szokások országonként:** Amerikában: kávéfogyasztók 53 %, teafogyasztók 46 %. Sok országban azonban a tea vezet, például Indiában, Törökországban, vagy Kínában [Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/34497/respondents-who-regularly-drink-tea-or-coffee/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Tim's Coffee](https://timscoffee.com/blog/statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Daisy Journals](https://www.daisyjournals.com/coffee-vs-tea-the-global-market-battle?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_tea_culture?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Specifikus adatok:** Törökországban évente kb. 2,5–3,2 kg tea fogy fejenként — a világ első számú per fő tea-fogyasztója [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_in_Turkey?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/1cbajxi?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Finnország viszont az egyik legkávé-élénkebb ország (átlag 4 csésze/nap), ahol munkahelyi szünetek is törvényileg előírtak [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/1cbajxi?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_in_Sweden?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

# Összegzés: kávé vagy tea — melyiket válasszuk?

|Szempont|Kávé|Tea|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Energia, éberség**|Gyorsabb, erőteljesebb|Lassan emelkedő, nyugodtabb|
|**Szív- és érrendszer**|Előnyös, de lehet vérnyomásprobléma|Erős antioxidáns, LDL-, vérnyomáscsökkentő|
|**Halálozás, krónikus betegségek**|Csökkenő rizikó (CVD, ráktípusok stb.)|Szintén csökkenő rizikó, főleg CVD és kognitív egészség|
|**Fogyás**|Anyagcsere-fokozás, étvágycsökkentés|Zsírégetés, kissé kevésbé hatékony|
|**Stressz, mentális állapot**|Kevésbé nyugtató, stimuláló|L-theanin: nyugalom + fókusz|
|**Mellékhatások**|Szorongás, alvásprobléma, magas vérnyomás|Tanninok-vas felszívódás, GI irritáció, koffeinérzékenység|

# Javaslat:

* Ha gyors energialöketre van szükséged — reggelekre vagy fizikai aktivitáshoz — **kávé** lehet a jobb választás.
* Ha stresszes napod van, vagy érzékeny a szervezeted a koffeinre, a **tea**, különösen a zöld tea, előnyösebb lehet.
* A legjobb hatás érdekében válaszd a **mértékletes kombinációt**: napi 1-2 csésze kávé + 2-4 csésze tea, amivel különösen kedvező hatások érhetők el [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36397104/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).",1,1755858629.0,megoszto,0,1.0,False
