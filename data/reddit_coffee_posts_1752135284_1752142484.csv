Anyway today a colleague came to ask me about some protocol at work (we are nurses) related to health quality markers and community health indicators. Quite long stuff to read.

I told her i had a summary table at chat gpt. Turned the computer screen so she could see it too, open chat gpt... And thats when i knew I F.U...

When i saw the word ""BDSM"" in a chat title. The night prior i had been updating my dating profile in an app and wasnt too inspired, so i asked the gpt for ideas.

I immediatly went to erase the chat and murmured ""Lets pretend you didnt see anything"", and she was like ""sure"". But my FU still had some more steps to go! Because just as i clicked the ""delete chat"" button, a doctor asked me for help finding something. Left my consultation, my colleague waiting for for me to return...

... and then i realized that the whole chat was open. Now it wasnt just the title, but the whole conversation she saw!

Good news is that she's quite chill, and when we were having a coffee I applogized for what she saw. To which she answeres: ""What chat are you talking about?"". Yeah, shes very cool, still... TIFU.

TL:DR: I opened chat gpt at work and a colleague saw a chat in which i asked for ideas for a pick up line, BDSM related. She's cool, I'm a bit embarrassed!",0,1752142070.0,tifu,1,0.25,False

– Feels tailored, even though it’s relaxed
– People complimented it without me saying a word

* There's a coffee shop on campus, I'm thinking no matter what, that's not a bad place to start
* A Bar Arcade is opening soon within a 12 minute walk (according to google maps) of campus. Is that a good place to bring someone on a first date? (i.e. getting coffee and walking to the barcade together)
* Alternatively, is a walk around campus just a better idea? There are a few picnic tables to sit and talk outside at
* There's a really good pizza place that is literally next door neighbors with one of our residential buildings, that's something I'm also thinking about.
* A study date is also an option, but I'm not sure I'd personally enjoy that as much as some of the other options I suggested, at least as a first date

1lw8vil,https://i.redd.it/p8anu1y2t0cf1.png,10 Tips for Those Just Starting to Write,"I. Make it a habit to have a small notebook with you wherever you are. Small thoughts and ideas can often get lost in the hustle and bustle, so it's a good practice to jot them down when they come to mind.





II. A subtle distinction exists between fiction and non-fiction. The entities you invent come to life, talk, and interact. What might be fiction for one could serve as a means of survival for another.





III. Be true to yourself. If your essence is that of a sweet and innocent soul, let yourself shine like a joyful sprite in the early morning. If you're a sick, disgusting, vessel carrying around spirits and ill hearted entities like some fleshy sack. Own that too. Embrace who you are.




IV. Locate your sanctuary. Always seek out a spot where you can find tranquility to write, whether it's a bench in the woods, a serene corner of a quaint coffee shop, a simple yet charming bookstore, or even inside the bowels of an old cremator in the deserted basement on Forest Avenue. Find your place of peace and make it yours.





V. Let go of seeking validation. Recognizing and valuing your own work is the most essential first step for any writer. Embrace who you are entirely and completely, and then things will naturally align. Focus on writing what you love. You will always have your audience, so there's no need to strive excessively and exhaust yourself.




VI. Keep the zip ties and duct tape close.




VI. Everything that is birthed bleeds.




VI. The dirt can't keep your secrets.




VII. No work of art can claim to be completely original. Many ideas have already been explored in different manners. Whether people want to accept it or not, everyone is impacted by the influence of others.




VIII. There's no strong insistence here, just some suggestions and thoughts. I believe that every writer should aspire to something greater than themselves. As imperfect beings, we can't navigate this journey of life alone. Even if our existence feels insignificant, even if we're just a walking corpse. We're just a walking corpse. We’re just a walking corpse. We're just a walking corpse…we still require a greater purpose to achieve true balance, clarity, and moderation. If you find it hard to believe in anything beyond our own existence, that greater influence can be a family member or a close friend.




IX. There's no need to feel embarrassed if you're unable to complete one piece of writing before starting another. This is completely normal; I bet even Mr. Poe had a collection of  scraps on his desk. Don't worry, just let your creativity flow, and you will return to that other piece in due time.




X. Dismiss this post, as it's more than likely that you have the entire cosmos and all of it's vast inhabitants under control.

Then on one random day i was scrolling through insta and came across this post that said "" Romanticize your life coz no one else is going to "" . Yeah it did sound a little cheeky at first but i dont know why it stuck with me and i went on to try it .
Next morning i put on my favorite music , lit up some candles while getting ready. I put on the outfit that i loved , made pasta and cold coffee for my lunch with extra chocolate syrup just because and went to college , stayed with my friends even after class , went out to eat and started taking everything slow . 
And for the first time in a long time i felt like the main character of my own life !!!
I kept going.
I made a playlist of songs that made me feel like I was in a movie.
I started noticing sunsets, and smiling at strangers.I wrote down little things I was grateful for each night.
I took myself on “dates” to bookstores, art galleries, parks.

The funny thing is, nothing big in my life has actually changed yet.But now, my life feels fuller.
I look forward to mornings.
I catch myself smiling for no reason.
And I don’t feel like I’m waiting for something magical to happen — because it already is, in the little ways.
Romanticizing my life didn’t fix everything, but it made me fall in love with being alive again.
And that’s enough.

Hello ladies. I'm having a bit of a crisis today and it will really help me if someone shares their own experiences or ""how to"" with me, please. Did anyone manage to find a new support system? If so, how? Really, how?? Because no matter what I try, nothing seems to work and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

I'm aware that being neurodivergent means you're different from NT and there will be some barriers or things that you just can't do the same way they do. But, if anyone has some advice on how to connect better with people in my environment, it will be super helpful.

* Regarding family:

I come from an abusive family and so having my family as a support system is out of the question, unfortunately. 

* Regarding coworkers:

I'm trying to find friends here but it feels like I'm doing something wrong (?) Nobody contacts me unless I do so. I'm trying to create fun plans for my coworkers, invite them for boardgames, bake something for them, ask them about their interests... And some of them will come if I invite them. But I can't help but feel like a huge burden. They never talk to me unless I engage first. Ever. Some of them don't meme me back or even answer. So I can't help but feel I'm annoying them. It doesn't matter if I wait 1 week or 3 until the next invite. It's always the same pattern.

That's the main issue. It's never reciprocated. I'm hardly ever invited. And it breaks my heart to hear them talking about other plans they do without me. 

I'm aware that they might just have their calendar full. They have partners, work, families etc. And it's not like they hate me in secret or anything. I don't think they're bad people. However, I can't help but notice they easily make new connections and group friends here (we're all living in another country) and I can't seem to be able to do the same.



* Regarding finding new friends:

This is complicated. There's a big language barrier because I'm living abroad and, while there are activities in English and I'm learning the local language, I don't seem to fit, no matter how much I try. I've tried a couple of different boardgame events and some new hobbies such as TCG. I usually go alone and do my best to engage with people there and have a nice time. Still... I feel very unwanted there. Usually, people there have a group of friends already made there and they'll talk about their DnD sessions or inside jokes I'm not a part of. Which is understandable, but still, not amazing as a newcomer. Also, some men there wait until nobody else can hear us to tell me how much they hate women or touch me without my consent. They keep making me uncomfortable and, at one point, I just stopped going.

I've had better luck online. I've been engaging in my fandoms a bit more recently. I've met wonderful people there I'd just like to be able to engage with someone over a coffee from time to time. Or to be able to talk about my daily issues and feel understood. So, any tip or new idea is more than welcome.",1,1752141071.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False
1lw8or8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1lw8or8/a_clinical_trial_broke_my_brain_and_now_my_wife/,A clinical trial broke my brain and now my wife is not my wife,"This morning, I pulled a tiny monitoring pin from my tooth — now, my wife is gone, and so is every trace of our life together.


I have to provide a tiny bit of context before I dive in; *stick with me.*
I'd lost both of my parents by high school graduation so when I was offered an out of state scholarship, I took it. Moved from Tennessee to Oklahoma and made real fast friends with the guy they roomed me with.


A week or two in, my friend let me know that he was about to earn $800 and get a free letter of recommendation for this clinical trial that he was gonna do. Well, I was broke and he also promised that this girl I had my eye on was taking part, too. I was obviously on board. 


It really wasn't even that memorable, the highlight was meeting *her.*
Lara was taking part in the trial too and we spent hours and hours in the waiting room sharing stories and getting close.
The only other memory I have of the trial was sitting for 2-3 hours once a week in a very grey room where I had to talk to a therapist type dude who asked a million questions covering every topic you can think of. 


If memory serves, I’m pretty sure that it had something to do with studying the processes that go into a person’s moral choices. It was purely therapist sessions, too. 
No needles or pills. It was easy. It was over after six weeks and my only symptoms at the end were a little extra pocket money and I’d grown completely attached to Lara. 


Other than using my small fortune to buy Lara a ring and a pretty white dress, nothing worth noting happened between finishing the trial and now. So, the real story starts about 3 weeks ago. 


On the second-to-last Friday in May, I got into an accident on my way home from work. Standard stuff, I got T-boned at an intersection, my car needed a new door and some internal stuff that insurance took care of but I was fine. Whiplash, but that comes with any accident.


Poor bastard in the car that hit me hadn't been wearing his seatbelt, though. Broke the windscreen with his own face. I saw the ambulance take him in a body bag. 


This is where I’m gonna lose you now and you’re gonna resign me to the cuckoos nest but please, stick with me. I'm not crazy. 


Three weeks later, we’re on the second Friday in June now, I'm on my way home from work in the shitty sedan my insurance set me up with while my car’s in the shop. 


Well, I'm honestly still a little on edge on this journey given the recent accident, I’m keeping an extra eye on the road and I get to the intersection where the poor dude T-boned me and I can see from my lane that *he* is fast approaching in the same car he died in three weeks ago. 


Hallucination? *Maybe, but it felt just as real as anything else.*


Just like last time, other drivers were honking and interacting with this dude ‘cos he’s moving way too fast for the speed limit and next thing I hear my radio tune out and then a voice. I know how this sounds. 


The radio said *“You don't have to make the same choice.”*


I don't know if I was subconsciously obeying the radio or if this would've been my course of action either way but I braked. Hard. He kept going and sped right past me this time, but he made sure his eyes met mine for just a second. It was him, it was his car. I don't know.


As soon as he was out of sight, the radio started up again like normal and I had to just make my way home. It shook me, but what can I do? How can I explain this to Lara? 

I didn't. 


I wouldn't be posting if it was just that, though. We’ll skip all of the boring shit in-between and I’ll cut to this morning.


I've been having some trouble with one of my teeth for a few weeks, the pain was sorta just my whole jaw for the first two weeks so I put it down to the accident at first. I did get whiplash and google told me that that could cause jaw pain so that was that for a while until then pain got more localised and it was clear that the issue was a specific tooth. 


I've been taking OTC’s and warming up Lara’s microwave heating pad and holding it to my jaw but this morning, I’d had enough. I know you're not meant to touch your teeth with your grubby digits especially when you think that there is a problem, so I hadn’t. Makes me feel kinda dumb now really. 


I took myself to the bathroom mirror about 8:30 this morning, washed my hands and got to work. It felt as if something foreign like a toothpick or a floss remnant had wedged itself somehow inside my tooth and after 4-5 minutes of yanking and scraping, I felt something cold hit my tongue. 


I spat it into my hand to see what had been bugging me and I was immediately confused. I’ve had 34 years on this planet, it's not too often that I come across something new. 


It looked like a pin, but it wasn't a pin.


I knew that I needed to find a way to inspect this tiny tooth inhabitant so I took a few photos with my phone to try and pick up the details that my eyes couldn’t. What I was holding did resemble a pin, the part that was directly inside my tooth was no thicker than a staple and no longer than an eyelash and it had a tiny round base that I assume was to keep it in place.



There was enamel residue on the base part, so I think that there was some kind of veneer adhesive or something ensuring it stayed stuck.
On the inside of the base was the only tangible clue, the letters **‘N.O.S’** had been engraved in tiny letters. 


So, I took to google. I tried a few searches like *‘N.O.S tooth pin’*, *‘N.O.S device’* but nothing yielded anything useful until I tried *‘N.O.S dental implant’.*


The A.I Overview at the top of the page said *“In some instances, the phrase ‘N.O.S Tooth Implant’ can be used to refer to the minuscule, pin-like devices used by psychologists to carry out Neural Observation Studies”.*


My eyes were pulled from the words I was trying to understand down to a search link result. It was *purple*, not blue, though. That usually means that my browser has accessed this page in the past, but I certainly had never seen it before. 


The search result was titled **‘Controversial Clinical Trial Shut Down In 2009 May Have Continued Without Consent’** and when I tell you that I've never clicked a link so fast in my life, I mean it. As the page loaded, I was already hovering my fingers over *‘command’* and *‘P’* on the keyboard so that I’d have a hard copy of whatever this was to look at, you've got to understand how quickly my paranoia was escalating in those moments. I'm not sure why, it just felt important. 


When it finally loaded, my eyes bounced from one disturbing keyword to another before settling on a line that read *‘…and even though the study was shut down due to the concerns surrounding ethical standards, evidence has come to light that suggest that a good number of the participants from the 2009 study are completely unaware that the clinical trial never came to a close.’.*


My brain rattled as it tried to process the words, nothing made sense. I have never pressed ‘print’ so fast. I don't know, I thought it might feel a little more real if I could hold it in my hands, you know?


I made my way to the printer to find that it had only printed the header of the newspaper it had been clipped from, that’s it.  None of the article content had printed so I switched back round to send it to print again. But, the article was gone. *Properly gone.*


I refreshed the page and got *404’d,* I pressed back and got a different error so I re-typed the google search to get it back that way and this time, google had no results. The A.I overview was gone. My search history? Completely intact *other* than the searches that pertained to what I'd found in my tooth. 


I was about to go and find Lara, I’d been spiralling for nearly an hour but as I looked up from my computer, there she was, stood, watching me from the doorway. 


“Ethan?” 


The homely warmth in her eyes, the singy-songy bounce in her voice that only comes out when she's talking to me, her signature hyper-energized sway while she stands, it was all gone. She looked like Lara, but she *felt* different. 
This thought seemingly fell straight out of my head, “Hey, babe. You seem…*off* this morning, everything alright?” 


What followed really did sound like her, the intonation in her voice was off, but she sounded otherwise just like my Lara, “Ethan, you look aghast. Can I get you anything?” 


Her voice was so flat. She sounded like an sub-par actor who hadn’t memorised her lines, I couldn't concentrate on her words. 


“Lara, I’m not sure what's going on. My tooth, I-” 


She cut me off, “Oh Ethan, you've done it, haven't you?”, a fleeting sigh being the only display of emotion from Lara so far, but even that felt inauthentic and weird.


It felt like a movie, I couldn't understand what was unfolding in front of me. I still don't understand. That's why I am here, I need someone to help me make sense of this.


The world seemed to cease for a brief moment and all I could hear was the subtle *click* that I knew to be my front door and I felt my morning coffee curdle in my gut.


I tried to stand at my desk but my leg muscles turned to spaghetti and I didn't have the strength, Lara didn't move a muscle. She didn't even flinch. The Lara I knew was apprehensive and jumpy at an unexpected knock at the door, her resolute stance in the doorway at this moment was more frightening to me than whatever I could hear now progressing up my staircase.


Now that I have a little bit of hindsight, I think I understand why the threat levels seemed so mismatched. Think of someone who you know really well. Someone you’re close to, your best friend, your brother, maybe *your* wife.

You know their routines, what they do and don’t like and you've seen them in enough situations to have a general idea of how they'll react in most circumstances; do you think you’d find it frightening if at a time when you were at your most vulnerable, they suddenly became cold, altered and unpredictable? 


As I opened my mouth to speak, two large men emerged from behind Lara with her still unaffected. My tongue dried up in an instant, I had no words. 


She moved now — just slightly forward to allow the two men into my office — her movement after so much standstill rekindled my adrenaline and mended the frayed wiring that connects my mouth to my brain. 


I managed two words, “done what?”


The men were now on either side of me, neither one of them speaking a word. I already knew I couldn’t fight them, for starters there were two of them but even if it were a fairer fight, my nervous system had already chosen ‘freeze’ rather than either of the more useful ‘fight’ or ‘flight’.


“Lara?” I sounded desperate. Like a fearful child seeking comfort from a parent. 


My growing panic and state of desperation made no impact on Lara. This wasn’t the Lara who was so overran with sympathy and compassion after my accident not long ago that she took two weeks off work and refused to leave my side for a moment because she was so concerned that I'd need her help and she wouldn't be there. This Lara was not that Lara.


Not *my* Lara.


My arms were restrained behind my back by one man as the other one retrieved something from an internal pocket in his jacket, this was all happening in my peripheral vision as I kept my gaze locked on Lara.


“I’ve done what?” 


My attention was pulled toward an intense piercing in my upper thigh that was imminently followed by a strange sort of disconnected warmth radiating through my body, my spaghetti muscles now a toxic blended sludge. 
My vision was trying to betray me but I put every ounce of my energy into focusing on Lara’s face,


“Oh Ethan.” Lara echoed the same performative sigh,


*”You’ve pulled the pin, haven't you?”*


That's the last thing I remember.
I woke up in my bed around 10:30pm.
No Lara. No men. No pin. All gone.
I've spent the last 3 hours tearing my house apart to find *any* scraps of Lara but there’s nothing. We’ve lived here *nine* years. 


There's nothing.


My phone is wrong. It *is* my phone but there’s no trace of Lara, no texts between us, no photos.

No Lara. 

Not only that, no *anyone*.

My contacts now consist of my barber, a couple restaurants and some old work contacts. 
No people, no friends, no Lara. 
My memory feels like one of those jigsaws that you might pick up second-hand at a charity shop — the kind that came to you without all of the pieces — the kind that you *never* had a chance to make whole. 
I don't know what to do.


I’m just so stuck on one thought. 
If I could re-do one thing in my life, I would *never* have pulled the pin.


I don't know who I am without her. I need answers. If anyone has any information about N.O.S, about the trial or similar trials, please reach out, *I need to remember.*

Whether you’re taking summer classes, gearing up for the fall, or just trying to dodge the dreaded ""summer slide,"" check out these quick tips to study smarter, not harder.

1. **The 25-Minute Power Boost (aka Pomodoro Method).** Instead of cramming for hours on end, give the Pomodoro Method a shot! Work for 25 minutes straight, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat this cycle! It’s a fantastic way to keep your mind engaged without burning out.
2.  **Leverage Low-Energy Moments.** Feeling a bit sluggish? Don’t push yourself to tackle heavy study material. Use those low-energy times for “easy wins” like going over flashcards, re-reading your notes, or organizing your study space. Every little bit counts!
3. **Turn Downtime into Learning Time.** Got some downtime while commuting, cooking, or just relaxing? Tune into a podcast, audiobook, or YouTube lecture. Passive learning is often underrated and a great way to absorb information without the pressure of traditional studying.
4. **Change Your Scenery.** Sometimes, a new environment can work wonders for your motivation! Try studying at a park bench, a cozy coffee shop, or even just a different room in your house. A little change of scenery can make studying feel less like a chore.
5.  **Embrace a 3-Day Study Week.** You don’t have to study every single day. Even dedicating just three focused study days a week can keep you on track without taking over your entire summer. Finding that balance is key to avoiding burnout!

Learning can be fun and breezy, even in summer, with the right strategies. What are your go-to tips for staying sharp while enjoying the sunshine? Share them below! 👇

It didn’t feel right,"So yesterday something happened that I can’t shake off. I don’t know if I’m overthinking or if something is genuinely off, but I figured maybe writing it out here would help clear my head

It was around 5:30 PM, raining pretty steadily I was walking back from hanging out with friends, I was heading toward to the store for buy something, cutting through a street I thought it’d be faster

That’s when I passed a café, I glanced inside and saw my mom. She was sitting at a small round table, facing the window, wearing that beige trench coat she’s had for years , it made me to recognise her easily 

Across from her was a man. I didn’t recognize him immediately, but then he turned slightly and I realized  it was my dad’s boss. Let’s just say, not someone you randomly bump into. He’s been to our house once or twice, and I’ve seen him at a Christmas dinner.

Now my mom had told me earlier that she was going out for some work  would be back late. Dad was at work, probably wouldn’t be home till after 8. So this wasn’t something I was expecting at all.

They weren’t doing anything inappropriate. But the vibe was just… off. She kept leaning in when she talked, smiling in this soft, careful way. At one point, she tucked her hair behind her ear  something I’ve seen her do when she’s nervous or trying to seem composed. He looked kind of tense too, stirring his coffee constantly but barely drinking it. They didn’t seem relaxed. It was like a conversation that had weight to it

I didn’t go in. I crossed the street and waited under a shelter. About 15 minutes later, they both got up. She put on her coat properly, fixed the collar, and followed him out into the rain. He didn’t have an umbrella, so they both kind of hurried to his car. She held her bag over her head and he opened the door for her before jogging around to the driver’s side.

She came home nearly an 2 hour later. She acted normal asked if I’d eaten, mentioned that she grabbed some coffee while returning. No mention of anyone else. 

I haven’t said anything. I don’t want to assume anything bad. But something about the whole thing  the secrecy the timing the specific lie  it just doesn't feel right.

I don’t think my dad suspects anything. And maybe there isn’t anything to suspect. Maybe it was a private convo about my dad’s job or some work thing I wouldn’t understand.

1lw8n07,https://youtu.be/6RdZabOnBd0,"SwiftUI Layout Guide: Master VStack, HStack, ZStack & Grids in 4 Minutes","So here's the thing - when I first started with SwiftUI, layouts were my biggest headache. I'd spend hours trying to figure out why my views weren't aligning properly, or why my grid wasn't behaving the way I expected.

VStack, HStack, ZStack, Grid, LazyVGrid... the options seemed endless, and honestly? The documentation didn't always make it clear when to use what.

After building dozens of iOS apps and making pretty much every layout mistake possible, I've finally put together a comprehensive guide that covers everything you need to know about SwiftUI layouts.

## What You'll Learn

In this 4-minute tutorial, I break down:

- **VStack & HStack fundamentals** - When to stack vertically vs horizontally
- **Alignment and spacing control** - Making your layouts look professional
- **ZStack for layered views** - Perfect for badges, overlays, and backgrounds
- **Grid layouts** - Clean, structured 2D content without the performance overhead
- **LazyVGrid & LazyHGrid** - When you need scrollable collections that perform well
- **Real-world decision making** - Which layout to choose for different scenarios

## Why This Matters

Look, I get it. Layout seems basic, but it's literally the foundation of every iOS app you'll build. Get this wrong, and you'll spend way too much time debugging simple UI issues instead of focusing on your app's core functionality.

The difference between a beginner and an experienced SwiftUI developer often comes down to layout decisions. Knowing when to reach for a ZStack instead of a VStack, or when LazyVGrid is overkill for your use case - these small decisions add up.

## What I Wish Someone Had Told Me

Actually, let me share something that would've saved me hours: **Spacer() is your best friend in HStack layouts**. I used to try complex alignment tricks when a simple Spacer would've done the job perfectly.

Also, here's a mistake I made way too often - using LazyVGrid for everything. Sometimes a simple VStack with HStacks is cleaner and more maintainable than a complex grid setup.

The tutorial includes complete code examples for each layout type, plus a real-world example that combines all of them into a practical profile view.

## Your Turn

What's been your biggest SwiftUI layout challenge? Are you team VStack or do you prefer working with Grids? Drop a comment below - I'd love to hear about your experiences and any specific layout problems you're dealing with.

And if this helps you avoid some of the layout headaches I went through, consider following me here on dev.to for more iOS development content.

1lw8lnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/1lw8lnw/my_lavaredo_120km_long_read_race_report/,My Lavaredo 120km (Long Read) Race Report,"Hey folks! I love writing about my races in excruciating detail, so here's my tale of running this year's Lavaredo 120k for anyone into reading such things, hope you enjoy!

*The Lavaredo Queen Race is a 120km mountain Ultra Marathon with 5800m of vertical gain held in the Dolomites of Northern Italy. The 2025 edition was held on 27th June, starts at 11pm, and the 1700 runners have a maximum of 30 hours to finish.*

**Part 1: The Night** (0km: Cortina - 42km: Misurina)

Race day. We'd made it. I’d tried to make it as relaxing a day as I possibly could. Me and my running friend and crew, Frank, headed into Cortina and did the bib pickup as early as we could, before returning to our lovely campsite in Alta Badia in time for lunch. Afterwards I tried to nap, but it didn’t work out. I was too wired, but I lay around and did my best to just stay calm and loose. I’d had a rough night’s sleep the evening before, normal for sleep before a race, but with the oncoming 11pm start, it was a bit of a concern.

When we got to the start line I found a quiet patch of grass to lay down on til I could hand over my dropbag, and I felt surprisingly chill. I found Frank, we drank coffee, I did some leg swings and resistance band warm-ups, it’s just a normal long run, I told myself. As the crowd of runners picked up I found a spot near the back of the pen that wasn’t too busy, I wanted to avoid as much of the pre-race hustle and bustle. So I just sat, breathed deeply, absorbed the energy around me and tried not to think too hard about the gargantuan nature of the task ahead.

Eventually, the clock approached 11pm and I stood up and joined the throng. As the hour arrive, the commentator’s encouraging words were lost within the first notes of ‘Ecstasy of Gold’ from the Good, the Bad and the Ugly - immediate goosebumps. But, exciting as it was, it would turn out to be more than a little anticlimactic— we at the back couldn’t move more than an inch for at least five minutes, and then awkwardly shuffled slowly forwards for another five. I’d heard so much about this race start being something of legend - was this really it? But eventually each of us made it to the front, squeezed through a narrow gate, passed under the arch, and it was on.

The grinding monotony of the last ten minutes was immediately forgotten as the crowd either side of me roared. All plans to ‘go out easy from the get go’ were discarded as I sprinted forwards, high-fiving what felt like every kid in Cortina. As I made it to the edge of the crowd I saw Frank filming, I gave him one last high-five, and then immediately slowed down to a jog as we reached the edge of town.

We eventually hit the first trails and started climbing out of town. It was busy in the first few k's, I felt a little pushed and dragged up some of the first steep climbs, but did my best to set my own pace and not have it dictated by anyone else. I could already hear a few people around me huffing and puffing in ways that seemed just totally reckless not even 30 minutes into a day long race. Thankfully it spread out quite a bit eventually, and the grades eased up, so I eventually found a nice flow and just followed the spot of my headlamp. While I wasn't paying too much attention to it, I noticed I was passing people already without much effort at all, especially on those 10-15% grades that I feel I excel at. 

We reached our first downhill, which started easy but got much more windy and technical down steep switchbacks as it went. I was in a train of people for a while, nobody really able to pass one another, or not really seeing the need given how many more people were ahead. It was silent and lovely in the woods. Eventually we hit the first aid station at Ospitale, which was fine, but only a bit frustrating due to the fact that they didn't have any taps, only bottled water that you had to queue for. So early in the race it felt a bit shit and concerning to have to paused for a number of minutes for what should be a 30 second job. Either way I just accepted it, dumped my trash and kept moving into the night. 

The next section was pretty good, more of a steep climb here and there, and I ended up again in a bit of a stream of runners moving around the same pace. I hadn't spoken to (or been spoken to by) anyone by that point, so I just asked some random dude how he was doing. He was a German banker from Frankfurt, and admittedly, not very interesting/my kinda person, but at 2-3am beggars can't be choosers, and it helped pass the time a little. It was interesting to see that he always pushed more on the steeper climbs, but when I suggested moving a little more deliberately on the lesser grades, he was having none of it. 

Eventually I stopped to refill water at a stream and he headed off, saying I'll catch him up. Then came the first stomach issue of the day, I don't know if it was bending down and putting pressure on my stomach, but when I stood up from filling the bottle I suddenly felt like I needed to puke. It was this kind of gag/retching feeling, more up in my esophagus than down in my stomach. I did bring something up, but not much, and felt infinitely better after, so to my relief I just kept on plodding up the trail. 

After the next aid station I was dog tired, so it’s all a little blurry. I remember I caught up with the German guy at some point, and eventually dawn started to break, which was a nice, hopeful omen. We ran a section together, which all of a sudden opened up into THAT GRADE and I just slipped past him and never saw him again. The next section continued to be really within my comfort zone, long, flowy, undulating trails where I could either power hike up or jog down. I began to see that everyone around me was already suffering pretty badly. People off to the side of the trail, kinda death marching up some of those hills, some puking going on. And while my head was tired from lack of sleep (this was the most sleepy I'd feel in the race), I was moving well and just kept putting one foot in front. 

The few kilometers before the aid station at Misurina were a tad frustrating, as I was caught behind this couple on a very tight single trail in the woods that I felt I could have moved 5-10% faster on, which all adds up over a few km's. I also had a ton of people behind me, which is awkward and a little stressful being the first person behind a slow bunch that seem absolutely disinterested in letting people pass. For me, if someone's been on my tail for more than 5 mins, I just let them go ahead of me, as I don’t enjoy being tailgated. But in the end, maybe it was good to be held back a bit, as my heart rate had started to get exceptionally low (I was in the 110’s), and the perceived effort felt like a 2/10 or something, really easy stuff. 

As soon as the trail opened up coming into Misurina, I bombed past them (it felt somehow great to show everyone who was still feeling good and could run at this point), and headed into the closing part of the first 1/3 of the race feeling good. I grabbed one or two things to nibble from the aid station, but mostly just needed water, downed a gel, and I wanted to try Red Bull to shake off the last of the night. That would end up being problematic however, as only had I finished rounding Lake Misurina that I brought up the Red Bull and maybe my last gel in a few big retches. I kept moving though, which I was relieved about , didn't panic, and again, thankfully, didn't feel any further issues after it was up and out of my system. Maybe it was the caffeine or carbonation, or maybe I'd overdone it on calories the last hours while I was moving slower, I don't know. But I just took some sips of tailwind, small mouthfuls of gel and kept going for the first major climb of the race, up to the Tre Cimi di Lavaredo.

**Part 2:** The Morning (42km: Misurina - 67km: Cimabanche)

So, this climb was known to be tough. We were headed up to altitude, and I'm pretty sure that my body was missing some calories after that puking session. I was also low on gels, and had had to resort to purely Tailwind, which kinda sucked, but I was still very glad to have it. People moved slowly, it was very rocky terrain, grades of up to 30-40%, and the sun had already started to get pretty warm and blast us in the face. It woke me up though, which was nice, and the vistas and views were already absolutely incredible. It was also nice to be able to physically see the Rifugio ahead of us, mentally that allowed me to pace things right and take my time. 

At the top there were only drinks, which again was a bummer given my lack of gels and how far it would be to Cimabanche, but I refilled, thanked the amazing, cold volunteers, and started a small section of downhill feeling surprisingly chipper. It climbed some more, but again, the views were lovely and distracting. Pete (my coach back in the UK) and Frank were also awake at this point, had sent some really nice, encouraging messages when I left Misurina that I was fast out of that Aid Station, that I looked fresh in a selfie I sent them... it was nice after what had been a fairly isolating night with not many people to talk to. 

Then the downhill started, and ironically, my mood along with it. I think it was namely due to the fact that the 80km race joins up with ours at that point, and man, those people were in a goddamn hurry. These were, maybe not the race leaders, but front of the pack, and it was just a stressful, claustrophobic mess on technical, tight single trails, steep and rocky with sheer drops on one side, where you can't always simply pause and let people go. And the ones that did go, really went. I saw one guy make an insane overtake where the loose rocks at the side of the trail started to give in, and he nearly slipped down what would’ve been a few hundred meters. 

I'm sad to say that the sudden intense vibe did very much let it get to me, I'm easily overwhelmed by people who don't seem to be aware of others, and in this environment and point in the race it really sucked. I envisioned the rest of the day being like this, and just felt sad and annoyed. They came in little streams, sometimes had a gap, so I used some of those spaces to calm down a bit, remind myself that it’s a race, and tried to tap into some of that learning I did with solving emotional problems during long runs. I’ve got a technique during runs where, if something is bothering me, I envision physically picking it up and tossing it behind me on the trail. Not sure if ti worked, but, either way, I was determined not to let it ruin my race. 

It was getting, hot, hot, hot too, especially as I came down into the valley approaching Cimabanche. And apparently the stress from other runners wasn’t quite over:

Arriving into Cimabanche, it's a pretty flat/gradual climb, but it was warm as fuck and swarming with both racers, tourists, e-bikes (ugh) so I just power hiked it in as best I could. At one point I was passing through this group of 2-3 (I think) tourist hikers, who'd kindly left a little gap in the middle of them. I wasn't fast, but I was definitely faster than them, so through the gap I went. 

Right as I went through them, this group of three 80km runners barged through at the same time on my left. The front one loudly tutted at me, and gave my pole (which was absolutely by no means in anyone's way) a very deliberate kick. And I was fucking. livid. haha. I automatically responded 'Don't you fucking dare tut at me, bro, I don't have eyes in the back of my head, you can wait one second'. He either didn't hear, didn't care, or didn't speak English, so off he went ahead, aaaaand off I went chasing after him in a very aggressive power hike/slow jog. I never left Zone 2, but suddenly I was ALIVE and had some shit to say, at least to my own legs. While I hated being taken to that angry place, it was a wakeup call that this is a race, not all these people are my friends. But I had the realization 5 mins later (after I never caught up to him), right before hitting the aid station, that I wasn't going to carry it in there with me, and found a way to let go of it.

I was a little concerned by having only taken in liquids so far, and a lot of Tailwind in the preceding hours, but wasn't bonking by any stretch. I knew when I got into the aid station that I'd need a bit of a reset, dropbag, gels, maybe change of socks... I started thinking about it now rather than when I got in. I was also aware that I was a bit off my time goal, or the one I guesstimated anyway, of around 10:00-10:30 at the halfway point. In the end I think it was about 10:45 when I got in and saw Frank, so behind, but nothing major. 

When I ran in he was there to cheer me, filming to send something to my family back home. I gave him a quick hug, and we stuck note for note to the rehearsed plan of handing him my watch and phone to charge, and he explained to me where he'd be waiting with everything prepared once I was through the station with my dropbag. I grabbed it, refilled on water, think I grabbed soup again, and easily found him, textbook. 

I wasn't hurting too much, and again he told me I was looking great (and somehow I believed him). We both acknowledged that the very ambitious 20 hour goal was definitely off the table, but it didn't matter. 24 hours also seemed kind of unattainable at the time, but I wanted to leave that there as a carrot to keep me moving intentionally, especially out of rest stops. We changed my socks, lubed my feet and other key areas, put on more sunscreen, changed shirt, and refilled my pack with gels and tailwind, and I guess I was out of there in 10-15 minutes or so. Much longer than earlier stops, but I think it was necessary to have a bit of a reset there. Frank was able to pack everything up for me (what a fucking star he'd turn out to be), and I got sent on my way into the hot afternoon.

**Part 3: The Climb** (*67km: Cimabanche - 97km: Col Gallina)*

Leaving Cimabanche, it was once again hot hot hot. From there we started with a deceptively hard climb, exacerbated by the heat and, again, the multiplied numbers of runners that were now around all the time. While we didn't say anything to one another, I felt at least a little bit of a bond with my fellow 120km runners. I also decided to try and see some positives, and gave myself an extra big metaphorical clap on the back when I passed an 80k runner with relative ease. In my head I was saying 'If I'm passing you, you have cause for concern.’I was being a bit of a competitive dick at this point, it has to be said. 

However, I was now definitely hitting something of a low. I remember having the thought, 'I'm not having a good time', albeit more in an emotional and social way. It was a lonely, lonely road. I’m very introverted, and personally love being alone and carving out solitary time in the mountains to be my way of connecting to me and nature, and I can very happily move for days on my own steam with nobody else around. But being so surrounded by people that didn't seem to even acknowledge one another's existence, no shared camaraderie or solidarity, it felt like city life. Busy and isolated, swarms of atoms all dancing round one another but never bonding. 

But, as I came into the next aid station, though a bit hot and bothered, I suddenly felt really good. I took some Naak drink that I hadn't tried yet, a lime flavour, and it just gave my whole tongue and being a big zap. I also got a text from Pete and Frank: 

**Pete**: Looks like you’re gaining a lot of places at every aid station! Great work man Keep grinding dizzle, you’re doing great 

**Frank**: Amazing work Michael! You just moved up 186 places between Cimabanche and this aid station! 

**Pete:** Textbook pacing dizzle! 

(Author's Note: You may also refer to me as M Dizzle if you like) 

And from that I just felt a huge boost. I hadn't realised I was moving that well, how many people I'd left behind at Cimabanche, and I was in and out of the most recent station in less than a minute. After a few km's I also found myself totally alone for 5 mins or so, which felt wonderful. No stress from behind, no one to maneuver around ahead. Given what I knew about what was about to come up, it felt wise not to overdo it, but I suddenly began to realise I was by no means feeling the worst in this race, I was not back at the farthest of backs of the race, but I was now in the top 1000 of runners and climbing in the ranks without really even forcing the issue. 

**Pete:** That's what it's all about. Keep eating, keep drinking, keep kicking ass 

Now. This climb. My fucking god. The sun was on us, it was relentless, no shade, no respite. Every single stream (and thank fuck there was a lot of them) I dunked my headband and cap and let them drip down my body for the next kilometer before doing it again. People were suffering with a capital S. Any small scrap of shade from a cactus and people were crowding into it just to get a brief break from being a bug under a magnifying glass. Again, thankfully I knew this climb, I've done it all before (albeit a lot cooler, there was even still snow here when I was here for the reccy in May), so while it was scary to know what was yet to come, at least it wouldn't be a god awful surprise. 

At the stream crossings I marched right through (lots of people were going to huge lengths to somehow go around or skip over it), and the blast of cold and wetness seemed to wake up my feet, though of course it also made them heavy for a while and risked some blisters, but none would come. While we're on my feet (literally and figuratively), they were gradually becoming the sore spot. The undersides of them, pads or whatever you call them, were tired and achey and sore as fuck. Not in a red raw way, just from having already taken, I guess, 90,000 steps or so, all in relatively minimal trail shoes (I run in the Salomon S-Lab Ultra 3 V2s, which aren’t known for their cushioning). It sucked, and it took a lot of the spring out of them, particularly on the downhills, but I remember acknowledging also that the rest of my legs still felt like, maybe not pure gold, but definitely bronze. No pain, no soreness in the quads of calves, they were just motoring along and would go on to never feel beat up. But we'll get to that. 

Once again nutrition was proving to be an issue. Gels were spent and I was understandably sick of Tailwind, but I knew without it I'd be dead in the water/sun, so kept on sipping it and providing a steady, albeit sickly, form of calories to my tired body. The last climb of that push was. hard.

Looking back now, I realise that this was the tipping, race defining point, 90km in (I'd only ever run 80km in my life before), the longest I'd ever been on my feet, the longest I've been awake in possibly years. I was at the well and looking down at it, realising, ok, I think this day is done feeling easy, this is where we're gonna have to dig deep. I haven't felt that way in so long. We just don't have to go there in training or in blissful long runs in the mountains. This is the test and challenge I came here to face, to see what and who I am when we get here. There's no hiding from it anymore, this is the hardest single physical thing I've ever done, and we're still moving. 

*We're at the top of the climb, we're sipping coke and chewing on some dry bread the beautiful mountain rescue had laid out for us. We're descending, slowly, on battered feet. We think we're heading down, but no, 200m of climb before you really go down and see a friendly face. The sun is still blasting but at least it’s on its way into its early evening wind down routine. Our tired hands scramble around our pack. BINGO. We find a stray gel that had burrowed its way down into a crevice and quickly devour it. We're dropping again, we know we're fucked, we're gonna need to rest at that aid station, it feels like we've been so, so slow, surely we must be majorly behind. Surely this is gonna end up being a 26-27 hour day. How are we possibly going to turn this around?*

I run into Col Gallina, again to Frank's massive smile. I shake my head, draw my fingers across my neck, and say 'it's been. so. hard.' and almost break down in tears. He tells me I'm moving incredibly well, that, again, I've climbed a lot of places, I almost think he's lying, it can't be the case, I'm dying here. He tells me to get what I need, that we'll take as long as it takes to get me back on the trail. 

I grab more Naak because that shit worked, maybe some more soup, find Frank and flop down on a towel in the fetal position. My whole body just exudes fatigue, I've never felt that tired in my life. I could lay on that towel for an eternity. But in the meantime, Frank is busying away, removing my shoes from my slowly reanimating corpse, re-lubing my feet for me, putting on fresh socks, applying sunscreen, just being a complete and total hero. He's also telling me that, according to the UTMB app, I have a finish line prediction of, I shit you not, a 22:30 finish. 23.5 hours. I'd somehow improved my time in the hardest section of any race I've ever done in my life. I can't fucking believe it. Before I know it I'm on my feet, I try and find somewhere in the AS to take a monstrous gel shit that's been burying its way through my colon for the last 10 hours, but no dice, it's too far back down the trail to bother, so I decide to deal with it later. 

I realise it's time to go again, to deal with, again, an impossibly steep climb, one I'm genuinely fearful about. But away I go. My legs seem to be moving okay, my feet don't seem to hurt as much anymore. Five minutes later and I'm puking my guts up mid power hike. Everything I'd eaten in the last hour is on the floor and all over my shirt. Fuck it. I sip at Naak, I take a small mouthful of gel, which is now all I can manage, but I know if I keep doing that, I definitely won't thrive, but I'll survive. I tell myself out loud 'You. have. to. keep. eating.'

**Part 4: Sunset** (97km: Col Gallina - 112km)

So we start this climb, me and, mostly, my 120km torture-mates. Silent as they are, I like them. You can spot us from behind, no need to see our bib colour. We're all singular in our purpose, and couldn't give a damn about the pace anymore, this is move or die, and the only way is forwards. 

At some point I offer a guy behind me to go ahead and pass, as I feel I'm really at my limit and like a snail. He barks something in Italian that seemed to say 'No. Keep going', so I do. My bowels ache with the effort of not straight up shitting my pants. I know there's a Rifugio at the top of this endless climb, and I plan on making the evacuation happen there, wherever I can, if it kills me. After an eternity I reach the top, they have a real, functioning toilet, and being in an actual building, under a roof, in a working lavatory with hand soap just feels like a former life. I'm so fucking grateful to have been able to do that, and I can suddenly, finally think. 

*Michael, you're at 100km. That is insane. You're feeling terrible but moving so well. Frank's right, this is not fucking over. You're gonna drop down into Passo Giau in the next hour and guess fucking what. That's the penultimate last aid station. You're in the last chapter, this is it, unless you stop eating there's actually no longer even a possibility you're not going to finish this shit. Get fucking going.* 

So I jogged downhill, feet caving that bit more with each and every step. People are slipping and sliding on the loose stones and scree, I used my poles in my sore and sunburnt hands to somehow try and stay on my own. Again, the sheer thought of putting another gel into my mouth already made me wanna puke. My tongue felt like a sock that had been dipped in maple syrup then coated in granulated sugar, it had had enough. 

But before I knew it, I could see Passo Giau looming in the distance, and I was already steadily jogging down the trail towards Frank, who again, laughed in that way he had the hours before, and buried me in a hug. I have a video of all these meetings, and side by side they paint such an accurate picture of my rise and demise. At this point, you can hear me croaking while putting on my sunglasses,  'I don't want you to see my eyes. Oh god.', but looking back at that video now, those legs were somehow still fucking going. While I want to be in and out in minutes, I know there's shit to do, and I unveil my strategy out loud in desolate but pragmatic tones. I can't eat. I have to eat. I tell Frank no more Tailwind, it's making me want to down sulfuric acid just to taste something different. Just water, plain water, beautiful Dolomites water, and I'll try and force gels down. I take some Coke, which helps somehow, not sure why, and I do what I should've done at Cimabanche (and Col Gallina) and brushed my motherfucking teeth. And oh god what a difference that made. I felt renewed in my whole eating department, fresh and clean and bright and able to eat anything (probably a major overstatement, but let’s be hopeful together for a moment). 

I say goodbye to Frank for the last time before the finish line. We both know I'm nearly there, this is it, and yet again, I'm fearful of what I know, that the climb ahead is absolutely brutal, perhaps the shortest but steepest single climb of the race. But I also knew, once you're up it, you're at the top of that very literal and metaphorical mountain, and you're going down to the finish line. 

So off I go, down onto a windy little single trail that was covered in snow and nearly impassable the last time I was here. As I go along, again, legs moving well, a group of 4-5 20-something-year old women approach from ahead of me. Now, most of the day, the lovely civilians had done everything they could to let us racers pass, and were unbelievably supportive and kind in their cheering and encouragement, and frankly I felt guilty for being there and ruining their nice, leisurely hikes. This group didn't seem like they were going to let me go, so I gestured for them to come first, albeit with a little bit of 'but please hurry' in my face/voice. They were really sweet, said thank you, wished me luck, and I smiled and tried to whisper thanks, but nothing came out. 

Just as the last one was passing me, this 40-50 year old man came flying through the entire group, before physically grabbing the last one by the shoulders and moving her out of his path. She was very surprised and confused. All to gain, what, 5 seconds? It was a pretty sheer drop off the edge of that trail, and one misstep from either would’ve broken both their necks. I found my voice, quickly apologised to her and yelled to him that he’s a fucking psychopath. Maybe two minutes later I caught up with him. He’d bent down on the side of the narrow path to tie his shoelace, and in doing so he left his hiking poles spread horizontally and directly across the entirety (and then some) of this tiny little trail that me and 5 other runners now needed to pass him on. Genuinely the dumbest asshole on this planet. In my rage I went full circle from my own pole kicking escapade earlier in the day, and smacked his poles out of the way with my own in order to pass him. I said out loud to anyone and no one that that guy 'is the absolute WORST', but nobody else seemed to notice or care. Sometimes I feel like only I see this shit, or maybe I’m the only one who cares. 

5 minutes after that, and apparently we’re still not done, the guy dangerously overtakes every single one of us, scrambling onto the sides of the trail to do so, bounding up this little but technical climb, which I knew immediately would come back to haunt him, given how insanely steep it was about to get. I make a point of remembering what he looks like, as I had a feeling I'd be seeing him again. Write that down. 

And up, up, up we went. As already stated, this is a fucking climb, around 250m in less than a kilometer, with the top genuinely being a hands and knees, smashing poles into the ground to lurch yourself upwards, gaining what felt like centimeters with every agonizing step moment. But, my fucking god, I made it. The wonderful race volunteers scanned my bib and sent me off on my way, and down we fucking went.

**Part 5: The Finish Line** (*112km - 123km: Cortina D'Ampezzo)*

Golden hour was over, we'd lived an entire life in a day, the sun had dipped beneath the sprawling mountains of the Dolomites and everything was quiet. I aimed my legs downwards. Parts of those trails are so random and carved in all sorts of lines and directions, but I've done this before and it was like the path of least resistance was already painted on the trail. I suddenly heard English being spoken somewhere behind me, an 80km runner was sending a voice note to somebody, recounting how 'the trail had been a lot more technical and rocky than he thought', and I was like... ya know what, you're the first guy I've agreed with in some time, and I can’t miss this opportunity.

I asked, 'Are you Bri'ish?' in my exhausted, lazy Northern accent, and he answers, ‘yes’. You could immediately hear the kind of joy and relief in his voice, as though we were both meeting a real life human for the first time in a vast, endless open world landscape after having only interacted with silent NPC's for days. We shared and shared for the next 10 minutes or so, not necessarily about interesting things, it just felt amazing and wonderful to talk again. I forgot where I was, what I'd put myself through for the last night, day and now evening, and just headed forwards together. Down to the right, we could see our destination. Cortina had begun to light itself up. If you strained your eyes you could even make out the clocktower, the landmark where the race starts and ends. 

My new friend told me he's gonna run, he seemed fresh given the 75k he had on his legs. I said I needed to stop for a moment, I had to find and put on my headlamp, try and eat something, but that maybe I'll see him at the finish line. I do my tasks and once again begin to follow a beam of light, my feet are wrecked, but legs remember how to run, we've done this so many times, just try and use gravity, I tell myself.

And lo and behold, surprise surprise, who do I pass? Mr-trying-to-take-out-everyone-and-everything-in-his-path, that’s who. He's staggering downwards, weaving all over the trail, clearly entirely blown up and doesn't seem to have much left to get him back home. I feel kind of sorry for him as I breeze on through, but also, screw that guy. If he'd been good to others, he'd have also been good to himself.

But enough with that, we have one last conflict for the night. At 115km, I was weaving downwards, poles still in hand, taking small pieces of the ground impact forces with them. An Italian 80k runner/boomer moved past me on my right, making a comment as he went. I swiftly replied 'Sorry, I don't speak Italian', and with his back turned to me, he held his folded up poles aloft and said it again. In the moment, I assume he's directing me to put my poles away, maybe for safety on the downhill, (this was a wiiiiide trail for the first time in a long while, and at least three runners, all with poles in tow, could have passed), but since I wonder whether he was trying to advise me that I'll be marginally faster without them. 

But either way, 115k Mick does not want or appreciate advice at this point. 'I'm UUUUUUUUUSING them bro!' I exasperatedly called after him. He seemed to shrug his shoulders. I almost laughed at the notion that this was the time and place to hand out tips and advice to fellow runners. At this point in, I felt maybe we’ve proven that you might know at least one or two things about moving effectively in the mountains. But sod it, onward we went. 

We arrived at the very last aid station by the beautiful Croda Lago, lit up like fireflies by the lights of the tents. I'm aware that I haven't been eating, and that I still have to be. Again, nothing seemed tempting, they were all out of Naak drink, so I filled half a flask of Coke and wager that, if all goes ok, that'll get me there. I said a final thanks, and joined a group of 5-10 runners, all of whom were heading back out into our last chapter in the woods. 

I don't know if it was the dark, the steepness, the pressure of runners front and back, but this last section felt like it took forever. You could barely see, the trees were so thick and the trail so tight and sheer (ironically, given Mr Pole Advice Man) it would've been almost impossible without cheat sticks to keep ourselves upright. I do go down on my ass once, which I think is probably acceptable in a full day of climbing and descending technical mountains. It hurts, and I'm not happy about it, but dust myself off and keep moving. 

Then we hit a bit of a final sad moment. I'd been watching the distance count of my watch climb and tick steadily towards 120km, and right as we hit '119.5km' I saw a sign on the side of the trail that said '4km til finish'. Both me and the other runners around me seem to groan in unison. 4km is a fucking eternity in that state, and when you've been averaging around 5km/h for an entire day, it doesn't take a genius to know we're still not done here. But scrambling for some joy, I acknowledged, quietly in the dark to myself, that my elapsed time had said '24:00:00' right around the time the distance touched 120km. In my own little, secret, dark world, I'd hit my goal of 120km and 5800m in one day. 'Good job, Big Mick, now let's bring it home'. 

I was scraping the last little drops of coke from my flask, trying to find any scraps of sugar left in my pack to drive me forwards. My feet were also suffering badly, and while I'd been able to run the first points of those descents, when I realised that 24 hours to the finish line wasn't gonna happen, I just accepted and slowed down to a power hike. There was no more need for heroics here, we needed to move again like we were gonna be out here for hours, not minutes. Just move in a way your body can manage, I told myself, and my boy you're gonna be there soon. 

Finally, finally the woods opened up and gave way to the first hushed, residential streets of Cortina. One house we passed had a group of supporters who'd clearly been there all day, who were blasting up beat music, shouting bravi, and had laid out a plate of fucking watermelon for us all. Watermelon. What a fucking incredible food. The Australian guy next to me said 'I've been craving this all day', and I fucking agreed with him. It was the last little blast of sugar and life my system needed. My 0.5% battery ticked momentarily back up to 1%, and I knew that was enough. 

As we hit the centre of Cortina, I suddenly lit up. I knew that when I turned that corner at the top of this hill, there was gonna be a crowd of cheering supporters, the finish line, it was all finally going to be over. And if we're gonna end this, let's do it right. 

*I power up the hill, passing a final group of 80km runners, one of whom I remember looks a little stunned by this skinny, bedraggled 120km dude that had snapped into his emergency gear in the last moments. I bomb down the busy streets in a full on sprint, the bars* ove*rflowing with people, all of them drunk and cheering, holding out their hands for high fives. A smile is planted on my face. All that agony, fatigue and effort is converted into sheer joy as people pound batons against the floor, railings, buildings in a pulsing drum beat that my dizzying heart rate seems to match.* 

*I suddenly hear Frank calling from the side of the railing, just as he'd done 24 hours earlier. I catch his eye, beam at him, and point at him in a way that I hoped expressed ‘you got me here, you’. And finally, with the last remaining drops of energy I run forwards under the finish line, arms outstretched, before collapsing against the railing. There was no more road, no more trail, nothing more to give. A tired Italian woman puts a medal over my neck, and I stand briefly alone in the crowds of runners with their loved ones, and don't know what to do or who to be. It's like I'd had a singular purpose or puzzle that every part of me had to scramble to find solutions to solve for an entire day, and now it was done and I had nobody left to be.*

Frank appeared, and I fell into his arms. All I know is I thanked him again and again, he told me he was so proud of me, and I accepted it openly, something it's hard for me to do. It takes a lot for me to be proud of myself, but I was proud of that. 

And as long as it had taken, suddenly it was all over. We were back in the car, my shoes off, feet on the dash, every muscle in my legs was finally able to relax into almost a painful orgasm, a total, final and absolute release.

It was the hardest thing I’ve ever asked myself to do, and now I knew my answer.

*I finished the Lavaredo Ultra Trail 120K in 24 hours and 18 minutes, crossing the line in 769th place out of 1700 starters.*

1lw8ies,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/1lw8ies/whats_your_goto_strategy_for_the_local_business/,"What’s your go-to strategy for the local business ""content treadmill""","Hey r/content_marketing,
I've been thinking a lot about content strategy for small, local, brick-and-mortar businesses. I'm talking about your neighborhood cafe, bakery, yoga studio, barber shop, etc.
These businesses are great, but they often have a very limited set of core offerings. A coffee shop has coffee, pastries, and a nice vibe. A mechanic fixes cars. They don't have a constant stream of new products, features, or company news to announce like a tech company does.
This seems to create a relentless ""content treadmill"" problem. They need to post consistently on social media to stay relevant, but they risk posting the same ""cup of latte art"" photo or ""this week's special"" graphic over and over again.
The standard advice is ""show behind the scenes,"" ""post customer testimonials,"" or ""do a meet the staff."" And that's solid advice for a while. But how do you sustain that for 12, 24, or 36 months without it becoming just as repetitive and stale?
I'm genuinely curious about how other pros approach this specific challenge.
What do you find is the single biggest content struggle for these types of businesses? Is it ideation, creation, or something else?
How do you keep their content feeling fresh and valuable long-term without a huge budget or a dedicated marketing team?
How much emphasis do you place on recycling/repurposing their core ""evergreen"" information (hours, services, location, top-selling products) vs. trying to create completely new content each week?
Looking forward to hearing your strategies and workflows!

1lw8fp0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lw8fp0,Part 3: what Joong said in Brazil,"
I had no choice but to split these three parts because Reddit only allows 40,000 characters, and I ended up writing way too much. So, I was forced to make the third part a separate thread, even though that wasn’t my original plan. But whatever, it’s fine. I’ll just add a link in the post where I mentioned there would be three parts, so people can easily find their way to the third part. It’ll feel like a natural extension of the series. Honestly, it’s a bit annoying, but hey… it is what it is.

Anyway, 

❤️✨❤️PART 3: What Joong said in Brazil:

What’s JD fandom chose to wrote: 

Dunk adds: That's"" it, at the end of the day, we're just humans. There are many good comments, but also bad ones. And, as he said, sometimes false rumors appear. Like: 'Oh, he's dating so-and-so, such-and-such...' But, many times, we're just friends, you know?""
Joong explains a bit about the impact of these rumors in the industry: ""And even among friends in our company, GMMTV, sometimes we can't even show that we're close because these rumors end up
messing things up. It stops us from showing true friendship because of judgments-both from outside and inside the industry. That's why what happens behind the scenes is very different from what people see.""

Let’s Talk About “Ghost Ships”, Double Standards, and What Joong Really Said ✨

So apparently someone said this:

“I hope yall know that for every ghost ship and fake dating rumor you start about actors with their friends, there’s friendships & real people being pushed from freely interacting. In a year don’t cry about how we don’t get interactions anymore, yall did this.”

Okay. Let’s break this down.

📌 1. First of all: What did Joong & Dunk actually say?
Joong:

“In this industry, no matter what we do, there will always be people judging us. The most important thing is to stay true to yourself and do what you love. People judge us without knowing what’s really going on.”

Dunk:

“At the end of the day, we’re just humans. There are many good comments, but also bad ones. And, as he said, sometimes false rumors appear. Like: ‘Oh, he’s dating so-and-so, such-and-such…’ But, many times, we’re just friends, you know?”

Joong adds:

“Even among friends in our company, GMMTV, sometimes we can’t even show that we’re close because these rumors made us like… what happens behind the scenes is very different from what people see.”

So yes, they are saying rumors can make friendships harder to show. But notice:
⚡️ They said “rumors” in general not just “ghost ships.”
⚡️ And they said the judgments come from outside AND inside the industry.
⚡️ So it’s not just about fan theories; it’s about an entire culture of over-judging and policing artists’ private lives.

📌 2. Now about that comment…
This person seems convinced it’s the “ghost ships” like JoongEst that are the problem. But wait

💥 If we follow their logic, then ANY ship, even official pairings like JoongDunk and WilliamEst, should also “push real people from freely interacting”.
	•	Isn’t JoongDunk a ship?
	•	Aren’t people constantly speculating about Joong and Dunk being a couple?
	•	So why doesn’t Joong avoid Dunk? Why is he always so comfortable with him?

Answer: because it’s not just about the existence of a ship. It’s about how toxic certain parts of fandoms get when they fight each other or when they feel entitled to control artists’ lives.

This is why Joong literally said “what happens behind the scenes is very different from what people see.” He’s not saying “we’re not close,” he’s saying “we’re close but can’t show it” because of people’s toxic reactions.

📌 3. Double standards much?
So when it’s JoongEst , it’s suddenly “fake,” “delusional,” and “killing friendships.” But when it’s JoongDunk or WilliamEst, it’s cute, wholesome, and fine? Be for real.

If shipping really destroys relationships, shouldn’t Joong also be hiding from Dunk? Shouldn’t Dunk also avoid showing closeness with Joong? Yet here we are: public hugs, photos, interactions. So clearly, the issue isn’t shipping, it’s fans who make drama, fight, and create a hostile environment.

⸻

Let’s also be honest: the reason Joong isn’t comfortable showing closeness with Est probably has less to do with “ghost ships” and more to do with homophobia inside and outside the industry. As in: their friendship or relationship, is not perceived as “harmless fanservice.” It’s perceived as something real, and that’s why it’s policed.

⸻

📌 4. For the record: JoongEst  doesn’t hurt anyone.


Unlike toxic fans who fight other fandoms, insult people online, break their friendships and send hate to anyone not supporting their favorite ship, JoongEst  shippers are just here observing and theorizing based on public content.e
We don’t claim it’s “confirmed.” We don’t harass Joong, Est, or anyone else.
We don’t attack other ships either. So how exactly are we the problem?

If anyone is “pushing people away from freely interacting,” it’s the ones creating drama and spreading hate, not people quietly theorizing on Reddit.


📌 5. My take? Joong’s words only confirm what I’ve always believed.
He basically admitted:

“We’re close, but we can’t show it because of people’s toxic reactions.”
So what people see on stage or on socials doesn’t reflect what’s happening behind the scenes.

And isn’t that what JoongEst shippers have been saying since day ones?

📌 6. Let’s keep the same energy.
If you’re going to blame “ghost ships” for ruining friendships, then also admit JoongDunk, WilliamEst, and every BL pairing ever are fake and harmful. Or accept that shipping itself isn’t the problem, it’s fandom toxicity.

Because the truth is:
✔️ Joong doesn’t hide his others GMMTV colleagues like, Dunk, or Book or anyone else…
✔️ Joong hides Est.
And there’s probably a reason. A very obvious one.

So until people stop enabling double standards, JoongEst shippers aren’t going anywhere.

❤️✨❤️ “The Truth About Why Joong & Est Started Hiding”❤️✨❤️

Let me tell you a little story. Do you know why Joong and Est started hiding? It wasn’t because of us, the so-called “ghost shippers.” It wasn’t because of fan theories. It wasn’t because people like me analyzed their moments. ( I wasn’t even here😂😭)

It was because of the fans of the official pairings. Yes, them.

The insults I saw thrown at Est? Absolutely unbelievable. People called him an opportunist. They called him a wh*re. They said he was ugly (excuse me?! Est? Ugly? Be serious). They said Joong was “just using” him like a h*le, and would move on. There were even YouTube videos where people blatantly said these things. Go look them up, I’m not making this up.

Some of these so-called fans even claimed Est was going to “ruin Joong’s career” because of their closeness. They accused Est of being “clingy” and “trying to trap Joong into marrying him someday.” 
They accused Est of trying to trap Joong into marrying him. 
Like Wait… can we talk about this? 😂 Y’all were really out here saying “Est trying to trap Joong into marriage’ like Est was gonna do WHAT exactly? Pretend to be pregnant? 😭 Like he’s gonna post an ultrasound pic with the caption: ‘baby loading… Joong be responsible’ 🍼🤣 Be serious for two seconds. Breathe. Now read your own comments out loud. Do you hear how ridiculous you sound? Because I’m crying laughing over here.😭😭😂

But wait, it gets worse.
Some fans outright threatened Joong’s career. They said they’d ruin everything for him so that he would have no choice but to “settle” with Est because “he clearly wants him too much.” They said they’d destroy his popularity so he could “live quietly” with Est.

Do you hear yourselves? That’s not shipping, that’s harassment. That’s obsession.


And where were Joong’s fans or Est’s fans defending him during this? Nowhere. Complete silence.

So don’t you dare say it’s us, the ones who see their real bond and talk about it, that are “ruining their friendship.” No. It’s your toxic behavior that pushed them into the shadows.

💔 The reality is this: Joong and Est share a deep, authentic connection, whether as friends or as something more. But they can’t show it because the second they’re seen together, people attack Est. People attack Joong.

And yet, one day, they will stop hiding. One day, they’ll choose to live openly as themselves, whether it’s showing their friendship or their love. And when that day comes, the same people who threw stones will act shocked, like, “Oh my God, how could this happen?!”

That’s why I speak. I’m not here to force anything. I’m not here to “ship recklessly” or invade their private lives. I’m here to open people’s eyes. To plant the possibility in their minds so when Joong and Est do step into the light, the fandom doesn’t explode into harassment and hatred.

🔑 Because let’s be clear: The insults I saw were far worse than what I’m telling you here. People threatening to burn Joong’s house down if he stayed close to Est. People telling Est, “You’re beneath him. Don’t talk to him.” Can you even comprehend how disgusting that is?

The day Joong and Est refollowed each other ? I remember fans saying, clearly, publicly, that they would go burn Joong’s house down because “they know where he lives” and that he should “leave Est alone.”

And yet, somehow, it’s us, the JoongEst shippers, who are the problem? Be serious.

I remember fans of William attacking Joong, saying he was “too invested in Est’s life,” acting like Joong was some kind of pest who couldn’t stay away. Meanwhile, others were insulting Est, saying he was “ugly” or “clingy.”

You’re out here throwing hate at both of them, calling Joong a nuisance, calling Est a mistake and you still think we’re the toxic ones?

Let’s stop pretending. Let’s be brutally honest again:

Joong and Est have a real connection, far more authentic than Joong/Dunk or William/Est. And deep down, you know it. That’s why it burns you so much to see them together.

It’s funny, and by funny I mean tragic, because the real toxicity isn’t coming from us. It’s coming from the people who insulted Joong for “caring too much” about Est. From the ones who celebrated when they stopped interacting. From the fans who cheered because they thought they had “won” by breaking their bond.

Do you realize how messed up that is?

This isn’t about ships anymore. This is about two people who had to hide their closeness, not because of silent fans like us, but because of your public, loud, disgusting toxicity.

So please. Don’t ever try to rewrite history and pin this on JoongEst fans. We weren’t the ones threatening careers, insulting appearances, or plotting to burn someone’s house down.

That was you.

Meanwhile, you want to blame shippers like me? You think we are the problem because we see the connection between Joong and Est and discuss it? Be serious. I’m responsible for my words, not for how people react. I don’t invade their lives. I don’t cross boundaries. I observe what THEY choose to share publicly. Period.

And let’s get one thing straight: I’ve never and will never tell Joong, “Stay with Est.” Or Est, “Stay with Joong.” I’m not delusional. I admire their dynamic, I analyze their moments, but I know my limits. Unlike some of you, I don’t impose my fantasies on their lives.

On that harassment period 
No one stood up for them.
No one said, “Hey, maybe we’re crossing a line.”
Instead, people were celebrating when Joong and Est stopped interacting publicly.

I saw people rejoicing like:
✨ “Oh look, Joong doesn’t like Est’s posts anymore! It worked!”
✨ “Finally, Est isn’t the first to like Joong’s photos anymore. We saved him!”

You seriously find this normal? You think it’s healthy to pressure two people out of showing basic friendship because your ship insecurities can’t handle it?

And you expect me, ME, to stay silent? So the harassment can continue? So the official ships can flourish while Joong and Est’s connection is buried?

No. You clearly don’t know me.

The JoongEst fandom was quiet at first. We saw their closeness, but we kept it to ourselves. It wasn’t until the toxic fans went too far, attacking Est for existing, celebrating Joong pulling away, that we spoke up.

And now, you want to say we’re the problem? You want to say our theories are “ruining their friendship”?

Be serious. We weren’t the ones threatening careers. We weren’t the ones insulting their appearances. We weren’t the ones trying to police who they’re allowed to interact with.

We were observing. Silently. Respectfully. Until your behavior forced Joong and Est to hide.

So no, I won’t shut up now. I won’t pretend your toxic double standards never happened.

So if you’re mad at me for believing in JoongEst, ask yourself: Why aren’t you mad at the people who bullied Est in the first place? Why aren’t you mad at the ones who created the hostile environment that made them hide?

🙃 One day, when they stop hiding, remember this conversation. Remember who tried to prepare you for reality,?and who buried their heads in the sand.

🌟 Bonus: The Bright Side

And honestly? This whole conversation Joong said in Brazil, actually reassures me about Joong and Est. Because if you read carefully, Joong didn’t say “we’re not close.” He said “we can’t show how close we are because of people’s reactions.”

That means behind the scenes, they’re fine. More than fine. They’re great. The problem isn’t their bond, it’s the fans and the toxic environment that force them to hide it.

So next time someone tries to use Joong’s words as “proof” that JoongEst isn’t real, remember: he literally said what happens backstage is very different from what people see. ( like I say every day).😏

✨ Translation of what Joong said: JoongEst is thriving. Sorry not sorry.

So I finished, I talked about the three topics 

🌿 Closing Thoughts:

Let me say this clearly: I’m not a fanatic. I’m not the type to blindly support everything just because I like someone. That’s not love, that’s obsession.

When I like someone, it’s because I want to see them grow, do great things, and succeed. And real love means being able to recognize their weaknesses and mistakes too, not clapping like a pigeon for every single thing they do. If that makes me “negative” in your eyes, so be it. But I refuse to lose my objectivity for anyone.

And to be honest, I didn’t create this space to collect comments or please people. I started it to share my thoughts and speak my truth. Comments are always nice, of course, but they’re not mandatory. Whether you agree, disagree, or choose to stay silent, it’s fine.


 “You stop your official ship theories, and maybe I’ll stop mine. Until then? Stay mad.”🥱


I’m gonna talk about JoongEst soon.

2.	⁠Sennheiser: in-ear, amazing sound with bass .. lossless becomes ultimate being in-ear even with low volume. but it is very very bulky .. even a sudden little stretch .., you stuck with chair and boom .. left side gone.

i am not sure whether Pods will last 3-4 years or not .. my brain wants ROI .. again it is *on-ear* .. low volume hibernation will not be possible ....  Pods Pro out of dimension ..

I've been living in Paris for over 8 years, and I've always been really into food.

I cook quite a lot, and I've tried a lot of places around Paris. The list won't be that long, but here are my favorite places to eat at around the city. It won't be the cheapest places, just the spots where I think the food is best.

**My favorite pizzas places:**

Napolitan:

*Fratelli Castellano*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/7ibeoySce3VeaCMn8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7ibeoySce3VeaCMn8)

Somehow this place isn't recommended amongst the best pizzas places in Paris, while I think it's overall the best dough in the city. Classical pizzas. Toppings are also really good, and the athmosphere of the place is not pretentious at all (hard to be more down to earth than what they did with the place), personnaly love it. Not as expensive as the second spot as well. Advised to book in advance or take to go.

Neo Napolitan:

*Oobatz*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/JWuqWwohjcTe7Bc16](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JWuqWwohjcTe7Bc16)

New spots created by an Ameican named Dan who used to be a baker. Insanely light sourdough dough. Toppings can get creative. The small con is that pizzas can get expensive (more than 20 euros). Can be hard to get a spot.

NY style

*Jay's pizzas*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/3H3ihRAqTraJ8gck9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3H3ihRAqTraJ8gck9)

Dough is good, really crispy, not a fan of the toppings but there isn't a shit ton of NY style pizzas in Paris. Price is also ok.

Not a fan of the newcomer Rori rori rori, find it dry as hell, not my thing.

Roman pizza:

**Mexican**

*Comer Paris.mexico*

Really nice and passionate Mexican chief, makes a really good barbacoa. Not the cheapest option around but the best mexican food I have tried here. I would say it's not traditionnal though, more like a french mexican cuisine.

*Do et Riz*

A bit pricy but worth every penny.

**Korean food:**

*Yory*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/K7KvMUWo6pw7jCou8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K7KvMUWo6pw7jCou8)

Same as mexican, not a traditional korean restaurant but the chief is so good. They are also good friends and they deserve every success they get. I have tried some very special dishes at times as entrée if you are there on a good day.

**Best quality for the price restaurant:**

*JJ Beaumarchais*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/1F9jLdNf3Us3Ha4F9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1F9jLdNf3Us3Ha4F9)

Was my favorite restaurant for years, rarely got dissapointed eating there. And as a bonus it's not the most expensive one around for that quality. Not my favorite wine selection though.

**Creperie**;

*Tanguy*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/hfXiFRHd1zqae8Cx6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hfXiFRHd1zqae8Cx6)

As an avid Crepes eater, by far the best, I have tried a ton of others around here and outside of Paris, and this one ranks really high on my list outside of Brittany. Crisp dough, very nice toppings. Nice cider selection as well.

**Cheese store:**

*Fromagerie Goncourt*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/sagDXPriA7weEhvT6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sagDXPriA7weEhvT6)

Really nice selection, probably the best saucisson in Paris for the price.

*Saisons*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ArTdai7792borAP9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ArTdai7792borAP9)

A bit pricey but the selection is elite

**Wine selection in a restaurant for the price**

*Gilou*

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/zbMPt9j6mijTgZMD8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zbMPt9j6mijTgZMD8)

Insane selection for the price if you are into natural wine, for example they have some Richard Leroy around for less than half of what you can find elsewhere. Food is also really good, and servings are generous.

**Ice cream**

Brigat

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/hJpnaajGai6uPFCC7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hJpnaajGai6uPFCC7)

I recently received my order from DAK.  Of the four 250g packs I ordered, one, 'The Alchemist' came as an 'espresso' roast.  Problem is I don't have an espresso machine.

I have a Kalita 185, Orea V4 Narrow, Origami Small, V60, Aeropress, French Press, and Bialetti. I also have a Mokamaster but that only gets used when guests are around. I have Cafec medium papers for the cones, and Sibarist papers with a Booster 45 for the flat brewers available.

Grinders are Fellow Ode gen 2 and Timemore CS3 Pro.

Typically I do a 20g to 300g with 45 sec bloom followed by 3 pours between 88 - 94⁰C.  

How would you brew the 'espresso' roast coffee from Dak?  I'm open to experimenting,  Thanks for your input. 

Also I haven't opened the bag yet, so not even sure what the actual roast level is for DAK espresso.

The plant has been in my office for 7-8 months, and there is not a lot of other plants around, and definitely not any new plants since mine arrived, so not sure how it got there. What is it, and how should I treat it? Just try to remove it again, or are some pesticides needed? My location is in western Norway, coastal.

My interest was piqued, and I really didn't wanna see the conversation fizzle out, so here's what I did that seemed to work magic.

I started by asking open-ended questions – totally recommend those. Instead of just saying ""cool job!"" I asked something like ""What's the most bizarre puzzle you've ever designed?"" It not only gave him room to share more, but it also showed I was genuinely interested. Oh, and don't forget to contribute something as well! I tossed in a nugget about how I love solving puzzles while sipping my favorite coffee.

Another thing I realized: callbacks are golden. If they mention something in their profile or previous messages, bring it up later. It shows you're paying attention and makes the convo more personal. It's kinda like building a small bridge every time you recall something they've told you.

So yeah, we haven't run outta things to talk about yet, and it feels pretty natural. Tbh, it's all about keeping the vibe fun and curious. Hope this helps anyone else feeling a bit meh about dating apps! 😊",6,1752138947.0,FlirtFinesse,0,1.0,False

It was a pretty chill job, nothing corporate, just a small team of six people rotating shifts. We had opening and closing duties that were clearly listed on the backroom whiteboard. It wasn’t rocket science. Just stuff like counting the drawer, vacuuming, restocking displays, and wiping down counters.

Then there was Megan. She was nice enough during the day, but when we worked closing shifts together, she would “accidentally” disappear around 7:45, and we closed at 8. Sometimes she’d be “checking something” in the stockroom, other times she’d say she was going to the bathroom and just never come back until I was already locking the door.

That meant I ended up doing all the closing duties. Every time.

I brought it up to her once, really casually, like, “Hey, I noticed I’ve been doing most of the closing stuff lately. Mind helping with the floors tonight?” She smiled and said, “Oh no! Sorry! I totally didn’t realize!” Then did the same exact thing again the next shift.

So I got a little petty in the most professional way.

I typed up a closing checklist with spaces for initials next to each task. I laminated it and taped it right next to the time clock. I didn’t single anyone out. I told the whole team it would help keep track of who did what, and our manager thought it was a great idea.

Sure enough, the first night Megan and I closed after that, she paused when she saw the list. She half-heartedly vacuumed a corner of the store, signed off, and left me with the rest. The next morning, I sent our manager a photo of the checklist, with her name next to one task and mine next to everything else.

Didn’t even have to complain. The manager pulled her aside later that week and told her closing would be rotated fairly from now on. After that, Megan either pulled her weight or swapped shifts entirely to avoid closing.

Either way, I never had to scrub the coffee counter solo again.",212,1752138943.0,coworkerstories,7,1.0,False

I was assigned to bake a cake for the cake buffet at our village festival. I wanted to make brownies and found THE famous reddit brownie recipe. 
I did a trial run today and they turned out very, very delicious. However I ran into two issues caused by the same problem: 

The recipe calls for instant espresso/coffee that is added to the chopped chocolate and cocoa powder. You add still warm, browned butter to it to melt the chocolate. However since there is little water left in the butter my instant coffee didn't dissolve. Now that the brownies are baked you can still see the little crumbs in the crust and when you eat, you get an occasional coffee burst.

Same happened with the salt that is incorporated at the very end with the flour. It just seemed to mix in, not dissolve.Everything baked evenly but it feels like the salt is not dispersed in the batter but you have Individual little salt crystals. 

So my question is, the only ""water"" this recipe contains is in the 4 eggs that get beaten with the sugar. I can just add the coffee and salt then and it should work fine... right? I neither have money nor time for another try (chocolate is e x p e n s i v e 🫠) .

If anyone with more baking experience could help I would be grateful. Thank you in advance.

It wasnt fancy, but it was near a good coffee shop and close enough to work to be able to commute.

During the second viewing, I took a bunch of photos because an expert property friend said you can always then take longer to look back, than most agents let you just wander around. I uploaded them to brickwise, which essentially gave me a mini report back... it highlighted some issues... and the cost to refurb these was £15,300. 

It flagged moisture patches around the window sills, blown double glazing windows and some small roof issues which would need work. It suggested to also get a roofer to check it out. All in all the £15,300 was the total cost to repair

I showed this report to the agent and also the seller and it ended up in me renegotiating the price down by £12,500 to cover the work, and the seller agreed. Genuinely I would not have had the confidence to do this if I hadnt had a third party tool that objectively understands it and costs.

best of luck with all of your property purchases... it can be daunting but hope it works out for and particularly in this market I hope buyers are negotiating hard... IT IS A BUYERS MARKET",0,1752138682.0,FirstTimeHomeBuyers,0,0.5,False

We were chatting about our interests and he mentioned he was an adrenaline junkie. I was like, cool, I can appreciate a thrill-seeker. 

Fast forward to planning our first date. He suggested meeting ""somewhere exciting,” and I was thinking maybe an amusement park or something. You know, casual but fun. We met up in a busy plaza, and to my surprise, he showed up wearing climbing gear... harness, helmet, the whole shebang. I was there in a cute sundress and sandals ready to hit up a café or something. 🥴

Turns out, he thought we were going bungee jumping! Apparently, somewhere between ""exciting"" and ""let’s get coffee,” wires got crossed, and I had no clue how! Imagine my shock when he said, ""Are you ready to jump?"" Took me a second to realize he was 100% serious!

We ended up laughing about it over the coffee we did get—sans adrenaline antics. He was cool, tho a bit embarrassed. Thankfully, we both realized the humor in it. Tbh, I'm still trying to figure out how I gave him the impression that I’m the bungee-jumping type... 🤔 Hopefully the next first date will be a little less adventurous, lol.",8,1752138591.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

1lw80r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldcase/comments/1lw80r1/20yr_old_vanishes_off_bridge_in_2019/,20yr old vanishes off Bridge in 2019,"There's a lot to this story. 
Rylan Miles Ihde vanished off Bridge of the God's in Casacade Locks, Oregon; May 29th 2019. He's presumed dead by suicide however his body was never recovered from the Columbia River. Theories span from ""his body got sucked up by the dam"" to ""his family aided in conspiring to fake his own death"". 
A little backstory: 
•Rylan supposedly got placed in a mandatory hold in the HR hospital. He walked out of the hospital around midnight and ran to the home of his Fiancé. She wouldn't answer the door so he runs to his father's house a quarter of a mile away. Two dogs live in this home, one very familiar with Rylan. Apparently no one woke up when he walked into the house, ""stripped his scrub cloths, grabbed a blanket and *fathers* car keys. The car was found around 4am by a concerned passersby and called 911. The blanket was found at the legde/by the car door."" -two different witness reports.-
Topic points: 
•If his body was consumed by the Bonneville dam, wouldn't there be body parts found throughout the ""months"" of searching for his body? 
•His body was never recovered however his family held a funeral August 3rd 2019 in a pubic church ""For closure."" Most of his family mocked religion but Rylan was a true believer in what Jesus meant for the world. I don't believe he ever felt comfortable to discuss this with them. I did not attend the ""Funeral"" for many reasons, one of them believing he wasn't dead. 
•There is a tiny private airport in Casacde locks, both his mother and step mother are pilots for a big airlines but have been know to fly private events. They both so happened to be out of town that day in ""two different parts of the world"". Rylan also acquired his pilots license by the age of 16.
•There was no statement made from the Toll person about Rylan in the police reports, that I've been able to find.
•The Camera facing where he would have been seen jumping was not in service due to construction on highway 14 in Washington.
•It is legal to fake your own death in the state of Oregon as long as you do not obtain someone elses identity. From what I've read.  
•His father flew the Bangkok weeks after the incident, returned for the funeral(stayed for 30 days) then made a semi permanent move in September on 2019 to Bangkok (non extradition). Still lives in Bangkok 8 months out of the year and go back home in the summers from what I've read. 

-Rylan really did struggle but it was a lot having to do with the trauma he's endured growing up. I know his parents tried but his father had some of the craziest manipulation tactics I've ever experienced.  Too much to get into here but there was a point where the Father was trying to court me despite a 33 year age gap. When he learned of mine and his sons deep love, he really did everything he could to tell both of us that we were crazy. I am still shocked that a 55 year old man can tell the 21 year old that he molested & bought into a relationship that her love for his son was wrong and unhealthy. 
BUT THATS JUST WHAT I EXPERIENCED!! 

Anyway..
•His family would go to extents to send him to high end treatment facilities (mental health based)~He would usually leave early feeling like being away from his family worked better than treatment. 
•PCT is literally right there but Ry wasn't a fan of hiking unless it involved phycodelics (he was 19.. lol who doesn't do dumb shit at that age) 
•His mom's were trying to get him to take a 23 & me to see of he had Italian decent because ""if he had Italian decent,  his whole family could get Italian passports."" I could have misunderstood this statement. Apparently, if you have an Italian passport then you don't have to get a work visa for most European countries. 
•Rylan desired an exciting life. If it wasn't short of a sifi film, he didn't want it.
•Rylans family was convinced I only wanted to marry him for his money. They've been know to sabotage conversations, dinners, trips when he wasn't following their way of life or how they thought he should be living. He eventually would cut our family dinners short because the disrespect was so loud but I was too naive to see they were being rude. 
•When I asked for his engagement ring for sentimental value, I was told that it is missing. I had access to the room he stayed in; I couldn't find a bunch of things including his ring. I did find a new jewelery holder with a tag on it and we had been joking about a place to put my jewelry that doesn't look like an alter. So apparently he had plans to gift me something. 

~ A few facts: Rylan had been known to discuss openly about wanting to end his life early. He would try to have comprehensive conversation with his loved ones about how much he suffered, how hard it was for him to be here. He would express his understanding of love but that he doesn't experience that here. So he feels constantly Gaslit but everyone around him. This and he would often discuss with me his political theories, we'd talk about buying a blimp and living out of it because buying a house was too normal. We talk about policy reform and what program we could create to help those in need. He would tip at least $30 every server we had until he found someone to bless then he would tip a few hundred. He had the privilege and he wanted to share that with others though it often came with scrutiny from his family. He had access to the world and he really thought he saw enough. He talked about want to go to raves and try Molly and fall in love with a group of strangers for a day. We talked about how the beach was the safest place we've ever felt yet it's one of the most dangerous places to be on earth. He loved coffee, good wine and fine food. I mean FINE food! He loved cooking but not as much as baking. He enjoyed the more traditional feminine duties in the relationship but he mainly loved being able to sit on his gaming PC for hours on end without someone telling him he needed to be something else to look productive. 
We talked about moving to California but how I was too scared to leave my friends and family.
~Rylan knew his soul was bigger than this world, he really did think of himself as a God a lot of the time. He would have found it ironically perfect to die on the Bidge of the God's. Poetic justice for lack of better words. 
~Rylan enjoyed an opiate bender here and there where he would usually get his drugs from his psychiatrist who was patyrolled by his mom, but I don't think his mom knew of their erangment. 
~I have zero annomisity towards his moms, sisters or aunts. His dad though... he can rot in hell for all I care. In fact, the only satisfaction that I would get out of Rylan actually being gone is the fact that his father has to live the rest of his life knowing he was ~emotionally & mentally~ a huge part of his sons death. The way his father just accepted his death and would try to convince me to do the same. Ew. I just.. anyway.

I bring this to the forum because there aren't many answers left in my community. There's a lot of ""I dunno"" and "" that's weird"" but also ""just get over it and face the fact""... for me.. the ""Facts"" just look so strange. The father has 2 close friends of the police department but the Sheriff's department handled the case (also known to sweep cases under the rug) Mom had been able to somehow dismiss criminal arsen and minor possession charges(cannabis in idaho) against Rylan granted both instances he was definitely not in control of himself. 
I can accept either outcome. Death or fake death but I need the truth. Internet sluths, do your thing. I'll answer questions as needed.

ALSO I'm not trying to start shit with his family because they will throw a C&D at me, if they don't like what they see.

1lw7y6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1lw7y6r/why_our_generation_will_have_fewer_billionaires/,Why our generation will have fewer billionaires & millionaires,"""Outliers - The story of success"" by Malcolm Gladwell states that successful people don't do it alone. Where a person comes from matters. Successful people are products of particular places and environments.

Uhuru once said that Kibaki implemented the free education policy because parents could no longer afford to educate their children. According to him, the tea, coffee, cotton, sugar, textile, among other industries in the country were quickly collapsing. 

Even with free education, corruption was skyrocketing in the country. 

The uhuru era came with COVID-19, which led to more economic deterioration. Not to mention our Parliament becoming a circus and theatre of absurdity. 

Malcolm argues that the most successful people have been given opportunities to learn and horn their skills (applying the 10,000 hours rule to mastery). He adds that success is neither mysterious nor exeptional since it is grounded in a web of advantages such as cultural legacy, inheritances, and mindsets.

What we have inherited as a generation is an opportunity to earn free education from free primary education, secondary, and helb for university). But we lack the opportunity to practice and hone our skills. We have inherited frustrations, anger, and disappointment. 
Our cultural legacy is every man for himself and God for us all. A gig economy and 24/7 internet connection with no support for capitalization. Taxes that thwart any chance of economic step up. 


Who here is practising thier degrees? Who has stable employment and a chance for career development? Who in ten years will have achieved mastery levels in their fields with support for innovation and ground breaking discoveries? 

We are surviving in a gig economy. Rampant unemployment. And extreme individuation.We believe that outhustling the Next person will make us the Next bilionnaire.

The truth is, successful people need: 
- Opportunities for development 
- A cultural legacy of success 
- A web of advantages 
- The strength and presence of mind to seize the above.

This one’s for *you*.  
You, the ones with *Biology in your notes but smut in your tabs.*  
You, the ones solving MCQs by day and dreaming about dangerous fictional men by night.

I cleared NEET this year — not just cleared, *aced it* — with a top AIR, and I'm probably headed to one of the top AIIMS. And yet, the writer in me? She's always been *alive*. She lived between the lines of every mafia fic, every dark romance, every ""*princess, be good for me*.""

During prep, I barely trusted people. But books? Fictional men who'd burn the world just to touch your thigh? *They saved me.*

So…  
I did what any feral med girl would do.

I wrote one.

A doctor.  
A mafia don.  
A filthy, slow-burn, unhinged love story.

i told him, *“i work in blood.”*  
he smirked and said, *“me too.”*  
i should’ve been scared.  
but i was wet.

Here's Chapter 1 of **Open Wide For Me, Doctor**. If you like it?

Hospitals teach you how to stop feeling.  
You get good at it, eventually—detaching from the pain, the panic, the blood.  
You have to.  
Or you'll break.

But that night... something felt different.

It was **3:07 a.m.**  
The hospital was still. Quiet. Too quiet.  
No senior on call. No backup.  
Just me.

Just a ***twenty-four-year-old intern*** in her first trauma shift, running on caffeine, adrenaline, and some version of delusion that made me think I could survive medicine.

I'd barely slept. The coffee hadn't hit yet. I was wearing my favourite oversized pink hoodie and my flared pants, stethoscope dangling loosely, lip balm smudged from habit. Still looked semi-human.

Then the ER doors slammed open.  
And ***my life cracked open with it.***

Two nurses wheeled in a patient—male, late twenties or early thirties maybe, vitals dipping. Blood soaked through his crisp black shirt like someone had painted him with violence.  
But it wasn't the blood that made me pause.

It was the *calm.*

He wasn't panicking.  
He wasn't begging.  
He was *watching.*

And when I moved closer, I swear his eyes pinned me in place.

**""GSW to the chest and shoulder. Lost a lot of blood on the way in,""** the nurse reported.

I glanced at him fully now.  
Tall. Built like sin.  
Tattoos peeked from beneath his torn sleeve.  
Sharp jaw, darker stubble, high cheekbones, lips set in something between a smirk and a dare.

He didn't even blink.

""Who the hell smiles with two bullet wounds?"" I muttered, mostly to myself.

But of course, he heard.

His eyes—midnight and merciless—opened slowly.  
And he *smiled wider.*

""People who've had worse,"" he rasped, voice all gravel and threat.

I didn't blink. Didn't smile back.  
**""Name?""** I asked as I prepped the line.

""Aarav,"" he said simply.  
Then, after a heartbeat:  
""Aarav Malhotra.""

The air shifted.

I knew that name.  
Anyone with a pulse in this city knew that name.

He was money and power and shadow.  
Rumored to run more than just a business.  
A ghost in expensive suits.  
A myth dressed like a man.

And he was bleeding out on *my* table.

No time for backup. No time to call senior.  
Just me, a tray full of tools, and ***him.***

A chill slid down my spine, one that had nothing to do with the temperature.  
And everything to do with the way he was watching me like *he'd seen me before.*

""You afraid?"" he asked.

His voice was low. Intimate. Like we were alone. Like he didn't have ***two bullets*** inside him.

I leaned down, close enough to smell blood and cologne—dark, woodsy, expensive.

I met his eyes and whispered,  
**""Of blood? Never. I work in it.""**

And he smiled again. Slower this time.  
Like I had just said something *he'd been waiting his whole life to hear.*

**""So do I.""**

Silence fell.  
Heavy. Thick. Intoxicating.

The kind that doesn't ask for attention—it demands it.

He watched me clean his chest, unflinching.  
He didn't move when I gloved up, when I prepped the needle, when I numbed the site.  
Not even when I grabbed the scalpel with shaking fingers and whispered ***my first incision ever.***

Not even when ***he should've passed out.***

Because somewhere between ***blood and blade,***  
He whispered,

""You're shaking.""

""I'm not.""

""You are.""

And then—his voice dropped.

*""It's okay, princess.""*  
*""Ruin me if you can.""*

That was the moment.

Right there.

The moment I stopped being a doctor.

The moment I forgot this was real.

Because it didn't feel like I was saving him.

***He was breaking me.***

The sutures slipped through my fingers, tight and clean.  
He bled. I stitched.  
Our eyes never left each other.

And with every knot I tied, with every drop I cleaned, I realized—

***This was the man I was going to let ruin me.***  
Not just ***fuck me.***  
Not just ***wreck me.***  
But *destroy* me in ways I'd only read about in books I'd hidden beneath textbooks.

And deep in my chest, I knew  


This was the beginning.  
Of something cold.  
Something hot.  
Something that would set fire to everything I thought I could control.

And it started with a man bleeding on my table.

Over three hours, cityscapes melted into emerald pastures outside the window. With ocean sounds playing through my headphones, I scrolled through photos of Rhossili Bay – that Lonely Planet crowned stretch of cliff backed coastline that had lured me into my first proper solo adventure.

The Journey:
1.  London Paddington → Swansea: Direct train, approx. 3h (Advance ticket: £35)
2.  Swansea Station → Bus Station: 10 min walk to city centre’s Quadrant Bus Station
3.  Bus 118 → Rhossili: 1 hour ride through Gower’s sheep dotted hills (£4.50 single)

When the bus rolled into the terminus, salt laced wind rushed through the windows. My breath caught at the cliff top view: three miles of golden sand ribboned below, Atlantic waves exploding against rocks a hundred metres down. Fluffy sheep – their fleece turned to clouds by the sun – grazed on gorse beside the coastal path. Hiking down in trusty trainers (mind the edge!), each step felt like walking into a David Attenborough documentary.

Lunch was a thrifty picnic on a bench by the village shop: a Welsh cheddar sandwich from Swansea Market (£3.50) with local apples, followed by a heavenly sea salt caramel cone from Joe’s Ice Cream (£2.50). As tourists sipped wine at The Bay Bistro, I smugly calculated my £20 saving – the next day's Tate entry sorted. Student budgeting: making every quid count.

Low tide unveiled the path to Worm’s Head. Bare feet met astonishingly fine sand – nothing like Britain’s usual pebbly shores. Wading across the exposed seabed toward the dragonshaped island, tiny crabs scuttled over barnacled rocks. A distant shout made me turn: white foam was racing toward the causeway! I sprinted back, trainers in hand, heart drumming. Nearly became a reallife castaway – Robinson Crusoe vibes unintended!

Back in Swansea for the evening, neon lights glowed at the indoor market. At the “Gower Power” stall, a tenner bought a mountain of mussels and chips (£10). Squashed at a communal table, sharing chili sauce with Welsh students, my phone buzzed: “Those cliff sheep on your Insta! Take me next time??” Grinning, I scooped up plump mussels as Swansea Bay’s twilight waves shimmered – still hearing Rhossili’s wild chorus in my ears.

On the night train back to London, salt lingered on my skin. Eyes closed, I replayed clifftop moments when the wind stole my whispered thought:
> “Time suspends itself here. Solitude is freedom’s quiet gift.”

Cost Breakdown (Student Edition):
   Transport: Train £35 + Bus £9 = £44
   Food: Brekkie £6.50 + Lunch £6 + Dinner £10 = £22.50

I am considering reading through the ~700 page document that is free to view and download on Internet Archive, and Scribd. 
It may take me a while, and I may skim some areas based upon my understanding, but I'd like to get through this. 

So my first question:
Has anyone here read this?

Next: 
Is anyone else interested in tackling this beast?

It looks like an understanding of some Hebrew would be helpful, but the author states it is not required. A line in the prologue says: Hebrew is as Greek as Homer is Greek! (My paraphrase)

The PDF linked above has some markings. Perhaps the Scribd version is better. I already used my free trial to download our Greek Intensive course book 😉

I'm committed to learning Greek, but I'd like some reinforcement for when the monists come bashing & thrashing around.
If I read this and the theoretical monist/skeptic reads it, I'd be willing to discuss with them.

I'll do my homework, will they? 
I doubt it.

It may be awhile, but I'll provide feedback here, if anyone is interested. Or better yet, join me and we can discuss it together!
I'm a coffee drinker. I'll make a pot (or multiple) and we can chat about it :):)

Tonight I read 27 pages on the PDF:
Preface
Prologue (perhaps a mis-ordered scan in here, or a missing page)
Chpt 1: Hebrew and the Hebrews

Summaries:
The Preface is by Saul Levin. 
A bit dry and these pages contain many marks by a previous owner. Decent content but quite academic. Many terms I am not thoroughly familiar with. 

Prologue by the author. 
Yehuda was a lawyer. He briefly, but adequately, explains his purpose for writing the work, his unsuccessful attempts to gain help, and ultimately that he finished it alone. He is comprehendible. 

Chapter 1: Hebrew and the Hebrews.
The author relates some basic history of the people group in review. He mentions the different geographical groups of the area and gives examples from the biblical books themselves, that there is evidence of large interactions between populations. 

*Note 1: Josephus is mentioned. If I only read the name, does that still mean an angel farts in a babies face, or does it have to be said out loud?

**Note 2: There is a list of 17 conclusions at the end of this chapter. They themselves are compelling enough that this is a worthy effort, hence my post.

By placing this link, and this post, I am publicly committing to this project, even if it's only an exercise of and for my own enlightenment.
I am using you all as accountability or leverage. Also, this is the only place I can share my excitement if I find something amazing! 

For who else understands the importance of this implication? 
I know I do, based on Hillman's work alone. Am in looking to validate Hillman's hypothesis which I've taken as my own? 
Yes. 
Am I willing to let a dead man speak to me about his 30 years of work and his 17 conclusions ?
Yes.

I would like to be able to articulate accurately this concept to those I will encounter outside our congregation.

For backstory: I (25) have lived with my bf (27) for 3 years now. At first we lived with my dad (52), who got very lazy about keeping house after my mom passed away and rarely ever did his share of the chores. We're all adults, and I got sick of keeping up after two other people and would often let shit go and pile up from time to time before getting even more tired of the mess and cleaning everything in a frenzy. 

I begged both my dad and bf to maintain things each time, and they'd be good about it for a day or two before the cycle repeated. We had 5 dogs who we took in from friends and others over the last 15 years, and they all had various behavioral issues. The most glaring of which was lack of housebreaking. There would be puddles of pee on the floor constantly, and if I wasnt the one to immediately swiffer them up, they would sit there and eventually dry. I also tried several times to get everyone on the same page about retraining the dogs, but nobody else ever wanted to put in the work to be consistent and you cannot train one dog let alone 5 without consistency. 

I first began to question things this one time I snapped at bf and told him he needed to take the swiffer for a lap around the kitchen and livingroom, which he did, but he missed several spots and claimed that he just didnt see them. When I swiffer, I make a point to check the entire surface area, especially little nooks and crannies, but he flat out left spots in plain sight. 

Another time I asked him to wash a utensil i needed while I kept an eye on what I was cooking, and he handed it to me still with bits of old food stuck to it, again claiming that he thought he got them all. 

I once got tired of being the only one emptying the bathroom trash and replacing the toilet paper, so I left that too. A month passed and the empty paper rolls piled up and out of the trash can about a foot and a half high. I again snapped and asked bf why he hadnt done anything about it. This caused the argument of all arguments. He said he simply didnt notice, even though he was actively contributing to the pile whenever a roll would run out, because he just didnt look at the trash while he was in there. I asked how he could possibly not see it and he blamed adhd and said that he didnt go in with the explicit purpose of taking out the trash so he just ignored it as if it didnt exist to him. Wasnt even on his radar. I'll admit im still extremely skeptical about that particular example. 

We eventually moved out of my dads house and bf promised me he'd be better about picking up after the dogs (only took 2 of the 5 with us) purely because he would be more motivated to stay on top of it in a place of his own. This made me roll my eyes a bit, but I tried to be optimistic. Well, nothing has really changed. He has a puppy that poops all over the place and tries to eat it, so there are crumbs of it scattered everywhere. This man walks around barefoot and sometimes gets them stuck to his feet and doesnt notice until he wants me to give him a massage and I tell him he needs to clean them first. Once again, if i dont pick it up, there it stays. When i do ask him to pick it up, he NEVER gets it all, and if i point out spots he missed, he gets huffy and says he thought he got everything. 

I ask him to take out the trash, which we agreed when we moved would be the one chore that was solely his responsibility, and he will tell me he ""was going to"" only to leave it for days and then complain when the new bag is immediately full again due to the backup. He also says that when he's nerving himself up to do something and then i make a point of asking him to, he suddenly loses all motivation to do it and has to start over. He also claims this stems from childhood trauma and says that his parents were neglectful and never taught him how to do basic life shit. 

I cannot ask him to do dishes because I dont trust that they will come out clean even when I show him exactly how to do it. He refuses to even use the dishwasher because he ""prefers to wash them by hand"" but we do not have the counterspace to allow the entire pileup of dishes to dry. 

He also has a habit of leaving trash everywhere. Plastic sleeves from microwave foods, empty milk jugs, water bottles with only a sip taken out of them all accumulating on the coffee table, chip bags, doordash bags, empty boxes of mac and cheese because that and oven pizzas are the only things he will cook without me asking. 

I'm currently sick with a cold for the last 3 days, having to beg him to walk both dogs because im too dizzy to stand for long stretches. Every dish in my house is dirty, there is dog poop on the floor of his room because he was in there gaming and napping on and off all day and didnt walk the dogs unless i was awake to explicitly ask him to. He doesn't do anything unprompted and when I do ask he will put it off until I nag, and I still have to go back behind him and check that he did it right. I am at the end of my rope, but I also feel guilty for being so fed up because I cant tell how much of it is genuinely caused by the adhd and how much is just him not wanting to contribute to the household. We both work full-time in the exact same job, I feel I shouldnt have to cook and clean for two people and take care of the dogs all on my own on top of that.",2,1752136679.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

It’s often referred to as a “loophole” because it feels indulgent (creamy, sweet, satisfying) but is actually structured to minimize blood sugar spikes and support fat-burning throughout the day. It's popular in intermittent fasting and low-carb circles.

A typical version of the **Coffee Loophole** includes:

* **1 cup of hot brewed coffee** (your favorite roast)
* **1 scoop of protein powder** (vanilla or chocolate works well)
* **1 tsp MCT oil or coconut oil**
* **A splash of unsweetened almond milk**
* **Optional: cinnamon or stevia for sweetness**

Just blend everything together until smooth and frothy. The result is a creamy, energizing drink that can even replace breakfast on some days.

1lw7i1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/1lw7i1s/glm_with_distance_decay/,GLM with distance decay,"Hello everyone!

I’m tasked with creating a model to understand how people are impacted based on distance to two types of locations. For our purpose, let us assume location A is a coffee shop and location B a study center. And we want to estimate the number of visits to either location. 

The coffee shops are always open and anyone can simply walk in. The study center is less flexible and results in lower utilization.

I want to understand how the population living near one of these or both are impacted by distance. For instance, people living near the coffee shop might utilize it in greater extend since one can simply walk in but as distance increase, the utilization drops quickly. However, the study center have less utilization even for people living near it but distance does not have the same impact since those who want to visit the study center are willing to travel further. But living near both does not add any additional value (or very slim) in comparison to only living near the coffee shop. 

The goal in the end would be to be able to extract a matrix with dimensions as distance to either type of location. It would display the decay in percentage, for instance how living near both types of locations has a decay of 0% but living X and Y km away results in decay of 56%.

In an ideal world, the distance to either location would at some point X km converge where it no longer matters which is closer since both create the same rate of visits by the population. 

Data
- We are dealing with count data (eg number of visits).
- We have two types of locations and are interested in understanding how a regions/populations distance to these two are impacted.
- We have data for 100 coffee shops and 100 study centers across an entire country. 


My approaches:
I tried fitting a negative binomial to our count data and incorporating features for the distance such as min distance to either location, if the nearest location was a coffee shop and the absolute difference in distance between the nearest two location types. 

However, the data has a lot of variability. It can be hard to ensure the correct variation is explained by variables of the customer type rather than the distance impact.

But since we know the rate of visits must decay with distance, it would be nice to force the model to learn a exponential decay for distance. But then again, we have two types of distances and we need to ensure going in either direction results in a decay even if one direction impacts more than the other. 

How would I go about trying to fit a negative binomial but forcing the model to learn the decay restrictions?

Thanks for any tips or feedback!

I had ordered hario v60 from amazon.  
The listing mentions hario v60.   
Prod description mentions hario v60.   
The seller is TGL co.   
They shipped their own product.

I raised a replacement after the amazon support executive(who was very hard to get on a call) assured me I’d get correct product if i place a replacement

Guess what!!

These TGL Co. m*therfuckers decided to ship the same shitty TGL Co. V60 instead of the original hario.

I am so done with this bs man,
This was a very shitty experience to go through and amazon shamelessly offers me a refund after wasting my time TWICE.

I was so excited to get my first v60 and this shit is just delaying that experience for no valid reason.

I am not even able to get the support executive now using the method i used last time🥲.

Please check who your sellers are before you place your orders.

Please suggest me some aggregator platforms where i can order coffee equipments from.

I beat the game last year and really enjoyed it, and am in the process of replaying it - which is something I almost never do nowadays. 

I've read a lot of discussion both here and in other places about aspects of the game and I wanted to discuss certain aspects that are quite contentious

* >!Kasane trying to kill Yuito (aka why don't they just talk??)!<
* >!Both sides meeting up at Musubi's constantly!<
* >!Yuito forgiving Kasane very quickly.!<

>!These are highlighted by many as problems with the story. I personally don't think they are.!<

>!Kasane trying to kill Yuito works. It's strange if you've only played Yuito's route since you only find out the reason second-hand, but playing Kasane's puts it into perspective better. She saw the ruined future, Yuito alone and blinded, clearly hating the life he ended up leading and eventually taking his own life. So when she sees him in the present day and realises that with his father's death the ruined future is beginning to happen, her immediately trying to kill him works for me. !<

>!First attempt was spur of the moment. Second was premeditated and also works. She gets hard evidence that Yuito's power is causing the Kunad gate to grow, sets out to kill him. It's a very cold move but what I like is that her team are openly opposed to it and chew her out later. That's one of my favourite scenes in the game and highlights why Shiden's character is great. It also addresses the ""Why don't they just talk"" complaint - Kasane didn't think her own team would get her reasonings, so it stands to reason she believed Yuito wouldn't get it either. And even then it's hard to say ""I met you in the future and he told me to kill you"". And all that leads into the third attempt where Kasane Platoon isn't really trying to kill him, they're just putting on a show for Seiran. !<

>!Then there's the bond episodes where opposing sides are constantly meeting up for coffee or errands or whatever. It is certainly a bit strange but I think it works. The OSF are fundamentally a PvE army. The only time they fight other psionics is for training and almost never to kill (maybe an in-universe reason why human bosses are such difficulty spikes). The only reason Yuito and Kasane platoon are opposing each other is pure chance, as the battle lines were drawn based on who the red strings transported to the future. !<

>!So it stands to reason that they don't hate each other. They're co-workers! Friends! They've known each other for years. Some of them are against New Himuka/Seiran for various reasons but they really don't hate their fellow OSF. It's only personal for Kasane who has a vested interest in killing Yuito and protecting Naomi, and she blocks him immediately! And on her end she's constantly trying to poach Yuito platoon members which is really entertaining.!<

>!So that works for me and leads into point three.!<

>!Yuito in the future never truly believed Kasane killed his father, and current Yuito knows there's a reason she's not confirming or denying it. By the time he meets her at Hieno and she explains her reasoning, she's already saved him from BABE. I think it works that he's quick to accept her reasoning. Yuito overall has a favourable view of Kasane due to her saving him as a child which also helped. I also think fundamentally Yuito is sort of just a nice dude, which ties into why he was so willing to meet with Kasane Platoon members at Misubis. !<

>!But yeah. Just wanted to get that out there. The game is quite niche and a bit old so it's hard to find current discussion, might as well make my own, right? !<",5,1752135763.0,ScarletNexus,3,0.86,False

They say the camera never lies—but I say it flirts, teases, and sometimes tells just the right kind of fib. I’m the guy behind the lens, chasing beauty in all its messy, unexpected glory. I live for those in-between moments—the smirk before the laugh, the glance that says everything, the kind of light that makes skin glow like it’s telling secrets.

Outside the frame? I’m your classic Irish rogue—tattooed, music loud enough to shake the walls, book in hand (probably with a half-drunk coffee beside it), and always up for an adventure, especially the kind that starts with “I probably shouldn’t…” and ends with a story worth retelling.

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.

I'm currently on an exchange program for two weeks here in Croatia (Zagreb, more precisely), and I just recovered from a nasty cold (or maybe it was a karma hangover lol). I've been here for a few days now, and I'm starting to feel like a human again, so I'm planning a short trip this weekend and also thinking about a bigger roadtrip next week when I get more days off.

So here's the thing:

* For this weekend, I'm looking for a nice place to chill, maybe by the sea or some small town with cute old buildings and food. I'm still a bit tired so nothing too crazy. I'm also considering taking a bus and getting to know another country nearby, maybe Bosnia or Slovenia? Any ideas?
* For next week, I’m thinking about renting a car and doing a small Balkan loop. Like... from Croatia down through Bosnia, maybe Montenegro, Albania, and (if not too crazy) Greece??  (i'll have like 10 days)

But I have no idea if that’s possible or stupid. How are the borders these days? Is it easy to cross between these countries with a EU passport? Do I need insurance or any specific documents? And do the rent-a-car companies allow you to cross borders like that?

Also, any tips for hidden gems, beautiful stops, weird towns, good food, or just peaceful places with water and cats are more than welcome.

Thanks in advance! And if anyone is around Zagreb and wants to share a coffee or a glass of wine, let me know :)",2,1752135332.0,Europetravel,0,1.0,False
1lw7af7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1lw7af7/my_sweet_dream/,My sweet dream,"At night I had a dream:
Dasha was taking Vika to the gym in my car. When they arrived, I got behind the wheel of my car and it turned out that I was riding an electric scooter. It was raining outside and when I turned on the road, I fell. My clothes quickly soaked with water from the road and one side of my clothes was completely wet.
But I didn't feel the cold, although it was autumn outside.
At the intersection, a woman was riding a bicycle and a small dog was barking at her. A man was driving past, he drove the dog away from the woman and this dog jumped onto my scooter and then we rode together.
I was riding up a strange street, it looked beautiful: stone steps, greenery grew on the fences on the sides.
On the way, I met a girl, she was with a guy. And I immediately understood that this was her boyfriend. I don't remember how she injured her finger, but for some reason I helped her treat it. We were walking up the stairs and it turned out that she lives in one of these houses.
She stopped on the porch of her house, and I wanted to continue my journey. But she held out her finger and there was a question in her eyes: ""Are you going to leave me with a pain in my finger?""
I didn't know how to react?! Looking at the wound, it seemed as if she had somehow received a burn. I touched her hand, looked at her finger and the first thing that came to my mind was to blow on the lesion. It's a burn, so the cold should help it, so you need to blow.
When I finished my manipulation, I looked into her eyes. But now I saw a call there to ""continue treatment""
I didn't know what else I could do in this situation?! For some reason I wanted to kiss her finger (as in childhood when I got some kind of injury, my mother always kissed me and said that it would heal soon. At that moment I felt that I was loved)
She looked at me with surprise, but a smile played on her lips. Looking into her eyes, I wanted to show tenderness and care for her. But we don’t even know this girl??
At some point I felt that I should continue my journey (I don’t know where I was going, but I was going somewhere?!)
She is standing near her house, and I was going somewhere. This means that our paths should diverge now. I tried to take a step forward, but she stood in my way. Our eyes met and there again the question “Are you just going to leave like that?”
I leaned over to kiss her on the cheek, but she didn’t turn her head very much and my kiss fell on the corner of her lips. Her eyes met mine and she looked... in love... with me.
We stood very close and I hugged her waist, I gently touched her hips, controlling my movements I enjoyed this closeness.
Looking into her eyes I leaned towards her, our lips touched, it was a gentle, uncertain, calm kiss. With every second this kiss turned into a breath, just as uncontrolled, natural, calm, as if our lives depended on it.
She uttered the first words: ""Mi piace il tuo bacio"" It seems it was Italian.
I could only say: ""I don't speak your language. I'm Ukrainian.""
Her eyes continued to look at me, there was so much tenderness in them, I had long forgotten what it was like to look into such eyes?!
She, remembering the words, slowly, said ""I can... speak Ukrainian... I studied in Ukraine. I like... to feel your kiss""
I could only stand and smile at her. She was so cute: she had black hair. Her skin was tanned. And her eyes... beautiful, too beautiful to describe.
The next second, my friend and I were sitting on the upper deck of the ship. My friend suggested we go down for coffee. I don't know why we were on that ship. When we started to leave the deck, after coffee, the same eyes looked at me through the glass... They were so sincere that if I saw them in reality, I think I wouldn't be able to take my eyes off them. Never...
I went up to her and she asked ""Are you going to leave like this? And I'll never see you again?""
With all the tenderness in me, I touched her wrist, took her fingers in my hand, raised them to my lips. I kissed her wrist. And looking into her eyes I said ""I will love you with all my heart for as long as you allow. And now I'm just going to buy coffee""
She smiled. I have no idea where I found the strength to take my eyes off her, but as I headed for the exit I felt her gaze on me.
Looking into her eyes the whole world ceased to exist. There was only her and me...
