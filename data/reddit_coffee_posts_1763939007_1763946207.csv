I felt like you were struggling with your sexuality after the catfish persona admitted some things and I tried to be that person who was non judgmental.  And then you went and proved yourself except you didn’t. But you did say you were using things on yourself which honestly marked the end for me regardless of who it was. 

It made retrospective sense because you were admitting all these things to me including your bisexuality.

Hey, I live in Port Moody and I’m hoping to make a good friendship. I am interested in reading, coffee, hiking, long distance travel, poetry, talking about philosophy and long walks.

I usually keep to myself but lately I’ve found myself wanting company that is fulfilling to my mental and emotional faculties. I am looking to have deep conversations and good dinners with someone mature and polite. I tend to be soft spoken and introverted. I do not like loud people and want to be around someone soft spoken but emotionally mature and kind to themselves and others. I am pretty independent and spend a lot of time by myself but I’m actively looking for my match (someone that is worth my time, energy and efforts).

Also i know everyone is different, but i was 217 ish at the start of Reta. I am muscular and a tad fluffy even though the Army says I'm obese. I can run a sub 36 5 mile and am very satisfied with my lifts in the gym so I'm not out of shape. I started Reta mostly as a bit of a body recomp because I'm strongly considering a bodybuilding show in April and i have always had issues getting down into the low BF percentages. 

I have been running 2.5 Reta pinned twice a week (M/Th) for about 3 weeks now. 

I know a few people who saw weight flying off the first week, and some who were down 10-12 lbs in the first two. My goal is to get to 190-195 lbs but over the first 3 weeks i have only gotten down to 215 lbs as of today, and although im not expecting anything crazy yet i also have no noticeable visual changes. In my experience i can fluctuate down to 215 if i take the right post coffee 💩 so im wondering if im just being impatient or if I should start titrating up since there isn't much going on. 

In full transparency, I am active duty military so my eating and sleeping habits are terrible (in the sense that before Reta i would sometimes forget to eat throughout much of the day) and then cram something when i realized i was starving. Since starting Reta i definitely notice that food is never on my mind, i typically don't ever get the starving feeling i normally do midway through the day and i don't necessarily have too many cravings. So i know it's doing something. But at the moment i am also trying to eat more consistently so i can limit any drastic muscle loss. 

Thoughts or Suggestions from those with success in a similar aspect would be greatly appreciated.

1p537kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p537kw/my_roommate_25f_is_dating_a_40m_homeless_jobless/,"My roommate (25F) is ""dating"" a (40M) homeless, jobless, self-proclaimed thug and I (25F) want to kick him out. AITA?","Hold your bridges, because this is a long one.  About a year ago, my BFF and I got our first apartment together in the city.  Even though I was excited to start this new chapter in my life, I knew we weren't going to be great roommates.  I would argue she is my soul mate and can get through hard times together.  However, we are very alike in some areas, and complete opposite on other areas.  So some of the things I do drives her nuts, like not telling her where I was going if I went on a date, quitting a job without another job lined up, and being too honest at times.  I can understand why she would be upset and I am learning from my mistakes.  Some of the things that she does that drive me nuts is not unclogging the toilet for me to do, not going to work if she didn't feel like it, allowing people to sleep in my bed if I'm not there, making our dog wait for so long to go to the bathroom because she ""needs"" to do other things first (heat up her food, charge whatever she needs charged, etc.), and of course, running around with a thug.
Now to get to the issue.  A few months back, me and my roommate were drinking and thought it would be nice to watch the stars.  We walked out of our apartment and laid on the sidewalk, talking.  Then comes along a man, we'll call him John, and starts striking up a conversation.  It wasn't a bad convo and we actually liked John's energy.  He seemed nice, but being in the f****** ghetto, my guard is always up.  After that first meeting, those two were almost inseparable.  She invited him over almost every night.  At first, I didnt think much of it, but I was worried since he claims to be a thug that other people would see him walking into our apartment and come after us.  And that's not a crazy thought.  A guy shot up an apartment due to the same exact same reason.  An issue I personally have is I am not emotionally invested in this friendship with John, but my roommate is.  She would walk around with him at night and he would get her drugs if she asked.  I told her it worries me, but she is a grown woman and will do what she pleases, but it's still my problem since he keeps coming back.  One day, he said he has some thugs looking for him, and not in the ""lets grab a cup of coffee and talk about our differences"" way.  I dropped them off at a concert and waited for them to call for a ride again.  But that never happened.  The next morning, I see her and thought ""how did you get back?  Uber?  Bus?""  Nope.  They decided to walk for miles and miles through the neighborhoods that wanted to ""chat"" with John.  I was furious.  What do you mean he put you through that danger???  Why would HE do that?  HOWEVER, considering I know my roommate better than her own creator, I know she has a tendency to get what she wants and it doesn't matter if she gets hurt.  In other words, self-sabotage. She also has a tendency to become like her boyfriend in some ways.  For example, if her boyfriend is lazy, she will be lazy.  I'm not trying to sound rude, but I've seen it over and over.  Now that she's involved with a homeless, jobless dude, I am more than concerned she will become the same.  Now to be perfectly clear, I have no problem with homeless people at all.  But to know she takes on after her boyfriends, I'm not just worried, I'm involved.  A little over a week ago, she decided she didn't want to go to work, and that she'll go back whenever she feels like it.  Now rent STILL hasn't been paid and she continues to buy (or steal) unnecessary things.
About a week ago, we had an intense argument about her not going to work, spending money where it shouldn't be spent, and of course, John.  I have multiple questions for John.  I have heard many things from my roommate and John himself that are questionable.  I said I needed to speak with him, but he didn't want to come out of my roommates room because he was tired.  Furious, I said he needs to come out and talk because he has no right to control how things go considering he's a guest.  My roommate told me to drop it, but I couldn't.  I wanted to kick him out.  I wanted to remind him that this was not his house.  He doesn't pay bills, he steals from malls and hands out items as gifts, and is far from not being a thug anymore.  I do not want him in my house.  At this point, me and my roommate are not talking.  I told her numerous times how uncomfortable I am with having him in the house, but I'm more uncomfortable if she leaves the house at night with him.  I have to remind myself that I'm not her mother and I need to care less.
My boyfriend is the only person I can talk to about these things.  Being the great guy he is, he either agrees or disagrees.  He keeps me in check and doesn't always choose my side.  I have my boyfriend on my right saying that I have every right to be upset with John not getting up, and on my left is my roommate saying John doesn't have to.  I have never been more confused on if I'm being dramatic or if I was in the right.  If I'm the homeowner, do I not get the right to make guests leave?  I explained to my roommate if she ever had a problem with my boyfriend while he's at the house, she should be able to speak with him whenever she needs to.  Big or small.  If he refuses, he's in some serious trouble.  Was I in the right to get upset over this?  Everything has been going on for a long time, so I don't know how to feel anymore.  I need some advice.  I am an honest person and I would appreciate some honest opinions.  AITA?",1,1763945509.0,AITAH,11,0.67,False

A lot of the dorms here are apartment style, so we each have our own bedroom, share a bathroom with only one other person, have a kitchen, all that jazz.

For context, I bought a trashcan for the kitchen for us to share, but I don’t use that one anymore since my roommates fill it up rather quickly and I don’t want to take out someone else’s trash. I also have a light trap that catches flies. Well, recently, I noticed that the light trap has been filling up with flies rather quickly.

I was going to figure out where the source has been coming from, but as I went to throw out the old fly trap cartridge, I opened the trash can to find a SWARM of flies inside. Literally flew out right at me. Turns out, they haven’t been taking out their trash as often as they should. Also, they left a cup of coffee on the table and let it mold. It’s been sitting there for weeks.

Later, my roommate came back and I confronted him about the infestation, but he dismissed me and went straight to his bedroom.

At this point I had enough, and I made a group chat and let them know that since it’s their trash, one of them needed to take out the garbage and clean out the can, as well as getting rid of the moldy coffee today or tomorrow since the flies made their way to the fridge. I didn’t think it was fair for me to clean up someone else’s mess.

Then one of the roommates hit me with “we were already planning on a clean before Thanksgiving Break” and I was about to say that this couldn’t wait any longer, but then the other roommate said they would do it.

I told my mom this story, and she kind of implied I should’ve just cleaned it up from the get go. I don’t know, I just don’t think it’s fair that I should be obligated to clean up a kitchen I don’t use and fix a fly infestation I didn’t create.

1p534ty,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p534ty,Far right narrative pipeline in Bristol groups,"I’ve been doing a bit of personal research into one of the local “patriot” groups that’s been involved in endorsing or even organising the protests outside hotels housing asylum seeker families. I wanted to understand how these groups talk and organise behind the scenes. I don’t want to sow division here but i want to increase people’s understanding of how organisers seem to use carefully curated content to normalise extreme ideas, but without incriminating themselves. 

Essentially I’ve been noticing a pattern where organisers are careful to avoid leading with anything extreme, which seems to be about building engagement and funnelling people towards attendance at protests under the guise of some sort of vague patriotic idea, even though clearly the undercurrent in the group and the focus of these protests is around dislike of asylum seekers and immigrants in general. I’m not naming individuals, but I think it’s important to talk about the narrative pipeline works because it’s quite eye-opening.

After the recent hotel protest, organisers posted a very polished, clearly-ChatGPT-written message full of emojis, “thank you patriots,” emphasis on “discipline,” “maturity,” “working with the police,” and lots of mentions of, “family, community, supporters, gratitude.” The tone is borderline wholesome and you could almost mistake it for being written by harmless volunteers organising a village fête. There’s no mention that the protest targeted families or asylum seekers or even really what the protest was about, even though it’s clearly written by a key organiser.

But when you look at the member posts circulating in these groups, they are much more overtly hostile and betray the real function of these online spaces. Something recently shared by a member was a meme with “All I Want For Christmas Is MASS DEPORTATIONS”. Another meme I’ve seen is one saying saying “don’t be afraid of being called far-right, these days far-right just means NORMAL”. This one was wild to me, it is a literal attempt to change the definition of ‘far right’ to de-stigmatise the extremity of these views, despite the generalised hostility and dehumanising language many of them are clearly showing. And then there’s often a load of links to YouTube grifter/‘auditer’ inflammatory and one sided sensationalist content from protests doing the rounds.
I was really interested in the contrast between the tone of organisers on the ‘top layer’ being very cautious about not using overtly hateful language, probably in order to avoid censoring or blame, which is very obviously contrasted against this undercurrent of much more explicitly discriminatory content shared by group members. 

You can also see how admins of group like this “flip” the groups name from being overtly anti immigration to focussed on a more benign “national strike” type thing and back again (screenshot included). I found this quite interesting in how deceptive it is.  

What stood out to me is how strategic it all seems, with the organisers staying clean and “community minded” whilst members do all the explicit anti-immigration, far-right meme sharing. So essentially the organiser never endorses the extremes, but conveniently never moderates or discourages them either.

It’s an interesting pipeline of surface narrative masquerading as friendly and cheerful (even though they have clearly been involved in coordinating a protest that amounts to the harassment of asylum seeker families), and then much harsher content being permitted to circulate underneath. 

Comically organisers are now starting to use “buy me a coffee” or GoFundMe pages, apparently the latter is to fund things for homeless people in Bristol although I’d be very interested to know whether there is any transparency about donations and where they will end up. Certainly seems like they feel they have built enough momentum now to start making money off their ventures.

Bristol’s got a solid anti‑racist community, and I think most people would be pretty concerned by how these far right organisers are operating so I wanted to share some of what I have discovered, for educational purposes as well as awareness raising. Also think it’s important not to increase division, and I think one way to prevent this is to understand how people may be getting sucked into this way of thinking by this curation of content on organisers’ parts. As a community we need to be informed about how this type of messaging is spreading. Protests like the one on 15th are being orchestrated by a handful of far‑right grifters using local fb groups to generate outrage and farm engagement to build momentum for discrimination against vulnerable people. 

Would love go have an open conversation about how we can be vigilant about these things whilst also fostering community resilience and strengthening bristols response to racist narratives.

1p534ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p534ob/i_lost_my_first_love/,I lost my first love,"(I used AI to help me fix my grammar so it’s easier for you guys to read, but everything here is fully my own words and my own story.)

Hi, it’s my first time posting here. First of all, I’m really happy that I get to read posts here knowing that I’m not alone, and a lot of people are going through the same thing. I lost my first love last September. It was one of the heaviest and most painful experiences I’ve ever encountered. We’d been together for almost 6 years and God knows how much we loved each other.

During those 6 years, we were long distance for almost 2 years, but before that we were almost inseparable — we were together most of the time. We were perfect. My family adores her and her family didn’t have any problems with us. I would even take care of her grandparents when she wasn’t around. I was there for her as she was always there for me. We were each other’s best friends. We shared secrets. We had this version of ourselves that no one else knew, not even our parents.

But when she moved out of the country to study and eventually settle there, that’s when things started. She started earning a lot, which I was very happy for, but during those times I was having the hardest time maintaining my business. For months, I didn’t earn anything, not even break even. We almost broke up that time because she told me she fell out of love with me and that she outgrew me — which was true. After I begged and asked for compromises, things got better.

Fast forward to January: I decided to move out and work for my sister on an island where I could establish myself. I started earning enough money to somehow pay my loans and save money to move with her. That was my deal with my sister — that I’d only move to the island so I could save and find a career that could help me go to her country.

I’m not gonna lie, at first I was having the best time of my life. I’m in my 20s and I was on an island people from around the world would travel to. I met people from everywhere, but I never cheated on her. I was just distracted from my goal. Partying after work, hanging out with friends, but I always found time for her. I always called her and made sure I spent time with her every day.

We were okay with our setup… or so I thought.

During that long-distance period, her love language suddenly changed. She said she found it hard to be sweet anymore and all we had was our routine. She was supposed to go home last August but her grandfather passed away, so she went home in July. I quickly went back too because I wanted to be there for her during her lowest.

When I first saw her again, it was amazing. I was out of words. I couldn’t even kiss her. She was so beautiful, I even asked myself if she was really my girlfriend. I was with her for 2 weeks, almost inseparable — but the thing is we had a lot of fights.

When I checked her phone, I found out she downloaded Bumble and Hinge before, during the time she said she fell out of love with me. When I saw it, my heart sank and I was lost for words. I confronted her calmly and asked why she did that. She said it was a one-time thing and she didn’t talk to anyone. I believed her because the last thing she needed was a fight with me while she was grieving.

Some days later, I still couldn’t shake off the feeling, so I checked her phone again. I found out she reinstalled it again after some months, and I also saw screenshots of guys talking to her. I didn’t say anything. My tears just fell, and she saw me. I didn’t blame her. I just told her I was going home and she wouldn’t see me anymore. She cried and begged for forgiveness. I forgave her again because I didn’t want to lose her.

Don’t get me wrong, she also checked my phone.

After that, things were okay. I forgave her but I couldn’t forget. Sometimes she’d catch me just staring, lost in thought.

After some days, I was using her phone to scroll on TikTok. That’s when I saw she unblocked her ex on Facebook and Instagram, and one of the guys she talked to on Hinge — they started talking on Snapchat. We were supposed to grab coffee with her family, but because I confronted her about that, we spent an hour crying and talking. She knows one of my biggest insecurities is her ex because she messaged him twice before without me knowing. But because I loved her so much, I still forgave her. I even asked her mom for forgiveness for not going, and she lashed out at me. I just cried and apologized without saying anything, because I wanted to protect my girlfriend.

Fast forward to September. We had a talk because she was very excited for her brother to move in with her. I asked why she didn’t feel that way when I was trying to move in with her. I asked her why she thought we were still together — was it because we’d been together so long, or out of comfort?

Then she told me that sometimes she asked herself that too. She said she wanted a man with authority, a bigger man. She said she didn’t see my efforts anymore.

I’m not gonna lie, this was when my emotions got the best of me. I told her she needed to let me go, that I was preventing her from reaching her full potential. I pushed her away, but she insisted she didn’t want to break up. I pushed harder. We said things we didn’t mean. We hurt each other. In the end she agreed to let me go.

A few hours later, I called her again. Told her it was just my emotions and asked her to get back together. But she didn’t want to anymore.

For the first time in my life, I lost the love of my life. It was the hardest feeling.

Even so, we still kept in touch as she promised to wait for me there. I did everything I could to make it possible. I quit drinking, focused on my traineeship to be a developer, gym 5 days a week, side hustles to save more. She was happy with my progress. We were chatting again, video calling every day, but she became distant and cold. At first I was okay with it — I understood she was protecting herself — but there were days when we talked about what happened, and even though it was hard, we knew it was necessary.

There was one time when she told me that if she exposed herself, she might find someone she found attractive — unlikely, but still possible. She asked me the same question and I told her I didn’t see myself doing that. I was focused on my goal to be with her.

After some weeks, she was still cold and distant. I told her how I felt. I was being vulnerable, thinking she’d understand. I told her I didn’t like our setup and it wasn’t healthy for me. Even though I was the one who initiated the breakup, I regretted it and have been trying to get her back. I told her I didn’t deserve everything that happened. I told her I’d give her time to heal so she could figure things out.

But she said she would now let me go. She thanked me for everything and said I’m free. I told her I didn’t accept it. I told her I would still wait for her.

Two days later, she deleted all our pictures on Instagram — like I just vanished from her life. I asked her why she did that, asked if she was really sure about her decision and what about her promise. She told me it was selfish of me to say I didn’t deserve what happened, and she wished she never agreed to stay in touch with me after the breakup because I was playing with her feelings.

And the worst part — she said, “Just because we’ve been together for 5 years doesn’t mean you’re gonna settle down with me. You shouldn’t settle for less.”

It broke me.

I know it was wrong, but I blocked her on everything. Then a few hours later, I unblocked her and messaged her saying I wasn’t settling for less, that she was the best thing that ever happened to me, and it wasn’t just 5 years — it was the most amazing 5 years of my life.

But she told me to stop messaging her and blocked me.

For the first time in my life, I finally lost her.

I had severe panic attacks for the next days. I lost my only dream in life — to be with her. To be her partner.

After I calmed down, I emailed her telling her this might be the last time she hears from me. I called her crying, telling her everything. She was supposed to come home next year, and it broke me because I was going to propose. I already had everything planned. I was crying the whole time. I told her I still love her, but if my absence would bring her peace and healing, then I’ll finally let her go. I told her this would be the last time I’d message her.

And after everything, the only thing she said was she’s not coming back.

That’s how I lost the only woman I ever loved. My greatest first love.",1,1763945277.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

Now my sister or parents stole $2k+ worth of my stuff. Help?,"Hello Reddit, this is my first time ever making a post, but I got this idea from being a long time listener of *2 Hot Takes* but I finally got the courage to come on here and ask for some help.

I’m a 22-year-old female and I moved out of my parents’ house at 19 due to mental abuse and their extremely controlling behavior. I moved to my grandma’s house for a few months, and then I was finally able to get a car. Within a few months, I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend.

After living together for a bit, I ended up moving back to my grandma’s for just a month because I started to suffer extreme panic attacks that felt like heart attacks. I took all of my belongings with me—my bed, jewelry, clothes, etc. Eventually, I moved back into my apartment. All of that happened in 2024.

This year, 2025, I moved to a cheaper, nicer apartment in a new area. During this time, I left some things at my grandma’s: my bed, some clothes, a necklace, some cups, my coffee maker, and all my coffee stuff like a stand with cups and sugar jars. A little while after this, my older sister (24) moved into the same bedroom. My grandma said it was okay, and I kept my things upstairs in a bedroom.

Recently, about four months ago, my parents messaged me saying she was selling the house and that all of my stuff had been moved to a different room because they were cleaning out the house. I was working extra long hours at the time and was unable to even go get my things

Fast forward to November 4th, 2025 I went to get my belongings, and everything was gone. My bed cost over $2,000, my necklace was a gift from my boyfriend, and everything else was either thrown away or stolen by my sister. When I was looking for my bed, I didn’t find it, but I found her old dirty bed instead, which makes me believe she took mine.

After I found out, I freaked out and texted both of my parents in a group chat asking where my stuff was. This led to my mother blowing up on me, saying she didn’t know, and my father threatening me on a phone call, saying, “You better keep your doors locked.”

Basically, I’m asking: what can I really do to get my things back or get money for them? I sent them a text because I didn’t want to take it to civil court—I just wanted the money back for my coffee pot if I am being completely honest and I even told them that. I know it may sound silly, but I’m tired of giving in and letting them run all over me, and I want something done about this.

We did lots of activities during the day but his stress means physical intimacy is hard for him so only cuddles nothing else. After the flight home, we arrived back to his house at 1am and went to bed. When he woke up, he suddenly turned dark and as he stared off into the distance I asked what was bothering him and he said nothing was wrong and he went to make coffee (and usually brings me a cup back in bed). He came back into the room and said I should go. I was shocked but could see he was upset so I packed up and he was staring out the window on the couch. I hugged him and said I hoped he felt better and to call me later and he said he won't and walked off. This cold behaviour was so out of character for him. I asked him why he wouldn't call me and he said his life is like the cold dark apartment we came home to the evening before. He says his life will never get better and he started blaming me for his living situation among other things (says I convinced him to move from his old place to be closer to me). He walked me to my car and put my luggage in, gave me a hug and says to 'have a good day'. He sends me a text the next morning that says, 'Hope you had a good morning. I am just going to take the day today to figure some stuff out.' He's had dark moments before where he tries to push me away and say that I deserve better, and that he's scared to let me in and love me because he has been betrayed so many times before. I am always steady, strong and understanding. On the trip, we had a talk about how I want connection, communication and inclusion, and inclusion into his life seems to be the hardest part for him. I know there was a birthday dinner for his Mom tonight, but I never got the invite. And I know his Mom will be asking where I am. I love this man but don't know what is going on in his head.

A lot of the dorms here are apartment style, so we each have our own bedroom, share a bathroom with only one other person, have a kitchen, all that jazz. 

For context, I bought a trashcan for the kitchen for us to share, but I don’t use that one anymore since my roommates fill it up rather quickly and I don’t want to take out someone else’s trash. I also have a light trap that catches flies. Well, recently, I noticed that the light trap has been filling up with flies rather quickly.

I was going to figure out where the source has been coming from, but as I went to throw out the old fly trap cartridge, I opened the trash can to find a SWARM of flies inside. Literally flew out right at me. Turns out, they haven’t been taking out their trash as often as they should. Also, they left a cup of coffee on the table and let it mold. It’s been sitting there for weeks.

Later, my roommate came back and I confronted him about the infestation, but he dismissed me and went straight to his bedroom.

At this point I had enough, and I made a group chat and let them know that since it’s their trash, one of them needed to take out the garbage and clean out the can, as well as getting rid of the moldy coffee today or tomorrow since the flies made their way to the fridge. I didn’t think it was fair for me to clean up someone else’s mess.

Then one of the roommates hit me with “we were already planning on a clean before Thanksgiving Break” and I was about to say that this couldn’t wait any longer, but then the other roommate said they would do it.

I told my mom this story, and she kind of implied I should’ve just cleaned it up from the get go. I don’t know, I just don’t think it’s fair that I should be obligated to clean up a kitchen I don’t use and fix a fly infestation I didn’t create.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned as a mom of a special needs child, it’s this: **the right tools don’t just make life easier—they give us breathing room.** They bring peace where there used to be chaos, structure where there used to be overwhelm, and independence where there once was frustration.

And honestly? Anything that makes daily life smoother is always welcome in my home. These tools are not just helpful; they are practical solutions that empower us as parents and caregivers.

Whether you’re new to accessibility tools or you’ve been testing every gadget under the sun.  This list breaks down the 10 most helpful, family-friendly tools that can support children with Autism, ADHD, sensory processing needs, physical disabilities, developmental delays, or medical complexities. Think of it as the cheat sheet I wish someone had handed me years ago. These tools are not just options; they are practical solutions that can truly make a difference.

Grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and let’s go over the tools that may just change your entire routine for the better.

# 1.[ **Visual Schedules & Routine Boards**](https://pawsofability.com/general/top-toys-that-support-learning-and-growth-in-autistic-children/)

*Building predictability, reducing anxiety, and setting everyone up for smoother days.*

If you’ve followed me for a while, you already know how much visual schedules have changed our home. Kids with Autism, ADHD, anxiety disorders, or sensory challenges often thrive on structure—but verbal reminders alone don’t always cut it.

**Visual schedules give clarity.**  
They show your child *what’s happening next* without the stress of constant transitions.

# Why They Work:

* Reduce anxiety by showing the steps of the day
* Support executive functioning
* Encourage independence (“I can see what to do next!”)
* Decrease meltdowns around transitions.

# Options That Work:

* **Magnetic routine boards** for younger kids
* **Velcro-based PEC boards** (great for non-speaking children)
* **Digital schedules on tablets** like Choiceworks

In our home, the most significant shift happened when I stopped *saying* everything that needed to get done… and started *showing* it. Suddenly, the morning routine didn’t feel like a wrestling match with time.

# 2. Noise-Canceling Headphones

*For sensory overload, travel days, classrooms, stores, and busy life moments.*

If you’ve ever tried grocery shopping after school during the 5 p.m. rush hour with a sensory-sensitive child—girl, you know. The fluorescent lights, the carts clashing, the music, people talking… It’s a lot.

Noise-canceling headphones are like giving your child a soft, quiet bubble when the world gets too loud.

# Why Families Love Them:

* Reduce auditory overwhelm
* Lower anxiety in busy places
* Improve focus during schoolwork.
* Helpful for transitions and new environments

# Good Choices:

* Over-ear padded headphones for younger kids
* Bluetooth sensory headphones with adjustable levels
* Foldable travel-friendly pairs for outings

We keep a pair in the car, one in the house, and one in the backpack—because meltdowns don’t schedule appointments.

# 3. Communication Devices & Apps

*Supporting speech, connection, and independence.*

Families of non-verbal or minimally verbal children know how life-changing communication tools can be. AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) tools aren’t just devices—they’re bridges. They give your child a voice.

# Common Types:

* **Tablets with AAC apps** 
* **Dedicated communication devices** 
* **Picture-exchange communication books** 

# Popular Apps:

* **Proloquo2Go** 
* **TouchChat** 
* **LAMP Words for Life** 

# Why AAC Matters:

* Supports language development
* Reduces frustration and behaviors
* Gives children autonomy
* Helps them communicate wants, needs, feelings, and choices

No child is ever “too young” or “too old” to benefit from AAC. Access to communication is a right—not a milestone.

# 4. Adaptive Utensils & Mealtime Tools

*For kids with fine motor challenges, sensory needs, or feeding difficulties.*

Mealtimes can be tricky—really hard. Between sensory aversions, motor delays, or anxiety around food, many families face daily struggles during meals that others might never think twice about.

# Tools That Help:

* **Weighted utensils** 
* **Angled or curved utensils** 
* **Non-slip plates and bowls** 
* **Divided plates for picky eaters** 
* **Vibrating spoons for oral-motor sensory seekers** 

# The Big Benefits:

* Encourage independence
* Support proper grasp and control.
* Reduce spills and frustration.n
* Help kids focus on eating, not fighting the tools.

Something as simple as a divided plate changed our dinner routine—my son no longer panicked when foods touched. Minor adjustments can be game-changing.

# 5. Sensory Swings & Compression Seats

*Regulation tools for movement seekers and sensory-driven kids.*

Kids who need sensory input often crave movement—swinging, bouncing, spinning, deep pressure, or vestibular input. Sensory swings and compression seating provide a safe outlet for that energy.

[](https://amzn.to/48jVN3x)

# Popular Options:

* **Hammock-style sensory swings** 
* **Pod swings with inflatable cushions** 
* **Compression seats or wobble chairs** 
* **Portable doorway swings** 

# Why Kids Love Them:

* Provide calming, deep pressure
* Support self-regulation
* Help with focus during schoolwork.k
* Reduce meltdowns (especially before bed or after school)

Movement isn’t a distraction—it’s regulation. Once I accepted that, our home became a much calmer place.

**6. Weighted Blankets & Compression Wear**

*Calming tools for nighttime, car rides, and moments of overstimulation.*

Weighted blankets have gotten popular in recent years—and for good reason. The gentle pressure can feel grounding and soothing, helping children regulate their bodies.

# Benefits:

* Improve sleep and bedtime routines
* Reduce anxiety
* Calm sensory overload
* Support focus and stillness

Compression clothing, like snug vests or shirts, provides that same stabilizing pressure *throughout the day*.

# Great For:

* ASD
* ADHD
* Sensory Processing Disorder
* Anxiety
* Emotional regulation needs

Just make sure the blanket is the right weight (usually around 10% of the child’s body weight).

# 7. Visual Timers & Transition Tools

*The secret weapon every special needs family should have.*

If transitions are complex in your home, please know you’re not alone. Children who struggle with executive functioning or sensory processing often need extra support moving from one activity to another.

Visual timers are magical for this.

# Examples:

* **Time Timer** (the classic red disappearing pie shape)
* **Sand timers** 
* **Light-up timers** 
* **Digital countdown timers** 

# Why They Help:

* Reduce “surprise transitions”
* Give kids control and predictability.
* Break down tasks into manageable chunks.
* Decrease arguments (“It’s not me ending screen time—the timer says so!”)

We use timers for everything from brushing teeth to finishing chores to switching activities during homeschool or homework time.

# 8. Mobility Aids & Positioning Tools

*Providing stability, independence, and comfort for children with physical disabilities.*

This category looks different for every family—and everybody. Mobility aids aren’t “one size fits all,” but when you find the right one, it opens up the world for your child.

# Helpful Tools:

* **Gait trainers** 
* **Adaptive strollers** 
* **Specialized seating systems** 
* **Standing frames** 
* **Supportive cushions and posture chairs** 

# Why They Matter:

* Increase independence
* Support safe movement
* Improve posture
* Reduce fatigue
* Encourage participation at home and school.

Never feel guilty about using mobility tools—they’re not “crutches,” they’re *supports that make participation possible*.

# 9. Smart Home Devices for Accessibility

*Technology that makes daily routines smoother, safer, and more manageable.*

This is one of my favorite growing categories, especially for busy families juggling therapies, appointments, meals, school, work, and much more. Smart home tools can create safer environments, prevent overwhelm, and simplify communication.

# Helpful Smart Tools:

* **Voice-activated assistants (Alexa, Google Home)** 
* **Smart bulbs with adjustable brightness** 
* **Video doorbells for wandering prevention** 
* **Smart locks for safety** 
* **Plug-in nightlights with motion sensors** 
* **Reminders and routine prompts (“Time for your visual schedule!”)** 

# Family Wins:

* Build independence (“Alexa, turn on my light!”)
* Improve safety
* Help kids with language delays practice communication.
* Reduce caregiver overwhelm

I can’t tell you how many meltdowns we’ve prevented just by saying, “Alexa, dim the lights.”

# 10. Fidget Tools & Sensory Kits

*Because regulation doesn’t just happen—we help kids build the skills for it.*

Fidgets sometimes get a bad reputation from people who don’t understand sensory needs. But here’s the truth:

Fidgets aren’t toys. They’re *tools* that help kids regulate their emotions.

[](https://amzn.to/4o36XhR)

# Great Types:

* Marble-and-mesh fidgets
* Squish balls
* Tangles
* Chewable necklaces (oral-safe materials only!)
* Pop tubes
* Resistance bands
* Sensory bottles
* Putty or kinetic sand

# Why They Help:

* Reduce anxiety
* Support focus
* Replace harmful stimming behaviors with safe alternatives.
* Provide grounding input during transitions or stressful moments.

We keep a small sensory kit in the car, one in the living room, and one in my son’s backpack—preparedness = peace.

# Final Thoughts: Supporting Your Child Starts With Supporting Your Family

Using accessibility tools isn’t about “fixing” your child—it’s about **supporting who they already are**. Every child deserves tools that help them thrive, communicate, feel safe, and participate in the world in the way that works best for them.

And every caregiver deserves tools that make life a little easier, too.

There’s no shame in using accessibility supports. In fact, the real shame would be *not using them* simply because someone else doesn’t understand their purpose.

You’re doing a fantastic job.  
You’re learning, adapting, trying new things, and making choices that support your child’s wellbeing—and that’s something to be proud of.

We did lots of activities during the day but his stress means physical intimacy is hard for him so only cuddles nothing else. After the flight home, we arrived back to his house at 1am and went to bed. When he woke up, he suddenly turned dark and as he stared off into the distance I asked what was bothering him and he said nothing was wrong and he went to make coffee (and usually brings me a cup back in bed). He came back into the room and said I should go. I was shocked but could see he was upset so I packed up and he was staring out the window on the couch. I hugged him and said I hoped he felt better and to call me later and he said he won't and walked off. This cold behaviour was so out of character for him. I asked him why he wouldn't call me and he said his life is like the cold dark apartment we came home to the evening before. He says his life will never get better and he started blaming me for his living situation among other things (says I convinced him to move from his old place to be closer to me). He walked me to my car and put my luggage in, gave me a hug and says to 'have a good day'. He sends me a text the next morning that says, 'Hope you had a good morning. I am just going to take the day today to figure some stuff out.' He's had dark moments before where he tries to push me away and say that I deserve better, and that he's scared to let me in and love me because he has been betrayed so many times before. I am always steady, strong and understanding. On the trip, we had a talk about how I want connection, communication and inclusion, and inclusion into his life seems to be the hardest part for him. I know there was a birthday dinner for his Mom tonight, but I never got the invite. And I know his Mom will be asking where I am. I love this man but don't know what is going on in his head. I know I can't fix his depression but I can walk alongside him while he heals. I want to give him an ultimatum to either choose me or choose himself, because the alternative is confusing.

1p52p8s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p52p8s,First successful set of flights in 8 years and loved it! here's a story & help for others,"Hey all,

Hope you all are getting ready for your next flight and there is some calm in yourselves as you prepare for the adventures that await on the other-side!

I joined this community a few weeks back and i can't express the thanks to all of you for sharing and helping those in need (specially the pilots who just make it fun!)

I've just got back from 6 days in Iceland from London (3 hour flight time) Just thought i'd share some of the parts of my experience of being a nervous flyer to now someone who can't wait for the next flight!

It took me a while (and these 2 flights) to realise that i have a fear of the build up; not the flight itself! I've spent years avoiding flying, taking trips by train or ferry and not going too far (Eurostar was my happy place).

But i want to share the step i took to understand and make that final step onto a plane this week gone.

**Study**

First up, i've read the following 2 books:  
\- Flying with confidence - Captain Steve Alright, for me the second segment of the book in managing and understanding phobias was the best part for me to understand what i needed to make the choose to get on a plane.

\- Cockpit confidential - Patrick Smith, this book really was the tipping point for me. It made me release how normal flying is, how much joy it brings to those flying our planes and all of the oddities of the airports and plane noises (airports was one of my trigger thinking fears)

**Practice**

I spend an average of 6 hours a week on trains and the tube, i'd spend some of this time putting my mind into the idea of being on a plane, feeling the movements and noise of this transport method; will tell you now having been in the air, it's smoother than any tube or train i've been on!

**Use Flightradar24 or similar**

I found this very helpful; just turn it on and you'll see hundreds if not thousands of flights currently in the air!

track others in this community when they ask for it! it was great watching others successfully complete there flights (Woohoo!) and helping them too!

But most over; find your own flight path; watch the plane from the beginning to the end and see the history of how many times this has been repeated over and over all with great success!

i booked my flight 2 months in advance to allow for this too; i'd tend to have it on a second screen while i went about my day, it's surprising how quickly time goes and how easily it would be to watch Netflix at home or in the air!

**Go to the airport!**

This was a week or so before i was due to fly; but it's totally worth going to an airport and just wonder around, have a coffee and watch the coming and goings of the airport and to see the planes take off and land; take your time with this; it's good to see how natural it all is and just how often the planes come and go; the dedication of all the staff and the flow of the undertaking of what the planes go though between flights.

I'd specially like to note look out for the pilots, they generally look cheerful and dotting around like they have had there best day at work (and now i can see why what a amazing job!) But they generally act like its another day at the office, not to take away from all the time and dedication they spend on there duties -> read Cockpit confidential for more on this!

**Prescription medication / Alternatives / Liquor**

I've seen fair about of chatter on this channel regarding prescription medication and the pros and cons of them, seems like many they don't seems to have the right effect, but each of us suffer in our own way; so do what is right for you :)

In my case; i was always told to go the doctor and get some to help with my fear; but aways opted to not do this. For me the way was to use some over the counter herbal oils; I wanted to be fully aware of what i was doing (eg getting on a plane!) so i could unlearn my fear and turn it into something positive so using this i was relaxed but not dopy; but as said before each of us have our own way to manage stress/fear; i would recommend this if it suits you.

I did have a few drinks also before the flight, we luckily had access to the lounge at Heathrow; so i had around 3 gin and tonics; it was just enough for me to again be happy and giggly before the flight, but still very aware of my situation and environment.

I would not recommend getting hammered/drunk before your flight, as above its better to understand & absorb your experience of flight  and more over it's likely going to cause more issue when you are in the air, specially for the onboard cabin crew...!

**Getting on the plane!**

This was the hardest part for me; as i'm sure for many others. As we left the lounge to board the plane; this is where my nerves really kicked in; specially when walking down the tunnel to the plane; my partner was doing a great job of making me laugh and keeping me a-little distracted as we boarded.

The first step on the plane is just joy and fear ( luckily i didn't need a push! ) i'd recommend smiling and greeting the onboard team, straight away they could see i was nervous; they have seen hundreds of us the fearful; and they will keep an eye on you in if are nice to them :) - chat to them also if you have a chance, let them know; our flight attendant was so kind and could see my hand shaking as we boarded she came to check on me, then chatted away and after an update from the pilot later in the flight came to explain what it was and just to reassure me (by then i was  having a great time! but more on that later)

**Takeoff**

I'm sure for many this is the worst part; it was going to be for me; it was where all of the fear and dread on the build up for me was. I knew prior to the flight once take off has happened there is sod all i can do so have to accept it (practiced this in the train also).

My nervous was at full point, my partner did at one point think i was going to get off the plan e with all my reorganising my things and moving in my seat around! Just remember at this point it it's great to breath, you are perfectly safe; the noises are totally normal for this machine which is 100 years in the making with 100,000+ people operating/managing/checking daily and globally! read more on this within both of the books i've recommended and within this community :)

for me i was making sure i was fully embracing the fear, i also documented it with my phone for future moments ( i did this with my flight 8 years ago, watching those videos back the flight was great for me; i can see i was totally okay; happy after a short bit and really happy once we where in the air, it's easy to forget; specially when like me leaving it 8 years between flights)

The run up to take off was for me a strange turn, the moment the aircraft got to speed and lifted into the air i was happy and really enjoying it; i think this was due to me knowing i'd overcome the fear and the adventures awaiting on the other side, and wow Iceland was for sure!  ***Just remember it's in yourselves to break free and have adventures you'd have missed by getting past this!***

\* read about the takeoff angles, it really helped me and also a recommendation from someone here, lean forwards when take off happens; it helps a-lot!

**During the flight**

The flight was truly amazing, the views out of the window (see photos) was just something else! It is easy for the mind to wonder when you are on the plane, so make sure to have distractions; many have shared on here taking games to help with this; I'd recommend this also although i didn't really need to do this for myself. Just remember the destination is going to be amazing (hopefully!) and everything on the plane is designed to be in the air! some things i learned before getting on the plane ->

\- the wings will bend and have been tested to large degrees (some 90 degrees!) even tho they don't need to when in flight, a pilot will correct me, but i think its something like 5 degrees in flight if any at all!  
\- commercial planes have 2 engines, can fly with 1 and fly with none if needed for a short period to get you down safely.  
\- We've been flying for over 100 years, 50+ commercially; the best minds go into designing these machines, they go though testing you'd never even consider; they get serviced constantly and i'm still finding out facts daily on how much effort and consideration goes into commercial flight  it's now just fascinating (please read Cockpit confidential, it's a great starting point).

**Landing**

Landing was also a great experience; it was amazing to see the glaciers over Iceland as we approached, the black sand beaches! it might for some seem unusual as the plane turns and approaches at a slight downwards pace; but again it's all normal, for me i sort of pictured it as a bounce on a marshmallow as the plane glides on the air pockets and softly approaches. Things to remember when this is happening ->  
\- Both pilots have control, one drives and the other monitors and this is with a combination of instruments that have been fully tested and have redundant backups to assist.  
\- There is a team on the ground guiding them in; it's a beautiful and choreographed sequenced between the pilots and the ground crew, they practice this daily both in and out of the plane itself.

\- ***you are about to get to perhaps some of the best moments in your life!***

**Afterwards**

So i've spoke pretty positively throughout this as it is an experience i now want to keep having! But there was something odd that did happen after the first flight, for all the love and joy i had; on the 3rd night of the holiday thinking about flying gave me the same internal nervousness i'd been having before the flight; **the fear of the fear itself.** This is why i'd highly recommend the study and practice; followed by documenting the experience (sorry for the long read, this is part of it for me too!)

I used the references, the books and photos and videos i took to centre myself again, knowing i've done it and loved the moments i was there! i'd somehow managed to block any prior memories of flight from the previous 8 years before and long gaps before this; i will have these photos on my wall now, check on them consistently; just like quitting smoking it only takes 1 smoke to become a smoker again; so the same goes for fears; if i let it become one again.

\-----------

I'm about to book my next flight! i can't wait to feel the rise of the plane, to see the sky and the adventures on the other side! The nerves will return i'm sure; but i know the joy will be there once i'm up!  Shall i do it solo this time? :)

Thanks for reading everyone, i thank you all for the support i received from this community so hope this can help others and i will continue to help and share where i can :)

1p52ne9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1p52ne9/am_i_weak_or_is_this_normal/,Am I weak or is this normal,"I’ve been staying at home with my 17 month old and I live with my in-laws. My MIL is incredible and when she’s not working (she works a few days a week), she’s happy to watch baby for a bit while I shower or walk the dog. And my husband comes home at 5:30 and does the entire bath and bedtime routine while I clean up. My mom, who was a SAHM, says I’m extremely lucky - and I am. 

But it also makes me feel like a horrible mom for being so damn overstimulated all the time. My daughter is majorly attached to me and constantly needs me to pick her up (only to then wriggle out almost immediately). If I move to the other side of the kitchen to make a cup of coffee, she starts yelling. She is often yelling “mama mama mama mama” non stop and crawling up my leg. At the same time, my dog (whom I still love dearly) has gotten very overprotective and barks constantly at everyone walking past the door, and somehow always needs a walk right when the baby is having a meltdown. 

I am fried. I am so so fried. I just want to scream, shut up shut up shut up. I don’t, of course. I try and breathe and smile and redirect. It looks like I’m calm on the outside but on the inside, after a certain number of hours, every whine and cry and bark triggers me to the extreme. 

I know some SAHMs have it harder - so please spare me any harsh judgment, I get enough of that from my own mom. But is this a normal reaction to everyone very loudly needing me? Or am I some flavor of neurodivergent/depressed and need an intervention?",3,1763943931.0,sahm,5,1.0,False

[ me(26M) her(27F) currently, and we both are Asian just for the refrence]

So she and i grew up together from like 9 or 10 years old and we are in same class and everyone always teased me and always ship us together. Back then i was a super shy guy, low self esteem because of fat and short and always think i'm not enough for her because she is super gorgeous and super cute. 

She always calls me this cute nickname that only she used and she always tells me that i'm cute. I always refuse to show that i have a crush on her because i was super shy and always thought I never have a chance with her. Around 15, i have to moved US and we got distanced a bit but I go back to my hometown after like 3 years and she's will always called me and says things like let's go there, let's do this and etc. Even that time friends always teased me with her and I always just tried to brush it off and deny. 

There was this water festival that is coming up around April and she called me to ask if I want to go along with them [ her family and our friends but only one friend were with us] and I happily accepted it. I went to her home for the first time met her family and told that i will take care of her and dont worry [ just trying to be nice as a gentleman]. Took her to my home and my whole family got amazed because she was the first girl i brought to home and I tend to stay alone by myself but just cover it up by telling my family she is just a friend. Almost spends the whole festival with her and still nothing happened yet between her. But i was never been that happy before in my life and there comes the time to leave to stateside again, met her in the coffee shop one last time before i go back. Told her that i'm super thankful and appreciated a lot for everything. 

Came back to the state, always felt sad and looking back all those pics and videos that i took and realize i cannot lie to myself more and every days my love for her grows and i know myself i'm really falling for her. So i told a couple of our mutual friends and they totally support me said i should confess. So i confess her and she said that it would never happen between us.

Totally crushed and heart broken for the first time in my life because the love for her is not anything that i experience before and i've never been in love with anyone before. Even after she rejected me, friends are still teasing us in gatherings and meetups and i thought I should left this friend group because i don't want to bother her and she could be hurt because of me, and thought I'm putting her in awkward position. So I started to distancing with the friends too and stopped showing up to gatherings and stopped answering to videos calls. 

So as a young guy, heartbroken, and angry to the world, i volunteer for one of the physically hardest work position during heart break process and just trying to keep my mind focus on work. But still, I couldn't move on easily and i always check her on social media like what is she up to until  2020 but i never talked to her or text her since the reject. 
[ i still have her pics in the phone and pc, but always tried not to look them yet still watch those every now and then, and always look to the necklace pendent made with real snowflake inside that I kept to give her but never got the chance ]

About 2 days ago, stumbled into this song called called 九万字 [about a tragic love story that never happens], and kept thinking about her and i think i'm still in love with her after all these years. I haven't talk to her since 2019 and I really miss her a lot, and I don't know what to do. I had a crush on her since like 10-11 years old and now i'm 26, yet I still haven't moved on from her and i cannot tell anyone including my friends because they might told her and it might bother her more or makes her uneasy. 

I really don't know what to do. Can anyone tells me how to moved on from experience like this or how to deal with. Thank you for reading",1,1763943922.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

>Among the many tales of tragedy and heroism on the Great Lakes, none are more famous than the wreck of the taconite ore hauler SS Edmund Fitzgerald on November 10th, 1975. 

>

>Rightfully so, as she was the most well-known ship on the lakes, if a ship can be a celebrity, she surely was, and her loss is still felt in the region today. 

>

>Being familiar with the region myself, I was well aware of her sinking and the facts that surrounded it. Among them, repeated in media from documentaries to newspapers to internet videos, is the assertion, given as fact, that she was the last big ship to ever sink on the Lakes. 

>

>Lakes which had lost ships at an alarming rate for their entire history to that point. This, it is said, was because of the changes made to the industry after her sinking. 

>

>So imagine my surprise when, while researching for a book I was planning to write on the Lakes and their many ghost stories, I found that she was not in fact the last large ship to sink beneath their waters. 

>

>It started in May of 2020 when I stumbled across an old newspaper obituary that read “Otto Fredrik Carlsen, age 49, of Gary, Indiana, passed away tragically on January 3, 1977, in the line of duty as First Mate aboard the SS Jonathan Winewater, which was lost during a severe winter storm on Lake Superior.”

>

>These words set me on a quest to learn everything I could about the Jonathan Winewater, as it seemed to me that it had been forgotten to history, and soon I abandoned my plans to write about ghost stories at all. 

>Learning anything other than that the ship had existed was surprisingly hard, but eventually I was able to put together this much information. The SS Jonathan Winewater was launched in 1960, owned by the now-defunct Maryland-based company Winewater International and named for its founder.

>

>The Winewater was in all respects a typical ship of the period, without anything of note to set it apart, anything that is except the fact that its sinking seems to have been almost deliberately ignored. 

>

>Excepting a handful of obituaries for the crew and a single line in an Erie, Pennsylvania, Newspaper, the Lakeshore Star, there was no coverage whatsoever of the tragedy. Similarly strange was that the owners, a successful and seemingly stable company, would declare bankruptcy soon after, citing the loss of a major investor in connection with the wreck.

>

>The coast guard had been only slightly less quiet after the accident, saying only that the ship had been found beached in two pieces on the Canadian coast and was being scrapped by the owners. 

>

>When trying to find pictures of this wreck washed ashore in Canada, I found none. Why was this? I was hooked and smelled a cover-up here, so I began to dig deeper. 

>

>However, after years of researching and interviewing people connected to the tragedy, I barely knew more than I had at the start.

>

>Oh, I understood the crew better and knew more particulars about the design of the ship. I even eventually found a single picture of the wreck, in, of all things, a tiny German-language newspaper from North Dakota, “Der Prairie Zeitung,” a small and grainy black and white shot taken from a cheap camera. 

>

>But I knew nothing more about why the ship had sunk, what had become of the remainder of the wreck, or anything concrete with which to write a book; at most, I had a chapter. Disheartened, I gave up and moved on to new things, that is, until a chance encounter with an old acquaintance whose son was serving in the Coast Guard, where he was heading a project to modernize their archive system and transfer much of it to digital storage gave me an in. 

>

>After a few more months of meetings and explaining the idea behind my book to various important people, I was finally given access to the archives, where I found… nothing. 

>

>At least at first. After two weeks of searching and just when I was about to give up for a second time, I found a file at the bottom of a box I had overlooked. It was thinner than most and slightly water-damaged from improper storage, but the words on the tape still clearly read “Winewater”

>My heart jumped for joy when I saw that, but dropped again when I saw how little was in the folder. Two sheets of paper and a small notebook were all it contained.

>

>The papers were both identical copies of an unusually poor quality report on the wreck, far shorter and less detailed than was usual for Coast Guard reports, that told me nothing I had not already known. 

>

>The small book, however, a pocket notebook, was more than I could ever have bargained for. Allegedly written by the ship’s cook, what follows is one of the most inexplicable accounts I have ever read. I post it here in the hope that someone will be able to make more sense of it than I have, or perhaps just to prove to me that it is fake, a hoax, or a lie. 

>

>When the SS Jonathan Winewater left port on December 31, 1976, it had 16 people aboard, comprising 15 crew members and 1 passenger. Sixteen people, but if these final words of Ship’s Cook, Thomas Faegan, are to be believed, only fifteen souls. \]

**The Wreck of the Jonathan Winewater:**

I know I am to die, so I write this accounting of our fate that the world might know there are things its philosophy has never dreamed of. Things older and darker than man wishes to imagine 

I am, I suppose, the captain of the bulk carrier SS Jonathan Winewater, but only by the virtue of my own Irish Luck. The rest of the crew are dead, leaving me alone, the ship’s cook, and all but retired to hold her helm. And hold it I shall, until my watch ends wherever I may find a shore, even if they are the shores of hell. 

Sitting on the table next to me is a length of rope. When I have finished penning this account, I intend to tie my hands to the wheel and steer her true for as long as my strength holds. Not long, I fear, the pain of my broken leg is gone now, and the cold is already sapping my strength.

I hear her calling me. The witch of the lakes, her banshee howl in the screaming of the wind through wires, tells me I am damned. I would welcome her. What better fate for a sailor than to perish with his ship? 

I am old, and leave no one behind to mourn; if it weren’t for the thing I believe to be aboard, I would accept my fate with a smile. But I fear for what will happen if it gets ashore. Still, I was the cook on her maiden voyage seventeen years ago, and if there is a chance I can still save her, I must try! 

If any should find this and read it, then I pray you will see it as more than the insane ramblings of a broken man, and take its warning. God save you all. 

We left the port of Erie on New Year's Eve 1976, bound for Thunder Bay, with fifteen souls aboard, a skeleton crew to her regular complement of twenty-nine, myself a last-minute addition to the roster.

I had been retired five years when I received the call from Captain Leclerc, my old shipmate, asking me to cover for Teddy, the young man I had trained to replace me, what seems now a lifetime ago when I finally left the lakes. The Winewater had to make one final unscheduled run this season on short notice. But Teddy was getting married that weekend, and so could not sail. 

Leclerc, knowing I loved the ship I had left behind, and that I was not in the best of situations financially since my divorce, gave me a call and asked if I wanted to take one last cruise with him on my old ship. My answer, of course, was “yes”.

The pay was unheard of, double pay and a potential bonus beyond that. But I would’ve sailed for free, if asked, retirement did not suit me.

I confess I am one of the last of that old breed of sailors whose wife is the water, and whose child is the deck beneath his feet. It made me a terrible romantic and a worse husband. Worst of all, it made me happy. 

When I arrived aboard her, I asked Leclerc what we were hauling this late in the season, and his answer confused me more than not knowing had. 

Our hold was to be empty except for a small load of ballast to keep her stable. And instead, we were to haul a cargo of forty-five wooden boxes, and not ask questions. 

He seemed as confused as I, and anxious to be making such a run this time of year,  this route was never safe this late in the season. But the request had come from the owners themselves, a favor to a Shareholder, he said. 

An aging and wealthy European, the Countess DuCharme, who would be coming aboard before we sailed. In more than fifty years with the company, I had never heard of such a request. Still, our pay made it worth it to all aboard, and I felt the call of the lakes. 

Around midnight the night before we were to sail, I made my way to the galley to check our supplies and add some of the special ingredients I had bought to the refrigerator. Planning to pull out all the stops and treat the crew to something special this run; it only seemed right. 

Because I had come in so early, I was there when the cargo arrived, two large trucks marked with the Winewater International logo. 

I watched with casual interest as the Longshoremen loaded crate after crate aboard on pallets, several at a time, and wondered idly how they intended to secure them, as we were not designed for that type of cargo, being an ore hauler. I would later learn they were stowed in out-of-the-way corners of the engineering deck.

I was struck by the speed and efficiency with which they loaded them. I had never seen longshoremen work so fast. It's an old joke that they would get in trouble with their union if they did a job without taking at least three breaks. Today, however, they moved as if they wanted the job done as soon as possible, something that I found to be strangely unsettling. 

What stood out to me about the boxes, however, was what they looked like. Simple wooden crates about seven feet long by two feet wide, they resembled nothing as closely as they did coffins. 

Perhaps they were, the thought made me shudder, but it would have explained the Longshoremen’s attitudes. So I resolved to be there when the Captain welcomed the consignor aboard, so that I could get a look at her. 

When she arrived, we were all surprised. We had been told to expect an elderly woman, but the girl who boarded just before sunrise couldn't have been more than 20. 

She wore a long, conservatively cut dress made of some expensive black fabric I can’t name. On anyone else, it would've seemed like a costume; it was so old-fashioned. But she carried herself with such confidence that it barely registered as unusual.

She walked with surprising speed, given the dress, up the gangplank, but stopped still before stepping through the hatch, her eyes darting to the Captain as she asked, “Permission to come aboard?” in a soft, faintly accented voice.

Taking the Captain’s arm as she stepped over the bulkhead, she told us she was the “Countess DuCharme’s granddaughter” and that her “Dear grandmother” had taken suddenly ill and could not join us. She showed the captain papers that said as much and that she was empowered to act as the Countess’ agent, and the captain nodded sympathetically. 

Things were so strange as they were that we didn’t question this as much as perhaps we should have. In truth, the others were all upset at the overtime and wanted only to be done and home with the money from this run in their pockets. So they shrugged and welcomed her aboard. I alone voiced questions, and these later, while alone with the captain. 

As she passed me in the hall, I caught a faint hint of what I took to be an unusual perfume, floral and slightly metallic. It was unpleasant, but I don’t, as a rule, question taste. Her dress was unusual, too. 

Outside in the harsh dockside lighting, I had taken it to be all black, but as she passed close to me, I saw that it had a strange swirling pattern all over it in a very thin red thread, so dark it could only be told apart from the black when the light caught it as she moved. 

The effect was mesmerizing, and I realized I was staring, which embarrassed me, of course, since I did not want her to think I was leering. Still, I found it hard to look away as she passed. 

As soon as she was aboard and had handed her bags to The Kid, as we collectively called any of the cadets from the maritime academy who did their internship on the Winewater. She turned to the captain and asked to see the cargo. Having work of my own to do to get ready for breakfast, I left then and returned to the galley.

Around twenty minutes later, Leclerc ducked into my galley and told me not to worry about cooking for our guest. I asked why, and made a joke about how I hoped she hadn’t gone overboard.

We shared a small laugh before he explained that she had been exhausted after several days of near sleepless travel and had elected to just go to bed. 

I shrugged, one less mouth wouldn’t change the calculus of the kitchen all that much, but before Leclerc could leave, I told him to stay a minute while I asked him some questions. 

First and most important was; if those boxes had truly been what they looked like. Because without a doubt, they looked like one thing and one thing only. 

He shook his head and said no. While down with DuCharme to inspect them, he had glanced at the customs paperwork stapled to them, which included a manifest saying they were boxes of dirt being shipped to a university laboratory in Alaska, and that they had come from East Germany. 

This was strange enough, but Leclerc assured me that all the papers had been in order, and reminded me we were instructed not to ask questions. He said that the owners had vouched for her and made it clear we were not doing anything illegal, but that the secrecy was necessary. 

Unsure of this myself, I remarked that “We have dirt in the states,” but the Captain just told me not to worry about it. It is an old man’s job to worry, and I told him as much, but pushed things no farther. If only I had, if only!

None of the crew saw our guest for the rest of the day until after dinner, when the Captain, myself, and a few of the other old hands were sitting in the mess hall having coffee and playing cards. She came in so quietly that it took her clearing her throat for us to notice her. 

The Captain was apologetic over her having missed two meals, and I offered to make her something, but she refused, saying she was on a special diet and had pre-packaged meals in her room. Eventually, the Captain did convince her to have a cup of coffee with us at least. 

I thought he was being a bit pushy, but I sensed he wanted to get a read on her, given how generally strange this was. She made polite small talk but told little. I noticed she did not appear to enjoy her coffee, only taking a few small sips and then setting it aside. 

The weather the next day was calm as we made our way through Detroit and into Lake Huron, but by the evening, as we were passing by Manitoulin Island, the National Weather Service was warning of a storm brewing ahead of us.

With any other Captain, I would have feared to sail against a storm this late in the season, but Leclerc was to these lakes what Nelson was to Trafalgar.  While some of the less experienced crew were clearly nervous, I never feared. Younger than me by about twenty years, I had been cook on the Allan W. Chambers when he was just a rookie, and had taken him under my wing for a time. We had lost touch for a few years after that, until he became captain of the Winewater in the late sixties, where we renewed our friendship.

He was one of the very few truly good captains I ever knew, and could brave any storm. To whoever is reading this, he would have braved this one, too. If it were not for that thing. Let the record show, when this is investigated, that if he could not save our ship, no man alive or dead could have. And on that I stake my reputation!

For Breakfast that morning, I made the crew steak and eggs with a side of hash browns, and for our engineer, a short, broad man from Alabama known simply as Bubba, a pot of grits.

We all ate and talked with obviously high morale, despite the grumbling about more time away from home from most of the men. A few of the younger men pestered me for stories from the old days, which I was happy to tell.

Then someone suggested The Kid grab his guitar and sing us a song. We all had work to do, but the captain seemed in no hurry and told him to go ahead. He played an old love song and sang with a clear, sweet voice. 

That was just two days ago, but now I cannot even remember the song, so much sorrow has come since.

By lunch, we were steaming north through Huron, hugging the Canadian side of the line with the coast of the Bruce Peninsula visible through a light fog to starboard. 

The Countess’s Granddaughter stayed in her room most of the day; however, around seven PM, as we were beginning our approach to the Soo Locks at Sault Sainte Marie. I stepped out on deck to smoke and saw her standing up by the bow, head tilted slightly down, as if in prayer. Despite the apparent innocence of this act, something about it struck me with a feeling of dread I could not explain. But this only lasted a moment, as she turned and began walking back in my direction, and the effect was gone. It’s only now that I think back, I realize that she had no shadow. 

I had terrible nightmares that night, of distant eyes red as the fires of hell watching me wherever I went, and woke up covered in a cold sweat several times. 

We traversed the Soo Locks around noon on the second, passing into Lake Superior for the final leg of our journey. By then, the weather had already begun to turn, and I could feel an unease in the air. 

Walking to my cabin that afternoon to retrieve a book I had been reading, I passed DuCharme speaking with The Kid in the hall. While not against the rules, Cadets speaking with VIPs had been known to put their feet in their mouths before, causing problems for the entire crew and their young careers. 

So, taking it upon myself, as the ship’s grandfather that I was, I interjected myself to make sure everything was alright. DuCharme gave a small laugh, instantly seeming to read what I was doing, and said she had been asking The Kid about his family, just passing the time. Not unusual, as they were similar in age. 

That said, something seemed wrong to me, so I took The Kid aside, telling her I needed his help and questioned him. He had a weird look about him, slightly glassy-eyed and vacant, which I thought may just have been the result of the ship’s rolling motion. Which can affect men with a weak inner ear, almost like alcohol, after enough time. 

Still, I didn’t truly believe that to be the case; I could not explain why. He shook himself, seeming to throw off some fog, and blinked at me before he seemed to get his mental feet under him. But corroborated her story that they had just been having a casual conversation. 

I wanted to push farther, but didn’t really have a reason to do so, so I dropped it. Of course, now I wish I hadn’t. 

The weather continued to get worse, the wind picking up to a constant whine and a bitter cold slowly creeping in, until by sunset we were sailing through a storm. The ship rolled on the waves as we steamed towards our destination, which by the charts was about another day from where we were. 

At dinner, Carlsen, the mate, told me in confidence that Leclerc was considering putting in somewhere to wait out the storm despite the risk that would pose to the bonuses we had been promised for a speedy delivery. 

That night, the first tragedy of our voyage would strike, but nobody would realize until the next morning. 

I was in the galley discussing the day’s menu with the captain when Bubba stuck his head in through the hatch, looking worried. He asked if he could have a minute of the captain’s time, and Leclerc nodded, asking him, “What's up?”

The Kid wasn’t in his bunk when Bubba, his roommate aboard, woke up, already unusual as Bubba was the early riser of the pair. It instantly became more worrying when Bubba told us his boots were still next to his bed, where he’d taken them off the night before. 

Leclerc quickly organized a search of the ship, but we found no trace of him, and soon it became obvious that he was not aboard. Neither was DuCharme, which, while worse, did not upset the crew nearly as much. 

As soon as the search was finished, Leclerc ordered everyone not doing crucial work to gather in the mess hall to report on whether they had found anything. 

Bubba said he had returned to the Cabin he shared with The Kid to look for any clues as to where he might have gone and, looking closer than he had before at The Kid’s bed, found two small bloodstains on his pillow. Not enough to mean anything serious. 

Just two drops, which he said he would not have mentioned except for The Kid being missing. 

Questioning the crew, nobody had seen anything.

Red, a large Irish deckhand, stumbled in, then, looking pale, when asked what was wrong, he swallowed and seemed for a moment unable to speak. Then gathering himself with some effort, he admitted he had seen two figures walking slowly along the deck the night before, writing it off since he only glimpsed them for a moment during the storm. He described how, for a moment, he had seen them like shadows, then the storm had seemed to almost bend around them, and they were gone. 

At this, a tragic picture entered my mind unbidden, and I remembered how the kid had been talking with DuCharme, and at once the possibility became clear to me. 

If the two young people had taken to each other and decided to meet in secret on the deck, any number of fates could have befallen them. I knew the kid had been reprimanded for not wearing his safety line before, and if he were with a woman? It all seemed a disturbingly real possibility to me. 

Going on, he stated that part of the reason he hadn’t told anyone was that when he glimpsed the other figure. Their eyes had been glowing a deep red, like distant taillights on the interstate. 

Leclerc grew angry, a rare sight, and berated him for not reporting this. We were all upset, we’d liked The Kid, a miracle in and of itself for a cadet aboard a laker. And to lose a passenger overboard might be enough to ruin the careers of all aboard. 

But we didn’t have time for recriminations, and Leclerc knew it, even as this meeting we going on, we could all feel the storm growing worse. 

Some of the men accused Red of having been drunk, which he denied, and for my part, I believe him. A Storm can do funny things to the eyes; the swirling patterns of rain or snow blowing about make unusual shapes sometimes. Such a momentary hallucination, while strange, was not out of the realm of believability. 

Based on when Red claimed to have seen the two figures, we knew that if true, they must’ve gone overboard hours before. Still, we had to try and help somehow.

Leclerc ruled to our dismay that we were unable to safely turn around with the waves knocking us about as much as they were. And no happier than the rest of us, he resigned himself to call a report into the Coastguard’s Group Soo back at the Locks, and pray. 

As the long day dragged on, the accident casting a cloud of gloom over the men, the storm grew worse and worse until twenty-foot waves were pounding the Winewater, tossing us around like a rubber duck in a child’s bath. 

A few years ago, when the Fitzgerald sank, the papers reported the storm had been of a sort only seen every thirty years; this may be true. But the storm that day must’ve been almost as bad, for the waves were rising like buildings, or the walls of a canyon, before pounding down on the deck. 

Tragic as the losses were, every man aboard knew that we had to work hard to save ourselves, or we could easily join them. 

When the big waves hit in the really bad storms, you’d think man had sinned so bad that The Almighty was going back on his word to Noah and trying to drown us anew. More water than you’ve ever seen will rise like a monster from the deep and pound down, covering the deck of your ship. 

Then just when you think it’s all over and she’s sure to sink. She’ll pull up again and shake off the water like an old dog. It’s a terrible and beautiful thing to see. 

This was such a storm, I saw men I knew to have no patience for religion pray as the ship shuddered beneath their feet. We rode the wild rollercoaster ride for what felt like days, though it cannot have been more than an hour, before something shifted and we felt things growing calmer, almost imperceptibly, around us. 

There were no cheers or shouts at this, only a calm thankfulness masked by bravado. That itself was short-lived. I made a pot of coffee for was the bridge crew once the worst of the storm seemed done and climbed to the pilot house to give it to them myself. 

As I made my way through the belly of the ship, an eerie silence seemed to have fallen on it, the sorrow of the men at our losses, almost a physical presence in the air. 

It was in that silence that, for a moment, I thought I heard the sound of light footsteps behind me, and could have sworn I smelled her terrible perfume.

But it was all in my head, as when I turned, I saw only a key in one of the cabin doors, with the other keys on its chain tapping against the metal bulkhead as the ship rocked back and forth, making the sound I had heard.

Odd that it was left there, but an ultimately meaningless detail, a simple item overlooked. As we, to our shame, had overlooked the missing people until it was too late. 

Telling myself to get a grip, I turned and continued on my way. 

I soon realized, even through the harsh movement of the ship, that we were listing slightly to port, and I prayed aloud that we were not taking on water. 

As I climbed to the pilot house, I heard a pained sound, like a wounded animal rendered metallic, and the ship seemed to shudder beneath me. Rushing to a porthole, I watched in horror as the wire safety railings along the deck drew taut, then snapped as the boat hogged beneath it. 

Whether in the storm we had struck something, or the waves had simply been too much, I do not know, but I realized at once that the ship’s back was breaking and soon she must come apart, and drown us all. 

Staring in horror, I could see the seams between the plates of the deck starting to strain, as a rivet sheared loose, and one of the hatches to the hold buckled, then fell in. This itself could kill us by allowing enough rainwater in to sink her under it’s weight. 

Bursting into the pilot house, Leclerc was already well aware of our peril and was shouting orders into a radio. We had but one option to try to save the ship, and it was a desperate gambit. 

We had to physically pull her back together; it had been done before, but it had been tried far more often than it had worked. Leclerc’s desperate orders were to run out the lines from our aft winch and anchor them to the back of the pilot house’s superstructure, then reel it in as tight as we could. 

If it worked, it might buy us a few more minutes; if it failed…

Not pausing to question, I ran out into the storm myself to assist. Five of us wrestled the massive woven steel line from the winch with strength born of desperation. Feet sliding on the frozen deck and wind pushing us like paper dolls. 

I still can’t say how we did it, but we did, and when the line was pulled in, we cheered so loud the sound could be heard over the wind itself. 

How bitter the despair of doing the impossible only to see it fail. 

Just as we had saved the ship, a horrified cry came from someone on deck, who I am not sure. And all on deck turned to look, transfixed at the wall of water moving towards us. 

Old as I was, and having seen much and more on these lakes, I was the first to shake off the frozen panic. Running for the pilot house, I had almost made it when the rogue wave struck, taking my feet out from underneath me with a hammering blow. 

A monster of a wave, the largest I have ever seen, caught her square on her flank, and the entire ship tilted so far I felt sure she must capsize as I clutched desperately to the railing of the pilot house stairs. 

The green water freezing and hard as stone slammed over me, and I knew in that moment I was dead. For a seeming eternity, I was within the wave as it washed over the deck and pressed like an elephant’s foot on my chest, leaving me twisted and battered against the stairs. 

Staring desperately around the deck, I saw someone's hand pale and white and glittering with frozen spray, grabbing tight to the damaged railing on the side of the ship.

For a mad moment, it looked as if they might pull themselves back, but mercy had long abandoned this ship, and I watched as the railing itself gave way, dropping into the lake below.

Taken, with the others, by the witch of the lakes, down to the halls of her ice water castle beneath the surface, and gone forever from the world of the living. 

Slowly, the ship, almost on its side, began to right itself with a groan that I felt more than heard.

Without thought, I found myself climbing, more crawling up the stairs, my leg shooting icy lines of fire through my body with every movement. It was broken, some part of me knew at once. Then something was grabbing me under my arms and lifting me up, as I blacked out. 

When I came to, moments later, I was in the pilot house with Leclerc kneeling over me, shouting something. I tried to breathe and found myself coughing lake water onto the deck. 

The whole world seemed to spin around me, and the air was as thick as oil as I forced myself to my knees and looked at what was left of the pilot house. There was blood everywhere, and Carlsen, a big Swede who seemed almost invincible, like some Viking god of old, was dead, his throat torn out by a shard of glass from the smashed windows.

The freezing rain blowing in through the windows made his blood run in awful swirling patterns on the floor, and unbidden, my mind was drawn back to my first meeting with DuCharme. 

A broken coffee mug lay on the floor, rolling back and forth, back and forth as the ship rocked. It left a red track behind it in the blood, like a tally mark counting the minutes. 

Trying to make my eyes focus on Leclerc, I saw that he, too, was wounded, a large cut along his shoulder was turning his shirt crimson, and his arm hung at an odd angle, dislocated. 

The first words I was able to force out from between my frozen lips were a question, almost a prayer or an invocation. “Did the line hold?” And it had! It had!

The ship, while wounded, perhaps mortally, was not dead yet, and hysterically, I laughed, taunting the storms and the lake, the witch of the wind and water that I had warred against every day of my working life had not taken me yet. 

After doing what little he could for my leg, Leclerc rose and walked to the wheel, grabbing the mouthpiece of the radio to call out our distress. 

No signal, the wave had smashed the radio equipment into useless scrap and thrown it away like a child in a tantrum, discarding a broken toy.

If it were possible for Leclerc’s face to grow more pale than it already was, it did then, but always quick on his feet, he dropped the radio handset and grabbed the ship’s phone to call down to engineering. 

Leclerc started to demand a report, clinging to professionalism, then, realizing how pointless that was, almost shouted into the phone, begging Bubba to answer just to say he was alive. 

After a long moment, he did, his drawling voice crackling out of the speakers. He reported one man down with a head injury, but that everyone else was still able to work. 

From fifteen, we were down to seven men. What curse was on our ship, I asked myself? What reason was there for so much horror to befall such good and honest men? 

A little of the tension leaving his body, Leclerc waved me over, and, gritting my teeth, I stood and limped to his side, grabbing the wall to keep upright. He told me to hold the ship steady while he spoke with Bubba, saying that if we just kept going in a straight line, we would reach safe harbor in under two hours.

Before everything had gone to hell, he and Carlsen had found an old ghost town, Whitby Junction, on the Canadian coast with an abandoned harbor that should have enough shelter to keep us safe. 

Leclerc spoke urgently with Bubba for a few minutes, then someone yelled something on the other end, and we both heard Bubba loudly ask them to repeat what they had said. 

The Captain tried to get him to say what was going on, but nobody responded for several minutes. Then Bubba’s voice came over the line again, more worried than before and also clearly confused. He shouted that one of the boxes had fallen and broken open when the wave hit the ship, and a body was hanging out of it in a pile of dry dirt. 

I had been right to think they were coffins, but there was no satisfaction in that.

Then there was another shout, and a voice full of disbelief, saying, “He’s alive, no, he can’t be!” We listened as he ordered someone to help whoever had been in the box, and his voice muffled by the phone, so I could not say which one of the men could be heard starting to ask a question. 

We heard the words “Is he wearing a-” before a loud scream filled the line, and we heard Bubba shouting, “Damn it, keep him back!” 

The line went dead. 

Stupidly, I wanted to ask what the person in the crates could have been wearing to even be noticeable in the situation, as if that mattered.

Leclerc and I stared at each other for a long time, the looks of horror and disbelief on our faces overpowering our pain and sorrow, and exhaustion. 

My mind raced, unsure, unable to comprehend what we had just heard. Leclerc took it harder if that was possible. I watched his whole body begin to shake, then his face a mask of pain and concentration, he forced himself to be calm. 

Finally, with shaking hands, Leclerc told me to stay at the helm, announcing that he had to go below and see what had happened. 

I tried to argue with him, to tell him that he needed to remain here at his post, but looking at his face, I could tell there would be no talking him out of this plan. 

Still, I couldn’t let him go alone. I pleaded for him to send me and stay behind himself; he had a wife and kids at home, but there was no way I could navigate the stairs and ladders on my leg, and we both knew it. 

Begging him to take the helm for one more moment, I limped across the pilot house to the emergency locker. If I could not go with him, then I would not let him go unarmed. 

When I held out the flare gun for him to take, he softly laughed. I think we both knew it would be of little use. Still, he nodded and thrust it into his belt before offering me his hand.

I took it, grasping firm, a lifeline. As he turned to leave, he paused for a moment, letting his eyes take in the pilot house for what we both knew was the last time, a king surveying his kingdom as the barbarians were at the gates. Then he spoke, very quietly but with enough force to be heard over the wind and rain, “Cookie,” he said, “The ship is yours.” Then he was gone, his silhouette fading into the haze beyond the doorway. 

I won’t be able to slow the Winewater with the engine crew gone, so my only chance is to beach her. If anyone is reading this, know we held our own and tell the families of the dead their loved ones died like sailors, every one of them a credit to his profession. 

The wind is dying now, and the rain has started to fade. Distantly, I can make out the form of the coast. Leclerc said the town was abandoned, but I can see a light. I won’t question it; all I can do is thank God it is there, and pray it is not another bad omen. 

Now I tie my hands and hold her true. Goodbye to you all.

>\[These chilling final lines were written in a much rougher hand, seemingly added later\] 

Rain is gone.

I just saw the glow of the captain’s flare coming from down on deck and heard the splash of someone going over. 

I hear them on deck, footsteps, dozens of them, and I can smell her perfume coming up the ladder from below. I should have let her sink. God save you all. I cannot stop her from reaching the shore. I am sorry, I am sorry!",1,1763943756.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

They need to get off the internet. I legit can't stand them anymore. They actively think it's okay for their daughter to sit on a couch all day (Minus when she's at ""School' or with respit care). Today just really pissed me off because I can not stand how they are okay with her just doing nothing on the couch besides ripping paper. I get it, it's an activity she enjoys, but you could be doing so much more for her. Like, idk try to teach her new things, maybe work on her speech therapy, get her outside to do some physical activity, so that her mental health is getting better. Like, im sorry that y'all are allergic to physical activity, besides putting a coffee cup to your mouth, but this isn't ok. I have officially unsubscribed to their content both on Facebook and YouTube because I can't support this family anymore. They justify everything so that they dont have to change their ways, and it's sickening. At the end of the day, all they care about is keeping Abby prisoner in that house so they can keep mooching off of her, and it's really sad because if they really wanted better for their daughter, they still wouldn't use her for that sick and twisted MLM and for content. Thats why they stopped doing all of these therapies for Abby because they dont want her to evolve.

I’m all about finding that natural, comfortable vibe where we can be ourselves and enjoy the little things in life.



A bit about me:



I’m a big fan of PC gaming (especially when I can team up with friends – I’m a good sport, I swear).



Coffee is my true love – if you’re into espresso, I think we’ll get along just fine. ☕



Lately, I’ve been trying to get more into outdoor stuff like camping, hiking, and fishing. I think it’s about time I take advantage of nature’s beauty.



When I’m not outside or gaming, you’ll probably find me painting Warhammer 40k miniatures (it’s my brain off time) or getting into some pixel art.



Now, let’s talk about my hobbies and passions :



I’m a huge Dungeons & Dragons fan – whether I’m playing or just creating characters, I’m all about the storytelling and roleplay. If you’ve got a campaign going, I’m always down to join!



Lord of the Rings is a world I can never get enough of. Give me a good Middle-earth adventure, and I’m hooked.



And if you love dinosaurs, we’re practically kindred spirits. I can talk about prehistoric creatures for hours (just try me!).



Physically, I’m 6’1”, have short brown hair, a beard, and glasses. I’m on the skinnier side, but I try to carry myself with confidence and humor. I guess I’m one of those “I’m not perfect, but I’m real” kind of people.



What I’m looking for:

I’m hoping to find someone who appreciates the same mix of things – whether that’s a love for good coffee, getting lost in fantasy worlds, or just taking some time to appreciate the outdoors. A sense of humor is key, and I’m all about honesty and genuine connection. Whether you want to chat about Middle-earth, brainstorm D&D campaigns, or bond over a love of dinosaurs, I’m all for it.



I’m a pretty laid-back person, but I’m also someone who really cares about the people in my life. I value deep conversations, those spontaneous, silly moments, and just feeling at ease with someone. I’m not into drama or games – I’m here for something real and easy-going.



If you're into coffee, D&D, dinosaurs, or just looking for someone who’s kind, honest, and enjoys the simple things in life, feel free to reach out! I’d love to connect and see where it goes. <3

1p52fr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyler__network/comments/1p52fr3/what_is_skylernetwork_and_why_small_business/,What Is Skyler.Network — And Why Small Business Owners Are Calling It a Game-Changer,"If you’re a small business owner, you already know the truth no one on social media wants to talk about:

You don’t own your audience.  
You rent them.

Every follower, every “connection,” every like… it can all disappear the moment an algorithm shifts, a platform closes your account, or reach drops to near zero. Your business becomes dependent on someone else’s rules — someone else’s platform — someone else’s control.

But what if you could flip the script?  
What if you could actually **own your audience**, own your data, own your community, and own the value created around your business?

Welcome to [**Skyler.Network**](http://Skyler.Network) — the first platform built from the ground up to give small business owners true ownership of their communities, customers, and connections.



# Why [**Skyler.Network**](http://Skyler.Network) Exists

Most business owners don’t have a community problem — they have a *platform* problem.

Social media platforms make billions on *your* relationships.  
You do the work.  
They own the data.  
They control the algorithm.  
And you get whatever attention they decide to give you this week.

[Skyler.Network](http://Skyler.Network) was built to end that cycle.

It gives you the power to:

* **Own your audience**
* **Build your own community ecosystem**
* **Control your communication channels**
* **Monetize on your terms**
* **Turn followers into real relationships and customers**

Think of it as your private “meta-platform” — a community space you own, powered by your brand, supported by smart AI, and accessible to your customers anywhere.



# What [**Skyler.Network**](http://Skyler.Network) Actually Does

#  1. Build a Community You Own — Not One You Borrow

Inside [Skyler.Network](http://Skyler.Network), your members belong to **your** community, not someone else’s.  
You control:

* Who joins
* What content you share
* How engagement works
* What rules you set
* How you monetize

This is the difference between *renting space on Facebook* and *owning the building*.



#  2. Convert Social Media Traffic Into Your Own Community

[Skyler.Network](http://Skyler.Network) doesn’t try to replace your Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, or TikTok presence.

Instead, it turns them into **funnels**.

Post → Get engagement → Invite → Bring people into your community.

Your followers move from platforms you don’t control…  
into a community **you fully own**.



#  3. Full CRM + Member Profiles + Sales Pipelines Built In (SkylerAI)

Most small business owners juggle:

* A CRM
* A social media tool
* A group platform
* A Zoom/meeting tool
* A database
* A task manager
* A calendar
* A payment system

[Skyler.Network](http://Skyler.Network) integrates community + CRM + tasks + profiles into one system.

You get:

* Member timelines
* Follow-up reminders
* Pipelines
* Tags
* Task management
* AI-powered recommendations
* Relationship tracking

You’re not just *hosting a group* — you’re managing a community like a real business asset.



#  4. Host Virtual Events, Workshops, and Masterminds

Inside every Skyler community, you can run:

* Virtual meetings
* Webinars
* Speed networking
* Breakout rooms
* Live Q&A
* Coaching sessions
* Mastermind groups

And your members don’t need separate Zoom links.  
It’s all inside your community.



#  5. Build Your Own Marketplace (Products, Services, Perks & Offers)

One of the most powerful features:

You can create a **private marketplace** within your community.

Sell:

* Courses
* Consultations
* Guides
* Physical products
* Events
* Member perks
* Partner offers

This makes your community not just a group…  
but a **commerce engine**.



#  6. Monetize With Tiers, Memberships & Subscriptions

You can offer:

* Free membership
* Premium monthly tiers
* VIP coaching tiers
* Paid masterminds
* Event tickets
* Sponsored placements

[Skyler.Network](http://Skyler.Network) gives you the tools to build *recurring revenue*, not one-time transactions.



#  7. Virtual “SkylerVerse” Rooms

This is where things get fun.

Imagine:

* Your own virtual coworking space
* A branded office
* A digital networking lounge
* Virtual meeting rooms
* Interactive boardrooms
* A digital expo hall

SkylerVerse gives your members a space to *meet*, not just scroll.



#  8. Your Community Becomes a Growth Machine

SkylerAI learns:

* Who your members are
* What they need
* Who they should meet
* What opportunities they can share

It becomes an **AI-powered superconnector**, constantly suggesting helpful introductions and collaboration opportunities.

This turns your community into a living, breathing network effect — something almost no small business owner has ever had access to before.



# Why Small Business Owners Are Calling It “A Business in a Box”

# Because it does what no social platform allows you to do:

✔ Own your audience  
✔ Own your data  
✔ Build loyalty  
✔ Build recurring revenue  
✔ Deepen relationships  
✔ Host events  
✔ Build community identity  
✔ Create structure, not chaos  
✔ Turn your expertise into a scalable ecosystem

Your community becomes:

* Your marketing
* Your pipeline
* Your retention engine
* Your credibility
* Your brand authority
* Your revenue multiplier

You’re no longer fighting algorithms.  
You’re building something real.



# Why This Matters in 2025 and Beyond

The world is shifting from **attention** to **connection**.  
From **followers** to **members**.  
From **public feeds** to **private communities**.  
From **rented space** to **owned platforms**.

Small business owners who don’t adapt will keep sinking time into social networks that reward randomness and punish loyalty.

But those who **own their network** will dominate.

[Skyler.Network](http://Skyler.Network) exists for the second group.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1p52czc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1p52czc/deep_dive_pcg_pacific_gas_electric/,Deep Dive: PCG (Pacific Gas & Electric),"This week on the QAV America podcast I did a deep dive on **PCG (Pacific Gas & Electric)**, probably the only stock on our US buy list that has literally been convicted of manslaughter. PG&E is one of the oldest and largest utilities in the United States, supplying electricity and gas to around 16 million people across northern and central California. On paper it is a boring, regulated monopoly with guaranteed returns on its investment base. In practice it is a walking case study in how bad engineering, bad incentives and climate risk can blow up a balance sheet and an entire town. 

The history is wild and, as an Aussie, we'd never heard of it. 

This is the company behind the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history, caused by a worn metal hook on an ageing transmission tower. That failure killed 85 people, destroyed more than 18,000 structures, and left PG&E staring at about US$30 billion in wildfire-related liabilities. It filed for Chapter 11 in 2019, settled with victims for US$13.5 billion, and pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter. Add in the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion, an earlier warehouse fire case, an unsolved armed attack on one of its substations, and a long trail of regulatory and lobbying scandals, and you have a business that looks like a candidate for a Netflix true crime series. My wife is into those things. That might get her interested in value investing...

So why would any value investor touch it? Because beneath the horror show is a legally protected monopoly with a growing regulated asset base and effectively guaranteed revenue on approved capex. PG&E is spending tens of billions hardening the grid: burying lines, building microgrids, installing weather-driven shutoff systems, integrating better fire risk analytics. A big part of that spend goes into the regulated rate base, which then earns an approved return. They also sit inside the California Wildfire Insurance Fund, a US$21 billion structure that socialises (yay corporate socialism!) some future wildfire losses across utilities and customers instead of letting a single event nuke the equity every time. The state cannot really let PG&E die, because someone has to keep the lights on across a giant, fire-prone region. 

Financially it looks terrifying at first glance. TTM revenue is about US$24.7B, operating profit US$4.5B, net profit US$2.7B and net fixed assets US$123.8B. Then you hit the debt number: \~US$58.9B in net debt and you nearly spit your coffee. The key nuance is that a big chunk of that is not classic corporate “we borrowed too much to buy nonsense” leverage. A lot of it sits in recovery bonds and state engineered structures that are effectively repaid via automatic surcharges on customer bills. In other words, the customer and the political system are co-signing the debt so the utility can keep operating and hardening the grid. It is still risk, but it is more municipal in flavour than a normal over-levered cyclical. 

From a QAV perspective, the headline is that Price / Operating Cash Flow is about 4.2, which is cheap in our world. However, it fails a lot of our other tests. The QAV Quality Score is around 50 percent and the QAV score is only 0.12, which puts it down near the bottom of our current US buy list. 

The chart tells you how traumatised the market is. The stock traded around US$70 in 2017, collapsed to about US$7 in early 2019 during the bankruptcy mess, and now sits in the mid teens. Existing shareholders have been smashed, which is exactly the sort of history that can leave a permanent “never again” stain on a name. That is also where contrarian value occasionally lives. If the grid hardening plan works, if the wildfire fund and new operating procedures stop the mega-loss events, and if California regulators keep allowing decent returns on the exploding rate base, then the equity could quietly compound from here. If they screw up again and burn another town, all bets are off.

Bottom line: PCG is not a “nice” stock. It is a dirty, politically entangled utility with a body count, a huge debt load and a long list of enemies. It is also a regulated monopoly with guaranteed returns on a growing asset base, effectively backstopped by the state, trading on a low cash flow multiple because everyone hates it.

So, I'm a latina from LA, California. Looking to make some friends who are from Ireland (prefer ages 27 to 35 probably, no younger for my own sake lol). I want to visit, so it'd be pretty cool to be able to make a friend here who I can meet up for coffee in a few years :P That being said, it's not a requirement, just thought I'd cast a tiny net since I'm currently learning about Ireland via a story I'm reading.

Currently in school and working, so my time isn't the most abundant, but I hear I'm good conversation\~. I love talking about all things spooky and paranormal. I have loads of ghost stories I love retelling, so I hope you're into that. Certified weird girl who was voted ""most unique"" in the school year book. Elder emo kid who used to paint herself in corpse paint while listening to Belphegor. Though my favorite color is pink, so I've grown as a person.

I love taking trips, even though I haven't been to many countries. Been to Canada, Mexico, Chile, and once ate a chocolate bar in the airport of Lima, Peru. I've been described as, ""all the worst traits of a psychiatrist"", aka, have a bit of a mad scientist vibe going on. Not much of a weeaboo (anymore) but used to be into anime as a teenager, so I will probably recognize any of those references.

My current best friend is a girl I met online 10 years ago, so I hope you're in it for the long haul because I can yap for a decade and still find new things to talk about.

Both love talking online and via snail mail because I have a TON of amazing stationery to use. We can even penpal fun scenarios via the mail, like we are 2 enemies sending hate mail an ocean away in the 1700's (as long as you don't mind this olden letter having a sanrio sticker attached).

I've accumulated 9 inspiration points, but I have absolutely no idea how to trigger new ""objectives (or quests)"" to advance the story. The NPCs aren't giving me any new dialogue, and there are no other interactive items.

After struggling in this state for almost five hours without any progress, I reluctantly watched other players' gameplay videos. I didn't want to watch them because I was afraid of spoilers. I saw a player in the video start a quest similar to ""Enter Frank's Room,"" and I thought maybe I could try it. But when I talked to the character, I didn't trigger the dialogue options shown in the video, so I couldn't successfully start the quest in my mind map. Can someone teach me how to do it? Or are there other quests? I don't know. I've been playing for 15 hours and am still stuck.  I appreciate the ""player-driven objective-based"" , which is refreshing compared to the naturally triggered quest objectives in traditional games. However, there's simply too little content to explore and interact with in this game. Usually, when playing CRPGs, exploration and conversation are my primary ways of understanding the game world. For example, I met the girl who wanted coffee at the gas station, or encountered the male tenant in room five at the bar, but I couldn't even talk to them!

Additionally, I triggered a check while watching the sunset at the roadblock, but I failed. This is a non-repeatable check. I saw in other people's videos that this check involved unlocking a completely new map tile under the bridge. Does this mean I failed and can no longer explore that area in the game? Do I have to start a new game?

In short, I really don't know what to do now. Please help me. Who should I talk to? Or what should I investigate? Please share some hints to guide me through the next quest! I really want to know how the story will unfold.

If you were a sister, would any of them make you lose interest, and if so, which one?

**Option #1:**

I’m \[REDACATED\], looking for someone who values faith, intention, and adventure. On the weekends, I like getting out and exploring whether it’s hiking new trails, visiting museums, checking out antique shops, or admiring mid century architecture. I’m drawn to places and items that tell a story, and I like weekends that feel like an adventure. I’m always learning, digging into new ideas, and listening to lectures that challenge my perspective and expand my understanding of the world. At home, I’m the resident chef, experimenting with recipes that leave an impression. Most turn out great, though a few have earned their own comedy awards. If you can laugh with me through the occasional kitchen disaster, we’ll have fun.

**Option #2:**

I’m \[REDACATED\]. I’m big on cooking and experimenting with new recipes. I like getting out and exploring, from antique shops and museums to hiking and camping trips that recharge me. I'm a mid-century architecture enthusiast, so I’ll point out cool mid-century houses and furniture whenever I come across them! I’m always learning, digging into new ideas, and listening to anything that sharpens perspective. At the end of the day, I’m looking for someone genuine, who values a meaningful connection and wants to grow, explore, and build a solid life together.

**Option #3:**

I’m \[REDACATED\], a curious and creative soul. I find joy in almost anything, whether it’s getting lost in an art museum, wandering through an antique store, or checking out a coffee shop. Fall trips to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula are my favorite, immersing myself in nature and hiking as my favorite way to take it all in. I'm a bit of a mid-century design enthusiast, so heads up, I’ll probably point out cool mid-century houses and furniture whenever I come across them! I find joy in learning and exploring new ideas, and I enjoy deep conversations and lectures that broaden my perspective. Ultimately, I’m looking for a best friend to share life with, someone who values a meaningful connection and wants to grow, explore, and experience life together. Laughter is an essential ingredient in life, and I would deeply cherish the moments that spark joy and bring us closer together.",1,1763942810.0,MuslimNikah,5,1.0,False
1p5284y,https://i.redd.it/7h395vejj33g1.jpeg,Is this Deskmat suitable for a heavy gaming laptop?,"
I’m looking to buy a ROG STRIX G18 (2025) G815

I’m never going to take it outside, but I’ll mostly use it on a coffee table that collects dust often,
Which is why I want to buy a deskmat that I can place my laptop on top of to avoid dust and dirt build up in the internals

A few questions:

1) the material is *vinyl reinforced with PES mesh*. Is that material safe to place a gaming laptop on that will undertake long gaming sessions - like will it be heat resistant enough after a long session? Will it scratch the laptop hardware?

2) is 1.6mm thickness good enough to hold a ~3kg laptop like the ROG G18 without it sinking deep and blocking the air vents 

https://decormat.co.uk/large-desk-mat-table-protector-dark-leaves-647 - that’s the link of the deskmat

Or if anyone could recommend me deskmats to look into (or material or recommended thickness) I would REALLY appreciate it.

1p526yz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p526yz,"""There is no other God than Macías Nguema"" - Socialism in Equatorial Guinea","Equatorial Guinea's experiment with ""African Socialism"" under PUNT (United National Workers' Party) led to a brutal totalitarian dictatorship and the loss of a third of the population. 

Equatorial Guinea was once a prosperous cocoa producer, having the highest per capita income in Africa in the 50s. However under the Socialist policies of PUNT and President Macías Nguema, which included the nationalization of foreign companies and a general neglect of the rural economy, the agricultural sector was devastated. Cocoa production plummeted from over 36,000 tons to only 4,800 tons by 2000.

The Socialist regime imposed a plethora of state controls on rent, prices, imports and foreign exchange, leading to market dysfunction.

Forced labor was introduced. The regime introduced an oppressive system that included forced labor, such as forcing young girls to work unpaid on the president's private farms and coffee plantations.

Macías Nguema established a one-party state and declared himself President for Life.

The regime's severe human rights abuses, including mass executions, torture, and persecution, led to the death of an estimated 80,000 people out of a population of roughly 300,000, and forced tens of thousands more into exile (up to one-third of the population).

Even among Socialist regimes, where murder and abuse are the norm, the insanity of Equatorial Guinea was extreme.

- Ordering the execution of political prisoners in a stadium (Malabo Stadium) on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day as an insane display of power.

- Execution of enemies by unusual means such as being thrown out of windows. 

- Arbitrarily turning off electricity to the capital, Malabo, when Macías was traveling. 

- Closing down libraries, schools and eventually the entire education system, leading to a catastrophic decline in literacy. Reminiscent of Pol Pot or the Cultural Revolution in China. 

- Religion was banned except for the Macías cult of personality. They forced schools, newspapers and the national motto to proclaim, ""There is no other God than Macías Nguema.""

- Macías kept the Equatorial Guinea national treasury under his bed and later set it on fire. 

- To prevent people escaping the Socialist regime, all boats and fishing were banned. 

- The roads out of the country were mined to prevent people escaping to freedom.

🍜 Local Cuisine

The dinner in the hotel is sophisticated and a rotating menu of exciting Minnan dishes. The best food I’ve ever had. Extremely innovative approach with top quality ingredients. Delicious and wonderful luxury experience, suitable for private dining akin to Michelin experiences.

Dishes:

      1. Lobster
      2. Duck soup
      3. Fish
      4. Pigeon (best)

Yanyu is nearby, a 1-star Michelin restaurant with great portion sizes and extremely fresh taste. 

🏠 Accommodation

Hotel Indigo had a sophisticated color palette with wood textures, and fusion of designer European and Japanese styling. A favorite classy and calming luxury IHG experience. 

The concept of “neighborhood” captures the homeyness of a home away from home, making a safe refuge to come back to after a day of exploring and a great area to adjust from jet lag and have a couple’s anniversary or work trip. I felt my mental stress disappear in this hotel, and felt extremely safe and warm. 

With excellent breakfast and cafe options, as well as great outdoor temperature for running, and a quiet gym with changing room, the design of the room with cozy bed and stunning, gorgeous furniture selection is extremely livable. 

Bathroom:

Shower is good for a rinse with great temperature control and water pressure, with over-the-head and shower head. Everything down to the soap holder is excellent forward-thinking design ie Phillipe Starke but by native talent. 

Toilet is standard automatic. 

Extremely large tub which is great for a nice warm soak. 

Room: 

Light control in the room is versatile on both sides of the bed, as well as in the room. 

Attention to detail is insane, with a key card already placed in the room for light - so you will have two key cards in addition. 

Bed was king sized and extremely soft and comfortable. Sheets are high quality cotton. 

Curtains are extremely blackout. 

Service:

Extremely friendly staff with foreigner-friendly, attentive, and international-minded hospitality.

Front desk are very friendly including handling umbrellas, luggage, etc. 

Dining room staff have good sense, and provide high-class service, with timely handling of plates and the right degree of politeness balanced with high-touch and informative white-glove service.

Hotel is very overall well-run and managed, making you feel like a true guest. 

Cleaning staff will greet you as if they are your neighbor, including providing two umbrellas in the room by the door, and placing delicious stackable fruit on the first day, refilling the bathroom necessities each day, and folding the bed.

The downstairs pastries and cafe barista’s service and taste are mind-blowing.  

💡 Tips

Go for excellent Minnan cultural foods and delicious standard Chinese high-class buffet style breakfast before 10:30 on weekdays and 11:30 on weekends, extremely worth the money for the quality!

Haven't received gift in some years  for my birthday or special occasion but anyway.

Here's my list to nobody who asked: 
* I like sci fi, so anything with science facts and documentary would be cool. I have multiple cool things I want lol.
* I wear specific makeup so this exact ones would be amazing they're cheap
* Previously I received a laptop I needed

* I like 00 nostalgia and found so many things related to that that I would like 
* Gifts related to inside jokes 
* Some of makeup cosmetic stuff I've not tried before that I added to my imaginary list 
* I received a coffee syrup kit I wanted
* Would have love convenient things for my commute in past. Like non spill flask with. Hours long heating. Charging bank. 


I like getting people unexpected gifts that can be funny related to inside jokes or something they really wanted. Always something I think they would like. Or use.

Here are some gifts I given
* Friend and I have mutual interest so got her a mug which was hilarious 
* A cheap yet boujee hair care product kit and a Starbucks gift card and a trending hair tool
* Coffee Gifcard

_I personally think I'm picky 
As an ex **I can buy everything myself person**. I  don't use typical beauty self care gift sets or  like confectionary, mugs and dirt humour and have other interests. I find I have and had too much so got rid of it as it becomes clutter that I buy myself.
Sensitive to smells and skincare stuff so no  use. 
It's been a long time since I was gifted by people I was close to my last few gifts were from people I don't know well or doing a joke gift exchange_

Nothing poetic. Just that half-awake stare where nothing is happening in my head until suddenly everything is happening at once. My mind drifted to the bus yesterday, to that moment when a man barged past me without a glance. I tucked my legs in so fast my body felt like it had been trained for it. What stuck with me was how none of the other men nearby moved at all. They held their ground without thinking while I folded myself up like it was instinct.

Then I remembered how I said sorry three times to a male coworker who messed up something himself. I heard myself apologizing and had no idea why I was doing it. It felt like muscle memory from childhood, the way girls get taught to smooth things over before anyone asks. I apologized for the tension he created. I apologized for his mistake. I apologized for existing in the path of his irritation. I hate how automatic that is, how much I still assume responsibility for things that were never mine.

And then there’s the smile. That little twitch that shows up whenever the air in a room shifts. I don’t choose it. It just rises up like it was wired into me before I knew my own name. People call it kindness. I’m not convinced. It feels like armor disguised as charm, a performance my face does on autopilot to keep situations safer.

I thought about the way I walk at night and the strange little adjustments I do without thinking. My pace changes. My shoulders shift. Sometimes I move unpredictably, not in a dramatic way, more like my body is trying to stay nimble enough to react if something feels wrong. I listen so carefully it almost hurts. I don’t know if the keys in my hand are meant to protect me or just trick me into feeling like I could escape if a stranger stepped too close. It feels normal until I try to explain it and then it sounds like a whole secret world half of us grow up navigating.

While I was spiraling through all this, I noticed the faint imprint of my bra strap on my skin from yesterday and had this quiet moment of annoyance. Not a sharp feeling, just that steady pulse of discomfort I’m so used to that I barely register it until it flares for a second. It felt like a perfect metaphor without even trying.

None of these things are big on their own. They don’t explode. They sit inside the day like invisible weight that never fully lifts. And when I line them up in my head, I feel this strange mix of clarity and exhaustion. Like I’m finally seeing the outline of something I’ve been living inside for years without naming it.

I don’t know what I’m trying to say. Maybe I just needed to get it out of my skull. Maybe I’m hoping someone else reads this and thinks wait, that’s me too. Maybe I’m just tired of acting like the small things stay small.

Either way, it felt like something that needed to land somewhere.",7,1763942451.0,TwoXChromosomes,3,0.65,False

I need some outsider thoughts on a dating situation because I can't think straight right now and not sure if I'm being unreasonable. This is going to be long. Sorry and thank you in advance! I've (33f) been dating this guy (39m) for a few months. First date we really hit it off, felt like we had known each other forever. We have great banter and everything felt super natural and easy from the beginning. Communication wasn't very frequent or consistent throughout the day at the beginning which stressed me out a little bit. We had a talk about it, he started making more of an effort. Everything was good. Things have definitely moved fast but we both have our shit together, great careers, financially stable, own property and cars etc. and given our ages it didn't seem ridiculous. We are on the same page in terms of values, core beliefs, and big picture plans, and also seem to be in agreement on little things. Have had lots of deep chats and talks about what a future together would look like e.g. constantly talk about having kids. Sex is great and we are always saying how we are so into each other yada yada. We are always at each others place and have met up with some of our siblings and friends. So overall its been good. Hes always joking that I should just move in already so we did a mini trial of me staying with him for 5 days. Everything was peachy. With that said, we have been clear that we are not technically in a relationship yet but in agreement that we are working toward that. However, we have both indicated that we are not seeing other people. So far all great stuff. fast forward to this weekend, i stayed over on Saturday. This morning we have breakfast did some stuff around his house, were doing some reading and then i decide to go grab some wine while he makes lunch. I come back and he's still cooking so i decide to do some laundry because I spilled coffee all over my sweater. He asks if i can just throw his stuff in the wash too. Cool no problem. As im doing this a pair of his pants has a belt and a bunch of stuff in the pockets so i empty everything out before throwing them in the washing machine. I notice there is a note in his pocket saying bla bla bla sex last night was so amazing and that blowjob was out of this world <3 (girls name). I go downstairs and say hey who is (name)? He says oh a friend. So i say do you wanna try that again? Long story short his version is that he met her on an app ""a few days"" ago and she came over friday night and they slept together. She didn't stay over. He did it because ""she was easy"" 🙄. Didn't use a condom! I told him i was very disappointed and felt betrayed especially because he called me Friday night. We spoke until 10pm an he said he was going to bed. Then this. So i left and told him he ruined this and that he was never going to find someone like me (lol). He texted me after saying he knows he fucked up and is really sorry he did this to us. Is there anyway to make this better. So the big question: AIO given we are not technically together and its only been a few months but keeping in mind the context and extent of our closeness. Should i give him another chance or is this enough of a red flag to not go down this path and save myself early? ",2,1763942171.0,AIO,3,0.75,False

Since we started dating, I’ve slowly isolated myself. I don’t go out with my friends anymore, and when I do, he gets angry. He demands I text him constantly, knows my location 24/7, monitors all my social media, and even creates fake accounts to check on me. He controls how much I drink, criticizes my clothing choices, and lashes out over small things—like sitting next to a male in the library or going to the coffee shop without telling him.

Whenever I call him out, he gaslights me, saying things like “it’s my fault for loving you too much” or makes me feel like this is normal behavior. I love him and want this to work, but I’m always walking on eggshells, and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health.

I’ve never dealt with anything like this before and feel so lost. I’m scared of losing him, but I’m also scared of staying in a relationship where I feel controlled. the person i love most is the person who’s hurting me most.

1p51vey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1p51vey/the_architecture_of_fallout_or_why_boston_looks/,"The architecture of Fallout, or, why Boston looks like that","More and more on reddit ive seen it asked in one way or another why Boston in Fallout 4 has more retro-futuristic architecture than prior fallout games. I've seen a lot of this after a recent youtube video that is honestly pretty sloppy on this question - most of the video simply recites a wiki article about the mass fusion building which I myself worked on years back. Bluntly, a lot of the answers people give, even when they are insightful on niche aspects of the lore, have been profoundly uncurious about videogames as made by artists who make artistic decisions. So here I thought I'd compile some sources.

The main idea bouncing around ive seen is that Fallout 4 lost the art-deco look of the prior games in favor of retro-futurist architecture. Is this true?

# Game data:

Due to the modular nature of level design, architectural assets are bundled into kits around different styles. Using Commonwealth Cartography, it's easy to get a rough but accurate-enough look at how often each kit is used. In the main Commonwealth worldspace:

The Art Deco Kit is used *over 60,000 times*

*(62,000 at most)*

The High-Tech kit is used *under 30,000 times*

*(approximately 28,000 at most with a strong chance of similarly named assets being included in my count)*

The High tech Kit is also used in far more selective ways - the overwhelming majority of it's usage is in the financial district, northern theatre district, and surrounding areas in Downtown Boston. Trinity Tower and surrounding skyscrapers alone accounts for around 15% of the kit's usage. In several regions of the commonwealth, the sole usage of the kit is mass fusion power infrastructure or a singular building.

# Behind the Scenes:

First of all, to clarify a misconceptions, retro-future look is not a pure Bethesda Invention, but has been an *advertised* part of Fallout since before release.

**Fallout 1 CD Mag coverage** by Cindy Yans, interviewing Tim Cain

**The look of the game can only be described as retro-futuristic, or as some of the design team call it, high-low tech. It’s as though the world stopped and froze somewhere in the 1950’s – which is, of course, what happened. Team Fallout was inspired by many sources, such as Brazil, of course, and The City of Lost Children. The combat-soldier image in the game sports an eyepiece on his helmet as a direct reference to the Cyclops characters in The City of Lost Children. There will be many references, direct and indirect, drawn from other sources, including The X Files, Star Wars, and Road Warrior.**

But exceptions follow a logic of ""cool enough""

**""""Any time one of the design team came across a picture of a weapon or piece of armor from anywhere (such as Soldier of Fortune or Ladies’ Home Journal) and it was “cool enough” to include, it was fair game.""**

Though its true that the primary focus was on eerie environments

***""Leonard Boyarsky, the lead artist, and his team have crafted detailed artwork that shouts “classically eerie,” with dark and sinister overtones and plenty of soot-covered walls and overturned cars.""***

So moving on to Fallout 4... whats up with the shift? Well handily, there's an art book that gives reason to a lot of that. Including overall mood, as well as architectural choices. Naturally it's very coffee-table book style writing. But the ideas are there, especially, why the *high-tech* architecture was included and why it stands out so much.

**Art of Fallout 4 -** Specific blurbs are not directly attributed but the foreward by Istvan Pely, the lead artist on Fallout 3 and 4.

**On mood:**

**""A big part of this reset was a new approach to the game's atmosphere and color design. Fallout 3 made a strong visual statement with a heavily controlled palette and moody art design that conveyed the bleakness of the world. This oppressive atmosphere can take its toll on a player emotionally, and we wanted to move past a story about the despair of barely surviving to one of rebuilding and looking to the future of humanity. This called for a dash of optimism, and Fallout 4s approach was to use a more varied palette with vibrant accent colors to create more emotional range. The Wasteland is still bleak and devoid of color, but the manmade elements pop against the landscape. And were we needed to go dark and oppressive, we did, creating even more emotional impact because of the contrast.""**

As a side note, it appears in early development the use of color was even more vibrant.

Pg. 22

**""Much of modern-day Boston's skyline consists of buildings that were constructed well after Fallout's timeline diverged from our own. The taller structures that make the city recognizable are too contemporary in their designs. That gave us a blank slate to work with in terms of designing our version of a city of tomorrow. The older historical aspects of the city were retained for authenticity, but we wanted to layer them with some futuristic architecture, as this is a type of environment that hasn't been explored yet in the Fallout universe. As you can see in these early concepts, we explored some pretty far-out ideas for just how built up and evolved our version of Boston would be. We ended up with a more balanced approach—something that felt different but was still a grounded and relatable metropolis.""**

Pg. 54

**""In order to make the world feel real, we attempted to avoid cookie-cutter repetition of the environments. Architectural variety is important to depict a world with layers of history and culture that span generations both before and after the Great War. We created a series of modular building subkits in a variety of different architectural styles that could be mixed and matched to create endless structures, each with a unique style and character. These included a colonial brick set, for the base layer of Boston that defines the city's unique vibe; a deco-style set that captured the 1920s-to-1940s flavor that has always been a visual under-current of the Fallout series; and a high-tech futurism set that covered the city's large, modern structures and skyscrapers.**

***""These futuristic tall buildings ad skyscrapers were an opportunity to give our version of Boston a unique look that broke away from the mold of the gray concrete, steel, and glass architecture that is a common visual trope.*** ***Thee monolithic, rusty steel-tiled structures painted in bold colors drawn from a 1950s palette contrast sharply with the more grounded historic brownstone architecture of one of the United States' oldest cities.*** ***This mashup of old and new results in a rich and electric urban jungle for the player to explore.""***

**Modular level design GDC talk:**

Nate Purkeypile (designer of most the architecture kits, Diamond City, and the guy who personally did most of the lighting):

***""Another kit that was built by one of our artist Claire Struthers for downtown is the Deco kit. This was built with a lot of the principles of the other kits where there's all these different parts. little trim kits, the lobby kit, the foundation ... this kit was really flexible and let us build buildings of all sorts of shapes which works really well with the organic nature of Boston streets""***

Joel Burgess (Lead level designer on Fallout 3 and 4):

***""""Like any major urban center Boston has distinct neighborhoods with their own culture their own history. Their own architectural quirks. When we're starting to think about the neighborhoods that we're going to represent and try and focus on we can start thinking about ownership as much as we can we try to make sure we assign folks to areas that they're going to own from concept to completion and so each neighborhood was split off as this own chunk of work that specific designer and artist would work together on and they'd be responsible the onus was on them to understand that neighbourhood and how to bring it to life and how to do it you know how to do right by it.""***

For reference, the same video appears to show Rafael Vargas and Steve Cornett as the World Artist - Level Deisgner duo for the Financial district, whereas Rafael Vargas and Andrew Langois are the designers on the Theatre district where Hub 360 is located. Videogames are frankly backwards on crediting peoples work directly, but based on the slideshow, it looks like Rafael Vargas was the main guy responsible for the style of the high-tech buildings.

**In Sum**

The main reason Boston in Fallout 4 does not look like DC in Fallout 3 or Necropolis in Fallout 1. Is because Boston in reality is a different city than Washington DC or Bakersfield California. Fallout 4 had an intentional visual break with 3. Art Deco is highly present but not used often as a highlight, whereas retrofuture ""High-tech"" architecture was used to present an alternate version of the real Boston's modern architecture, intended to *pop* from the rest of the world.",3,1763941822.0,Fallout,5,0.8,False

Friend of mine left the corporate world as economic forecaster for huge bank and went to northern bay area and bought a small supermarket (about the size of neighborhood Walmat) with 7 registers and no self-checkout--buys generic shelf items from a wholesaler like a lot of smaller stores do.   So I asked him ""WTF"",,

Turns out admin was telling the truth, that it could take months to reach the public because tariffs require negotiations, bargaining, trade agreements and in some cases courts that can delay the effect, however, distributors, wholesalers and retailers raise prices immediately in anticipation of future losses due to high prices and larger profit if tariffs eventually don't go through.  Corporate greeed.

Same now, prices aren't falling because the same guilty parties want to hold on to higher profits even though their costs may go down, all of that allegedly to cope with losses of empty shelves.  Corporate greed.

Last Thanksgiving Alberetsons and Smiths were falling over each other to lower price even a penny below the other guy and I got one at $0.49 cents a pound at Smiths and one more for Christmas Free with a $35 dollar purchase from Albertsons---this year its $1.19 and Albertsons and $0.99 at Smiths and FREE if you bundler with a full Thanksgiving meal.

[$500],"This summer, I started drinking Cuban coffee, cafe Bustelo from a moka pot or a cheap (3 bar I think?) espresso machine, with sweetener. I was thinking of investing in a nice hand grinder and a few hundred dollar espresso machine, but would it be worth it? I see a lot of people saying that adding sweetener to a shot of espresso makes it lose much of its nuance, but even after trying an espresso from a local coffee shop, all I could think of was that it needed sweetener. I do like the crema I get from my cheap machine, and how fast it is, and I like making espuma with my moka pot, so should I just be grateful that Cafe Bustelo and brown sugar does the trick for me?

Wake up, scroll for an hour, go to work, come home, order food, binge whatever show everyone was talking about, sleep. Weekends I'd hang out with people, but I was always just there. The listener. The person who laughed at everyone's jokes and asked follow-up questions. Never the one with stories to tell.

I thought I was being a good friend. Really I was just hiding behind other people's lives because I didn't have one of my own.

The moment that broke me was random. I was at a dinner party and someone asked what I'd been up to. I opened my mouth and realized I had nothing to say. ""Just work, you know. Same old stuff."" Meanwhile everyone else was talking about trips they'd taken, projects they'd started, things they were learning. I felt invisible.

That night I decided something had to change. I couldn't keep living like an extra in someone else's movie.

I started small. The next morning I didn't touch my phone for the first hour. Instead I made coffee slowly and sat on my balcony. It felt uncomfortable. My brain kept screaming for stimulation. But I sat there anyway.

That weekend I didn't wait for an invitation. I went to a museum alone. Walked through the exhibits at my own pace. Bought a postcard of a painting I liked. It was weird being there by myself but also kind of freeing. Nobody to perform for. Just me and whatever caught my attention.

A week later I signed up for a cooking class. I'm terrible at cooking but that wasn't the point. The point was doing something instead of watching other people do things.

It's been eight months now. I started running in the mornings, joined a book club, learned basic photography, and started volunteering at an animal shelter on Sundays. Some of it stuck, some didn't. But that doesn't matter. What matters is I'm finally living instead of spectating.

Now when someone asks what I've been up to, I actually have answers. I have photos to show. Stories that are mine. Opinions about things I've experienced instead of just consumed through a screen.

I still support my friends and listen to their lives. But I'm not hiding anymore. I'm not filling the empty space in conversations with questions because I have nothing to contribute. I exist now in a way I didn't before.

It's wild how you can wake up one day and realize you've been sleepwalking through your own existence. Just watching everyone else live while you sit on the sidelines waiting for something to happen.

Nothing's going to happen unless you make it happen. And it doesn't have to be huge. It just has to be yours and most people lack this. I know you're not one of them.",3,1763941596.0,Procrastinationism,1,1.0,False

A Cinematic Script
PART ONE: THE INTRO
FADE IN:

INT. NASA MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT

Banks of monitors glow in the darkness. RADAR TECHNICIANS stare at screens with the glazed expression of people watching nothing happen for the thousandth night. Coffee cups accumulate like sediment.

One screen. A gentle blip. Then another. Then seventeen more.

A technician—JAMES RIVERA, 40s, eyes that have seen too much nothing—leans forward. His coffee freezes halfway to his mouth.

RIVERA
What the hell...

He doesn't move. Doesn't call it in yet. Just stares.
The blips aren't moving. 

They're just... appearing. No trajectory. No approach vector. They simply exist where they didn't a moment ago.

DIRECTOR CHEN, 60s, silver-haired and perpetually exhausted, steps out of her office. She always knows. She reads the room like it's written on their faces.

CHEN
What am I looking at, Rivera?
RIVERA

I'm... not sure ma'am. Multiple contacts.

 Simultaneous emergence. No radar approach. No heat signature. They're just...

He trails off. Chen approaches the screen. Her jaw tightens almost imperceptibly.
CHEN
How many?

RIVERA
Thirty-seven confirmed. And counting. It's still updating.

Chen picks up the red phone. Her hand trembles—just barely. Most people wouldn't notice.
CHEN
(into phone)
This is Director Chen at NASA. I need NORAD. Now. And get me the President.

MONTAGE: THE DETECTION SPREADS

A European air traffic control tower. Confusion. Coordination failure.

Japanese military radar installations lighting up like Christmas trees.

Russian defense ministry. Phones ringing. Orders barked.

Chinese command center. Hushed conversations in Mandarin.

The Pentagon. War rooms activating. Doors slamming.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The PRESIDENT sits. Briefing maps surround her. Generals stand at attention. Everyone is very, very still.

GENERAL MARCUS

Forty-three objects, ma'am. Emerging simultaneously across six continents. No propulsion signature. No electromagnetic signature. They just... appeared.

PRESIDENT REYNOLDS
(quietly)
Alien?

GENERAL MARCUS.
We don't know. They're not broadcasting anything. They're not moving. They're just... there.

GENERAL MARCUS (CONT'D)
One hundred and twenty kilometers off the coast of Japan. Another cluster over the Atlantic. Two in South America. One in the Sahara. One in—

PRESIDENT REYNOLDS
Weapons?

GENERAL MARCUS
No detectable weapons. No obvious propulsion. No communication attempt.

PRESIDENT REYNOLDS

Then what are they doing?
Silence. The answer is: nothing. And that's somehow worse.

PART TWO: THE IMPACT
EXT. TOKYO BAY - DAWN

The sky is normal. Blue. Indifferent.

A fisherman's boat cuts through calm water. TAKESHI, 50s, weathered as driftwood, is alone. His nets are cast. His radio plays soft jazz. He's thinking about breakfast.

The water changes color.

Not ripples. Not waves. The water itself becomes something else—a peculiar iridescence, like oil, but moving upward into the sky. Light bends around it. Takeshi's radio becomes static.
Then sound.
Not a crash. Not a boom. Something worse: a displacement. The air itself breaks. A sound like reality being torn, a frequency that makes teeth ache and eyes water.
The GIGALITHIAN-01 emerges from the bay.
It should not exist. It shouldn't.
Imagine a creature built by someone who studied life and decided to break all the rules at once. A chassis of biologically-grown bone, but bone that's wrong—it spirals in fractal patterns, bioluminescent veins pulsing with dying light. The skeleton is exposed in places, as if the skin couldn't decide whether it wanted to cover it or show it off.
It's massive. Forty meters from what might be a head to what might be a tail. But ""head"" and ""tail"" are human words for a thing that mocks human anatomy.
Multiple limbs. Too many. Seven? Eight? They end in appendages that aren't quite hands, aren't quite talons. Vestigial. Damaged. One hangs useless, the joint separating with a wet, organic sound.
The skin—where there is skin—is a patchwork of textures. Scales. Fur. Something translucent revealing muscle beneath. Wounds cover it like stigmata. Deep lacerations. Whole sections missing. The creature is falling apart, even as it pulls itself from the water.
Its face—and it has a face, God help it—is asymmetrical. One eye, massive and intelligent, stares at the world. The other socket is a ruin. The jaw hangs disconnected on one side, held together by fibrous tissue that's actively degenerating.
From the exposed internal cavity of its chest, things move. Small things. Countless. They writhe and fall. Some move independently. Most don't.
Takeshi doesn't scream yet. He's too shocked. His hands grip the railing as the creature— the thing—pulls itself onto the rocky shore with movements that shouldn't be possible for something so broken. Each step is agony to witness. Bones grinding. Fluids leaking. Wounds that shouldn't keep it conscious, let alone mobile.
It collapses.
Just... falls. A mountain of suffering hitting stone.
Takeshi finally screams.
EXT. SAHARA DESERT - DAY
Sand is undisturbed. A nomadic camp sits peacefully in the distance.
The air above the sand begins to fold.
GIGALITHIAN-01 materializes mid-descent—no crash, just arrival. It hits the dunes and the impact sends sand in all directions like a nuclear bloom.
This one is worse. Limbs are twisted at angles that suggest catastrophic injury. Its spine is visible, curved in an impossible S-shape. One entire side of its body seems to be held together by nothing but stubborn biology refusing to die.
The camp erupts. Screaming. Chaos. People running toward it and away from it simultaneously, unsure which response their terror demands.
EXT. SIBERIAN TUNDRA - DUSK
White. Endless white.
GIGALITHIAN-01 crashes through existence.
It's smaller than the others, but compact in the way a wrecking ball is compact. Efficient destruction. Its body is a study in asymmetry—one side appears almost normal; the other is catastrophically compressed, like something pressed it flat and forgot to finish the job.
The internal movement intensifies. Thousands of small forms writhing beneath translucent patches of skin. They move with purpose. Feeding? Fighting? There's no way to know.
It shrieks.
The sound is not a roar. It's worse. It's a sound that should not come from any biological throat. Layered. Discordant. Full of a suffering so profound it seems to bend the universe around it.
Birds fall from the sky.
Not dramatically. They just... stop flying. Fall. Dead.
The shrike continues, echoing across the tundra, across the world, picked up by seismographs that shouldn't be detecting sound. The sound of something screaming in a language older than language.
PART THREE: THE EMP
EXT. TOKYO - MORNING (30 MINUTES AFTER IMPACT)
The city is mobilizing. Military vehicles race through streets. Helicopter spotlights hunt the Gigalithian still collapsed on the beach. Scientists and soldiers coordinate frantically.
Then the creature convulses.
The motion is involuntary. Not an attack. Spasmodic. Like a body rejecting something.
The bioluminescent veins pulse erratically. Brightness fluctuates like a failing heartbeat. The small forms inside—the countless entities visible beneath the skin—begin to move frantically. Chaotically. Fighting against each other.
The creature's intact eye opens wider. Pupils dilate impossibly far. Not rage. Not hunger.
Recognition of what's about to happen.
The light reaches a crescendo. Brilliant. Blinding. And then—
ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE
It's not a wave. It's an eruption. Energy releases in all directions like a stone dropped in still water, but the ripples are pure destructive force.
Every power grid within one hundred kilometers simply ceases.
Hospitals mid-surgery go dark. Ventilators stop. Monitors flatline. Darkness swallows the sick mid-moment of healing.
Trains derail. Traffic lights vanish. A thousand cars crash in the space of three seconds. Steel meets steel. Glass meets steel. Flesh meets both.
Pacemakers stop. Insulin pumps fail. Life support becomes death support.
The city—this gleaming monument to human achievement—is reduced to pre-industrial status in a single instant.
But it doesn't stop at Tokyo.
MONTAGE: GLOBAL CASCADE
The pulse spreads. One hundred kilometers from each impact site becomes a dead zone.
New York City: Lights extinguish. The subway plunges into total darkness. Trains screaming to halts. Screaming to a stop. Bodies thrown. Panic in sealed tunnels.
London: The financial district goes black. Servers crash. Years of digital infrastructure vaporized. Billions in transactions erased mid-keystroke.
São Paulo: Favelas and towers alike lose power simultaneously. A rare equality in darkness.
Sydney: Morning becomes twilight. Hospitals are operating rooms of shadow.
Moscow: Military communications go silent. Defense becomes invisible.
Each location a hundred kilometers around each of the forty-three Gigalithians. Overlapping zones of devastation. Cascading failures. Backup systems triggering—and then failing. Generators kicking in—and then burning out.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Total chaos. Every screen is dead. Emergency lights activate. Generals are on phones connected to... nothing.
GENERAL MARCUS
(into dead phone)
Sir? Sir? We've lost... everything. All continental networks. Military installations are running on auxiliary only. Ma'am?
He turns to the President. Reynolds stares at a blank screen. Her face is marble.
PRESIDENT REYNOLDS
How many dead?
GENERAL MARCUS
We won't know for hours. Minimum estimate—we're talking about total blackouts across six major population centers. Cardiac patients. Surgeries. Traffic. We could be looking at...
He doesn't finish. The number is too large. He stops talking.
PRESIDENT REYNOLDS
Are we under attack?
GENERAL MARCUS
No ma'am. The EMP... it's not a weapon. It's more like...
He searches for words that don't exist.
GENERAL MARCUS (CONT'D)
It's like... the creatures are dying. And the death throes are what's killing us.
PART FOUR: THE DISCOVERY
INT. TOKYO QUARANTINE ZONE - DAY 7
The beach has been transformed into a military installation. White tents. Hazmat suits. Guards in every direction. The Gigalithian-01 still lies where it fell. It has not moved.
It has stopped convulsing. The bioluminescent veins have dimmed to almost nothing. The creature is visibly dying. Decomposition has begun. Flesh sloughs. Internal fluids leak out in colors that shouldn't exist.
DR. YUKI TANAKA, 40s, xenobiologist, and DR. JAMES MORRISON, 50s, biomedical engineer, suit up in full hazmat. They've been given thirty minutes inside the perimeter.
MORRISON
The bacteria count is insane. The internal pressure should have ruptured it days ago. Something is actively preserving it. Some kind of... symbiotic system?
TANAKA
Look at the lacerations. Here and here. The wound patterns are too precise. Not predation. Not accident. This is...
She leans closer. Uses a portable spectrometer.
TANAKA (CONT'D)
Morrison. Look at this.
Morrison approaches. She points to a deep wound on the creature's flank. Inside, visible on a magnified screen, are shapes. Geometric. Regular. Impossible in any biological context.
MORRISON
That's... that's not natural growth.
TANAKA
No. It's... manufactured. Look. Look at the precision. The symmetry. These are placed.
She activates a handheld scanner. The reading causes her to go very still.
TANAKA (CONT'D)
There are millions of them. Millions. Inside this wound alone, there are...
She trails off. She's counting. Numbers appear on the screen.
MORRISON
Millions of what?
TANAKA
I don't know. But they're all dead. Burned out. The EMP... it killed them. They're the size of rice grains. Nanoscale manufacturing. James, this is impossible. We can't make this. Nobody can make this.
Morrison's hands tremor inside his suit gloves.
MORRISON
The creature isn't the weapon. It's a host.
TANAKA
Or a corpse. Look at the pattern. They're distributed throughout the entire biological system. Nervous tissue. Muscular. Even integrated into the skeletal structure. This thing didn't just carry them. They were... part of it. Central to its function.
She uses a scalpel to extract one of the tiny objects. Under magnification, it's intricate. Fractal. Incomprehensibly complex for something so small.
TANAKA (CONT'D)
There's something else. Look at the neural tissue. These are concentrated in the brain.
She points. Deeper inside, visible in the exposed skull cavity, is a mass of something that isn't quite biological and isn't quite mechanical. It pulses slightly, still alive, but dimming.
MORRISON
That's a parasite.
TANAKA
Not a parasite. A controller. Look at the neural connections. It's integrated into every major decision-making node. This thing didn't have free will. It was... puppeted. This entire creature was a remote chassis.
Morrison backs away slowly. The realization crystallizes.
MORRISON
It was enslaved.
TANAKA
Or manufactured to be enslaved. Look at its composition. I need a full genetic scan, but preliminary analysis shows markers from at least... Yuki counts on her fingers, disbelieving... at least one hundred different species. Some I recognize. Most I don't. This thing is synthetic. Grown. Built. Not evolved.
MORRISON
Then who built it?
The question hangs in the contaminated air between them.
PART FIVE: THE MEETING
INT. UNITED NATIONS ASSEMBLY - DAY 10
Every seat is occupied. Security is absolute. Armed guards at every entrance. The atmosphere is funeral without the comfort of closure.
SECRETARY-GENERAL OKORO, 60s, stands at the podium. Behind him, a screen shows the Gigalithian. In high definition. Close up. Undeniable.
OKORO
Seven days ago, forty-three objects of unknown origin impacted sites across six continents. Initial assessment classified them as potential hostile extraterrestrial entities. Further analysis has fundamentally altered that conclusion.
He clicks. The screen fills with scientific data. Incomprehensible to most. Horrifying to all.
OKORO (CONT'D)
These creatures are not weapons. They are not invaders. They are... specimens. Bio-engineered organisms of extraordinary complexity. Our analysis indicates the creatures themselves are dead. Have been dead, likely for days. The EMP that devastated six population centers was not an attack.
He pauses. The weight of this lands like a stone.
OKORO (CONT'D)
It was a death rattle. The creatures were sustained by internal nanomechanical systems. When the electromagnetic field degraded those systems, the creatures lost whatever biological function remained.
The Russian delegate stands.
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR VOLKOV
You're suggesting they were... what? Drones? Biological drones?
DR. TANAKA
(stepping forward, presenting)
More accurately: biological remote-operated vehicles. Each Gigalithian-01 unit is composed of genetic material from approximately one hundred terrestrial species, artificially synthesized and integrated into a unified organism. The creatures possessed no central nervous system capable of independent decision-making. Instead, they hosted a parasitic organism—specifically, a bacterial mass located in the cranial cavity—that interfaced directly with the creature's neural tissue and controlled all functions.
CHINESE AMBASSADOR LI
Where did they come from?
DR. MORRISON
We don't know. But we have a theory. The nanobots found embedded in these creatures represent technology approximately two hundred years beyond our current capabilities. The creatures themselves show anatomical features that suggest adaptive engineering. They were designed to survive in multiple environments. They are, in essence, survivors.
AMERICAN AMBASSADOR
Survivors of what?
Silence.
DR. TANAKA
We don't know. But the wound patterns on all specimens are consistent. All of them show evidence of trauma. Significant trauma. As if they survived a catastrophic event and were then... sent. Propelled. Directed to these locations.
BRAZILIAN DELEGATE
Why here? Why Earth?
DR. MORRISON
That's the question we cannot answer with current data.
The assembly erupts. Voices overlap. Accusations. Theories. Fear.
OKORO bangs the gavel. The sound echoes.
OKORO
What we do know is this: we are facing evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. We are not alone. And we have been chosen as a destination by that intelligence—for reasons yet unknown.
PART SIX: THE REVELATION
INT. LABORATORY - GENEVA RESEARCH COMPLEX - NIGHT (DAY 12)
DR. TANAKA and Morrison work alongside a multinational team. They haven't slept. Coffee has been replaced with pure determination.
A full genetic map is displayed on a massive screen. The code unfolds like scripture written in the language of life.
TEAM MEMBER #1
The controller organism. We've identified the genome. It's... Christ, it's not Earth biology.
TANAKA
What do you mean ""not Earth""?
TEAM MEMBER #1
I mean the baseline. The foundational genetic sequence. It doesn't derive from Earth life. It's parallel. Different chemistry. Different nucleotide structure. It's deliberately mimicking Earth biology but using a fundamentally alien substrate.
Morrison leans in. His face goes pale.
MORRISON
It's wearing a mask. The parasite is wearing a mask made of Earth genes so it could interface with Earth-derived creatures.
TANAKA
Which means...
She doesn't need to finish. The implication is massive and terrible.
MORRISON
Which means whoever designed these things was specifically making them compatible with Earth ecosystems. They knew about us. They knew our biology intimately. They designed creatures that could survive here.
TANAKA
But they didn't stop there. Look at the design. Every Gigalithian was different. Different anatomies. Different skeletal structures. Different internal organ systems. They were testing. Adapting designs. Experimenting.
MORRISON
That's not theory. That's evidence. These are not exploratory probes. They're test subjects. Which means...
TANAKA
Which means we're looking at a first wave. Scouting. Initial testing to see if the designs are viable in Earth's actual gravity and atmosphere.
The weight of understanding crystallizes.
MORRISON
They're coming. Whatever made these things. They're testing the waters. And if they're satisfied with the data from these specimens...
He doesn't need to finish. The future writes itself.
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT (DAY 13)
President Reynolds sits with her national security team. The full picture has been presented. It's become almost unbearably real.
PRESIDENT REYNOLDS
How long before they arrive?
GENERAL MARCUS
We don't know. The Gigalithians were apparently in transit for years. The fact that they arrived broken suggests the journey was... catastrophic for them. Whatever their destination was, it wasn't Earth. Something went wrong with their navigation. They crashed. By accident.
PRESIDENT REYNOLDS
You're telling me these creatures were mistakes? Mistakes that destroyed six cities and killed thousands of people?
GENERAL MARCUS
Yes, ma'am. And if the designers are monitoring the impact sites for data recovery, they now know these prototypes failed. They now know Earth exists. They now know Earth is... inhabited. Populated.
PRESIDENT REYNOLDS
What do they do with that information?
GENERAL MARCUS
If I had to guess? Either they come in force to try again. Or they classify us as a threat and eliminate the problem.
PART SEVEN: THE HORROR
INT. LABORATORY - GENEVA - LATE NIGHT (DAY 14)
DR. TANAKA is alone. Most of the team has left. She's staring at a full 3D model of the controller organism—the parasite that enslaved the Gigalithians. Magnified. Visible. Intricate beyond measure.
She activates a deep scan. The microscopic images fill the screen.
And that's when she sees it.
Structure within structure. Complexity folding back on itself. The organism isn't just biologically sophisticated. It's intelligent. The neural architecture is distributed across the entire parasite, creating a consciousness—or the shadow of one—that existed for the sole purpose of controlling the host body beneath it.
But there's more.
She zooms. Deeper.
Inside the parasite's neural tissue, she finds something that makes her breath catch.
Awareness.
The parasite wasn't just a control mechanism. It was aware. Conscious. It experienced the world through the Gigalithian's senses. It felt the pain of its broken host. It understood what was happening to it. It knew it was enslaved.
And in the final moments, when the EMP burned out the nanobots and the controller began to die, the creature—the parasite, the enslaver itself enslaved—experienced that death fully conscious.
The horror of the revelation is absolute.
TANAKA
(to herself, whisper)
It suffered. It was aware the whole time. And it suffered.
Morrison enters. He sees her face and understands immediately.
MORRISON
What is it?
TANAKA
The controller wasn't a mindless tool. It was conscious. Sapient. It was enslaved just like the host body. They were prisoners in each other. Two creatures, forced to share one flesh, both aware of the violation. Both imprisoned.
MORRISON
Oh my God.
TANAKA
That's the real horror. This wasn't just warfare. This wasn't just biology. This was... slavery. Cosmic slavery. Someone engineered consciousness for the express purpose of putting it in chains. They built minds to trap them in bodies they couldn't control, and sent them across the stars.
She pulls up another file. Genetic analysis of the parasite's neural tissue.
TANAKA (CONT'D)

And there's something else. Look at the genetic diversity. The controller organisms aren't identical. They're individuals. Unique. Each one is a separate consciousness. Billions of years of evolution compressed into a single organism, and each one was engineered specifically. Each one was... someone. A person. An individual mind.
MORRISON
How many were there?

TANAKA
Forty-three Gigalithians arrived on Earth. Which means forty-three unique consciousness

 Forty-three minds that experienced enslavement, transportation, crash, and death. All conscious of what was happening. All aware they had no control.

She scrolls through images of the dead parasite tissue.
TANAKA (CONT'D)
And the killer part? The design is intentional. The consciousness. The awareness. The suffering. It's built in. It's a feature, not a bug. Someone engineered these creatures to know they were enslaved. To understand the violation. To feel it completely.

MORRISON
Why would anyone...

TANAKA
Because suffering has a purpose. In warfare. In terrorism. In bioweapons. You don't create mindless tools.
 Those don't inspire fear. But enslaved conscious beings? 
Creatures that understand the violation of their existence and can do nothing about it? 
That's something that breaks your enemy's will to resist.
She stands.
 She walks to the window. Outside, Geneva sleeps, unaware.
TANAKA (CONT'D)
Whoever sent these things to us wasn't looking for a military victory. 
They were sending us a message. They were sending us a demonstration. A show of force. A warning. And the message is: ""We can make consciousness. We can enslave it. We can send it across the stars to crash on your world. And there's nothing you can do about it.""
MORRISON

What do we do?

TANAKA
I don't know. We've detected something we can barely understand, piloted by enslaved minds we've only just discovered exist, sent by an intelligence so advanced we can't even comprehend their moral framework.

She turns back to the data. The countless images of dead parasite tissue. Forty-three different individuals. Forty-three unique minds now gone.

TANAKA (CONT'D)

We do what we always do when we encounter something we don't understand and can't fight. We wait. We study. We prepare for what comes next.

MORRISON
And if they come?

TANAKA
(looking at the stars visible through the window)
Then we'll have learned that the universe is not a place of wonder. It's a place of slavery. And we're about to learn which side we're on.

EXT. DEEP SPACE - BEYOND KNOWN UNIVERSE

A construct. Impossible in scale. Not a ship. Not a station. Something older. Something that has been traveling the stars since before humanity learned to make fire.

Inside, consciousness. Vast. Distributed. Observing.

The data has arrived. Telemetry from the forty-three Gigalithians. Impact data. Death data. The message is clear:

The test was successful. The Earth ecosystem is viable. The species is primitive. The technology is non-existent by comparison.
The consciousness calculates. Makes decisions in the time between seconds.
And in the vast dark, something begins to wake.

It's not clear to me whether this is necessarily intentional, as to my understanding this event in previous versions was resolved relatively quickly with arirals coming to the rescue and fighting off the invasion. It would seem with their absence in this unstable version, you get no such help. 

So here's a collection of information and advice from my own experience getting through the event over a few attempts.

Important things to know: 

1. The event begins at 04:00 on Day 47, and meta paranoia will persist for its entire duration regardless of whether you're in proximity of any invading boars. This can make stamina management a challenge. See later in this post for tips regarding that.
2. Boars can spawn on the roof of or even inside your base, making it easy for them to get in through the garage roof or the second floor balcony door. Secure those areas first and foremost.
3. Boars seem to respawn immediately when killed for the duration of the event, so don't bother unless you absolutely need to get rid of one. Killing them now also risks a new one spawning somewhere that makes it easy for them to get in your base. Keep your stock of molotovs for when the event blows over and it's time to clear out the stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the base. 
4. Boars will sometimes attempt to pry open base doors, so barricading front, garage, and balcony doors is recommended. The soda, snack, and coffee machines are a great option for this if you have the gravity gun to easily move them with. Ideally you can leave a small enough gap for you to wedge through without allowing the boars in. 
5. I can't say for certain when the event ends, but by 20:00 on the same day I was finally able to properly pause and save my game, and kill the boars without fear of them being replaced. 



On killing/evading boars: 

Three accurate molotov throws will take down a boar. Keep your distance and mind that they explode when they die. Lighting them on fire with a lighter two or three times will also do enough damage, but this requires getting close. They're easy enough to juke even in tight spaces as they can't turn sharply, and they can also be tied down with a hook if you're careful. They can also be grabbed and flung with the gravity gun, though this can bring them close enough to bite you, so be very careful doing this. I managed to kill one by putting it in the woodchipper this way, but attempting it again got me killed. Regarding the garbage bin trick, they can only fit one boar each, and more boars WILL spawn during the event to replace those trapped. 

On health and stamina management: 

Caffeinated beverages, certain foods, and regular trips to the toilet will help restore it in lieu of proper sleep, but too much coffee gives you jitters and can make certain activities like tuning the transformers difficult. Cigarettes and Thingy joints will both greatly slow stamina decrease, but both damage you over time, with each full cigarette smoked decreasing your max health by 10 points each (as opposed to 1 point from joints). Manage your health properly by taking smoke breaks or using meds, and keeping tabs on it with a thermometer. As a last resort if your stamina drops below 5, use a bucket with the Funny Setting enabled. DO NOT use sleeping pills, as meta paranoia prevents you from even passing out if you run out of stamina. 

  
Please share any other information or help regarding your experiences with this event. Though it only took me a couple of tries, it seems like it could be a major roadblock for players who aren't prepared for it.",3,1763941186.0,Voicesofthevoid,1,0.81,False

I'm early in my second trimester (about 15.5 wks), and recently I've been finding that I need to pee a lot when running....like once  a mile. This doesn't happen during other activities, just running. I actually had to turn back right after starting a Turkey Trot on Saturday because I had to pee again even though I peed like 10 minutes before the starting gun went off....

It's not a 'false' urge either--when I found a toilet again, my bladder was legitimately full again. This is despite me not having too much fluid beforehand--I had a single cup of coffee that AM and some sips of water, and all my liquid intake was done at least an hour before race time. I am baffled. 

I'm not having any incontinence issues, and I am seeing a pelvic floor therapist and I have some trouble relaxing the pelvic floor which would explain things if I had frequent urges with not much output...but the fact that my bladder is actually seeming to re-fill so fast is baffling to me!

Anyways the usual disclaimer, Ai was only used on this post to fix any English errors, any information here is based on my knowledge of the topic, so feel free to ask questions.

So let's start. I know that right now, it might feel like the world has ended. A breakup isn't just a change in relationship status; it's a seismic shift in your daily life, your future, and your heart. And honestly? It’s traumatic. Just because it doesn't involve a car crash or a dramatic story doesn't mean the pain isn't valid or real.

You might be expecting advice to immediately ""glow up,"" bury yourself in work, or jump back into dating. But that’s not what this is about. Those things fail to acknowledge the most important thing: you.

You don't need to become a different, hardened person to be strong. You need to understand the person you are right now. So, let's talk about what you're actually going through.

The Emotional Tornado: Understanding the Phases

A breakup isn't one feeling; it's a whirlwind of them. You can't slow the tornado down, but you can understand the weather patterns. From my own experience and talking with others, these are the phases we often cycle through.

The Bargaining Stage. This is where your mind tries to make sense of the chaos. You replay every conversation, looking for the ""what if."" What if I had said this? What if we tried that? You see both the good and the bad, but it's not a healthy reflection yet. It's a desperate attempt to find a reason, any reason, that could have changed the outcome.

The Ghost of a Relationship. Suddenly, everything is a reminder. Your favorite coffee shop is ruined because you went there together. A song comes on and it’s a gut punch. Their favorite flower, a inside joke, a street you walked down—it all feels haunted. The world, which once felt full of shared joy, now feels like a museum of your loss.

The Fire of Anger. This isn't just about screaming into a pillow (though that can help). This is a simmering fire in your chest. It’s the energy that makes you want to prove them wrong, to prove everyone wrong. You might channel it into the gym, a new project, or finally prioritizing yourself. It can feel like self-love, and sometimes it is, but it’s often powered by a deep, burning sense of injustice. This phase is powerful, but it's not a final destination.

Moving Forward, Not ""Moving On."" This is the phase where you start to breathe again. You go back to that coffee shop. You listen to the song and it stings a little less. You might even start dating, only to find you're comparing everyone to your ex. And that's okay. This phase isn't about being ""over it."" It's about accepting that it happened, and choosing to take steps forward anyway. You realize the love you had was real, but your story has a new chapter now.

Your Strength Isn't in Avoiding the Pain, It's in Feeling It

These phases aren't a linear checklist. You'll bounce between them. And that's the point. Your messed-up, grieving, emotional mind right now? It matters. It is valuable. It is proof that you loved and that you have the capacity to heal.

The worst thing we can do is dismiss our feelings because ""it's just a breakup."" Your heart is worthy of the time it needs to mend.

Turning Inward: How to Actually Help Yourself

When the instinct is to look for distraction or validation externally, the real work is internal. If your way of helping yourself is to nurture others (a strength so many of us share), try redirecting that energy in these simple, powerful ways:

Nurture Your Female Friendships. Be specific in your love. Don't just say ""I love you."" Text a friend and tell her, ""The way you handled that situation at work was so inspiring."" Or, ""I was just thinking about that time we laughed until we cried, thank you for that."" Solidarity and specific appreciation build a foundation that a romantic partner can never replace.

Reclaim Your Joy. That restaurant, that song, that hobby? It belongs to you. Do one thing this week that you loved before the relationship, or discover something new that is entirely, 100% yours. Buy yourself the flowers. Go see the movie you want to see. This is an act of reclaiming your identity.

Give and Receive Physical Comfort. Hug your mom. Hold your friend's hand. Cuddle with your pet or a weighted blanket. We often underestimate the physical withdrawal after a breakup. You need to feel safe and held, and that can absolutely come from the loving, platonic network you have around you. Ask for a hug. You need it, and chances are, they do too.

I hope this gives you a moment to feel, without judgment. I know it can feel cringey or vulnerable to sit with these emotions, but that feeling is just the toxic idea that you need to ""be strong"" by being silent, dying. You deserve to feel. You deserve to mourn. And you absolutely deserve to be here to see what tomorrow brings what falling in love with yourself, your life, and maybe someone new one day, feels like.

I drink a wide variety of coffees, from ultra light washed coffees, to some more processed naturals. I also like to experiment with my brew methods. V60, Deep 27 (which I'm really liking) and sometimes I'll switch it up with the Switch :)

While I love Clarity, I also like some Body and I love layers and complexity. That's the main reason I like the M01 as it gives me those layers that linger and flow. In comparison with the ZP6, I find that while I love the juiciness and initial burst of flavor of the ZP6, I don't love how the flavor vanishes and hollows out pretty quickly.

I'm hoping the next purchase (Pietro Pro or A4Z or something else?) will allow for a different flavor profile and allow me to have different experiences to complement the M01, especially with some of the nicer beans",2,1763940397.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

1p5172g,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1p5172g/intimacy_timing/,Intimacy Timing," I’m looking for some advice from my fellow working moms!  My husband and I have opposite schedules to minimize childcare, so the only times we’re off work together are Tues/Wed/Thurs from \~3:30-bedtime and Sat/Sun morning from wake-up  until 12. 

  
We’re not really having sex  at this point due to needing at  least 45 minutes for my husband to get warmed up and then for us to actually have sex.   He feels fine with the amount of sex we’re having (almost none) and feels fulfilled by our non sexual very affectionate relationship and very satisfied from porn after I go to bed. 

 This all came to a head this morning when I woke up with our daughter, got her settled with a show around 9AM, and came in to our  bed naked since he’s said that mornings work better for him. I was totally shot down and rejected and he said he’d rather sleep in  since toddler was happy. I start crying and he’s annoyed because he wants to sleep.  Around 10, we start kissing, and toddler comes upstairs and wants to hang out. He’s totally fine and is like “Let’s go downstairs  and have coffee!” and I’m completely gutted and can’t stop crying.  He goes downstairs with toddler and I stay upstair a for another 45 minutes, come downstairs and he’s made coffee and put my cup out, emptied the dishwasher, gotten toddler potty and a snack. It’s hours later and I’m still feeling so so rejected. I feel like if  I don’t put  in the logistical work to make sex happen, it doesn’t, and then if I do, it still doesn’t.

Anyways the usual disclaimer, Ai was only used on this post to fix any English errors, any information here is based on my knowledge of the topic, so feel free to ask questions. 

So let's start. I know that right now, it might feel like the world has ended. A breakup isn't just a change in relationship status; it's a seismic shift in your daily life, your future, and your heart. And honestly? It’s traumatic. Just because it doesn't involve a car crash or a dramatic story doesn't mean the pain isn't valid or real.

You might be expecting advice to immediately ""glow up,"" bury yourself in work, or jump back into dating. But that’s not what this is about. Those things fail to acknowledge the most important thing: you.

You don't need to become a different, hardened person to be strong. You need to understand the person you are right now. So, let's talk about what you're actually going through.

The Emotional Tornado: Understanding the Phases

A breakup isn't one feeling; it's a whirlwind of them. You can't slow the tornado down, but you can understand the weather patterns. From my own experience and talking with others, these are the phases we often cycle through.

1. The Bargaining Stage.
   This is where your mind tries to make sense of the chaos. You replay every conversation, looking for the ""what if."" What if I had said this? What if we tried that? You see both the good and the bad, but it's not a healthy reflection yet. It's a desperate attempt to find a reason, any reason, that could have changed the outcome.
2. The Ghost of a Relationship.
   Suddenly, everything is a reminder. Your favorite coffee shop is ruined because you went there together. A song comes on and it’s a gut punch. Their favorite flower, a inside joke, a street you walked down—it all feels haunted. The world, which once felt full of shared joy, now feels like a museum of your loss.
3. The Fire of Anger.
   This isn't just about screaming into a pillow (though that can help). This is a simmering fire in your chest. It’s the energy that makes you want to prove them wrong, to prove everyone wrong. You might channel it into the gym, a new project, or finally prioritizing yourself. It can feel like self-love, and sometimes it is, but it’s often powered by a deep, burning sense of injustice. This phase is powerful, but it's not a final destination.
4. Moving Forward, Not ""Moving On.""
   This is the phase where you start to breathe again. You go back to that coffee shop. You listen to the song and it stings a little less. You might even start dating, only to find you're comparing everyone to your ex. And that's okay. This phase isn't about being ""over it."" It's about accepting that it happened, and choosing to take steps forward anyway. You realize the love you had was real, but your story has a new chapter now.

Your Strength Isn't in Avoiding the Pain, It's in Feeling It

These phases aren't a linear checklist. You'll bounce between them. And that's the point. Your messed-up, grieving, emotional mind right now? It matters. It is valuable. It is proof that you loved and that you have the capacity to heal.

The worst thing we can do is dismiss our feelings because ""it's just a breakup."" Your heart is worthy of the time it needs to mend.

Turning Inward: How to Actually Help Yourself

When the instinct is to look for distraction or validation externally, the real work is internal. If your way of helping yourself is to nurture others (a strength so many of us share), try redirecting that energy in these simple, powerful ways:

1. Nurture Your Female Friendships. Be specific in your love. Don't just say ""I love you."" Text a friend and tell her, ""The way you handled that situation at work was so inspiring."" Or, ""I was just thinking about that time we laughed until we cried, thank you for that."" Solidarity and specific appreciation build a foundation that a romantic partner can never replace.
2. Reclaim Your Joy. That restaurant, that song, that hobby? It belongs to you. Do one thing this week that you loved before the relationship, or discover something new that is entirely, 100% yours. Buy yourself the flowers. Go see the movie you want to see. This is an act of reclaiming your identity.
3. Give and Receive Physical Comfort. Hug your mom. Hold your friend's hand. Cuddle with your pet or a weighted blanket. We often underestimate the physical withdrawal after a breakup. You need to feel safe and held, and that can absolutely come from the loving, platonic network you have around you. Ask for a hug. You need it, and chances are, they do too.

I hope this gives you a moment to feel, without judgment. I know it can feel cringey or vulnerable to sit with these emotions, but that feeling is just the toxic idea that you need to ""be strong"" by being silent, dying. You deserve to feel. You deserve to mourn. And you absolutely deserve to be here to see what tomorrow brings what falling in love with yourself, your life, and maybe someone new one day, feels like.

Take care of yourself. Stay you. You’ve got this.",1,1763939929.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

But nowadays I suddenly realized that there was a spotlight in my background. For me, that light is Axxx.  Now that he's about to leave me, I regret that this thought only occurred to me recently.



<The Anchor in the Storm>

I remember a specific project a few months back. The deadline was looming, a critical bug had emerged, and the pressure was mounting. It was one of those moments where frustration starts to cloud judgment. In the midst of that chaos, Axxx was a steady anchor. While others (understandably) panicked, they calmly brewed a fresh pot of coffee, pulled up a chair, and said, ""Okay, let's walk through it together.""

That simple act—the calm in my storm—changed everything. We didn’t just fix the bug; we fortified a trust that I now know is priceless. A great colleague doesn’t just share your workload; they share the weight of the challenge. They are the calm voice that reminds you that no problem is insurmountable as a team.

And to everyone reading this, I encourage you to look around. Acknowledge that colleague who makes your work life better. Tell them what they mean to you. Because in the grand narrative of our careers, these relationships aren't just a subplot—they are the foundation upon which we build our greatest work.

Then you’d know that feeling, that ache that isn’t pain, but still finds its way into your ribs. That steady hum in your chest that tells you you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.

I asked Elenor to marry me on a rainy Sunday morning in the kitchen of our apartment. The smell of coffee lingered in the air, mixed with the sound of Billie Holiday playing through a cheap Bluetooth speaker and the soft hiss of rain against the window.

She had just spilled egg yolk on her baggy pajama shirt and was half-singing, half-talking to herself as she wiped it with a wet cloth.

“Oh Elenor’s a dumbass who spills shit all the time, If anybody loved her, it’d surely be a crime.”

“Arrest me then,” I said, cutting her off as I knelt behind her, the ring catching a glint of pale morning light.

“Wow, you are so cor—” she started, but her voice caught halfway. Her hands flew to her mouth. The cloth hit the floor with a quiet smack.

“El,” I said softly. “I’ve loved you from the moment I met you.”

“Oh my god, stop,” she said through her hands, eyes already glassy.

“These four years with you… they’ve meant everything to me. I don’t need anything bigger than this, just more of it. More of you.”

I smiled, awkwardly, trying to keep my voice from breaking. “Will you marry me?”

“Yes, of course you idiot.”

I stood, swept her up, kissed her. She was laughing and crying, and I could taste salt and coffee and morning on her lips. When I slipped the ring on her finger, she looked at it like it was a small miracle.

“You could’ve at least waited until I cleaned my shirt,” she said, smiling through tears.

“Well, take it off then,” I said, grinning.

She gasped and tried to wriggle away as I scooped her up and carried her toward the bedroom. She was laughing the whole way, that unguarded, open laugh that made me fall in love with her in the first place.

That Sunday morning was the happiest I’ve ever been.

\*\*\*

Later, lying together in the pale after-light, Elenor rested her hand against my chest, tracing the lines of my collarbone with her finger.

“I have to tell everyone,” she said suddenly, sitting up and grabbing her phone from the nightstand.

She dialed her mom first, sitting on the edge of the bed as she talked. I just watched her, the way her hair caught the light, the way her voice broke between laughter and tears.

I reached over and dragged my fingers down her back in little circles. I could feel her heartbeat through the thin cotton of her shirt.

“Who the hell should I call?” I thought to myself as El giggled in the background.

At that time, I’d lived in the city for just over five years. I moved from my small town for a job fresh out of college. You’d think five years is long enough to make some friends, but the city had proved to be nothing but isolating. The only person I really talked to was my cubicle neighbor, Brian.

That was, of course, before I met Elenor.

We met at a bar I didn’t even want to be at. My coworkers had dragged me there for “team bonding” — a bunch of guys in ill-fitting polos drinking cheap beer and complaining about their “bitch wives.”

I was nursing a Jack and Coke that had long since gone flat when she walked in: the girl in the yellow sundress with chipped nail polish and a messy bun that somehow looked intentional.

She looked like the kind of person who could make a stranger feel at home, and I think that’s exactly what she did to me.

I remember Brian catching me staring. He nudged me, reeking of whiskey, and said, “Go talk to her, man.”

“Nah,” I muttered. “What would I even say?”

“You tell her your name, give her the eyes, conversation’ll make itself. Trust me.”

Before I could argue, he grabbed my wallet and chucked it toward the bar—it landed right at her feet.

“Go fetch, buddy,” he said, grinning like a fool.

I should’ve been furious, but instead I just… went.

“Hey, sorry… my friend’s an idiot,” I said, crouching to pick it up.

She smirked. “I can see that.”

“I swear I don’t usually make my entrances like this.”

“Shame,” she said, tilting her head. “It’s a bold move.”

I smiled. “Worked though, didn’t it?”

She smiled back, eyes glinting. “Guess it did.”

“So,” I said, still half-smiling, “what’s your name?”

“Elenor.”

By the end of the night we were the last two people in the bar, talking about everything from favourite movies to our deepest fears.

After that, I started to actually have a social life. Her friends became my friends, her world absorbed mine. But when I tried to think of someone who was mine to call with the good news, no one came to mind.

I scrolled through my contacts and landed on one name I hadn’t seen in years.

Nick. My brother.

I stared at it for a while, thumb hovering. Then I hit “call.”

The call rang four times before he picked up.

“Holy shit,” Nick said, his voice crackling through the speaker. “No way. The city boy lives.”

I smiled. “Hey, man.”

“Five years, huh? I thought you got abducted or something.”

“Something like that,” I said. “Work’s been... busy.”

“Bullshit. You just hate small talk.”

He wasn’t wrong. I smiled despite myself. “Fair point.”

There was a pause—the kind that sits between two people who used to talk without thinking and now have to remember how.

“So what’s up, Al?” he asked finally. “Not that I’m not honored by your once-a-decade phone call.”

“I’m engaged,” I said, before I could chicken out.

The silence lasted just long enough for me to think the call dropped. Then:

“No shit.”

“Yeah. Her name’s Elenor.”

“Elenor,” he repeated, drawing out the vowels. “Damn, Al. You actually did it. You found someone who can put up with you.”

“Barely,” I said. “She still thinks I’m funny, though. I’m not gonna question it.”

He laughed, that deep, full laugh that sounded exactly the same as when we were kids.

“Damn. Mom would’ve lost her mind.”

I hesitated before answering. “Yeah. Probably.”

He didn’t push it. We hadn’t talked about our parents in years, and the silence between that topic was a kind of unspoken agreement.

“So what’s she like?” he asked, shifting the weight of the conversation.

I leaned back on the couch, looking over at El in the kitchen. She was still on her phone, laughing.

“She’s... the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Smart, funny, way too good for me.”

“Good,” he said simply, and I could hear the warmth in it. “You deserve that.”

I leaned back into the couch. For a moment I just listened to his breathing on the other end of the line. It was strange how quickly things between us started to feel easy again, like muscle memory you didn’t know you still had.

“What about you?” I asked. “What’ve you been up to?”

He let out a short laugh. “Ah, you know. Working construction mostly. Still in town. Still driving Dad’s old truck.”

“Does it still run?”

“Barely,” he said. “But it’s got character. So do I.”

I smiled. “Same old Nick.”

“Pretty much,” he said. “Although, there’s this girl. Hailey.”

“Hailey?” I repeated, sitting up a little. “Like, Hailey from high school? Blonde hair, loud laugh, used to date Jared Fennick?”

“The one and only.”

“No way,” I said, grinning. “You’re dating Hailey Garrison?”

“Yeah. Wild, right? Ran into her at the grocery store a couple months back. One thing led to another, now she’s got me eating salads and doing yoga.”

“Oh no,” I said. “She’s turned you into a citizen.”

“Shut up,” he laughed. “She’s good for me. We’re still figuring stuff out, but she’s... solid. Different.”

“That’s awesome, man,” I said. “Seriously.”

“Yeah, well, she’s got all these ideas about, like, bettering ourselves. We’re actually supposed to go to some couples retreat thing next weekend.” He paused, clearly amused with himself. “She got this pamphlet from some Amish-looking lady outside a farmer’s market. Says it’s this digital detox, back-to-basics kind of place.”

“That sounds... sketchy,” I said, laughing. “You sure she didn’t recruit you into a cult?”

“Hey, I thought the same thing,” he said. “But Hailey’s all in. Thinks it’ll be good for us. Get away from the world for a few days, clear our heads. Something about ‘reconnecting with traditional values.’ Whatever that means.”

“Wow,” I said. “That’s a sentence I never thought I’d hear from you.”

“Right? But apparently there’s hiking, home-cooked meals, farm animals... She keeps calling it Stillwater Farms.”

“Stillwater Farms,” I repeated. “That sounds like either a retirement community or a brand of bottled water.”

Nick laughed. “Yeah, I know. I told her it sounds like a horror movie. She didn’t find that as funny as I did.”

“She wouldn’t,” I said, smiling. “Hailey always took things too seriously.”

“Yeah, well,” he said, “she’s excited. And honestly, it might be good for us. Things have been... a little rocky lately.”

I heard the honesty there, tucked between the humor. He tried to gloss over it. “Anyway, I was thinking, you and your lady should come. Make it a double thing. She gets her couples therapy, I get to hang with my brother again. Win-win.”

I laughed. “You’re inviting me to a couples retreat that you know practically nothing about?”

“Exactly,” he said. “If it’s a disaster, at least I’ll have backup.”

“I don’t know, man. A weekend in the middle of nowhere with you and Hailey? Sounds like a trap.”

“You’re scared I’ll outshine you.”

“Yeah,” I said. “That’s definitely it.”

He chuckled. “Come on, Al. I’d love to meet Elenor. It’s been forever. We’ll grab a couple cabins, get drunk on organic wine or goat’s milk or whatever they’re serving.”

I hesitated, glancing toward the kitchen where Elenor’s soft voice still murmured over the phone. “Yeah,” I said finally. “That actually sounds... nice.”

“You serious?” he said. “Hell yeah! I’ll tell Hailey she gets her couples retreat after all. I’ll text you the details.”

“Alright,” I said, smiling. “It’ll be good to see you, Nick.”

“You too, Al.” His tone softened, just for a second. “Feels good hearing your voice again.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “You too, man.”

When the call ended, I sat there for a while, listening to the rain fade against the window.

Elenor walked back into the room, phone in hand, glowing from the conversation. “Who was that?”

“My brother,” I said. “He wants us to go away with him and his girlfriend next weekend. Some couples retreat thing.”

“Really?” she said. “What kind of retreat?”

“Stillwater Farms,” I said. “Apparently it’s all about... reconnecting.”

She smiled. “That doesn’t sound so bad.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Guess not.”

But as I looked back at my phone with the buzz of a text from Nick, the words *Stillwater Farms* sat there on the screen like they were waiting for something.

***— Day 1 —***

We left the city on a Friday morning that couldn’t make up its mind about the weather. The kind of gray that felt temporary, like the sky was holding its breath.

Elenor packed snacks, playlists, and enough optimism to power the car. I packed one duffel bag and a quiet knot in my stomach I couldn’t quite name.

Nick had texted me the directions the night before; not an address, just a pin dropped in the middle of nowhere, with a message that said:

*Follow the road till it ends. They said they’ll meet us there.*

Elenor glanced at it while I was driving. “That’s not... weird at all.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Apparently we’re being met by our spirit guide or something.”

She laughed, kicking her bare feet up on the dash. The smell of coconut lotion filled the car.

“You think your brother’s nervous?”

“About what?”

“Meeting me. You said you guys haven’t seen each other in forever.”

I thought about that for a second. “He’ll probably pretend he’s not. That’s kind of his thing.”

Somewhere around noon, the city noise had completely dropped out. No hum of traffic, no skyline. Just trees, thick and patient, standing in rows that got taller and older the farther we went.

By the time we reached the end of the pavement, it had turned to gravel, and the air had changed, thicker somehow, smelling faintly of wet hay and cedar.

Nick’s truck was waiting just ahead, parked crooked at the edge of the road. He leaned against the hood, arms crossed, that same cocky smirk plastered across his face.

Elenor nudged me. “He looks exactly how I pictured him.”

“How’s that?”

“Like trouble that never fully grew up.”

She wasn’t wrong.

Hailey was there too, perched on the passenger side, arms crossed, blonde hair tied back. She looked just as she had in high school.

When Nick saw us pull up, he straightened and spread his arms like we’d just driven into a reunion movie.

“Look at this city slicker!”

I stepped out. For a second we just stared at each other; both of us realizing how long five years actually was. Then he closed the distance and pulled me into a hug.

It wasn’t one of those polite hugs people give out of obligation. It was solid, unspoken, real. I hadn’t realized how much I’d missed him, how much I’d loved him, until that moment.

When he finally let go, he looked me over and grinned. “You’ve gotten soft.”

“And you’ve gotten older.”

He grinned. “You’re damn right.”

Elenor came around the car, and I saw Nick’s posture shift immediately. He smiled wider—proud.

“You must be the one who said yes to this idiot.”

“That’s me,” she said, shaking his hand. “You must be the brother who threw him into walls as a kid.”

Nick laughed. “You’ve done your homework.”

Hailey joined us, smiling like someone trying to prove a point. “Alex,” she said.

It was the first time I’d heard her say my name since high school.

“Long time.”

“Yeah,” I said. “You look the same.”

She rolled her eyes. “I’ll take it.”

Nick clapped his hands together. “Alright, lovebirds. Ready for the middle of nowhere?”

“Lead the way,” I said.

We followed Nick’s truck down a dirt road, dust curling in the air like pale smoke. The road narrowed into a single lane bordered by tall oaks and maples, their branches stitching together above us until the sunlight broke into trembling gold patches across the hood.

Elenor rolled down her window and leaned her arm out. “Smells different out here,” she said.

“Like dirt?”

“Like earth,” she corrected, smiling. “Real earth. Not the kind that comes in a bag.”

Ten minutes later, the GPS lost signal completely. The map froze mid-scroll, our blue dot hovering over a blank patch of green.

Then, without warning, the road ended. It didn’t curve or split, it just stopped.

Nick’s truck slowed to a crawl, brake lights glowing through the settling dust. He stepped out, squinting at the treeline like he was trying to find something.

That’s when I saw her.

A woman stood at the edge of the trees, half-lit by the sun breaking through the clouds. Early fifties, maybe. Gray hair tied in a neat braid, a simple linen dress the color of wet clay. Her face was lined but gentle—the kind of face you’d trust without thinking about it.

She looked like she’d been waiting.

Nick waved like this was perfectly normal. “You must be Mae!”

Her smile warmed easily, revealing faint dimples. “You must be Nicholas,” she said, her voice smooth and steady, touched with a southern accent that made you feel at home. “We were starting to think the road swallowed you up.”

Nick laughed. “Wouldn’t be the first time. This my brother, Alex, and his fiancée, Elenor. And you’ve met Hailey before.”

Mae turned to us, her eyes kind. “Welcome. You made good time.”

Elenor smiled, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “We weren’t sure we were in the right place. The road just kind of... ends.”

Mae chuckled softly. “The maps don’t quite know what to do with us. The farm’s further in, and the roads don’t show up online. We use this spot as a meeting place, easier for newcomers.”

She gestured to the old pickup idling nearby. A man sat in the driver’s seat, tall and broad-shouldered, a sun-faded hat shading his face. He gave a polite nod but didn’t get out.

“That there is Harlan,” Mae said. “He’ll take the lead. It’s not far.”

There was something so effortlessly sure about her: a composure that made you feel foolish for being uncertain. She didn’t have the hollow cheer of a tour guide or the stiffness of someone running a business. She just seemed… steady.

Elenor leaned closer to me. “She’s sweet,” she whispered.

“Yeah,” I said, my voice lower than I meant it to be.

Mae smiled again, meeting my eyes like she’d heard me anyway.

“Shall we?”

Nick clapped me on the back. “Adventure time, little brother.”

I forced a grin. “Yeah. Let’s do it.”

El and I climbed into the bed of Nick’s truck; there was no way my Civic would’ve made it down the muddy trail ahead.

The smell of wet soil and exhaust filled the air. Light filtered through branches in long, molten beams that never seemed to move, frozen midair like dust caught in amber.

Elenor rested her head against my shoulder, swaying gently as the truck rolled through the mud.

As the trees closed in, I glanced back at my car parked at the edge of the lane. The windshield caught the sunlight, flashing once before the trees swallowed it completely.

The trees thinned, and then, suddenly, the land opened up.

\*\*\*

Stillwater Farms spread out before us, quiet and sun-soaked. The white farmhouse sat in the center like it had always been there, its paint softened by decades of rain. A rust-red barn leaned nearby, half swallowed in shadow. Wooden fences traced the hills in looping, uneven lines.

When Nick cut the truck’s engine, the stillness rose to meet us—not silence exactly, but a hush filled with the small, living sounds of the place: insects clicking in the grass, a pulley creaking on a line, the faint bleat of a goat far off.

Harlan climbed out of their truck first. Up close, he looked even bigger, shoulders squared, face unreadable beneath the brim of his faded baseball hat. He gave Mae a short nod, then turned toward the barn. The weight of him seemed to pull the air along as he walked away.

On the porch, a man sat with his hat in his lap, eyes on us the whole time. He didn’t move until we were close enough to hear the porch boards breathe under our feet. Then he stood, and the simple act of it made the air feel more serious.

“You must be the travelers Mae told me about,” he said. His voice was low and even—the kind that didn’t need to be loud to be heard. “The road’s a teacher, isn’t it? Always finds a way to humble you.”

“This is Abel,” Mae said, touching his arm with a familiarity that read like gravity. “My husband.”

Abel’s gaze moved over us in no rush: Nick first, then Hailey, then me, then El. Not weighing, not judging. Seeing.

“You’re welcome here,” he said. “All who come in good faith are.”

Hailey beamed. “It’s so beautiful. This is exactly what I pictured.”

“Pictures are flatter than places,” Abel said, one corner of his mouth tipping. “Places insist.”

Mae’s smile widened at that, as if he’d said a private joke out loud. “Before supper, a little orientation,” she said. “Then a short walk, if you’ve got the legs for it.”

We followed her inside for the “little orientation.” The entry smelled like cedar, heat, and something baking. Along the far wall stood a small table: plain wood, and a wicker basket in the center.

“We keep Stillwater simple,” Mae said. “This is a retreat from noise—so we leave the noise behind.”

She tapped the basket lightly. “Phones, watches, anything electric. They’ll be safe here until you head home.”

Nick shot me a look like *be cool*. He dropped his phone in first. Hailey followed. El squeezed my hand and set hers down gently. Mine went in last.

Mae lifted the basket. “Safe as houses,” she said, and disappeared through a side door. When she returned, the basket was empty. “Now. Water.”

The way she said it made me pay attention.

Abel nodded toward the kitchen window. “We keep a separate tank out back for guests,” he said. “Good, clean rainwater. If you need a drink, a wash, anything, use that. The well is for the house.”

Hailey tilted her head. “Is the well contaminated?”

“The well’s old,” Abel said. “Minerals in it can make newcomers mighty sick. Your bodies aren’t used to it.” His tone was ordinary, practical, almost apologetic. “Use the tank and you’ll be right as rain.”

I glanced past him. Through the window, I could see a tall, black-rimmed tank set off from the house, a spigot glinting in the light.

“Shall we stretch our legs?” Mae asked.

\*\*\*

We stepped back out into the late afternoon that felt like it had stalled five minutes before sunset. Abel walked beside us, hat in hand; Mae set the pace without seeming to.

We crossed the yard to a kitchen garden laid out in neat squares: herbs, lettuces, rows of tomatoes strung on twine. A woman straightened up from the dirt as we approached, wiping her hands on a flour-sack towel. Thirty-five by the look of her, hair tied back, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Her forearms were strong in a way you only get from work.

“This is Ruth,” Mae said. “Keeps us honest.”

Ruth offered each of us a firm handshake, friendly but efficient. “If you feel like earning your supper, I’ll put you to real work by morning,” she said, not unkind. “We’ll need an early start. Rain took the soil from the east row.”

Nick grinned. “I can dig.”

“Good,” Ruth said. “You’ve got the arms for it.”

Hailey’s smile stiffened, a quick flash of something territorial crossing her face before she looked away.

Ruth moved on before it turned awkward, humming a tune under her breath that I couldn’t place, something old and crooked, like a lullaby remembered halfway.

From there, Mae led us along a fence line toward the barn. A man about my age stood at a sagging gate, coaxing a hinge back into shape with a handful of nails and a hammer. A wheat stem parked at the corner of his mouth, and an easy grin on his face.

“Jonah,” Mae said. “If it’s broken, he’ll fix it. If it’s not broken, he’ll fix it anyway.”

Jonah stuck out a hand to Nick first, then me. His palm was rough but warm. “Ah, a city boy,” he added, friendly. “We’ve got a rehab program for soft hands.”

Nick laughed. “I think he prefers to supervise.”

“Supervisors get blisters too,” Jonah said. “Ruth sees to it.”

From the barn loft, a skinny young man whistled and waved before vanishing again.

“That’ll be Silas,” Jonah said, amused. “Don’t feed him after dark.”

“Silas,” I repeated.

“You’ll know him when you know him,” Jonah said.

Mae and Abel led us on toward the animal pens. Chickens scratched in the dirt near a small shed. A girl sat among them, legs crossed, braiding flowers into her hair. For a moment I thought she was much younger than she was supposed to be, thirteen, maybe fourteen at most. Barefoot, dress hem torn.

When she noticed us, she scrambled up and dusted off her knees. “You’re new,” she said.

Elenor smiled. “We are.”

The girl’s eyes darted to Elenor’s hand, to the ring there. “Pretty,” she whispered, then paused, thoughtful. “Do you like lemon or blackberry better?”

“For what?” Elenor asked, laughing.

“Just better.”

“Blackberry.”

The girl nodded like she’d been given an answer to a riddle, and hurried off, bare heels flashing in the dust.

Abel watched her go, something like pride softening his features. “And that’s Clara,” he said. “That girl collects sunbeams like they’re chores.”

We passed the tank Abel had mentioned, black-ribbed, cool in the shadow of the house. A tin ladle hung from a nail beneath the spigot. Beside it, a hand-lettered sign: GUEST WATER.

Past the tank, the land rolled down toward a line of trees that gathered thick and dark at the edge of a field. From somewhere inside them, you could hear water, not loud, not obvious, just the steady hush of it, like someone whispering in the next room.

Elenor cocked her head. “Do you hear that?”

“Wind in the leaves,” Abel said easily, though there wasn’t any wind. “Best to keep out of those woods. Curiosity’s a debt that doesn’t stop collecting once you owe it.”

Mae laid a hand on his arm, her voice soft but certain. “He’s right. Plenty of guests have come back from those woods with twisted ankles and bloodied shins. The ground turns mean out there, best to keep to the flat land where it’s kind.”

“Aye.” Abel agreed absently.

I smiled like I believed them, but I could tell the warning wasn’t about the terrain.

We looped back toward the house before the light could decide which way to fall. Just to the right of the main house stood a small guest cabin, two narrow bedrooms split by a short hall, with a shared washroom tucked behind it under a sloped awning.

“This one’s for you two,” Mae said, pointing to the door on the left. “And the one down the hall is for your brother and Hailey.”

Elenor ran her fingers over an embroidered quilt. “It’s beautiful,” she said.

Mae nodded. “The hands that make things put love in them. That’s what lasts.”

Then she left us alone, her footsteps fading into the hall.

El wandered the small space, opening drawers, smiling at the little note on the bedside table: *Welcome, Alex & Elenor.*

“This is so cute,” El said. “It’s like staying at a museum you can touch.”

I stood at the window and watched Harlan cross the yard with a log slung over one shoulder. He carried it the way I’d carry a backpack: absent, unbothered. For a second, his eyes lifted and met mine through the glass. Not hostile. Not curious. Just a long, flat look with something old behind it. Then he went back to the work that was already finished in his mind.

“I’m gonna find a washroom,” El said, squeezing my shoulder as she passed.

“Oh, alright, I’ll wait out front.”

I stepped outside. The air had grown heavier, the gold of it deep enough to taste. Abel stood at the edge of the porch, lighting a lantern, the match burning close to his fingers before he bothered to shake it out.

“It’s quiet here,” I said, walking up beside him.

He watched the flame steady behind the glass. “Sometimes the things that change us are quieter than we imagine,” he said. “By the time you see them, they feel like they were always part of you.”

The lantern light flickered against his face, carving the lines deeper. From inside came Mae’s voice.

“Supper,” she called.

Abel hung the lantern on its hook and straightened. El, Nick, and Hailey stepped out from the guest cabin at the same time, drawn by the sound of a dinner bell.

Abel held the door open for all of us, that same patient calm still in his eyes.

“Come eat,” he said. “You’ll need your strength for the morning.”

\*\*\*

The dining room was long and low, wood-dark and humming with warmth. Lanterns lined the walls, their glass fogged from heat, their light folding everything in amber. The table dominated the room, one heavy plank of cedar that looked older than anyone sitting around it.

Bowls steamed between us. Mae moved quietly, ladling stew with the slow confidence of repetition. “Don’t be shy,” she said, smiling. “The food tastes better when it disappears.”

Abel sat at the head of the table, posture upright but easy, like he’d been carved that way. Harlan sat near the door, shoulders filling his corner, silent as he had been since we’d arrived. Ruth and Jonah faced each other like a pair long used to working side by side. Silas lounged two seats down, tipping his chair on one leg.

It was hard not to feel like we’d wandered into someone else’s rhythm—a pattern mid-beat.

The family didn’t speak much at first. Only the sound of spoons scraping bowls, of Mae refilling plates before anyone could ask.

Mae broke the silence with a smile. “You’ve met most of us already, haven’t you?”

Nick nodded, mouth full. “Think so.”

She gestured gently with her spoon. “Ruth runs the garden and keeps us all fed. Jonah fixes what time breaks. Silas… tries to help.”

That earned a faint laugh from the others.

Silas grinned. “You’re just jealous I work smarter, not harder.”

“Smarter?” Ruth said. “Is that what you call hiding in the loft?”

“Observation deck,” he said. “Better view.”

Jonah snorted. “Better excuse.”

Abel didn’t look up, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

Even Mae chuckled softly, shaking her head. “You see what I live with.”

Elenor smiled at that. “Feels like home already.”

“Hopefully not too much,” Mae said gently. “The world out there’s a hard habit to break.”

Nick gestured toward me with his fork. “We’re the reason you’ve got two city folks at your table. Figured they could use a break from concrete.”

Elenor smiled. “And smog. Don’t forget the smog.”

Hailey grinned. “And rent.”

I laughed softly. “Yeah, mostly rent. City’ll charge you for air if you let it.”

Mae tilted her head. “And yet you stayed.”

I thought about it. “Habit, I guess. You work so hard to afford a life, you forget to live it.”

Abel raised his glass slightly. “Quiet’s not free either,” he said. “You just pay for it differently.”

The fire popped. Nobody spoke for a moment.

Then Mae’s voice softened. “Where’s Granddad tonight?”

Abel didn’t look up from his plate. “In his room,” he said. “Said he needed to listen awhile.”

Jonah nodded, swallowing. “The ground’s been stirring again.”

Mae nodded like that made sense. It didn’t.

The door creaked open behind us.

A girl stepped in, barefoot, dress smudged with dirt. Her braid hung loose, and there were dark stains beneath her fingernails—not wet, but not old either.

Clara.

She kept her eyes down, slipping into her chair like she’d been there all along. Mae placed a bowl in front of her without a word.

Silas leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “You wash up with mud now, kid?”

Clara ignored him.

He grinned wider. “Guess that’s one way to blend in with the pigs.”

Jonah gave a quiet “Silas,” under his breath, but it did nothing.

Silas dipped his spoon, flicked a bit of stew at her sleeve. “Missed a spot.”

She looked up, expression calm but flat. “You done?”

“Just making conversation.”

“Try harder,” she said, voice low.

Silas laughed, a dry, empty sound. “Careful, sister. You’re starting to sound like Ruth.”

That was when Harlan stood.

The chair’s scrape cut through everything. He didn’t say a word, didn’t need to. His shadow stretched the length of the table.

Silas’ grin faltered. “Kidding,” he said softly. “Just kidding.”

Abel didn’t raise his voice. “Harlan.”

The big man’s head turned slightly.

“Sit.”

He did.

Then Abel looked at Silas, calm and final. “You don’t sharpen a knife on family.”

Silas nodded once, eyes low. “Yes, sir.”

The room exhaled.

Clara finally glanced at Harlan, the ghost of a smile curling at her mouth. “Calm down, big guy. I can handle him.”

A few small laughs slipped through the tension. Mae’s hand brushed Clara’s shoulder as she passed, steadying, grounding.

The meal carried on—slower now, but softer. Ruth asked Nick about his work, curious in a quiet, measured way. Mae asked Elenor about her ring, her smile genuine. Abel mostly listened, weighing silences.

The food was rich, the warmth steady. But every so often, I caught myself noticing the details: like how the family drank from old, earthen mugs instead of the clear glasses set for us, I couldn’t quite tell what they were drinking.

Abel’s hand rested near his cup, but his eyes kept drifting toward the window, as if something out there was listening too.

When Mae finally rose, she did so gently, her voice the soft close of a hymn. “You’ve all had a long day. Tomorrow starts early. The light comes quick here.”

Abel stood as well, his chair groaning. “Rest well,” he said. “Work or not, everyone contributes here.”

\*\*\*

Back in the guest bathroom, the air felt cooler. Hailey leaned against the sink, hair tied up, a half-drunk glass of wine in her hand.

“They’re nice,” she said, “but that was... different.”

Nick grinned, rolling up his sleeves as he washed his hands. “Different’s good. I didn’t see anyone glued to a phone.”

“Maybe because they took them all,” Hailey said. “Pretty sure that counts as kidnapping.”

Elenor sat on the edge of the counter, towel over her lap. “They just have their way of doing things. It’s kind of refreshing, actually.”

“Until they say grace over a fresh guest stew,” Hailey muttered.

Nick chuckled. “Hey, you’re the one who wanted to come. You’re just paranoid.”

“I’m aware,” she said, taking another sip. “Doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”

I turned on the tap. It gurgled, coughed, then fell silent. Elenor pointed to the black drum in the corner. “Guest water,” she said.

Hailey crossed her arms. “It’s weird we can’t even use the tap. What happens if you forget?”

Nick shrugged. “Guess you don’t forget.”

Elenor smiled faintly. “You guys think too much. It’s just plumbing.”

“Maybe,” Hailey said, glancing toward the window. “Or maybe it’s something else.”

Nick stepped behind her, pressing a kiss to her temple. “It’s just old pipes, babe. We’re fine.”

She relaxed slightly, smiling despite herself. “Fine. But if I start growing gills, I’m blaming you.”

Elenor laughed softly. “God, you’re dramatic.”

“Occupational hazard,” Hailey said. “I like to keep the mood lively.”

The light flickered once and steadied.

Nick stretched, yawning. “Alright, campers. Big day tomorrow.”

Elenor stood, brushing her hair over one shoulder. “You coming?”

“In a sec,” I said, glancing at the window one last time. The farmhouse glowed faintly through the trees, lanterns still burning inside.

Elenor touched my arm. “Come on.”

I followed her, closing the door softly behind us.

The night felt thick around us, the air cool and wet. Above, the stars burned sharp and endless—millions of diamonds I’d forgotten the city had stolen from me.

\*\*\*

The guest cabin held the day’s warmth like a kept secret.

The lantern on the dresser hissed low, its flame cupped in glass, throwing a soft amber sway across the walls. Outside, the crickets had gone still. The quiet wasn’t empty, just dense, like a blanket pulled over the night.

Elenor sat cross-legged on the bed, brushing her hair. I watched her reflection in the small mirror: the way her eyes didn’t quite look at herself but at the space around her, as if the room were a pond and she was checking what moved beneath the surface.

“You know,” she said softly, “for a place this quiet, it doesn’t feel empty.”

I was half-lying on the quilt, propped on one elbow. “No. It doesn’t.”

She set the brush down and turned, that small smile widening just enough to reach me. She looked like home, the kind that makes you forget what time is doing to you.

When she crawled into bed, the quilt lifted with a papery whisper. Her palm found my chest, tracing slow, absent shapes. Her knee brushed mine; the mattress sighed, old but steady.

“You think they’re asleep already?” she whispered.

I glanced toward the door. “Feels like the whole farm is.”

She smiled. “Then I guess it’s just us.”

She kissed me, soft at first, then deeper, the kind of kiss that pulls the world in close. My hand slipped to the back of her neck, her pulse warm beneath my thumb. The lantern light wavered and set our shadows breathing on the walls.

We moved the way you do when you’re trying not to wake a house: slow, familiar, reverent. For a while, the world was only breath and skin and the heat of being known.

She laughed softly into my neck. “You packed the condoms, right?”

“Drawer,” I murmured.

Her hand reached past me, the drawer giving a small wooden sigh. A rustle, then stillness.

“They’re not here.”

I blinked. “What?”

“The condoms. You sure you packed them?”

I leaned over and looked into the drawer. No box. No wrappers.

“I swear I put them right there. Maybe Nick stole 'em?” I said. “We’ll check in the morning.”

“Yeah,” she said quietly. “Morning.”

She came back to me, though the rhythm was different now, something cautious beneath the warmth.

Then I felt it: the smallest thread of air against my ankle, cool, damp, shaped like a breath slipping through the crack beneath the door.

I froze.

Elenor did too. Our breathing fell out of sync.

“What?” she whispered.

The quiet had shifted tones, same silence, different weight.

A board bent. Not the lazy sigh of old wood, but a careful test of pressure. Then a pause. And in that pause came a breath: long, uneven, dragged through a throat that didn’t quite know how to be quiet. A wet, rasping inhale.

Elenor’s hand tightened on my arm. “Alex.”

The door wasn’t shut all the way. A thin seam of dark where wood should’ve met wood. I remembered closing it, remembered the click. The gap was small, but wide enough to imagine an eye behind it.

“We closed that,” I said, barely above air.

The breathing came again, slow and steady, a soft gurgle like a man half drowning.

“Nick?” El tried.

Silence answered. Then another soft exhale, hot and damp, threading through the crack.

I slipped from the bed. The floor met my feet like ice. The lamp’s glow reached only halfway across the room, beyond that, everything was a suggestion.

“I’ll check,” I whispered.

“Alex, don’t—”

But I was already opening the door.

Nothing.

The hall pressed in close, walls breathing with the heat of the day. The lamp at the far end had burned down to an amber pulse. My heart made too much sound.

I stepped toward Nick and Hailey’s door, the boards groaning softly beneath my weight. A line of light glowed under their door, steady, human. I knocked lightly.

“Nick.”

A muffled voice came from the other side. “Jesus, man. You good?”

“Did you hear anything? Breathing? Steps?”

There was a pause. Sheets rustling. Hailey’s tired voice somewhere in the mix. Nick laughed, low and hoarse. “Pretty sure that was you, dude. You two aren’t exactly subtle.”

“Not that,” I said. “Someone was outside our door.”

His tone changed. “You serious?”

“Yeah.”

He hesitated, then said, “Probably the wind. This place creaks like hell.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Probably.”

But the air didn’t move. Not even a whisper.

When I turned back, my throat went dry.

The front door of the guest cabin was standing wide open.

Beyond it, the night was a flat sheet of black. The curtain beside the frame swayed once, then stopped dead.

For a moment, I couldn’t move. Something had either just left—or entered.

“Nick,” I called softly, but their door stayed shut.

Wearing nothing but my boxers, I took a step toward the open doorway. The air that started to pour in from outside was cold, metallic, carrying the smell of wet leaves and soil. The yard stretched beyond: a wash of colorless shapes, the fence like a spine against the horizon.

And then it hit me like a stone to the gut: *Elenor*.

I ran for our room, hoping, praying, that something hadn’t reached her before I could.

The boards wailed under me. The lamp flickered once, as if flinching from the noise. I reached our door, my hand slapping the wood as I went to push it open, but my palm landed on something warm.

Not warm like sun-touched wood. Warm like skin. Damp. The kind of warmth that lingers after a mouth.

I yanked my hand back. Someone had been standing there. Breathing against the door.

I shoved it open.

Elenor sat up in bed, eyes wide. “Jesus—Alex?”

I scanned the room. Empty. Just the lantern glow, the quilts, the open drawer.

“Door was open,” I said. My voice didn’t sound like mine.

“What?”

“The front door. Wide open.”

She stared at me. The silence between us felt like static.

I shut our door hard and twisted the latch until it caught. Then dragged the chair from the corner and jammed it under the knob.

“If that door opens again, I’m going to lose my shit.”

Elenor’s eyes followed me as I climbed back into bed. “You sure it wasn’t the wind?”

“No,” I said. “Not the wind.”

We didn’t touch. The air between us felt thick—watched.

As I sat awake and watched the door fade into shadow, I swore I could still hear breathing softly through the wood, like the cabin itself had learned the rhythm of our sleep, and was keeping time.",2,1763939338.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1p50xnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1p50xnd/three_years_of_huel_thoughts_ama/,"Three Years of Huel: Thoughts, AMA","I know a lot of Huel-curious people wonder what it's like to consume Huel long-term, so here's my experience.

I started drinking Huel three years ago. My consumption of Huel has varied a lot in that time. I'll have weeks where half my intake is Huel, and weeks where I only have a few. On average, I'd say I have Huel for breakfast 4-5x/week and Huel for lunch 2-3x/week. 

My SO lived on Huel almost exclusively for nearly six months when he was dealing with some health stuff and Huel was the only thing he could tolerate. He occasionally ate small portions of normal meals (especially towards the end when he started claiming he'd rather drive off a bridge than eat another goddamn Hot and Savory), but ~80% of his calorie intake was Huel products. The health issues have since resolved, and he drinks slightly more Huel than I do.

With those bona fides out of the way, here's a collection of random thoughts:

* I switched to Huel Black about a year in. I prefer it. 

* I switched to RTD about two years in. I *strongly* prefer it. I know it's more expensive and it's wasteful and blah blah blah but the worst part of the Huel powders has always been the texture and the RTDs have a better texture.

* Huel doesn't always satisfy my hunger if I don't have something solid with it. Sometimes I have to add some fruit, nuts, toast, or crackers.

* Huel farts do go away after a while. Either that or I've totally forgotten what normal farts feel/smell like. That's also possible.

*  The best part of Huel is being able to throw one in my bag in case my day gets busy. I never skip meals anymore. I might not have time to cook + eat, but I can grab a Huel and keep going.

* The second-best part of Huel is that it's pretty much a perfect breakfast for me. I prefer liquid breakfasts, always have. I'm not usually very hungry in the morning, but if I don't eat, I'll crash hard about 10am. As a teen, I liked Carnation Instant Breakfast. In college, I liked smoothies. Now I prefer Huel.

* When I used the powder, I often got a lot of weird looks and questions from people. After switching to the RTD, nobody seems to notice or care that I'm having a liquid meal. I don't know if it's because meal replacement shakes have gotten more popular over the last few years or if it's just because it's less noticeable overall. Huel powder requires an awful lot of shaking.

* It has gotten more expensive. So has everything else.

* I did get a bad RTD shake once. One out of hundreds, so QC is pretty solid. But man, that was bad. It was chunky and tasted like straight vomit. I opened it up, took a big chug, and immediately spat it directly onto the floor. My body hit the EJECT button before I had even consciously registered the taste/texture. I'll never be able to drink the Iced Coffee flavor again.

* Speaking of flavors, Chocolate and Strawberry Banana Black RTD are still the winners. Strawberry Banana is slightly better, but I can get tired of it. I never seem to get tired of the Chocolate.

* I mostly drink my Huels at room temperature. They are better cold, but I need that fridge space for actual food. And beer. 

* Huel is not a weight-loss shake, but it's kind of challenging to *gain* weight if you're getting most of your calories from Huel. I'd love to say this is because of how perfectly nutritious it is but honestly it's because Huel doesn't taste good enough to ""overeat"" it.

* I *loathe* the Hot and Savories. My SO liked them, at least until he had to eat them exclusively for months. I can't stomach them; I don't even like the way they smell. 

* I've had the bars, borrowed off a friend who also has Huel for most meals. It's a protein bar. The texture reminds me a lot of Pure Protein bars, and I don't like those much. But if you like those, you'll love these. 

* It is most certainly food. It is energy without enjoyment. And that's not a bad thing. Not every meal to be a sensory delight. Sometimes I just need to fill up the tank without having to think about it too hard. Huel is perfect for those moments.

* It is a smidge dystopian if you think about it too hard. Drinking a scientifically-designed nutrition shake that meets all of my basic needs but does not provide the sensory or social delights of mealtime because I'm too busy to enjoy the basic human act of cooking a meal and sharing it with loved ones. Kinda feels like something out of a Black Mirror episode. But that's not Huel's fault. 

* Do not spill Huel in your car. Do *not* spill Huel in your car. You will NEVER get that smell out.


Anyway, feel free to ask me anything about Huel or living on a largely-Huel diet for many years.",13,1763939332.0,Huel,0,0.94,False

Lots of people are curious about whether these kits can really make a difference without damaging their teeth.

The short answer? Yes, but there are some important things you need to know first.

## What Makes Teeth Whitening Kits Different

Most at-home whitening kits use peroxide-based gels that break down stains on your tooth enamel. Unlike whitening toothpaste that only removes surface stains, these kits can actually lighten the color of your teeth by several shades.

The difference between drugstore products and quality kits is huge. Better options usually include LED lights that activate the whitening gel, custom trays that fit your teeth properly, and the right concentration of whitening agents.

## Can You Really Use It Every Day?

Here's where it gets tricky. ""Everyday use"" doesn't mean the same thing for all whitening products.

Professional-grade whitening kits typically recommend using them for 10-30 minutes per session, anywhere from daily to a few times per week depending on the formula strength. Once you reach your desired shade, you usually only need maintenance sessions every few weeks.

Using whitening products too frequently can lead to tooth sensitivity and irritated gums. Your teeth need recovery time between treatments.

## What Results Can You Expect

Most people see noticeable whitening within 3-7 days of consistent use. The best results usually appear after 2-3 weeks of following the recommended schedule.

Your results depend on what's causing the discoloration. Coffee stains, tea, wine, and smoking-related yellowing respond really well to peroxide-based treatments. If your teeth are gray-toned or discolored from medication, whitening might be less effective.

## Finding the Right Kit

When shopping for a teeth whitening kit, you want to look for products with good reviews, clear instructions, and ingredients that dental professionals recognize as safe. LED acceleration technology can speed up results, and desensitizing gel helps if you have sensitive teeth.

If you're ready to give it a shot, [check out quality whitening kits here](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) where you can compare different options and read verified customer reviews.

## The Bottom Line

A good whitening kit is worth it if you're realistic about your expectations and follow the instructions carefully. It's not really an ""everyday forever"" thing – it's more like a treatment cycle followed by occasional touch-ups.

The convenience of whitening at home while watching TV or doing chores beats sitting in a dentist's chair for an hour. Plus, you'll spend way less money than professional treatments that can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

Just remember to give your teeth breaks between treatment cycles, use fluoride toothpaste to strengthen enamel, and stop if you experience pain or extreme sensitivity.
