I’m a Thrissurkaran myself and I guess I shouldn’t be asking this here and should be knowing my stuff but here I go. I’m currently settled in Chennai and I’m only occasionally visiting home back in tcr, hence the ask.

So the thing is I’ve got around 3 members from my team (including my manager) who’s coming to Thrissur for Christmas (25th) this year. I just need everyone’s suggestions on making a good itinerary that covers some of the top places to visit in Thrissur.

Of course I know I’ll be taking them to SOME of the below places based on time availability:

Places of Worship:
Vadakkunnathan
Puthanpally (Evening of Christmas)
Lourdepally (maybe)
Paramekkavu
Thiruvambady (maybe)

Shopping: Sobha mall, Nesto

Restaurants:
Bharath
Sapphire
Hotel Round
Indian coffee house
Akshaya (lemme know which branch(s) are most preferred - Punkunnam maybe?)

I’m definitely missing out on a LOT more places in this list, so go ham peeps. Anything that you think would make the list better - any recommendations/suggestions, I’m open to it.

Excerpt:

He found Crowley at the kitchen table, fully dressed down to the sunglasses that covered his eyes despite the darkness, a full cup of coffee clutched in one hand.

“Crowley?” Aziraphale asked again, lingering in the doorway. His heart beat unsteadily in his chest as Crowley slowly turned around but didn’t quite look at him. “Is everything alright?”

“I had a dream,” Crowley said, and there was something horrifically wrong in his tone.

Earlier, I used to do fashion illustrations, and during the learning process, I could take guidance from my sister, who is a graphic designer, so I never faced any difficulty.
Currently, I’m studying Data Science, specifically Economics with Data Science. However, I didn’t want to distance myself from the field of illustrations and design, which is why I decided to learn UI/UX. This is because UI/UX and fashion illustrations are part of the same niche.
But there’s an issue .... I need proper guidance. YouTube is available for learning, but having proper guidance makes a huge difference. So far, I have designed a coffee shop website and a watch website. Honestly, I’m not even sure if what I’m doing is right or wrong. I haven’t received any reviews or judgments on my work. I need critical opinions. I also don’t know much about the advanced features of Figma, and there’s so much to explore. I want to know where I can post my work to receive honest feedback so I can improve myself. I want to start freelancing in UI/UX and need guidance on how to create a profile, stand out, and learn faster. I know I can learn and grasp concepts quickly, but I just need the right guidance.

This is how I would pitch to write the opening scene for resurrection if I was in the writers room:

We begin the scene with a wide angle shot of an apartment we as the viewer are unfamiliar with.

We see from behind a slim woman sitting on the sofa eating potato chips and watching TV. 

We start to pan in slowly closer towards the TV but we do not see the woman’s face. We see a messy apartment with letters strewn across the dining table and wrappers of candy bars and beer cans. As the camera gets right behind the sofa we start to pan sideways.

We can still see the TV but we start to see more of the woman from the side. We see a messy coffee table in between the sofa and the TV. 

A breaking news alert appears on the TV announcing that the Miami police have apprehended a suspect they believe to be the infamous Bay Harbour Butcher and an image of Dexter appears.

We can still only see up to the woman’s shoulder at this point but as this news alert pops up we see her throw down the bag of chips she was eating and shout “motherfucker” - we then finally pan up and see the face of Debra Morgan and we instantly cut to the intro.

We don’t know at this point if it’s real or a figment of Dexters imagination as he sits in prison, but the viewer is hooked and after the intro we move to the Miami metro police department.

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Hello all, I need some advice. Recently, I posted on Facebook about wanting to meet new people and share hobbies since I’ve been in a new country for a year now. A woman reached out to me and invited me for a walk at her usual spot.

We had a great conversation, discussing relationships, business, politics, and personal topics. She even opened up about her past relationships, including being cheated on (something I asked about in the flow of the conversation).

After the walk, she invited me to her place for coffee/tea, and we had coffee there as well.

Now, here’s where I’m confused: I’m interested in her romantically because I admire her thoughts, ideas, and how she views life. I told her about my interest over WhatsApp, but I’m unsure if she sees me as just a friend or if she’s also interested romantically.

What do you think? Could her actions (inviting me for a walk, having coffee at her place, and sharing personal stories) indicate romantic interest, or is this just her being friendly? How should I proceed without making things awkward?

The holidays are a time for magic, joy, and a little bit of mischief. If you live in Miami, or are planning to visit this tropical paradise, there's a fun opportunity to infuse the spirit of the holidays with a touch of whimsical mischief by bringing the Grinch to life in a distinctly Miami way! Whether you're a fan of Dr. Seuss' classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" or simply looking to add some holiday flair to your celebrations, Miami is the perfect place to create a memorable Grinch-inspired experience.

In this guide, we'll explore how you can integrate the Grinch into your Miami holiday festivities in ways that are uniquely suited to the city’s vibrant culture. From festive decorations to themed events and even Grinch-inspired parties, there are endless ways to spread cheer and a little bit of playful Grinchiness throughout Miami this season.

# 1. Grinch-Inspired Holiday Decorations Around Miami

Miami is known for its lush, tropical beauty and its festive, larger-than-life celebrations. This year, why not add a Grinchy twist to your holiday décor? Whether you’re decorating your home, setting up a holiday event, or simply walking through the streets, there are plenty of ways to showcase a Grinch-themed atmosphere.

**Transform Your Home into Whoville**

Start with your own space—transforming your home into a Whoville wonderland is the perfect way to embrace the Grinch in Miami. Imagine vibrant red and green decorations paired with tropical palm trees strung with twinkling lights. You can even create a Grinch-inspired tree by using unconventional, playful ornaments like oversized candy canes, faux snowflakes, and Grinch-themed baubles.

**Palm Trees with a Grinchy Touch**

You can’t forget the palm trees! Miami’s beaches are known for their towering palms, so why not decorate them like Whoville Christmas trees? Wrap the trunks with green and red tinsel, drape tropical flowers or poinsettias throughout the leaves, and top them off with fun Grinch-themed ornaments. To keep the fun going, you can even add Grinch figurines or signs that say “Merry Grinchmas!” along your front lawn.

**Grinch-Themed Lights and Inflatable Décor**

Miami’s warm weather means that outdoor Christmas lights can shine bright without the worry of freezing temperatures. Use lights to bring the Grinch’s mischievous grin to life by setting up festive scenes. You can place inflatable Grinch decorations in your yard, or opt for lighting that outlines the shape of the Grinch’s smile or sleigh.

# 2. Hosting a Grinch Party in Miami

What better way to celebrate the holiday season than with a Grinch-themed party? Miami’s lively party scene is the ideal backdrop for creating an unforgettable Grinchmas bash.

**Grinch-Inspired Cocktails and Drinks**

Every great party begins with delicious food and drinks. You can create a Grinch-inspired cocktail bar featuring bright green drinks that reflect the Grinch’s signature color. For adults, think lime margaritas or a festive Grinch Punch made with lemon-lime soda, green sherbet, and a splash of vodka. For the kids, a refreshing green apple punch or limeade can keep things fun and festive.

**Grinch-Themed Party Games and Activities**

Get creative with your Grinch-themed party games! Set up a “Pin the Heart on the Grinch” game where guests blindfold themselves and try to attach a red felt heart to a large poster of the Grinch. Alternatively, a holiday scavenger hunt can be themed around finding Grinch-related objects, like a Who’s Who of Miami characters or Grinch memorabilia. You could also challenge guests to dress like the Grinch or his loyal dog Max, with a prize for the best costume.

**Miami’s Party Vibe: Dance the Night Away**

Miami is known for its party scene, so why not host a Grinch-themed dance-off? A holiday dance competition with songs like “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch” or more contemporary hits with a Grinch-inspired twist could be a fun way to bring the energy to your gathering. Miami's tropical vibe means you can even bring out a summer dance feel, adding a laid-back vibe to your Grinch party.

**Grinch-Themed Art Exhibits**

Miami is a cultural hub, and there’s no better way to celebrate the Grinch than with art! Many local galleries and pop-up art shows host holiday-themed exhibits.

Dressing up as the Grinch is one of the most entertaining ways to embody his mischievous spirit. Miami’s vibrant and trendy fashion scene allows you to put a tropical spin on the Grinch’s classic look.

**Classic Grinch Costume with a Miami Twist**

Start with a traditional Grinch costume—green fur, Santa hat, and all. Then add a Miami flair! Think sunglasses, a floral-patterned Santa coat, or even flip-flops instead of boots. The warm weather makes it easy to adapt the classic look while staying comfortable and festive.

**DIY Grinch-Inspired Attire**

For a more casual approach, DIY Grinch-inspired fashion can be a fun project for families. Use a green shirt, pair it with red shorts, and accessorize with Grinchy face paint or a Santa hat. For a chic Miami twist, go for tropical patterns in green and red or create custom Grinch t-shirts using stencils and fabric paint.

**Kids and Pets in Grinchy Outfits**

Don’t forget about the little ones and furry friends! Dress your kids as mini Grinches or adorable Whos from Whoville. For pets, consider a dog-friendly Max costume with reindeer antlers or a green Grinch-inspired outfit. Miami’s outdoor pet-friendly events are perfect for showcasing their festive looks.

# 7. Hosting a Grinchy Feast: Miami-Style Holiday Cuisine

Food plays a big role in any holiday celebration, and a Grinch-inspired feast in Miami can combine festive cheer with the city’s vibrant culinary culture.

**Green-Themed Foods and Drinks**

Prepare dishes that reflect the Grinch’s iconic green hue. Think guacamole platters, spinach dip, and green salads with tropical fruits like mango and pineapple. For dessert, whip up green cupcakes, matcha-flavored cookies, or a Grinch-shaped cake.

**Tropical Holiday Menu with a Grinchy Flair**

Since Miami boasts fresh seafood and tropical ingredients, create a holiday menu inspired by the Grinch that also reflects the city’s flavors. Consider dishes like lime-marinated ceviche, grilled mahi-mahi, or coconut shrimp served with a festive green sauce. To top it off, serve piña coladas or mojitos in Grinchy green cups.

**Creative Food Presentations**

Have fun with the presentation! Serve appetizers on platters shaped like the Grinch’s grin or use Grinch-themed serving dishes. A fun idea is to create a “Roast Beast” centerpiece, a playful nod to the Grinch’s feast, using a roast or plant-based alternative.

# 8. Grinchy Acts of Kindness to Spread Holiday Cheer

While the Grinch is known for his mischief, the story’s message is about the power of kindness and community. Incorporate this heartwarming lesson into your Miami holiday season.

Gather your loved ones for a day of volunteering. Whether it’s serving meals at a local shelter or participating in a beach cleanup, the shared experience of giving back brings the true meaning of the holidays to life. Why not dress in Grinchy attire while you do it to add some holiday cheer?

# 9. Creating Grinchy Traditions Unique to Miami

The holidays are all about traditions, and incorporating the Grinch into your Miami celebrations can lead to fun new customs.

# 10. Grinchy Fun for Kids in Miami

Children are naturally drawn to the playful and mischievous nature of the Grinch, making him a perfect holiday character to inspire fun and learning.

**Grinch Crafts and DIY Projects**

Get crafty with the kids by creating Grinch masks, ornaments, or decorations. Use materials like construction paper, pom-poms, and glitter to make the crafts colorful and festive. Miami’s tropical plants can also be used creatively, such as painting coconuts green to resemble the Grinch.

**Grinch Storytime and Puppet Shows**

Organize a holiday storytime featuring Dr. Seuss’ “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” For an interactive experience, host a puppet show where the kids can act out scenes from the story, adding their own creative twists.

**Grinch Treasure Hunts**

Plan a Grinch-themed treasure hunt in your yard or a local Miami park. Hide “stolen” holiday items, like ornaments or presents, and have the kids work together to find them and “save Christmas.”

1h7xwoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1h7xwoi/passed_at_150_second_attempt/,Passed at 150 (Second Attempt),"**History:**

I got exposed to CISSP 3 years ago while associating with people in the community in real life. I remembered my very first post back then:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/v4c9c9/for\_those\_who\_passed\_cissp\_do\_you\_have\_a\_raise\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/v4c9c9/for_those_who_passed_cissp_do_you_have_a_raise_in/)

When on to pursue my path as a pentester and achieved the necessary certification and experience before coming back about a year ago, and u/RealLou_JustLou invited me into discord for CISSP prep.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/192ippd/i\_am\_back\_here\_to\_meet\_fellow\_friends\_who\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/192ippd/i_am_back_here_to_meet_fellow_friends_who_are/)

Didnt't really dive deep into it until August this year. I bought piece of mind after I felt ready, thinking that first attempt was to identify and strategize my gaps in knowledge for the domains if I ever failed.

**What went down on first attempt:** Failed at 150 (First Attempt)

**Materials - Pete Zerger's Cram Video, OSG book, OSG test banks**

I thought I could take on the exam with just Pete Zerger's cram video on CISSP, Latest OSG book as well as test banks. I failed narrowly at 150. I was anxious and skipped my sleep the night before the exam, I was already a wreck by question 60-80, struggling all the way through 150. I reflected the loss and identified what went wrong and back to the cram for the second attempt.

**What went down on second attempt:**

**Materials - Pete Zerger's Cram Video, OSG book, OSG test banks, Study partner from reddit, DestCert resources and mindmap, Learnzapp, QuantumExams**

Scheduled 1 month after the fail. I began to throw everything I have into the preparation. Wake, work, eat, study, sleep. Nothing else. I tried to identify common pitfalls of topics where I felt I could get confused and spent extra time to clear them up.  Wrote up the mindmap (DestCert) to identify the relations and to pinned it up on my wall everyday I wake up to improve memory retention. I also did various test simulations, and identify the tricky questions and the debatable multiple choices. GET IT SORTED, and know why some answers aren't the answers even though they felt like it. Wrote mental notes on pitfall topics before the exam, then browse through it every so often. Give it a tick when gap is sorted and when I'm sure I can identify the possible questions along with the most suitable answer. Ample rest, eating mint sweets before the exam and worked through the exam. Passed at 150 with 20 minutes remaining.

Thanks again u/RealLou_JustLou for getting me into the channel where I could find useful resources. Thanks to my study partner too as well. Valuable friend, from reddit. We are planning to meet up soon for quick coffee. This marks the end of my CISSP journey, moving onto another adventure !

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1733477417.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I don't want to leave the coffee, once made, in the glass jug. 

I would like some suggestions for something to 'hold' our (filter) coffee in to keep it warm. Not a travel mug, but just something to put 1l of coffee in so we can then afterwards pour it into our cups. Usually for like 1 to 2 hours.

Being in your mid to late 20s you see everyone in your group getting married, in stable relationships and planning a future and a family with the love of their life! And looking at my family’s struggle to look for a groom through arranged marriage setup for my sister and my friends motivating me to date again after my last relationship, I installed Bumble and Hinge and I stayed for 2 months on these apps. My observations were:

1. Even men in their late 20s- early 30s aren’t looking for anything serious but just Netflix and Chill or just wanting to come over at your place, I mean dude… at least ask a girl out on a date before you ask her to your bed? 

2. People have very misleading profiles… they would state they want a long term relationship or a life partner but end up asking for a hookup.

3. Most people don’t know how to keep a conversation going. Conversations are getting reduced to a good morning and how are you doing text even during the initial stages. There’s no willingness to know the other person. Even when I am initiating conversations, the replies are too dry. 

4. People don’t want to go out for dates because it is apparently expensive. Mind you, I have always offered to split and never been one of those people who wants to go for expensive places. A simple coffee at any cafe is great but tapri ki chai for a first date is too less of an effort for anyone and suggesting that as a first date is really bad. 

5. What is this prejudice about Bengali women and Kaala jaadu?! You are in the goddamn 21st century and if that’s what you’re worried about don’t match! It’s that simple! I legit deleted the app after a guy said “Mummy ne Bengali ladkiyon se dur rehne bola hai kyuki woh kaala jaadu karti hai” and the same guy texted just 2 texts before that, that he would like to cook for me and cuddle with me?!

These apps are really taxing and drains out whatever hope I had for searching for “the one”. ",15,1733476164.0,Indiangirlsontinder,26,0.94,False

# The collective has over 100 multidisciplinary artists all based in Belfast, with many featuring in the 60+ market stalls

**The Vault Artist Studio's Christmas Market at Carlisle Memorial Church in North Belfast in 2023** (Image: Chad Alexander)

One of Belfast's biggest independent Christmas markets will return to a North Belfast site this month.

Vault Artist Studio’s Christmas market returns on December 7-8 to [Carlisle Memorial Church](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/north-belfast), following a continuing partnership with Belfast Buildings Trust (BBT) after the market's first year at the site last year.

The popular market’s future had been uncertain as the group [recently relocated to two new premises](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/belfast-arts-collective-looking-future-27893034), in Victoria Street and the old Shankill Mission Building, neither of which have the capacity to host the two-day event that has grown significantly over recent years.

With yet another move in the offing, as a result of the lack of permanent artist studios spaces in Belfast, the team said they are delighted to continue their partnership with Belfast Buildings Trust to host the market in Carlisle Memorial Church.

Over the course of the weekend, the [festive market](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/christmas), free and open to all, will feature 60+ stalls per day of Belfast’s best independent artists selling everything from jewellery; original paintings, fine art prints and photographs; ceramics and porcelain; wooden bowls and stoneware; books and zines; t-shirts, clothes and totes; fashion accessories; wax melts, diffusers and candles; textiles; vintage items and antiques; and much more.

Vault Chairperson, Linda McBurney said: ""We’re delighted to continue our partnership with Belfast Buildings Trust, an organisation with whom we share many aims, and to work in this part of the city again especially at a time when yet another studio move hangs over our organisation. Our vibrant Christmas Market gives us a huge boost as well as to all of the independent makers who join us over the course of the weekend.""

It is a chance to pick up a gift for a loved one (or to treat yourself) that you won’t find elsewhere – and to ease yourself into the Christmas period in a spectacular setting.

Vault’s performing arts line-up of roving performers, in-house DJ, and much-loved Christmas Elves, will be on hand to keep you entertained and informed. The hugely-popular raffle, already running, will continue on both days.

Meanwhile several [food stalls](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/food-and-drink) and trucks will provide Filipino spring rolls, vegan snacks, and poutine.

I sweep the floor, I dust the blinds,
I lock my dreams where no one finds.

My painted smile betrays no frown.

He strides in strong, his shoes mud-stained,
The silence whispers: I’m well-trained.
Dinner’s served at six, not late,
I choke it down with silent hate.

The mirror sees what I can’t say,
A shadowed ghost in pearls and gray.
Her lips are red, her hair a curl,
She’s not a wife, she’s not a girl.

I press the iron, the heat’s alive,
It hums a song of my denied.
I wonder now, if pressed to skin,
Would it scorch out this cage I’m in?

The neighbors smile, they never know,
Their lawns are green, their roses grow.
But late at night, when the clocks stand still,
I hear the wind; it knows my will.

Their edges glint inside my dream.

A few years back I signed up at a local games club near my workplace, close enough that I could swing by there after a shift or two throughout the week. They had booths for groups and different areas for different things and it was all really well managed.

I'd played a few games there with various people and had good experiences when I saw someone on the club Facebook page recruiting for a game of Eclipse Phase 2. For those who aren't familiar, its a sci-fi setting: AI destroyed most of humanity in the solar system before disappearing and leaving all sorts of nasty nanoswarms, basalisk hacks and horrible bio-machine hybrids laying about. Humanity is recovering, you can swap bodies by downloading your consciousness from place to place, you can be an uplifted octopus, all that good stuff. I signed up immediately.

Session 0 came about and I met the DM and three other players. I'd prepared a wise-cracking snake-mech merc, one guy was inhibiting a swarm of micro-bots, one was a digized consciousness and the last was... well, as he proudly informed all of us, he was Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.

Problem is, it's hard to replicate Rick Sanchez at Level 1. That and the character is notoriously antisocial and a danger to friend and for alike. Fortunately the DM shut down his efforts to weedle for increased stats so he could have a mastery over all the skills Rick would have, and we managed to work around his characters' affectations for the first two sessions. He played edgy and arrogant and almost started a fight or three, but we handled it.

But while we were busy handling it, I began to realise there were issues with the DM too.

Every enemy hacker had a skill of 120/100. We could never counteract or trace them because they possessed a mastery outside of human comprehension. They were using this mastery to make the station's coffee dispensers swear at people.


We emailed ourselves from our remote backwater asteroid to Luna, (its faster than flying there, okay?) but they conviently had exact replicas of our modded up bodies and gear ready to go. My character had a penchant for switching between various forms, hence his heavily customized mechanical snake body. Consider my surprise when strangers I'd  never met before had an identical frame laying about for whoever happened to come along next.

Every single fight was against one opponent. I'd make efforts to cover our rear, check the flanks, position myself to provide covering fire. I wanted to be ambushed, but it never happened.
In the final session, we got shot at by the different guns. I was thrilled. I thought there'd be a minimum of two opponents. I was wrong. 
It was one robot with three arms.

Session three was the breaking point. We'd blown up a body-horror monster factory and its mad scientist crew the session before and were prepping for the trip to Luna, but Rick Sanchez was nowhere to be found. The player smirked and said we'd have to go find him, and the DM wouldn't let us progress until we'd done so, so we pinged his location (his cabin) and went to collect him. Upon opening the door, the player grinned.

""You find me curled up on my cot, horrifically drunk and crying inconsolably. My father was one of the scientists we vented! Still crying, I roll over to face you. In my arms, you can see a half-empty bottle of spirits and a block of C4.""

All three of us turned to the DM and said we weren't going anywhere with this guy. In and out of character, we listed the myriad reasons why a depressed drunkard with C4 was not a good guy to hang around with on a space station. We wanted to haul him to the brig immediately. The player protested. ""Its what he would do! He's upset!"" The DM shrugged, and said it wouldn't be fair to the player to leave Rick behind.So we rolled out eyes, told him he needed to work with us rather than against us and went along with it for the rest of the session. Then we all independently quit before the next session.",21,1733474950.0,rpghorrorstories,1,0.82,False

I have been battling with insomnia for many years now. It started somewhere in my early 20s when I still went to uni. At that time I just thought it was stress related. Since thats also what the doctors kept telling me. „Its stress, learn to destress, do sports, no caffeine in the afternoon, no blue light at night, go to bed early, no alcohol,…“. Thats what I kept hearing for years. 
I tried every OTC sleep aid I could find. Didn‘t help. Until my doc prescribed me some real sleeping pills. I was so happy when I got them - finally some release! But even they didn‘t do much for me and I was afraid to get addicted, so after a couple of days I stopped taking the pills.

My insomnia was severely impacting my mental health at that point. Anxiety, depression, lethargy, headaches, you name it. I started medicating myself with weed. I liked it, but it still didn‘t do much for my sleep. At some point I was experimenting with my diet because I thought carbs and gluten are the problem. I finally had a breakthrough when I stopped eating dairy. It only took a couple of days to see improvements in my sleep. And then finally it went normal. I went to bed, closed my eyes, fell asleep, woke up 7-8 hours later. Pure bliss. So now I knew what caused my issues, but I wanted to be absolutely certain, because I love dairy so much… Splash of milk in my coffee, yogurt with fruit, cheese,…I ate a big bowl of yogurt with some fruit and had milk in the coffee I drank during work. When I went to bed it was like before. Nothing happened. I just lay there. No racing heart, no intrusive thoughts. My body just refused to fall asleep. 

So no more dairy for me. Before you ask I also played around with lactose free, sheep and goat dairy. All the same for me sadly. But its a small price to pay for sound sleep. ",1,1733474717.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------

Have you ever considered the idea of a water fast? A 3-day water fast can sound intimidating, but many people have experienced remarkable benefits from it. Let's explore how this practice can enhance your health and well-being.

### The Basics of a Water Fast

During a water fast, you consume only water for a set period, in this case, three days. Fasting can trigger several beneficial physiological responses in your body. Though it may feel challenging, the results can be worth the effort.

### Weight Loss

One of the most immediate benefits of a 3-day water fast is weight loss. During this time, your body uses stored fat for energy, leading to a reduction in body weight. Here's how it works:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Caloric Deficit:** By consuming no food, you create a significant caloric deficit.
- **Fat Utilization:** Your body begins to burn fat reserves as its primary energy source.

Many individuals report losing several pounds during this short period, which can be a motivating factor to continue with healthier eating habits afterward.

### Improved Insulin Sensitivity

Another incredible benefit of a 3-day water fast is improved insulin sensitivity. Fasting helps regulate blood sugar levels. When you give your digestive system a break, your body can improve how it responds to insulin. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes. The process works as follows:

- **Reduced Blood Sugar Levels:** Short-term fasting helps lower blood glucose levels.
- **Enhanced Cellular Function:** Fasting promotes better insulin receptor function.

### Cellular Repair and Autophagy

Autophagy is a vital process that removes damaged cells and regenerates new ones. A 3-day water fast activates autophagy, leading to numerous health benefits:

- **Cellular Cleansing:** It helps clear out debris and damaged cells.
- **Enhanced Repair Mechanisms:** New, healthier cells can positively impact your overall health.

This process may also play a role in preventing chronic diseases, making it an essential benefit of fasting.

### Improved Mental Clarity

Many people report heightened mental clarity during and after a water fast. This can be attributed to various factors:

- **Reduced Brain Fog:** By eliminating heavy foods, you can experience improved focus.
- **Increased Ketone Production:** When fasting, your body produces ketones, which are beneficial for brain health.

Enhanced mental performance can lead to increased productivity in daily tasks.

### Better Digestion

Giving your digestive system a break can lead to better digestion long-term. It allows your gut to reset and heal. Key points include:

- **Reduced Inflammation:** Fasting can lower inflammation in your gut.
- **Restored Microbiome Balance:** The fasting period can support a healthier gut microbiome.

Many individuals find their digestive issues subside after completing a water fast.

### Emotional and Spiritual Benefits

A 3-day water fast can also yield emotional and spiritual growth. People often find clarity and a sense of purpose during this time. By stepping away from routine eating and reflecting on your goals, you might uncover:

- **Heightened Self-Awareness:** Time away from food can bring clarity to your thoughts.
- **Sense of Accomplishment:** Completing a fast can boost your confidence and resilience.

This intentional pause can lead to self-discovery and empowerment.

As you consider embarking on a 3-day water fast, remember to listen to your body and prepare adequately. Consulting with a healthcare professional beforehand is always a wise choice, especially if you have underlying health concerns. The benefits of a 3-day water fast can be profound, including weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and greater mental clarity.

Are you ready to experience these amazing benefits?

How a 3 Day Water Fast Impacts Your Body's Metabolism
-----------------------------------------------------

When considering a 3-day water fast, many people wonder how it affects the body's metabolism. Understanding this can help you make an informed decision about your health journey. Let’s explore the fascinating ways your body’s metabolism responds during this fasting period.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### What Happens to Your Metabolism

During a 3-day water fast, your body goes through several metabolic changes. Initially, your body relies on glucose for energy. As fasting continues, it depletes its glycogen stores – the stored form of glucose found in your liver and muscles. Here’s what happens next:

- **Day 1:** Your body starts to utilize glucose for energy. Insulin levels drop, which helps your body begin the transition to burning fat for fuel.
- **Day 2:** Once glycogen stores are low, your body shifts towards breaking down fat. This process is called lipolysis, and it helps free fatty acids to be used as energy.
- **Day 3:** At this stage, your metabolism relies heavily on ketones, which are produced from fat breakdown. This metabolic state is known as ketosis, where your body becomes efficient at burning fat.

### Potential Benefits of a 3-Day Water Fast

Engaging in a 3-day water fast can lead to various benefits beyond just weight loss. Here are some noteworthy effects on your metabolism and overall health:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Improved Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting can enhance insulin sensitivity, which means your body can use insulin more effectively. This can help regulate blood sugar levels and lower the risk of diabetes.
- **Enhanced Fat Oxidation:** As your body adapts to fasting, it becomes adept at burning fat for energy. This not only helps with weight loss but may also reduce the risk of metabolic diseases.
- **Cellular Repair Processes:** Fasting triggers autophagy, a cellular repair process where your cells recycle damaged components. This can support overall metabolic health and longevity.
- **Reduced Inflammation:** Studies suggest that fasting can lower inflammation markers in the body. This reduction can improve metabolic function and decrease the risk of chronic diseases.

### How to Prepare for a 3-Day Water Fast

Proper preparation can significantly enhance your fasting experience and outcomes. Here are some tips to consider before starting:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Begin drinking plenty of water in the days leading up to the fast. This will help your body adjust better.
- **Eat Nutrient-Dense Foods:** Consume whole foods rich in nutrients like fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. This helps optimize your body’s energy stores.
- **Gradually Reduce Food Intake:** Prior to the fast, you might want to taper down your meals to avoid drastic changes.

### Listening to Your Body

During the fasting period, it’s vital to pay attention to how your body feels. You may experience hunger pangs, fatigue, or headaches, especially in the initial stages. Here’s how to manage those sensations:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Stay Busy:** Keeping yourself engaged can help distract from hunger.
- **Rest Adequately:** It’s essential to listen to your body and ensure you get enough rest. A lack of energy can make you feel tired.
- **Monitor Your Hydration:** Continue to drink water throughout the fast. Staying hydrated is crucial for minimizing discomfort.

After completing a 3-day water fast, you should also focus on how to break the fast properly. Start with light meals that are easy on your digestive system, such as broths or smoothies.

Embracing a water fast can be a transformative experience for your body’s metabolism. It helps reset your energy levels and improve metabolic function. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting a fasting regimen, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions. This approach allows you to maximize the benefits while ensuring safety and sustainability in your fasting journey.

Mental Clarity and Focus During a 3 Day Water Fast
--------------------------------------------------

Many people seek clarity and focus in their everyday lives, often finding it elusive amidst the chaos of modern living. Engaging in a 3-day water fast can profoundly enhance mental clarity and cognitive focus. This fasting method not only contributes to physical well-being but also offers remarkable benefits to your mind.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
During a 3-day water fast, your body undergoes several changes that promote mental clarity. Initially, the body depletes its stored carbohydrates, leading to a metabolic switch from glucose to ketones. Ketones are produced from fat and become the primary energy source during fasting. This shift can enhance brain function in multiple ways:

- **Enhanced Neurotransmitter Activity:** Fasting increases the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports neuron growth and repair. Higher BDNF levels improve mood and cognitive functions, allowing for sharper thinking.
- **Reduced Brain Fog:** As your body transitions to utilizing ketones, many individuals report a significant reduction in brain fog. Instead of feeling sluggish, you may find your thoughts becoming more lucid, leading to heightened focus.
- **Increased Mental Resilience:** A 3-day fast can strengthen your mental resilience. As you navigate through potential discomfort and hunger, you learn to manage distractions and develop a more profound sense of self-discipline.

Another key aspect of water fasting is the impact on cortisol levels. Cortisol is a hormone associated with stress. When fasting, your body can normalize cortisol levels, reducing stress and anxiety. A more balanced state can lead to improved mental clarity, making it easier to concentrate on tasks.

The detoxification that occurs during a water fast also contributes to mental sharpness. As your body goes without food, it begins to cleanse itself of harmful toxins. This detox process can alleviate mental fatigue, allowing you to think more clearly and creatively. Many participants in a 3-day water fast report feelings of lightness and improved mental agility.

One fascinating aspect of fasting is its influence on mindfulness. When you're not preoccupied with meal planning or eating, you create space for reflection and contemplation. This quiet time can enhance your focus on present tasks and sharpen your decision-making abilities. It allows you to approach challenges with newfound perspectives and clarity.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
During the fast, you may notice that your senses become heightened. This phenomenon is often due to the absence of external stimuli from food consumption. Colors may appear more vibrant, sounds may become clearer, and the taste of water itself may be more pronounced. This sensory amplification can lead to a more immersive experience of your environment, enhancing your ability to concentrate.

Here are some practical tips for maximizing mental clarity during your 3-day water fast:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Stay Hydrated:** Ensure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the fast. Proper hydration supports cognitive function and helps keep your mind sharp.
- **Limit Distractions:** Create a distraction-free environment. This might mean turning off electronic devices or finding a quiet space for yourself.
- **Engage in Light Activity:** Gentle activities like walking or yoga can help maintain energy levels without overexerting yourself, keeping your mind alert.
- **Practice Mindfulness:** Use meditation or deep-breathing exercises to cultivate a sense of calm and improve your focus. These practices can enhance your mental clarity and reduce feelings of stress.

As tempting as it is to think of food during your fast, shifting your attention to other activities can help keep your mind engaged. Reading, journaling, or engaging in creative projects can stimulate your brain, making the fasting period feel more fulfilling.

It’s crucial to listen to your body during the fasting process. While many people experience increased mental clarity, everyone’s journey is unique. If you notice signs of distress or prolonged discomfort, consider adjusting your approach to fasting. Maintaining a balance between your body and mind is essential for reaping the full benefits of a 3-day water fast.

Embarking on a 3-day water fast can be a transformative experience for both your body and mind. By enhancing mental clarity and focus, fasting can open pathways to deeper self-awareness and improved cognitive functioning. Whether you’re seeking to boost your productivity or simply gain clearer insights, a short water fast could be the key to unlocking your mental potential.

Preparing for a Successful 3 Day Water Fast: Tips and Tricks
------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some valuable tips and tricks to help you prepare for your fast.

### Set Realistic Goals

Your intentions for fasting should be clear. Whether you are fasting for spiritual reasons, detoxification, or weight management, knowing your motivation will help you stay focused and committed throughout the three days.

### Gradual Transition to Fasting

A sudden switch to a water fast can be challenging. Instead, ease into it by reducing your food intake in the days leading up to the fast. Consider these steps:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Day 1-2:** Incorporate lighter meals; focus on fruits, vegetables, and hydration.
- **Day 3:** Reduce your intake to broth and juice to prepare your body.

### Hydrate Properly

Proper hydration is essential since you will be consuming only water. Begin hydrating a few days in advance. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water daily to prepare your body for the fast. During the fast, listen to your body and drink water whenever you feel thirsty.

### Gather Supplies

Having the right tools on hand can make your fasting experience smoother. Consider these items:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Bottled or filtered water
- A comfortable place to rest
- Herbal teas (caffeine-free)
- A journal to document your experience

### Avoid Caffeine and Sugar

Caffeine and sugar can lead to withdrawal symptoms during your fast, which may make the experience more challenging. Try eliminating these substances from your diet a few days prior to starting your fast. This will help make your transition smoother and reduce cravings.

### Plan Your Schedule

During your fasting period, your energy levels might drop. That’s why it’s essential to plan your days. Try to keep your schedule light and avoid strenuous activities. Engage in low-energy tasks and prioritize rest. Here are some ideas for activities:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Gentle yoga or stretching
- Meditation or mindfulness practices
- Light reading or journaling

### Prepare for Possible Side Effects

It’s common to experience hunger pangs, irritability, or fatigue when fasting. Being aware of these potential side effects can help you mentally prepare. If you feel faint or unwell, it’s essential to listen to your body and consider breaking the fast if necessary.

### Post-Fast Recovery

Once you complete your 3 day fast, the way you break your fast is critical. Start with small, light meals that are easy to digest, such as:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Broth or soup
- Steamed vegetables
- Fruit juices (freshly squeezed)

Avoid heavy meals immediately after your fast, as they can shock your digestive system.

### Reflect on Your Experience

After completing your fast, take time to reflect. What did you learn about yourself? How did your body respond? Documenting your thoughts can provide insights that may encourage future fasting endeavors or other healthy lifestyles.

Common Misconceptions About Water Fasting and Health
----------------------------------------------------

Water fasting has gained popularity in recent years as a method for detoxification and weight loss. However, with this trend come various misconceptions that can mislead and create confusion. Let’s clear up some of the most common misunderstandings about water fasting and its impact on health.

### Water Fasting Is Just a Trend

Many people believe that water fasting is merely a fleeting fad, but this practice has roots that trace back thousands of years. Ancient cultures, including the Greeks and Egyptians, used fasting for health benefits and spiritual growth. People today are returning to this practice, inspired by its historical significance and modern scientific research supporting its advantages.

### Water Fasting Equals Starvation

One major misconception is that water fasting equates to starvation. While both involve a lack of food intake, they're not the same. In a water fast, your body undergoes beneficial processes such as autophagy, where cells remove damaged components. This differs from starvation, where your body is deprived of nutrients for prolonged periods, leading to harmful effects.

### You Can’t Lose Weight With Water Fasting

Some skeptics argue that fasting will not lead to weight loss. On the contrary, many individuals report significant weight loss after engaging in a three-day water fast. When the body is deprived of food, it resorts to using stored fat for energy. This process can lead to rapid weight loss, although most of it may be water weight initially.

### Water Fasting Is Dangerous for Everyone

While water fasting can pose risks for certain individuals, such as those with specific health conditions, it is generally safe for healthy adults when done properly. Before attempting a fast, consult a healthcare professional, especially if you have underlying issues like diabetes or eating disorders. In most cases, healthy individuals can benefit from short-term fasting without adverse effects.

### This Will Make You Weak and Tired

A common fear is that water fasting will leave you feeling weak and fatigued. Initially, you may experience some fatigue and irritability, but many people report an increase in energy levels after a few days. Your body often adapts to the fasting state, resulting in heightened mental clarity and focus. Reports frequently describe a sense of euphoria and enhanced physical performance after the initial adjustment period.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Fasting Means You Can’t Drink Anything

Another misconception is that while fasting, you can’t consume anything at all. However, during a water fast, you can and should drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated is crucial to support your body's functions during this time. Some practitioners even allow herbal teas or black coffee, though these should be minimized to pure water for optimal benefits.

### It’s Not Good for Detoxing

Some individuals dismiss water fasting as ineffective for detoxification. However, when you fast, your digestive system gets a break, allowing your body to focus on detoxifying and healing itself. Research shows that water fasting can stimulate the liver and kidneys to aid in detoxification processes more efficiently. By drinking plenty of water, you also promote urination, which helps flush out toxins

### After the Fast, You Can Eat Anything

Many people mistakenly believe they can return to normal eating habits immediately after a fast. However, this can lead to discomfort and even health issues. Instead, it’s important to gradually reintroduce food into your diet. Begin with light meals, such as broths or soft fruits, and slowly increase food diversity over the next few days.

### Fasted State Is Just for Weight Loss

While weight loss is a significant motivation for many, it isn’t the sole benefit of fasting. A three-day water fast can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and enhance heart health. Research has indicated that fasting could even bolster immune function and longevity, making it a holistic approach to health.

The misconception surrounding water fasting can deter individuals from reaping its potential benefits. Understanding the myths and truths allows you to approach fasting with a more informed perspective, facilitating a healthier lifestyle. Consider the information shared, evaluate your circumstances, and always prioritize your health and well-being.

### Conclusion

A 3-day water fast can offer numerous benefits, making it an intriguing choice for many seeking to boost their health. As we've explored, this fasting method impacts your body’s metabolism positively, allowing it to enter a state of ketosis. During this period, your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy, which can kickstart your weight loss journey.

Additionally, individuals often report enhanced mental clarity and focus while fasting. This heightened state of awareness can lead to improved productivity and creativity, as your brain benefits from the calorie restrictions and a reduction in sugar fluctuations. It is important to prepare yourself before diving into a 3-day water fast. Following the tips and tricks discussed, such as gradually reducing food intake and staying hydrated, can make your fasting experience more comfortable and effective.

Did I take it too far?,"Here it is situation, girlfriend and I have been on the outs since thanksgiving due to flying and her yelling at me in the airport.  We have a child together 9months)

>  
I brought up real concerns about Janet’s well-being, and instead of addressing them, you accused me of “fabricating” or “sensationalizing.” That’s not just disrespectful—it’s unnecessary. I haven’t insulted you, and I’d appreciate the same in return. If you want to keep this civil, then I suggest we focus on the actual issues. Betty is 34 years old, not a child, but you are treating her like one. You won’t always be around, so wouldn’t it make sense to help her grow into a responsible parent now?

>I appreciate your acknowledgment of how I care for Janet. Spending time with Kerry, Candy, Mara, Trae, Shane, and Mike was enjoyable, and they were kind.

>That said, I came to you about Janet because I was concerned about Betty’s recent poor judgment. Instead of addressing that, you deflected and twisted the narrative to make me the problem while protecting Betty’s ego. Honestly, since I’ve known you, you’ve been quick to stroke Betty’s victim narrative and play the role of a yes-man, no matter the circumstances or who’s involved. But let’s be clear: there is NO acceptable reason for Janet to have been left alone—NONE. Your mental gymnastics to excuse and rationalize these situations are enabling at its finest. Every time you twist the narrative to make her choices seem acceptable or shift the blame onto someone else, you reinforce the idea that she doesn’t need to reflect, improve, or take responsibility for her actions. How can she grow as a parent when you constantly step in to justify her mistakes?

>You bring up me taking a shower while Janet was asleep as though it’s comparable to Betty leaving the house without ensuring Janet’s care was communicated. It’s not. I was in the next room, and Janet was asleep in a safe environment. That’s far from leaving a child unattended. Comparing me leaving Janet at a licensed childcare facility to Betty handing her off to random parents during gymnastics is another reach. One is a professional service; the other is outsourcing responsibility to anyone with a pulse.

>At the airport, this isn’t about who had the stroller or luggage—it’s about Betty disappearing in a high-stress situation and making things harder. Yelling at me in public only escalated it. That behavior doesn’t get a pass just because it’s inconvenient to acknowledge.

>You claim I’ve exaggerated, yet you inflate minor details to deflect from Betty’s repeated poor decisions. Those examples have nothing to do with the airport or why I reached out. Whether they’re true or not doesn’t matter—they’re irrelevant. Comparing my actions to hers is false. I didn’t leave Janet in unsafe situations, and I don’t take off from being a father because I’m overwhelmed—period.

>If you keep dismissing Betty’s missteps instead of encouraging her to improve, how will she grow as a parent? Shielding her from accountability doesn’t help her or Janet. Betty needs someone to push her to regulate better for her daughter, not someone who pretends everything is fine. You are quick to call out and acknowledge my missteps—why is it so hard for you to hold her to the same standard?

>I came to you for support for Janet—not excuses for Betty’s behavior. Just to remind you: leaving a child unattended is unacceptable (and “he made coffee” is a bullshit excuse). Yelling at your partner in a crowded airport is unacceptable. Disappearing in a crowded airport is unacceptable. These aren’t accidents—they’re choices, and excusing them only makes the situation worse for Janet.

>At this point, I see no value in continuing this conversation. If protecting Betty’s ego is more important than Janet’s well-being, then this conversation is a waste of time. I mean, the fact that I even have to explain why these behaviors are unacceptable is disappointing, but if you can't acknowledge leaving a 9-month-old unattended is BAD, then who are you really protecting here?",1,1733473579.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I’ve been to multiple PCPs about this issue and a derm but no one has been able to help. 

Since junior year of college, around 6 years ago, I started getting red, blistering patches of rashes on my fingers and hands. It would come and go and has persisted all this time even though I’ve changed my environment (living across the country, living in 4 different places, changing soaps and diet and everything). 

I eventually realized, junior year of college is when I started drinking tea. I would use an electric tea kettle and have black tea with honey multiple times a day. I wasn’t a big coffee drinker so this was tasty and warm and nice to have. 

I’ve noticed that whenever I had tea, I would more often than not get rashes. However, even if I didn’t have tea, sometimes the rashes would flare up again. 

Now here we are, I haven’t had a rash in months, but on Black Friday I bought myself a Nespresso since I’ve been getting into coffee more (nothing crazy just an occasional Starbucks, which did not set off any rashes). 

Anyways my rashes are back. I found this journal on the topic. Which led me to consult Reddit and I found this sub but no historical posts about Nespresso machines so thought I’d ask. And yes I will eventually go back to the doctor when my deductible resets at the beginning of the year so I can just hit it early.
