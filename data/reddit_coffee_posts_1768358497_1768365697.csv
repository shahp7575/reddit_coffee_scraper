1qcdzny,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qcdzny/sciencebased_ways_to_bring_back_happiness_energy/,"Science-Based Ways to Bring Back Happiness, Energy, and Fun in Just 1 Week","I've been noticing this weird pattern lately. Everyone around me seems drained. Like genuinely exhausted but not from overworking, more from just existing? We're all scrolling, consuming, busy as hell, but somehow empty. I got curious and started digging into research, podcasts, neuroscience stuff, and honestly, what I found changed how I think about happiness entirely.

Turns out our brains weren't designed for the way we're living right now. Constant notifications, sitting all day, zero sunlight, processed everything. Our dopamine system is completely fried. But here's the thing: small tweaks can actually rewire this. I tested a bunch of techniques from various sources over the past few months, and these six genuinely worked. Not life-changing overnight, but noticeable shifts in mood and energy within a week.

Get sunlight within 30 minutes of waking up

Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. Morning light hits photoreceptors in your eyes and kickstarts your circadian rhythm, which basically controls everything: mood, energy, and sleep quality. Just 10 minutes outside without sunglasses makes a massive difference. I started doing this while drinking coffee, and it's wild how much more awake I feel throughout the day. Your body literally needs this signal to know it's daytime and to produce cortisol at the right time.

Move your body in a way that doesn't feel like punishment

Exercise for mental health isn't about burning calories or looking a certain way. It's about neurochemicals. When you move, your brain releases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which is like fertiliser for your neurons. Dance badly in your room, go for a walk, do yoga, whatever. The book “Spark” by John Ratey, a Harvard psychiatry professor, breaks down how exercise is more effective than most antidepressants for mild to moderate depression. Insanely good read if you want the science behind why movement matters so much. You don't need a gym membership or motivation, just 20 minutes of movement you don't hate.

Do one thing that requires focus without multitasking

Our attention spans are destroyed. We're watching TV while scrolling and texting. Your brain never gets a break and never experiences real satisfaction. Pick anything, draw, cook, read, build something, and do ONLY that for 30 minutes. Cal Newport's “Deep Work” explores how our brains crave this kind of focused attention and how rare it's become. The satisfaction you get from completing something with full attention is a completely different type of happiness than passive consumption gives you. It feels like an accomplishment instead of a distraction.

There's an app called “Finch” that gamifies self-care and habit-building in the cutest way possible. You take care of a little bird by doing daily check-ins, journaling, and setting goals. Sounds silly, but it actually works because it gives you external accountability and makes tiny habits feel rewarding.

Another tool worth checking out is “BeFreed”, an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books on topics like mental health and habit formation to create personalised audio content and adaptive learning plans. If you're trying to build better routines or understand the psychology behind happiness, you can ask it to generate a plan specifically around that, like ""how to build sustainable daily habits as someone with low energy."" You can customise the depth, too, a quick 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The voice options are actually pretty addictiv. Youu can pick anything from a calm, soothing tone to something more energetic, depending on your mood.

Connect with someone without a screen

Loneliness is an epidemic right now, and we're more ""connected"" than ever, which is the ironic part. Call someone, meet for coffee, have an actual conversation. Researcher Johann Hari wrote “Lost Connections” after studying depression globally, and one of the biggest factors he found was disconnection from meaningful relationships. Not surface-level stuff, real vulnerable conversations. Even once a week makes a difference. We're social creatures biologically; our brains literally need real human interaction to regulate emotions and feel safe.

Limit decision fatigue by creating tiny routines

Every small decision drains your mental energy. What to eat, what to wear, what to watch. Barack Obama wore the same suit every day for this exact reason. Create one simple routine, same breakfast, same morning walk route, same bedtime. Sounds boring, but it frees up mental space for things that actually matter. The book “Atomic Habits” by James Clear explains how reducing friction around positive behaviours makes them automatic. You're not being rigid, you're being strategic about where your brain spends energy.

Consume something that actually teaches you something

Most of what we consume is designed to keep us scrolling, not to enrich us. Swap 30 minutes of mindless scrolling for a podcast or book that challenges how you think. “The Happiness Lab”podcast by Dr Laurie Santos is perfect for this; she's a Yale professor who teaches the most popular class at Yale about the science of happiness. Every episode breaks down research in a super accessible way. Or try “Hidden Brain” with Shankar Vedantam for understanding human behaviour patterns.

For books, “The Body Keeps the Score” by Bessel van der Kolk is life-changing if you want to understand how trauma and stress live in your body and why traditional talk therapy doesn't always work. He's one of the world's leading trauma researchers, and this book will make you question everything you think you know about healing and mental health. Not a light read, but absolutely worth it.

You don't need to overhaul your entire life or become a different person. Just try these for one week and see what shifts. The point isn't perfection, it's noticing what makes you feel more like yourself again. Start with two or three that feel easiest and build from there. Small, consistent actions compound way faster than you'd think.",1,1768365565.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

I'm 36. I drink. Not every day. Just socially. Wine nights with my girlfriends. Happy hours after work. Cocktails on vacation. A few drinks at dinner parties on the weekends. Normal stuff. Nothing excessive. But lately I can't shake this feeling that I'm slowly destroying my liver and just... pretending it's fine? Like I'll be on my second glass of wine having a great time with friends and this little voice in the back of my head goes ""you're damaging yourself right now and you know it."" And then I feel guilty. But I keep drinking. Because what am I supposed to do, be the weird one who doesn't drink? I've started noticing things. Or maybe I'm being paranoid. I don't know. I feel more tired than I used to. A little more foggy on Mondays. Sometimes there's this dull heaviness on my right side that I try not to think about. Nothing serious. No diagnosis. No scary blood work. Just... a feeling that something isn't right. And I keep ignoring it because I don't want to deal with what it might mean. I've tried stuff. I really have. I drink a ton of water now. Like way more than I used to. I figured if I stay hydrated it'll help my liver process everything better? No idea if that's even how it works. I drink coffee every morning because I read somewhere it's good for your liver. But I was already drinking coffee anyway so who knows. I've tried having ""dry days"" during the week. That lasted maybe a month before life got busy and I stopped keeping track. I eat healthier than I used to. More vegetables. Less fried stuff. I keep telling myself that balances things out somehow. I tried one of those ""liver cleanse"" things. Lemon water, apple cider vinegar, some disgusting green juice for a week. Felt awful the whole time. Probably did nothing. I even tried those detox teas for a while. Pretty sure that was just expensive pee. None of it feels like it's actually DOING anything. It just feels like I'm checking boxes to make myself feel less guilty while I keep doing the thing that's probably hurting me. The thing is... I don't WANT to stop drinking. I love my social life. I love wine nights. I love the way a drink takes the edge off after a stressful week. I'm not ready to give that up. I'm 36, not 86. But I also don't want to wake up at 45 with liver damage wondering why I didn't do something sooner. My dad's friend had cirrhosis. He wasn't even a heavy drinker. Just consistent. For years. And then one day it caught up with him. That story lives in my head rent-free every time I pour a glass of wine. I feel completely stuck. Like I'm doing all these random things—the water, the coffee, the dry days, the healthy eating—and I have absolutely no idea if any of it is actually protecting me or if I'm just lying to myself while the damage quietly adds up year after year. Is there even a way to actually protect your liver if you're not ready to quit drinking? Or is that just not a thing?

I honestly don't know anymore. I feel like I'm just guessing and hoping for the best.

Does anyone else feel this way? Like you're stuck between loving something and being scared of what it's doing to you?

1qcdz0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1qcdz0v/most_people_wait_for_permission_that_never_comes/,Most people wait for permission that never comes.," They sit back, hoping someone else will make the first move, extend the invitation, or take the risk. Meanwhile, opportunities slip away because everyone's waiting for everyone else.

I've noticed something about the people who actually get what they want. They're not necessarily smarter or more talented. They just go first. They're the ones who reach out, who suggest the coffee meeting, who pitch the wild idea in the room. Sure, they get told ""no"" more often. They face awkward silences and rejections that sting. But they also get the yes that changes everything.

You know what's interesting? The fear of rejection keeps most people frozen, but rejection is just information. When you go first and it doesn't work out, you learn and move on. When it does work out, you get all the credit because you were brave enough to initiate. The world notices people who step up because it's genuinely rare.

So what are you waiting for? Send that message. Propose that project. Share that unconventional idea. The worst that happens is you're back where you started, but with more courage than before. The best that happens? You create the exact opportunities you've been hoping would find you.

1qcdyyr,https://i.redd.it/xzbu39jju8dg1.jpeg,Furniture layout advice :),"Hello, I’m hoping to get some advice on how to best lay out and style my lounge / dining area. 

It’s a relatively small apartment living space and I’m struggling with furniture placement more than anything — especially where the TV, sofa, desk, and storage should go without the room feeling cramped or awkward. I want it to feel balanced, functional, and not like everything is pushed against the walls “just because.”

A few notes:
- the heater on the south wall has been removed 
- I need to include a desk/workspace
- A dining table isn’t important — I’m happy eating at the coffee table
- I need space for a record player and TV
- My TV is a Samsung Serif, so it can be on legs or placed on a shelf/unit
- Still want it to feel cosy and lived-in, not sterile

I’ve attached a floor plan to help give context.

Any suggestions on layout, furniture type / positioning, or things I should avoid would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!

We were given warnings a few days ago that we’d be experiencing some sort of solar phenomena. Something to do with the Sun’s heat entering our atmosphere? I don’t know, I’m not an astrologist. I am a 34 year old guy, who’s typing on a subreddit, looking for answers. 

I can’t even imagine that weeks ago I was outside, mowing the lawn. My wife and kids were playing in the backyard. 

We can’t go outside anymore. My youngest son, Nelson, snuck out once while I had my back turned. I was cooking my lovely wife Jessie breakfast, too lost in the moment to hear the front door open and shut behind me. The screaming started shortly after. I rushed to the door and yanked it open to see my son covered in 2nd degree burns. His whole body glowing red. We were extremely lucky to have found him before he burned to pieces. No amount of aloe vera could’ve undone the damage Nelson suffered already. That was 2 weeks ago.

Ever since the incident, we laid a few ground rules. No going outside. No getting too close to windows. Always stay downstairs. I even started collecting water in small containers. Jessie closed blinds, and pulled mattresses down the stairs. We have our own little bunker.

I was scared at first, what would happen next. Every hour that went by seemed like a countdown to the end. Our TV stopped working days ago. The last thing that played was the same old news broadcast that has been airing for the past couple weeks. 

STAY INSIDE. WE ARE EXPERIENCING WORLD RECORD TEMPERATURES. HEAT WARNING. STAY INSIDE. 

Now I’ve accepted it. The world is going to end. All in hellfire. It is going to take away my family. My love. My life.

2 days it nearly took away Ben, my oldest. There was a noise outside, we assumed that a large building had collapsed. Jessie mentioned that it could be possible that the Sun was already beginning to melt the steel complexes around our neighborhood. I told her something along the lines of ”That definitely could be true, but it’s best not to find out”. This sparked Ben’s curiosity, as he immediately dropped his DS and ran over to us. He’s only 13. 

“Why can’t we look outside to see if stuff is melting Dad?” 

I warned him that we simply must keep away from the light. We have no idea what is behind those blinds. I gave him every possible, certifiable, reason to not look outside. Yet, later that day I dozed off with my wife on the couch. I opened my eyes only to see a figure amassed in light.

Ben had opened the blinds. 

“Dad! I can see-” 

It was agony. The sound of pure agony that drove me to my feet. I can feel the heat several feet away, and with each step it got more intense. I closed my eyes, trusting myself to find my way to the window. For what felt like ages, I fumbled until I could twist the blinds down. I heard them shut and I slowly opened my eyes. My hands were red. Actually, my whole body was red. Like I was sunburned. My son was slumped to the floor, cradled in a fetal position against the coffee table. 

“My eyes, dad! My eyes!” He kept repeating, his face buried in his hands.

I coaxed him until I could eventually pry his hands away. Ben’s face was caked in burns, half of it appeared to be melting off. His eyes. I couldn’t forget his eyes. They were entirely red. It looked like someone had taken a fire poker and jammed it into his sockets. Thankfully, Jessie was right behind me with a first aid kit and dampened rags. She patched him up, and wrapped bandages around his face. My eldest son is now mummified. 

I as well as Nelson have done my best to take care of Ben. He hasn’t eaten in the last 24 hours. We have to slip straws between his bandages and force him to drink water. Jessie went quiet after the incident. She stays around the couch, occasionally getting up to assist me with chores. The power went out not long ago. Maybe 26 hours have passed? I don’t know, but every day the light outside seems to get brighter. We are running out of water. I’m not sure how long we have left. The kids are being moved to the basement tonight. The living room is starting to grow warmer.

My phone is about dead, and I am losing signal. If you receive this, I’m not sure if I’ll still be alive by then. Once again. My name is Will Braham. It is the year 2087. I have a wife named Jessie, and two sons, Nelson and Ben. I don’t know how much time we have left. Please help us.

We went on 4 dates and honestly the first couple went really well. First date was coffee, second date was a nicer Italian place and we stayed until they were basically closing. Third date was a long drive where we talked about a lot of personal stuff.

On that third date she asked about my dating history. I was honest and told her I’ve never really dated before and don’t have much experience with intimacy. After that her energy changed and she told me she just wanted to be friends. I told her I’m not looking for friends and we stopped talking.

A few days later she messaged me after midnight on New Year’s saying she missed me. We started talking again and she said she feels a connection but doesn’t know what kind, and that she still only wants to be friends. I told her again I don’t want to be friends, but I’d be okay taking things slow and seeing where it goes. She agreed.

We talked pretty much every day, but I noticed whenever I flirted she’d pull back. Eventually I stopped initiating. After that she asked to see me after work but said she could only hang out for about an hour.

When we met up, instead of coffee she asked if we could drive around to some stores so she could prep for a birthday trip with her friends. I agreed. We’ve never kissed, and when I tried before she pulled away. At the end of the hangout she left quickly, but said she’d be open to hanging out longer the next weekend.

Normally I’d text after saying I had a good time. This time I didn’t. I felt like I was being kept in this weird in-between spot and like my boundary of not wanting to just be friends wasn’t really being respected. 

Her birthday came up that weekend and I didn’t reach out and We haven’t talked since.

Now I feel kind of torn. Part of me feels guilty for not wishing her happy birthday and wonders if that was a shitty thing to do. Another part of me feels exhausted constantly trying to figure out where I stand and thinks letting it fade was probably for the best.

I go everyday on time and do my work diligently but there is a group of people in my lab that deeply annoys me. We are not that big lab actually, around 12 people. 

This group consists of lab techs, post docs, senior PhD student (who is beyond deadline with so much left to do). This bunch of people never come on time or regularly, when they do come anyways, they go on excessively long coffee breaks and sit in cafeteria, whenever they’re in the lab, they keep on talking. And the things they say also doesn’t make sense, they’re totally non-scientific. It’s like they’re not serious at all but when out PI asks something, they start being pretentious that they know so much. This annoys me because:

1) it doesn’t maintain a good working environment in the lab. 

2) having fun is okay but I feel this is excessive and a waste of time. 

3) they drag other people with them, and if you don’t socialise with them then they kinda isolate you out. They stopped inviting me to after work events, which felt bad but again, I don’t like the things they used to talk about anyways.

4) it lowers the intellectual level of the lab. Whenever there are lab meeting, I don’t think I get good inputs because I feel they are just not intellectually sound to comprehend stuff! 

5) talking to them doesn’t add anything new to my life or work, it’s just life drama. Also their conversations has a lot of cussing sometimes, which I am not comfortable with. 

I am confused on how do I maintain a professional relationship with such people and be able to maintain boundaries when the only way to be on talking terms seems to be just by hanging out with them, or they all group up and isolate me! ",0,1768364920.0,PhD,2,0.5,False

I am a 20 year old college student working as a support worker and studying, meaning my pay checks are not on a set day and are quite random. I should be getting a steady-ish weekly income soon when i solidify weekly clients. I live at home so my biggest costs yearly really are my big car payments and fuel, the rest is savings, travel, investing, fun money, etc. But as I have started i'm realising its a lot more than what I'm used to earning and I want to start saving and investing, and I need to start budgeting.

I have always loved the idea of bucket budgeting and everyone raves about YNAB so i set it up about two months ago. I'm Australian so my bank can't connect to YNAB, meaning I have to manually update each transaction. As someone with ADHD, I find it quite difficult to do something every night, or stick to a routine, and the whole thing has been really confusing to me because I can't connect my bank, so I honestly just haven't used it at all. I have listened to podcasts, watched youtube videos, and it still seems so daunting despite the fact that I've set it up already... real ADHD move right there.

The biggest thing I want to be able to do is head to the shops and see that I have x amount in my budget for that week, or want a coffee and be able to hop in the app and see that I don't have enough. Because right now, my money in two or three accounts just blends all together and I end up just spending it. For me to be able to use it like that daily, I would have to be updating it daily right? I am also slightly lost on what to do when a pay check comes in, despite trying to learn, 

I'm also confused by my fuel budget as some weeks I use a whole tank and other weeks I only use 1/4, but i fill up every Tuesday either way. So I want to have $90 in it available so if i use only $40 one week, I just top it up to $90. But my budget is saying $360 needed this month, even though i have it set to 'Refill Up to $90.00 Each Week By Tuesday'. Once I put money in it, will it work how I am hoping it will?

I think overall I would really love to hear from people who receive pretty irregular payments/have varying income and from people who don't have their account connected on how you guys do it. 

Do you take 10 minutes each night to add in the transactions you've made that day? 

Do you get your pay check and assign the essentials first? Or know that you will get more in a few days and want to grab a coffee the next day so you do essentials and a bit to daily spending? It's confusing me a bit that i can't just calculate, say, 20% to x fund, 10% to y fund, etc. every paycheck, but I know that system probably won't work for me.

Would I be better off using a different budgeting platform that can connect to my bank? 

Will all of this just come in time and I just have to commit to a few months of trying it out? If so, do you have any tips on what to watch or read or just in general to bite the bullet and commit? And how long does it take to kinda 'get to know' your money, because rn i feel like I'm getting paid and it just disappears. 

Completely understand this is quite messy and confusing but I would really appreciate some guidance. I feel like i'm so close to actually being smart and doing good for myself by budgeting, but I just get too overwhelmed and daunted when i look at it, and really don't want to give up on myself.

So basically two months ago I bought these Star Wars Unlimited trading card holder boxes that hold like 80 cards from the the company GameGen!c at a nearby trading card store. 

When I opened them up, ready to put my cards, in I was met with an overwhelming chemical smell coming from both inside and outside the boxes.

My question is, is this normal for these specific brand of boxes to have or is it not? Does the smell eventually go away? Cuz I dont want this smell to permeate on my cards. Do all trading card boxes, or at least ones with a theme like star wars or ninja turtles or avatar the last airbender, have this type of smell because of the amount of colors/material used when manufacturing the plastic to make them?

Again, I'm new to the hobby of trading cards and collecting/playing so any advice would be appreciated. Ideally, I like these cases but I'd rather get a brand that doesn't have these smell issues.  ",1,1768364869.0,Tradingcards,0,1.0,False

I’m an Indian student currently studying in Bangladesh, and I honestly wouldn’t have gotten into specialty coffee if it wasn’t for this sub. I know this is an Indian coffee sub, but reading posts here pushed me to move beyond instant coffee and actually try better coffee that’s available locally.

North End

Bancoff

I’m still learning (mostly basic home brewing, nothing fancy yet), but it’s been really fun exploring flavors and understanding coffee more. Just wanted to say thanks to this community for influencing my coffee journey even while I’m studying outside India 😄

I’m planning a solo trip (32M) for 11 days, from January 25 to February 6, and I’m torn between Tenerife or Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. I plan to rent a car, do some hiking (nothing too technical), take photos and videos, and enjoy nature. Since I’ll be leaving the cold Canadian winter, I’m also looking for sun and uncrowded beaches.

My goal is to relax, have a coffee in small towns, enjoy nature, and do short hikes that don’t require extensive preparation. I’ve read that Tenerife, especially during high season, can have a party vibe with lots of UK tourists and crowds, which isn’t really what I’m looking for. To give you an idea, I was initially planning to go to Puerto Escondido in Mexico, but I decided against it because it’s more expensive and very touristy at this time of year. I also went to Spain with my girlfriend last year (Barcelona, Costa Blanca, Alicante, etc.). While it was very beautiful, we didn’t enjoy towns that felt overly touristic or lacked a strong cultural aspect, so we tend to avoid that kind of vibe.

As a photographer, I sometimes collaborate with hotels in exchange for a stay, and I may have one lined up in Genovès, Tenerife, but I’d still need to find another place for about a week before that.

I’d love your recommendations on whether I should stick with Tenerife or split my time between Fuerteventura and Lanzarote (via ferry).

Thanks!

Almost every site had at least four working bays and the reliability seems to have finally caught up with the hardware. I found that stopping for twenty minutes at a regional hotspot was enough to grab a coffee and get back on the road without the old anxiety of finding a broken unit.

There was a computer animated show that was made somewhere over seas but dubbed over. I don't remember many details except this.

There was a scene where 2 characters were outside of a house with a treasure chest. They both run into the house carrying the chest. Inside the house was another character, I think it was a rabbit. The rabbit was wearing a loose robe, sipping a cup of coffee. After some dialog, the rabbit said ""is there a sign outside that says treasure chest storage?""

If you don't remember, there was a scene in pulp fiction after John Travolta's character accidentally shot a guy where they went to meet up with Quinton Tarantino's character. He was in a robe, sipping coffee and made a similar comment about a sign outside.

I had an unexplainable experience. I want to say it was during the summer or spring break. That feels more accurate, but it could’ve even been a weekend while school was still in session. 

I have told this story before somewhere on Reddit. It might’ve been here… but I’ll retell it: 

One night I stayed up all night long watching MTV, VH1, and the country music station the entire night. I was having a great time being up by myself listening to some great tunes. I had to have been around 8 or 9. My parents were asleep. My sister and brother were both asleep. My sister may have been spending the night with one of our childhood friends though. Moments like those were rare when I got to be alone watching tv all to myself, so I was loving it. 

Around, I want to say it was between 1-3 AM, feels like it was more the latter end, a car pulled up along the curb. I was like, “Great  🙄 ‘Tink’ is here. Now I’m going to have to go to bed because she’ll take over the tv and the living room.” I assumed it was Tink, my mom’s best friend, because she always came over to our house. I thought it could’ve been any one of my mom’s friends, but I really thought it was just Tink. 

The problem is, she never came over that late in the night. Also, she would’ve called first to see if my mom was awake. I don’t remember any phone call. Suddenly, the kitchen door, which was directly in front of where I sat, but further away (the house was small) started being knocked on, and it sounded urgent. I got up to start heading to the kitchen to open the door, but something stopped me. I think I realized that this was strange and something was up. I sat back down on the couch. They knocked again. And again. Each time more urgent and louder and longer knocking sessions. Then I realized it wasn’t Tink or any of my mom’s friends. They would’ve called out saying, “it’s me, open up please.” They would’ve said something if it was that urgent. Whoever it was knew someone was awake (still had the tv on) for certain a friend of my mom’s would’ve said something. They never said anything. Just stubborn persistent urgent knocking. Started to really creep me out. I knew I was not opening that door. 

I even ended up sliding my body down on the floor by the coffee table to try to hide myself. The knocks even started happening on the door closest to me! Finally it went away and they drove off. I was really very close to opening that door at first. A few times even I almost convinced myself to open it, that it had to be Tink. But I knew it was NOT Tink or anyone familiar. And I’m so glad I paused because their own persistent creepy knocking gave themselves away that they weren’t familiar to me. 

I stayed up the rest of the night until my dad got up for work at 5 am (that detail actually means it wasn’t a weekend and had to have been spring or summer break. I did not tell my dad about it, because I didn’t want him mad at me for staying up so late. But I was relieved it was morning because I felt safe again. Then I went to sleep. 

Tink, or any other friend of mom’s never mentioned anything about it. My mom never mentioned anything. If it really was one of them, I probably would’ve heard about it. One of them surely would’ve said, “I tried coming over to spend the night the other night, but whoever was up didn’t answer the door.” Never heard a single word about it. 

I feel like I avoided something terrible… anyone else have anything like this happen? ",4,1768364040.0,GATEresearch,0,1.0,False

1qcdgox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qcdgox/datingrelationship_advice_pleaseee/,Dating/Relationship advice pleaseee :),"Okay so I dated this woman for about a month and a half. We saw each other a lot, were intimate multiple times, had a lot in common, etc. Everything was going great. I’m a pretty good read on people and I thought she seemed really happy in the relationship too. We both have two kids who are similar ages, are divorced for about a year, and looking for the same things. Then kind of out of the blue she thought it didn’t make sense to keep seeing each other because my kids live 2-3 hours away and I have them every other weekend and am incredibly close with them, but it’s a large distance and she then said she wanted a blended family locally. We broke it off very clean but I was hurt at the time.

Fast forward a couple months and I sent her a card in the mail that was from the heart and in no means would have required her to feel the need to reach out. She then texted me after having not communicated with one another for the last two months, telling me it was very sweet. She seemed open/curious in text but said she’d been seeing someone for the last month which she said wasn’t too serious. I have been seeing someone myself for two months now, which is starting to get quite serious but I still haven’t lost my feelings for this other person. 

I asked if we could meet for a coffee/drink and she said yes, but after a week or so and her asking to push it once, she said we could still meet but things were moving forward in her new relationship. I said “let’s meet” anyway and we did, but it went nowhere…full stop. 

Any ideas on what I may be missing here or how I could have better approached things? We talked about our kids early in dating and mine are around quite a bit, but it’s weekends and weeks in the summer and her’s are around during the weeks more. 

I mean it’s no big deal but it’s twice now that I feel like I got the run around/bait and switch with this person and I really did fall for her harder than I have anyone I can recall. I’m also out-straight and not in the business of wanting to get the run around!

**Synopsis:** 

You (a human vampire-hunter?) were sent to kill the powerful vampire Seraphina. But you seem too ill-prepared and incompetent to accomplish this feat. What are your true intentions? Will Seraphina spare you? Maybe even protect you? There’s something intriguing about you, fearless one.

 

**Script**

Ah, another dreary evening. How shall I entertain myself?

**\[SFX: Loud crash outside\]**

What is that commotion? I think a human is approaching. I can smell his blood from here. What is he doing here? Is he lost? Or, maybe this is yet another vampire-hunter.

**\[SFX: Knocking\]**

He’s actually knocking at my door. Most vampire-hunters don’t openly announce their arrival. Maybe he isn’t a vampire-hunter. I guess the polite thing would be to invite him in. It’s safe for vampires to invite mortals in.

**\[SFX: Sound of door opening\]**

Greetings. Are you lost, little boy? …

*^((Laughing)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* My apologies. I can see that you’re not actually a little boy. But I’m several centuries old, and quite powerful. To me, all human males are little boys …

My name’s Seraphina. And you are…? …

Well, it is nice to meet you.

And if I may say so, you seem rather lost and helpless. So what brings you to my castle, in the middle of the night? …

Really?! You were sent to kill me? They say I’m a monster? So, you *are* a vampire-hunter …

No kidding? This is your first time hunting? But they sent you to kill me. So your townspeople sent a novice to kill one of the most powerful vampires in the kingdom? Why would they do that? …

Oh? You actually volunteered for the mission?

*^((Chuckling)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Do you have a death wish or something? …

At least did you bring a weapon to do the job? …

A knife? I’m not sure if you’re familiar with vampire folklore, but traditionally a wooden stake works better. You opted to bring a knife instead? May I see the knife? …

Well, thank you for handing your weapon over to me. I assumed I’d have to take it from you …

*^((Surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Wait, this is a rubber knife! This wouldn’t penetrate pudding! You were going to kill me with this? …

It was all you had? …

Oh, you considered bringing garlic too? Of course, merely considering bringing garlic doesn’t help much, but if it’s any consolation, the whole ‘vampires hate garlic’ thing is just a myth anyway. Because of our heightened senses, some vampires just find garlic to be annoying.

So why did you opt against the garlic? …

You thought that would be way too aggressive. 

*^((Sweetly)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Well, I must say, you are by far the most polite and considerate vampire-hunter I’ve ever met …

So, let me see if I have this straight …

You decided to target me in the middle of the night, precisely when I’m *not* vulnerable. You announce your arrival by knocking on my door. You bring a rubber knife to a gunfight – worse, a fight with a vampire. And you readily hand that knife over to me. This really is your first time hunting a vampire, isn’t it?!! …

Oh, I see. They sent you to kill me, but you had a different plan? …

You just wanted to meet me. You never really believed I’m a monster? Well, I appreciate that. You are quite right. I am not. I don’t hunt for human blood. I get it from willing donors. Usually.

And of the dozens of vampire-hunters they’ve sent after me, I rarely kill any of them. I just subdue them, and then I have a teensie-weensie drink. I find even the most aggressive vampire-hunters are much more docile after they’re down a quart.

Then I turn them over to the local witch’s coven. And they turn them into darling little black cats. And those witches love and pamper their kitty cats. They are the quintessential cat-ladies. You know all those black cats, sitting on their witches’ laps, purring away? They’re all former vampire-hunters. I think they’re happier now …

*^((Chuckling)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Well, no darling, I don’t think those cats are purring sarcastically. You don’t like witches much, do you? Since I’m a vampire, it may surprise you that I don’t mind witches at all. Why, some of my best friends …

Or perhaps it’s that you don’t like cats.

You’re more of a dog person? …

*^((Sweetly)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* You are so cute. I’ve already decided I’m going to let you live. You may return to your town folks. But I was wondering if perhaps, you might want to stay and chat with me for a bit? I could brew some coffee. Then you can return home.

*^((Surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Oh, you’re worried that the townspeople won’t accept you now? You think they would hurt you, just because you failed to kill me? …

*^((Even more surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Oh my goodness! You fear they might even kill you?!!

Well, I might just have to protect you then. You could just live here with me. If they come anywhere near you, I will deal with them myself. As long as you’re with me, you are under my protection.

In fact, I could adopt you. You would be like my little boy, or my pet. You would be well-taken care of, protected, and pampered. You would just be expected to obey me. And, of course, let me have a taste of your blood every now and again.

Oh, you’re offering me your blood right now? You’re so sweet …

But you’re afraid my fangs penetrating your neck might hurt? Well, we could try your rubber knife thingy instead, if that makes you feel any better.

Actually, you needn’t worry. I am a *very* gentle vampire. Especially with such sweet little boys. I can hypnotize you into a relaxed trance. And once my venom starts working, you will enter a state of what can be described as delirious euphoria.

Now you will feel weak, dizzy and sleepy. And you might pass out. But it’s okay, because I will be holding you in my arms. You can absolutely trust me that you will wake up, safe and sound. I will never take too much. Vampires like me never lose control with our cherished, willing donors …

What’s that? You want to be a Sub? Well, I have no need for a submarine right now. I’ll let you know if that changes. Oh, I bet you meant Subscriber. But I don’t have much of a social media presence either …

*^((Surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Oh? *That’s* what Sub means? That kind of sounds like a pet …

*^((Sweetly)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Aw, you’re frightened to be my pet? Why? …

Oh, don’t worry. I wouldn’t literally turn you into a cat. Vampires don’t have that ability anyway. I’m not even thinking of turning you into a vampire. We’re a long ways from that.

Just relax, sweetie. I like you just the way you are. And, if you’re ready for feeding, let’s go ahead and do that. Sit here next to me. Get comfortable.

*^((Whispering)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* We will both find this to be a bonding experience.

*^((Speaking gently; layered sounds)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Relax. Shh. Everything is going to be okay. I’ve got you. You’re with me now. You’re safe. Allow yourself to just give in to me. Sink into my embrace. 

*^((Whispering)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Now turn your head for me.

**\[Sound of feeding\]** … …

**\[After feeding\]**

*^((Speaking gently)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Relax, sweet one. Fall asleep in my lap … 

And just know that this hapless clown act isn’t fooling anyone. There’s something quite unique about you. And I’m going to find out what it is.

Mira looked like someone who lived inside a secondhand folk tale.

A mushroom-print dress swayed around her knees, cinched by a sunflower-colored sash that didn’t match — and somehow made everything match. Her glasses were absurdly large, thick enough to qualify as armor, and scratched to the point where you weren’t sure if they amplified vision or obscured it entirely. Maybe they were a filter. Maybe she preferred it that way.

Two messy buns of red hair made her look younger than she was, but the tattoos winding down her arms told a different story — fine-line creatures from folklore, geometric sunrises, ghosts made of vines. There was a kind of lived-in conviction to how she moved, like someone who didn’t need to be seen to know she was real.

She met Romy in a stairwell that smelled like wet plaster and broken promises. Mira had been squatting on the fifth floor for two weeks already — legally, according to no one. But she had turned the hallway into a greenhouse of scavenged plants and mismatched tea mugs. The building was supposed to be condemned, but Mira called it “pre-sanctified.” Said the city had only forgotten it because it wasn’t ready to remember it yet.

She offered Romy coffee made in a repurposed moka pot balanced on a camping stove and a stack of banned zines to read while it brewed.

“You’re not broken,” she said without preamble, like she’d been waiting to say it.

Romy blinked.

“I didn’t say I was.”

“You didn’t have to. Your silence is very articulate.”

---

Mira didn’t ask for backstory. She just listened to the static in between Romy’s answers. Said she could hear frequencies that weren’t words — pain shaped like detuned piano chords.

But she never treated Romy like a problem to be solved.

Mira believed in friction. She said healing wasn’t about going back to normal. It was about learning to walk differently with the limp.

And for once, Romy didn’t feel like a glitch in someone else's program. She felt like a signal — scrambled, maybe, but coming through.

A knife? I’m not sure if you’re familiar with vampire folklore, but traditionally a wooden stake works better. You opted to bring a knife instead? May I see the knife? …

Well, thank you for handing your weapon over to me. I assumed I’d have to take it from you …

*^((Surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Wait, this is a rubber knife! This wouldn’t penetrate pudding! You were going to kill me with this? …

It was all you had? …

Oh, you considered bringing garlic too? Of course, merely considering bringing garlic doesn’t help much, but if it’s any consolation, the whole ‘vampires hate garlic’ thing is just a myth anyway. Because of our heightened senses, some vampires just find garlic to be annoying.

So why did you opt against the garlic? …

You thought that would be way too aggressive. 

*^((Sweetly)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Well, I must say, you are by far the most polite and considerate vampire-hunter I’ve ever met …

So, let me see if I have this straight …

You decided to target me in the middle of the night, precisely when I’m *not* vulnerable. You announce your arrival by knocking on my door. You bring a rubber knife to a gunfight – worse, a fight with a vampire. And you readily hand that knife over to me. This really is your first time hunting a vampire, isn’t it?!! …

Oh, I see. They sent you to kill me, but you had a different plan? …

You just wanted to meet me. You never really believed I’m a monster? Well, I appreciate that. You are quite right. I am not. I don’t hunt for human blood. I get it from willing donors. Usually.

And of the dozens of vampire-hunters they’ve sent after me, I rarely kill any of them. I just subdue them, and then I have a teensie-weensie drink. I find even the most aggressive vampire-hunters are much more docile after they’re down a quart.

Then I turn them over to the local witch’s coven. And they turn them into darling little black cats. And those witches love and pamper their kitty cats. They are the quintessential cat-ladies. You know all those black cats, sitting on their witches’ laps, purring away? They’re all former vampire-hunters. I think they’re happier now …

*^((Chuckling)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Well, no darling, I don’t think those cats are purring sarcastically. You don’t like witches much, do you? Since I’m a vampire, it may surprise you that I don’t mind witches at all. Why, some of my best friends …

Or perhaps it’s that you don’t like cats.

You’re more of a dog person? …

*^((Sweetly)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* You are so cute. I’ve already decided I’m going to let you live. You may return to your town folks. But I was wondering if perhaps, you might want to stay and chat with me for a bit? I could brew some coffee. Then you can return home.

*^((Surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Oh, you’re worried that the townspeople won’t accept you now? You think they would hurt you, just because you failed to kill me? …

*^((Even more surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Oh my goodness! You fear they might even kill you?!!

Well, I might just have to protect you then. You could just live here with me. If they come anywhere near you, I will deal with them myself. As long as you’re with me, you are under my protection.

In fact, I could adopt you. You would be like my little boy, or my pet. You would be well-taken care of, protected, and pampered. You would just be expected to obey me. And, of course, let me have a taste of your blood every now and again.

Oh, you’re offering me your blood right now? You’re so sweet …

But you’re afraid my fangs penetrating your neck might hurt? Well, we could try your rubber knife thingy instead, if that makes you feel any better.

Actually, you needn’t worry. I am a *very* gentle vampire. Especially with such sweet little boys. I can hypnotize you into a relaxed trance. And once my venom starts working, you will enter a state of what can be described as delirious euphoria.

Now you will feel weak, dizzy and sleepy. And you might pass out. But it’s okay, because I will be holding you in my arms. You can absolutely trust me that you will wake up, safe and sound. I will never take too much. Vampires like me never lose control with our cherished, willing donors …

What’s that? You want to be a Sub? Well, I have no need for a submarine right now. I’ll let you know if that changes. Oh, I bet you meant Subscriber. But I don’t have much of a social media presence either …

*^((Surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Oh? *That’s* what Sub means? That kind of sounds like a pet …

*^((Sweetly)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Aw, you’re frightened to be my pet? Why? …

Oh, don’t worry. I wouldn’t literally turn you into a cat. Vampires don’t have that ability anyway. I’m not even thinking of turning you into a vampire. We’re a long ways from that.

Just relax, sweetie. I like you just the way you are. And, if you’re ready for feeding, let’s go ahead and do that. Sit here next to me. Get comfortable.

*^((Whispering)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* We will both find this to be a bonding experience.

*^((Speaking gently; layered sounds)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Relax. Shh. Everything is going to be okay. I’ve got you. You’re with me now. You’re safe. Allow yourself to just give in to me. Sink into my embrace. 

*^((Whispering)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Now turn your head for me.

**\[Sound of feeding\]** … …

**\[After feeding\]**

*^((Speaking gently)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Relax, sweet one. Fall asleep in my lap …

I’ve been low-key annoyed by the stock dosing cup on my DF64 Gen 2 basically since day one, the arms were never particularly elegant, and even with the rubber insert it didn't jibe with me. I saw a local coffee shop struggling with the same workflow bottleneck and decided to tackle the problem.

So I finally designed + printed a little two-piece snap-together magnetic cradle that actually holds the cup rock solid using the grinder’s own vibrations to centre it. Four little magnets make the whole thing pop on/off the grinder body in like half a second, and there’s an optional center magnet version that basically glues the cup to the holder (in a good way).

Printed both versions a few months ago, and holy crap it feels so premium now. The baristas at the coffee shop are stoked. No more chasing the cup into the coldhearted arms of Turin's design team. Just slap it on, grind, pull the shot. Done. Can be done blindfolded or during a solar eclipse.

The photo in this post was of an early revision, I've since change the geometry to increase the clearance between the dosing cup and the chute.

**Synopsis:** 

You (a human vampire-hunter?) were sent to kill the powerful vampire Seraphina. But you seem too ill-prepared and incompetent to accomplish this feat. What are your true intentions? Will Seraphina spare you? Maybe even protect you? There’s something intriguing about you, fearless one.

 

**Script**

Ah, another dreary evening. How shall I entertain myself?

**\[SFX: Loud crash outside\]**

What is that commotion? I think a human is approaching. I can smell his blood from here. What is he doing here? Is he lost? Or, maybe this is yet another vampire-hunter.

**\[SFX: Knocking\]**

He’s actually knocking at my door. Most vampire-hunters don’t openly announce their arrival. Maybe he isn’t a vampire-hunter. I guess the polite thing would be to invite him in. It’s safe for vampires to invite mortals in.

**\[SFX: Sound of door opening\]**

Greetings. Are you lost, little boy? …

*^((Laughing)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* My apologies. I can see that you’re not actually a little boy. But I’m several centuries old, and quite powerful. To me, all human males are little boys …

My name’s Seraphina. And you are…? …

Well, it is nice to meet you.

And if I may say so, you seem rather lost and helpless. So what brings you to my castle, in the middle of the night? …

Really?! You were sent to kill me? They say I’m a monster? So, you *are* a vampire-hunter …

No kidding? This is your first time hunting? But they sent you to kill me. So your townspeople sent a novice to kill one of the most powerful vampires in the kingdom? Why would they do that? …

Oh? You actually volunteered for the mission?

*^((Chuckling)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Do you have a death wish or something? …

At least did you bring a weapon to do the job? …

A knife? I’m not sure if you’re familiar with vampire folklore, but traditionally a wooden stake works better. You opted to bring a knife instead? May I see the knife? …

*^((Surprised tone)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)* Wait, this is a rubber knife! This wouldn’t penetrate pudding! You were going to kill me with this? …

1qcd9hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qcd9hl/how_my_psychiatrist_ruined_my_whole_life/,how my psychiatrist ruined my whole life.,"This is the story of how a wrongly prescribed medication can so easily destroy your life. On a friend’s recommendation, I went to a psychiatrist. I didn’t have that many problems, but because I lost my dad when I was 12, I was extremely sensitive about the people I loved, and I would overreact to even the smallest thing, going into extreme panic. If they didn’t pick up the phone even once, I would instantly assume something bad had happened to them. And on top of that, I was in a turbulent and exhausting relationship with someone I was truly in love with for the first time.
I had an abnormal fear of losing him and it felt like I would die without him, so I wanted to get a bit of therapy; maybe they could prescribe one of the mildest antidepressants so I could be a bit more mentally stable. I had never used antidepressants before. But on both my mother’s and father’s side there is a heavy addiction gene. I lost my father to cocaine. My grandmother is an alcoholic. My mother may not be at the level where you’d outright call her an alcoholic, but she has a weakness for alcohol, has even received treatment for it, and once she starts, she can’t stop. My aunt and uncle are straight-up alcoholics. My doctor knew about everyone’s situation in my family. And I was a girl who had never used any drugs in her life, had never even taken an antidepressant, and only drank alcohol socially with friends, in normal amounts.
At my very first appointment, he prescribed me three different antidepressants, Ativan, and Ritalin. At 23, he diagnosed me with ADHD. I didn’t know what Ritalin was. To be honest, I didn’t know anything about meds at all. Let alone their active ingredients, their effects, what they were for I didn’t even know the names of eighty percent of them. I went to the pharmacy, got the meds, and had no idea which one was which color prescription. I just handed over the prescription and took what they gave me. Then, the next morning, I took one Ritalin when I woke up, just as my doctor had prescribed.

Later in my life, I would try almost every drug, but I will never forget what I felt the first time I took Ritalin. That first time, I finished a 1,000-piece puzzle in a single day. I was insanely joyful, I was getting an unbelievable amount of pleasure out of everything, my communication with people became incredibly fun, and most importantly, as someone with bulimia and an eating disorder, I was absolutely, absolutely never hungry. Everything was incredible.

Anyway, long story short, after a while the duration of effect of one pill started to shorten, and my mood started dropping towards the evening. When I told my doctor this, he increased it to three pills a day without questioning anything. After a while that wasn’t enough either, so he raised it to five, and after some time the duration of effect which at first had lasted all day from a single pill dropped down to an hour. It wasn’t enough, and when the effect wore off, I wasn’t my normal self. I became extremely unhappy, joyless, and restless.

And then that day came: I started crushing it and snorting it. Yes, it was more effective, but the length of time it satisfied me had shrunk so much that I wouldn’t even go out for a coffee without it. I always had to have enough spare on me. My doctor, on the other hand, didn’t notice this situation at all and every time I went, he would write however many boxes I asked for, no questions asked. I was taking a whole box of Ritalin (30 pills) in a day and a half. I wasn’t myself anymore; it was obvious from the outside too. I had wasted away; from being a curvy girl, I’d dropped to a weight that looked sickly. I didn’t even remember most events, appointments, hangouts.

I became pathologically addicted to the computer game The Sims. Because you need to fixate on something. I was doing nothing but playing Sims. I would lock onto tiny details in the game and obsess over them for hours. After a while, with my then-boyfriend also telling her how bad things had gotten, my Ritalin prescriptions were cut off. For a while, since under the influence of the meds I had basically turned into a computer genius, I kept getting it illegally off the internet. But the amount of Ritalin I was consuming was too expensive to keep buying illegally. Plus, after a while I couldn’t find it anymore. For the first time, my body was going to experience being without Ritalin.

Look, this wasn’t depression, tiredness, or just feeling down. I literally couldn’t get up; I could barely walk to the bathroom. In the end, just to feel even a tiny bit better, I turned to alcohol. And in a very short time, because I was drinking non-stop all day, I became an alcoholic.

By some coincidence, one day, just out of boredom, I crushed and snorted a pill called Wellbutrin that my friend was taking. It gave me this ten-second fake stimulant high. But at least it made me feel something, and even just the act of crushing the pill and snorting it up my nose was exciting to me.

One day I had a seizure at home. Everyone was shocked, because I don’t have epilepsy and I had never had a seizure before. An ambulance came right away, we went to the hospital, I had a bunch of CT scans, X-rays, but nothing showed up; there was no reason visible for me to have had a seizure. I didn’t think of it the first time, but after it happened two or three more times, I decided to do some research and read that excessive bupropion use can cause seizures that can be fatal. The few seconds of dopamine high it gives you is so absurd and sick when you compare it to that side effect.

I had a seizure while driving on the highway in Istanbul, and I don’t even know how many times I had them in the street. I’ve had stitches in my head; I don’t remember how many spots on my body have how many different injuries. In total, it’s definitely more than twenty. My brain had basically stopped producing its own dopamine. I lost everything, I hurt a lot of people, I made a lot of mistakes. And now I absolutely cannot enjoy life without taking something extra from outside.

And the worst part is, one day when I was chatting with an older family member who’s a pharmacist and I mentioned the doctor’s name, they said, “Everyone knows him, his nickname is ‘The Butcher.’” This doctor, because he gets commissions from pharmaceutical companies, can, without batting an eye, prescribe drugs that can destroy people’s lives, completely disregarding their lives.

As a result, now even the hardest drugs—the ones that used to get me insanely high—have no effect on me at all. There is nothing left that can get me high. I can’t enjoy anything anyway. My advice to you is: value your brain health. Once you lose it, it’s very hard to get it back.",1,1768363429.0,Vent,2,0.67,False

I am livid every time I think about it. Tom has been fighting like a madman for a week to get some accountability out of the pyromaniacs, and then some UN bureaucrat shows up and tells us to drop it.

Just like that.

The suit tells me point-blank that my access to the shelter is contingent on my signing an NDA about everything. When Tom says he's running the shelter and I get to stay as long as I need to, he's told he may be replaced as administrator unless he plays ball. And Tom, blessed man, simply looks at me and says ""It's your call, Martin.""

Just like that.

We end up signing, of course. I'd be fine with fighting until the end if it was just my ass on the line, but Thomas Sinclair makes life better for everyone here and he is not a resource worth wasting on me. I feel like crap. I've heard the conversations Tom’s had over the last couple of weeks with the Exterminators' office, with Venlil lawyers, and a District Magister. He's been passionate, and sincere. He's tried to ply them with logic, with compassion, and with shame. At all turns they've stonewalled us. And now they've run to the UN to get it swept under the rug. Bastards, bastards, bastards!

Even his promise that this isn’t the end of the fighting doesn’t help. What the hell else can we do when we’ve been forced to sign our silence?

 

A couple of days before the suit’s arrival, Tom takes my hands and looks into my eyes. He says that he understands and shares my feelings of frustrated powerlessness in the face of brutal and uncaring institutions and people. I believe him. Then he tells me what he does to feel better, and suggests I try it too.

So I've been volunteering. There's a million little things that need doing to keep a shelter running, and I've taken on every duty I'm able to. A couple of toilets are clogged? I'm on the case. Need someone to brew coffee for literally everyone? No problemo. Wouldn't it be nice if someone could bake something for the therapy groups? Consider it done, boss. Kitchen’s short-handed today? Not on my watch. Couldn't we install blackout curtains in the common rooms so we can simulate night-time? Heck, I suggested and implemented that one myself.

To my surprise it actually helps. Staying on the move makes it hard to feel sorry for myself. We're all either last survivors of our families, or far more often stuck with uncertainty for what will probably be months or even years as Earth's bureaucracy tallies the damage of the parrot freaks' genocidal tantrum. And while I'm the only one who's faced the sharp end of it, everyone's dealing with the Venlils' suspicious and hostile attitudes on top of that. I understand it's better in the big cities, but that doesn't help us out here in the boonies. Walking on eggshells, wearing the damn masks in constant sunlight, and watching every word we say and every movement we make. No wonder half of us don't bother going outside at all.

I find myself missing the kid. She was just about the only Venlil who was as cute and sweet on the inside as their entire species are on the outside. And she was better at chess than everyone at the shelter. But since last time we talked it ended with us both almost getting incinerated because her mom tried to use the Exterminators to kill me, I make the decision to not reach out to her. It's probably best if she gets to focus on school and move on.

 

Along with volunteering, I've thrown myself head-first into every other distraction I can find. I rejoin the art class, I use every part of the shelter's exercise yard or just jog circles around it until I'm dry-heaving and crying from pain, I join the shelter's theater group as a stagehand, and when a couple of guys from Germany clear out a storage room in the basement and set up an ad-hoc boxing gym, I'm first in line. I work my mind and body to exhaustion every paw, because otherwise I ruminate. Or worse, dream. Now instead I collapse into my empty bunk and blissful oblivion until breakfast call.

I left all my stuff at Vansi and Thiva's household, so it's probably ashes and slag by now. That means all I own is some clothes from the second hand bin, and a pair of music earbuds I found in the exercise yard and tried to reunite with their original owner to no success. Don't even own a charger, I have to borrow my bunkmate's. I am a little surprised that I don't really mind. I don't give myself time to sit around with a pad all day like I used to, and what else did I even own? A band shirt from when I went to see Where Angels Fear, a few bad sketches of fruit, and my dad's chess set?

Okay. That last one stings a little. So I make it a quick breakfast and head out to the yard. The last owner of the earbuds had an atrocious taste in music, but the last vestiges of their good instincts had snuck a bit of classic 2090s metal on there. Dance Under Moonlight, Godchylde, and Die by the Blade. Not my favorites, but perfectly serviceable.

Some time later, Sarah Upton finds me losing to the wall at tennis. She's doing better after the news about her family, thanks to the therapists. But it's a work in progress, and she's still got the sunken eyes of someone who cries regularly and sleeps poorly. Then again, it's a common look around the shelter. ""Hey, uh, art class is in like, ten minutes?""

I've apparently been out here for a couple of hours, since nobody’s needed me for anything today. A timepiece wouldn't go amiss. ""Thank you for letting me know. I'll clean up and join you. What are we doing today?"" Probably not a fancy pocket watch like Tom, though. Just a simple wristwatch would do. I make a note to ask around, maybe check the lost-and-found in the reception.

Sarah scrunches up her face as she thinks. Nobody in the shelter has particularly great short-term memory. Ask any of us what we ate two days ago and we'll draw a blank, like as not. Trauma just works like that. ""Uhm, I think it's still life for the first half, then a live model for the second? Don't quote me on that.""

I change out of my workout clothes and shower before donning my fancy art clothes. You can tell the difference because my art shirt has paint stains instead of pit stains. I don't actually bother to keep anything I draw, though the teacher encourages it. I also don't think I'm getting any better, but that's not the point anyway. I shuffle into the drawing room with the others, and take my usual spot. There's no assigned seating or anything, but people still gravitate toward ""their"" spot without saying anything. It's just one of the little quirks of humanity.

The still life is a few glasses of water, which is a lot trickier than it sounds. The teacher gives us some initial pointers, and explains a few things by demonstrating on the whiteboard, before she lets us loose and stalks around the room. Her glasses, angular face, and white painter's coat reminds me of some sort of bird of prey, circling the room to swoop down on the weak and unwary to offer advice and critique. The metaphor breaks down somewhat toward the end.

""Alright, that's our still lifes done for the day! For the second half, we've got a special surprise for you!""

I fold over the paper for a new one. I hear some gasps, and some people scramble to cover their faces. I silently cringe. They've been trying to get a Venlil to sit model since the shelter started, but nobody's been dumb enough to walk into the lion's den. Until now, apparently. This is going to cause trouble. They're terrified of us, and their panic instincts are overwhelmingly strong. I move to find something to cover my face, but I briefly look up and-

*What.*

""What!""

I got started before the tears had dried. I had tried to appeal to Vansi’s better nature and sense of morality for years, so that route was pointless. It was time to fight smarter, not harder. She’d soon find out she wasn’t the only one who could be a sneaky liar. Vansi turned from me to head inside the house as soon as the Exterminator van had left line of sight, and I spoke up with a sobbing whimper. ""M-Mom? I don't wanna go back in the house. Martin, th-the human, it was... Could we... could we take into a hotel tonight instead? Next paw, after work and school, we can go and clean its things out... Please?""

She acquiesced, with some reluctance. ""Of course, sweetie. This paw's been intense for us both, and I think a little time away will do us good."" The hotel was a bit closer to both her job and my schooling than home, but that wasn't the important part. I heard what Martin had said in passing about a box, and I know Vansi did too. As soon as she got home, she'd look for it. Besides, I couldn’t leave Martin hanging. I’d have dashed off right away, but staying in Vansi’s good graces for a while longer was still in our best interests. She wasn’t above having me dragged off to assessment for Predator Disease if I didn’t play this right.

Once at the Greenmeadow Hotel, I waited as short a time as I felt I could before speaking up. “H-Hey mom, I… I need to talk to Vilek about this… she promised I’d tell her if anything happened with the predator… I’ll come back in a quarter claw at most, okay?” I lied to her face, but it was important that she didn’t get to start on damage control before me. The second I was out of line of sight I’d make a straight line for the Exterminators’ offices and get my human released.

\---

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 29th, 2136*

\---

Unfortunately I didn’t have time to talk to Martin if I wanted to keep to the schedule I promised Vansi, but mister Sinclair promised to relay my well-wishes. (I desperately wanted to see him, but right now keeping Vansi from getting suspicious was too important). The next morning I left the hotel for the university as Vansi left for work, and hugged her goodbye in the hotel lobby before parting ways. ""Have a great claw at work, mom, I love you!""

""You too, sweetie, I'll see you at home!""

Once we parted ways, I set out at top speed. As soon as I got to university grounds, I immediately found Vilek and dragged her into a corner. She was naturally startled to be taken aside so suddenly. ""Thiva! Why’re you..."" she began, but I cut her off.

""No time. I need you to take my pad and go around with it at school for the claw. And... I kinda need to borrow your cash card.""

She blinked and flicked her ear in surprise. ""What? Why?!""

I gave her my cutest look (and I can do some very good ones!) ""Because we're best friends?""

She sighed adorably. ""...You're not going to do anything crazy with it, are you?""

""I promise that I will personally reimburse every last bit of the money, and it won't be much anyway.""

""Why can't you use your own card?""

""Because mom tracks my purchases.""

She flicked her tail in a motion of understanding, and agreement. ""Let's just swap pads, that's easiest.""

""Thanks, Vilek, you're the best! Oh, one more thing, remember how we were looking into splitting that place nearby?""

""Yeah?""

""...well, I think we should see if it's still available. In the next couple paws would be good.""

Her ears sprung up in surprise. ""The next- Thiva, that's way too soon! What is going on?!""

""I promise I'll explain everything later, okay? But I don't have time right now!"" I gave her my warmest hug and folded my tail around hers in a fond and intimate display, before rushing out to catch the first bus.

 

I purchased a bundle of random cloths and textiles from the shopping district, then turned right around and headed home again. This was the danger point. Step one: Vansi's car wasn't there. Step two: I snuck in through the window to my room, just in case. Step three: Moving as quietly as if an Arxur was sniffing for prey downstairs (and between one and Vansi I'm not sure which I'd have preferred!), I headed down to the living room. Once I was sure Vansi wasn't anywhere, I grabbed the chess set and its pieces and folded it around them, before heading back up to Renak's room.

Martin's clothes and effects were strewn through the room, but there was a system to it. Kind of. He had designated a spot as a pile for his clothes, he had a couple of books on the desk, and his pad was on the bed. I stuffed everything I could find into his traveling bag and fumbled the zipper shut.

Next, I had to find Renak’s box.

That part wasn't as hard as I had feared. Under the desk a bit of the floor had been cut out. Martin hadn't bothered to cover it back up again. The small space there seemed to be Renak's hidey-hole. I found a small kitchen knife, a pair of pliers, some standard nail clippers, and a metal box with a lock. The lock had been opened already, and the box rattled like it was full of tiny pebbles when I handled it. Swallowing my fear, I opened it.

Inside, there were several stacks of uneven sheets of paper, all yellowed and old. Shaking the box a bit, I found that underneath them there were dozens of little stones in whites, greys, and blacks. The black stones were curved, while the white and grey ones were straight. I lifted the stacks of paper, and found the bottom of the stack to be unexpectedly soft. (And I kinda dropped them with an undignified squeak, but nobody was around so it doesn't count!)

The underside of each sheet was covered in either fur or colorful feathers. I inspected them, trying to figure out what was so bad about this. If nobody ever listened to me when I told them about Renak's ""playing rough"" with me as a kid, I just didn't see how these things would convince anyone. Until I saw that one of the sheets had a flattened and boneless little rodent face attached to it.

*Oh sacred Protector!!*

 

Skin! They weren't papers at all, they were pieces of skin! With horror and disgust, I realized that my brother had kept a box full of the skins of rodents and birds! And the ""rocks"" were teeth, claws, and talons!

Retching and holding back the urge to vomit, I shoved the pack of animal hides back into the box. I used Vilek's pad to take a few pictures for documentation, and then carefully shut the box and put it back under the desk along with the tools, and covered it all up.

A small part of me considered showing Vansi. But the rest of me knew what she'd do if I did: Blame someone else. Probably the predator that had lived in the room. Nothing was ever Renak’s fault. But sitting around being angry about it wouldn’t help. It was time for me to try and set this aside, and proceed with the next step of my plan. I took some time to compose myself from my discovery, before I opened up Vilek's pad and sent a message to... well to myself, asking to meet up at my place. She said she'd feign sickness to cut class and be right over. (Did I mention she's my best friend?)

 

By the time my bestie showed up, I had piled the textiles outside the house, and had already handed off Martin's bag to a same-paw delivery service to drop off at her place. I wagged my tail happily to see her. ""Here, quick, help me burn this!""

Her tail-tip flicked uncertainly, and rather than help me douse the textiles with fuel she swapped our pads back. ""Uhh, what is it?""

""It's a bunch of random textiles I bought.""

""Okay, but... why?""

""Because mom tried to have Martin killed. Like... she called the Exterminators on him, then lied to them so they'd kill him.""

She turned her head with alarm. ""Wait, Martin the human?! What did it do?!""

I flicked my tail angrily. ""Oh don't you start, he didn't do anything! He said Exterminators were assholes, and she proceeded to call them over to prove him right!""

She slowly swished her tail and folded her ears down to signal appeasement. ""Okay, but... what's that got to do with your backyard bonfire?""

""Because if mom comes home to me having already burned all his stuff, she won't do it.""

""But it's not- Oh!"" Her ears shot up with realization.

""Yeah, now you get it. But that's not all, listen to what I found in Renak's room...""

\---

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 15th, 2136*

\---

Once I convinced Vansi that I just felt so awful about having had that predator in the house that I simply had to get rid of its stuff, it wasn't hard to take the next step and suggest that I move somewhere closer to the university with Vilek. She wasn't sure about it, until I pointed out that it'd let me take a part-claw job and send her some money, which was the entire reason we took in the human to begin with. (Actually finding that job's a problem for Future Thiva!)

I checked for the box on the paw of the move, but it was already gone.

Then once I had moved out and gotten settled in with Vilek, all I had to do was volunteer to be painted at the human shelter. I could have just showed up, but I wanted a little more of a dramatic flair! And if that meant waiting a couple of extra paws for the reunion, so be it.

The look on my human's face was totally worth the prep, and even walking into a room full of predators! I triumphantly held his travel pack aloft before his shocked, gaping expression with a joyful giggle.

""Hey Martin! You forgot your stuff!""

**December 10, 2009**

Today, I moved into a new town to fill in the newly developed EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) manager position. Apparently, the neighboring city's and towns are complaining that high levels of unknown waste was being found in their water reservoirs, and that the source was coming from this very town. The town government decided that it would establish a EHS program to subdue the neighboring towns from complaining anymore. Given that the pay for this position was a decent amount I decided to apply; low and behold I got the job lucky me I guess. The town is quit beautiful despise its possible environmental waste problems. Lush green Fox-tail grass and rolling hills for as long as the eye can see, and a long flowing river.

\*The river I have to test later for any foreign matter\*

I would like to explore the town and it’s surrounding environment more, but I have to see my new office soon at the town hall.

\*while driving into the center of the town I can see the town hall placard (Aethlegrass Town Hall).\*

Quit the grandiose building for such a small town, maybe this is why they can establish an EHS program so quickly. The parking like any other government building is horrible no space for anyone to park despite how large the parking lot is. As I walk into the building I see the receptionist on the phone, so I wave to her to show that I would like to speak to her.

“Hello sir, How may I help you?”

“Hello Miss?”

“Oh dear me, My name is Briella Lark.”

“Its a pleasure to meet you Miss Lark. I’m the new EHS manager that was assigned here today. Do you by any chance know where my office would be?”

“Oh, Yes Mr. Davies. Your office is in the South wing of the building. If you go out to the central plaza, and turn towards the large tree you’ll see behind it a door marked “South Wing” when you open it the hallway will lead you down to your office.”

“Okay, behind the tree, through the door, and down the hallway. Thank you very much Miss Lark.”

My goodness that lady can talk a lot, but she seemed to be kind. Hmm... Pass the tree, though the door, down the hallway? This should be my office then? Lets see. Lets see.

\*Opens door slowly\*

“?”

“Wow, I guess someone plan a little welcome.”

\*Looks at the two green balloons in the office tied to the name plate on the desk (John Davies EHS Manager).\*

The office is small and cozy. The office desk has a welcome letter next to the name plate.

\-Dear Mr. Davies, Welcome to the Aethlegrass family we wish you a warm say, and hope to see you soon. Signed the whole Team.-

That was quit nice of them to do. Though I wish they had closed the window when they had left, There’s leaf's and grass all over the floor and window seal. Seems, like the first thing for me to do today is to set up my office and clean up a little bit.

\*Turns on Radio\*

\-White girl music starts playing-

Man this song is good. Hmm... Hmm.. “Starin' blankly ahead

Just makin' my way ... And I need you And I miss you”

“Wow, nice sing there bud.”

\*I jolt my head up not expecting someone to overhear me singing.\*

“Oh, hello there I... I didn’t see you there... How long where you there?”

“Not long just enough to see that you definitely grew up watching The Wayans Bros.

\*Stranger Starts to laugh a little.\*

“Hmm.. Ya I did. So, who are you weirdo?”

\*clears throat\*

“Sorry, I’m Kevin Milton. I’m your office neighbor; right across the hallway buddy.”

\*Kevin grabs, and covers my whole hand to shake it?\*

“ I see.. Well, its nice to me you, but I better finish cleaning so I can leave on time to finish my first day right.”

“Ya, okay Terry, Later.”

Well, that was a weird way to end my first day, but it could’ve been worst.

**December 11, 2009**

Hmm... Today I have to go test the rivers water for an contaminants so, it would probability be best to leave as early as possible today. 

\*Poring coffee in to a mug.\*

“Man I hope to day doesn’t involve me having to talk to a lot of people today.” 

\-Standing still while looking up with my eyes closed rubbing the bridge of my nose-

Despite working as a manager for long time I still dread having to do “small talk” to not look rude in front of people, even if I don’t want to talk to them I still have to act professional.

\-I take a deep breath.-

“Alright, lets go!”

\*I open the door and step on a small pile of twigs and grass.\*

I hate my life. I haven’t even made it to my car, and I have to clean up someone else mess already. I’ll just clean that up when I get back from work.

\-Gets into car and starts driving.-

Well at least theirs no traffic here. Hmm...

\*Notices a lot of people on the grassy hills.\*

I guess the people in this town like hiking? Well there probably isn’t much else to do here. Looks nice though.

\-5 minutes later-

\-arrives at the office parking lot-

Why it there no parking in a freaking rural town-hall parking lot! Like seriously who else is here?

\*Spends 10 minutes looking for a parking space.\*

“Finally! A spot.”

“Okay, lets see... Lets see... Test tubes, stripes, pH meter, and note book.”

I think that’s all that I need from by office to get some environmental samples from the river for today. Afterwards, I have to go to the water sanitation plant to get more samples. Hmm.... And that’s probability all the field data that I need to collect for today.

\*Entering my office\*

\-Hair on the back of neck goes stiff.-

“Eeh... What the heck was that?”

\*Looks around to see if anyone's around me?\*

What-ever probability just the coffee giving me the hebe-jibes. I just need to get my equipment and leave get the samples, so I can test the water.

1qcd5ux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qcd5ux,Awkward Apartment Layout!,"Moving into a beautiful, stunning building with sweeping Hollywood views, but an incredibly awkward apartment layout. The unit is just under 1100 square feet, but consists of one large living area that has a kitchen along an entire wall, with the fridge at the very end closest to the window. There's a small nook towards the back seemingly for a desk or a dining area. 

My biggest thing is how to make the living room feel distinct from the kitchen, despite being one space and incredibly difficult here because the fridge is kind of at the opposite end of where it should be, as the living area should clearly be closest to the windows. 

My initial thought is to split it down the middle lengthwise, with the couch perpendicular to the windows creating a divider, but I don't quite know where the island would go.

1qcd584,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1qcd584/new_to_this_seems_to_be_escalating_quickly_feel/,"New to this, seems to be escalating quickly, feel like I never got to say goodbye","I've been lurking for a few months and need to get this out. It's long. We're in Canada. BPSO and I have been together a long time, love him to bits. Things were always dynamic but I like dynamic people so I never thought anything of it. I have audhd (found out last year), pmdd, and am on disability for physical stuff. I know I'm a challenge to be with too. From day one he never stressed about it, it was always take care of yourself and don't worry I'll work. Rest all you need. Always so full of love, still is. We're best friends and each other's main sounding boards. 

Over the years cyclical problems escalated that were the most obvious in the winter. The yearly big blow up and threats to leave, furniture damaged. Some instances he was asked to stay elsewhere for a few days while I cleared my head. Everything would resolve itself and we'd go on our merry way, but the residue of all the conflicts has built up in me. Then conflicts started becoming more obvious in the fall, then spring and fall. 

A whopper happened a few years ago where I found out about 2 years worth of hidden sexual misbehavior and debt. Not the first time, but definitely the worst time. That was my line in the sand, get serious help or I need to go for my own sake. Our family doctor started him on a variety of tried and failed antidepressants over 2 years, voila turbo mania that came to a head with rage and psychosis and hotel jumping for a few weeks, while blaming it all on me. We had a problem at my hands earlier in the year, where my addiction made me blow up and say awful things. I started a program to address my addiction and I had thought we were working through it well when it all went sideways, then to hotels. He'd never tell me where he was, but it was all my fault. Sometimes I didn't hear from him for a few days. This was very unlike anything in our past. 

We've done years and years of couples therapy, individual therapy, etc. He was referred for deeper help a few times but wasn't honest, so he didn't get the help. He says now that when he's in a phase, ""it"" won't let him get help. I believe that, because I see it now. When I can tell something is wrong, whether emotionally or like something is being hidden, and I bring it up, ""it"" comes at me like a freight train with all the DARVO, gaslighting, and passive aggressive hurls you can think of. Whether he's hiding debt, texts, or simply ""it"" doesn't want him to be honest about how he's doing (anything deep, really), it's coming for me and it's all my fault. He also loses the ability to get real or have deep conversations, it all stays superficial bro shop style. Performative. 

After the hotels incident our family doctor put him on an AP to try to help stabilize him and ""treat the agitation"" while referring him to the ever hopeless CMHA. It was like packing a gunshot wound with gauze waiting until his psych evaluation which we paid partially out of pocket to get faster than the 2 year community waitlist. The system has become so broken here. The evaluation said BP1 and to increase the med dose. Leading up to that appt I watched him flip through a lot of episodes, either rapid switching or mixed. Ever since the diagnosis, he's been crashing and now I think he's gone into a really good mixed episode because he's very black hole depressed but the manic black eyes are also there. 

Earlier last year I noticed his eyes change when he's hypo/manic, so I've been using this help guide me on where he's at. He agreed to let me do a photo journal where I take a quick head shot daily (which I haven't remembered as I'd like) so that I can hopefully show him the changes I see. 

Recently I brought up some concerns I had with his lacking self care and how it would likely help in some way to do xyz instead, all based on the experiences of the relevant sub here (and thank heavens for it). Explosion. My fault, how dare I, nothing he does is good enough, he only found out recently, if I don't like it then let's split, I don't have to stay with him through this, I expect him to be perfect. It got too intense for me, so I said so, and that I'd like to talk another time when he's calmer. Then ""it"" got really mad and he told me he's leaving and will be back tomorrow (he's supposed to sleep, night shifts), he doesn't even want to look at me, then grabbed his music equipment and stormed off staying he was going to go spiral somewhere (pawn his equipment for money for weed). He came back in from the car soon after, put his stuff back, quickly apologized (in what seemed like a sincere and exasperated way) then sat downstairs by the door with his head in his hands. He stayed like this for at least an hour. I wouldn't talk to him anymore, I left to go cry to a friend over coffee. He thankfully put himself to bed before I got home. When he got up for work I froze and couldn't talk to him or really look, he prepped his things for the night and left. I'm stuck at the apology not being enough anymore. I know he's trying and going through so much, but still. 

He is med complaint with what he's currently on, so far. He's very upset that he has to live with how tired it makes him feel and all the things he has to give up. I can only imagine the unravelling of his life he's doing in his mind now knowing this diagnosis. He's told me about a lot of spiralling about how he's messed up all our lives etc. I know it sits heavy for him wondering if either of our kids will have it. I'm sure he is grieving the loss of the life and future he thought he'd be able to have. Financially he's toast for at least the next 5 years on a consumer proposal. We are a single income family, I'm on disability. If he manias and wants money and nobody will lend it to him, I know he'll turn to crime, he did in his youth. The psych told him to write a letter outlining everything and giving me permission to handle his business so that if he gets into it with police I can arrive with the letter and hopefully they'll take him to the hospital. Problem is knowing him, he will fight like hell and get himself shot or tazed, he hates police. The psych said to get an airtag for the car in a spot only known to me so that if he disappears in another mania or psychosis, I can track him (or the car) down. But ""it"" won't let him get help, and the car is in his name, so I'm not sure what that would solve. 

I do not like that he weaponized his diagnosis to hurt me. I do not like that he won't admit he needs to go to the hospital. I do not like that I have to choose to be alone for my well-being (we have 2 preteen kids, so I have to be ok) knowing full well I'm setting him up to fail. I fully believe the only reason he does anything to look after himself is because I tell him he should, or to get me off his back. And yet, even with all this tormenting him, if I went into a flare and needed to sleep a ton, he wouldn't hesitate to say ok babe go lie down I'll handle the kids. 

I feel like ever since those antidepressants, it's escalated so damn quickly now and I'm losing him. I feel like I never got to say goodbye or enjoy my time with him better before he started fading. I'm so sad that I'm watching him slowly lose it, and I'm so sad knowing that I'll have to eventually separate, and leave him to fend for himself when he can't. I fear he'd be homeless in a few years. I feel robbed of him and it's sitting so heavy. 

I'm almost halfway through my Master's and I've reached out to admin to apply for taking a leave of absence. Regardless of whether we stay together or not, I really need rest. My brain is fried from the forensic accounting, decoding, and stress. I struggle to compose original work, my creativity is gone, I just want to stare at walls and out windows. I need rest so I can be there for the kids and him, until I can't be there for him. I wish that to be later than sooner, but with how that recent talk came back at me, I really feel like we're on borrowed time. How did someone so amazing get this and still stay amazing right to the bitter end? It's so fucking tragic. I don't know where the line is but I don't want it to be here yet.

1qcd3rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qcd3rn/romance/,Romance?,"Hey all. I'm wondering if you can give me some advice. I've been married to my husband for nearly 8 years and we've been together since I was 17 years old. I love him and our relationship is very solid. He's been my best friend for a long time. 

The one thing we struggle with most is my desire for romance. I can absolutely acknowledge my lack of experience with dating  and my love of romance novels probably doesn't help my perception on this topic. However, I really would like more intentional romance from my husband. 

To give him credit, he does show me he loves me in lots of ways. He'll bring me coffee or food when I don't want to get up from reading, he's super physically affectionate, etc. This is just not one he's super comfortable with. This is in part because as a person with ASD he is very introverted, hyper fixated on his current hobbies, and hates restaurants. I just want to feel loved in this specific way, or get more words of affirmation about things besides my appearance. 

I feel like I've communicated this need many times, done what I can to help with planning (not his strength) by buying a ""date ideas"" book full of easy, creative, non-restaurant related date ideas to do once a month, and have worked on growing in the areas that I needed to for our relationship (like sex). I don't know that I've really seen this same sustained effort from him. 

I also don't want to force romance, because then it doesn't really send the intended message, right? And I don't really want to add more to my mental load.

Not sure how to deal with this in a way that's fair for both of us. Would love your advice!

I graduated in early December. I did not look at a single nursing thing until a few days into the new year. I needed to finally see my family and enjoy the holidays. 

Got my ATT on the 6th of January and scheduled for the first available I saw then for the 22nd. Prep-wise I did some of the simple nursing stuff (paid subscription I had since starting school). It honestly wasn't great and I found at least two questions with glaring errors. But it was still practice. I listened to a few Mark K lectures while driving.  Meanwhile I kept checking to see if I could get an earlier date. Then two days ago I saw one for today 1/13, and jumped on it. That day I finally figured out how to get into a practice CAT exam in ATI and did one of those. Yesterday I skipped ahead and listened to lecture 12, prioritization and delegation. That's it. Maybe 350 practice questions total and almost zero content review. 

Today, test day: Dropped my kid off at school, took myself to get a crepe and coffee for breakfast.  Went home, played video games, had a snack and left for the exam.

Check in at the testing center was a breeze and I waa surprised to learn I could start right away (more than 30 min early). 

The beginning was harder than I expected.  I went slowly. Then I started getting more SATA and case studies. I believe I had six (6) question case studies. Several SATAs. No bowties.  Many of those where there are a few columns and rows and you have to click the bubbles for which S/S fits each disorder. No more than 15 stand alone questions. I will say while I was surprised at how many case studies I got, it was kind of nice because by the end of them the disorder is revealed so I know I answered the prior questions correctly. 

I took one break about an hour in for water and chapstick cuz those crazies don't even let you keep that.  Took about 1 hr 45 min total. Shut off at 85. There was a lot I knew on it but plenty I didn't. Still, I'm confident I passed. 

Advice-don't get worked up over this thing. Did you do well in school? Stop trying to learn or review content.  Spend a week learning how to the the test.  What to do when you feel stuck on a question. What the NCLEX is looking for. Schedule it as soon as you can and take the damn thing. Think about how much you learned in school. A tiny fraction will be on this exam. You could spend a month on content and still not see any of it on the test. You know what you know. And remember, over the past few years approximately 90% of people pass the first time. Unless you genuinely think you might be in the bottom tenth...stop stressing, you got this.",10,1768362648.0,PassNclex,3,1.0,False

1qccyga,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1qccyga/ca_a_local_emergency_vet_turned_away_my_dying_dog/,"[CA] A local ""Emergency"" Vet turned away my dying dog for a ""6:00 cutoff."" Now they are threatening to sue me for my Google Review.","
Location: Los Angeles 


I’m posting this because I need advice, but also to warn other pet owners.
Last week, my dog, Nova, was dying of suspected rat poisoning. I was referred to this  local emergency vet clinic by a local nonprofit. Their website says they are open until Midnight and they advertise ""Walk-in Emergency Services.""
I called at 5:25 PM. The staff told me they ""stopped taking animals at 6:00."" They refused to even triage her. My dog died in my arms.
I left a factual Google review about my experience. Today, I received a Cease and Desist letter from there lawyer (who appears to be related to the clinic directors).
The ""Shady"" parts:
• The Name: They couldn't even bother to spell my name correctly in the legal letter.
• The ""Hiding"" of Evidence: I asked for the call recordings from 5 PM. They admitted they exist but ""denied"" my request to hear them, claiming it was ""unilateral.""
• The Lie: The lawyer’s letter claims they were ""at capacity,"" but the staff specifically told me it was a ""6:00 cutoff""—which is weird because they advertise being open until Midnight.
• The Threat: They gave me 5 days to ""grieve"" before demanding I delete my review or face ""court process.""
My Questions:
1. In California, can a vet clinic advertise as an ""Emergency"" facility open until Midnight but have a secret 6:00 PM cutoff for life-threatening cases?
2. Is this a SLAPP suit? I’m telling the truth and I have the call logs to prove the 5:00 PM timestamps.
3. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of specific clinic or these ""lawyer-owner"" tactics?

We did an autopsy. She died of rat poisoning. This is a treatable emergency. If they had spent 5 minutes triaging her when I called at 5:25, she could have been saved with Vitamin K1 and fluids. Instead, they let her die because of a ""time clock."" 

• They claim they were ""at capacity,"" but the phone staff specifically cited the ""6:00 cutoff.""
• They admitted they have the call recordings but refuse to release them to me.
• They gave me 5 days to ""grieve"" before they sue me for defamation.

I am NOT removing the review. I am filing a complaint with the California Veterinary Medical Board tomorrow and letting the nonprofit that referred me know how their ""partner"" is treating people.

Update: The clinic’s lawyer (who appears to be related to the owner) has sent me a formal Cease & Desist threatening to sue me for 'Defamation Per Se' unless I delete my review within 5 days. They claim my account is false, but they are simultaneously refusing to release the 5:25 PM phone recordings that would prove exactly what was said. I am not being silenced. I am standing by the truth of what happened to puppy Nova.

People post reviews every day about bad coffee or slow food, and businesses just move on. Why is this clinic spending money on a lawyer and sending misspelled threats to shut down a review about my dying dog and how they refused us over 5 minutes ?

There are multiple reviews on their own pages and across the web claiming they provide 'walk-in emergency care' until Midnight. If they are proud of their work, why are they so desperate to hide the fact that they turned away a poisoned dog at 6 PM? It feels like they are more worried about their Google rating than the lives they claim to save.


This is the review that they are threatening me over:

“I am writing this with a shattered heart.
Yesterday, my dog Nova-whom I have raised since she was 8 weeks old-collapsed in hypothermic shock. She was freezing and dying.
I called this hospital at 5:25 PM. I begged and pleaded with them to see her. Because I was calling from Compton and had to rely on an Uber, I told them I wouldn't arrive until 6:05 PM.
They told me they stop taking animals at 6:00.
I begged them for those five minutes. I begged them to save her life. They refused.
They chose a 5-minute head start on their evening over the life of a dog who had been my world for years. Because they wouldn't wait 300 seconds, Nova ended up passing away in my arms on my kitchen floor. She deserved a doctor; she only had me.
To the management: You have forgotten your oath. You care more about your closing time and your deposits than the animals you claim to serve. Your lack of compassion is a disgrace. May my puppy rest in peace, no thanks to you”


TL;DR: Vet turned away a poisoned dog 5 minutes after a secret ""cutoff"" (6 hours before closing). Now they are using a lawyer with the same last name as the owner to bully me into deleting my review.",137,1768362539.0,legaladvice,34,0.88,False

Would it be too much of an adjustment to expect friends to hang out this way vs being on couches? I would have cushions and things for back support to make it easier for people who dont usually sit on the floor. As well as chairs across from this platform zone.

Okay so the starting question am I in the wrong for leaving my boyfriend / baby daddy of 6 years to our youngest child?

So here's the context...  Geez I'm so used to reading everybody else's I didn't think this would be me typing one of these lmao, but here we are. So I'm 27, hes 29. We've been together for 6 years this coming May 2026. We've had a lot happen in our relationship..  this is about be long. But it's important for the context and full picture... Also please know I will be putting both of our mess ups, and this is not for the sole purpose of ridiculing him so no hate at either of us- this is solely for advice from people who are on the outside looking in so that I can stop feeling like I'm in this hell of turmoil. 

ALRIGHT, continuing.. 

As stated we've been through a lot in our relationship. When we first started, we started as friends with benefits and I already had one child before him from someone I dated in high school. When we first started as friends with benefits, we both were just not ready for a relationship, but we got to know each other and liked each other enough to just be willing to open up to something like that. Eventually I was going to start moving on from him because he did State before that he was not really looking for someone with a child being that's a lot of responsibility. Which it is; choosing to get into a serious relationship with someone who has a child prior to you is a big decision. You're choosing to be another figure in this child's life, you're going to be sharing a home with this child, and helping raise this child- that's just the reality of it.  So anyway realizing I was catching feelings I was going to start to let him go, to then which he admitted that he had feelings for me. We started off fine, but eventually it got to a point where I had to start asking him to stop liking other girls pictures that are half naked.. along with him to stop following pages like that, he also had a serious p\*\*n addiction- which not only did I not like but was causing issues in our sex life. At first I asked kindly over and over and over..  until I started getting fed up and it was causing real s\*\*\* arguments to the point that I was really about to leave. When he saw that I was seriously about to leave he promised he was going to work on things and stop doing what he was doing that he genuinely didn't want to lose me, yada yada. . Even though there were times that I would find hidden things eventually he stopped. Over time I started yearning for more affection from him, he never complimented me.. hell barely liked my own things but could be liking half naked pictures... Anyway continuing.. . Started mentioning these things and of course it was another begging  and arguing game... During the whole  arguing for the affection, compliments, along with dates- I started to look and other places for what I wasn't getting at home. It wasn't intentional, but I sure was flattered when a man would call me beautiful, so pretty, noticed a different makeup look I did, noticed when I did my hair different, or some kind of new accessory... I've exchanged numbers with coworkers before, mainly because they all had each other's numbers and never was a big deal to me. I'm more sociable, he's definitely not. A few male co-workers  casually hit me up asking about work or ranting about it, I had one that felt comfortable enough to spill more personal things going on in his life- like knocking some random girl up and he didn't really know what to do. Things never escalated past that. There was one man who I met, that we became work besties. All was in good fun no lines were crossed.  (I also want to note that he knew this about me, and was honest to him since the beginning that I was a very sociable person- none of this was hidden)  Eventually with this man he started just casually buying me things like coffee, little breakfast stuff to bring to our work- I definitely enjoyed some of the attention but never thought past it.  Where it started becoming a problem was when he was talking my ear about the relationship of my partner and I. Like why hasn't he put a ring on my finger yet when you're about to have his child, you know he's always looking at other girls, and more. This coworker of mine and I would go shopping together and go to Starbucks every once and a while too. My partner did Express how he was becoming weary of us getting together like that before work or on a board day off. Which understandable so I backed off some, but everything that was spoken to my ear made me a little more annoyed with my partner. Because to me it felt true.. so I didn't cut my coworker all the way off because of that.  Eventually though everything stopped, after I went to a club with him on a angry night with my partner and got left there because my coworker thought I left with another dude when I just went out to the side to smoke. It was a whole unnecessary 💩 show. Everything sort of started going back to normal between my partner and I, I calmed down with all the get back and hurt you mess because you hurt me ordeal.. but the dates and all that crap still barely happened. So I got to the point of once he falls back again I'm not going to ask for anything anymore, I'm just going to leave. Sure enough it happened again, so in February 2025, an old high school buddy hit me up and asked if I wanted to get some food and catch up. I then decided it was over between my partner and I. I came back told him we were done. After a while of course he wanted to show he was different, that this was going to work.. I stayed at his house this whole time mainly because I didn't want to go back to living with my mom with my two kids and two dogs. She's already got my stepdad over there with dementia and my uncle with mental disabilities that she takes care of. It was just going to be too much.. overtime my partner kept showing this ""different"" side of him. Him and I agreed his time of him pursuing me would be a talking stage. I told him out right I would talk to other people.. never met up with anyone, just chatted to entertain myself and kill time per say. After a while he started talking about getting a house and trading in the current one we were in. I started looking at homes with him, entertain the idea, but did tell him I didn't want the house to have my name on it in case I 100% decided I didn't want to give another chance. The house would be on his dad's property, it would just be a mess and we're not even married or engaged was my thought process.. he didn't stop putting in all this effort that he was doing, helping with my oldest who isn't his, showing affection... But I was still a bit eh to the affection thing and compliments because it all was begged for... While maybe I should have welcomed the change, I just held too much resentment for how long everything took. I was drained, emotionally tired, I didn't know what to really do. I couldn't say I didn't love him, but I did feel as though my feelings for him had changed some way. I wanted my youngest to have her dad in the house, and my oldest to have this father figure when her own father barely does anything as it is... This was a big decision for me to make. So moving on... I haven't talked or entertained anyone for a good few months now. I started to lean more towards on focusing on this new house and possibly this being a clean slate to everything once it got there. BUT THEN... I was on my video game, I used his phone to look up how to get past the spot I was stuck in, since my phone was being used by my youngest. She was already in a mood and didn't want to make it worse from her being sickly.. using his phone a notification popped up that so and so that you interacted with is blah blah blah. So my mind immediately was like oh?? Couldn't help but click, and of course there were some chats.. while there was nothing inappropriate but some ""what's up"", ""how are you doing""- eventually he gave her his Snapchat. She never added him and then stop replying to him.  All this in the beginning of December, up until Christmas Lololololol. Not going to lie my heart sunk, because in my head I'm like wow, you're trying to prove all this and this to me while there's a whole house coming, and you're doing this...  Eventually it got brought up, but I had already decided I was leaving the very next day. His excuse was that I was giving mixed signals, at some points I mentioned maybe he should just find himself only a house that he could afford alone.  I did mention that a few times, I had stopped mentioning it because again like I said, I started leaning towards the house and all this supposed work that he's put into me, it was starting to feel like a fresh clean slate. He was told before that if he talks to anyone else to just let me know. He said he chatted with her just to get his mind off of what was going on between him and I, and while it was nice for a little- he didn't care that she didn't reply because things seemed better between him and I. Supposedly while they chatted all he could think about was still me lolololololol. He said he wasn't sure if I was still talking to people or if I was entertaining the guy I had went to lunch with still.. I told him all he had to do was ask if I was still talking to other people or entertaining anyone and he would have known. His other reasoning that he also mentioned was that if I had decided to leave him, at least he would have had someone to continue chatting with, possibly build a friendship with, and that whatever happened from there happened. LOLOL. I have most of my things and my kids things. .. I have one of my dogs with me.. I don't know, while I can see I was giving confused mixed signals, I feel like it doesn't excuse the fact that he could have talked to me the way he always States that I should just talk to him... If this was a fresh slate it should have been in his mind to do so but instead he was all too giddy enough to chat with a pretty girl on tiktok LOL. 

I just need to know what others think looking from the outside in... My stomach hurts, sometimes I feel like going back, I wasn't a saint myself, but is this even worth saving?  

We had a lot of good times together and with family, I saw changes- but all felt hella forced.. he claims he's happy with the person he's turned into, that he doesn't feel forced... Stated he enjoys being a family man, family vacations, small get together with the family...

A few days at my moms, has also shown how much he's helped with the kids/animals and did take a big load off. Not saying my mom doesn't help, but she's older, has two other people now she cares for. She can only do so much..  but anyway..  advice? What do you think? ",1,1768362371.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I was wondering if anyone with MVP developed a sudden sensitivity to caffeine. My MVP is mild. I noticed my palpitations becoming more frequent early last Fall when I had caffeine or alcohol. I cut out alcohol and try to avoid products with caffeine. I used to be able to have caffeine with little issues. 

Last week, I took Excedrin for a migraine and I also had my coffee (mushroom blend with a little bit of caffeine). I had frequent skipped heartbeats off and on all day last Thursday, and I developed slight chest pain along with a little bit of lightheadedness and tingling in my left arm later in the afternoon. I wound up going to the ER just to get everything checked out and all was good.

Just curious if anyone has experienced something similar (sudden sensitivity to something affecting your heart).

Mira looked like someone who lived inside a secondhand folk tale.

A mushroom-print dress swayed around her knees, cinched by a sunflower-colored sash that didn’t match — and somehow made everything match. Her glasses were absurdly large, thick enough to qualify as armor, and scratched to the point where you weren’t sure if they amplified vision or obscured it entirely. Maybe they were a filter. Maybe she preferred it that way.

Two messy buns of red hair made her look younger than she was, but the tattoos winding down her arms told a different story — fine-line creatures from folklore, geometric sunrises, ghosts made of vines. There was a kind of lived-in conviction to how she moved, like someone who didn’t need to be seen to know she was real.

She met Romy in a stairwell that smelled like wet plaster and broken promises. Mira had been squatting on the fifth floor for two weeks already — legally, according to no one. But she had turned the hallway into a greenhouse of scavenged plants and mismatched tea mugs. The building was supposed to be condemned, but Mira called it “pre-sanctified.” Said the city had only forgotten it because it wasn’t ready to remember it yet.

She offered Romy coffee made in a repurposed moka pot balanced on a camping stove and a stack of banned zines to read while it brewed.

“You’re not broken,” she said without preamble, like she’d been waiting to say it.

Romy blinked.

“I didn’t say I was.”

“You didn’t have to. Your silence is very articulate.”

---

Mira didn’t ask for backstory. She just listened to the static in between Romy’s answers. Said she could hear frequencies that weren’t words — pain shaped like detuned piano chords.

But she never treated Romy like a problem to be solved.

Mira believed in friction. She said healing wasn’t about going back to normal. It was about learning to walk differently with the limp.

And for once, Romy didn’t feel like a glitch in someone else's program. She felt like a signal — scrambled, maybe, but coming through.

1qcct56,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qcct56,Flashlight Startup Company - First Product - Requesting Feedback,"Hello folks!

My name is Grant and I have been slowly and methodically developing my own flashlight product over the past few years with my free time. I originally started this project as an engineering hobby aside from my day job as an engineer to test my manufacturing/product design background with a real world product development challenge.

I have always been at least a bit intrigued by flashlights, and a few years ago I purchased a D4V2 flashlight and was absolutely blown away with its capability and range of emitter options (this is coming from a guy who had only ever handled hardware store and cheap Amazon lights). The search of high-quality lights while combing through low-CRI and claimed “1 million lumen + tactical” lights led me to this forum, and I appreciate such a large community like this existing.

To bring clarity to my intentions behind this project, my goal is to create a flashlight that serves as a reliable and repairable tool, not a hotrod, while having well-regarded emitter options available, as well as good quality-of-life features, like ingress protection and USB-C charging. This product will serve as an initial product to kick off my startup business, with the intention of designing thoughtful, useful, (and again repairable) lighting products for many different tasks and trades.

Some basic specifications:

* Body: CNC milled 6061 aluminum (not lathe-turned eh?)
   * Clear anodizing looks sick, but will do other colors as well.
* Construction architecture:
   * “Sandwich” architecture, with grip, heatsink, and optic cap sealed with flat gaskets and only 2 long screws. This should make maintenance, tinkering, and modding very easy.
   * Recessed brass button
* Battery: Basic flat-top 18650
* Emitter: CREE XHP 50.3 HI
   * Using this LED because it is a good balance of tint, efficiency, and CRI. Will have other options available, this is just the LED selected before “design-freeze” to make sure things are working.
* LED Driver: Buck/Boost architecture (currently targeted for 12V LEDs)
   * Strong effort to consider long-term sleep/storage to prevent parasitic drain of battery cell.
   * Boost 3.7V to 12V and drive LED with constant current output.
   * Temperature derating of LED to ensure it does not burn out (or burn your hand!)
   * I am not electrical engineer, so I did hire a contract EE to assist me with both the LED driver optimization, as well as writing firmware to make it work.
* Firmware: Anduril 2 “like” firmware on STM32 chip
   * With USB-C charging and NeoPixels implemented, I figured it would be best to write firmware from scratch rather than reverse engineer Anduril 2 onto a 32-bit chip.
   * Hopefully this firmware is acceptable. Trying to keep things simple, but take advantage of 32-bit architecture and NeoPixels.
* Optic: 26.5mm Carclo lens. Very common.
   * Double AR-coated glass lens to protect the optic
* Pocket clip:
   * None yet… have screws to allow addition in the future…
   * Should this part be a pacing item for launch? Or add later?
* USB-C charging
   * No protective rubber plug or flap on charging port, but IPX8 rating of connector should protect from water and dust ingress (think of the charging port on your phone).
      * Perhaps an optional dust cover could be included? Not sure…
* 4x NeoPixel LEDs
   * Battery check indication
   * Red light mode?

I aspire not only to create the best product I can, but to also set an example for starting a manufacturing business in today’s competitive and saturated marketplace.

My high-level goal/roadmap is a follows:

* Launch initial flashlight product. Assemble flashlights in-house using outside CNC & PCB suppliers
* Move to a commercial manufacturing space, purchase tooling, make CNC’d parts in house and assemble.
* Purchase equipment necessary to test every product against recognized MIL and ASME standards. Provide tracible test data to customers.
* Create a lean manufacturing line complete with CNC’d part tooling, PCB pick and place equipment, anodizing, etc.
* Create a diverse product portfolio covering many different trades, jobs, and outdoor adventures
* Become a recognized leader in the consumer lighting and lean manufacturing space

Our connected world makes it easier than ever before to reach enthusiasts like you to gather feedback on such a product existing, and what YOU would want to see in a new flashlight product.

**I am also looking for your feedback in general on what you think of a company like this existing. Do we need ANOTHER flashlight company? How would I need to set myself apart to be competitive?**

At the time of writing this post, the PCB and its firmware are going through a revision to go from a development board to its final form factor, and I am about to perform a pressure decay test on the assembly to ensure correct selection of gasket material and durometer (hardness).

**If you are interested in supporting this project, feel free to** [**buy me a coffee**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/wapsietorch) **(donate to my startup company)!** Funding tooling and product validation equipment before launch is the top priority right now.

**I am aiming to launch a YouTube channel VERY soon to provide video updates on the development of the project and my journey so far to get to this point.** I still have yet to decide if a soft launch like a Kickstarter campaign would be appropriate for this product, or how I should go about that. I will provide an update on what I decide.

I won’t plug myself too much at this time without having a product to sell you yet. Stay tuned for more! **I am very excited to share my journey with you all!** Thanks!

Now that I'm an adult I'm still living with my parents, which isn't uncommon these days with the cost of living even without extra problems, but my hope to live on my own is looking grim. I feel bad to complain as many have it far worse but I just need to anyway. Here are the issues:

1. Money... I'm working less than 10 hours a week currently, which I'm happy that I've even been able to get and keep work, but as is I feel like my ""plate"" is almost full, and I just got another cleaning job which is great money wise and will put me at around 16-17 hours per week. I'm not sure I've ever worked that many hours. I'm just afraid because even though I really need more money if I ever hope to leave home, I just am worried I will be unable to sustain it, I keep pushing myself and being warned against it then everything falls apart and I end up worse than I was before. I'm just hoping this will not be the case and I hate myself for being able to do so little. I get government pension also but especially with where I live and medication costs etc I think financially it could maybe still not work. If I make about $900 a week after I start the new job, and rent already costs hundreds a week, then chemist bill is like $150pw, then I have petrol, groceries, insurance, other bills and living essential expenses (don't buy coffee or subscriptions or anything I don't need). Maybe I will be lucky and have a tiny bit of extra money each week and cross my fingers and hope that if I need it for if my car need repairs or a whole new one or whatever else life throws at me, it will be enough. Obviously at that point don't even think about ever owning a unit or anything 😭 because I never will...

2. Practical responsibilities of living on my own. I really badly want to live on my own but idk, I guess maybe it's executive functioning(?) and other stuff that is already meaning I'm not getting stuff like keeping my room tidy and eating properly/enough (working on it), doing my washing, keeping on top of hygiene stuff is hard/doesn't get done frequently enough. I get help also but I feel like a complete failure for it and so try keep it to the minimum hours I can get someone out to help (3 hours). I KNOW how to do the tasks, but it feels like maybe I'm just putting my everything into doing what I need for my cleaning job that when I'm home I have ""nothing left"", it's not as structured and more distractions/other stuff to do.... Honestly I don't know. Of course I don't make my support worker do stuff for me, more we both might just do a task or she makes sure I stay and do it, but it feels so embarrassing and like I'm completely wasting people tax money and I think about people who have it way worse than me. 

3. I feel like I would need a partner or something to be able to navigate and handle life + double income and share other money related things. At this point I don't even have like a social life, I sort of have online friends to a degree and to a very minor degree real life social stuff, maybe like every 1-2 months sometimes less frequently honestly.

Even doing that is hard and a lot and tbh I don't like that friend even and so I don't know what I am doing ... But the point is if even that is hard to do and they are mainly reaching out to me and things, how TF would I be able to do a whole relationship? I'm not even sure what I would want or be able to deal with in a relationship even if time and energy among other things weren't an issue. 

I have no idea if I want like a partner where we are committed but not romantic or sexual and more like ultimate besties due to intense feelings of caring about someone being horrific for me and anything but nice, so maybe if I just have someone that I feel ""confortable"" with and get along with but don't feel attatched it could be ok. The thing is my attempts at relationships have been miserable, and all of them were when I didn't really have responsibilies yet. 

1st one was my bestie for a few months (but me not hers ofc) then we dated for like 2 weeks before she cheated on me with 2 other people. 

Second was me being gullible and tricked by someone online for a few months who wasn't very nice to say the least and lied far more than they told the truth. 

3rd was while I was inpatient and who I lost my v card to. I was silly to care about her and I wasn't her main relationship, she was a massive liar and not to be mean but the only reason she got with me was because the only people she wouldn't sleep with was men, or someone underage or dead, she had slept with basically everyone including all her friends....


I just can't care about someone without it being ""too much"" and relationships are just so confusing to me as with anything else interpersonal. All I do is fear they are lying to me and don't love me and will leave me and it only brings far more negative things into my life than positive and I'm essentially distressed very frequently. Good luck on me finding someone nice when the only people who want me are people where the bar is on the ground basically.

I have a lot of confusion around what I want in relationships and other things I am just not sure about relationship wise and so that's another thing.

Plus since I would probably have to start the relationship while I am with my parents before we live together, my parents play a huge step in a barrier there. My mum has become a lot more respectful in the past few years about me being attracted to women, my dad maybe has slightly (although his youtube feed is filled with much ""phobic"" content, with blatantly anti-lgbt content as apart of some of it) improved too. 

Last relationship I had my parents had to know where I was at all times, had to always share my location, my parents would always blow up my phone if I went out especially if they suspected it was with her, they would be a lot less ""nice"" to me and passive aggressive, would try to scare me out of staying over at hers and things, to would not let her stay over in my room, had to always tell them where I was going etc. They got a bit better with it near the end of the short relationship at least so it could be better. But even now my dad always wants to know where I am and even if I go out the front door and put something in my car and come back inside in like 10 seconds my dad wants to know what I just did. He opens and reads everyones mail and in general doesn't respect privacy. So really, I don't know, and relationships seem to ""flare things up"" so... I think it's not unrealistic to say it will ""flare back up"" again and be more tense and difficult with family if I wanted to date or something.

Anyways, I know nobody will probably read this whole novel of a vent but it's nice to get it out anyway. I'm lucky to get government supports and have a roof over my head and food in my stomach, and Ive been getting TMS funded since I've tried so many treatments for some of my mental illnesses but they haven't budged a heap. It's helped and I'm grateful for it but still kicks my butt daily. I supposedly have a personality disorder too and so that only makes remission harder I'm sure if that's true. I feel so suffocated by everything and trying my best... In not even studying anything so it's embarrassing that I am struggling and feel so shit when all I do is work a little bit and that's basically it.",2,1768361955.0,venting,2,1.0,False

Im just struggling and cant talk to anyone i know about it and i need advice from strangers. Sorry if this post is unorganized, long or if i have misspelled words i suck at spelling.

So ive always known or thought i had mental problems.. i have lots of early childhood trauma and etc (it started around 3 or 4) im not sensitive about it and barely remember like anything before i was 10, but i notice that whenever i bring it up causally people get uncomfy and walk on eggshells around me after they know. Its not that i dont like that i just dont what people to feel sorry for me when i barely remember anything and i have no problems talking about my trauma but because of people's reactions i just dont talk about it unless asked (which rarely happens).

The main reason this is important is because with early trauma such as mine and the nature of mine (i want go into detail because i dont want to trigger or upset anyone) but i will say it involves grooming of a sexual nature at the age of 3 or 4 and again when i was more grown, and an abusive step father at 5 to 6. There are more things but again like i said i wont go into detail (unless yall ask me to ig) but those or the main things before i can remember.

So like i was saying. With early childhood trauma its very hard to know what is trauma-learned or already there. As i dont remember like anything before the age of 10 so i dont remember how i was before. Anyways. But to my original problem... i think i have combined adhd and autism.. please dont try to educate me about the basic stuff, i have done a lot of research.

But my main problem is i dont know is its just stuff i learned through trauma or i actually have and what to even do about it if i do have it. I know i mask like my entire personality with everyone and thats why i cant ask anyone in my life about this. And my mother is an OT and sometimes works with low functioning autistic people. So since im not like them to her i must not be autistic (btw my father is not in my life). And when i told her i want to get assessed for adhd she said she had adhd and diagnoses wont do anything, they will just give me pills and i just need to drink coffee and focus.

SO i dont know how to proceed because i think my adhd is starting to mess with my life more than ever and i am struggling and i just wont to get assessed and know how my brain works so i can focus and get shit done...

1qcci0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1qcci0s/i_gave_up_peanut_butter_and_ive_been_having_the/,I gave up peanut butter and i've been having the best shits of my life,"I LOVE peanut butter... absolutely love it. I'm a large and very active man, I eat a lot of salads, eggs, meat, fruit, oatmeal, cereal, and fucking peanut butter and jellies.

Despite a large amount of food and taking greens powders and drinking kombucha daily, my poops have never been adequate. They've been twice a day, like clockwork, but I hadn't felt satisfied from a poop in a long time.

I went on vacation for 4 weeks a few months ago and I forgot to pack my peanut butter when I was packing the RV but I packed my wife's peanut butter  and I just figured i'd eat some of hers but I never did.

After about a week into the trip, I was pooping like 3-4 bowl filling poops a day... I was actually becoming concerned about how much I was shitting. I was literally filling half the toilet bowl with these giant turds, 3-4 times a day, for about a week (I was having a hard time flushing them down the RV toilet, I thought about the ""poop knife"" story that I read years ago and was like ""now I understand!""). After that initial week, It calmed down to my normal 2 a day poops but they were LARGE. I dropped a whole pant size by the time I got home.

Fast forward, I get back home, immediately start eating peanut butter and start taking my smaller poops again... I just figured it was because of lack of stress while on vacation that my body ""let go"", so to speak.

Finally, one day, it hit me that I didnt eat peanut butter while on vacation and I decided to experiment by cutting my beloved PB&J's out again. Lo and behold I started taking extremely large and girthy dumps again, I've been so satisfied after my daily dukes but my life feels so empty without my PB&J's... I feel like a crackhead, I know they're bad for me but I want them SO bad. I tried almond butter but that shit sucks and isnt even worth eating.

Anyway, thats my confession... I want peanut butter, i want it bad... but I also want to take enormous shits and I cant have both :'(

Edit- Funny story, I always do 2 poops in the morning, 1 before my morning run, and 1 after I get home and drink my coffee and im totally done for the day. The day that my asshole decided to start it's weeklong journey to expelling all of its contents, I was on the side of a mountain, on a very busy trail with nowhere to shit. I had to penguin walk down the mountain (you know, the walk where you clench your ass cheeks together and walk as fast as possible so out dont shit yourself) and there was a little teeny tiny gas station that literally closed 3 minutes before I got there. I then proceeded to penguin walk the mile to the RV, It was 28 degrees outside but I was pouring sweat and when I sat down, my asshole literally erupted. Im glad my wife stayed behind and hiked the trail because I moaned more sitting on that toilet than I did on our wedding night ",46,1768361237.0,confessions,12,0.96,False

1qccfvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1qccfvm/partner_m46_pursed_by_friends/,Partner [M46] pursed by “friends”,"My partner \[M46\] and I \[F42\] have been together for a little over a year. Over that time he has had two women pursue him. One he casually dated, although he claims they didn’t, whilst there was no physical intimacy other than a couple of kisses, they went on dates and he met her son. She was upset when we got together (perhaps justified as he obviously hadn’t told her he wasn’t actually dating her in his mind) she was quiet rude about me to him, he was confused about this as he didn’t understand why she would be like that as a friend. I told him she obviously thought more of their relationship. He insisted that they were just friends and that he felt let down by her as she had been very kind to him when his mother passed away not long after they met. They continued interacting, mostly through sending reels via social media she continued saying subtly veiled nasty things about me which I said was disrespectful and that he should tell her to stop and tell her he was in a relationship. A few months later she contacted him as they had previously had plans to go interstate for a weekend to see a concert together and I told him that wasn’t an option, which he agreed with. She kept reiterating to him that she couldn’t wait to spend the weekend with him. This made me incredibly frustrated, he thought I shouldn’t be angry at him for what she was doing and that they were just friends  but I was frustrated at him for not putting a firmer boundary in place. It turned into a very big argument and he ended up telling her not to contact him again. At the same time there was another person pursuing him, they would occasionally see each other for a drink or a coffee, prior to me he used to spend a lot of time at her house and would go to a lot of music gigs with her. Again when she found out about me she was put out, she would ask him why he was dating someone who had what she referred to as “baggage” (meaning my son) would send him inappropriate messages and would proposition him sexually. She would comment negatively on me if he ever posted anything on social media about me. Again he said that I should just trust him and that he hadn’t done anything, she was his good friend (they had known each other for about 6 months by the time I met him). If we ever had disagreements she would say I was toxic for trying to “push his friends away” and he would accuse me of that too. About a month ago after we had, had another big disagreement about these two people, he ended up at her house, and I found out that they were in bed (he maintains ON the bed as a distinction) cuddling - he says it’s because they were just feeling sad and he needed to feel better, he says he was “thinking about me” and that it “didn’t mean anything it was just a cuddle”. He says that she ended up propositioning her and he got up and left. When she found out we were back together she sent him another disparaging message about me and he replied saying that it wasn’t fair of her to just treat him like some available thing and that she was supposed to be his good friend. Recently he’s been expressing to me a lot of discomfort about me having “made people go away” I never did this, all I ever asked for was boundaries and said that they were showing both me and him a level of disrespect that made me uncomfortable. He keeps bringing the topic up, if we ever disagree about anything, he brings it up and says I made him send friends away and that I’m controlling. I am very aware that I should likely just leave and leave him to it.

It never feels like there's enough people for the number of tasks that need to be done, sometimes I'm expected to be on front, and make my own drinks and my own warming plus mobile's and brew coffee every 10 minutes... it's just so overwhelming. And then I had to sit through a 3h meeting where I'm told I have to take time to chat with customers and write meaningful personal messages on their cups?? Wtf.

I'm also getting very tired of being talked down to every day by rude customers. Had an old man mock me for the way I pronounce a word (English is not my first language but I've been speaking it since 7 years old and nobody else has trouble understanding me), had people get mad because I almost missed their 10 cent personal cup discount... everyday there's someone to ruin my mood.

And lastly, when I interviewed I told the manager while I'm available all day, I'm only willing to do shifts of 4-5h maximum because I have a bad back and neck and long hours standing give me major back pain and migraines. She had agreed to this, and followed through for the first month, but now every week I have at least one or two 8h shifts that are destroying me. Both my physical and mental health have tanked since starting this job and I don't think I can do it much longer.

I have in the past had anaphylaxis resulting in hospitalization from water. The past few months I have noticed that water feels (moderatly) ""spicy"" . Obviously you cannot cut out water but I made the switch to Spring Water and it was monumental. My flushing was almost entirely gone and if it was there I did not notice it and it would not hurt or bother me. I can also now tolerate leftovers consumed within 24 hours which is INCREDIBLE progress for someone who is low income like me. I am also able to break my weight barrier and can finally start to lose more weight thank gd. 

  
Now I have a question...

This relates to coffee

I have heard that coffee can contain mold of some sort.

For example, I can tolerate carrots as is but not fermented. and water spring but not purified.

So for coffee, I switched to decaf...with what I had said above, would ditching coffee all together potentially improve my symptoms?

1qccbvc,https://v.redd.it/t52wout9g8dg1,Is the Era of Physical Monitors Over?,"I’ve been spending way too much time lately thinking about my physical desk setup, and honestly, I’m starting to feel like my triple-monitor rig is becoming a relic of the past.

I was testing some new spatial computing workflows this morning, and it hit me: **We are witnessing the slow death of the ""rectangle"" as our primary way of interacting with data.** For decades, we’ve been confined to these glowing glass boxes—whether it’s a phone, a tablet, or a monitor. But after spending a few hours working with windows pinned to my actual physical walls and having a 3D model of a project sitting on my coffee table, coming back to a flat screen felt... claustrophobic.

# Here is what’s messing with my head:

* **The ""Weight"" of Reality:** I love the idea of an infinite canvas, but I’ll be the first to admit that wearing a ""computer"" on my face for four hours straight still feels like a chore. The tech is getting lighter, but the friction is still there.
* **Privacy vs. Presence:** In my spatial office, I feel more ""present"" in my work, but I also realize that the device is mapping every inch of my private room to make that happen. It’s a trade-off I’m still trying to process.
* **The Social Cost:** My wife walked into the room while I was deep in a ""spatial"" focus session. To her, I was just a guy staring blankly into space in a silent room. That disconnect is weird, right?

I’m genuinely curious about where you guys stand on this. I personally think we’re about two hardware iterations away from physical monitors becoming ""legacy tech"" for anyone who doesn't do high-end color grading.

**Do you think we’re actually ready to ditch our physical screens for good, or is the ""comfort"" of a traditional monitor something we’ll never truly give up?** I’d love to hear if anyone else has tried a ""monitor-less"" week and how it actually went for your productivity (or your sanity).",1,1768360755.0,MetaversePlanet2,0,1.0,False

2. Primo: lamb ravioli in lamb broth with citrus, fresh bread, salted Italian butter

3. Main: venison with dolceforte and blackberries and a grilled vegetable skewer

4. Dessert: chocolate hazelnut tourbillon

5. Another gift: vanilla gelato with sour cherries

A bit of a late post - I visited back in November. This was my first Michelin-starred restaurant and my first time in Italy, so I do not have much experience to compare this to but I quite enjoyed it.

I arrived a few minutes late (couldn't get a taxi) but they were very gracious. I arrived at 7:15 and the restaurant was mostly empty, but it filled up as the evening went on (I understand Italians tend to eat late). The staff was friendly and attentive, and my waitress spoke excellent English. The other staff spoke good English but were a bit more reserved, but not cold.

I ordered a la carte, in part to keep the cost down, but I wasn't made to feel at all odd or unwelcome for that.

I dined in the front dining room - there was another, larger dining room in the back and I think a third downstairs. It was a little bit dark. There were some paintings on the walls but overall it felt comfortable but nothing too out of the ordinary.

The food:

The amuse-bouche was a nice surprise. The Mozzarella was very delicate and milky. The pork belly had a good flavor. The other bites had a nice texture.

The ravioli was my favorite part of the meal. The citrus balanced against the meaty flavor of the broth very well. The butter was also excellent - maybe the best I've ever had. Bread was good but nothing to write home about.

The venison was maybe the weakest part of the meal, but still quite good. The cook was great and the dolceforte was good. I do question the use of blackberries - there were only three and they were tiny (at least compared to the blackberries I'm used to in the US). It was about 6 bites of meat, so you're couldn't get a piece of fruit in each bite, and even if you did have a whole blackberry with a bite of meat you couldn't taste it. The vegetable skewer was also good and the smokiness complemented the dolceforte very well. 

Tourbillon was also very good, crunchy and the hazelnut came through. 

The gelato was another surprise and also very good, probably the best I had on the trip. 

I didn't take a picture, but their espresso was good enough to convert me to an espresso drinker (I've never been a fan of coffee).

Overall I would go back. I left feeling full but not stuffed. The main negative that stood out to me was that it was a bit loud - I could hear sirens going by every couple of minutes the entire time I was there. Besides that it was a very positive experience.",42,1768360540.0,finedining,5,0.98,False

**What Makes Winter Hard on Tiny Noses?**

* The Dry Air

Cold air simply can’t hold onto moisture as warmer air does. When the heater runs nonstop, it makes the indoor air even drier. This can turn the normal mucus in their nose into thick, sticky goo that’s hard to clear out.

* The “Coffee Stir Stick” Dilemma

Adults have larger airways, but babies’ airways are more like tiny coffee stirrers. Even a little swelling or a small amount of mucus can make them feel like they’re gasping for air, especially at night or while feeding.

**A Simple Routine to Ease Winter Sniffles**

Step 1: Add Moisture

Consider using a cool-mist humidifier; a cheap humidity meter can help you maintain levels between 30-50%.

Step 2: Clear It Out

After the saline has sat for a minute, using suction is much more effective. If you're using [Grownsy SniffEase Nasal Aspirator](https://grownsy.com/products/adjustable-suction-nasal-aspirator-with-3-soft-tips?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=sns&utm_campaign=NasalAspirator_260114), try this simple method: start at the lowest suction level and only increase if necessary (there are three levels). Plus, the light and music features can help keep your baby calm for those essential 30 seconds, making it a lot less messy to manage.

In October, I bought an 1886 Queen Anne in my hometown because I missed my family and had had enough of big city life. Then, on Sunday, my aunt brought over the four granddaughters of the former owners (she's friends with them). They spent more than two hours walking through the house with me, telling stories about growing up here, and it was magical.

I’ve always lived in old houses, but I’d never had a connection to the people who lived in one before. Now I do, and the house will never feel the same.

Their grandparents lived here from 1947–1978, then one of their sons (uncle to the sisters) lived here until 1998, renting it out before selling in 2000. This is a family with deep emotional ties to the homes connected to their loved ones. When their father died, they kept his house for almost five years and would go there after church to make lunch, just to feel close to him. 

My house is no different. A few weeks ago, one sister drove by, saw my big Christmas tree in the front window along with the icicle lights on the front porch, started crying, took a photo, and texted her sister: “Finally, someone lives in the house who loves it.” (She’s correct, btw.)

The house has been through a lot in the past 25 years—severe tornado damage that nearly led to demolition, renters (ugh), an owner with severely questionable taste, and a flipper (ugh).

After this weekend’s visit, so many quirks suddenly made sense. The angled ceiling under the coat closet? Their grandfather removed the servants’ stairs and that was the underside of the staircase. The sidewalk that disappears under the garage? It used to lead to their grandmother’s vegetable garden. The oddly shaped first-floor bathroom? A last-minute addition when she could no longer climb the stairs and turned a parlor into her bedroom.

They described the original flowery Victorian wallpaper that covered the walls—and even the ceilings. They told me where the furniture sat. One sister sewed her wedding dress and bridesmaids’ dresses in what’s now my living room. Their uncle played Christmas carols the accordion by the light of the Christmas tree and set of glass light-up deer in the front parlor. They bathed in a metal tub in the kitchen as kids. Their grandmother made donuts every morning, and the town’s police officers and factory workers would stop by for coffee and donuts, parking on the side lawn because there was no driveway and no curb.

They even brought me banana bread made from their grandmother’s recipe.

It was magical...nostalgic for them and informative for me. And now, I don’t just live in this house...I feel connected to it.",146,1768360500.0,centuryhomes,8,0.99,False

I’m hoping the owners are made aware of this behaviour, as it should be corrected. It’s very sad to see a young employee shunned for simply trying, and my experience here has been overall ruined.

1qcc658,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_macebooks/comments/1qcc658/oneonone_meetings_the_30minute_weekly_practice/,One-on-One Meetings: The 30-Minute Weekly Practice That Improves Retention by 8%,"A one-on-one meeting is a recurring conversation between a manager and their direct report, typically lasting 30 minutes and held weekly. Its purpose is to build trust, surface issues early, provide feedback, and support the employee's growth and performance.

Done well, one-on-ones are among the highest-leverage activities a manager can do. Done poorly or skipped entirely they create disconnection, missed problems, and higher turnover.

# Why One-on-Ones Matter: What the Research Shows

The case for regular one-on-ones isn't based on management theory. It's based on measured outcomes across thousands of managers and employees.

**On engagement:** Gallup research found that employees who have regular one-on-one meetings with their manager are almost three times as likely to be engaged compared to those who don't. Separately, 86% of companies with highly engaged workforces hold one-on-ones regularly, compared to only 50% of disengaged organizations.

**On retention and results:** Manager Tools studied over 175,000 managers and found that weekly one-on-ones improved both results and retention by an average of 8%. Biweekly meetings showed only about 3% improvement. Monthly meetings actually *decreased* results and retention compared to no structured meetings at all.

**On manager effectiveness:** Google's Project Oxygen research identified that managers who hold frequent one-on-ones with their team consistently score higher in performance evaluations than those who don't.

**On employee experience:** Research from O.C. Tanner found that employees who have weekly or biweekly one-on-ones are 157% more likely to believe their manager understands the realities of their day-to-day work. MIT Sloan research showed that employees with weekly one-on-ones reported feeling 20% less anxious about these meetings and 12% more successful in their jobs compared to those meeting less frequently.

The pattern is consistent: regular, well-run one-on-ones correlate with better engagement, better retention, and better performance. Infrequent or poorly run meetings often make things worse.

# The Core Principles

Before the tactics, understand what makes one-on-ones work:

**It's their meeting, not yours.** The employee should drive the agenda. This is their dedicated time to raise concerns, ask questions, get feedback, and discuss their development. Your job is to listen, ask good questions, and help them get what they need.

**Consistency matters more than perfection.** A reliable 30-minute weekly meeting beats an occasional hour-long conversation. Predictability builds trust. Canceling or constantly rescheduling signals that the employee isn't a priority.

**It's not a status update.** Project updates can happen in email, Slack, or team meetings. One-on-ones are for the things that don't fit in those formats: challenges, frustrations, ideas, career goals, feedback, and relationship-building.

**Trust compounds over time.** The first few one-on-ones may feel awkward or surface-level. That's normal. Real openness develops after employees see that you follow through, keep confidences, and genuinely care about their success.

# How to Structure a One-on-One

The Manager Tools method, validated across hundreds of thousands of managers, uses a simple 30-minute structure:

**First 10 minutes: Their agenda.** The employee talks about whatever is on their mind. This could be a problem they're facing, a question about priorities, something they're proud of, or something bothering them. Your job is to listen, ask follow-up questions, and understand.

**Second 10 minutes: Your agenda.** Share information they need, provide feedback, discuss upcoming changes, or raise concerns you've observed. Keep this focused—if you dominate the meeting, it stops being valuable for them.

**Final 10 minutes: Development.** Discuss their goals, career trajectory, skills they want to build, or growth opportunities. This doesn't need to happen every meeting, but it should happen regularly.

This isn't the only structure that works. Some managers prefer different formats. But the principle holds: the employee's needs come first, followed by the manager's needs, with ongoing attention to development.

# Practical Guidance

# Frequency: Weekly is the Standard

Research consistently points to weekly meetings as most effective. If weekly isn't feasible perhaps you manage a large team, biweekly is the next best option. Monthly meetings don't work; by the time you meet, issues have festered and the connection has weakened.

For a team of five or fewer, weekly 30-minute one-on-ones are manageable (2.5 hours per week). For larger teams, consider 30 minutes biweekly, or adjust duration based on role complexity.

# Duration: 30 Minutes is Usually Right

Thirty minutes is long enough to cover meaningful topics but short enough to stay focused. Some employees especially those in complex roles or who manage others may benefit from 45-60 minutes. But start with 30 and adjust based on need.

Shorter meetings (15-20 minutes) tend to stay surface-level. Longer meetings (60+ minutes) often lose focus unless there's specific reason.

# Scheduling: Protect the Time

Schedule one-on-ones as recurring meetings. Let employees choose from available time slots when possible this small act of control increases their investment.

Treat the meeting as nearly inviolable. Rescheduling occasionally is fine; repeatedly canceling or deprioritizing sends a clear message that the employee doesn't matter.

Avoid scheduling one-on-ones right before or after high-stress events (performance reviews, major presentations) unless you're specifically discussing those events.

# Location: Create Comfort

The goal is a setting where the employee feels comfortable speaking openly. A private office or conference room works. Some managers take occasional one-on-ones outside—walking meetings or coffee shops which can feel less formal and encourage more open conversation.

For remote teams, video is better than phone. Nonverbal cues matter for building connection and reading how someone is actually doing.

# Preparation: Come Ready

**For managers:** Review notes from the last meeting. Check on any action items you committed to. Think about feedback you want to share or topics you need to raise. Know what's happening with this person's work.

**For employees:** Set the expectation that they drive the agenda. Some managers ask employees to send agenda items in advance; others keep it informal. Either works—what matters is that the employee comes with something to discuss.

# During the Meeting: Listen More Than Talk

The biggest mistake managers make is talking too much. This is the employee's meeting. Ask open-ended questions (starting with ""what"" and ""how""), then listen to the full answer before responding.

Take notes—what your people say matters enough to write down. Note their concerns, commitments you make, and action items for both of you. Review these notes before the next meeting.

Avoid the trap of immediately solving every problem raised. Sometimes employees need to vent or think through something out loud. Ask ""Do you want me to help solve this, or do you just need to talk it through?"" before jumping to solutions.

# After the Meeting: Follow Through

If you committed to do something, do it. Nothing destroys one-on-one effectiveness faster than a manager who says ""I'll look into that"" and never does. Your follow-through teaches employees whether these meetings are worth their investment.

Keep a simple record of what was discussed and any action items. This doesn't need to be elaborate—a few bullet points work. The record helps you track patterns over time and ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

# Questions That Work

Good questions open up meaningful conversation. Poor questions get one-word answers.

**On their work:**

* What's taking up most of your time right now?
* What's the biggest obstacle you're facing?
* What would make your work easier this week?
* Is there anything you're stuck on that I could help with?

**On your relationship and their support:**

* How can I better support you?
* Is there anything I'm doing that's getting in your way?
* Do you feel like you're getting enough feedback from me?
* What's something you wish I understood better about your work?

**On their development:**

* What skills do you want to build this year?
* Where do you see yourself in two years?
* What part of your job do you enjoy most? Least?
* What would help you grow in your role?

**On the team and organization:**

* Is there anything happening on the team I should know about?
* How are things going with \[specific colleague or project\]?
* What's one thing we could do differently as a team?

Avoid questions that sound like interrogation or that you could answer yourself by checking their work. The point is to learn what you can't see from the outside.

# Common Mistakes

**Treating it as a status meeting.** If you spend the whole time on project updates, you've missed the point. Status updates can happen asynchronously.

**Doing all the talking.** If you leave a one-on-one having talked 70% of the time, something went wrong. Aim for the employee to talk at least half the time, ideally more.

**Canceling repeatedly.** Every cancellation signals priorities. Occasional rescheduling is fine. Patterns of cancellation tell employees they're not important.

**Avoiding difficult topics.** One-on-ones are the right place for difficult conversations—concerns about performance, behavior feedback, or tough organizational news. Avoiding these topics doesn't make them go away.

**Not following through.** If you say you'll do something, do it. Broken commitments accumulate into broken trust.

**Making it about you.** Venting to your direct report about your problems isn't appropriate for this meeting. They have their own concerns.

**Skipping development.** It's easy to fill every meeting with immediate work concerns. But employees also need to discuss their growth, goals, and future. Make time for it.

# For Employees: Getting More From Your One-on-Ones

One-on-ones are more valuable when employees approach them actively rather than passively waiting for their manager to lead.

**Come prepared.** Have at least one or two things you want to discuss. Don't wait for your manager to pull topics out of you.

**Raise important issues early.** Don't drop a significant concern in the last two minutes. If something matters, bring it up with enough time to discuss it properly.

**Be honest.** Your manager can only help with problems they know about. The meeting is private—use it to share what you might not say in a group setting.

**Ask for what you need.** If you need more feedback, clearer priorities, different types of work, or help with a colleague, say so. Managers aren't mind-readers.

**Give feedback upward.** If your manager does something that helps you, tell them. If they do something that makes your job harder, tell them that too. Good managers want to know.

# Adapting to Context

One-on-ones aren't one-size-fits-all. The approach should flex based on the employee and situation.

**For new employees:** Meet more frequently early on (possibly twice weekly) and focus on onboarding questions, clarity about expectations, and building the relationship. As they get established, move to standard weekly meetings.

**For experienced, autonomous employees:** The meeting can be shorter or less structured. You might focus more on development and strategic topics, less on day-to-day work.

**For employees who manage others:** Consider longer meetings (45-60 minutes) and include discussion of their team dynamics, management challenges, and leadership development.

**For remote employees:** Video is important—you lose too much without visual cues. Consider occasional in-person one-on-ones when possible, even if most are remote.

**When things are going well:** Don't skip the meeting. Use it for recognition, development focus, and maintaining the relationship. The meeting matters as much in good times as in difficult ones.

**When things are going poorly:** This is when one-on-ones matter most. Address concerns directly, provide clear feedback, and document the conversation. Difficult conversations are part of the manager's job.

# Making It Sustainable

For managers with multiple direct reports, one-on-ones can feel time-consuming. But consider the alternative: problems you don't learn about until they're crises, employees who disengage because they don't feel heard, and turnover that costs far more than the meeting time.

Some practices that help:

* Block one-on-one time together in your calendar (e.g., Tuesday afternoons for all one-on-ones) to reduce context-switching
* Keep the format simple—don't over-engineer with complex templates
* Use a simple note-taking system you'll actually maintain
* Recognize that the time you invest in one-on-ones reduces time spent on problems later

The math usually works out: managers who maintain consistent one-on-ones report fewer surprises, less firefighting, and more productive teams overall.

# Summary

Effective one-on-one meetings follow a few key principles:

* Hold them weekly, for about 30 minutes, at a consistent time
* Let the employee drive the agenda—it's their meeting
* Listen more than you talk
* Cover their concerns first, then yours, with regular attention to their development
* Take notes and follow through on commitments
* Don't cancel except when truly necessary

The research is clear: managers who hold regular, well-run one-on-ones build more engaged teams, retain more employees, and get better results. The investment is 30 minutes per week per employee. The return is a team that trusts you, communicates openly, and performs at a higher level.",1,1768360318.0,u_macebooks,0,1.0,False

1qcbu5h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qcbu5h,Why the Malvika Sitlani case hits so bad and makes a mockery of those who are saving.,"I would have loved to make a LinkedIn Post but I need to protect my professional image. Firstly, I have fully sympathy for her mom and wish her speedy recovery.

I am similar to Malvika a divorced single mom and let’s say earning in the same range - I also don’t have any support and am fully dependent on myself. However I have been very prudent in saving for a decade now. I don’t drink the fancy coffees, buy the designer bags or eat fancy meals out all the time (I am not saying I haven’t indulged occasionally). I have a fair estimate of what she should have saved by now and what kind of insurance back up she should have. What hurts is I’ve spent years watching these Instagram stories wondering what am I doing wrong? How come these people are buying fancy coffee machines, flexing designer bags and living this lifestyle whereas I do think of every expense.

Up until last month (I am sharing some pictures) she is still drinking fancy coffee,putting out fancy meals, flexing a fancy gym. So she chooses to live this lifestyle and when there is a rainy day, she gets to e beg from people. And she doesn’t even have the decency to stop posting her lifestyle a few days before the fund raiser. She is putting up meals she ate outside, the coffee she needs.

I don’t expect fairness from the world. But yes I am glad she is getting called out. And I do hope the necessary authorities look into what is essentially fraudulent fund raising.

This is a lesson that influencers show a lifetstyle but are running through their money like quick sand. 
 Don’t move to Dubai and act like going from a 3 bhk to 2 bhk is a compromise. What a joke!

Dunno why yesterday I am in a very good mood for pulling shots. Dialed em up on my office's breville bambino and smart grinder. It turned out to be one of the most boring espresso in a very very very pleasing way. It tasted very generic with decent sweetness and rounded acidity.

It's a coffee that satisfies both coffee nerd like me and some of my coworkers who usually avoid acidity like a plague.

The taste kinda similar to a sugarcane colombian decaf espresso that I drink after a year long coffee hiaitus due to health issues. Both are very boring in a very very very pleasing way.",1,1768359379.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Blood shot eyes that looked as if they might crack, to bleed. Bags beneath each so heavy they dragged down each cheek, Painted in various shades of purple.

Body left to sway every which way atop the chair he had been forced to stand, to stick another picture near the top of the case board. ""What's that make it, twice this week?""

Hand pressed upon the lower back of this officer that had been left to nearly tip over. Seemed the one that had caught him hadn't been any better off, Having started to see the world spin about his head.

""He hasn't been here since last month, Not since that mutt of his got into the back of that truck.""  Fishing line being used to connect the various push pins he pressed into the town map.

""Was wondering why I couldn't find a turkey this year. . ."" Knees left to partially buckle under his own weight now that he stepped down from the chair.

""You and me both"" Heard from the other officer left cutting the excess line.

Eyeing the stack of crumpled, paper cups that lay scattered across the joined desks.  Who's turn was it to get coffee?"" The first officer asked.

""Just grab a cup from the machine down the hall."" Twang of fishing line heard, Officer having taken a moment to test the tension.

""Anyone try it yet?"" Having taken a seat in the chair he'd once been standing. First chance he'd have to rest since earlier that morning.

""Not that I've seen, can't be any worse then what's been left sitting in the pot."" Spool of fishing line tossed atop his desk, now taking a break of his own. Sitting now behind the desk that had been his own.

""Who even drinks that stuff, anyway."" Slamming of a filing box heard atop the desks both sat. Having been stacked three high as a more heated voice of a third officer heard.

""If you two mooks got time to sit around, why don't you give me a hand with all these, Back's killing me."" This officer looking as if he couldn't even stand up strait, left partially hunched over the side of both desks. Both looking as if they were about to give him a piece of their mind. Probably would have, if it hadn't seen the kid seen from the corner of their eyes.

""Just let me get a cup off coffee first, And I'll meet you down there."" Creaking of the chair heard, as the first officer passed the boy by. Third left to mutter beneath his breath. ""What wise guy thought the sub basement was the best place for storage.""

Jack having more or less been more interested at this point in gnawing at the side of a donut he'd been given. The sounds he made trying to bite into it, more akin to the sound a canine might make working through a bowl of kibble. Even giving an off putting knock the moment the boy left it to drop atop the desk he sat. Seemed even the long bath it had been given did little to soften it's petrified exterior.

Plucking sound heard from the string that had been the boy's fishing line. Left to stare, to wait for whatever had been lurking within the murk that had been his drink. String now pulled, as the boy was left to stare upon the dripping bag that had been his bait. Left to watch it slowly spin a few times before dropping it beside the wig and bonnet left atop the desk. Mug nearly pressed against the boy's lips, to pause brief now that he stare down upon his pinkie that would slowly lift. Only now would the boy try this thing called tea.

Sip had all it would take for the boy to know the bitterness of this drink. Without warning the boy now stood, watching the man in blue now pass him by, sipping from a paper cup. Jack's own cup now placed beside the tattered, sludge covered gown he had been dressed. Left in only his muddy, wool pajamas. Left alone in the hall that lead one towards an exit. Left to stare upon the massive box that had been dangling countless treasures from hook like branches.

Reaching for the one he had wanted, only to be stopped by some unseen wall. Something that left the boy to stare, upon the spot his hand was left to  press, before staring down upon the large symbols that had been carved upon each wooden button. To press upon the one that matched the symbols carved upon the one he wanted. Just how long had this boy been left to stare down upon this pressed button with a blank expression. Only to try another, Only to be given the same answer.

Wasn't until this boy had come across the more curious thing, Etched within the side of this wall sized box, had been a picture that looked like his coin. One that had been pointing towards the narrow gap left just off to the side. Fickle was this old coin that appeared within his palm without warning. Curious had been the staring of this silver eagle. Stare broken once it had been pressed into the awaiting slot. Thunks, clunks, and all manor of sounds echoed from deep within the bowels of this great big wooden box. The boy left to stand, to follow the sounds that crawled up from the bowels of this treat filled box.

Soft had been the sound of cracking ice, cracking that now appeared out of thin air, upon the glass that appeared all the same. How Jack's eyes had been left to slowly follow these cracks that worked up along the glass, to spread, to crack, to splinter across the wooden frame. What cries this box would make, of small hook filled fingers left to slowly break, How violent had been the vomiting of it's treasures, to fill the floor with piles of rainbow colored splendor.

From one pile a single bar the boy would take. To ignore the rest of what had been ill-gotten gains. No sooner had the boy stepped away had this now empty box collapsed beneath it's own weight, to come crashing down upon the wall it would face. To gouge the very brick that would not break, the fall it made. Rush of wind felt as it slammed, To send splintering pieces every which way, Just how much force had been needed for coins to become lodged within the ceiling of this place. For one to have strayed far enough to shatter the very mug a man in blue had been holding.

Colorful as a rainbow had been the language of all those that had been left stampeding. Towards the very source of this sudden, Chaos, Destruction. Only to find a kid, caught holding his bar of candy. Kid that had been left staring blankly up at all those that had been swearing, glaring. Yet none having been directed towards this boy.

""Which one of you was suppose to be watching the kid!"" one cried, while another howled. ""Wasn't it your job!"" A finger had been left to point. ""What about him! He hasn't been doing anything productive!"" Quick had been this group to be lost amongst heated yelling, name calling. ""What a god damn mess"" heard from one that had been left staring. ""We just got that thing too"" another looked as if he was about to cry.  ""Any of you idiots check on the kid!""

Quickly had been these men in blue to kneel and squat down around the boy, to check him not once, not twice, but thrice over for any harm he might of suffered. Knew not the weight lifted once they found not so much as a scratch had been left upon this boy. ""Thank God, He's all right.""

Jack had been left to stare upon each one of their faces as they had been searching, Vacant had been his expression as he knew not why they made such strange faces. Two officers left standing over what had been left of the metal that had once been their brand new, snack machine. ""Anyone got any idea how this happened?""

Angered had been the expression of one of these over worked, and exhausted men. ""We don't got time for this, We're already behind as it is, How soon till we can get rid of this damn kid?!""

Wide had been the eyes that stared up at this angered man. Upon the tips of his toe's the boy had been left to stand, reaching up with his candy bar, one he now tried to offer, to press against this angered man's lips. Candy bar that would be left slapped away from, and out of the boy's hand. One the boy had been left to stare upon the spot it now rest.

Unaware had this man been of the one called Frank. ""My office, Now!"" Thick had been the plume of smoke that escaped the chief's lips. For how quick anger had turned to fear of the one now lead off to the office of the other. One sided had been the muffled yelling that echoed from behind closed doors.

""Come on kiddo, Let's get you back to your seat, Parents should be by to pick you up once they find a way to get through all that snow.""

Hand gently pressed upon the boy's back, leading him towards the spot he usually sat. ""Why don't you stay put, And enjoy this nice donut you have sitting there.""

Jack having been handed the donut he had been unable to break the skin of with his teeth. Left to stare upon what had not been a treat. Some point during the time the boy had been left to stare, the other officers had returned to there usual work, Ignoring the mess that had been left in the hallway floor. Abrasive had been the voice the boy soon heard.

""The hell happened here"" Detective left to stare, as sweeter smoke hit the air. Tapping the ashes of his cigar into the ashtray of his desk, the boy sat. To snuff out the very life it once had, before pocketing what had been left of the cigar he had on hand.

Whatever thought, or interest The Detective had of this mess had been brief, as it had been with the yelling that came from the office. ""Let's go kid, We've got a long night ahead of us.""

One never knew just how bright the night could be, Beneath the full moon that now shine down upon the ice that encased the town. One knew not where streets would end, and side walks would begin beneath this endless blanket of white, beneath this not so dark night. Crisp air left to sting with the slightest breeze. Crunch of snow heard beneath The Detectives long overdue, and worn out shoes. Left pulling the toboggan the boy now sat.

Wrapped in an emergency blanket, the boy would stare down at the doughnut held between the mittens that served as his hand prisons. Left to listen to the echo of every step The Detective made, The only thing one would hear upon the crisp air this night. To be drowned out after a time by the echoing of The Detective's words.

""Think we need to put a leash and collar on you kid, Anytime we take our eyes off you, We end up having to send out a search party.""

""It would really help if you weren't so tight lipped about all these messes you keep ending up in.""

""Between you, and those spooks, Can't get a strait answer out of anyone these days.""

""Though I have to hand it to you kid, you really know how to grab the spot light, With how many people have started asking around about you.""

Long had been the pause The Detective gave. ""Got anything to say for yourself kiddo?""

Answer had come in the form of an offering, one that had been the doughnut he had been left holding.

""Kid I don't know who keeps giving you those, but the only use those things have is for decoration."" Taken now from between the boy's hands, to be tossed across what might of been a street. From beneath the sea of snow a great beast would leap, To snatch this discarded treat, To land atop the snow with a mighty, belly flop.

Wide eyed had been The Detective nearly given a heart attack, as he had been reaching for his gun. More colorful then a rainbow had been the string of words that echo through out the night. Rex left to pull the sled now that The Detective needed a moment to catch his breath. One not given, as he watched the canine dart off across this endless field that had been snow.

Another sleepless night of those that had been left waiting at the boy's home. Boy now left placed before the talking box, to listen to the stories it now told. Canine laying down beside him, trying to gnaw his way through the discarded thing that seemed not even he could manage to eat.

📻 *Ho ho ho Santa here, Hope all you good boys and girls are ready for all those gifts I'm going to leave!*

Moving of chairs heard from within the kitchen, His mother had been the first one to speak, sounding as if she had still been in shock. ""I was only cleaning for a few minutes, and he was gone.""

📻 *And for all those parents out there, Just remember Super-Mart will still be open to fill all your Christmas needs, this Christmas eve!*

His Father would be the next, exhausted was his tone. ""As I already told you before Dad, The gate was closed and still locked from the outside.""

♪ *He's the little boy that Santa Clause forgot* ♪

His old man eyeing him now, before looking off into the other room the boy had been sitting. ""Feels like I've been working twice as hard during this little vacation. Really got our hands full with this one""

♪ *And goodness knows he didn't want a lot* ♪

Clicking of the Radio heard now that his mother had come to carry him off to his usual nightly scrub. Left to stare at all the stains left in his regular pajamas. One his mother had been left to scrub clean within the bath the boy now sat. Distracted by all the bubbles the boy had once more been given to pop. Bubbles left to scatter now that Rex had decided to dive into the depths of soapy waters.

Both Fathers left mopping up the bathroom floor now that his mother had been tucking him in for what was left of the night. Canine left wagging his tail from beneath the bed he lay. Eager for his new friend to come out and play. Slow had been his mother to close the door, For the moment it had, the boy had been left to listen to the slower popping of stitches.

1qcbt81,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qcbt81/my_past_roommate_was_nuts_dont_be_like_me/,"My past roommate was nuts, don’t be like me!","Wanted to come on and tell my roommate story because Iv been free from her for months now.

Fun fact I originally posted about part of my situation on here and got called a bum… well now I don’t feel bad.

Back in the beginning of 2025 I was in a slumlord situation, ended up with mold poisoning because the landlord refused to fix a leak that caused mold all over the house. I basically got kicked out because I told the landlord that unless he fixed it I was going to turn it into a case. Lost my job that same month and was getting kicked out with no place to go and only about $400 to my name. I randomly went on my towns reddit and met a woman, 40s, who was in need of a roommate asap because her abusive ex was kicked out. We talked, she helped me move by getting a truck- let me pay off the first month in payments along with the next months rent. Over all she was extremely nice and I felt so in debt to her. 

I admit that I had two months while living with her I had slip ups, I was a week late on rent do to a bank issue and the she got pissed after I didn’t give her the last payment of $40 for that first months rent when she magically wanted it. 

I lived with here about 10 months, by the forth month she was treating me like shit. She told me that her lease was going to be up in October and she was moving with her daughter to another city. No problem, started working on getting myself options because I started a new job and had to save. 

Very quickly she started to get more and more nasty verbally. 

She became paranoid. She started to accuse me of stealing random things like light bulbs and opening her food. She got upset because I used toilet paper she left in MY bathroom from when I moved in, months after the fact. I used some of her coffee creamer which I offered to pay her back for- she blew up but then told me she actually bought me a container to be nice…turns out she laced it with stuff I was allergic too. Accused me of using her food stuff which she told me I could and then said she didn’t. 

She would corner me and cuss me out and tell me how much she hated me and never liked me and so on. That her abusive ex did more than I ever did. This would last from 20-30 minutes long multiple times a month.

After the whole almost poisoning me thing I knew I needed to get out and fast. One night I locked myself in my room and she had her friend over. The whole time I hear her talking shit about me, calling me a creep because I didn’t turn the light on in the kitchen at night ( her door was always open and I felt and so I wouldn’t turn the light on) telling her friend I was nasty because I ate my meals in my room. Because I wouldn’t come out to hang out with her (you can’t verbally harass and abuse someone and think they want to hang out with you). Find out that she lied about the lease being up and that it wasn’t going to be up until November and that she wasn’t even leaving.

My current roommate I found on facebook, helped me get a new place but sadly in the same apartment complex. My crazy ex roommate told me up and down that I would never be able to get an apartment here because of the requirements….well I did and it took less than three days. I had all my stuff out within three days- fully admit I didn’t pay that months rent because it was a few days into the month and i found out she wasn’t allowed to be renting me the room as is, I just needed a clean break. 

I had one last trip to get my stuff…she changed the locks on me. Acted paranoid over text saying “your playing a game with me and I’m not doing it” she waited another week that she wasn’t going to let me back into the apartment until I paid half the electric (she waited over a week just so the electric bill would come out) (this is where I came into Reddit’s because I didn’t know if she could legally lock me out and withhold my possessions over money- y’all are me up saying I was a bum for even questioning it) yeah well I did end up paying her…she then ghosted me for 5 days more and every day I sent her texts asking to at least put my stuff out if she wasn’t going to text me back a day and time to come pick up my items or clean. She texted back after 5 days to tell me “I know you’re trying to get out of cleaning and it won’t work your cleaning this shit up.” And “you’re not getting out of it and I have to be home because I’m not leaving you here alone” and threating to sue me if I didn’t clean…so hay if you don’t allow me back in by ghosting me with no instructions on a meet up, I can’t clean. She then sent me a picture of a bag of trash (no food just random garbage that I needed to take out since I was moving and cleaning the room before she locked me out) a picture of the rim of my toilet which was dirty, and proceeded to call me a “dirty bitch you nasty!!!” I ended up calling the police when she finally decided to give me a time and date to show up and she wanted to act like she was going to fight me the minute she opened the door but locked up when she realized I brought the cops. The room and bathroom were cleaned in less than 30 minutes and my stuff moved.

Never heard from her again.

That was until I almost ran into her a month later in the main office of our apartment building. She was trying to get someone (her daughter I believe) on the lease. I dipped before she saw me.

One day I was talking to one of the office girls who I have become really good friends with and I’m like “hey you know how I had that really bad roommate situation? Well I won’t get in trouble or the ex if I say I lived here before?” And she was like “nah I won’t say anything” and then she kinda laughed and was like “it would be some shit of if you said it was —-ex roommates name—“ and I just went wide eyed and nodded.

She then told me that apparently that same week her ex boyfriend, the “abusive” one that she kicked out, had showed up at the office to get his name taken off the lease. Turns out he was never take off the whole time I lived there for almost a year. He came in and the girl knew him form before he left, she ended up talking to him and he showed her texted and screen shots.

Apparently she was a cheater in the since that they where only together because she got him to cheat with her on HER FRIEND! Then it turned out that she wasn’t just verbally abusive to me but him as well and they had noise complaints about it, ultimately she verbally and physically abused him to the point he was thinking about taking his own life…he then found messages of hers on her phone where she was taking to people online (I guess these where the screenshots he showed the office girl) where she was telling people that she was purposefully wanting to drive him to self delete so he would do it on a special date (because apparently she thinks she’s a witch or something?) and it would clean her karmas or something… let that sink in.

A few weeks ago I started going to therapy, my therapist believes I actually developed a form of ptsd form living with this woman because of how verbal abuse and controlling she was of me because she knew I didn’t have any other option with my situation.

I don’t know what I can say, but just don’t be like me. Move out in your own if you can. If you move in with someone, at least try and get to know them for a while before moving in with them.

(I don’t need criticism on this anymore, I was very stupid and naïve during the whole situation. It is in the past and I’m in a better situation now.)",1,1768359354.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

This was to replace a Delonghi Magnifica S, about 10 years old and prior to that had another Delonghi.  So, a switch to Jura was unexpected.... but wow, so glad I did... granted it costs much more... but you get:

1. Better tasting cup of coffee and espressos when you compare with the Delonghi 
2. Use less beans and it tastes better; the bean hopper is small but adequate
3. So damn quiet -you can make a coffee in the middle of the night and not wake up your neighbors. 
4. Easier to add ground beans w/o making a mess.

1qcboku,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qcboku/aitah_for_asking_my_dad_what_his_freaking_problem/,AITAH for asking my dad what his freaking problem is with my girlfriend,"I’ve always had a great relationship with my father but lately it feels like he’s lost his freaking mind. It all started a few weeks before Christmas he asked for me and my girlfriends wish lists which my girlfriend provided and a few days after he has a talk with me about some things on there that he was confused about asking for some more fem leaning clothes (for context i have begun transitioning and told him in October and if im going to receive clothes for Christmas as i pretty much always have i would like them to lean more feminine so i can have something to experiment with my look more) his response is that it felt like she was trying to dictate how i look i told him no i wanted a few things to expand what I had available to experiment with changing my look,

a few days later he sent a text message saying that he was uncomfortable with my girlfriends expectations for her wish list she explained that she wasn’t expecting anything specific and that she just sent a full wish list including everything from something pink to she could use a new computer. His husband responded by saying that my father has trauma around gift giving and this has stressed him out that he has often felt like he had to buy peoples love. I can see where this would come from as my mother is quite materialistic but had never heard anything like this from him as long as I lived! It was explained that there were no expectations and whatever they got would be more than enough.

Next week i have been invited to coffee with my mom as she was in town. She asked me if I could come alone as she wanted some 1 on 1 time. When I got there I found both her and my dad waiting for me what followed was alot of questions about my transition i feel they could have asked me in private alot along the lines of why did you decide to transition medically before socially, have you thought about how this would impact your fertility, and have you considered violence in that your going from the most privileged group into the group with the highest likelihood of being targeted for a hate crime . (a line of questioning I largely consider to be of the same calibre as have you tried NOT being gay and … are you sure?) in addition to this he brings up my girlfriend again in her role on the night i came out, she encouraged me and gently nudged me into the position of come out and my dad considered this to be pressuring me to come out i explained to him that I needed a nudge because I have a tendency to just not address bigger things and dance around things (he brought this up on the night and I explained to him he brought it up again a week later and now it’s being brought up and explained again a third time) on top of the wish list incident he said that it seemed like i was “her little pet project” which I found incredibly insulting to both me and her

on top of this on another occasion she had been talking to my grandmother and my grandmother asking how I was doing and my girlfriend replied that i had been struggling a little bit with my mental health due to stress and according to my dad this stressed her out so much that she was apparently sobbing asking him to check in on me but when I talked to her directly she responded that she worries a bit but she wasn’t pulling her hair out or anything and seemed chill about everything and was confused about what my dad had said I don’t fully believe either of them 100% but I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle here

After this i called him a day after “coffee and talking ” and said straight up asking “what is the bug up your butt about my girlfriend?” “It feels like you are willing to at the drop of a hat assume the worst of her” this isn’t limited to just these incidents i feel like it’s been a consistent pattern of behaviour over the years and i feel it’s unfair to someone i love i feel he’s being uncharitable to her and after all these years she should have earned some benefit of the doubt. (Especially because if i were to be equally uncharitable i could easily say it looks like his husband is attempting to stir up drama in an effort to isolate him from the family) he got incredibly upset at this and I did not show up to the yuel dinner they were hosting. The intent was if this is intentional then you need to cut the shit and if it isn’t you need to do some soul searching and find what place emotionally this is coming from

I didn’t see or speak to them until Christmas where they effectively club snubbed us (not starting anything but very noticeably actively not interacting) including the end of the night where we were waiting alone and he continued more or less ignoring me

I sent them a thank you text after Christmas for their thoughtful gift and no response. I sent a new years message no response… four days later I get the response that their basically going no contact with us “i am stepping away and will not be communicating with you at this time i need space” and my stepdad writing “i too am stepping away and i no longer want to be referred to as dad” this is a big deal because when he got married to my dad there was a big fight between him and my sibling about them not wanting to call him dad for context my sibling has trauma due to our first step father abandoning us

So from my perspective it’s hard not to feel like this is possibly some kind of unconscious transphobia on my dad’s part and he’s projecting it onto my girlfriend especially with what he said during that talk

Aitah? Im wondering if I was too harsh when I confronted him about his attitude but how else should I act when I feel someone i love is being treated unfairly. Or he could be upset at me talking directly with my grandmother about what he said about her being stressed During “coffee” he and my mother told me that I should be treating my grandparents “like toddlers” and try to not confuse them or add to their stress while they’re “on their way out “ which feels disrespectful and unkind to me so maybe by talking to her directly he saw that as me disregarding his wishes?

I stride through city alleys, heart ablaze,
A rebel poet scripting dreams in midnight haze.
Chaos King, my words ignite the silent night,
Each line a spark, each sentence burning bright.

In vinyl glow and coffee’s warming steam,
I chase the pulse of life, I hunt the dream.
Author’s hand and camera’s watchful eye,
I capture truth where fleeting moments lie.

Yet tender beats beneath my leather skin,
A longing to be seen, a flame lit deep within.
I carry a found-friendship in laughter’s rome,
Where solitude dissolves, and every soul finds home.
Chaos King, I stand—both storm and calm,
A lover’s touch, a poet’s psalm.

In every roar of amp, in every whispered kiss,
I write my legend—pain and hope, and boundless bliss.",1,1768358657.0,u_No-Appearance602,0,1.0,False

Here's what I learned:

**General life tips:**

1. Choose a coach. Essentially this is anyone who can keep you accountable.
2. Avoid conflict by educating people around you about ADHD.
3. Listen to feedback from trusted others. Similarly, try to be more self-aware and practice self-awareness
4. Give yourself permission to be you and break free from conventional everything.
5. Establish external structure.
6. Make your environment in itself stimulating. If you fail again and again to maintain a routine or structure, make the routine and structure stimulating. One example is to try color coding or adding creativity/fun to whatever you do.
7. Understand the concept of O.H.I.O - only handle it once. Respond to things immediately. Do not have a to do pile or to do list of things to do later that can be done now. Whenever possible, tackle things immediately rather than putting them off.
8. Set yourself up for success. Create an environment that rewards you for doing the things you need to do.
9. Understand your limitations by expecting some level of ""failures"". Account for some percent of things that will inevitably not get done or not work out. Don't beat yourself up about it.
10. Always make deadlines.
11. Break down tasks into smaller tasks. Then give those sub-tasks sub-deadlines.
12. Become self-aware of when you learn best and the odd conditions that allow you to get things done.
13. It's okay to multi-task and often people with ADHD are better at doing multiple things at once. Talk on the phone while creating your plan for the day. Jog and plan your essay outline in your head.
14. Leave time for transitions. Understand that it takes us longer to switch between tasks.
15. Keep a notepad with you at all times
16. Set time aside every week/every day for doing something you enjoy doing or for ""wasting"".
17. Learn how to name your feelings and try ""I feel... because..."" statements.
18. Take a ""time out"". Exactly like children do.
19. Advocate for yourself and your needs.
20. Exercise regularly. Schedule it into your routine.
21. Schedule activities with friends. Set social deadlines. Have a social calendar.
22. Compliment others. Spend time noticing other people.
23. Keep things out. Visual cues are the strongest cues. Put things you need for work by the door. Keep papers that need to be handled on a bulletin board. Put your empty coffee mug out to remind you to start the coffee pot.
24. Make it fun. Every activity you don't like - make it fun instead.
25. Habit stacking - Once you get one habit going... add habits onto it to create a routine. (ie. In the morning you normally get coffee, get dressed, and leave. If you want to add daily planning, then add the habit ""After I get my coffee, I will sit down at my desk and plan my day for five minutes. After planning, I will get dressed and leave."")
26. Know what times of day your biological clock works. Night owls do things at night; early birds accomplish things in the morning.
27. Use technology to get smart with the way you do things. Be creative with solutions. Stop doing things the hard way and let computers do it for you. Don't be afraid to use kids stuff to solve your problems.
28. Similarly, stop doing things you don't need to and ask for help. Learn to delegate things to people that are trusted and able to help.
29. Become friends with defeat and failure. Stop beating yourself up over failing.
30. Learn to say no. Stop over-committing.
