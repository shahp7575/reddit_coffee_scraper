I have a 2.36 hdl/ldl ratio. Hdl 61, ldl 143. I’m fit and climb two to three times a week. I’ve been an athlete my entire life - wrestled for almost ten years till I was 23 and ran cross country in high school and stayed in great shape ever since. I stopped doing cardio so I’m going to be reincorporating that three times a week. I was worried about my Bp just a couple of months ago, but I got on lisinopril and it is now normal numbers, and the cardio definitely lowers to great numbers. Now I’ve got to target my cholesterol. 

I went to my pcp after seeing my cholesterol and he wants to put me on statins because he doesn’t think I can do much more considering my age and fitness level. He says it’s just genetic. I asked if I could see a cardiologist at least and give me three months. My diet has never been terrible but I’ve never tried to lower saturated fat or consume a large amount of fiber. Btw, I quit all substances four years ago (tobacco, alcohol, weed, even coffee). The only thing I know to do is be consistent with cardio and watch my saturated fat intake while increasing my fiber. 

What’s y’all’s thoughts? I’m not sure if I should give in and take the statins in three months if my ldl is still high. Or do y’all agree with my pcp and believe I can’t do much more? ",1,1739830108.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

However, I’ve read that the La Pavoni is an difficult machine, and many people advise against it. Still, I want to get one because I consider it a work of art in terms of design and history.

I have a budget that allows me to choose between two models. I’m torn between a Europiccola from Coffee Sensor, which comes with some mods like a Bong insulator and a group head pressure gauge, or a brand-new Stradivari without any mods.

Personally, I find the Stradivari much more beautiful. However, that would mean no mods. I won’t be installing mods myself—except for the Bong insulator, which I might manage. I’m not handy at all when it comes to tinkering, so modifying it myself is not an option.

What would you recommend? A Europiccola with mods from Coffee Sensor or a standard Stradivari, which I find much more aesthetically pleasing?

I knew I didn’t believe in anything ever since I was little, I’m 14 now. It might seem good that I was able to understand that there’s no afterlife, but in reality, figuring something like that out at such a young age is so difficult and painful. It started off mild, only some panic attacks about it a few nights here and there, but as I got older it progressed to full blown psychotic breakdowns followed up with derealization. I would make up scenarios in my head about anything death related, I’d just imagine myself simply not there somehow and I’d freak out and rip my hair, grip my skin really hard, hit my head, kick myself, bite myself and more. I’m currently at my lowest. I don’t know why I can’t find anything that comforts me and stops these thoughts anymore like I used to do when I was younger. Recently I’ve started imagining how in 50+ years my family will be completely different and most people would be dead. This is just an example. I feel like I’m anticipating my end, and the end of my loved ones, not to mention that I’m nobody in this world, just some stranger you won’t even look at when they pass you by, one day I’ll die and not a single person will notice, they’ll walk their dog like usual, get up and drink their coffee, turn on the tv, or go shower. But I won’t. I started having suicidal thoughts recently. I don’t know why I’m having thoughts about something that completely contradicts my fear. I feel bad for ever being put on this earth and having to suffer like this in the first place, if I could, I would’ve erased myself before I could exist.
If you’re reading this please help me. I don’t know what to do with myself or who to turn to, I don’t want to leave my family behind in the future, but I don’t want the burden of it either. I can’t even inform my loved ones since they know exactly what I’m going  my through but refuse to get me help, and talking to them about it will change nothing. I don’t even think I’m an existentialist anymore, I see no point in life at all and I don’t understand why. I also don’t understand why I can’t find help in real life anywhere, why is something inevitable that happens to everyone, not talked about at all? Please help me.",1,1739829941.0,atheism,0,1.0,False
1irwbht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/1irwbht/costco_travel_review_long_and_detailed_hotel/,Costco Travel review (LONG AND DETAILED): Hotel Xcaret Mexico,"Hello friends! I recently traveled to Hotel Xcaret Mexico via Costco travel. No issues at all on Costco's end (they were actually extremely helpful very quickly when we decided to leave a day early!), just wanted to share my experience at this resort, in this sub, as I feel quite strongly that this company has fake trip advisor reviews, buys bots, polices their social media, etc..... I did review on Costco's website as well but obviously couldn't' include MOST of the details lol (sorry in advance for the longest review ever), but more than anything I feel obligated to share/forewarn others as I'm sure there are many of us who appreciate the baseline sense of confidence we can have when purchasing or booking things via Costco, as most if not all of their brands are pretty reputable. Anyway! I've copy-pasted my trip advisor review below, and am happy to answer any specific questions or give more info on anything else. 

**TRIP ADVISOR REVIEW:** 

Disclaimers:

1. I’ve traveled to many all-inclusives in many parts of the Caribbean & Mexico, ranging from 3-5 stars, I know what to expect (both good, bad, and sometimes just odd!) This review is not written from someone who doesn’t “get it” or has unrealistic expectations.
2. I am not an entitled complainer who uses vacations like these as an excuse to treat others like my personal servant for the week. I add this note because I personally sift through the 1 star reviews that are clearly written by people who make it their mission to find things to complain about. This review is not that situation and I would never behave like those people, no matter how horrible the experience.

With that being said….

TLDR: This resort is nothing short of a sham operation from top to bottom. 100% of staff is aware of what they are doing and almost appear arrogant that they’ve successfully tricked you. They are advertised and priced as pure luxury while providing an experience of a very sub par (3 star or lower) all inclusive at BEST. This was by far the worst all inclusive I’ve stayed at in my life while simultaneously being the most expensive. The low level of service & quality of food/products/information are not mistakes or due to understaffing, one-off situations, etc… it is clear, intentional planning to deliver a completely different experience than the guest is expecting, as they are aware of how well they are rated on all travel & social media platforms. I have theories on how these ratings are being obtained, but for now, save your money & stay anywhere else.

Long Version:

I did extensive research on multiple platforms before deciding on Xcaret and was genuinely excited to experience what I thought would be one of the most relaxing & luxurious vacations of my life. Instead we endured a week of odd behaviors, dismissive service, confusing rules, and truly horrible food among other things. I firmly believe this resort is intentionally and knowingly taking advantage of their guests in every single way possible. First and foremost, their exclusive goal is to sell people on their memberships/timeshares. I know this is common at resorts like these, but the difference here is how often and how pushy they are, combined with how differently they treat you once you decline these “offers”. You literally can’t do or ask anything to any front desk/concierge person without them somehow trying to vaguely sell you something.

The resort itself is beautiful and modern and appears to be awesome - but it’s HUGE and can take quite a while to walk the entire thing. All if not most paths are covered in tall greenery. Directions around the resort are confusing and non-existent, almost like they want you to spend countless hours lost not knowing where to go. Staff doesn’t even say hello when passing let alone offer to help navigate you. We were essentially in a corn maze for a week against our will. Rules/policies are purposely misleading or confusing to deter you from utilizing some of the “perks” that are already included & paid for. There are SO many attempts at every turn to “upgrade” you to things while being incredibly resistant to share tangible information on the difference in experience and prices attached to that upgrade. When you start to catch onto what’s happening, the staff becomes dismissive and even less interested in helping than before. Odd things happened throughout the week and escalated the more I questioned the nonsensical policies or overall rude behavior. We almost felt like we were being watched or notes written each time we gave our name for reservations or anything.

The food is truly horrendous, and I’ve had some pretty low quality all-inclusive food in my day. All buffets have the same exact items as each other— which are odd combinations (apples covered in cheese sauce?), displayed messily, sitting out all day, etc. I’ve had better food with better displays at 3-star or lower resorts. Food hygiene practices by staff IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE were truly alarming, I don’t even want to think about what happens in back of house. All of the menu & menu items for different restaurants on the app genuinely do not exist and staff doesn’t know what you’re talking about if you ask about them. Of course, the specialty restraints reservations are mysteriously unavailable so you’re forced to eat at the buffet for 99% of meals. I was physically standing right in front of the taco cook as she left for over 15 minutes with a line of people in front of her, returning with 1 bag of tortillas (okay, she clearly took a break lol whatever)… Zero acknowledgement that we’ve all been standing there mid meat-cook for 15-20 minutes. Proceeds to walk away again, grab a bag with a several pound slab of beef and a quart of meat juices in it, whips the huge slab of raw beef onto the cook top along with all of our meats & tortillas - all juices are leaking on everything. No, she does not wash or even WIPE her hands off on a towel during this entire exchange. Zero regard for food safety or even pretending she cares about cross contamination. By the time I sat down to eat THIRTY MINUTES LATER I was scolded that lunch was ending soon…… cool! Water that was provided was delivered to our rooms daily in glass bottles with beer bottle-type caps just resting (not sealed or closed in any way) on top of the bottles. All other things considered — there is absolutely no way these bottles are being sanitized appropriately. I am not the person who’s sounding the alarm on not drinking the water/ice at these resorts, but the safety practices were so openly bad I actually woke up one night in a panic attack worrying when I’d get sick (For the record I did NOT get sick - I truly feel this was my only luck of the trip).

The rooms are tidied by housekeeping but are not cleaned well if at all. Our balcony stone tub (which we paid more for the upgrade) wouldn’t drain, nobody tended to it, and my husband actually ended up with an infection in the worst place possible by the end of the week. We tried countless times to call the front desk (once for luggage pick up, once when our hot water broke, once when housekeeping ignored my note for coffee k-cups), they legitimately did not answer the phone any of these times over the course of 5-15 minutes ranging to 2 hours. We had to walk up to the front each time for these things & asked if their phones were down and were dismissed like we were crazy each time. I cannot emphasize enough that every member of this team KNOWS that they are scamming you out of a 5 star experience and knows how much money you dropped only to feel uncomfortable and confused the entire time.

We were in building Agua which we were told (by 3 different people at different times) that the spa hydrotherapy was included, which we were very excited about. We went down to the spa to check it out - only to be told we weren’t allowed to look at it (it’s a wide open space right in front of our faces… I can see it right now? Why am I not allowed to take 1 more step forward and see the pano view?) for privacy of their guests (nobody was in there, again - I can see it from where I’m standing lol) and we need to BOOK hydrotherapy (essentially a hot tub) 24 hours in advance. FWIW the spa is physically beautiful and appears awesome. I’ve been to many luxurious and non luxurious spas and I’ve quite literally never been refused to LOOK at a spa that I’m deciding to drop hundreds of dollars in and again - the policy - I could completely understand if they were full and “recommend” you try to book a slot to avoid being turned away. The hot/warm tubs were EMPTY. Why do you need 24 hours notice? I questioned this policy with both the spa staff and concierge who were on the verge of being hostile with me while refusing to give any tangible reason why I’d need to give so much notice to go chill in a hot tub or sauna. When we finally got to utilized this “included” benefit, we were quite literally policed by the staff room to room (sauna to steam to cold to hot to warm) every 2-3 minutes and then taken out of the warm tub and sat in chairs. I couldn’t use the restroom without the staff member actually SPRINTING to me demanding to know where I was going. Again, I am a spa veteran and never have I ever been timed or monitored at all through a hydrotherapy experience… let alone for only 2-3 minutes at a time and again, an empty spa. Nobody was waiting behind me to use anything. When we were finished being rushed through hydro and stared down while trying to relax, they asked if we wanted to keep the other hydro reservation we had for later in the week and when we said yes, all of a sudden the rule changed to “only one hydro is included the rest are an additional fee”. Of course it is….. we did not return to the spa at all due to such a weird and uncomfortable experience, which was a bummer as we typically love to do a full spa day while on vacations like these.

Essentially, every single experience or situation was similar to the spa or the taco cook. I can count on one hand the staff members who were kind and helpful, which was so appreciated as we stumbled through the week becoming more confused and dumbfounded at the practices and behaviors.

The cherry on top of this disaster of a resort was that the weather was HORRIBLE the entire time (not the hotels fault of course!!) and we were so bored and miserable the whole week that we decided to leave a day early. I approached the front desk to inquire about anything needed from me (in person of course as they don’t answer the phones :) ) and was told I’d need to sign a paper that I was leaving early, which I was fine with and understood, only to actually go through check out the next day and be presented with the most strongly/weirdly worded arbitration agreement I’ve ever seen in my life. It had absolutely nothing to do with leaving early (not that anyone cared to ask why we were leaving early anyway but that’s okay!) and was all about removing them from any and all liabilities / damages / sicknesses / etc???? Never in my entire life have I been presented a document like this upon checkout of a resort or hotel, or for any situation — and NEVER in such strong language. It was jarring to read and even more jarring when multiple people tried to intimidate me into signing it. I’m thankful I thought to capture a photo of this document in its entirety and am happy to share with anyone interested. The cherry on top of the cherry was the final attempt at selling us on their “membership” (while still not asking why we were leaving early LMAO and the entire desk team staring me down, per usual) as we’re waiting for our driver. I’ve never been happier to leave a vacation in my life and get into the neutral ground that was the airport. I truly felt like we were in the movie “get out” or white lotus (minus the luxury part, of course). I actually did not realize the amount of anxiety I had and discomfort we were feeling until we were off the property & I am thankful we had third party transportation booked through Costco.

At the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist: I have several differing theories on how this resort is able to obtain SO MANY 5 star absolutely GLOWING reviews. All I can say is this: 1. it is worth it to filter out only 1-2 star reviews and READ them. 2. Look closer at the 5 stars & compare how long that person’s profile has existed vs. when they supposedly traveled to this resort. 3. Note the resort’s responses to bad reviews and their lack of accountability or tangible follow up on guests’ specific issues (even those that are cost/refund related).

My final note: I understand that all-inclusives and vacations in general are subjective to each individual on how bad or good they are… but— after our trip, I actually took the time to cross-compare the price of xcaret vs. two other resorts I’ve recently stayed at in cancun/surrounding areas-- same week & same amount of days for all three places. Resort 1 was 2300 pp. Resort 2 was 3300 pp. Xcaret was almost 4500 pp. Through Costco it brought it down to 7700 total, which in retrospect, was probably why I was so excited to ""get a deal"" for such a ""luxurious place"" even though it was by far much more money than I've spent on previous trips.

Regardless of differing opinions on food & service or anything else, this resort is absolutely NOT worth double or triple the cost of other awesome resorts that I’d happily stay at again (that are rated the same if not worse than xcaret!!). Xcaret is not a 3 star resort let alone 5 star luxury in any way shape or form. Save your money and stay literally anywhere else for half the cost.",1,1739829916.0,Costco,1,1.0,False

BUT. i have NOOOOOO WHERREEE TO LIVEEEEE IN THIS CIIITTTYYY BY APRIL. i am moving in april. there's no ifs about it and it has to happen is all i can say. theres absolutely no chance that i will be able to stay in this city let alone this store beyond april.

and i can not afford to quit. so please dont offer me that option. to be short and cut to the chase, i have a couple ideas for plans but i need some help dissecting them:

1. Q: If another district wants me, knowing about my final and not caring about it, can my current DM stop me from leaving?

I know that transfers go through DMs. But if a DM in a district I've previously worked in WANTS me, despite the final, and I want to go, and a store manager wants me, and the conditions are so bad that not transferring risks my job/housing, can my current DM really do anything about it? Can they really say no to that? Can a recieving DM override the sending DM? I've seen this happen with SMs before.

2. Q. I've been considering a mental health LOA recently (for stress induced panic attatcks and insomnia triggered by workplace stress and gried in my personal life) and was thinking I could probably use that to my advantage. If I go on say a 2-3 month LOA, and within that time I move, can I..weaponize..my LOA as a means to force my DM to trasnfer me?

I know Starbucks doesn't want to fiddle with the legalities of that. A partner goes on a mental health leave of absence and returns to be forced into a possibly unsafe housing environment--not a good look. Also, hopefully, given that I am the only opening and closing barista on certain days, they will be FORCED to replace me, I'm hoping that they wont have room for me to come back and will be willing to transfer me because of it.  

3. Can I file a transfer over my DM's head, possibly through Partner Relations/PCC, with the reasoning that I literally don't have anywhere to live if I don't transfer?

  
TLDR: I am a loyal and reliable partner. If not the beginning text, please respond to the 3 questions if possible!!

I live for random adventures of all kinds like road trips, photo-op hikes, camping, trying out new restaurants or coffee shops, etc. I’m a huge nerd, especially when it comics to graphic novels and sci-fi.

For a living, I’m a photographer and videographer. So I do a lot of photo and video shoots and editing. And graphic design. And IT. I’m a jack of all trades really. In my free time, I like going to haunted places and doing overnight stays. I love all things spooky and supernatural. Also space/scifi. I love reading I just picked up several new graphic novels and im excited to dive in. And I love photography. So I like to go on adventures just to get great photos!

Now here I am pissed off, confused and in some serious denial. 

Here’s some backstory, me F23 and Alex F23 have been best friends since junior year of high school. Alex got me through some hard times at the beginning of our friendship and she was also there to see the beginning of me and my now fiancé’s M22 relationship. We went through a lot, especially through Covid. We graduated 2020 so our senior year was kind of weird, but we still spent a lot of time together. We worked the same job for a couple years along with her older sister Aya F25. 

we were very close so when she asked me to go on a birthday trip with her, Aya and their boyfriends, I gladly said yes. I had ended up going on this trip without my then boyfriend because he had a job where he wasn’t able to get enough time off work to take the trip. I still went though because I wanted to spend time with her and celebrate her birthday after 2 years of not being able to.  this birthday trip was taking place in January 2022 to Seattle, Washington. before going on this trip, I knew I was going to be the only “single” person so I had already prepped myself because I would not be able to hang out with her the whole time. I didn’t want to be weird and third wheel every second. We had a rough start to Seattle because our first flight from San Antonio, Texas to Houston got canceled. The flight was supposed to be in the morning, but we found out the night before that it got canceled so we all quickly gathered together and hauled ass in a car to Houston at 12 o’clock at night. We didn’t get much sleep that because by the time we got to the airport hotel it was about four in the morning and our flight was supposed to takeoff at like six or seven. 

all this happened so I was in a completely different airport than I regularly flew out of the ,San Antonio airport’ so when we pulled up to check our bags, I was totally lost and had no clue where I was and I got left behind by everyone else in this huge craze to get to our gate. The reason the story is relevant is because I should have known it was the first glimpse of how this trip would be. We had only been together for about 10 hours and I already got left behind. We ended up back together in the security checkpoint line. I was a dozen people behind them and just made them wait outside of security for me. 

I won’t go into too much detail, but this entire trip there was quite a few times I was left behind because I was the only single person there. We were sleeping in an Airbnb that only had two bedroom and a couch that was a pull out so obviously I slept on the couch while the couples each got a room which I was totally OK with. I understood that stuff like that would happen. what I didn’t know would come was that every time we would come back at the end of the day from whatever we were doing in the city all four of them would go to their rooms shut the door and leave me in the common area by myself everynight. I literally had to listen to them, laughing, giggling with each other, which sucked. 
Another time everyone wanted to ride the Ferris wheel, but of course each cart only carried four people, but there was five in our group. I literally sat out while they were on the Ferris wheel together.

About two days before I was supposed to leave I reached out to alex through text late one night because I wanted to tell her how I was feeling without making a big deal about it in front of her boyfriend or anyone else that we were with. I basically said in this text that I was sad about being left out and I was there to celebrate with her and I wanted to be a little more involved with everyone because it had been a sad trip for me. I tried not to be aggressive in this text message. I just wanted to be level with her and honest as I thought I could because she was my best friend. She had already fallen asleep by the time I sent the message, it was probably about two in the morning when I sent it, so I just fell asleep. since I was sleeping in the common area, literally 5 feet away from the kitchen. The first thing she did when she woke up was make a pot of coffee. I had been awake sitting on my phone and I didn’t want it to be awkward or too forward about the text message so I waited for her to say something. She walked right past me back to her room, closed the door and my stomach dropped. I waited for her to come back out alone and asked her if she had anything to say about the text message that I sent her and without looking at me, she said she didn’t wanna talk about it. so I didn’t say anything and just started getting ready for the day, but while I was putting on my make up, I began to fester with anger, and I started throwing a fit. not necessarily saying anything about what had happened between us, but my attitude definitely changed. I was a little louder when I was saying something and just being extra. I will admit I was a bitch. 

We finally finished our trip and headed home on a flight to Houston and drove back because of the whole situation that happened at the beginning of the trip. we didn’t end up getting home until one or two in the morning, but I told my boyfriend he had to come pick me up because if I had to sleep with them one more night I might rip my hair out. He understood and was there as soon as we showed up. I didn’t say a single word to anyone when I left. 

I didn’t talk to Alex for six months after that trip, but I missed her a lot and I was the one who reached out to ask her if she would meet up for at my favorite coffee shop I received what I now see as a half assed apology but back then I was OK with it because I missed her. fast-forward to the end of the year she was planning another trip to Nashville this time for her birthday. she invited me, but I told her no.
I havnt seen Alex but one time since 2023 and it was on accident. I ran into her at the same coffee shop. I still have the birthday gift from 2023 that I was supposed to give her. It’s a journal that I now write in about her. I’ve called her and text her casually but would rarely received anything back. I invited her places, asked her to tell me when she would be in town because she was going to college in corpus. every time I tried to be involved with her I ended up disappointed for two whole years.

Anyways, there I was on February 5, 2025 three weeks away from getting married. when I received a text message from Alex letting me know that she was thinking of me and hoping I was having fun wedding planning. I didn’t answer the text message because I was exhausted of how back-and-forth things have been with her for the past couple years we’ve had a lot of downs. More that I plan on mentioning because it might just bite me in the ass.
Then a week later, she messaged me again, asking me for my wedding RSVP information because she didn’t receive my save the date or my invitation. Here’s some tea she doesn’t know, I did not send her an invitation. We had this weird argument back in November 2024 and I guess that’s really when I declared myself tired of her. I ended up, blocking her on everything except text and basically ghosting her. So here’s my question, did she not notice that I blocked her? this girl was obsessed with her sleuthing Instagram abilities. She had to have noticed. so to me, the text message of her saying she didn’t receive the save the date or the invitation was her pulling at straws to  stay in my life and get me to explain myself to her. This girl had been playing with me for years, and it took me so long to see it because I thought she could never do that to me. so I finally whipped out the text message I had been saving for her in my notes and sent it to her. it basically sums up how I felt for a couple of years and I told her not to message me but that wasn’t clear enough for her. she took about an hour to respond, and the text was full of lies and gaslighting. 

All the texting took place while I was at work, I have a big mouth couldn’t help but tell my coworker what was going on  basically crashed out on the clock. I was genuinely convinced about everything She said in the text message. took me all day to come to my senses and realize that these are just tactics that she’s been using on me for years. 

So, have I been crazy and over exaggerating the past couple years or am I in the right to not have her at my wedding?",1,1739829159.0,TwoHotTakes,5,1.0,False

I am normal weight and not trying to lose weight. I am now in my 40s and I cannot eat the way I was able to when I was younger. I could eat absolutely anything and any amount of food then and it felt like nothing. Now I feel like I have to be very careful and mindful of what I eat. But I find that I am becoming aware that I eat a lot of food, and mostly out of boredom or just habit/routine. I will have my coffees every day whether I feel like it or not. I have dessert every night, even though I probably shouldn’t because I am not hungry after dinner. I can eat a full meal and be completely stuffed, and two hours later have a snack or more food just for the sake of eating. I also notice that most of my snacks are really high fat and I cannot stop loading up my food because it’s so delicious. For example, my morning oatmeal will have oatmeal, chia seeds, prunes, berries, cashews, almonds. I’m sure that’s totally overdoing it but I keep having it like that. Same thing with yogurt.

**E01 - Soiree in the Swamp**

Season starts with a huge challenge - make a dish featuring a Louisiana delicacy - alligator, frog or turtle! The ones not used to exotic ingredients struggled a bit, but the french trained were happy to see frog. Having eaten all 3 let's just say ""tastes like chicken"" would apply. Guests gave Mardi Gras Beads!! Nina won with curried turtle meatball, okay I would eat that, Ramon went home.

**E02 - Rebuilding New Orleans**

I knew it, a Gumbo Challenge! Oh man they stayed up all night and it still wasn't good enough for some of them. Carrie came out on top in both the quickfire and the elimination Food Truck Challenge. That looked so stressful, and yet ... I was immediately tempted with the idea of watching the Great Food Truck Race.

**E03 - Commander's Palace**

Shirley wins the Quickfire with Congee! Oh my, now I am craving some comfort food. Speaking as someone who has eaten a lot of it, Congee is one of those dishes that is easy to make, but hard to make well. All fairness aside, there's something very special about Mom's congee.

The replicating classic dishes from Commander's Palace elimination challenge was quite blah in comparison, I will probably not remember the winner (Justin) or guy who went home (Bret).

**E04 - Captain Vietnam**

Time to highlight Louisiana's shrimping industry! I'm thinking Bubba Gump boat but the challenge is for a  Vietnamese influence. Shirley's background is a huge asset, her Vietnamese / Creole fusion french Barbecue Shrimp was smart and looked mouth watering, she won. At this point I'm concluding this woman is one to watch.

**E05 - Lea Michele's Halloween Bash**

LMAO the Judges Shopped and every ingredient and utensil was wrapped in Aluminium foil! I pictured the cast hiring their kids to do the wrapping ""it'll be fun! I'll pay you $xxx!!"" Heck I'd do it for free. That was hilarious. Padma's team won and they got to split $10,000. Thanks Padma and Reynolds Wrap! That will buy a ton of aluminum foil.

Another fun challenge. I haven't watched Glee so I know nothing about Lea Michele besides she's a good singer, and got a ton of online hate for stuff? Gosh how does one get to being a guest that can eat top chef food?? HELP! Actually love challenges with creativity. Carlos and Travis' Dia De Los Murtos was a deserving winner. Sorry Michael.

**E06 - Campfires, Cream Cheese and Countryside**

TIL Creole Tomatoes exist. Do they really taste different? Nina's chilled soup won, her passion for elevating local food and her warm personality are growing on me. Is it me or does John Besh's face looks almost plastic like they photo shopped it or as folks say these days ""used a filter??"" Emeril looks natural but Besh is like a mannequin almost? Do celebrity chefs also fall prey to ""you must look good here's a face lift and $10,000 cream?""

Elimination challenge features farm fresh ingredients and Philadelphia Cream Cheese, my favorite and a diet killer but it's better than other brands, fight me. Nina wins again, where can I find me some Zucchini Blossoms and Eggplant? Bene's bland chicken was as unmemorable as him, he went home.

**E07 - Jazz Hands**

An aptly named episode as chefs had to rotate and improvise for a musical chairs quickfire. Brian won! The quickfire guest judge is Jazz Trumpter Kermit Ruffins, who is host of the elimination ""Potluck Party."" Musicians really know how to use their words, they were as opinionated as the judges! Based on the Guest's impressions, I felt like the food was kind of meh, to be honest, though Stephanie won.

**E08 - Piggin' Out**

Loved the make your own hot sauce Quickfire that Brian won! Okay I would buy his Jalapeno, Serrano, Lime, Yuzu hot sauce, that would go with pretty much anything especially seafood. Now the title of this episode is Piggin' Out, so elimination is a Cajun Boucherie communal slaughtering, y'all each get a part of the pig and make something. Given that a whole pig died I was mostly underwhelmed by the food. Carlos Won, Louis gone.

**E09 - Restaurant Wars**

My favorite but this time in teams of 5??! My god, more people, more drama!! At least the food looked mostly good, service is a different thing though. Nicholas kept his cool and was a deserving winner with Sara going home.

**E10 - Like Mama Made**

Quickfire is to make a dish featuring sponsor Dunkin Donuts Coffee, winner Shirley walked away with $10,000. For that money I will make coffee crusted something with cream cheese covered in Reynolds Wrap and hope to win $30,000. Okay I am cheap. Oh elimination is a dish that reminds them of home. My sentimental heart is all going ""aww"" at each dish. Nicholas won, was sad to see Travis go.

**E11 - Giving it the College Try**

Was mentally taking many notes during the Drumsticks Quickfire since some of them look okay for a home cook to try cooking. However would not attempt Carrie's winning Squab due to lack of Juniper and Fig Mostarda. Elimination is to serve college students at Louisiana State University, many went a bit too elevated for college kids tastes. Shirley had a deserved victory with Roast Beef, Potatoes and Tomatoes - simple, relevant, delicious. She now has a Toyota car to go with the $10K, must be nice.

**E12 - Mississippi Mud Bugs**

Whoop there it is, the Crawfish Challenge, Quickfire is Crawfish Etouffee. I thought Nina would win, but Shirley's Singapore Chili Crab was too delicious (would 100% eat). The seafood elimination was okay, felt this was a step down from the exciting Quickfire. Stephanie's fried Oysters came out on top, Carrie's flounder croquettes sent her home.

**E13 - Oui Si A Challenge**

Quickfire is to replicate a dish by Jacques Pepin! OMG the poor chefs without classical french training must have been quaking, I mean, it's Jacquest Pepin. Nicholas won showcasing his technique. Elimination is the dreaded team challenge. French vs. Spanish tasting menus. Spanish team came out on top, Nina won, Stephanie gone.

**E14 - Po' Boy Smackdown**

Yay a Po' Boy Gourmet Quickfire challenge! I expected way more creativity. Catfish + Mirin = win for Shirley, it looked like the tastiest Po' Boy in the bunch. Expected to be seriously wowed by dishes representing each cheftestant's culinary voice found during a turning point. Most seemed meh, Shirley won again. Right now just hoping she makes the finale.

**E15 - Leaving New Orleans**

Bitter sweet episode. Carlos won the car during the quickfire, but went home on the elimination challenge. At least he has a vehicle to drive off into the sunset!

**E16 - Maui Wowie**

Who else was taking notes during the spam challenge thinking ""I can make that?"" As it progressed, not so easy. Nicholas won with creative use of the ingredient. This guy did his homework like crazy, if that is the level of his commitment no wonder he won the Elimination. Louis and Shirley (NOOO!) are out!

**E17 - Finale**

Time for a great 4 course meal. Halfway through I started getting worried. God dammit Nina, cook from your heart! Don't listen to your sous chef Stephanie with the the Sous Vide!! OH NO it's like a train wreck playing out IRL. Nina is doomed! NOOO!

The problem is Nicholas is very hard working, he's got creativity and technique to spare. Nina didn't cook from her heart, and that cost her the finale despite me pulling for her to win after Shirley's elimination. This might be one of the saddest finale's I've watched, I'm still hurting for Nina.

**Final Thoughts**

* The production crew did a great job highlighting New Orleans' rich, diverse food culture. We got all the usual suspects - swamp ingredients, alligator, frog, tons of seafood, crawfish, oysters, shrimp etoufee, po boy, etc. I was really expecting more corn cake hush puppies and beignets, and maybe a Hurricane challenge.
* Food wise, not the best season I've seen (thus far)
* Judging wise, Emeril came across like some nice uncle coaching the chefs. 
* Nicholas was competent throughout, he's not the most exciting to watch but he makes good food with great technique.
* Personally was pulling for Nina and Shirley, but Nina made some bad decisions in the finale.",1,1739828855.0,TopChef,0,1.0,False

On top of that, I had a slip and fall on ice 6 years ago where I broke a bone in my dominant hand, which was simply awful as a single mom. 

Today I took my kids (11 and 13) to the local ice rink and paid for them to skate while I drank my coffee. After I finished my coffee, I decided to rent skates and join my kids on the ice. I haven’t skated since high school. I looked like Bambi at first and was terrified of falling. My feet and ankles hurt so much but surprisingly my muscle memory came back pretty quickly and before I knew it I was giving my kids pointers on what to do. My oldest thanked me genuinely for the fun outing and especially for joining them.

I’m sure I’ll be feeling it in the morning, but the joy my kids showed at having me out there with them along with the positive association with moving my body for fun were both completely worth it. ",12,1739828828.0,CongratsLikeImFive,2,1.0,False

1irvukj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1irvukj/creepy_true_thanksgiving_story/,Creepy true thanksgiving story,"This is a story told to me by my roommate. It happened 3 years ago in 2022. It was the week of thanksgiving, and my daughters boyfriend had invited me and my daughters over to his families house in Connecticut to spend thanksgiving there. There wasn’t much space in the house so me and my daughters had to stay in the basement. The only people who lived in the house besides my daughters boyfriend, were his grandmother, his sister and her husband. A few more family members were suppose to be staying over as well but since we came late that night, I didn’t get to meet any of them. We stayed the first night in the house, and it was finally the morning of thanksgiving. I normally wake up pretty early so I was up by 7am. I was the only one awake in the house. I went upstairs to the kitchen and sat on a high chair. I sat for a bit just drinking some coffee and relaxing before the day began. As I was drinking my coffee, I saw a cute little boy coming downstairs. He was in his pajamas and came downstairs to the fridge to get something to drink. I smiled at him and watched him go back upstairs. I remember thinking about how adorable he was. Well later that day, everyone got ready and went into the kitchen and living room as we began our thanksgiving celebration. Everybody was together having a great time, and that’s when I decided to ask out loud, “Hey where’s the cute little boy that I saw earlier this morning?” .. I was instantly pulled aside by the grandma. She looked at me in shock and says, “Shh, careful my daughter doesn’t hear you. Her son died in front of this house a few years ago. He got hit by a car. I see him too sometimes but nobody believes me..”My heart instantly dropped. I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. After hearing that, I couldn’t help but have a weird feeling the rest of the time I was in that house. Later that night, my daughter and her boyfriend went upstairs to get some yogurt from the fridge. She specifically remembered grabbing a strawberry yogurt and putting back a banana yogurt she had grabbed. As they headed back downstairs to the basement, their hearts dropped as they noticed that the banana yogurt was placed on their bed.. We felt super uneasy after this.Thankfully we ended up going home the next day. But I’ll never forget how crazy these 2 days were. Hopefully we won’t have to go back anytime soon.",3,1739828766.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

I'm taking my Adderall pretty regularly now. I have days where I forget to take it or by the time I can take it, it's too late in the day and I don't want to take it at 3:30 pm. 

Anyway, today I took my Adderall and was just getting my work done. I had to go downstairs for something, and on my way down, I grabbed my coffee mug and my snack plate. I put the plate in the dishwasher and washed the mug. Then, I went back to my desk and noticed I hadn't switched my daily dog rating calendar and fixed that. While I was doing that I was like, ""Hm, I kinda have to pee."" So, I went pee. Then, when I was washing my hands, I noticed I'd left some scrunchies sitting outside their jar and put them away. Then, saw that a couple were my ""desk scrunchies"" so I took them back to my desk. 

I sat down to start working again and realized I just did a bunch of small tasks that, normally, I would think, ""meh, I'll do it later."" 

Normally, I'd be like, ""I should do that thing."" And then just keep going not doing the thing. It really is amazing how much of a difference these meds make. And, you'd think after like 15 or 16 years of taking them, I'd be used to that by now, but nope. Here I am, still flabbergasted at how functional I am on them. I'm so envious of normal people.

1irvlo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/comments/1irvlo1/my_thoughts_on_how_a_tv_show_should_go/,my thoughts on how a TV show should go.,"I started making a comment about a tv show but the app on mobile wasn't happy with how long the post got so here i am writing a proper post on a keyboard (eww) for everyone's thoughts. 

I think a New TV show (NTVS) should be animated but I can also see it being live action without too\* much difficulty. 

In my head it is made up of seasons covering mostly 2 books, of between 10 and 12 episodes each. The micro-fiction and short stories will get put in at various places, or not included yet.  For the sake of the show and seasons being different from books, I envisioned that some plot points may be changed and some timelines moved about. \*\* This is in aid of drama on a screen being different from a book. Any words in **Bold** should be taken as episode names

I am also imagining it will have a narrator in Harry's voice, that will start and end most episodes and seasons. \*\*\*

\*slight wince at the price. 

\*\*it will make sense i promise.

\*\*\*played my James Masters I hope. 

ok. season 1! here we go. 

themes:

 Susan, in over her head and harry not helping. 

Karrin, not trusting Dresden, 

Bianca growing to hate harry and act against him

Marcone discovering magic. 

S1E1, **Storm front**. A 1 hour special pilot to introduce the characters, arcs etc. set up the first seasons arcs. Susan, Vampires, Marcone. Karrin not trusting Harry. 

the rest of S1 is a mix of fool moon and grave peril. It will continue the themes of Harry's love life, The vampires and Marcone having it out/Marcone killing off other rival gangs. This can lead to..

S1E2. start of fool moon, ends with harry getting the invite for the ball. 

S1E2-E6 follows leads and works the case, ending in...

S1E7 **Fool Moon** final showdown with the loup garru. this will be the turning point for the karrin arc. 

S1E8 **Masquerade** Harry and Michael go to the ball. 

S1E9 **Grave peril** Harry must choose. It ends with Harry in the dark with the vampires.. the implications are implied. et the end susan is also turned. 

S1E10. **PyroFuego** Harry burns it down and escapes. susan leaves. The season ends with Harry in the dark having a nightmare showing the first mental scar he takes. 

  
This concludes season one and wraps up the main threads of;

 Susan nicely and sets up susan2\* arc of not being there. 

Bianca vs harry. This leads into Reds vs WC (where we see it could be harry starting it which is important.)

It furthers but does not finish

Karrin. this is the first time she trusts him and is a big step. but come on people there are several seasons of Karrin to go. 

Marcone and magic. I think this needs a bit of a push honestly and maybe him seeing vampire biker gangs may need to happen. 

\*Vampire Boogaloo 

  
Season 2.

The main theme here is lonely-ness and the world opening up as well. In addition to Harry's depression.  This season covers Summer night and death masks. A departure from the books is I would move the duel to late on in the season and have Susan and martin's appearance be a surprise.  I would have them acting in the city for a few episodes with hints and teasers, like maybe her walking behind him watching with martin, or them sat in a coffee shop watching him walk past and the camera stops on them. 

Anther change is to move death masks to be mid season but have summer knight be the big finale. Its more visual impressive and story important than the denarians RN. 

themes: 

Depression and getting life back on track

new friends and new allies.

finding work

S2E1  **The day it rained frogs** this sets up billy helping Dresden find work and can also set up Larry fowler too as a reason Harry even goes on. Harry can then meet with the fae or with the priest from death masks too to set up that 

also the invite to the meeting with the council.  and mab popping in.

S2E2 **The Larry Fowler Show** sets up the duel and the ongoing joke of LF out to sue Harry.  Has the council meting and mabs demands. 

S2E3-E5 case work.  one should be called **death masks.**  and feature marcone needing it but not why.  introduces the archive, kincaid, etc.  One should be called  **Elain** to make a joke in S4 happen

S2E6 **The duel/Rigley field**  i

S2E7, **Flight Risk** the fight at the airport

S2E8 **The noose.**  The train fight,. ends at Michaels and he gest the coin

S2E9 **Tyr Na Nog./ The battle in the clouds** the fight for the stone table begins. 

S2E10 **To kill a Lady.**  harry kills Aurora and it ends. He goes to hospital and finds Marcone and lets him take it to help the child on the promise its returned in 3 days.  The season ends with that scene of harry trusting marcone and marcones humanity.  the final scene is Harry building his containment circle and burying lash

This season may need to be longer and bringing back Susan so soon (1 season) is different when its 2 books later.  I do think that mab should speak to Harry in episode 1 and then the council invited him in episode 2. I can see a 13 episode season working even better here. 

Season 3. 

The big themes here are Harry not having allies and the war. It will introduce Thomas as his brother (he will appear in S1 and S2 before this) and the wardens. and Hint that Ebenezer is gramps.  It will cover Blood rites and dead beat. this is a 13 episode season.  Sheila is introduced and lasts all season. 

S3E1. **A peculiar set of favours** sets up harry working at the P\* set and him trying to find the word. 

S3E2-E5 sets up the black magic and ties it to The director guy and there is the whole thing of ""is ti narcomancy, is it the coven of P\*s or is it bad luck.""  Kincaid shows up and flirts with Karrin

S3E6 **Marvra** this is the raid on the lair. eb shows up. they go in guns blazing. 

S3E7 **Burns.**  His hand is burned. Marvra escapes. there is a rest. the war goes bad. Eb rushes off. Its implied that Ed should have been helping the WC not Dresden.  Karrin goes on holdiay strait after with kincaid.  Its shown as more of a hookup than it is in the books.  Sheila is there more. 

S3E8 **The deeps**  (maybe mix this with the episode after to shorten the season.) Harry discovers Thomas is his brother, 

S3E9 **He Who Walks Behind**  the showdown in the deeps and  lara saves the day.  last scene marvra blackmails him for the book he is hunting.  Maybe harry calls for help here

S3E10. **The Erlking.**  Maybe harry calls for help here. harry (with Sheila) discover the rite to call the earlking.  haryr confronts shelia, bob is stolen

S3E11. **The Wardens** they show up. recruit harry. go in guns blazing.  Harry makes a detour to the museum. 

S3E12 **Death curse.** / **Sue**. harry pushes into rescue the wardens. killls the corpsetaker. Morgan attacks, 

S3E13 **The Darkhallow.**  Harry fights cowl. bob saves the day. the Episode ends with Harry and bob talking about the death curse and Shelia and harry looks at his palm... its Lash's symbol.  Harry goes to bed.. and hears in the dark, during a nigghtmare...""DIE ALONE""

  
This sets up the war going  badly and harry may have feelings for karrin. He comes out of it with allies he doesn't trust but maybe should, and an ally he trusts but maybe shouldn't.  

**Season 4** is a biggun. another 13 episodes.  the thing im not including is the hellfire/lash arc but it needs to be in here. 

The themes are allies and the war again, this time helping them and being helped in return. A big cut out here is that Molly will spend about 1 year less as an apprentice as this is the biggest time jump between books. 

S4E1  **An annoying phone call**. Molly calls for help. The murders begin. Molly sees some of them.  The episode starts with harry meditating and the phone ringing and disrupting him. 

S4E2. **The trail of (unnamed Korean warlock) .** more white night plots. maybe Thomas is the bad guy. harry has to witness the execution of the warlock. has the 

S4E43 **Splattercon!!!** The expo starts. 

S4E4 **The scarecrow.**  a lot of the plot of  Proven guilty happens here. 

S4E5 **An annoying phone call**.**... again.**  harry casts the spell and it goes off badly.. episode starts with harry meditating and the phone ringing like episdoe 1. 

S4E6. **Elaine again.**  they meet the ordo. She helps him realise what happened to Molly.  they fight the skavis 

S4E7. **the cinema/Fairland**  harry, Lilly, fix and the crew storm fairyland Elaine is explained as not being there as protecting the ordo while he fights the fetches. 

S4E8 **The wellspring of winter.** Climax of the book. harry calls the council

S4E9 **the water beetle** while waiting for the WC to show up harry fights the ghouls and we see camp kaboom. 

S4E10**the Trail of Molly Carpenter.**  Lilly And Sir Michael save the day and the council tells harry about the meeting of the Whites. Carlos agrees to stay and help harry here

S4E11. **The deeps again/the white court of vampires.**

S4E12 **the duel in the deeps.** 

S4E13 **double cross.**  the ghouls attack. marcone saves the day. lara and harry escape. 

this season is very auction packed honestly and pushes what can be in it.   
Harry ends with a new apprentice, allies in the  ordo, distrust between him and carlos, and an alliance with Marcone. the season ends with harry morning lash and dropping the coin. 

NOTE. i WOULD LIKE LASH TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER SEASON BUT NO CAN DO IM AFRAID. SHE IS AROUND FOR 2 BOOKS AND 12 HOURS. 

Season 5. Small favour and short stories.  this is the first 1-book-1-season season and contains Day Off. Backup,  

the theme is loss and pain. Harry is a dick to Molly a lot, he gets a lot of migraines, and suffers. 

S5E1 **small favour** mab asks harry to help Marcone.  he says no and helps muprh with her case. plus he has time off comeing up...

S5E2. **Day Off**

S5E3-5 mab pressures harry, events unfold, **backup** 

S5E6 **the train station**

S5E7 **The Knight of the sword.**

S5E8. **the Aquarium.**  he talks with nic. 

S5 E9 **Soulfire** ivy is kidnapped

S5E10. **Find the Kid.**

S5E11 **The island.** they go to the island and explore

S5E12. **the circle** they rescue ivy and Michael ius hurt.

S5E13. **with frosting of white** the flight from the island. he keeps on hearing DIE ALONE. the fight with nic on the boat. the water scene. rescue. Molly saves him Harry goes to the hospital.  then scene in the capel plays out. at the end of his rant he sits alone in the pew and hears....DIE ALONE

this season contains some dark moments. harry is at his lowest at the start of it and this season is him trying to get better. he falls down, and gets back up again. 

Season 6. 

This season is dominated by an injured Morgan andbut harry is happy enough. he has anastasia, things are getting less bleak if only his migraines would go away. 

S6E1. **A knock best left unanswered** Morgan arrives. 

S6E2 **The skinwalker.**  harry is driving and goes to billy's. the fight there.  Molly arrives while Harry is out. he returns to an interesting tablau. Molly asks if they should call her dad. 

S6E3. t**he warrior.** episode starts with molly asking if they should call her dad. harry doesn't answer... fades to black and is a the short story warrior, 

S6E4 **Club zero.  maybe the council here**

S6E5 **binder. maybe the council here**

S6E6 **Château Raith** 

S6E7 this spisode should be a morgan flash back episode.. maybe himn and harry. maybe made for the show. 

S6E8. **the deadline** harry calls the wardens and goes to the island.

S6E9 **Sanctum Invocation.** Harry calls out and fights demonreach

S6E10 **Intelectus.**  the showdown with the gatekeeper.  the ominous words... IT wells up here. 

S6E11.   **Wile E. Coyote**. **everyone arrives.** 

S6E12. **Nagloshi.** harry, toot and eventually LTW fight the nagloshi

I'm between the Timemore Scultpor 064 with the turbo burrs and the Fellow Ode gen 2 maybe with the SSP upgrade. If given the choice for a grinder strictly for pour over and Moccamaster, which one would you choose? 

Pertinent info: This will never be used for espresso. We primarily drink light roasts with an occasional medium. The Moccamaster is the weekday work horse and pour overs for the weekend. Looking for electric because grinding 60g of coffee by hand does not sound appealing. Keeping it under $600 for that happy wife, happy life.

1irvjnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SororityAlumInitiate/comments/1irvjnu/ran_home_ai_success_and_advice/,Ran Home - AI Success and advice,"My first piece of advice is to be patient and continue to be patient. Things work out in the end. My journey took a little longer because of when I started researching and the fact that my organization tends to do in person initiation either with a collegiate chapter or at convention, with virtual initiation not being the norm. From when I first spoke to anyone from my organization to when I will be initiated in April, my journey will be approximately 8 months.

My second piece of advice is to not be afraid to put yourself out there even if it makes you feel uncomfortable. Organizations and friendships are about connections, so don’t be afraid to be the one to initiate those connections even if you feel awkward. You never know who you will meet and the impact they will have on your life and journey if you don’t open yourself up to different opportunities and keep and open mind.

While I looked at alumnae initiation off and on for years, I didn’t seriously start looking into it until this past July/August when a couple friends in different organizations suggested I pursue it. I started researching all the NPC organizations. I looked at who had chapters (alumnae and collegiate) near me, looked at IG accounts for chapters to get a feel for the groups, and talked to people on Reddit as well as those I know in real life who belonged to different organizations.  During my search, I spoke to a member on this subreddit that changed everything.  She was an AI with an organization I had looked at in my research, but for whatever reason I hadn’t initially considered. It turned out that she lived near me, so we met for lunch and ended up talking for a couple hours. She put me in touch with the President of the Alumnae Chapter closest to me who reached out to me immediately. I met her for tea and again had a great conversation that lasted a couple hours.  She invited me to attend their upcoming chapter event. She wasn’t able to attend the event, but put me in contact with the member who was organizing it so she knew to expect me. I attended every monthly chapter event since that first one in October and made new connections at each event I went to.  I made it a point to build relationships with the members I met and made plans with them outside of organized chapter events including meeting for coffee and girls day outings. Essentially, I put myself out there and attended everything even if I felt awkward. I also made sure to reach out to people after events even if it was just to say it was nice to meet them.  

With that, I am so excited to share that I was accepted for membership in Alpha Gamma Delta. Thank you so much for starting this subreddit as it played a pivotal role in me finding my home. If anyone wants to know more about my journey, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. ",5,1739828019.0,SororityAlumInitiate,3,1.0,False

Feel like I’m going round in circles,"Im 24F and I have about 4 fillings. These were because I didn’t go to the dentist for about 4 years (3 years uni + 1 year living abroad). Since the fillings Ive made a concerted effort to go to the dentist twice a year and every time I go, it’s always negative. I’ve made an effort to floss more often and scrape my tongue. I have an electric toothbrush, don’t drink coffee, and have drastically reduced my fizzy drinks and sugary sweets intake. Despite all this, I’m told that I *might* have periodontal disease and that I’ll need more fillings and possible root canals.

When I express my concerns about inflammation, sensitivity (i’ve used sensitive toothpaste since I was an adult), gum disease, all they say is ‘keep brushing and flossing’ but *I am* and nothing seems to improve. I noted that my mom had gum disease (she doesn’t drink or smoke, brushed 3 times a day, flossed etc), she ended up with mouth cancer and had part of her gum/teeth removed but they don’t seem concerned. 

I’m very anxious about my teeth (purely because they won’t tell me if gum disease/mouth cancer is hereditary) and feel like they’re happy to drill holes and charge for whatever without getting to the problem. 

Should I change dentists or does anybody have any tips for better care at home? (It’s the dentist I’ve been to since I was born, the same place where my mom had a tooth removed which created a lump which was found to be cancerous).

Right now, I have a minimum spend policy: $50 per hour, which includes having a barista on-site. If the group’s purchases don’t hit that threshold, the host pays the difference. So, for example:

A group rents for 2 hours but buys nothing → The host pays $100.

A group rents for 2 hours and buys $85 in drinks → The host pays $15.

A group rents for 2 hours and spends $115 → The host owes nothing.

Hey guys,

I realised a few months ago that I’ve wasted my 20s and not did the things that would have made my life easier

I wasted my early to mid 20s and didn’t push myself for opportunities and getting ahead. People my age manage to do their day job, side hustle, go to the gym, socialise and look gorgeous while they do it - please help me figure it out!

I didn’t always take care of myself physically - spent so much time working in bed. Drank, occasionally smoked and ate whatever.

I also barely stretched - how fucked is my body right now, can I fix it? 😭

My room is always messy and this makes me sad. When I’m rushing around or running errands I don’t take the time to put on jewellery or do my skincare - such a little thing but I feel like I don’t look as put together or pretty as my peers and I’ve ‘wasted my beauty’ if that makes sense

They say your 20s are the foundation to the rest of your life - I feel like I’ve wasted them (Fyi must mention I am pretty mentally ill and have physical things too but trying to push through)

People of reddit give me your best routine tips for things to do - I don’t want vague advice I want actual daily/weekly/monthly tips I can put in practice:

E.g 1. Drink lemon water first thing in the morning and coffee an hour later
Or, Stretch for 15 minutes every morning

Literally anything! Food tips, exercise, life advice etc just please put it in a routine style plan (from an adhd riddled girly)

He's 78. My mother passed away in 2023. She did a lot for my dad. Cooked. Clean. Shopped. Etc. 

When she died he struggled for the few months but I would say within 6 months he was eating and doing laundry and had cleaners coming in. He was on the road to recovery. But then some cancer came back in his foot. He ended up having the area below his knee amputated in September. He got his prosthetic the first week of December and started walking again pretty quick. He can be on it all day at this point.


Problem: my brother and his family moved into his home in september, to take care of him until he got back on his feet. He's not back on his feet and they are still there. They plan to stay there indefinitely now, selling their home and moving their belongings in. 


My father now intends to give them the home after he passes. He says he enjoys their company. They wait on him hand and foot. Often bringing him alcohol and food. They actually hindered his recovery. He could have gotten moving alot quicker if they didn't wait on him hand and foot and made him do things like get his own coffee.  He can drive now and go uo steps and walk with his prosthetic. Doing everything like before his only complaint is that after about 8 or 9 hours he gets some soreness. 


My mother always said that she did not want me and my brothers to take care of her and my father when they got old. She was the primary caregiver of her MIL (my grandmother) who lived with us growing up. She had dementia and alzheimers. She did some bizarre shit like rake the yard in her underwear for the school bus to see when I was getting dropped off as an elementary school kid. I remember one time, me and my brothers had to tie her down with my rainbow jump rope because she was trying to leave and get in the car while my mother was at the store. This was before cellphones. We were both less then 10. It's a fucked up story I know. 


My mother realized we went through some shit growing up and knew that she didn't want that obligation to go onto us. 

My mother did say a week before she passed that she just wanted to make sure my father had the support he need. She said he will need to have his hand held for a while. But I guess she told my other brother to take care of him?a different ways of saying what she said to me. 

Now my brother feels obligated to it. My father also claims he enjoys my brothers company. I just think it's odd. I know him and my brother spend a lot of time drinking too which irks me. 


Is it normal for a 78 year old man who basically just had given up on living an independent life?  I am just struggling with this whole situation and am very annoyed with how things have gone down. ",2,1739827264.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

You're sitting there, divorce papers scattered across your kitchen table, scrolling dating apps at 2AM. I get it. Your bed's too empty, your ego's bruised, and that cute barista just slipped you their number.

Stop.

Put the phone down.

This isn't some preachy BS about ""finding yourself"" or ""healing time."" This is about protecting your ass - legally and financially. Because that innocent coffee date? It could cost you custody, cash, and credibility faster than your ex can say ""lawyer up.""

Think you're slick keeping it private? Please. In 2025, there's no such thing. One tagged photo, one location check-in, one nosy neighbor with a camera phone - that's all it takes to hand your ex's attorney a gold-plated gift.

**Legal Booby Traps: How a Romantic Relationship Can Empty Your Wallet and Tank Your Custody Case**

Divorce court isn’t a therapy session. It’s war. And dating someone new while you’re still legally married can hand your soon-to-be ex-spouse's attorney the ammo they need to blow your case apart:

* **Alimony Ambush:** In some states, dating—even casually—can be spun as “marital misconduct” or adultery. Translation: you look like the bad guy, and your ex might walk away with more of your marital assets and a bigger spousal support check each month.
* **Custody Crosshairs:** Bringing a new partner into your kids’ lives too soon? Opposing counsel can paint you as unstable, impulsive, or worse. Courts prioritize “child welfare” over your need for late-night cocktails. Favorable child custody arrangements are at risk when your personal life is questioned.
* **Digital Dirt:** Think your dating app chats are private? Think again. Texts, DMs, and even your Tinder profile can be subpoenaed and weaponized against you in divorce proceedings. Legal fees climb fast when this happens.

**Playbook Move:** Before your first date, ask your divorce attorney: “What would a judge think about this?” Don’t gamble—strategize. A clear understanding of specific laws in your state is critical.

**The Rebound Trap: Why Dating Now Might Wreck You Later**

Here’s a hard pill: the person you date while still licking your wounds is usually a placeholder, not a soulmate. The urge to “fill the void” can lead you straight into these emotional landmines:

* **Pain Disguised as Passion:** A new love can feel like an escape, but it often just masks the stress and confusion you haven’t processed. Numbing with a romantic relationship delays the personal growth and own healing you actually need.
* **Fantasy Filter:** When you’re lonely, anyone who seems remotely decent can look like a savior. Spoiler alert: they’re probably not. And ignoring red flags now means more heartbreak later.
* **Guilt Spiral:** Even if you wanted the divorce, moving on too fast can trigger waves of guilt. Emotional whiplash can mess with your clarity and self-worth, with lasting impacts on your next relationship.

**Playbook Move:** Write this down for 30 days: “What am I hoping this person will fix for me?” Patterns don’t lie. Your journal will expose what you’re really seeking beyond this actual event.

**The Co-Parenting Tightrope: Don’t Let a Date Undo Your Kids’ Stability**

Kids are resilient, but they’re not bulletproof. Bringing someone new into their world while they’re still adjusting can destabilize the whole family dynamic. Here’s the fallout you’re risking:

* **Broken Trust:** Kids may see your new partner as a replacement, not an addition. The result? Resentment and withdrawal.
* **Team Parent or Team Stranger:** Too-early introductions can force kids to pick sides emotionally. They shouldn’t feel like they’re betraying their other parent just by liking your new person.
* **Weaponized in Court:** If your ex can frame your dating life as disruptive, your custody arrangements could shift overnight. Legal issues surrounding custody rights are often magnified by a contentious divorce.

https://preview.redd.it/7fmplsc7nrje1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c0c70007861b3aa302e80a5d26aa2fc27747e95

**Playbook Move:** Wait at least 6 months before introducing a new person. Focus on rebuilding routines and showing your kids you’re their constant. Family stability is your power move.

**What to Do Instead: Rebuild Without the Relationship Crutch**

Feeling lonely doesn’t mean you need a partner. It means you need a new life. Build your post-divorce foundation with these power moves:

* **Social Recharge:** Join groups that fuel your passions—hiking clubs, art classes, volunteering. Rediscover what lights you up, and meet new people without the pressure of romance.
* **Therapy > Tinder:** A therapist will help you unpack the emotional wreckage. A life coach will push you toward future goals. That duo beats a mediocre date any day.
* **Solo Adventures:** Take a weekend trip alone. New city, new mindset. Facing life solo proves you can thrive—partner or not.

**If You Absolutely Must Date (Because, Life): Do It Smart**

If the pull is too strong and you decide to dive into new relationships anyway, treat dating like a stealth operation:

* **Honesty First:** Be upfront with dates about your legal status and divorce process. No one wants to find out over drinks that you’re technically still married.
* **Stay Low Profile:** Skip the apps. They’re a digital paper trail waiting to haunt you. Meet new people organically—through friends, hobbies, or events.
* **Protect Your Privacy:** Get a burner number for dating. Assume every message, selfie, and meme is exhibit A in a courtroom someday.

**Here's What It Comes Down To: Power Is in the Pause**

Dating before divorce isn’t sinful. It’s just high-stakes. Every move you make can ripple into your financial consequences, property division, and custody arrangements. Ask yourself: Is this quick thrill worth jeopardizing my financial interests and right time for a new chapter?

Sometimes the smartest power play is waiting. Because the best version of you deserves more than a rebound.

We’re from Brightmnds, and we’re here because we recently noticed that we got several orders from people who came to our website from Reddit. That caught us by surprise—in a good way! We had no idea our kit was being discussed here, so we were really curious to check it out.

Since we’re here, we figured we’d also put together a long post about everything you need to know about string art kits, plus an honest story of how we built our brand—why we designed our kit the way we did, how we developed our generator, and who it’s really for.

We’re not here to sell anything or push you to buy—just excited to connect with people who are genuinely interested in learning about our product and how we built it.

🔹 About the generator

When we started Brightmnds, our top priority was to develop a generator that accurately converts a photo into string art while providing clear instructions. We tested several existing solutions, but none met our standards:

Some created very simplistic designs with sparse lines, making the final artwork look nothing like the original photo.

Others offered detailed picture but came with over 7000 steps, turning the process into an exhausting marathon.

Some provided amazing previews, but the actual string art result was nowhere near what was promised.

We built our generator from scratch, refining the algorithms for months to ensure that the final artwork perfectly matches the preview. Our instructions are 3,000–4,000 steps long, striking the right balance between detail and ease of execution.

We wanted to create a kit that makes the entire process enjoyable, not just the final result. One major flaw we found in existing DIY kits (even some on Amazon) is that you have to hammer in all the nails yourself. 

We felt that asking customers to do this themselves would be the worst thing we could design—it would take away so much of the enjoyment of making string art. Instead of diving straight into the creative process, you'd first have to spend hours monotonously hammering nails. That’s why we embarked on a long journey to find the perfect manufacturing solution.

Creating the pre-nailed board turned out to be the most challenging part. We went through multiple prototypes—some with terrible-quality bases, others that looked good at first but completely warped and bent under the tension of the thread after 4,000 pulls. After several failed prototypes, we finally found the perfect solution: A pre-nailed high-quality board with all 240 nails perfectly placed at the correct height and spacing.

🔹 Who is this kit for?

String art isn’t for everyone. Before buying, you should know that this is a time-consuming and detail-oriented process. On average, completing a piece takes 6 to 10 hours. You can, of course, spread this out over several days or weeks, but this isn’t an instant-result craft—it’s a calm, meditative experience.

Our step-by-step generator guides you through every move, offering helpful tips along the way. You can follow along with voice or visual instructions, and you can even turn on relaxing music or nature sounds (or mute them and listen your favorite show in the background).

It’s not for everyone, but we know that many people (ourselves included!) find the process incredibly rewarding.

🔹 We’d love to hear from you!

If anyone here already has our kit, we’d love to hear your feedback! Whether positive or constructive, your thoughts help us improve. We are constantly refining our kit, service, and overall customer experience, and we truly appreciate every opinion.

1irv5bq,https://i.redd.it/zecbse12nrje1.jpeg,My Report on Attending Fulham-Nottingham Forest Game in Hospitality Section,"As I noted in this post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fulhamfc/s/YBtVUICyP8

I attended my first Fulham match after following them for more than 20 years in the U.S. Because I wanted to be sure I would get tickets (risk averse, travel companion is difficult), I bought the cheapest hospitality package I could. The price was an astonishing £169 with fees per ticket. I was seated in the Riverside, section 23, row 40. I would have liked to have been closer. While the rows below me were nearly all full, mine was mostly empty as were those above me. The view was excellent and comparable to my DC United seats, which I surrendered last year after 23 years.  I was able to enter the stadium without going down through housing complex about a block beyond the stadium because the gate monitor liked my purple hair - his coworker was not in agreement, but he was overruled. 

On the website, they said the package included 3 drink coupons. When I got there I was also given a coupon for a meal (chicken burger and fries) and a snack (soft pretzel). Water, coffee and tea were offered gratis. I used one drink coupon as I’d already had a pint at the Lion pre-game and I gave the other two to the very nice folks I shared a table with pre-game. For my next trip to the Cottage I will try to get tickets that are not hospitality and only go that route if I fail through other channels. However, I don’t regret going hospitality for this game because I don’t think I could have gotten tickets otherwise. ",25,1739827059.0,fulhamfc,3,1.0,False

1irv2v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/comments/1irv2v6/rant_eugenes_loneliness_problem_is_not_due_to_a/,"Rant: Eugene's loneliness problem is not due to a lack of events, it's caused by a lack of social skills and work ethic in building relationships.","I'm sure this will irritate some people but if a person's sincere lived experience offends you, perhaps it's time for some introspection. I'm a guy in my mid 30s who moved to Eugene a couple years ago from Columbus, OH. I moved to the west coast because I love the landscape and weather here and wanted to experience both and meet like-minded people to share it with (and my career allowed me to make such a move). Unfortunately that has not worked out for me, and it's not for a lack of trying. Meetup groups, sports groups, hiking groups, volunteering, hanging at bars/coffee shops, striking up conversations with people at the library, comedy shows, I've done them all.

There will probably be knee-jerk comments accusing me of being some anti-social weirdo without evidence as the cause, but I'm confident that I am not the issue here. I'm a pretty sociable person who enjoys meeting and learning about other people and had a great friend group back in Ohio that all met through meetup. As it happens life changes and my group scattered to the winds over time so I decided it was time to get out of Ohio and come here. Though I did sometimes encounter it in Columbus, I've been shocked by how cold, flaky, and generally uninteresting people here are (or at least that's how they present themselves to others). I go to one event after another and experience the same phenomena: People either unable or unwilling to reciprocate in conversation, show no desire to learn about anyone else, or spend the entire time talking about themselves without showing interest in the other person. Or they complain about the weather, which as someone who grew up in the Midwest just makes me laugh.

  
I have a friend who I met in Ohio who also moved out here to be close to family and he's had the exact same issue. He's been here even longer than I have, is more extroverted than me, and has found no one. He's given up, which I can't blame him for but it just makes me sad. He's a great guy and would be a positive addition to many people's lives but you can't force people to socialize if they don't want to. I'm just glad here's here or I'd have no one to hang out with.

  
I enjoy meeting people and learning about them and what they're passionate about, but when you have one instance after another of conversations that feel like pulling teeth it sucks all the fun out of going to these events. Everyone I meet here is super polite which is great, but once you get past that it's a wasteland of poor social skills and frankly people just coming off as being boring as hell. I recently went to a group where the first person I struck up a conversation with spent 5 minutes complaining about their job and never bothered to ask me anything about myself. They had a video game shirt on so I asked them what sort of games they played and mentioned that I built my own computer to play games on. Their response was another 5 minutes talking about how their computer was old and needed upgrades but they didn't know how to do it and would I be interested in hanging out this weekend to help them build it? I'll pass.

  
Another time I went to a hiking group a number of times with my friend. Know how many engaging conversations we had? Zero. Want to know how many people actually started conversations with us without prompting? None. We started every conversation we had in that group, and got the cold shoulder every time. No reciprocation. It became clear that all people wanted to do was go to this group with their friends and ignore everyone else so we stopped wasting our time trying.

  
Another instance occurred when my friend invited me to an after hours work event with some coworkers and their friends. A coworker introduced us to two brothers in their late 20s, and we both thought it could be an opportunity to make a connection with someone around our age. Nope, these two were just bumps on a log. I'm not sure either had any interests at all and neither guy asked us anything about ourselves. Do they go hiking? No. Movies? No. Board/video games? Nope. Card games? No. How about concerts? No. Sports? No. It was ridiculous, talk about boring. By the time we moved on from those black holes we were both wondering what they actually did with their time because they didn't seem to like anything at all.

  
One last example for those who those with stubbornness issues, my apartment complex recently had a fun painting event at the clubhouse for residents. It was entirely free and they provided plenty of snacks. Want to know how many people showed up out of my entire complex that has 8 or 9 apartment blocks? 8, and half of those were over 50. Impressive turnout for a free event that's not more than a 2 minute walk from anywhere in the complex.

The point is, if you don't go out and *talk to people*, you're never going to meet anyone. Simply going to an event isn't enough, you have to actually put effort into engaging with and learning about other people for them to want to do the same with you. I don't know what the deal is with people here but there's an epidemic of terrible socializing and an unwillingness to put the work in to have even basic conversations, let along getting together later on. I've beat my head on the wall enough to get tired of the squishy sound so I'll be moving to another state this year that hopefully will not be like Eugene. I really love Oregon and will be sad to leave, I'm going to miss the incredible landscapes and mild weather. Eugene itself is not a bad place to live, and I've enjoyed many things about it. But I'm not going to miss it and I'm not sure I'll remember much about it in the future as the people have been utterly forgettable, which I find sad.

  
I don't know what people here spend their time doing but from the lack social skills or any real hobbies at all I keep running into I suspect people are just sitting on social media all day. If that's correct, and if there's anyone who feels like I may be describing them in the previous paragraphs reading this, I'd say get off the apps and do something else, because social media doesn't make you an interesting person, really it does the opposite with too much use. If all you do is flip through TikTok and watch Netflix all day, you aren't going to have much to offer someone. I have a lot to offer, I love geology, hiking, history, physics, football, board/video games, new ethic foods, traveling, poker, dumb youtube videos, action movies, old maps, and can talk engagingly about all of them among other things. If you can't do that with anything you're interested in, and you find yourself feeling lonely and wishing you had friends to hang out with, the problem is looking you in the mirror.",27,1739826900.0,Eugene,23,0.67,False

I have recently been in a relationship (7 months) that ended 1-2 weeks ago. As I am processing the experience, I have realized that I was in a narcissistic relationship (35F/40M). Looking back, the love bombing was there, the idealization of our future together, then he kept being overly suspicious of me thinking I was lying, jealous of guy friends etc. I do photography and I know that he was okay with me doing photography of other people but not any pictures of myself. I have a hormonal imbalance and he wasn't very understanding and supportive of that. It seemed through many examples that he only cared about his needs and not being compassionate and understanding to things I was going through. He often brought up the fact I wasn't doing enough or putting enough effort in. I started cooking more, cleaning more (which I totally don't mind) but he would expect me to know what he wanted without communicating to me healthily about it. He expected me to jump up and do these things without him having to ask. I stepped up and it made him happy except getting up before him and making coffee and taking care of the dog. I slacked on that and eventually it made him very frustrated. Long story short, I ended up feeling very unseen, unheard, and any attempt to communicate my needs got blame-shifted of course. He wanted me to move in and I cant right now because I have a major career change coming up and moving and a career change is just far too much stress for me. He wasn't very understanding, even though I would only need a few months to get situated, AND the fact that I did not want to move into his apartment only to move again when his lease was up in November of this year. I said it makes more sense to find a house together when his lease was up and that would give me time to make more money to support the future we wanted. He did not take that well. I also told him that I did not feel emotionally safe and that's why I have hesitated putting my full on effort into it because part of me felt like if I did I would completely lose myself. I had trouble opening up to him because I didn't know if I would get Jekyll or Hyde.

I have a history of being very codependent and have had abusive relationships in the past. I had a malignant from age 20-26. I know the ropes. But this time it was much subtler and didn't see it right away but my spidey senses did kick in. That's why when I put up boundaries and explained that I needed to feel seen, heard, appreciated, and explained my worth is much more than what I can do for someone, he split. I worked very hard over the years to cultivate my own sense of self and that's why I resisted the urge to throw myself at a potentially spiritually chastising position.

However, I have a secret. I have a kink where I actually really like a master/slave energetic dance. Of course I do not actually enjoy being degraded, and do not want my whole life to be dominated and controlled, nor am I into physical pain or harm, but part of me finds this fantasy quite hot and satisfying. It would have to be practiced only in certain situations with clear boundaries on when it was appropriate and when it was not. I wouldn't mind being called ""you're mine"" and being possessed over. 

  
I am wondering if I had communicated this to my partner if it would have made the relationship better. (I feel ridiculous even entertaining that thought, but here I am pondering it). I wonder if we could have made a consensual deal, without my life being completely dissolved, while still maintaining the fantasy of this. My gut says that a narc wouldn't be able to respect the boundaries even if it was agreed upon, potentially putting myself in a more worse emotional and spiritual position.

I'm also wondering if this fantasy, this deviant need would/could also be satisfied with a healthy partner that would understand it was only role-playing and to allow my friendships, hobbies, and career to also flourish in reality.

Later, at the Daily Planet

Clark strolls into the bullpen, still feeling the weight of his latest training session. He’s distracted, running a hand through his hair when a familiar voice cuts through his thoughts.

Lois: [cheerfully] Well, look who finally decided to show up. I was starting to think you got lost in the supply closet.

Clark: [forcing a smile] Hey, Lois.

Lois: [narrowing her eyes] What’s with you? You look... weird.

Clark: [quickly] I do not look weird.

Lois: [tilting her head] No, you totally do. You’ve got that “I did something embarrassing and hope no one finds out” look.

Clark: [chuckling nervously] I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Lois: [grinning] Oh, come on, Smallville. Spill. Did you walk into a door again? Trip over your own feet? Accidentally call the Editor ‘Dad’?

Clark: [deadpan] That was *one* time.

Lois: [giggling] And I will never let you live it down.

Clark shakes his head, trying to push past his awkwardness, but Lois isn’t letting up. She leans on his desk, eyeing him curiously.

Lois: [smirking] You know, you’ve been acting kind of... off lately. Sneaking around, disappearing at weird times. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were hiding something.

Clark: [quickly] I’m not hiding anything!

Lois: [raising an eyebrow] Uh-huh. That was convincing.

Clark: [clearing his throat] I’ve just been... training.

Lois: [mock surprise] Training? Since when do you work out? You already look like you bench press cars for fun.

Clark: [muttering] You have no idea.

Lois: [crossing her arms] Okay, so what kind of training?

Clark hesitates for a split second too long.

Lois: [grinning] Oh my God, is it dating training?

Clark: [choking on air] What?! No!

Lois: [laughing] You totally hesitated!

Clark: [flustered] I did not—

Lois: [teasing] Are you taking, like, romance lessons? Did you buy one of those “How to Date Like a Pro” self-help books?

Clark: [groaning] Lois—

Lois: [gasping dramatically] Wait—are you practicing for someone?

Clark: [struggling] I—It’s just... personal improvement!

Lois: [winking] Sure, sure. Whatever helps you sleep at night, Smallville.

Clark sighs, slumping into his chair as Lois saunters off, pleased with herself.

Lois: [calling over her shoulder] Just let me know if you need a practice date. I promise to go easy on you!

Clark drops his head onto his desk, groaning.

Clark: [muttering] This is worse than Jor-El’s training.

He’s still mortified, but as he watches Lois walk away, he can’t help but smile. Maybe, just maybe, he’s getting closer to being ready.

***

Later That Night – Clark’s Loft, The Barn

Clark sits on the couch, still replaying his conversation with Lois. He lets out a long sigh, rubbing his face. As much as Jor-El’s training was awkward, this—navigating his feelings for Lois while keeping his secret—was even harder.

Suddenly, a familiar rush of wind signals an incoming visitor. Before he even looks up, he knows who it is.

Oliver Queen: [grinning] I knew I’d find you here, brooding in the barn.

Clark: [without looking up] I don’t brood.

Oliver: [raising an eyebrow] Please. You practically invented brooding. Batman's gonna owe you royalties someday.

Clark finally glances up, unamused.

Oliver: [sitting down, arms crossed] Alright, spill it. You’ve got that face.

Clark: [sighing] What face?

Oliver: [smirking] The ""Lois did something that threw you off, and now you don’t know how to function like a normal person"" face.

Clark opens his mouth to argue but then closes it. Fair point.

Clark: [reluctantly] She might have figured out I’m hiding something.

Oliver: [mock surprise] Wow. You mean to tell me that the best investigative reporter at the Daily Planet—the one who literally knows you better than anyone—has figured out you’re sketchy? Shocking.

Clark: [groaning] It’s not that bad.

Oliver: [grinning] Clark, she basically kicked down my door and interrogated me when she thought I was The Blur. She’s tenacious. If she thinks something’s up, she won’t let it go.

Clark leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees.

Clark: I know. And I hate lying to her, Ollie. But I can’t tell her yet. It’s too dangerous.

Oliver watches him for a beat, then his smirk fades slightly.

Oliver: [genuine] Look, man. I get it. But Lois? She’s tough. Probably tougher than both of us combined. Keeping her in the dark might protect her for now, but... you sure she won’t just figure it out on her own?

Clark exhales, shaking his head.

Clark: I don’t know. Maybe.

Oliver claps him on the shoulder.

Oliver: Just be careful, alright? Because if Lois does find out, and she realizes you’ve been lying this whole time?

Clark grimaces.

Oliver: [grinning] Let’s just say, I’d rather take my chances with kryptonite than deal with that fallout.

Clark groans, leaning back against the couch.

Clark: You’re really not helping.

Oliver just laughs.


***


The Next Day – The Daily Planet

Lois is at her desk, flipping through notes when Clark walks in, coffee in hand. She doesn’t even look up before speaking.

Lois: [casually] Took you long enough, Smallville. I was starting to think you needed a GPS tracker.

Clark rolls his eyes, setting the coffee down in front of her.

Clark: [smirking] Maybe I just needed a break from your endless interrogations.

Lois takes a sip of the coffee, humming in approval.

Lois: Mmm. Smart move, but you do realize this only makes me more suspicious, right?

Clark just shakes his head, amused and exasperated all at once.

Clark: Lois, not everything I do is a grand conspiracy.

Lois: [grinning] That’s exactly what someone in a grand conspiracy would say.

Clark just chuckles, watching her. Despite the teasing, despite her relentless curiosity, he wouldn’t change a thing about her.

Lois Lane would figure out the truth someday.

He just hoped that when she did, she’d still look at him the same way.

I'm planning a move from Boise to San Diego and would love some input. I work remotely and would get a cost-of-living adjustment, so the higher cost of living isn't a huge concern. Boise, ID is getting up there with COL, tbh. I'm currently paying $2k + $175/mo for parking for a 1bd/1 bath.

My main motivation is escaping seasonal depression and being close to the beach. I was born and raised in Idaho, and I still haven't been able to adjust to the winters here. I've visited California many times and know San Diego is the right fit for me. It's like a calling I can't ignore, if you believe in that sort of thing.

These are my preferences:

* easy access to hiking trails and the beach
* a friendly and welcoming community (I'm single and eager to meet new people and make friends)
* walkable/bikeable to restaurants, coffee shops, farmers markets, grocery stores, etc

**Budget:** $2.5k - $3k

I have a colleage who I have a crush on. But first and foremost we are close friends and she often refers to me as her best friend. Shes shy reserved and quite specific with who she chooses to spend time with. If she doesn't like you, you will know it. She doesn't really have many close friends except from me and a few others, which is what she's admitted herself.

She's 11 years older than me and has 2 young kids.
OUR relationship is weird. She's obsessive and gets jealous easily. She doesn't let people saw meet her kids etc. Im really close with her kids and help them with school work etc. She shares everything about her kids with me, it's like I'm a whole other parent. We go out for coffee etc and 
We have a flirty friendship and people are constantly telling us to 'Get together' etc. We are eachothers work soul mates and find any excuse to do things together etc

Anyway about a year ago she told me she had a crush on a guy, and she told me after I told her about a hot girl I was becoming friends with (I'm a lesbian) I was obviously upset about this crush of hers so I confined in a friend's who then accidently name dropped the crush to X

(Let's call her X) . Understandably, X went crazy. She said she wasn't going to tell me anything every again.  I apologised, and after a week of her ignoring me both professionally and personally we got back on track. I understand why she was mad that time she confided in me and I told someone else. 

Before today our relationship has been amazing and we've been closer than I ever thought possible. Like in 3 years of knowing her our relationship has never been stronger. She even let's me see her kids and they ask for me all the time. She says I'm like a father to them and she is super protective of her kids. We were planning to go bowling together (again) 

Until yesterday 
She told me last week about a colleages new boyfriend she told me obviously it was a bit funny because this colleague is married but it's no secret she loves to flaunt her latest flings I saw this colleague today and thought she said something about her boyfriend so I asked 'Oh the columbian one?' she laughed and just went 'Oh did X tell you' I laughed and went yeah. This colleague was NOT annoyed of anything, but then I was like oh... Was I not supposed to know... 

Ten mins later I get a text from X saying 'Why would you ask her about her boyfriend I'm not telling you anything anymore' which is the exact same wording as last time she did this


I saw her today and she blanked me. Called me by my real name instead of a nickname and kept making snarky comments and saying 'Oh do you hear someone talking'

She's such a red flag but I'm the only person who knows her intimately as I do. I know everything about her and she has said as much. She's terrified of being known. 

Everyone at work asked what was going on between us because they know we're eachothers shadow. She said 'NOTHING. NOTHING IS WRONG.' 

I feel like my entire world is ending and I wanna cry I'm so anxious to see her at work again. Nothing I say is right and I've had enough ",1,1739825535.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

The juicy bits will be in the blog I’m going to share. This isn’t about sales, however, it’s more about how to build the business.

Step 1: Niche
Basically, separate yourself from the generic candle products. Have you noticed supermarket candles are so plain and boring, and they sell them really cheap. You're  not going to compete with the wholesale retailers. So specialize. A niche could be Christmas candles or candles to wake you up in the mornings (coffee scented). Festive, health and personalised are all niches.

Step 2: brand, brand, brand.
Your brand is your identity. How you communicate your product. What colours do you use. Your name and logo. 
I suggest using AI religiously in the first phases of starting a business. Ask chat GPT if your name works then ask it to suggest some more. Do that with all the parts of your branding. Name, logo, typography, colours and mission statement (this is all you). Finally, packaging. Get inspired by other brands. Do you want All white packaging with your logo. Do you want cardboard boxes, what will you use to fill your boxes? etc.

Step 3: you now have the bulk of your business. Next step is production and I’ll make a separate post about this topic. It’s very detailed. But think about things like your budget, don’t spend too much at first (under 500), start by making a few test candles to get your scents and mixtures right. There’s a science to it.

Step 4: legalities. You need to properly label your candles to account for the ingredients and safety hazards etc. I can show you all this in the next post. Legalities also covers finding a name that’s not taken.

Step 5: sell. I suggest Amazon because c’mon everyone’s on there. Look at some of the other candle sellers on there (not just the big known brands) and get inspired. Remember there’s no such thing as copying in business really, inspiration is what you need.

Read part 1 of this blog and please ask me questions.
Part 2 will go to the next level.
Also please share this to as many candle lovers as you can.

Selling candles is actually a doable side gig and it’s better if you love candles in the first place. There’s lots of testing scents and it can be really enjoyable.

* Any favourite record stores?

* If we were to spend one day wandering around one neighbourhood, somewhere we could kick about and browse spots like coffee shops, book shops, other smaller mom and pop spots, grab a pint—where should it be? 

* Any LGBTQ spaces (bars, cafes, other spots) we should check out?

I've been using a new coffee and I after aggggeeesss and a lot of coffee I got it properly dialed in and it was great, but it's been quite inconsistent which isn't the grinder because I got a DF54 which has been much better than the old Sage built in grinder. When I use pre Infusion its more consistent but I'm not sure whether to use it or how many seconds to do.

For Information I use 18g of coffee to 33g in 24s (This is the sweetest and most balanced ratio) my puck prep is a distributer tool followed by a self levelling spring tamp with a pressure of 10kg

I made a post on here a couple of days ago saying that I really enjoyed my first day of training. I’ve since completed training (yay!) and had my first day at my store today. I was mainly on warming and POS, and while I really enjoyed what I was doing, I couldn’t help but feel so clueless and slow. It would take me so long to do one thing that another partner would often have to step in and help me with my station. 

I know that the expectations weren’t that high since it was my first day, but I would love to hear any tips anyone has for me to help move the process along as smoothly as possible. I’m especially struggling with all the tasks of POS. At the store I trained at, there were virtually no Doordash orders coming through, but at this location it feels like they are constant, and remembering to take orders and brew the hot coffee and pack the orders is really difficult for me and I often end up forgetting something. Does anyone have like a system of sorts for themselves to help keep on top of all these tasks?

Thanks so much for your responses and help in advance! I might be worrying too much about everything because I tend to put a lot of pressure on myself, and I know that a lot of this will go easier with time. My SSV told me just to take things slow, so I need to work on doing that too even when times get really hectic. My biggest fear is just being in other partners’ way or not pulling my weight, so I just wanna make sure I can avoid that as much as possible.

This is my 3rd money diary, and it’s been cool to see how things have changed since the first. There are some recurrent threads, like each year we’ve watched The Traitors during the money diary week. This year they’re only releasing 1 per week, which is annoying: I want to binge! I’ve made good progress with savings from last year to now, even as I’ve spent over $10,000 on home repairs. Several years ago, that would have put me in deep debt or in an unending cycle of deferred maintenance that so many Americans find themselves in. We also traveled a lot last year, spending roughly $11,000 (joint) on trips to Puerto Rico, the UK and Ireland, NYC, as well as several long weekend trips to Atlanta, Savannah, and Chattanooga.

# Section 1: Assets & Debt

Retirement Balance: \~**$74,642.35** in 401K**, $3,177.50** in HSA. I’m currently contributing 15% to my 401K and $125/mo to my HSA. I know I should max it out, but I’m just not quite there yet.

Equity if you're a homeowner: **\~$50,000**

Savings account balance: **$20,082.65**

Personal checking account balance: **$5,875.09**

Joint checking account balance: **$4,663.81**

Personal credit cards balance: **$5,174.99** \- This balance reflects the remaining payment to the contractor for Hurricane Helene repairs & rebuilding our carport. I pay the balance in full every month, so no debt is being accrued. It’s why my checking account is so high right now, because it will be paying this balance.

Joint credit card balance: **$2,342.99** \- Again, we pay the full balance every month.

Student loan debt: **$4,863.32**

Auto: Since the last diary, I’ve paid off my 2015 Honda Fit! I will drive it until it dies a natural death far, far in the future (fingers crossed).

# Section 2: Income

**Income Progression**: 

January 2012-December 2013: Worked part-time after graduating at $12/hr for a property management company. It was hard to find jobs in my field (advertising/media) at that time.

December 2013-November 2015: $32,000 as an ad sales assistant. Severely underpaid but that’s ad sales. The benefits were good at this job. I had one small raise in late 2014, $34,000.

December 2015-April 2017: $48,000 

September 2017-March 2020: Hired at $40,000 as a national account coordinator, received a small raise to $41,500 in October 2018 and another February 2020 to $43,150.

March 2020-April 2023: Promoted to marketing coordinator role at $55,000. Received raise in June 2021 to $58,000. No raise since then, but a performance bonus in March 2022 of $6000.  

May 2023-Present: Hired at $72,500 in current role, and have had a slight COLA since then. With incentives/bonus, last year I made right at $84,000.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home aka Net Pay**: **$3,815.65**

My partner and I combine (most) household expenses, so we share a joint credit card and joint checking for that purpose. But we do not have combined overall finances, so for the sake of the diary, I’ll include his income ($150,000/yr) but I do not have visibility into his personal purchases nor his personal accounts. 

# Section 3: Monthly Expenses 

**Joint Expenses:**

Mortgage, including home insurance: **$1590.35**

Electric/Gas/Water/Sewage: Average **$150-250** depending on season. 

Pest Control: **$37.80**

Wifi: **$45**

Subscriptions: Netflix (+ my mom) **$25.97**; Peacock **$1.99**; NYTimes **$4**; iCloud **$0.99**

Pet expenses: **$31.86** for pet insurance; other expenses average $**130** each month

Car insurance: **$390** for the next 5 months, likely $425 next renewal?

Student loan: **$164.50**

Cell phone: **$50**

Unlimited yoga membership: **$59**

Donations: **\~$25**, I’ve been doing Lasagna Love for the last year+ and the supplies to make the lasagnas work out to about this every month. 

Annual termite bond: **$225**

Annual credit card fee: **$95**

Annual LesMills+ subscription: **$119**

Annual YNAB: **$98.99**

Since I YNAB, I have sinking funds for various joint and personal planned expenditures.

# Section 4: Money Diary 

**Day 1: Saturday**

6a - I wake up, because I’m hot: do I hear the ceiling fan? No. Huh, that’s weird. I open my eyes and quickly realize I can’t see anything, so I check for the red light on our TV, and yep, the power is out. Try to fall back asleep but it doesn’t work. Check my phone, and the power company sent a text saying the expected restoration time is 9:45a.

7a - R and I decide we’ll feed the dogs, load them in the car, and go off to a national park (somewhat) nearby. We pick up breakfast sandwiches and coffee from Dunkin’ on the way. **($15.06, joint)**

9a - We make it to Congaree National Park, and R stamps his National Park Passport while I get the pups ready for a long walk. We recently discovered that both dogs gained a significant amount of weight in the months since Hurricane Helene, likely for these reasons: our dog park is still closed, our normal hiking trails are closed, and I stopped walking them much in our neighborhood because in the month after the hurricane we had 6 instances of aggressive, unleashed or roaming dogs come at us on our walks. It terrified me, and I kept to a very short and safe route after that. In the past 2 weeks, I’ve tried to walk them more and reduce their kibble until they slim down to their normal, lean selves.

11a - Walk was lovely, and the boys are pooped. On the way back home, we stop by Trader Joe’s in the closest “big” city, so I can grab some staples for us and a few things for my mom: smoked paprika, lentils (for mom), artichokes (mom), farro, hand cream (mom), lavender hand sanitizer, and I also see a chocolate & PB nut mix that I have to try. **($33.57, joint)**

12:30p - We’re home! I want a nap but first we decide to bake a Freschetta Hawaiian pizza. R turns on a preseason MLS game while I take a shower, and then it’s nap time.

4p - Since we’ve eaten poorly so far today, I decide we need green goddess salmon bowls for dinner. Off to Lidl for the goods, plus some extra: cedar plank salmon (the best!), sweet pops tomatoes, lettuce, chickpeas, black beans, tomato paste, avocados, Greek yogurt, and a can of dry shampoo **($32.08, joint)**

5p - I decide to make some Greek yogurt bagels I’ve seen on social media, using Skinnytaste’s recipe. Very easy and they look bagel-ish but we’ll see when I use them tomorrow morning. I then prep the roasted chickpeas and rice for tonight’s salmon and get R to help me clean the kitchen a bit. While the salmon is in the oven, I meal plan for the upcoming week and schedule a grocery pickup for tomorrow.

10p - After dinner, a couple episodes of Grey’s Anatomy (I gave up on season 5 originally, but R is a big fan, so we’re rewatching and on season 8), and a chocolate cupcake, we turn in for the night.

**Day 1 Total: $80.71, joint**

**Day 2: Sunday**

6:45a - Little Dog (LD) starts to get antsy and wakes me up in the process. Guess it’s time for breakfast! R and I feed the pups, and then I get started on our sausage & egg bagel sandwiches. I decide they’re certainly not bad, but only with an egg or something to kind of hide the tangy flavor. But they’re not a terrible option to have around!

9a - We finish The NY Times Sunday crossword in 34 minutes, not our absolute best but definitely quicker than average. R gets most of the clues, but I’m good at figuring out the patterns.

10:30a - I stop by my parents’ house to drop off a couple of the things I bought for her at Trader Joe’s yesterday plus one of the bagels and a few of the chocolate cupcakes. After visiting a few minutes, I head to yoga for a flow class. It’s really balanced, and I enjoy the 75 minutes.

12:15p - After yoga, it’s Kroger pickup time! It’s the busiest time, so while I wait, I listen to the free preview of the new episode of Diabolical Lies with Katie Gatti Tassin and Caro Claire Burke. As usual I’m fascinated by their insights and analysis of the new right wing, but I just haven’t decided whether to subscribe. This is one of my contradictory/hypocritical traits, in that I believe people should be paid for their work but have a hard time personally divesting of $8/mo when there are free options available. **($63.79, joint)**

2p - As I take out the leftover salmon, rice, and chickpeas, I realize I’ll have to eat it cold. Our microwave went poof about 2 weeks ago, and I’ve been mostly OK with using our toaster oven, but rice doesn’t reheat well in it, and I’m pretty hungry so I don’t want to wait long either. R and I have both looked into microwaves, and it certainly seems like all of them are expensive junk these days, so we can’t decide what to get. Plus it must be pretty small, so it’s led to decision inertia.

5p - Since it’s Super Bowl Sunday, we’re having chicken nachos. I put chicken thighs in the Instant Pot, because it’s the easiest way to get shredded chicken. While I’m doing that, R purchases ATL United tickets for a few weeks from now. My best friends, and one of our closest couples, are moving later this year, so we’re going to visit them in Atlanta before they move out west. We all love ATL UTD, so this will be fun. R also invites an old friend. **($381.10 joint, of which $225 will be reimbursed)**

6:30p - We eat our chicken nachos while watching SB59. It bores me quite quickly, so I start searching for an elevated bench or platform that I can make into a dog bed that will go next to our king bed. Both LD and Big Dog (BD) sleep with us, but it disturbs R’s sleep, so I’m trying to find a way to slowly get LD to sleep less close to us. After not finding anything, I pick up my current read: Happy Medium by Sarah Adler. I’ve just started, but it’s cosy and cute so far.

9:30p - We ended up turning off the game, since it was a real snooze fest so we check one more time before heading to bed: I think the birds have this one.

**Day 2 Total: $444.89 ($225 to be reimbursed)**

**Day 3: Monday**

6:45a - Normal morning routine: feed the pups, make my coffee, scroll reddit/insta for a bit, and shower.

8a - Backyard playtime followed by breakfast (the last Greek yogurt bagel and cream cheese, it’s \~fine\~) and logging into work. A couple clients reached out after hours on Friday, so I knock those out and then enjoy a slow morning because Mondays, amirite?

11a - My federal refund has been deposited. Wildly unexpected, because I filed only 10 days ago. Friends have also Venmoed me for their tickets. Feels like a mini windfall!

Noon - Already hungry, so it’s nacho time. At least I remember ahead of time to use the toaster oven. In my hunger, I also decide the avocado from the grocery pickup yesterday is ripe enough, but I am proven wrong. Nachos and my daily mini Dr. Pepper Zero fuel me for 3 afternoon meetings. On one of them, someone asks if we can do a “barter situation.”  After that meeting, I take the pups for a walk around the neighborhood and enjoy the mostly sunny 60\* weather.

5:15p - R gets home, and I sign off. After we feed LD & BD, we’re off to Lowe’s. My mom bought us a light fixture for Christmas that we don’t like and want to return, but no one can find the receipt, so hoping we’ll be able to get store credit and then buy a new microwave. But nope! I guess Lowe’s won’t let you do that. Afterward, we stop by the fancier Kroger and pick up floss, ziploc bags, and crystal light, all of which somehow didn’t make the weekly list. I wasn’t paying attention to the cost and let R pay, but now I realize he put it on his personal card. Since he bought the big packs of Crystal Light and floss, I’m assuming it was close to $50. He will not ask for reimbursement.

6:30p - On the way home, the check engine light on my car comes on. It briefly came on last week, so I went and got a quick scan that said it was emission related. The mechanic said that a lot of those codes are misfires, so he cleared it and said to come back if it came on again. Guess I’ll be making an appointment. I also decide, even though we don’t “do” Valentine’s, that I want to use the opportunity to go to a nice sushi restaurant that we never remember to make reservations for and then the waitlist is 2 hours long and we end up going elsewhere. Obviously they’re booked for Friday, but I make a reservation for Saturday.

7p: I quickly throw together tonight’s dinner: one-pot sausage, corn, and spinach orzo, from Skinnytaste. We eat while watching a Grey’s episode and start winding down for the evening.

**Day 3 Total: $0 but also \~$50?**

**Day 4: Tuesday**

6:35a - LD paws me in the face until I get up, but he becomes unhappy once he realizes he still has to wait until 7 for breakfast. I make my usual latte and check with R to see if he minds if I eat the last of our frozen pumpkin pecan mini loaves. He does not, so I let it thaw. I read a bit of Happy Medium (still cozy, still cute) before going out to play with the pups.

8:30a - The first email I see is from one of my international clients thanking me for sending their annual report and asking if I can consolidate this year’s report with prior years’ reporting. I did it last year because it was a new contract for a larger scope and stipulated I’d do a historical pull on the first delivery, but this company likes to continuously ask for small favors or discounts that eventually become big headaches, so I’m going to have to nip this one in the bud.

11:15a - Even though it’s cold and misty, I decide now is the best time for our walk. After a week or so of glorious “false spring,” it feels particularly cruel.

1p - Heat up leftover orzo and prepare for an especially tenuous call with a client I just inherited. Hopefully I can win them over, but I am also pursuing an internal opportunity that I hope pans out, so I’d at least like to try to solve one of their longstanding issues before they transition to another person.

6p - I was supposed to go to a pop power yoga class, but it’s rainy and cold, and I don’t want to, so I thaw out some chicken pot pot filling, throw some biscuits on top, and get it in the oven. When R gets home, he greets me with a gift: the succulents Lego set! For our first Christmas, he got me the orchid set that we have displayed in the living room. Glad to have another set we can put together, together.

8p - Yet again I browse for both microwaves and elevated pet beds. Still no decision on either. Maybe I should get one of the fancier microwaves that can convection/air fry and replace our large toaster oven with a small regular toaster? Decision fatigue is real.

9p - Call it quits and go to bed. I finish Happy Medium - if you like a cozy romantic, semi-fantasy with an enemies to lovers trope, give it a try!

**Day 4 Total: $0**

**Day 5: Wednesday**

6:45a - Normal morning routine. Today’s breakfast is avocado toast with a fried egg and everything but the bagel seasoning.

12p - After a long morning of internal meetings, we take a walk to the lake behind our house. It’s yet again cold and rainy, and I feel meh. Come back and heat up some leftover nachos and quickly try to eat it before my next set of meetings.

3:30p - It’s time for an afternoon snack, so I decide to try the chocolate peanut butter nut mix I bought at Trader Joe’s. It’s good but not great, which is perfect, because it means I won’t keep going back for one small handful after another.

5p - Log off and look into badge reels for R. His broke recently, so he’s been using his Grinch one, and it’s getting too far past Christmas for it to be considered cute or whimsical. I buy 2, one for his college team and one for his NFL team. I also buy a new floodlight for our rebuilt carport. ($50.25)

5:30p - We’re supposed to go trivia tonight, but R gets home late again and wants to skip for the same reason I skipped yoga last night: it’s cold and rainy, and he just doesn’t want to. Fine by me! We’re very much homebodies when we’re home, but we travel often, which I feel like is a nice balance.

7p - Since we’re staying home, it takes a while to decide what we want for dinner: leftovers or takeout. Out of left field, I decide I want stovetop Mac & cheese, so I make that and R decides to combine it with the leftover nacho chicken. It’s delicious, from Gimme Some Oven if you ever want a super quick stovetop Mac & cheese.

**Day 5 Total: $50.25**

**Day 6: Thursday**

7a - It's raining heavily, so the boys let me sleep a few extra minutes and then decide it’s too wet to go out to pee. I make Banana Nut muffins from Krusteaz protein pancake mix. It still needs some tweaking, but we’re getting closer! 4g of fiber and 6g of protein per muffin.

8:30a - Dive into some reporting for a client until an all hands meeting. After that’s over I join a training for a portion of our business that I will need to know more about in the upcoming months, especially if I get the internal opportunity.

12:30p - It’s finally lunchtime! I was so hungry during my last call, so I guess the protein & fiber from the muffins didn’t quite do the job. Although now I realize I haven’t drunk hardly any water - oops, I will have to chug some now and refill this afternoon. Last year I was chronically dehydrated, and though my bloodwork was normal, there were a few higher markers that my physician (and R) thought were likely due to mild dehydration, so I’ve been really trying to drink more water since.

1p - Hallelujah the rain is gone! The pups demand a walk, so we take a stroll around the neighborhood. We technically have a park in the neighborhood where we used to let them off leash, but it was bought last year, and the new owners put a padlock on it last month. I hate that the dogs don’t understand why we can’t go in and play.

5:25p - This afternoon has felt like a gauntlet, and it’s like a weight has been removed when I close my laptop. Technically I’m off tomorrow, but I have just a few small things to wrap up and then I also need to prepare for the final interview round for the internal opportunity next week.

6:45p - Tonight’s dinner is Korean turkey bowls, with additional coleslaw, over toasted sesame rice. It’s one of the meals I make most frequently.

**Day 6 Total: $0**

**Day 7: Friday**

7a - Ah, I meant to wake up earlier to make R breakfast! Luckily, he’s already running late, so I have time to cook while he’s in the shower. Yet again, it’s avocado toast with a fried egg, and I send him off with a banana nut muffin since they weren’t ready before he left yesterday morning.

8a - It’s quite chilly out, so the dogs aren’t super enthused about backyard playtime. I figure I’ll take them for a long walk along the river in the early afternoon. We’ll see if that actually happens!

9a - I do a bit of housekeeping and organizing and then take an early nap with the pups. Then I watch some TV before finally starting to prep for my presentation interview next week. 

11:30a - The boys are ready for some activity, so we take a long walk around the neighborhood. Guess we won’t be making it to the river afterall. We go back home, and I heat up some leftover turkey bowls. I’m starting to get used to the no toaster oven thing; we’ll see how long R lasts.

4p - Where did the last few hours go? I honestly have no idea. I definitely get sucked into reading political news for a while, and I did watch a couple episodes of High Potential, but like a whole 4 hours? Hmm. 

5p - I start on stuffed zucchini. It’s not really a hard dish to make, but it’s a ton of work. By the time R gets home at 6:15, it’s ready to bake. I start on the riced cauliflower, but it looks like it won’t be enough so I add some flour, orzo, milk, and parmesan to turn it into a creamy, garlicky pseudo-risotto. Whatever it is, it’s delicious!

7p - Before dinner, I give R his badge reels, and he loves them! We eat while watching the newest episode of the Traitors and then watch the newest premiere of Love is Blind. All in all, a perfect Valentine’s :) 

**Day 7 Total: $0**

**Weekly Total: $575.85**

Food + Drink: $144.50 (plus \~$50 on R’s personal card)

Fun / Entertainment: $381.10 

Gifts: $21.59

Household Necessities: $28.66

After reimbursement, though, the weekly total is **$350.85**.

**Reflections:** 

I think this was a pretty average week for us. Since being with R, I’ve stopped purchasing as many random things as I once did. I think before him, I would go shopping to have an activity to do but that’s not a real need for me anymore. We would normally go to a nicer dinner one weekend night & have takeout once on a weeknight, so that was a bit different this week. Sometimes we’ll put our date night dinner on the joint but most times R picks those up, as he did the Saturday night directly after this week. I know this was probably a boring read for most of you, but I’m really proud of the progress I've made in the last 2 years!",8,1739824057.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,1.0,False

I'm experienced with single-origin light roast drip coffee but new to espresso. I'll be sourcing high-quality, freshly roasted beans from Subtext Coffee Roasters in Toronto.

I'm considering the Breville Bambino Plus as my first espresso machine due to its price and positive reviews. My primary goal is pulling excellent double espressos. While I'd like to make cappuccinos a few times a week for my mother, the espresso's black flavor is my priority. Does the Bambino Plus fit this need, or is there a better machine in a similar price range that prioritizes espresso quality while still offering a decent steam wand?

If the Bambino Plus is a good choice, I need advice on essential accessories to maximize my espresso quality. I'm happy to replace any included accessories with higher-quality versions. I'd like a comprehensive list of recommended tools for distribution, WDT, tamping, portafilter baskets, etc. I want to purchase everything in one order.

My planned grinder is the Baratza Sette 270. Is this a good choice for espresso in that price range, or is there a better option?

Essentially, I'm looking for a complete setup, including the machine and grinder, plus all necessary accessories for consistent, easy-to-use espresso making. Please recommend everything, even if it seems minor, unless it's genuinely unnecessary.",2,1739824041.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1irtvx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dui/comments/1irtvx6/kdrama_actress_kim_saerons_death_is_everything/,Kdrama actress Kim Sae-ron’s death is everything that is wrong with the hyper-stigmatization of DUIs,"Some of you may have seen that Korean actress, Kim Sae-ron passed away yesterday at the age of 24.  Her death has confirmed to have been a suicide.  Almost certainly this is largely due to the relentless cyber-bullying and social stigmatization she has received over the past 3 years since she got her DUI, where she crashed into a transformer, interrupting the electricity of 57 nearby shops.

Now everyone here knows driving under the influence is blatantly wrong and a crime that endangers many peoples lives, and which kills thousands of people every year.  But also many of you, including myself, have gotten DUIs and know that we are not bloodthirsty killers, but made a choice of poor judgment and want to change for the better and make amends for it.  Kim Sae-ron personally visited and compensated all 57 stores that were affected by her crash, she was turned down from all future Kdrama roles, and even turned down from working at a local coffee shop trying to make ends meet.  Now some of this is includes societal issues that exist in Korea unrelated to DUIs specifically, but I wanted to talk about the social issue with DUIs

My issue is that even after paying the punishment of a DUI, you’re still seen as a monster.  I’ve seen people claim that a DUI should be charged as attempted murder.  What about speeding and distracted driving then?  Both of which have been proven to be more dangerous and which cause as many, if not more, fatalities in some cases.  The issue with the  “what-ifs”, is people get on their moral high-horses and outrage over DUIs (which is warranted and understandable to a degree, but I believe if you’re genuinely remorseful you shouldn’t have to be permanently crucified), but then the same people go and speed 80 down the freeway, or text and drive (which has been proven to be 6x more dangerous than Driving under the Influence, which nearly an 18x slower reaction time).  I have a friend who at first was judgemental about my DUI a bit, but regularly goes over 100 mph down the freeway and other roads.  I really don’t know anyone who has not sped at least once in their life, even if it’s slightly.  Even going 80 when everyone is going 70, increased the rate of fatality by 71%.

I just think there is quite a bit of hypocrisy and self-righteousness tied to this.  I have felt very guilty about my DUI, and never want to endanger others or myself ever again, but I also can spot the double standards from a mile away.   People, like Kim Sae-ron, if genuinely remorseful, should be given the chance to reconcile their life and make amends for bad decisions in the past.  The medieval mob mentality and cancel culture is highly toxic and can leads to dark downward spirals in people.  The hypocrisy is also that many people refuse to look at themselves in the mirrors at their own bad behavior, largely because there is less social stigma around their behaviors

Currently, we have a newborn and my wife is a heavy sleeper, so I often take care of our daughter throughout the night and she will take over around 9 or 10 am and let me get a couple hours of sleep to catch up since we're luckily both on leave right now and can stay home. Today I got up around 1pm and started helping with chores since she was doing the same. She mentioned that it's pretty late for coffee at this point and then I immediately felt bad. Yesterday afternoon she had mentioned wanting to go to coffee a few times. She repeated phrase she's used before along the lines of ""if it was important to you, you would have made it happen"". It's always some variant of this. I said I was tired from being up several hours of the night and that if she had told me when I was going back to sleep, I would have happily taken her and napped in the afternoon. She hates reminding me of things that are important to her, and I understand wanting to be thought of. I try to buy flowers and little snacks she likes without her asking, but I'm very bad at remembering things with dates such as when a movie is coming to theaters, and we've almost missed a couple movies she really wanted to see because she would wait for me to remember, and a couple weeks would go by and I would forget, then she would make a huge deal about going alone and it became a whole argument.

I've tried to understand my own flaws, and I feel like I don't even remember big things I care about a lot of the time. If it's something huge like her birthday, a game or movie we've waited years for, sure, I can remember it. But little things in casual conversation with her that I want to remember when the time comes, I often can't. I'll find myself trying to buy her a gift and remembering a conversation we had, but then I can't remember the specifics enough and it's frustrating. I've attempted to remedy this by using my phone notes. I'm not keeping a profile like ""favorite color: orange"", like I know many of her favorite bands etc, but I try to take notes when I learn of an event she's hinting at or when she tells me a gift idea or something she'd like to do. 

Well, an hour later or so she tells me how insulting it is that I have to keep notes just to do things for her and that I can't just do them. I told her I don't think that's fair because to me it's like writing something important on the calendar. She said that she doesn't have to do that for me because things I care about are important to her and she just remembers them. I'm not trying to pull the ""dumb husband"" card, but I really just feel like our brains are wired differently and I'm just trying to do my best to remember things that are important to her. For example, when doing chores around the house I get distracted very easily and she's very good at sticking on task and completing one thing at a time.

5 day trip around March/April?Feb 16, 2025, 7:49 PMSave

I have 5 days to spend around Match/April. I'll be going with a friend. I am more of a adventure type of guy so I like the beaches, forest, hikes, waterfalls (basically anything with adrenaline)

Question- Is everything accessible by [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g291982-Costa_Rica.html)? Is there other options since I tend to get [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g291982-Costa_Rica.html) sick? Buses? Trains?

Is the area mostly english speaking? Like if I am off the beaten path, will I have trouble getting around?

How safe is the country overall?

I heard the mosquitos here can be bad, also other foreign insects, so will I get sick? is there a chance I can infected? How can I prevent it? How can I be healthy and safe and enjoy my short time there from the states. I want to be an explorer and I can walk for long hours, but I also want to arrive home safe without any illness and issues with gangs/etc. I do not have any health insurance even here in the states.

Planning to maybe visit El Pilón, Lagarta Lodge, maybe a coffee tour, see waterfalls/Swim/Surf? [Playa](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g309274-d555759-Reviews-Playa_Manuel_Antonio-Manuel_Antonio_Quepos_Province_of_Puntarenas.html) Coyote, fishing village experience, volcanos, seeing wildlife, etc. I am also not opposed to guided tours but it is only 5 days and I want to make the most of it.

I probably won't stay around the [San Jose](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g309293-San_Jose_San_Jose_Metro_Province_of_San_Jose-Vacations.html) area other than coming in from the airport.

As for accommodations I don't need a resort like experience but what are you suggestions for that? My biggest concern is health coming back so I want to drink clean water and eat good food and don't want to compromise on that so is it recommended against hostels, or cheaper lodging?

budgetwise for the [plane](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g291982-Costa_Rica-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html), hotels, experiences, and food we are looking around 3000$ usd for 2 people. Is this realstic?",1,1739823844.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

1irtnnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1irtnnk/the_mimic/,The Mimic,"Autumn was arriving, and Autumn was loving every minute of it. It wasn’t quite technically fall for another week or so, but the dog days of summer had largely passed without baking her little New England town into a crisp, and an overnight cold front had brought the temperature down into the sixties this particular September morning. Autumn loved the fall, the season her parents had named her after. She loved the hayrides and scarecrows and the entire fall aesthetic, sweater-weather and snuggling with her boyfriend, Paul. Most of all, Autumn loved Halloween. 

Autumn lived for Halloween. She and Paul had gone trick-or-treating every year together since they were children, well before they were dating. Since they started going out in the ninth grade, they regularly wore couples costumes together which were always the talk of any Halloween party they visited. This year, she had several excellent ideas for costumes and was sitting on her porch making a list in her phone so that she could go over it with Paul when he got home from work that evening. Halloween was only six weeks away, after all, and they had to be prepared. 

Better yet, Halloween was her birthday. This year, she would be turning twenty, though Paul didn’t leave his teenage years until the following March. Autumn had never really celebrated her birthday with parties or cake or anything like that - even on her Sweet Sixteen, she celebrated by having her friends over and watching “The Mummy”. Halloween was always more than enough. 

Autumn finished her list of costume ideas, well enough to go over with Paul at least, and stood and stretched. A cool breeze was rolling in off the mountains to her west, and it made her shiver the slightest bit. Delightful, she thought. Bring it on, fall! She popped back into her parents old Cape Cod style home and headed to the kitchen. There, Autumn filled the kettle with water and set it to boil on the stove. Opening the cabinet, she perused her collection of teas, trying to select one that best fit her mood for the day. Settling on a calming chamomile, she set the teabag and a clean mug on the counter to wait for the kettle to boil. 

“Mrrrap!” A little voice chimed up from behind her, as her petite yellow cat Flo headbutted her furiously, angry at the lack of attention she was getting. 

“Hello, Flo,” Autumn greeted her cat. 

“Mmmrap!” Flo responded. ‘Flo’ was short for ‘Cornflower’, but the name the cat had actually been given at the shelter which Autumn adopted her from was ‘Cornmeal’, owing to her yellow color. The changing of cats’ names is very common, and Flo was no exception. 

Autumn picked the cat up and cradled her like a human child. “How’s my baby today?” Flo borrowed her head between Autumn’s arm and her chest and purred contentedly. 

Suddenly, Autumn heard her phone chime in the other room. I’ll get that in a second, she thought. Then, it chimed again. And again. And again. Ding! Ding! Ding! 

“Who is blowing up my phone,” Autumn wondered aloud. She crossed the dining room into the living room and picked up her phone off the coffee table. There were two missed calls and three unread texts from a phone number she didn’t recognize. 

“Autumn,” the first text read, “Paul had you listed as an emergency contact.”

“There’s been an accident at the plant,” said the next text.

The next text made Autumn’s heart drop. “Paul is at Saint Andrew’s Memorial Hospital. Hurry. He might not have much time left.”

There were three days left until Halloween, and Autumn had never felt less festive in her life. Losing Paul had guaranteed this year to be the worst Halloween ever. She had barely left her room since he passed at the hospital, much less left the house. She had no costume ready, and no plans for the holiday. Besides Flo’s company, she was completely and totally alone. 

She laid in her bed staring at the ceiling, doing absolutely nothing. Flo purred happily at her feet, enjoying a nice afternoon snooze. Her second-floor bedroom window was open, letting in that cool autumn breeze that she loved so much. Her cell phone was powered off. It didn’t matter. Nobody had texted her in some time, after the initial flurry of ‘friends’ coming out of the woodwork with their “I’m so sorry for your loss” texts. 

There was a rustling outside of Autumn’s window, and it piqued her curiosity. She sat up on the bed, causing Flo to stretch with a chirp. Through her rustling white silk curtains she could see a dark mass outside the window, the silhouette of a large bird sitting on the windowsill. 

“Hello,” she called to the bird. This was not uncommon, Autumn talked to pretty much every animal she came across. “What’s your name?”

She drew the silk curtain back and saw the pale white face of a barn-owl staring back at her through the window-screen. “Who?” The owl asked. 

Autumn laughed. “I’m sorry,” she said, “Who are you?”

The bird cocked its head and looked her up and down. “Who?” It repeated. 

She knelt by the window, her face inches away from the owl’s, separated only by the window-screen. Flo hopped down off the bed and curiously approached the owl, staying just behind Autumn. Autumn brought her hand to her chest. “My name is Autumn. What’s yours?”

The owl cocked its head the other way and eyed the cat cautiously. Turning to face Autumn again, it flapped its wings out and rushed at the window-screen, letting out a furious screech. “Paul!”

Autumn woke up on her bedroom floor. The window was open, and the silk curtains fluttered in the wind. It was dark outside now, and the light was still off in her bedroom. By the orange light of the street-lamp outside, she could see Flo curled up beside her slumbering away on the carpet. What an unusual dream, she thought, as she picked herself up. 

A frigid gust of wind rushed into the room, whistling through the window-screen and making the curtains dance madly. Autumn shivered as the temperature in the room dropped, and turned to shut the window. Just then, she noticed two curious things. 

First, the sunset had brought with it snow. Fluffy white snowflakes showered down steadily from the sky, which was lower than usual and lit up orange by the city-lights. The world outside was brighter than normal for this time of day, as a matter of fact, and Autumn realized that she had no real idea what time it was. Dimmer than daylight, but much brighter than night, the light reflecting off the snow below and the clouds above had cast the entire town into a state of twilight. 

Second, she gasped as she noticed the form of a tall, lanky boy laying in the snow on her front lawn. 

“Paul!” She cried through the window, forgetting for a moment that her boyfriend was supposed to be dead. Yet, it was definitely him. She would recognize him anywhere. She slammed shut the sash on her window, turned, jumped over the cat who was still slumbering on the floor, and barreled down the stairs, across the living room, and out the front door. Sure enough, there she found Paul laying face-first in the snow. 

Frantically, she helped her boyfriend up as he groaned with effort. That’s when she noticed his condition. His skin was pale, and his lips were blue. He had a gash across his face, starting at his hair-line and crossing his forehead, down across his right eye which was bruised and swollen shut, and onto his cheek where it terminated right where his scruffy blonde beard started. “Paul, oh my God,” she muttered, “Look at you. I thought you were dead.”

“Dead?” Paul asked in a tired voice. 

“Yeah, the accident… the hospital…” She shook her head. “No matter, you must be freezing. Your skin is absolutely pallid and you’re cold to the touch. Let’s get you inside.”

Paul nodded. “Inside,” he repeated between his chattering teeth. Autumn took his hand and led him through the snow up the porch and into the front door she hadn’t bothered to shut behind her. He stopped briefly at the threshold, looking confused. He glanced down at the ground, then around the porch. He looked over his shoulder, then back at Autumn, turning his head ever so slightly. 

“You’re out of it,” she muttered. “Come on. Let’s warm you up.” She took his hand and yanked him across the threshold and into the house.

Autumn set Paul down on the couch and wrapped a blanket around him. “You’re freezing,” she said, noting that his skin was actually cold to the touch. “It’s a wonder you don’t have frostbite already. Let me make some tea, yeah?” 

Paul looked up at her with his good eye. “Tea, yeah,” he said, and nodded his head. 

Autumn smiled at him and headed into the kitchen. “What kind of tea do you want?” She asked. “We’ve got black, earl grey, white, oolong, peppermint, chamomile…”

“Chamomile!” Paul responded. 

“Chamomile it is! My favorite!” She filled the kettle with water and set it on the stove to boil. Wandering back into the living room, she noticed Flo had descended the stairs and was watching her boyfriend. “Look, Cornflower!” she said, “Paul’s here. Didn’t you miss him so much?”

Cornflower dismounted the staircase and cautiously crossed the living room floor, tail limp against the ground. She sniffed Paul tentatively and he reached a hand out to her to get a better smell. The cat acted cautious at first, but after a minute or so of sniffing, she decided that Paul’s scent was good enough and rubbed her head against his hand as if to ask for chin-scritches. 

Autumn leaned against the doorframe watching Paul interact with the cat. As she watched him, she noticed that his head injury, while not seeping with infection or actively bleeding or anything, didn’t exactly look like it was healing well. She cautiously asked, “Hey, Paul?”

Pulled from the cat, Paul looked up at her. 

“What exactly happened?” She asked. “With the accident? They told me that you were dead.”

“Dead?” He asked.

“Dead,” Autumn repeated. “The police called and everything. They told me there was an accident at work, that you had hit your head, and that you had died.”

“I had died,” Paul stated, matter-of-factly, and returned to petting the cat. 

A shiver ran down Autumn’s spine. “Paul?” She asked, cautiously. “Do you remember our anniversary?”

He looked at her blankly. “Our anniversary?”

“Are you okay?”

“Okay?”

“Paul, you’re scaring me.”

Paul looked back at the cat and continued petting her. “Paul,” he said vacantly, “You’re scaring me.”

Autumn was petrified. This thing petting her cat was definitely not her Paul. In one solid motion, she swooped Flo out of his lap, ran past him, and out the door into the snow. The screen door slammed shut behind her, but then she heard it creak open again. Turning around, she saw Paul standing in the doorway, silhouetted by the light streaming out of the house into the dark, snowy morning air. “Paul, you’re scaring me!” He called from the porch, not quite a shout, but definitely louder than before. 

“Stop it!” She shrieked back in his direction. The cat struggled to break free from her grip, but she tucked her tight into her chest. Taking several stumbling steps backwards into the snow which now lay three inches deep across the yard, she began to sob with a mix of horror and despair. 

“Stop it,” Paul responded blankly. 

Flo twisted in Autumn’s grip, and her claw caught the bare flesh of her arm and punctured it. She swore quietly and dropped the cat, who ran right back up to the house. Horrified, she watched the cat approach Paul, but he just idly watched her as she bound up the stairs and back into the screen door. 

“Stop it,” Paul repeated, and took a step forward. 

Autumn let out a piercing wail as she turned and tried to run, but her foot slipped in the mushy snow beneath her and she collapsed onto the ground. She tried to claw her way forward, but was making little progress through the slush. She heard another piercing wail, exactly like hers in pitch and intonation, breaking the dark stormy morning. 

Autumn turned over and looked back towards the house as The Thing That Was Not Paul released its unearthly shriek again and began rapidly, and inhumanly, walking towards her across the yard.

I have specific painkillers described for these but having made every possible lifestyle change I can within the last year or so with some success (I'm talking entirely quit alcohol, coffee, sulphites, fizzy drinks, I've never smoked, I exercise 1 hr every day, sleep on time, eat on time and control my diet, take a mix of supplements which have really helped - Magnesium, CoEnzyme Q10, Riboflavin and 75ug Vitamin D), my migraines now only appear in clusters at the same time (or a few days before) my period.

2 - Extreme low mood / id3ation. I have a diagnosis for anxiety and depression - for years I took antidepressants to help (with varying other side effects). I got to a spot where I was confident enough to come off them in June, and since coming off, I've noticed a pattern - I'm not actually depressed or low for most of the month, but repeatedly around a week before my period, I'm EXTREMELY low. Without writing it out or going into any potentially triggering detail, dangerously low. It hits like clockwork and these episodes are extreme, last about a week, and are partnered with extreme anxiety and nightmares too.

3 - My periods themselves - awful pain beyond measure. Extremely heavy bleeding for 7-9 days each time when off the pill, and up to 2 weeks at a time when on the pill. Less painful while on the pill though recently the cramps have been horrendous. I tried coming off it and couldn't even stand during my period. I managed 9 months off it a few years ago and tried to come off recently and only made it a few days (not ideal, I know). The pain is so severe I can't bear it.

As a package of 3 this is really affecting my life and wellbeing. I am going to ask them to test my hormone levels, but i think that's too generic and they'll tell me the blood test covered it (I'm not sure what that was for). They'll likely ask me to come off the pill, which is fine, but I want to know they're going to look into what's causing me this insane pain before I volunteer that. I've been referred onto a gynae with a long old waiting list - but I'm not sure that's the right place to go given that all 3 of these issues are so obviously interlinked.

My doctor previously just tried to mask each issue separately without further investigation, suggested putting me back on antidepressants, plus beta blockers (for migraines - i've declined this) and prescribed me mefenamic acid for the pain (this did actually help). None of these are going to help me address the issue long term, especially if at some point I decide to start a family. It's got to the point where I'm desperate for help.

I guess what i'm asking is, does anyone have ANY advice on what tests I can ask for next, or any info on similar cases?

I've always been a huge water drinker (over a gallon a day in the summer is easy work for me as a landscaper) besides coffee I rarely drink anything else. However I want to get some electrolyte powder/drops to add to my water but I can't do anything with flavoring. I see there are a few options on Amazon and I just wanted to see if anyone else has a recommendation for the best tasting (or should I say most tastless) option. ,1,1739823441.0,HersWeightloss,2,1.0,False
1irtma6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1irtma6/the_mimic/,The Mimic,"Autumn was arriving, and Autumn was loving every minute of it. It wasn’t quite technically fall for another week or so, but the dog days of summer had largely passed without baking her little New England town into a crisp, and an overnight cold front had brought the temperature down into the sixties this particular September morning. Autumn loved the fall, the season her parents had named her after. She loved the hayrides and scarecrows and the entire fall aesthetic, sweater-weather and snuggling with her boyfriend, Paul. Most of all, Autumn loved Halloween. 

Autumn lived for Halloween. She and Paul had gone trick-or-treating every year together since they were children, well before they were dating. Since they started going out in the ninth grade, they regularly wore couples costumes together which were always the talk of any Halloween party they visited. This year, she had several excellent ideas for costumes and was sitting on her porch making a list in her phone so that she could go over it with Paul when he got home from work that evening. Halloween was only six weeks away, after all, and they had to be prepared. 

Better yet, Halloween was her birthday. This year, she would be turning twenty, though Paul didn’t leave his teenage years until the following March. Autumn had never really celebrated her birthday with parties or cake or anything like that - even on her Sweet Sixteen, she celebrated by having her friends over and watching “The Mummy”. Halloween was always more than enough. 

Autumn finished her list of costume ideas, well enough to go over with Paul at least, and stood and stretched. A cool breeze was rolling in off the mountains to her west, and it made her shiver the slightest bit. Delightful, she thought. Bring it on, fall! She popped back into her parents old Cape Cod style home and headed to the kitchen. There, Autumn filled the kettle with water and set it to boil on the stove. Opening the cabinet, she perused her collection of teas, trying to select one that best fit her mood for the day. Settling on a calming chamomile, she set the teabag and a clean mug on the counter to wait for the kettle to boil. 

“Mrrrap!” A little voice chimed up from behind her, as her petite yellow cat Flo headbutted her furiously, angry at the lack of attention she was getting. 

“Hello, Flo,” Autumn greeted her cat. 

“Mmmrap!” Flo responded. ‘Flo’ was short for ‘Cornflower’, but the name the cat had actually been given at the shelter which Autumn adopted her from was ‘Cornmeal’, owing to her yellow color. The changing of cats’ names is very common, and Flo was no exception. 

Autumn picked the cat up and cradled her like a human child. “How’s my baby today?” Flo borrowed her head between Autumn’s arm and her chest and purred contentedly. 

Suddenly, Autumn heard her phone chime in the other room. I’ll get that in a second, she thought. Then, it chimed again. And again. And again. Ding! Ding! Ding! 

“Who is blowing up my phone,” Autumn wondered aloud. She crossed the dining room into the living room and picked up her phone off the coffee table. There were two missed calls and three unread texts from a phone number she didn’t recognize. 

“Autumn,” the first text read, “Paul had you listed as an emergency contact.”

“There’s been an accident at the plant,” said the next text.

The next text made Autumn’s heart drop. “Paul is at Saint Andrew’s Memorial Hospital. Hurry. He might not have much time left.”

There were three days left until Halloween, and Autumn had never felt less festive in her life. Losing Paul had guaranteed this year to be the worst Halloween ever. She had barely left her room since he passed at the hospital, much less left the house. She had no costume ready, and no plans for the holiday. Besides Flo’s company, she was completely and totally alone. 

She laid in her bed staring at the ceiling, doing absolutely nothing. Flo purred happily at her feet, enjoying a nice afternoon snooze. Her second-floor bedroom window was open, letting in that cool autumn breeze that she loved so much. Her cell phone was powered off. It didn’t matter. Nobody had texted her in some time, after the initial flurry of ‘friends’ coming out of the woodwork with their “I’m so sorry for your loss” texts. 

There was a rustling outside of Autumn’s window, and it piqued her curiosity. She sat up on the bed, causing Flo to stretch with a chirp. Through her rustling white silk curtains she could see a dark mass outside the window, the silhouette of a large bird sitting on the windowsill. 

“Hello,” she called to the bird. This was not uncommon, Autumn talked to pretty much every animal she came across. “What’s your name?”

She drew the silk curtain back and saw the pale white face of a barn-owl staring back at her through the window-screen. “Who?” The owl asked. 

Autumn laughed. “I’m sorry,” she said, “Who are you?”

The bird cocked its head and looked her up and down. “Who?” It repeated. 

She knelt by the window, her face inches away from the owl’s, separated only by the window-screen. Flo hopped down off the bed and curiously approached the owl, staying just behind Autumn. Autumn brought her hand to her chest. “My name is Autumn. What’s yours?”

The owl cocked its head the other way and eyed the cat cautiously. Turning to face Autumn again, it flapped its wings out and rushed at the window-screen, letting out a furious screech. “Paul!”

Autumn woke up on her bedroom floor. The window was open, and the silk curtains fluttered in the wind. It was dark outside now, and the light was still off in her bedroom. By the orange light of the street-lamp outside, she could see Flo curled up beside her slumbering away on the carpet. What an unusual dream, she thought, as she picked herself up. 

A frigid gust of wind rushed into the room, whistling through the window-screen and making the curtains dance madly. Autumn shivered as the temperature in the room dropped, and turned to shut the window. Just then, she noticed two curious things. 

First, the sunset had brought with it snow. Fluffy white snowflakes showered down steadily from the sky, which was lower than usual and lit up orange by the city-lights. The world outside was brighter than normal for this time of day, as a matter of fact, and Autumn realized that she had no real idea what time it was. Dimmer than daylight, but much brighter than night, the light reflecting off the snow below and the clouds above had cast the entire town into a state of twilight. 

Second, she gasped as she noticed the form of a tall, lanky boy laying in the snow on her front lawn. 

“Paul!” She cried through the window, forgetting for a moment that her boyfriend was supposed to be dead. Yet, it was definitely him. She would recognize him anywhere. She slammed shut the sash on her window, turned, jumped over the cat who was still slumbering on the floor, and barreled down the stairs, across the living room, and out the front door. Sure enough, there she found Paul laying face-first in the snow. 

Frantically, she helped her boyfriend up as he groaned with effort. That’s when she noticed his condition. His skin was pale, and his lips were blue. He had a gash across his face, starting at his hair-line and crossing his forehead, down across his right eye which was bruised and swollen shut, and onto his cheek where it terminated right where his scruffy blonde beard started. “Paul, oh my God,” she muttered, “Look at you. I thought you were dead.”

“Dead?” Paul asked in a tired voice. 

“Yeah, the accident… the hospital…” She shook her head. “No matter, you must be freezing. Your skin is absolutely pallid and you’re cold to the touch. Let’s get you inside.”

Paul nodded. “Inside,” he repeated between his chattering teeth. Autumn took his hand and led him through the snow up the porch and into the front door she hadn’t bothered to shut behind her. He stopped briefly at the threshold, looking confused. He glanced down at the ground, then around the porch. He looked over his shoulder, then back at Autumn, turning his head ever so slightly. 

“You’re out of it,” she muttered. “Come on. Let’s warm you up.” She took his hand and yanked him across the threshold and into the house.

Autumn set Paul down on the couch and wrapped a blanket around him. “You’re freezing,” she said, noting that his skin was actually cold to the touch. “It’s a wonder you don’t have frostbite already. Let me make some tea, yeah?” 

Paul looked up at her with his good eye. “Tea, yeah,” he said, and nodded his head. 

Autumn smiled at him and headed into the kitchen. “What kind of tea do you want?” She asked. “We’ve got black, earl grey, white, oolong, peppermint, chamomile…”

“Chamomile!” Paul responded. 

“Chamomile it is! My favorite!” She filled the kettle with water and set it on the stove to boil. Wandering back into the living room, she noticed Flo had descended the stairs and was watching her boyfriend. “Look, Cornflower!” she said, “Paul’s here. Didn’t you miss him so much?”

Cornflower dismounted the staircase and cautiously crossed the living room floor, tail limp against the ground. She sniffed Paul tentatively and he reached a hand out to her to get a better smell. The cat acted cautious at first, but after a minute or so of sniffing, she decided that Paul’s scent was good enough and rubbed her head against his hand as if to ask for chin-scritches. 

Autumn leaned against the doorframe watching Paul interact with the cat. As she watched him, she noticed that his head injury, while not seeping with infection or actively bleeding or anything, didn’t exactly look like it was healing well. She cautiously asked, “Hey, Paul?”

Pulled from the cat, Paul looked up at her. 

“What exactly happened?” She asked. “With the accident? They told me that you were dead.”

“Dead?” He asked.

“Dead,” Autumn repeated. “The police called and everything. They told me there was an accident at work, that you had hit your head, and that you had died.”

“I had died,” Paul stated, matter-of-factly, and returned to petting the cat. 

A shiver ran down Autumn’s spine. “Paul?” She asked, cautiously. “Do you remember our anniversary?”

He looked at her blankly. “Our anniversary?”

“Are you okay?”

“Okay?”

“Paul, you’re scaring me.”

Paul looked back at the cat and continued petting her. “Paul,” he said vacantly, “You’re scaring me.”

Autumn was petrified. This thing petting her cat was definitely not her Paul. In one solid motion, she swooped Flo out of his lap, ran past him, and out the door into the snow. The screen door slammed shut behind her, but then she heard it creak open again. Turning around, she saw Paul standing in the doorway, silhouetted by the light streaming out of the house into the dark, snowy morning air. “Paul, you’re scaring me!” He called from the porch, not quite a shout, but definitely louder than before. 

“Stop it!” She shrieked back in his direction. The cat struggled to break free from her grip, but she tucked her tight into her chest. Taking several stumbling steps backwards into the snow which now lay three inches deep across the yard, she began to sob with a mix of horror and despair. 

“Stop it,” Paul responded blankly. 

Flo twisted in Autumn’s grip, and her claw caught the bare flesh of her arm and punctured it. She swore quietly and dropped the cat, who ran right back up to the house. Horrified, she watched the cat approach Paul, but he just idly watched her as she bound up the stairs and back into the screen door. 

“Stop it,” Paul repeated, and took a step forward. 

Autumn let out a piercing wail as she turned and tried to run, but her foot slipped in the mushy snow beneath her and she collapsed onto the ground. She tried to claw her way forward, but was making little progress through the slush. She heard another piercing wail, exactly like hers in pitch and intonation, breaking the dark stormy morning. 

Autumn turned over and looked back towards the house as The Thing That Was Not Paul released its unearthly shriek again and began rapidly, and inhumanly, walking towards her across the yard.

1irtlys,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irtlys,first solo grocery store trip was a success! (yapped about it in the caption im just really proud of myself),"i (18M) got up early to go pick up some more milk for my morning mocha from the nearby liquor store (something that was near impossible before my new chair), but had a little burst of motivation. so, i ran a whole grocery store trip to trader joes for my mom while she was at work! i ran into a few obstacles, but they were more annoying than truly inconveniencing. ever since returning from westminster week in NYC though, i’ve struggled to complain a whole lot about my city lol. i’ll probably make a separate post for that when i have the energy, because it was a very busy trip. all i can say right now though is that i have an even bigger respect for wheelchair users who live where it snows. im never complaining about my area’s desert weather again 😭 


boarding the city bus was much easier in my new chair compared to my old hospital chair. one thing that is still hard though is the extremely tight turn at the top of the ramp. it makes swiping my bus card a whole mission trying to not roll back down the ramp. 

my new backrest makes it much easier for me to load myself into the transit tiedowns. about half of our busses also have one of those quantum machine thingies, but theyre always facing backwards and it does not help my car sickness. 

my lapstacker has been way more helpful than i expected. i like how i can put it through the little “holes” in the shopping baskets at stores to keep them from slipping, especially with how fast i like to zoom on my chair. on my way back home, it holds my grocery tote AND my stuffed animal (i always bring a stuffed dog with me in public, im high support needs autistic and especially need one when im not with my mom). even when i only have a stuffed dog with me, i like being able to loop the lapstacker belts through a handle on the vests i have for them so they dont fall off my lap and get dirty :)

I MET ANOTHER YOUNG CHAIR USER IN PUBLIC TOO! i was leaving the store and making my way back to the bus station before stopping in a save mart for some water. he had a tilite zr in what appeared to be the “Hyper Blue” color. i wish we got to chat more, but i didnt want to miss the bus. we just wheelied with a wave and went about our days. 

on my way back from the store, a lady parked her car on the city bus designed space on the side of the road. she wouldnt move until the bus driver gave up and parked outside of the parking space, which was very dangerous. as a result, the ramp spit me out in a field of grass instead of the sidewalk it usually does. luckily with my schwalbe tires and my developing ability to wheelie, i was able to get out safely. said lady looked at me in disgust like it was my fault for making her look like a jerk. flipped her the bird and went about my route home. maybe i was being a bit rude but honestly i dont care. im just glad that it happened while i was on the bus instead of another wheelchair user who might not have the same amount of strength or mobility with their chair that i do. 

the pavement in my neighborhood isnt too bumpy which is nice. most major cracks i use as an opportunity to practice wheelie-ing on a whim. i do have a lot of neighbors that like parking their cars across the actual sidewalk instead of fully in their driveways, so that gets annoying. the whole neighborhood is on a slant though, so im usually pushing with one arm when going down the street of my house. 

when i finally got home, the sidewalk was closed for a construction project (that was meant to be completed in 2021) taking place on the sidewalk in front of my yard. we’re constantly struggling with the city failing to tell us when they’re going to be working in front of our house, so i was pretty annoyed. the fence they put on the sidewalk was on the opposite side of the driveway to the actual construction. it’s probably part of their protocol but i was still annoyed from the woman who parked in the bus parking, so i think it upset me more than it should have. 

but yeah! im home now and enjoyed my coffee. currently doing some laundry and getting ready to clean up the house to the best of my physical abilities since my mom has been having rough days at work. clutter and mess makes her anxious so i want her to come home to something more comfortable. shes been my primary caretaker for years and her having to pick up more shifts at work has given me an opportunity to practice my independence a bit more and so far its been successful. if you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading about my morning :) i like rambling lol",58,1739823363.0,wheelchairs,9,0.98,False

Currently, we have a newborn and my wife is a heavy sleeper, so I often take care of our daughter throughout the night and she will take over around 9 or 10 am and let me get a couple hours of sleep to catch up since we're luckily both on leave right now and can stay home. Today I got up around 1pm and started helping with chores since she was doing the same. She mentioned that it's pretty late for coffee at this point and then I immediately felt bad. Yesterday afternoon she had mentioned wanting to go to coffee a few times. She repeated phrase she's used before along the lines of ""if it was important to you, you would have made it happen"". It's always some variant of this. I said I was tired from being up several hours of the night and that if she had told me when I was going back to sleep, I would have happily taken her and napped in the afternoon. She hates reminding me of things that are important to her, and I understand wanting to be thought of. I try to buy flowers and little snacks she likes without her asking, but I'm very bad at remembering things with dates such as when a movie is coming to theaters, and we've almost missed a couple movies she really wanted to see because she would wait for me to remember, and a couple weeks would go by and I would forget, then she would make a huge deal about going alone and it became a whole argument.

I've tried to understand my own flaws, and I feel like I don't even remember big things I care about a lot of the time. If it's something huge like her birthday, a game or movie we've waited years for, sure, I can remember it. But little things in casual conversation with her that I want to remember when the time comes, I often can't. I'll find myself trying to buy her a gift and remembering a conversation we had, but then I can't remember the specifics enough and it's frustrating. I've attempted to remedy this by using my phone notes. I'm not keeping a profile like ""favorite color: orange"", like I know many of her favorite bands etc, but I try to take notes when I learn of an event she's hinting at or when she tells me a gift idea or something she'd like to do. 

Well, an hour later or so she tells me how insulting it is that I have to keep notes just to do things for her and that I can't just do them. I told her I don't think that's fair because to me it's like writing something important on the calendar. She said that she doesn't have to do that for me because things I care about are important to her and she just remembers them. I'm not trying to pull the ""dumb husband"" card, but I really just feel like our brains are wired differently and I'm just trying to do my best to remember things that are important to her. For example, when doing chores around the house I get distracted very easily and she's very good at sticking on task and completing one thing at a time.

My breville grinder has the top burr set at 3, and I took a guess on grind setting 2 to start dialing in.  I purged about 0.5g of the new beans. I weighed 18g beans then ground directly into a preheated and dried portafilter. This dose has been my go to for this basket. I did my typical puck prep with a WDT, distributor, and spring tamp.  I used my typical temp surf on the gaggia. The first shot gave me 36g out in about 40 seconds and it was absolutely delicious.  Later in the day, I made another exactly the same way, and it took over 60sec to get 36g out, the puck stuck to the group head and was kind of sloppy/soupy, and the shot tasted over extracted. I upped the grind to setting 3, purging after, with pretty much same results. Then grind setting 4, slightly improved but still about 55sec, sloppy puck, over extracted. 
I'm still new to brewing at home; this is my second bag of freshly roasted coffee.  Is my tamping inconsistent?

The benefits were amazing. The increased energy and mental clarity was very noticeable. I worked 12 hours a day almost every day for 3 months and slept like 5 hours a day without any problem. At the end the energy almost became a little bit to much. Especially in combination with alcohol or coffee. Almost like a manic episode. I also had a very hard time to handle the attention, which I am not used. It was like they the ladies could feel that I no longer were a slave to my own desires. For example when I were at the ocean one time with my three female friends. I could sense their interest towards me. But the insane part was that a woman/girl that wasnt a part of our group stared me right in the eyes and flashed her p\*ssy at the same time. It was so absurd. My friend did not see anything because she were behind their backs and my friends were facing my direction. I did not tell them either, cause it felt so absurd and I am not even sure they would believe me. It was insane, that stuff has never happened to me before. Im not even a very good looking dude, rather below avarage tbh. The attention gave me hubris after a while, which I am very much ashamed of. When I read post at this sub I understand that the increased attention is a common thing. However I wasn´t aware of that because I hadn´t read up on the subject before I started. I didnt even know that my increase energy and the increased attention towards me were due to SR. I just wanted to deal with my nasty PMO addiction and I faced even harder challanges. Anyways, I have started SR once again. I love the mental clarity and the energy and I hate the way PMO influence me and the way it makes me objectify women. It´s disgusting tbh. But, I am scared that I will face challenges of the same character again, maybe not as absurd as the one at the ocean.

So, to summarize my questions:

1. What to do if/when the energy become to much?
2. How to deal with the increased attention?",9,1739823341.0,Semenretention,2,1.0,False

What instructions were people following without gram scales and timers?,"I'm sure there's a big consistency (and quality) difference to be gained by weighing out beans and timing our pours. But the Chemex has been produced continuously between 1941 and now, so people must have been making a good cup of coffee with it without our modern tools. 

I don't imaging the average person using one at home in the '40s and '50s has it set on a three beam balance with a 45 second hourglass nearby. So what type of instructions would someone be using back then?",2,1739823127.0,pourover,13,0.75,False

1irthow,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1irthow/advice_on_hormone_tests_further_investigation_for/,"Advice on hormone tests / further investigation for connected womens health issues (migraine, extreme low moods and extreme period pain)","Hey everyone, really appreciate this sub and was hoping I can ask for some advice before I attempt (again) to speak to a doctor.

I'm 30F, based in the UK and I have 3 extreme issues surrounding my periods which are undoubtedly connected. I've kept a symptom diary and pretty much tried everything I can and need to go back to ask the doctors for further help.

I've had a cervical scan, cervical exam and blood tests so far and all came back clear.

I take the progesterone only mini-pill, and have done for years to treat extreme pain, but now symptoms are getting worse even while on it, and i'm worried it's causing migraines/low mood too..

My 3 Issues are as follows:

1 - (likely hormonal) Migraines. I am a hereditary migraine sufferer and have been since a young age. I have specific painkillers described for these but having made every possible lifestyle change I can within the last year or so with some success (I'm talking entirely quit alcohol, coffee, sulphites, fizzy drinks, I exercise every day, sleep on time, eat on time and control my diet, take a mix of supplements which have really helped), my migraines now only appear in clusters at the same time (or a few days before) my period.

2 - Extreme low mood / id3ation. I have a diagnosis for anxiety and depression - for years I took antidepressants to help (with varying other side effects). I got to a spot where I was confident enough to come off them in June, and since coming off, I've noticed a pattern - I'm not actually depressed or low for most of the month, but repeatedly around a week before my period, I'm EXTREMELY low. Without writing it out or going into any potentially triggering detail, dangerously low. It hits like clockwork and these episodes are extreme, last about a week, and are partnered with extreme anxiety and nightmares too.

3 - My periods themselves - awful pain beyond measure. Extremely heavy bleeding for 7-9 days each time when off the pill, and up to 2 weeks at a time when on the pill. Less painful while on the pill though recently the cramps have been horrendous. I tried coming off it and couldn't even stand during my period. I managed 9 months off it a few years ago and tried to come off recently and only made it a few days (not ideal, I know). The pain is so severe I can't bear it.

As a package of 3 this is really affecting my life and wellbeing. I am going to ask them to test my hormone levels, but i think that's too generic and they'll tell me the blood test covered it (I'm not sure what that was for). They'll likely ask me to come off the pill, which is  fine, but I want to know they're going to look into what's causing me this insane pain before I volunteer that. I've been referred onto a gynae with a long old waiting list - but I'm not sure that's the right place to go given that all 3 of these issues are so obviously interlinked.

My doctor previously just tried to mask each issue separately without further investigation, suggested putting me on antidepressants, beta blockers (for migraines) and prescribed me mefenamic acid for the pain - none of these are going to help me address the issue long term, especially if at some point I decide to start a family. It's got to the point where I'm desperate for help.

I guess what i'm asking is, does anyone have ANY advice on what tests I can ask for next, or any similar experiences?

Thank you so much for reading. x",1,1739823082.0,WomensHealth,3,1.0,False
