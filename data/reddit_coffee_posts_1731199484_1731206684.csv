1gnqppc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gnqppc,[Longines] Cozy Sunday mornings with this beauty. üå§Ô∏è‚òï,"Sunday mornings, a time for tranquility and reflection, are often marked by simple pleasures. One such pleasure is the ritual of savoring a warm cup of coffee. As the rich aroma fills the air, it invites a moment of pause, a chance to escape the hustle and bustle of the week.

Paired with this comforting beverage, a timepiece like the Longines chronograph adds a touch of elegance and precision to the experience. Its sleek design and intricate mechanics are a testament to the brand's rich heritage in watchmaking. As the watch ticks away, it becomes a silent companion, marking the passage of time with each deliberate movement of its hands.

The contrast between the warmth of the coffee and the cool, metallic feel of the watch creates a sensory experience that is both soothing and invigorating. It's in these quiet moments, surrounded by the simplicity of a well-made cup of coffee and a finely crafted timepiece, that one can truly appreciate the finer things in life.

I've done some research and am considering the following:
* Rancillo Silvio w/ PED, which is $1249 at SCG
* Ascaso Steel Uno, $1595 at SCG

Any arguments for or against one of these options? 

Is it worth to go for the new Silvio Pro X ($1990) or Steel Duo ($1895)? (Or something else in that price range?)

* How much more value would i get from a pressure gauge (considering l'm a newb, but fast learner)?
* Is there another reason I‚Äôm unaware of to step up to a machine in this price range?

For the grinder, I am leaning towards the Df64. 
* Any reason to go more into the grinder vs the machine? (I imagine some people here have strong opinions on this question. I am not informed so excuse this question should it be irrelevant or impossible to answer)

This will be long but it needs to be. I believe that God has given me my voice and my strength back to boldly share my story. This post is for those who believe there are two sides to every story. I'm here to share my side, because I know you have heard the other. I will not tolerate the hateful, nasty, narrative of ‚Äúthere are 2 sides to every story‚Äù. This is to inform everyone reading these posts, including those who are still in the Network, because I know you‚Äôre there. Do not attempt to minimize, undermine, or distort the abuse I endured within the Network and beyond. My experiences are real and valid, and any attempt to diminish or dismiss them is unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. 


I am fully aware that the Network/Vine/North Pines have shared their narratives because it has gotten back to me. It‚Äôs my turn to share my side. 


For years, I have contemplated walking away from all of this. Infact, I had walked away. I deleted most of my social media, unfollowed this Reddit page, stopped praying, stopped wondering what I had done wrong. 


I have been wrestling with whether or not to share the things I‚Äôm about to. I have shared briefly about my time at North Pines and Vine, but not until I started professional therapy did I realize that my story should be shared to those who still attend the Network, those who left, and to families who are wondering what their family members have gotten into. 


Everyone blames my husband and I for blowing things up in the network. Some have even given me the credit for starting LTN, which thanks, I‚Äôm honored, but it was not me. I am going to share the examples that have been used and twisted to further benefit the Network‚Äôs narrative, specifically calling out pastor‚Äôs, churches, and my specific abuse brought on by Nick Sellers, lead pastor at North Pines Church in Kalamazoo, MI.


As you read these examples, I beg you to show me how these conversations and these experiences were Biblical. 


September 2016: Our small groups had just started, and I was attending one of the only college student ones. It was exciting and fun. There was one particular small group member who seemed to not catch onto social cues, who during one week, had walked out of the bathroom, and asked the group for a tampon. To which she was directed upstairs. I hadn‚Äôt thought anything negative about this interaction, as periods are a normal part of being a girl. However, the following Sunday, Nick approached me and said something similar to ‚ÄúHey, I heard what happened at small group this week, can you ask her to not come back? Just say she‚Äôs not ready for church or something‚Äù The way he was talking to me, he was towering over me, as if to intimidate me. I immediately responded with No. He continued to convince me to tell her that she was not a good fit, or ready for church yet. When I pushed back with ‚Äúwhere will she learn to be ready? Where will she learn about God?‚Äù Nick stared at me, and told me to do it anyway. I refused and walked away. 

Mid November 2016: My now husband and I were church planted for North Pines. We fell in love while there, and attempted to talk to Nick about our feelings. My husband was met wit hostility and called demonic for simply kissing me in my car. When I met with Nick in the library on WMU‚Äôs campus, I came forward and told him about how we had kissed in my car. We kept all of our clothes on, we did not have sex, not that it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs business, but just to clear the air, we didn‚Äôt have sex before marriage like some of the stories say. I was fully transparent with Nick, as we were trained to do with our pastors. He responded with ‚ÄúYOU DID WHAT?! I am so so so angry and disgusted with you two‚Äù This was all taking place in a very public library, with witnesses. The conversation continued with me saying ‚ÄúWe hung out, and it led to us kissing, that was it, I‚Äôm not some kind of monster!‚Äù Once I had finished telling my side of the story, He asked if my husband had groped my breasts, if I had touched his penis or not, if he had put his hands down my pants over or under my panties. He demanded that I tell him the entire experience over and over again ‚Äúto get it right‚Äù, while I continued to sit and sob uncontrollably in a room full of strangers. He continued to ask about my body, and my husband's body. He continued with his berating of me and said ‚ÄúI have never been so angry at two people as I am right now. Look what you‚Äôve done. All I want to do right now is line you up on a brick wall and spank you both like you‚Äôre children.‚Äù I should have, and could have gone to the police over a grown man telling a 19 year old female that he wanted to be physically violent with her.  
In that same conversation, Nick proceeded to ask me if I understood the consequences of falling into temptation (of a kiss, not sex remember). I was confused, so he continued with ‚Äúpeople like you will likely have fertility issues. We‚Äôve seen it time and time again. You may even be barren. Who knows if God will allow that for you, since, you know, fell into temptation with him.‚Äù Where in the Bible does it say that it‚Äôs OK for a pastor to say those words? He used his authority to speak ill things over me. Since then, I‚Äôve been blessed with three beautiful babies. I thank God every day that Nick‚Äôs words did not come true. 
Continuing the same conversation, Nick tells me that I can not be in my current small group any longer. When I asked about how to tell others, Nick said ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not great to lie, but how about you tell everyone your schedule changed so now you have to come to my group now? 
This was the end of 2016, my now husband and I felt as though we were ready to get married. We felt good and happy about our decision. Nick did not approve, he had other plans for my husband. These plans included for him to be on staff, and to not be with me. He assumed that I was pregnant (I was not) and that North Pines was no longer our home. We were banished back to Vine after 6 months of starting our new life in Kalamazoo. We did what we were told, and had hope for a family back at Vine. The small group we joined welcomed us with open arms and gave us the love we so desperately needed in that dark time. I still have a lot of love for that group, and I hope you are all safe and healing if you‚Äôre reading this. 


However, the love of that small group did not transcend into love within the church. Please continue to read our experiences. 

February 14th, 2017: We met up with Jackson, our DC pastor (and now a pastor at Christland). We wanted to process the hurt we had endured, however we were met with ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard what Nick had to say, I think things should have gone differently, and you should have gone about this differently. Trust is broken on our end.‚Äù I knew that my voice would not be heard. Jackson continued to tell me that my only serving capacity I was allowed in was janitorial. I was not allowed to work with children, work on the coffee team, or any other team. Janitorial was my only option. 

Summer 2017: I had also found out that a small group leader‚Äôs wife had been gossiping about me, and how she assumed that I was pregnant. Another girl, who is now currently a small group leader, was laughing with an entire group of college students about how ‚Äúall I wanted to do was have a husband to have sex with‚Äù. So if you‚Äôre on here, just know that the people you talk your shit with, still throw you under the bus for all that you do too.

Early Fall 2017: When I approached another pastor (Mike Stephens, current pastor as Vine) about these issues, he barely gave me the time of day in that auditorium. He laughed at me and said ‚ÄúI know all of these people very very well, my wife loves some of them too. They can have their opinions and I think you should be more careful about what you do then.‚Äù I went to him in a Godly manner, approaching it in a way I believe Jesus would have wanted, but I was met with victim shaming instead. 


We stayed for a year at Vine before we felt called back to Kalamazoo. For lack of better words, it was a dumpster fire from the start. I‚Äôm sure there have been stories told about us where we haven‚Äôt been able to say our side, so here is our side of those stories. 

Fall 2018: The reason we didn‚Äôt go to the retreat that year was because my husband and I were not allowed to stay together, they (Nick and Will) wanted us separated. I was pregnant at the time, and because they wanted us separated, they were OK with me sleeping in my car rather than sleeping in the same room as my husband.

Spring 2019: Due to complications, I had to have a c-section with my first child. I was questioned and shamed for having a c-section. They told me it was demonic, that having a medical emergency was a sign of sin lingering, or that I must have been really struggling because I caved and had an epidural. Several moms in the Network told me that it was wrong of me to use modern medicine like that. What would they think if I told them I was on antidepressants (and thriving) now?

September 7th and 8th 2019: The situation ultimately reached a breaking point when my husband received a phone call from Will Miller, now staff pastor at North Pines. He informed my husband that they had enough of my disobedience, and will be setting clear boundaries with me going forward. I knew that I wasn‚Äôt loved or liked anymore, but that was because I was speaking up about things that I cared about, things like Nick‚Äôs abuse, the gossip, the delivery of my child, my body, and why the church wasn‚Äôt involved with our community, as well as why we were still instructed, by Nick, to as ‚Äúnot cleaned up‚Äù people to leave or not attend our church. I was bringing up things that I was sure Jesus cared about too. In the same phone call, Will had also told my husband that I was ‚Äúthe spirit of discontentment‚Äù and that I was ‚Äúleaking out to others and causing all of the divide in the church and ultimately the downfall of the network‚Äù. He talked about my personality being ‚Äúcancerous, like the West Nile virus‚Äù. My husband and I offered to reconcile with Nick and North Pines. We have text messages proving we were willing to meet and speak to North Pines about this. North Pines said no. Ultimately we had to leave. 


I‚Äôm aware that all of this is a lot to read and digest. I‚Äôm also sure that many in the network won‚Äôt read this anyways, but if you‚Äôre still there, thank you for getting this far. To those of you who are reading this, please know that these people I mentioned made me hate myself and made me contemplate taking my own life multiple times. They did that to me. They put so much doubt into my head that I thought I‚Äôd ever come back from it. I didn‚Äôt believe that I was worthy of God‚Äôs love or grace. I lost a lot from the years of abuse I endured, and the years after. 


I beg you to get out. I beg you to share my story with your family members who are in it, and help them get out. There are far better, healthier church communities out there who truly know how to love like Jesus.


I‚Äôm standing here today writing to all of you now because I‚Äôve found healing. My husband has found healing. I‚Äôve been working with a qualified mental health professional for the year, including the last three months of working with a trauma specialist, and I‚Äôve never felt more free than I do now. I‚Äôm thriving, I have three beautiful children, an amazing husband, who despite being told to leave me multiple times by Nick Sellers, has chosen to love me and our beautiful life we‚Äôve created. We are not suffering, like they told us we would. There is a way out.


If you haven‚Äôt figured it out yet, my name is Taylor Chromek. While I am positive my name will never be associated with positive thoughts throughout the network, I do know that my name is known across the network, so much for gossip being a sin, right? I‚Äôm sitting here sharing the truth to what happened to me, but these stories are not the only things that happened to me. These are truly just a small glimpse into the abuse I endured. The spiritual, the physical, the emotional, and the financial abuse that I endured at the hands of Nick Sellers, and the Network. I welcome respectful conversations regarding my journey in the Network, however I will not be defending myself to those who want to push back on me now. You had your chance years ago. 


I‚Äôm finally at a spot in my life where I will not be made to feel guilt or shame around my experiences. I am here, and I am a survivor of the abuse at the hands of the Network. 


Signed,


Taylor Chromek, Survivor

I am a 29Y old Female with a really gorgeous younger sister. She‚Äôs tall, fair and beautiful with really good facial features where as I am on the exact opposite end of the spectrum, she probably got the best of the gene pool where as the case was vice versa with me

I grew up as a really confident girl, I got a good amount of male attention too during my teens and I was never really compared to my sister ever. Infact, I always knew she‚Äôs really beautiful and I was really proud of this, I would even flex her pictures to others to show how beautiful my sister is. 

But during my early 20s , things started changing, I really got bashed for not being ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù 

There were a couple of instances that started shattering my confidence

1. A guy who was trying to impress another friend of mine saw my father at an event and then told her , ‚Äúher father is so good looking, why is she like this‚Äù. The girl in turn told me this in front of the whole group, I really was shattered because that particular day I felt like I was looking my best self

2. I met a guy at a date, the date went fine, he blocked me after going home. Later he messaged apologising to me after months saying he was shocked by how I looked in reality. 

3. I got married and after our engagement , one of my husbands aunt asked him why didn‚Äôt he choose the younger sister instead 

4. We met some friends for dinner recently with my sister and her partner. The friend literally said your sister is so beautiful, you both don‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre related by blood 

5. My husband once said, he is worried about having a daughter because she would be average looking and her self confidence would be less and he doesn‚Äôt want that for his daughter. He really loves himself , he is obsessed with himself and it‚Äôs so diffeent than me, so I am not sure if he was indicating at me de of things that happened. 

6. My husbands cousin met me recently over coffee and told me about how when my MIL was announcing our wedding in the family told them that I am not that beautiful but I am really smart with a good job and how highly qualified I am educationally. She then told me we saw your pictures and we couldn‚Äôt figure out why would aunty say that, you look cute 

It‚Äôs so weird growing up confident and then having your confidence get shattered with every passing day and suddenly I am not able to love myself, I don‚Äôt have the money to change my facial bone structure etc and get into that loop. I have a really really good job and I would say I am the most successful person in my family line.

1gnqe0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gnqe0y/nervous_2nd_date_went_well_but/,Nervous - 2nd date went well but?,"So, It's been a day since I ( M23 ) had this date ( F26 ) and I'm kinda nervous or doubting myself...... Long story short.....

2 weeks back, I was on a train ride home from work. Started randomly chatting to this fairly attractive woman on the train ( I was just in a chatty moo ) which isn't common for me to do. Trains was delayed so I offered her to join me in a Taxi and I'd drop her off, I asked for her number and we'd arrange lunch or coffee..... Few days go buy, She texts and we grab a Coffee. It went went well.... Last night we went out and did Axe Throwing and then went to this Cafe where they do board games. However, Had to cut it short because she's got vertigo and was feeling funny.

I find her very attractive & I'm honestly quite shocked how much I'm into her. I find her funny and very interesting and I'm kinda taken back but also kinda nervous because she's technically a stranger, Or was at least was one two weeks ago.

Anyway, My doubts have crept into my head because we arranged to meet for this coming Tuesday to do bowling and dinner. However, She texted if we could do Bowling ""The week after next"" because she's got a heavy work load and wants to shift this vertigo before doing any activity. So I agreed and suggested we go and watch Gladiator 2 next Friday, Something more chilled and relaxing.... And she agreed to a late showing on Froday night. She said she had a lovely night too aswell..... I think I'm kinda nervous because I'm just trying to figure this out..... Like, I THINK she's into me. I thought her pushing bowling by a week was her tryna get rid of me but she's agreed to go Cinema on Friday instead so she clearly still wants to see me.

I don't know.... I just want some advice on how to approach this. We don't really text in between dates ( We only been on two ) and she doesn't seem big on texting as her texts are very quick and short which is completely opposite to how she is in person, Always talking and engaging in conversation.

It's intimidating because she's older than me, She's a complete stranger and I've loved these first two dates and I kinda wanna know what she's thinking but I also don't wanna rush or Cock this up because I think she's awesome.

# Humans are Weird ‚Äì Blood in the Water

**Original Post:**¬†[http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-blood-in-the-water](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-blood-in-the-water)

Quilx‚Äôtch was quite muzzy from sleep and stared down in perplexity at the water catch basin in front of him. He hiked up his comforter around him, blocking off the fuzzy view of the rest of the massive cleansing room provided for human use. The catch basin really should not be that color, he finally decided, feeling a bit proud of himself for forcing the thought up through layers of sleep deprivation. A stray thought thread suggested that he really should have petitioned the central university for this sector for that assistant when he had the chance, but the blood-berries had been blooming in the south slopes and none of the preservation techniques this base had access to would have preserved the protein structures quite right.

Quilx‚Äôtch brushed the pad of one paw over his primary eyes to dismiss the stray wisps of thought.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting as bad as Human Friend Scotty,‚Äù he said ruefully.

Another stray thought tried to lead him down the path of wondering if human behavior contain was playing a role in his current state.

‚ÄúIt was not as if my University time showed much better behavior,‚Äù he clicked to himself idly.

Bloodberries. Yes, the humans called them that because their eyes showed the glittering orbs as a single color. They claimed it was the same color as their primary circulatory fluid. Now, Quilx‚Äôtch wondered why he was thinking of that as he stared down at the discolored catch basin.

The material for the catch basin had been harvested from the local rocks. Human Friend Scotty had eagerly explained the process.

‚ÄúWe used to have to carve things like this out of larger chunks of rock,‚Äù the human had said. ‚ÄúNow we just grind up the fragments til we get the size we want and then we micro-compress them into shape. Folks like it because it looks like rough granite, smooth with shiny bits inside‚Äù

Quilx‚Äôtch now stared at the shiny bits visible under the coating of fluid.

‚ÄúI think,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch said to himself, feeling a bit uneasy. ‚ÄúThe humans would also call that blood red.‚Äù

He pondered what the substance might be as he walked across the edge of the cold catch basin to gather up his grooming brush and chelicerae pick. He gently pushed the comforter back, letting the harsh cleansing room light sting his secondary eyes as he gently brushed out his hairs. He found his gaze repeated drawn back to the layer of bio-matter, or at least he thought it was bio-matter, in the catch basin. Usually Human Friend Scotty was quite careful about cleaning up after himself. So it might not be biomatter after all. Though Quilx‚Äôtch couldn‚Äôt imagine what Human Friend Scotty would have been doing this early in the morning in the cleansing room. His grooming finished he gathered up his comforter and trotted out to the main sleeping area, massive to his scale, but seeming quite filled by the mass of the human who was currently wriggling into his day clothes.

Quilx‚Äôtch scampered over the spider-walk along the wall and tucked his comforter back into his hammock while Human Friend Scotty arranged his protective outer layers against his hairless skin. That task seemingly complete the human reached down for his foot armor and proceed with a Trisk-check. Quilx‚Äôtch couldn‚Äôt help chuckling anew at that. Why the humans were, to a person, convinced that his kind liked to hide in there foot armor was a mystery, but one that provided far too much amusement on distant base to be probed into too abruptly. That final ceremony over Human Friend Scotty set his binocular vision sniping around the room to locate him.

Quilx‚Äôtch waved to catch the humans attention.

‚ÄúTiny spider friend on his bunk,‚Äù the human stated in the dim but satisfied tone of one fulfilling a checklist.

‚ÄúHuman Friend Scotty,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch interjected.

He knew that if he did not catch the human‚Äôs attention quickly at this time of day nothing would keep the human from bolting for the coffee that was brewing in the cafeteria once Human Friend Scotty had located him.

Now the human visible paused in his preparation to lumber out the door of their room.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up little guy?‚Äù the human asked, fighting back a yawn.

‚ÄúWhy is the catch basin in the cleansing room the color of bloodberries?‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch asked.

Human Friend Scotty blinked slowly as he processed the question. Then his face flexed and his chin lifted with a grin as he clearly parsed the answer.

‚ÄúI forgot to rinse out the sink after brushing my teeth this morning!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSorry bud!‚Äù

The human turned swiftly and went into the cleansing room, which soon emitted the sounds of rushing water. The human came out still grinning.

‚ÄúAll clean!‚Äù He declared. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt happen again!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch said, feeling distinctly uneasy now. ‚ÄúHowever that was not my question.‚Äù

‚ÄúThecolor?‚Äù Human Friend Scotty asked in surprise. ‚ÄúThat was just my blood.‚Äù

The human stared at him with expectancy as he waited the polite six seconds to reply. Quilx‚Äôtch felt himself ‚Äúpuffing up‚Äù as the humans called it and Human Friend Scotty‚Äôs expression rapidly morphed form expectant to concerned.

‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch asked carefully, ‚Äúwere you bleeding into the catch basin this morning as you cleaned your teeth.‚Äù

Human Friend Scotty‚Äôs face lit up with in the way that Quilx‚Äôtch was beginning to understand meant the human had an easy answer to a question.

‚ÄúYou remember I accidentally broke my sonic cleaner?‚Äù he asked.

Quilx‚Äôtch replied in the affirmative. Watching the human first fumble and drop the item on the floor. Then kick it into the far wall, only to finally step on it, damaging both the device and his foot in the process had been very educational on the value of the spider walks the humans insisted on installing in jointly occupied bases.

‚ÄúAnd I told you that I would be switching to the old fashioned method of teeth cleaning?‚Äù Human Friend Scotty went on.

‚ÄúMechanical friction and chemical layering with a brush applicator,‚Äù Quilx‚Äôtch replied, bobbing his head in a yes gesture.

‚ÄúWell, you always bleed a little when you switch back,‚Äù Human Friend Scotty said with a dismissive wave of his hand. ‚ÄúSorry I forgot to warn you about it, and sorry I forgot to clean my blood out of the sink after.‚Äù

Human Friend Scotty seemed to consider this revelation the end of the conversation and without waiting so much as a second for a response turned and left the room, presumably in search of coffee. Quilx‚Äôtch paused, waiting for him to come back and explain...something...anything more about the situation. But the door of their room stayed stubbornly closed.

Quilx‚Äôtch took a deep breath and ran his paws over his primary eyes.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said to the empty air. ‚ÄúFirst I will speak to the base medic. Then breakfast.‚Äù

He only admits to the full truth after I confront him repeatedly. He recently promised to be fully honest after I discovered their relationship was too close, but I caught him hiding interactions again. He says he hides things out of fear of losing me, but I‚Äôm at my breaking point. I love him and want to trust him, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling there‚Äôs always more he‚Äôs not telling me. How do I move forward and believe him?

My husband and I have been together for 9 years (7 of those married). For the most part, he‚Äôs an amazing partner and dad, but there have been repeated issues with dishonesty throughout our relationship, first around hiding porn, and now an emotional affair with a younger female coworker.

The biggest problem for me isn‚Äôt necessarily what he does but that every single time, it takes days or weeks to pull the full truth out of him. He‚Äôs a terrible liar (I can tell when he‚Äôs lying), but he‚Äôs somehow great at hiding things and denying them until I corner him. For me, honesty is non-negotiable because of past trauma, but every time I find out something, it‚Äôs like peeling layers off an onion‚Äîthere‚Äôs always more underneath.

The latest issue involves this younger coworker, ‚ÄúC‚Äù. They‚Äôve gotten closer than what‚Äôs normal for other coworkers. I‚Äôve found out bit by bit that he‚Äôs deleted messages, brought her coffee, shared personal details about our life, and been more willing to help her than anyone else in his office. He claims nothing physical has happened, and I really want to believe that, but it‚Äôs so hard when there‚Äôs always something he didn‚Äôt tell me until I pry it out.

We had a huge confrontation where he swore he would be fully honest and even had a conversation with her to set boundaries. Things were good for a few weeks, and I tried to trust him. But just last week, I found out they were alone together again‚Äîsomething he didn‚Äôt tell me despite promising he would.

He says he‚Äôs scared of losing me, which is why he hides things, but I feel like this is a never-ending cycle. I love him, he‚Äôs my best friend, and we were even going through fertility treatments for a second child, but this is breaking me. I‚Äôve asked him for full transparency, but I feel like there‚Äôs always more he‚Äôs not telling me. He‚Äôs signed up for therapy and is trying, but I don‚Äôt know how to move on if I can‚Äôt trust him.

How do I know if he‚Äôs really being honest now? How do I rebuild trust when he has such a pattern of hiding things until he‚Äôs forced to admit them? I don‚Äôt want to constantly question him, but I‚Äôm exhausted and don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore. Any advice on how to move forward and believe him would be greatly appreciated.

1gnq4e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gnq4e2/a_funeral_directors_grief/,A Funeral Director's Grief,"This morning, I lost the most selfless, kind, and empathetic person I have ever known. 

He was a funeral director for the last 20 years, a retirement job for him actually, having worked for a bank in the first part of his life. Only 71, just entered hospice 4 days ago after learning about a terminal illness 4 days before that.

I met him about 6 years ago as brand new licensed funeral director myself looking for a new job. During my interview, we talked only about history which we quickly found was a shared interest, and nothing of the job itself. I wouldn't describe him as an imposing figure, having only been about 120lbs at full fighting weight. Always dressed smartly with a three piece wool suit and a bowtie, wisps of white hair circling his head, crouched shoulders, shuffling around the old funeral home quickly. Almost never without a cigarette in one hand and his signature coffee cup in the other, or his favorite pen. He was almost a caricature of sorts, and it would be easy not to take him seriously if you didn't know him.

After a few weeks of working alongside this somewhat quiet, slow speaking, and very thoughtful man, I came to realize some things about him. The first thing I realized was the awe inspiring breadth of knowledge he possessed about the profession we shared. There wasn't a single question I asked him that he didn't know the answer to when it came to mortuary law, contract agreements, funeral service regulations, and his most favorite topic of all, death certificate processing. I came to find out quickly that his knowledge was a resource for our city and even our whole state when I started noticing regular phone calls from medical examiners, coroners, and (most surprisingly) state vital record officials, asking him to check over work or solve a complicated problem they couldn't figure out. They knew who to call.

Secondly, he had an amazing ability to truly see and reach people in his own unique way. Often in our profession you will find funeral directors who are overly cocky or way too saccharine sweet, but not him. He was straightforward and to the point. When a family met with him, it could initially come off as off-putting, but at the heart of it all, he was a problem solver. He sees a grieving family, he sees what they need, and he makes it happen. It was that simple. Our families loved him, because he was completely and utterly honest, he gave them what they needed, and he did everything he could to make the services work and honor the person who died. This, in turn, meant that he was a great mediator. When families brought drama into the arrangement room, he dealt with it swiftly and firmly, but never harshly. They always left him feeling lighter.

Third, his complete and utter dedication to the community he served. The funeral home we worked at together served a community that had very little resources, and often times families had no more than a few hundred dollars to pool together for a funeral, especially if it was unexpected. He used his vast knowledge of state and county benefits, as well as money from his own pocket, to make sure they had what they needed. The community knew to call him. Nurses, hospitals, even the medical examiner referred families to us because they knew he would take care of them, no matter what. Not only that, but he. worked. constantly. Easily 80 hours a week, every week, for as long as I've known him. Early in this second career, he got an apartment just down the street from the funeral home so that he could walk down the road and start another cremation after the last one was finished at 2am. But he loved it. This was his passion and his work was his heart, the funeral home was his world. He did all of this, and he never had to. I found out years later he was independently wealthy, and he chose to do this every day.

Lastly, I realized he is far more mysterious and interesting than I had originally thought. He was a story teller, and when he was in a rare moment of respite from working, I could usually coax a story out of him. Mostly stories from his earlier career that took him all over the world. Randomly meeting a man that owned a bar down the street from where he grew up on a Wednesday evening in Panama, accidentally becoming a Baptist preacher for a few hours while presenting bank documents to a church, making a wrong turn into a dry moat around an Irish castle in an old jalopy. I loved hearing his stories, his cadence would change and he would get the most fun glint of mischievousness in his eye. That being said, I believe every word he said, and I know he didn't even scratch the surface.

I have never met anyone like this man, and I know I never will again. He was completely accepting and non-judgmental of others. Those of us who had the honor of working with him, were molded by him, are forever changed. The hardest part of all of this is that he never sought recognition, he was humble and refused any and all attention. We were given strict instructions to not ""go on and on about my life"" after he passes. But he was the biggest light that is now gone, and I can't not say anything, so this is my outlet.

He is without a doubt the most professionally and personally influential person in my life, I will miss him every day. If I turn out to be a fraction of the funeral director and human being he was, I will consider myself unendingly successful. Goodbye, John.",5,1731204560.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

This will affect all retailers, even local farmers, whose imported fertilizers, pesticides, and equipment will also increase in price. Combined with the merger of Albertsons and Krogers likely being allowed under the new FTC, we could see prices skyrocket at local grocery stores. Not to mention that the permanent loss of Ukraine from the market will affect the entire world's grain and fertilizer prices. 

Project 2025, republicans, and musk have all talked about removing social welfare programs, particularly things school lunch programs, SNAP, WIC, Unemployment, and disability payments, putting many at risk.

FDA and USDA proposals would greatly weaken food safety. A major concern is formula, which has a history of being adulterated and has a strong lobby. Even under left wing presidents, with global trade, and with the FDA this has been an issue.

I‚Äôve been doing endurance and strength training for several years, so without wanting to sound arrogant, I have a well-trained physique that probably aligns with the classic aesthetic ideal from most people‚Äôs perspective (six-pack, etc.).

I‚Äôm currently studying in my fourth semester and have been working as a working student for about six months in the field I hope to enter professionally. Since the breakup, I‚Äôve also started a new sport: boxing. Along with sports, my studies, and my job, I have a few close friends rather than a larger friend group. Of course, I know people at university, but those are more casual, spontaneous interactions in the hallway. My free time is spent more individually with people. For example, there‚Äôs one person I met at university with whom I like to meet up. We either cook at each other‚Äôs places or meet at a caf√© and talk about various things‚Äîstudies, future plans, relationships, and dating. Then, I have another friend whom I typically meet up with in the evenings to grab a beer at a bar. With another friend, I go to the gym weekly, and often we hang out afterward, chat, and have a drink. This is just to give an idea of what my life looks like.

In my past, I tended to be more of an outsider during my teenage and school years, with no close-knit group. A big reason for this was probably my early move from Saar, and due to the lack of social involvement, I had virtually no romantic or sexual experiences with women until the age of 22. My first kiss came at 22, and I lost my virginity at 23. Around that time, I would say I underwent a physical transformation, as I started to grow a bit of facial hair and my gym training made me look older and more attractive. That definitely boosted my confidence, and from 23 on, I was able to connect with several women on dating apps. I had around 15 dates, and with about half of them, we had sex on the same night or by the second or third date. It was fun, but it didn‚Äôt really fulfill me. Even back then, and for a few years before that, I had been looking for a relationship and somewhat envied my peers who were successful in that regard.

One of these one-night stands, when I was 24, ended up being my now ex-girlfriend. We hit it off right from the start, kept in touch, and met regularly. After about eight weeks and probably 10-15 dates, she asked me if we were now in a relationship. Since neither of us had been in a relationship before, we both thought, ‚ÄòYes, let‚Äôs try it, I have a good feeling.‚Äô One of the things I liked most about this relationship was that we could communicate openly from the beginning, and I didn‚Äôt have to pretend. I don‚Äôt mean that I was always emotional or anything, but after about six months, I even cried in front of her. It was a very emotional evening; she shared her experiences from childhood‚Äîher father is Turkish, which made things tough during her teenage years, as he was very restrictive, and she also experienced bullying at school (and her mother has breast cancer). She was overweight at the time. (Even now, she is likely around 15 kg overweight, but it has never bothered me, as I find her attractive both sexually and as a person, as it‚Äôs not just about appearances for me). When she told me all this, she cried in front of me, and I, in turn, shared my experiences with bullying and feeling like an outsider at school. Because of how open and supportive she was, I cried in front of her as well.

I want to convey that our communication was absolutely open; there was nothing we couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt talk about.

We also shared the same sense of humor, laughed at the same things, got along well with each other‚Äôs families, and our sex life was flawless. Throughout the two years, I don‚Äôt recall a single week without sex. And the quality of the sex was, as far as I could tell, very enjoyable for both of us, and we harmonized well in that area too, speaking openly about everything and trying new things.

Of course, we argued in the relationship, often about when we could see each other (it was a long-distance relationship) or, for example, when she complained that I didn‚Äôt share enough about my day with her if we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a few days. She felt that regular updates about my life were essential to feel close. Looking back, I remember two significant arguments where we raised our voices, but there was no disrespect, no insults, or hurtful behavior. I found that we were able to argue well together, which is likely essential in a relationship.

The relationship had several challenges. The most obvious one was the distance. I lived in one city in my apartment, and she lived with her parents in another city, 40 minutes away by train. She also had a one-room apartment in yet another city, which was 60 minutes away in the opposite direction, where she studied. About a year into the relationship, she started a job as a working student, which required her to travel once a month to a city 120 minutes away from her parents‚Äô house by train. This meant we mostly saw each other on weekends over the two years and rarely during the week. I would say it was fairly balanced in terms of who traveled to whom, and we made an effort to keep it that way, communicating openly about balancing the travel.

The second challenge was definitely her family. While I got along very well with her family, and she did with mine, her parents had a very challenging relationship and had had issues since her early childhood. They often argued, and her mother would sometimes move out for a month, then they would reconcile, and she would move back. Both in her childhood and now, my ex-girlfriend often found herself caught in the middle and was emotionally burdened by her parents‚Äô conflicts, consciously or unconsciously.

Additionally, her mother has been battling breast cancer for many years, which has been a severe burden for the family and for my ex-girlfriend, who is very close to her mother.

My ex-girlfriend often told me that she felt burdened and exhausted, that she had many expectations to meet. Looking back, it‚Äôs clearer now how mentally and emotionally drained she often seemed, even though she always appeared tough to others. I think this was also important to her.

Now, a brief recap of the breakup: just before our second anniversary, we met at my place. Initially, it was supposed to be a regular meeting. When she came in, I noticed something was off. There hadn‚Äôt been any significant arguments or changes in our intimacy leading up to this. So, when she told me that day that she wanted to break up, I was completely blindsided.

We then had a very long conversation, likely two or three hours, where she shared her reasons.

If someone else were to tell me this story, I would probably suspect that the reasons she gave were just excuses and that another man was involved. I don‚Äôt doubt that this happens often, and people break up when they find someone else. I don‚Äôt deny that this could be the case here, but I don‚Äôt believe she acted that day because she was going home to another man.

Here‚Äôs what she told me: she had been planning to break up for about 8-10 weeks but waited until my exam period was over to avoid affecting my studies negatively. She repeatedly stressed that she still loved me and that it wasn‚Äôt due to a loss of feelings.

Then she explained that she had visited a psychologist two or three times for an initial consultation because she felt she needed it. Of course, no definitive diagnosis can be made at that point, but the psychologist suggested she might have an avoidant attachment style or a fear of commitment, especially given the environment she grew up in‚Äîan unstable marriage, her father‚Äôs infidelities, and strictness, being a Turkish father with a daughter during her teenage years.

She told me she felt overwhelmed and restricted on all sides‚Äîby her student job, by helping her father with his business, by supporting her mother, by her studies, by her mostly female friends both in her university town and her hometown, and by me, constantly meeting expectations without being able to keep up with everything.

When I pointed out that relationships are meant to provide support during hard times, she agreed but said that continuing the relationship, which she would actually like to do, only made her feel pressured. She was crying intensely during the two to three hours, especially when talking about her mother‚Äôs illness and how much it hurt her to break up. She wept so much I had to hold her as she nearly collapsed from exhaustion. I truly believe she was genuine about her feelings of love and pressure.

Afterward, she stayed with me for the entire day and night, and we acted as if we were still a couple. We held hands, laughed together, cooked, and ate together. She kissed me and said, ‚ÄòI love you.‚Äô We even had sex twice that night. In the morning, she hugged me for a long time, looked me in the eyes, said ‚ÄòI love you,‚Äô and told me not to wait for her, kissed me, and left.

Since the breakup, which was six months ago, we have had absolutely no contact. I told her that friendship wasn‚Äôt an option; I could only have contact with her again if it was for a relationship.

In the month following the breakup, I was in shock, very sad, cried every day, and couldn‚Äôt do much. After a month, I created a routine. I allowed myself to grieve actively for 15 minutes daily, then weekly after 2-3 months.

I focused on my studies, improved my grades and took up boxing, which I enjoyed and which introduced me to new people, something that really helped me. I kept up my gym and running routines as I had for many years. I also reconnected with my social contacts as I described earlier.

Of course, the intensity of the sadness has lessened compared to the first month, but I still often think of her, feel sad, and dream about her several times a week. I am far from being over her and still miss her deeply.

A month after the breakup, I also decided to start interacting with other women. I installed a dating app, created a profile, and communicated with matches. My profile is more geared toward something casual (shirtless photos), and in chats, I was open about not being very emotionally available and not really being into one-night stands, but I was looking for something casual with some level of connection where we could have a good time together. Surprisingly, it was quite easy to establish several friends-with-benefits situations over the past six months. These typically involve regular visits at my place, where we cook, order food, start watching a movie, and then have sex. I enjoy the sex; it‚Äôs good for my confidence, and I don‚Äôt regret it.

However, after being with six women this way, I can say it doesn‚Äôt fulfill me or help me move on from my ex, nor does it make me miss her any less. In fact, each time I‚Äôm intimate with another woman, I feel I miss my ex even more, not just for the physical aspect but for the deep emotional connection, closeness, and the routine of a long-term relationship.

To make it clearer, here‚Äôs what I miss. Everyone is different, but I‚Äôve read that people often feel a positive sense of freedom after a breakup, at least after a few months. I can‚Äôt say that I relate to that. I never felt restricted in the relationship, and this so-called newfound ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù hasn‚Äôt given me any sense of joy or relief.

So, what exactly do I miss? I miss getting a ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù message and a ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù message, the routine of having her as my first and last thought each day. I miss saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù before bed, giving her a goodnight kiss, cuddling, and waking up together in the same way. I miss sitting on the couch, scrolling through our photo album, reminiscing about a nice evening we had three or six months ago, and planning future outings together. I miss shopping for a Christmas present, knowing she‚Äôll appreciate it. I miss having coffee and cake on Sundays with her parents. Even at 26, this fills me more than any night out at a club. I simply miss the emotional depth, the romance, the human connection. The sexual encounters I‚Äôve had feel empty to me. Yes, the sex is enjoyable in the moment, but it‚Äôs only physical.

It‚Äôs said that people go through different phases of processing a breakup, including anger. But even after six months, I‚Äôve never felt any anger or resentment towards my ex. The only emotions I feel consistently are deep longing, sadness that she‚Äôs no longer with me, and a lingering sense of emptiness.

I‚Äôm genuinely at a loss for what to do. I exercise, I have social contacts, and my studies and job keep me busy. I do have moments of fun, but when I objectively compare my 24 years before romance and the six months since, with the two years in the relationship, I find that I was consistently happier and more content during those two years. That‚Äôs something I can now observe objectively.

As I mentioned above, I believe her when she said she didn‚Äôt break up because she stopped loving me but because she felt incapable of handling a relationship, overwhelmed by internal and external pressures.

It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she‚Äôs had sex with another man by now, but that doesn‚Äôt upset me. I‚Äôve done the same with multiple women, and we‚Äôre no longer in a relationship. There‚Äôs no reason she wouldn‚Äôt. However, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs found a new emotional connection as deep as ours. I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs in a new relationship, and I still see her posts on Instagram as part of her close friends list, so I would have noticed if something had changed.

Besides these friends-with-benefits, I‚Äôve had 17 first dates over the past six months, but I don‚Äôt feel anything. I‚Äôm just not ready to open up. I keep looking for her in others, which, of course, is unhealthy. It makes no sense to pursue a new relationship when I‚Äôm not emotionally ready and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to a potential partner.

As long as it‚Äôs about casual dating or friends-with-benefits, it‚Äôs relatively easy for me to communicate openly, and I have no trouble establishing that. But I feel that for various reasons, I can‚Äôt date for a new relationship right now.

When I think about how much time, mental and emotional energy, and feeling I invested in building this relationship, it just makes me sad. The thought of starting a new relationship with all its uncertainties‚Äîwondering if I can be myself, whether I have to play a role to seem attractive, the stages of dating, the uncertainties after a few months, and then eventually reaching a comfortable routine‚Äîfeels overwhelming. I doubt I‚Äôll be ready for that anytime soon, even though I know deep down I want a relationship again.

I constantly think about reaching out to my ex. After all, what do I have to lose? I believe our connection didn‚Äôt fail because of a lack of feelings, trust issues, or incompatibility but due to inner and outer circumstances. I understand the general advice to ‚Äúmove on,‚Äù but in our case, I don‚Äôt see why it should apply. If she has followed through with her therapy as she promised and with the changes in her life (she should be done with her studies now, likely started her new job, probably moved out from her parents, creating distance from the factors that burdened her), I see no reason why we couldn‚Äôt have a fresh start without the previous obstacles.

I completely understand the principle that going back to an ex usually isn‚Äôt advisable and often doesn‚Äôt work. But typically, this is due to issues like infidelity, loss of respect, trust breakdown, or fundamental incompatibilities around major life goals like family. None of that applies to us. So, if the obstacles that led to the breakup have now shifted or resolved, I simply don‚Äôt see why a new beginning wouldn‚Äôt be possible.",1,1731202699.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I have a 6 year old rainbow lorikeet. His flight is limited as he wasn‚Äôt given much opportunity to learn when he was young (I‚Äôm his second owner - have had him for 4 years) - he will fly a meter or two but only ever directly to my shoulder when he wants to be close. Walking is his preferred method of travel.

He is extremely close with me and used to bite anyone who wasn‚Äôt me or my ex partner (the previous owner). He‚Äôs grown out of this in recent years however and is generally much more placid.

For as long as I can remember however, he‚Äôs had an occasional habit of jumping/latching onto my hand and biting it when I‚Äôm trying to drink my coffee - specifically when I raise my cup to my mouth. It happens with any coffee cup - there isn‚Äôt a particular one he has a problem with, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to do this with other drinks. 

He‚Äôs only ever done this when sitting on my arm/shoulder so I‚Äôve tried to keep him at distance when drinking my morning coffee and so far this seems to have worked. I haven‚Äôt had an incident in months. Today however was his worst offence yet. I was sitting on the couch with him behind me. I raised the cup to drink the last drop of coffee, and he flew at my face and started viciously biting my face and hand. He‚Äôs gone straight into time out with a blanket over the cage.

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences or knows of any possible reason for this behaviour. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he‚Äôs being territorial of me as he doesn‚Äôt mind when I‚Äôm close with other humans. It‚Äôs just coffee cups.

1gnpekn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticPeeps/comments/1gnpekn/support_levels_self_diagnosis_and_the_experience/,"Support levels, self diagnosis and the experience of a level 1","Please delete this if it turns out that it is unhelpful. Whenever I see people being late diagnosed with higher support needs levels, or people that claim to be higher support needs, with no apparent impairment, it boils my blood. This is because the effect autism has had on my life has been substantial.

I was diagnosed with ASD-1 recently. I have a good support system. My neurologist stresses that for me to meet my full potential, he recommends that I not live alone. Though I won‚Äôt die and can handle my ADLs unassisted, and generally with no prompting. 

When I was a child I was in special ed classes. I was held back in first grade due to not being as developed as other children my age. As a result, I was slightly older than all of my grade related peers.  I wasn‚Äôt able to listen, didn‚Äôt understand authority figures, and couldn‚Äôt make friends. I didn‚Äôt have speech delays. I stayed in some variety of special ed through my entire school career. My special interest is video games, hands down. Engaging in this interest was so disruptive that in middle school, my grades started to struggle significantly. 

In High School I had a GPA of 0.75. I was poorly socialized and maintained 1-2 friends. I still paid very little attention in class. I did have brief relationships, but they generally would end due to not being able to keep up with the normal progression of romance, and I was broken up with. I never graduated high school and got a GED as a condition of maintaining housing at 19 years old.

Through my adult life I struggled with homelessness due to not being able to hold down jobs. My emotional regulation was poor and I would quit, have conflicts with coworkers, or get fired due to poor performance. People would routinely remark on me being odd, and in my younger years, my behavior wasn‚Äôt suitable for working. When I could stay with my oldest friend in the world, she reports that I would play the same game every minute of the day that wasn‚Äôt occupied by some demand. On several occasions she would literally make me stop for purposes of eating, or comment on my poor hygiene. I learned how to properly wash myself in my early 20s. At one point, while staying with my friend, she secured my house key to my shoe due to how prone I was to losing it. I literally would need to take it off to unlock the door.

Luckily I didn‚Äôt have a learning impairment. I was able to channel my special interest into the ability to build computers and understand how technology works. When I turned about 30, I was able to get a job in technology. In my job I‚Äôm able to take breaks often, and even do things like listen to music. I stayed on my friend‚Äôs couch during this time while saving to be able to rent a room. 

I‚Äôm currently married and live in a 2 bedroom apartment because I consider it the limit for what I‚Äôm able to maintain despite my job paying well enough to even buy a home. I don‚Äôt believe that I would keep up with home maintenance if I were to buy one. My wife handles probably north of 90% of the house work, including all laundry. Even though she works, I charge her nothing due to the amount of work she does. We won‚Äôt have children because I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm capable of keeping up with them, and the notion of not being able to engage in my special interests causes me anxiety.

We got me diagnosed after a therapist both told me they felt I was ‚Äúon the spectrum‚Äù and referred me to an autism specialist. During this time I was throwing fits at home about things like my sunglasses being put in the wrong place, and starting fights with coworkers. 

I have strong difficulties with people that think differently from me, and I struggle with masking my annoyance. I end friendships with very little friction. I develop odd paranoia about what others think are random things. I hate elevators, I won‚Äôt take my socks off because changes in texture on my feet are distracting to me. My wife warns me when she grinds coffee or runs the blender because I might randomly be mean after the fact. I have no tolerance for hunger, or if I need to pee in the smallest detectable amount, I will immediately stop what I‚Äôm doing to go fix the issue, and if my wife doesn‚Äôt make coffee in the morning, half the time I just give up and go to the coffee shop. What the fuck is that?

After all of this, I am level 1. So when you tell me you‚Äôre level 2 or 3, and it‚Äôs not apparent, I just don‚Äôt believe you. Especially after I have struggled so much throughout my life. It hasn‚Äôt been all bad, as I‚Äôm married and eventually found my footing, but there have been serious limitations to my life because I‚Äôm autistic. Sometimes I miss social cues, but I‚Äôve listened to level 2 and 3 people not even know what a social cue is. So if you have less deficits than I do, you should be careful about assigning yourself level 2 and 3.

Hi guys, 

I wrote this anecdote for a friend and I'd really appreciate some feedback/general thoughts on it! TIA.

21:07 - Fancy a nightcap?

21:23 - Sure. Mine or yours?

21:24 - Mine. I‚Äôll send a cab.

I had memorised the route to his house: along Embankment, through Trafalgar Square, past Green Park, and then Hyde Park, weave through the backstreets of Kensington. I was nocturnal, so I didn‚Äôt mind a late-night call; it meant less traffic too.

He always squeezed me by my shoulders when I walked through his front door as if he was trying to compress me into a miniature version of myself that he could place on his mantelpiece. I shot a sidelong look at the novels on his bookshelf that I had bought him ‚Äî one was cracked at the spines and stained with coffee. I wondered if he‚Äôd imagined me as the Machiavellian, cunning antagonist or rather the sweet, kittenish protagonist.

I sat at his dining table, absently untangling my necklaces. Meanwhile, he knocked around his kitchen and lectured me about the economic state of the U.K., the next general election, and ‚Äò90s Labour. I nodded and threw in a mumbled ‚Äòyeah‚Äô every so often, as he droned on about fiscal austerity.

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what that means.‚Äô Lies like this silenced him, and if he was being quiet, I was happy. Sometimes I wished he was a little less predictable, less of a fixed reality and more of a mystery. I hate knowing someone else‚Äôs next move; it makes me feel like I‚Äôve taken a part of their being and fused it with my own.

He smiled sardonically, the crow‚Äôs feet by his eyes deepening. I wondered how many other deceitful girls he had smirked at, how many times he had joked in the pub with his friends, how often he feigned optimism in client meetings.

He nodded towards the living room, drinks in hand, signalling for me to follow. When I first entered this house, I had perched anxiously on the edge of his sofa, scared to move or make too much noise. Now, I throw myself down and spread my legs out across him. It‚Äôs hard to recall how I once felt uneasy in this plush room, now so familiar through the lingering scent of Tobacco Vanille and peculiar trinkets lining the shelves.

He occupies my mind daily, but only within the confines of my late-night insecurities and early-morning regrets. Whenever I thought about him getting married, it was always to another woman. Despite this, I still loved the sound of his voice. I cherished the moments when he moaned about work, friends, London. I loved hearing about his favourite new restaurants, where he got his latest suit from, anecdotes on what university was like in the 2000s.

He is one of the few people I genuinely enjoy the company of. I treated him like a mentor, a life coach. I rushed in questions about jobs, salaries, births, funerals, and religion into the pauses between his monologues. I made a silent note of his answers in my head, ready to pluck out whenever I would have to attend my first funeral, interview, or baby shower.

At times, I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was a complete stranger or my closest friend. It was almost a therapeutic dynamic. I spent a lot of time in my own head, and I wore my thoughts on my face.

‚ÄòStop psychoanalysing me.‚Äô

‚ÄòSorry, I can‚Äôt help it.‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat are you thinking?‚Äô

‚ÄòI‚Äôm thinking that talking about your feelings makes you uncomfortable.‚Äô

One of us always tried to dig deeper, the other instinctively pulled away. It was a delicate balance, a dance between closeness and distance. I had once naively tried to strike up a conversation about his father; he didn‚Äôt speak to me for a month after that. His silence told me more about their relationship than his words ever could.

I wrote this anecdote for a friend and I'd really appreciate some feedback/general thoughts on it! TIA.

21:07 - Fancy a nightcap?

21:23 - Sure. Mine or yours?

21:24 - Mine. I‚Äôll send a cab.

I had memorised the route to his house: along Embankment, through Trafalgar Square, past Green Park, and then Hyde Park, weave through the backstreets of Kensington. I was nocturnal, so I didn‚Äôt mind a late-night call; it meant less traffic too.

He always squeezed me by my shoulders when I walked through his front door as if he was trying to compress me into a miniature version of myself that he could place on his mantelpiece. I shot a sidelong look at the novels on his bookshelf that I had bought him ‚Äî one was cracked at the spines and stained with coffee. I wondered if he‚Äôd imagined me as the Machiavellian, cunning antagonist or rather the sweet, kittenish protagonist.

I sat at his dining table, absently untangling my necklaces. Meanwhile, he knocked around his kitchen and lectured me about the economic state of the U.K., the next general election, and ‚Äò90s Labour. I nodded and threw in a mumbled ‚Äòyeah‚Äô every so often, as he droned on about fiscal austerity.

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what that means.‚Äô Lies like this silenced him, and if he was being quiet, I was happy. Sometimes I wished he was a little less predictable, less of a fixed reality and more of a mystery. I hate knowing someone else‚Äôs next move; it makes me feel like I‚Äôve taken a part of their being and fused it with my own.

He smiled sardonically, the crow‚Äôs feet by his eyes deepening. I wondered how many other deceitful girls he had smirked at, how many times he had joked in the pub with his friends, how often he feigned optimism in client meetings.

He nodded towards the living room, drinks in hand, signalling for me to follow. When I first entered this house, I had perched anxiously on the edge of his sofa, scared to move or make too much noise. Now, I throw myself down and spread my legs out across him. It‚Äôs hard to recall how I once felt uneasy in this plush room, now so familiar through the lingering scent of Tobacco Vanille and peculiar trinkets lining the shelves.

He occupies my mind daily, but only within the confines of my late-night insecurities and early-morning regrets. Whenever I thought about him getting married, it was always to another woman. Despite this, I still loved the sound of his voice. I cherished the moments when he moaned about work, friends, London. I loved hearing about his favourite new restaurants, where he got his latest suit from, anecdotes on what university was like in the 2000s.

He is one of the few people I genuinely enjoy the company of. I treated him like a mentor, a life coach. I rushed in questions about jobs, salaries, births, funerals, and religion into the pauses between his monologues. I made a silent note of his answers in my head, ready to pluck out whenever I would have to attend my first funeral, interview, or baby shower.

At times, I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was a complete stranger or my closest friend. It was almost a therapeutic dynamic. I spent a lot of time in my own head, and I wore my thoughts on my face.

‚ÄòStop psychoanalysing me.‚Äô

‚ÄòSorry, I can‚Äôt help it.‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat are you thinking?‚Äô

‚ÄòI‚Äôm thinking that talking about your feelings makes you uncomfortable.‚Äô

One of us always tried to dig deeper, the other instinctively pulled away. It was a delicate balance, a dance between closeness and distance. I had once naively tried to strike up a conversation about his father; he didn‚Äôt speak to me for a month after that. His silence told me more about their relationship than his words ever could.

This evening was parallel to so many that came before, and many that will come after. Him, absorbed in his monologues, and me, listening with a mix of detachment and curiosity. The same patterns, the same conversations, always with an underlying tension I couldn‚Äôt quite place.

As I stretched out across his lap, it hit me how deeply entrenched I was in this *casual* relationship. We were the perfect opposites: he was grounded, predictable, and sometimes distant, and I was restless, searching for meaning in his silences. I knew him all too well, yet not at all.

How long would we maintain the peace? How long before one of us broke the unspoken rules of this connection? Before the dance between closeness and distance tipped too far in one direction?

For now, I was content to leave things as they were ‚Äî just out of reach, teetering on the edge of something neither of us was willing to name.

1gnp1bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ranciliosilvia/comments/1gnp1bl/help_v3_silvia_producing_worse_and_worse_shots/,Help. v3 Silvia producing worse and worse shots. ,"This will be a long post, so thank you to anyone who has any input. 

The issues;

Over time the machine started pulling shots faster and faster, there is no way to slow down the shot even when grinding finer. Coffee no longer tastes good, it still tasted good when it was initially starting getting worse over a year ago. 



I have a v3 Silvia, that is 12 years old. Over the course of a year+ the machine has been performing worse and worse. I'm hoping someone in this sub can help direct me to what issues may be the culprit. I was going to experiment more before posting but my bf just told me he's had enough with the machine so I am posting right now to broaden my knowledge as I can't really seem to find some answers to some of my questions.

  
Some background information;  
I have a 12 year Baratza Vario.  
So initially I thought it was the espresso machine, and then my grinder started squealing and then I felt relief thinking it's the grinder and not the machine. I did the motor, pulley and shim replacement on the grinder, calibrated, and had baratza listen to the video of the calibration to confirm at what point the burrs were touching. This was back in February. The coffee did taste slightly better, and my bf liked the pourover better after the fix. A month ago I replaced the burrs and my bf said the pourovers were way better after the burr swap. The espresso keeps getting worse.

I picked up an encore off FB with carbon steel burrs to dedicate this to pourover and frenchpress, and did a fine grind to try this on the silvia and the espresso was just as bad. I understand the encore is not for espresso it was just a test. Though I do realize I should probably mess with these settings more, but my gut feeling is its not the grind causing 100% of the issue. 

  
Onto what the Silvia has been through in the past year.

The frame rusted through, this led me down the path of frame swapping. During that process I discovered a few things, and recently did some swaps.

  
During the frame swap, I did a deep soak of the grouphead and swapped the gasket for the Rancilio SIlvia one SKU:¬†R\_1007 on espresso parts.  
I also did the New version Rancilio Group head screen with the new nut and screw SKU:¬†R\_1784

While in the machine. The pump was leaking a tiny bit, but not every time. The boiler cables had the plastic spades melting onto the boiler. 

  
I had to remove the boiler screw to move the guts over to the new frame. I messaged espresso parts about the boiler screws, gasket, and looking for the toothed nut that is part of the grounding mechanism to purchase but they have never replied to me.  This whole swap happened back in May. 

  
The first time I turned the machine on after the swap there was a leak, it was evident as the top of the machine became extremely hot, and I could hear something happening (it was the sizzle). I quickly took off the frame and saw a little bit of water around the boiler screw (but not the one I unscrewed so I assume it traveled to it vs originated at it since it was the closest screw). This was the point I emailed espresso parts asking about the boiler gasket kit. I was lucky that when I tightened it two more times along with the top copper pipe that I had to disconnect it no longer had a leak. The espresso was exactly the same after the swap. 

  
A month ago I decided to try again as the espresso is getting worse, there's a lot of gasket leaking (group head )which confuses me as I replaced the gasket with a legit rancilio one. Though reading this subreddit I've seen a few people post that new silvias do leak a bit from the gasket as it needs to be broken in, so I am holding off on doing any swaps yet. I do want some community input on this gasket leak though. It does leak more when grinding finer.

  
I did the pressure gauge hack screwed onto the spout of the portafilter. At this time my sisters husband (the person who gifted me the silvia 9 years ago) gave me his bottomless silvia portafilter. So before opening the silvia up a few weeks ago, I started running the pressure tests.

  
The pressure seemed to only go up to 6bars, water was exploding out of the group head.   
  
I swapped the pump as it was previously leaking occasionally to the Ulka EX5 Solenoid Vibratory Pump. When I ran a blind filter it seemed like the solenoid valve didn't expell as much water as usual into the drip tray as backflushing usually does. The water was still exploding out of the grouphead. I had a new solenoid on hand so I did the swap. The biggest difference with the new solenoid was running the blind filter test created a LOT less explosion out the top of the grouphead, and there was the hiss and dump of water into the tray. 

  
With the pressure gauge there was some leaking but a lot less after the solenoid so I do suspect the solenoid was getting old. Doing the pressure reading it did get up to what looked like 7 bars, but it still goes to around 6 consistently. I know this method isn't that accurate, and I don't have a PID to really understand what's going on. 

  
So my question is... what else could it be? The machine is 12 years old, I want to order the gasket and screws for the boiler, I heard that the heating element could create issues at this age, but am I missing anything else? I don't want to mess with the OBV until I research some more. I've learned so much but I feel like I am missing something here.

  
My plan for the upcoming week is to, buy some stumptown hair bender blend, this is what I learned to brew espresso with. I am also going to ask our barista friend to give me a shot worth of espresso grounds to test on my machine to see if using a high end grinder does anything.  
  
 The shots back then pulled up to 28 seconds, now they pull extremely fast (10 seconds). If I grind finer the coffee foams more on a range of different beans (I can see this now since I have a bottomless portafilter, not sure what happened before this portafilter), it's also more likely to squirt espresso out of the gasket specifically in the left back corner of the group head. I experimented with the temp surfing from pulling right after the light turns off the 30 seconds after, to waiting for that hiss come out of the grouphead before pulling a shot. My bf has been releasing pressure via the steamwand to keep the shot from shooting out too quickly (this is his hack idk if it's indicating anything). 

  
I would like to figure this out on my own before deciding to get the machine properly serviced, but those that had a silvia for 10+ years, what have you found that needs replacing or work, or anyone who's had something similar happen? 

  
I did change the boiler wires to new ones, added the boiler insulator. There's nothing else that has changed besides what's in my post the last 12 years.

It made me wonder if going on online dates for a few years, and sleeping with people who weren't my official ""boyfriend"" ruined my chance of finding a great guy. I've always wanted to settle down and have kids in my mid-20's so I have been in a state of anxiety ridden panic lately especially since my BF asked for a break...

I (F25) recently met a ""perfect"" guy (M26) who had all of the qualities I was looking for. Everything seemed perfectly fine for the first few months that we were together. We had all of the same interests and even had a very similar circle of friends. He also seemed very career focused and was raised catholic. We had met each other's families and everything seemed to be going on track towards a very serious relationship.

One day, we were laying on the couch and he had borrowed my phone to show me an app that he uses for his morning meditation routine. While he was on my phone, he noticed that in my app history downloads, I had everything from Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, Coffee Meets Bagel, etc. This discovery of his began a conversation on how long I was dating people, etc. I had always believed that honesty was the best policy so I shared my dating history.

Unfortunately, he was bothered by the fact that I had slept with people who I wasn't seriously dating and thought that I was not careful enough or didn't value myself.

Since this day, everything has been different and he has even asked for some space. I truly felt like I could see a future with this person so I am very heartbroken by his complete change in demeanor.

He also mentioned that other guys in his position would feel the same and that men would not feel comfortable ""wifing up"" someone who has dated several people online. He basically said that this is a universal male experience and that men are lying to themselves if they say otherwise.

Do you think a girl who has dated around a lot is not ""wifey material""?

Has anyone been in a situation where their GF used to date a lot? And if so, has this worked out for you?? 

Thank you in advance for any input. I am not sure what to do in this situation...

Little backstory....

I know energy drinks are bad for you, but I used to drink them way too much. I quit for a long time, then started drinking them again but in moderation. One evening at work, I started having PVCs, once every.....maybe 10-15sec on avg. I was sick that day, I did take Tylenol Cold and Flu Severe and I was drinking an energy drink...I know, not intelligent.

Anyhow, these persisted all day long for about a week until they just decided to stop. During that week though, I literally didn't drink anything except water and MAYBE a diet mt. dew a week. Never happened again, although I will have the occasional PVC. Fast forward about 3 years, I'm working night shift, I started drinking the white Monsters (the no carb ones, I think it was). Bam.....happened again, can't remember how long I was drinking them, but this time the PVCs only lasted about 2 days.

No more energy drinks for me. I drink coffee every day, in moderation. Anywhere from 1-3 cups a day (the extra cups are only on work days). Both of those times I did end up with an event monitor which captured practically nothing....and I knew it wouldn't (for the most part because I can feel when they happen).

Current situation....

I have kids, I get seasonal allergies pretty bad, I take anti-histamines which is fine. However, I am sick now and my nose is as if I have a rhino rocket in each nostril. I'm SO hesitant to even touch the DayQuil/NyQuil or pseudoephedrine because I don't want these PVCs to kick back in again. I know you can't tell me it won't happen, but I guess I am looking for a bit more knowledge than I currently possess, in regard to my situation.",0,1731200192.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

Think for a moment about who makes your clothes, chocolate, coffee, cosmetics, and electronics, and where the raw materials come from.

If you are in Sweden, your shirt might have been made by H&M. A minuscule fraction of the price you paid went to an impoverished and brutally overworked Bangladeshi woman, so that more of that revenue is available for Swedish wages, profits, and tax revenue.

Imagine for a moment what might happen if the workers in the Global South who provide the West with cheap labour and resources were treated like human beings instead of cattle, and were paid proper living wages and given proper working conditions.

The corporations would be forced to either lower wages or increase prices in order to make up for the lost profit. This would decrease the level of value that flows into the Global North, as less of it would be withheld from the Global South.

This is why it benefits Western corporations and governments to make sure that the Global South remains in poverty- to make sure that there is always a mass of desperate humans who are ready to serve as cheap labour and be treated like cattle, so that corporations can make more money and give more of it to Global Northerners.

It is that simple.

1gnon8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gnon8g/my_uncle_matt_never_existed/,My Uncle Matt Never Existed,"My family and I have been going through a very strange experience over the last couple of months. It's hard to even put into words or explain *what* is going on. I guess I can just start off from where it all started to feel off.¬†



A few months back my family had a big get-together. My parents both have two siblings. They all got married and had some kids. Well, all of them except Uncle Matt. He never got married or had kids. That means I have ten cousins. My aunts and uncles all live within two hours of us so we‚Äôve all grown up together.¬†



That being said, we don't normally have all my aunts and uncles in a house at once, this was a rare occasion to have a family meal when they were all free.



I will not be naming every single family member in this post because that seems like a lot of information and honestly, you've already gotten more information about my family than you ever wanted, but I promise this context is important.¬†



Okay, enough with my babbling. Let's talk about what happened that weird night.¬†



My parents and I went over to my Aunt Margo and Uncle Ken‚Äôs house for a BBQ in the backyard. The backyard felt loud and chaotic. I tried to stay out of the way and get the night over with. I was honestly just there for the free food.



We were all sitting down at a big table outside. I was so focused on making sure none of the napkins went flying in the wind I wasn't listening to the conversation. My aunt Margo came over to the table with a plate of really burnt hot dogs. My mom immediately started to laugh at the sight of them.



‚ÄúIs burning food genetic or something? How on earth do you guys always do that to food? The Jensens need to leave the cooking to the Millers.‚Äù My mom said with a sarcastic giggle. Uncle Ken looked at her confused.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are you on about Liz? Uncle Ken snapped back.



‚ÄúI mean, Margo burnt the hot dogs and Matt always burns food when he cooks. Remember we had to ban him for months from cooking because we had to order takeout like three times in a row.‚Äù Everyone at the table laughed recalling their memories. Sighs of recollection bounced back and forth from person to person when my dad spoke up in Aunt Margos' defense.¬†



‚ÄúHoney, what are you talking about? Matt is your brother. I really shouldn't have to remind you of that.‚Äù My mom rolled her eyes in response to my dad.



I spoke up because I was suddenly confused about which side of the family Uncle Matt was actually on. You would think I would naturally just know that, but all my aunts and uncles act like siblings and call each other their siblings. My grandparents often refer to their son/daughter-in-laws as just their kids so it isn't something I always think about.



‚ÄúWait, I'm confused. Whose side is Uncle Matt on? What is the joke? I don't get it.‚Äù I asked but was only met with a laugh from all the parents at the table. I finally got an answer from my mom following the silence of the joke that somehow went over my head.



‚ÄúDon't be silly baby, Matt is your dad's brother.‚Äù As the words left her mouth half the table looked confused.¬†



‚ÄúLiz, what are you talking about? He is on your side. He is a Miller.‚Äù My aunt Margo said as she scraped off the burnt edges of her hot dog.¬†



‚ÄúOkay, Now I‚Äôm with Amanda. I don't get the joke.‚Äù My mom said while looking at me with narrow inquisitive eyes and then at the rest of the group.¬†



‚ÄúWait, wait, everyone slow down.‚Äù Aunt June said, speaking up for probably the first time in the night. ‚ÄúThis is dumb. Matt is not Liz and I‚Äôs brother. He has to be on the Jensen's side of the family.‚Äù¬†



I sat at the table watching my family in silence. Their eyes darted back and forth. They stopped laughing and were all just scratching their heads.¬†



After a few minutes, my mom got out her phone. She found an old family photo from when she was a kid. In the photo were her, my grandparents, my uncle Paul, and my aunt June. Nothing out of the ordinary. After looking at the picture, Aunt Margo got out *her* phone and looked for an old childhood photo.¬†



‚ÄúAh ha! Found one.‚Äù She stated as she showed off the photo on her phone. Yet again, the photo was normal. It had my grandparents, my dad, Aunt Margo, and Aunt Susan.¬†



The next hour consisted of both sides of the family going back and forth showing photos. None of them with Uncle Matt in them.



I had a few of my cousins there, but they all lost interest once they ate. I on the other hand couldn't be pulled away. I was engrossed in learning where the heck Uncle Matt came from.¬†



They kept talking back and forth. They figured maybe he wasn't anyone's sibling. Maybe he was related by marriage or a second cousin twice removed that I just called ‚ÄòUncle Matt‚Äô because that was the easiest thing to call him. We all have a relative like that, right?¬†¬†



I know an easy solution you might be thinking of is to just call him up. That's also what I said but he was working and they didn't want to interrupt him, but guess what? I needed answers so I decided to call him. However, when I looked at my phone I couldn't find him In my contacts. I looked through it multiple times. I remembered texting him about something a few days back so he should‚Äôve been in my text history. Still nothing.¬†



After being weirded out by his contact being gone, I mentioned out loud that someone should call him. Regardless of him being at work. No one agreed with me, but once I told them his contact was missing from my phone they all got curious and looked to see if he was missing for them too.¬†



We were all in shock to find him missing from all our phones.¬†



The family started to dig through their camera rolls and any digital libraries they had to try and find any photo of him. Uncle Andrew thought he had a photo of the back of him, but we soon found that we all remembered him looking differently.¬†



Uncle Andrew showed a picture of the back of a bald man who looked pretty tall. Aunt June called him crazy and recalled him having long curly red hair.¬†



It wasn‚Äôt like we hadn‚Äôt seen him in a year or that he was some kind of distant memory. I saw the guy last week. He came over to my house to help me with some homework, and I can tell you he didn‚Äôt have red hair or no hair at all, he was, well, shoot... I can‚Äôt remember what he looked like now that I think about it.¬†



It was safe to say we were all creeped out. As the sun went down and it got chilly out, the group moved inside. Normally, this is when everyone would go home, but I saw Aunt Margo start a pot of coffee. It was going to be a long night. The air was tense and full of unease. None of the adults wanted to go home until they had answers.¬†



I could tell the adults wanted to talk more but didn‚Äôt want to worry the younger cousins. My older cousin Maddy clearly didn‚Äôt care about anything that was going on. She just wanted to sleep. We convinced her to take my three young cousins into the basement so they could all get some sleep. But not me, I was invested. Uncle Matt and I are close. We see each other all the time. How could I not have a shred of evidence that he even existed?¬†



As my cousins shuffled downstairs, all the adults huddled around a big whiteboard Aunt Margo slapped on the kitchen island. They started to write down everything they could remember. What he looked like, the last time they saw him, memories of him. None of it was coherent. It seemed he was a completely different person in all our memories. Even if it was a memory where multiple people were around.¬†



One of the only things that we could all agree on was that the Jensens always thought he was on the Miller side of the family and the Millers always thought he was on the Jensen side.¬†



My Mom recalled a story of Matt and my dad going to a lake to fish, but the hook got stuck on Matt‚Äôs hat and went flying. My dad told us he remembered my mom telling him the same exact story many times.¬†



Everyone had memories of stories where he was on the other side of the family.¬†



Soon everyone was on the phone with a new family member trying to tell them the situation and asking what they thought about everything. My aunts and uncles were talking to realities on the phone I didn‚Äôt know I had. Relatives that probably only met Matt a couple times at best. All I heard was one dead end at a time. No one knew where he came from or where he went.



So the big question was *who is Matt?* Was he just some random guy who weaseled his way into the family? Telling one side of the family one thing and the other side another? Or was it something *so* much worse?¬†



As the sun came up that Saturday morning we were all still scratching our heads. The deeper we got into who Matt was, the more freaked out everyone got. I was honestly surprised they let me stay with them all night long.¬†



The more digging everyone did, the farther away we felt. The more rabbit holes we went down the less real he seemed. We couldn‚Äôt find any evidence that he ever existed. Some of us searched all over the internet for ‚ÄòMatt Jensen‚Äô, or ‚ÄòMatt Miller‚Äô and a few of us searched for other last names in the family. Of course, it was kind of hard to know who we were looking for given we didn‚Äôt know what he *really* looked like.¬†



After hours of discussion, we compiled a list of attributes that never wavered about Uncle Matt.¬†



He was a man, he never had a mustache, he was tall, he was bad at math, and he loved Jim Carrey movies.¬†



That might seem like a random grouping of facts, but that's because it was. We couldn‚Äôt even remember where his house was. Some of us completely forgot and others remembered different houses. It didn‚Äôt matter. We weren‚Äôt going to start knocking on doors to find a man we were concerned never existed.¬†



We started to believe that as soon as we began to question who he was he just simply started to fade away into nothingness. Like it was some kind of self-destructive on his own consciousness.¬†



It was around 9 a.m. that morning when people started to fall asleep on couches. The night before started with everyone being determined and saying the night wouldn‚Äôt end until we found Uncle Matt, but here we all were. Exhausted and with little to no answers. It felt like accepting defeat by napping on the couch but we couldn‚Äôt do much else.¬†



At 11 a.m. we all woke up to the sound of my cousins playing in the next room over. We all sat up and rubbed our eyes. You could practically see the gears turning in everyone‚Äôs heads as they woke up from their stupors. I could tell when they realized their memories actually happened and it wasn‚Äôt just a weird fever dream.¬†



My Aunt Margo stumbled to the kitchen while yawning and started to dig in the pantry for something substantial the kids could all eat. It was clear they had alrighty raided the cookie stash.¬†



As the adults had a quiet conversation we heard something come from my Cousin Kass that made us freeze.¬†



‚ÄúYeah, remember last night when Uncle Matt gave us all those cookies! It was so much fun!‚Äù My small cousin said with a hop and a skip.¬†



‚ÄúWait Kass, get over here and say that again.‚Äù My uncle Andrew yelled in an attempt to sound intimidating but came out with a voice crack.¬†



Kass walked over to us looking like a confused puppy who just got yelled at.¬†



‚ÄúWhat did I do wrong Uncle Andrew? I thought if Uncle Matt offered us cookies I could have them?‚Äù



‚ÄúKass, you are not in trouble. This is very important‚Ä¶are you telling me Uncle Matt was with you guys last night?‚Äù Uncle Andrew tried to say in a gentle tone to not scare Kass.¬†



‚ÄúI mean, not the whole night but he brought us all cookies and put a movie on for us. Then he said he wanted to go hang out with you guys upstairs.‚Äù Kass told us with a quiet voice.¬†



Everyone started to frantically look around the room. Looking for any evidence of him being there last night. We quickly asked the rest of the cousins if they saw Matt and some kids did and some didn‚Äôt. ¬†



I noticed something when I started to count the objects in the room. There were ten adults and me upstairs last night. So, there should've been eleven people in total, but I saw twelve plates out with the leftover crumbs from our late-night pizza, twelve spots laid out for sleeping in the living room, and twelve mugs or cups of coffee.¬†



He was here last night.¬†



As I mentioned what I found, my dad said he remembered seeing him last night. He said Matt brought him some water. Uncle Paul said he saw him go to the bathroom but couldn‚Äôt remember him coming out.¬†



They mentioned how it felt like it never actually happened but he managed to place the memory in them after the fact. How else would they see Uncle Matt right in front of them and not realize what was happening?



I had a strange feeling that started to bubble up. I felt uneasy and restless.¬†



‚ÄúWait, something is off here,‚Äù I said loudly to the room. ‚ÄúEveryone line up on the wall, I want to try something.‚Äù¬†



For a second they all looked at me confused. They normally wouldn‚Äôt let me boss them around like that, but they were desperate and tired.¬†



All the adults lined up against the wall. As I walked by then I counted out loud. Something strange happened. I counted twelve people including me. None of the kids were lined up. I wasn‚Äôt counting myself twice. There was an extra person. Uncle Matt wasn‚Äôt just here last night. He was with us in the room at that moment.¬†



Other members of the family even tried to count. We did it over and over again. Even adding one of the kids to the mix, but every single time there was one extra person, but we still couldn‚Äôt see him? How was he hiding in plain sight?¬†



Everyone ended up leaving my Aunt Margo‚Äôs house that afternoon. We were all still extremely creeped out about the whole thing, but what could we do about it? Not much. It‚Äôs not like Uncle Matt ever did anything violent. Mostly normal behavior except for a few memories of him that were kinda weird. One of us remembered seeing him in the kitchen, stacking and unstacking bowls for hours. Another person remembered him once packing for a vacation but his suitcase only had trash bags in it. And I have a memory of us sitting in front of a fireplace with him reading the instruction manual to a blender for a bedtime story.¬†



At least those were the kind of memories we had in the beginning. As the weeks went on, we started to remember things that got more and more concerning. He showed up in our houses in the middle of the night. Or buying us all hammers for Christmas. He once bought hundreds of dollars worth of knives and put them in my Dad‚Äôs car.¬†



Once we developed disturbing memories of him, we tried to tell the police. Of course, they couldn‚Äôt find any evidence of his existence so they couldn‚Äôt help us. It didn‚Äôt help our case that we couldn‚Äôt even give them a last name. How on earth are they supposed to find a guy based on his name being Matt and no physical features



So who is Uncle Matt? I can say with one hundred percent certainty, I have no clue. Is he a man? Is he an entity? Is he a figment of our imaginations? Or is he nothing at all? I don‚Äôt know. And that‚Äôs the worst part of all. He seems to always be around at family dinners. Most of the time I count the number of people I end up with an extra person.¬†

  
He feels like a virus. Always implanting a memory of himself being around but in the moment I never see him.  



It seems to be a family joke at this point. Always leaving out an extra plate for him or something. In my opinion, no one is taking this situation seriously. I know he hasn‚Äôt hurt anyone, but why should we wait for something to happen? I swear I can *feel* it when he shows up. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up. My family has given up on trying to figure out who or *what* Uncle Matt is. But I haven‚Äôt.¬†



It feels like they have all just forgotten the disturbing memories of him. I swear the deeper I dig to find him, the worse the memories get. Like he is rotting and festering in my memories. Right before my eyes. I'm starting to think it's his attempt to stop me from looking for him.¬†The fact that he is punishing me for looking for him makes my concern grow more and more. Why is he suddenly running now that I am on to him? Why is he so afraid of me finding him? And what will happen once I do find him?



I will find you, Uncle Matt. I will find out *what* you are.",27,1731199845.0,nosleep,5,0.97,False
1gnon0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gnon0s/does_my_boss_has_crush_on_me/,Does my boss has crush on me? ,"I have just stared my dream job in amazing team. My boss made good impression on me since the job interview, because besides being a good looking person he has a very nice, and charming personality. With time we found out that we have the same interests, reading the same books, magazines and even listing the same podcasts. Automatically, it leads to many conversations as we are both quite clever. I do really enjoy working with him, and he too, as he told me that one day. 

However, some attitudes of him started to concern me. First and foremost, after few months of working I have already received pretty heavy tasks, which requiring a lot of responsibilities. Moreover, my boss is happy with whatever I am doing, and compliment me one on one or in front of the team that sometimes I am feeling a little bit ashamed/uncomfortable. Of course, he is married! 

Very often, when we talk about work-related issues, he ends by asking about our common interests - whether I've already received a subscription to our favourite magazine in the post, or whether I've already started watching the games of our favourite team. In the past, when he came to work with the dog, he invited me several times to his room (when he was alone) to come and play with the dog or to get a coffee if I wanted to. These kinds of suggestions are not made in front of other members of the team. Recently, when we were on our way back together and with another colleague from a business trip, for example, he asked me what system I had for marking quotes in a book. 

I like this type of relationship, but I'm afraid people might start gossiping. I'm good at what I do and I'm glad I've been given more assignments in a short space of time, but I'm afraid that as a young woman I might be wrongly labelled later.  ",1,1731199826.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1gnomn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1gnomn4/losing_my_mind_how_do_i_believe_hes_telling_it/,Losing my mind. How do I believe he‚Äôs telling it ‚Äúall‚Äù when after 9 years of compulsive hiding and lying. ,"First time posting and apologies it's going to be long. I'm really struggling and don't know what to do. My husband and I have been together for a total of 9 years and married for 7 of those. Over the course of these 9 years we have had repeated issues of him hiding porn and now emotionally cheating. I am at such a loss because other aspects of our relationship are great. He's a great dad and a good husband aside from these things.

A big issue is that with every single instance of catching him, it takes days/weeks to pull the whole truth out of him. He's a horrible liar and easy to tell when he is, but he's EXCELLENT at hiding and denying. So now every time something comes out, I can never believe he's truly telling it all. Because every other time I have had to pull the truth out of him piece by piece. Because of some of my past trauma, lying is a huge trigger for me. I can work through things and handle them as long as you are honest about it, no matter how bad it is.

The first signs/fights over hiding things involved excessive porn use. Once before we were married in 2016, once while we were going through infertility in 2018, and again when my daughter was a newborn in 2020. Ever since the first time I have told him how the porn was a nonnegotiable for me. It damaged my self esteem, my self worth, and it hurt like hell. He explained that to him the porn was his way to relieve stress and he had been addicted to it since he was very young.
He sought therapy and I really think he has finally overcome it since the 2020 incident. I haven't caught him since. I'm also admittedly, I chronic over-thinker.

Fast forward to now in 2024, our big issue is him hiding interactions, texts, and calls with a female coworker. He works as a probation officer  and his office location is next to all the other female officers. One of the females is much younger in age, has less experience as an officer, and is single. We will call her ‚ÄúC‚Äù. He had mentioned C to me before when talking about work in passing. I have even met C last year as I work in public education and she is assigned to come to our school to do safety checks once a week. I noticed towards May that she hadn‚Äôt been by but didn‚Äôt think much of it. In September we were sitting in the living room I asked to use his phone. I truly wasn‚Äôt looking for anything because I didn‚Äôt suspect anything. However I stumbled across that he had deleted a text from her that said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ignore me‚Äù. 

I immediately got upset. I asked if he had deleted text with her and he admitted yes. I didn‚Äôt understand why. Over the course of days (as usual) he admitted that he and her had gotten a little too casual but nothing ever physical. I went through all other calls and text history and realized he had been in contact with her A LOT. Like 10x more than other coworkers. He claimed it was all work and just because they would rely on each others help (they aren‚Äôt partners). But if it‚Äôs just work then why hide it? And why would he want to rely on a small, young, less experienced female officer over the males or females with more experience? He said that the particular text made him realize that they were too casual. Then my mind is thinking‚Ä¶I wonder if she hasn‚Äôt been coming to the school because she doesn‚Äôt want to see me because something is going on between them.
I eventually dug more details out about him and her that do not happen with other coworkers:
-He has at times brought her coffee and her favorite soda.
-A few months ago someone was leaving post it notes on C‚Äôs desk saying hi. It became an office mystery of who was doing it/why. All the other female workers asked my husband if it was him. He said it was not and he went and talked to C about how he considered something like that playful flirty and that he would not do that because he was committed to his wife.
-He has told her things about our personal life like our previous issues with infertility with our first born and how we are going through it again now trying to have a second.
-She has spoken about her sex life and ‚Äúbeing horny‚Äù in front of him. He said it was not directed at him but she openly talked about it while in his presence.
-She has asked him to come into work early because she needed his help immediately with someone being violent towards her‚Ä¶instead of just asking someone already in the office.
-He frequently complains to me about having to pick up the slack of other officers but never her. And based off of what I can see he is always drops everything to help her.

It‚Äôs like I had to piece all of this together for him to show that obviously there was some sort of connection with her that he didn‚Äôt have with others. And that if he has to hide it from me‚Ä¶then it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs inappropriate. He swore there was nothing physical and no blatant flirting. But I said this is it. I told him I was done with the constant lying, hiding, and not being open with me. He begged and pleaded for us to not separate. He promised he was going to be completely open and honest about everything. I asked that he tell her that he thought they were being too casual and needed to be more professional. He did have that conversation with her and she said she understood. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to nag him, or babysit him. I want to trust him. I know he still has to work and have interactions with her. I asked just that if he did tell me if anything happened to just tell me and that if they did have to go somewhere alone together to just tell me.

Things were good for 3 weeks. I didn‚Äôt even ask about her because I didn‚Äôt want to nag and I wanted to trust him. Then last Saturday I brought up not seeing her for months doing school security checks. He made A LOT of excuses for her and it brought up a red flag for me. I finally asked if anything has happened since the last fight about her. He said no. Then yet again, he finally admitted that last Wednesday and Thursday they went alone together to places on assignment. He admitted he didn‚Äôt like it and knew I would want to know. I could scream. IF ITS WORK THEN WHY NOT TELL ME?! At first he said that both times he was ordered by his chief but then admitted that the second time it was because she asked him. He complains about being behind on his own caseload and work but he so willingly drops things to help her? There are 11 other offices besides the 2 of them that she could go to for help. But no, she always goes to him and him to her.

I love him. I consider him my best friend. We were going through fertility treatments again to have a second child. I want to be with him. The last week I have warned him this is it. I‚Äôve barely spoken to him. I‚Äôve made us sleep in separate beds. He has cried and begged and signed up for therapy. He says he doesn‚Äôt tell me things because he doesn‚Äôt want to fight and is scared of loosing me. He also claims he thinks of these things as small and not necessary to tell me. 

I still feel like there is more‚Ä¶because there always has been before. How can I ever trust him? Why does he compulsively lie? I have explained over and over again if he is just upfront with me then I won‚Äôt get mad. What do I do? My mind is spinning, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt sleep. It‚Äôs killing me not knowing if there is more. ",8,1731199793.0,survivinginfidelity,2,1.0,False

IF YOU JUDGE ME THEN... PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME... IF YOU JUDGE ME YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S WRONG! IF YOU READ IT AND JUDGE ME THEN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK AT ALL (that would be possible and probably normal) idk what to say.... just don't judge me. nobody likes to be judged. 

you'll probably think: ew what a weirdo! 

you wouldn't be wrong to think that but i would feel kind of bad... anyway... i can't force ideas into your mind so let your mind wander wherever it wants but pls enjoy this book
(some of it is true some of it isn't... sometimes your mind can create things out of nothing and in the end you're like wtf but it's still amazing bcs your brain is a living world creating machine! it's literally so cool and so creepy at the same time... but anyway, as i was saying, this book (if i can call it a book) is a soup of randomness combining real and fictive worlds, events, persons, places, etc... a soup. 

(the blender is my brain.)
(maybe i'll try to make it less dark because life isn't always dark... sometimes it is but not always... theres a LOT of happiness in the world and we should really (en profiter au maximum). Please stay safe and be happy. 

if ur not, smile for 30 seconds i saw that on yt) 

SMILE and enjoy everything! sadness is good too. its incredible to think that we can feel sadness like woah... sometimes i feel like i don't want to be sad, I want to stop feeling sadness but that would mean stopping living and that's horrible. NOT LIVING. i wouldn't be immortal but not living, giving up, is really sad, too sad... even sadder than sadness itself... compared to death, sadness is a wonderful state, almost like happiness! 

If you're reading this text... then it means that you're really important to me (or that someone sent it to you!) you're loved, never let anyone tell you otherwise!!!!!!!!!!! 

okay, you read a lot (thx!). here's the book: 

(i am sorry for any mistakes/typos.... some of them are intentional but some aren't) 

I hope you'll love it and hate it as much as i do!
I hope i'll like it too

Just a random alley in a random supermarket... well not really... Because V.M. is the biggest supermarket in the world! It's wonderful! When I say ""super"" I mean something like ""on steroids"" or ""on drugs"" because that's really how it is! Visualize cows on a dairy farm. What do the farmers need to do to make more money? They need to produce more milk, but to do so there aren't a thousand ways... So they ""boost"" the cows. Ehanced championship ready top of podium doped cows! That exactly what they do with the V.M., they boost it to the fucking max. 

YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU CAN OWN ANYTHING YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE NO THIS ISN'T A DREAM YOU'RE NOT UNDER THE  INFLUENCE OF DRUGS THE VIRTUAL WORLD EXISTS!!! EMBRACE THIS WHOLE NEW REALITY THIS MAGICAL WORLD IS WAITING FOR YOU!!! DEMATERIALISE TO GAIN MORE SPACE FOR USELESS TRAUMATIZING THINGS! YOU LOVE THE INTERNET AND THE INTERNET LOVES YOU!

-Unreleased/Banned Products! (drugs, humans, weapons...!)
-Entertainement For Humans! (litterature! cinematography! sports! pornography! games! and much more!!!)

alleys never stop appearing at the Virtual Market, it's a never ending cycle. They just appear... They're not there but the moment you blink... thousands of new alleys appear. 

They don't have what I fucking want. I want the fucking cure, the answers. They don't have that, I can only trust myself. DOCTORS NEED TO GET PAYED AND I GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL... (actually does it cost money to go see a doc? probably not... forget what I said...) I can't ask a doctor to give me the cure because it doesn't physically exist... actually the cure could be ""telling my brain to shut the fuck up because I have my own creativity, ideas and my way is special in its own way."" but it's oh so hard to accept this answer, to swallow this pill, to let your body process the molecules.... I HATE IT. I hate overthinking, jealousy, complicated relationships... NOT HAVING WHAT THE FUCK I WANT! Give me what i want. I'm not asking to God or anyone... I'm just asking. ASK AND U SHALL RECEIVEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! Imagine being your best friend, but like actually. You both like the same things, you do everything together, you listen to the same music, you have the same friends.... Imagine liking yourself 100%... but not to a sexual extent... just liking yourself. It probably isn't possible.

it's so weird. being alive. being ourselves. being in our mind. a complex system of organized cells. atoms mixed together resulting in thoughts. which elements cause love, sadness, fear, happiness, shame...? a slimy organ controlling an entire organism. tons of different types or organisms. small ones, big ones.

tastes. i like this and that, i hate this and that. what causes tastes. why thought. why thinking. why why?

what's our purpose?

lulu's hypothesis on the goals of human life (as humans):
  - reproducing.
  - loving.
  - experimenting.
  - thinking.
  - ...
 
i want to change the world.
i want to make the world better.
i want to talk to everyone.
i want to meet everyone.
i want to have everyone's points of view.
i want everything.

i have no talent, no skills.
i'm fucking jealous. i fucking hate being jealous. 
i am so fucking useless, talentless. i wish i was content.
i wouldn't kill myself, but sometimes i feel like i should die if i'm that fucking useless. i think that i won't be able to reach any of my goals before i die.
stop stop stop stop. stop saying that.
it's not true.
i like drawing. my art style is unique i guess...? but other people's are better... ARHWNDKFNDND FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.
I CAN'T FUCKING READ MUSIC I CAN'T FUCKING PLAY ANY FUCKING INSTRUMENT I CAN'T I CAN'T I CAN'T. i'm too fucking lazy. I don't like to work hard. i fucking hate not being able to do something the way i want. i fucking hate that. 

I NEED INSTRUCTIONS TO AWAKEN MY FUCKING CREATIVITY!!!

# *[MILULU'S SAGA]* by lulubenene

# MILULU'S BEACH.
Today, I went to the beach. It was really fun. Water, sand and people.

But something happened.

I was playing a game on my phone bcs i didn't want to go swim, get wet... Yeah I know, I'm boring, but I also really wanted to start playing that goddamn game (Subarashiki Hibi). So there I was, sitting in a tent, hiding from the sun reading a vn. Balls occasionally hitting the tent. At one point, i had to go pee, like I HAD TO FUCKING PEE. I started looking for a washroom. It was located at the fucking exact opposite of where we were. I passed by strangers, barbecues and clouds of flies. THE FUCKING MEN WASHROOM WAS CLOSED BCS THE JANITOR WAS CLEANING IT. So i took a place in line, waiting for the door to open. A man, took place next to me. After some time, the door finally opened! I entered a stall and the man entered the one next to mine. I sat down and peed. I felt something on my leg, i looked down. Liquid was dripping off of the other's stall wall, forming a puddle. Drops splish splashing on my leg. EW EW EWE EW THE MAN WAS PISSING ON THE WALL AND HIS URINE WAS ON ME. STOP STOP STOP. I was so fucking disgusted. Pee y'all, fucking piss. CAN'T YOU FUCKING LEARN HOW TO AIM YOU DUMBASS MOTHERFUCKER!? IF YOU REALLY CAN'T JUST FUCKING SIT DOWN ON THE DAMN TOILET. I moved away from the wall and the puddle as much as I could. Fuck. Even so, his piss was still splish splashing on me. The was my first golden shower i guess? Hahaha. When he finally got out, urine was still dripping off of the wall into the yellow puddle. My feelings were all mixed up, I felt like crying and laughing at the same time. I silently laughed out of uneasiness. This stranger just (accidentally?) peed on me. Well, at least it wasn't in my mouth or something... I got out of the stall in a state of panic. How tf was i supposed to wash piss off of my legs at the beach?? Taking a swim seemed like the most logical option, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with a soap-free option... I also could put soap all over my legs... How tf would i rinse it??? By taking a fucking swim? Yeah, but the beach was like really far away, that meant walking with hand soap all over my legs in front of strangers. I used wet paper towels to wash off as much pee as i could, washed my hands and got out. That's when i saw it! God didn't abandon me! A bottle of hand sanitizer!!!! I put an outrageously big amount of hand sanitizer in my hands and rubbed it all over my legs. Drunk legs, surgery room level sanitized legs. The new cocktail: legs, water, salt, sweat, urine, alcohol. I passed the BBQs, the strangers and the clouds a flies, swallowing some bugs on my way to the tent. Seasoned legs and fresh living protein snacks, that's what i got from the washroom.

# MILULU'S NYC.
I LOVED GOING TO NEW YORK! What a beautiful city. There's a lot of people there, rich ones and poor ones. We saw a lot of things! The Statue Of Liberty, Ground Zero, World Trade Center, Grand Central Terminal...
One of my favorite was Summit One Vanderbilt. It's a huge tower, the highest in New York. We took an elevator that took us like 90 floors high in like 40 seconds. Flashing, mirror covered elevator. Metallic decors, mirror floors, huge windows, silver balloons, art expo... Everything was beautiful, EVEN THE WASHROOM!! There was fog but it was still very beautiful and impressive. We went to so many different places. The amount of people is overwhelming. Umbrellas, flowers and ponchos sellers. We walked a lot, went in various stores! We even went to the UGG store! We also went to the Nike store. SHOES, THERE'S SHOES EVERYWHERE! I walked around. I had to pee, again. So i looked for a washroom. It was located in a creepy hallway.  As i was walking, i saw two men talking. I noticed the washrooms' doors. I didn't know if the men were waiting to go or if they were waiting for someone so I tried to open one of the doors. As soon as I opened the door, I heard a steady rhythm. Breathing. Up, down. I WAS LOOKING AT A STRANGER JERKING OFF. He was facing the wall, aiming for the toilet. His right arm beating the shit out of his meat. He didn't even turn back to look at me. I don't even think that he knew I was there. I closed the door. I walked away pretty fast. The I heard one of the two men say: ""You good bro?"" I was like WHAT THE FUCK? Was he talking to me or to the dude who was jerking off behind the unlocked door???? Like, yo. I loved NYC. Y'ALL SHOULD GO TO NYC!

# MILULU'S FAKE LOVE CONFESSION.

Yeah. The title.

I used to use Discord a lot. A WHOLE FUCKING LOT. I ""knew"" a lot of people. During my downward spiralling, I met a Brasilian boy online. Here's what he told me:
He's around 14
He's Brasilian
He's a boy
He used to send nudes to strangers
He doesn't have a lot of friends irl
... Blah blahhhh

We made a promise: Never send nudes to strangers ever again and never watch shota ever again. In my opinion, that isn't a bad idea... I think that there shouldn't be any children doing disgusting things for adults.

We failed. I told him that I had failed and he told me that he had also failed. He felt so fucking bad. He kept saying that he was a mess. He wanted to kill himslef. He told me that he was drunk and that his parents were away. I tried to calm him down. I was so fucking stressed out. I was trying to save someone's life in the middle of the night. 

Then, one night, during a family party, he texted me to confess his feelings... What the fuck was i supposed to do? I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KILL HIMSELF.... so i told him that i loved him too... I know it's wrong, but like... Idk what would've happened if I told him that he didn't interest me bcs BRO I DON'T FUCKING KNOW YOU, I NEVER EVEN TOUCHED OR SAW YOU. he was happy, but still a bit depressed.

Then he started saying lover typa things. He wanted us to share nudes bcs ""that's the kinda things a couple do"". I refused because we promised to never do that again. I told him to do as he wanted, but that I wouldn't send nudes. He sent a dick pic. I didn't know what to answer. Since I didn't instantly answer, he deleted the picture and started saying that he was so stupid and that I didn't like him... He started to panic and all. I was scared as fuck. Only I knew that he was depressed. Well, actually i still don't know if it was just a lie or if it was true. I don't really want to know.

I don't even remember if I told him ""bye"" when i deleted my account. I don't think i did, but idk.

I just wanted to get rid of everything.

# MILULU'S NON-CON FANTASY.
Once, I went to the beach(?). I was wearing shorts that were a little too short for me. I was picking up pebbles to do ricochets. Then i saw a group of men. I wanted them to look at me, to want me. Every single pebble picking movement was planned. Bend over, arch your back, get back up in a tantalizing way...... I wanted to trap them. I wanted to get trapped by them. But like wtf was I expecting? To be able to turn three men into gay pedophiles? Well, i was trying. Rape me. 
Life isn't a porn film. People don't just randomly fuck eachother for no reason. There's laws. Adults can't fuck kids. Pedophilia is really bad

# MILULU'S DRUNK CALL.
Drink, after drink, after drink. Shots, shots, shots. Cake and chips. Water. Heyyyyyy!!!!
I called my friends while i was drunk. It was fun, but not the next day. You feel so slutty when your drunk. So free. But when you're too drunk, you just feel like shit.

# MILULU'S NEW FRIEND.
I met this Asian girl online. She was pretty nice and normal at first. We were talking about our favorite mangas and other things. At one point, we started talking about our kinks. Her's were shota and guro. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT WEIRD ASS PSYCHOPATIC PEDOPHILIAC MIX????!!! GURL- girl was a pedonecrophile. She made me join a private server with her friends. It was full of gory shota content. Dead  or beat up manga boys in inappropriate positions. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!? At that moment I didn't really care because, she wasn't mean to me, she actually was pretty nice. But now that i think about it, this girl had a serious problem.

# MILULU'S BEDROOM.
there's this atmosphere in a bedroom.
It's reassuring but worrying. It's your space but you're away from everyone. You feel like you should be with everyone else, but you just do nothing. You have to force yourself to get up and leave that comfort. You have to leave your comfort to use your time. You feel like you have to do all these things, but do you really have to? I just wanna be always comfortable. I wanna gain knowledge, skills and experience while being comfortable. But you get nothing if you do nothing. Doing nothing isn't fun. But how am I supposed to be 100% comfortable when I'm not good at something? What's better?

# MILULU'S BRIDGE.
The bridge. One week out of two, I walk home from school. I have to cross that bridge. It's usually windy. Comfortable during summer, cold as fuck during winter. Sometimes, I stop to look at the water under me. Sometimes throwing things in the water. It really beautiful. But it's dirty bcs of pollution. What would it feel like to jump in the water? I don't want to do it i am just wondering. How high, how long, how scary, how cold? I'll never jump off that bridge because, why would I? I'm not depressed, I live a beautiful life.

Fucking mess, talentless mess

# MILULU'S HATRED (random) (extremely abridged sample)


(sorry, WELL ACTUALLY BRUH NAH FUCK OFF, WHY WOULD I HAVE TO BE SORRY, I'M A GODDAMN ARTIST! A VISIONARY! I AM ART!)

I fucking hate school. I don't get how there's people who want to become teachers. A shitty job. You're in school during your youth and you go back to school during your adulthood. What the fuck. Help. Who wants to get mocked by stupid teenagers.

AHWHSHDBFJ I don't.

I hate.
I just hate.
Idk what but i do.
I'm mad at something.
Something's missing.
The missing piece.
There's a hole inside of me. I mean there's many holes outside and inside of me but there's one specific hole that just moves around and changes shape inside of me. I hate it. It's longing ig. Longing for ""something"". Something unknown. I long for success maybe?

HAHAHSHWBSID FBF IF SOMEONE READS THIS THEY'LL BE LIKE: WHAT THE FUCK? I don't get it? 

I can't help you understand i don't even understand it myself.

I'm having fun for real, writing is fun. When you start it's like a waterfall, it's endless.
Thoughts.
