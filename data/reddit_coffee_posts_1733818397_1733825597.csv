I have been friends with this person for 8 years. We see each other only a handful of times a year but are close friends enough to talk about intimate topics. I gave my friend a ride in my car. We went shopping and stopped for a meal and coffee at a couple of points. 

I started to smell whiffs of something unpleasant towards the end of our hangout but wasn‚Äôt sure what it was. After dropping my friend off, I noticed that there was a patch of smeared poo where they had been sitting in my car passenger seat. Clearly that is what I had been smelling earlier in the day. They were wearing a skirt with tights so I hadn‚Äôt seen anything on them at all, even as they walked away from the car. I assume the skirt wasn‚Äôt covering the offending area while they were seated.

 I have paid to have the seat professionally cleaned but I feel like I have to bring this accident up to my friend. They are generally open about intimate things like medical stuff but they have never mentioned any issues with incontinence. I can only assume they must have realised at some point later (at least when they undressed at home??) that they had soiled themselves but they haven‚Äôt brought up anything to me and have still messaged me normal friendly messages. 

In the meantime I feel dreadful for not bringing it up as soon as I realised but I was more focused on getting the car seat cleaned asap and I don‚Äôt want to humiliate my friend. I just don‚Äôt know what to say to them. There is some history of this friend occasionally smelling a bit funky but I always thought it was maybe laundry not being fully clean or dried properly. I don‚Äôt want to be insensitive, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to pay $$$ for upholstery biohazard cleaning if this is likely to happen again!!!

1hayjjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Melodysekkochamber/comments/1hayjjo/good_morning/,Good morning ,"I can‚Äôt sleep. I got like 3.5-4 hours maybe and I took meds. It sucks. I imagine he‚Äôs past the losing sleep part and I‚Äôll be in it for awhile.

I have just a few more things to do until I can rest. I‚Äôm sure when rest time comes I will be very tired and also very sad. Christmas will be rough probably a mixed bag.

I have a few sad songs I like right now and one happy one by public enemy that comes on at the end and makes me feel redeemed like I‚Äôm rising from the ashes. 

I read unsent letters even though I know he‚Äôs not writing there, he‚Äôs past the point where he‚Äôs looking for redemption and on to whatever he‚Äôs onto right now. There are people there that sound like they could be him, but they‚Äôre never him. I posted my poetry to Instagram and Lexi liked it. I told her the first one is about Ilya and not to share it. She said she figured and that they were both excellent. Made me feel nice. There are two typos in that one and the editors changed the formatting. Not great I mean why wouldn‚Äôt you just copy and paste and also when a poet makes formatting choices, you leave them. They‚Äôre for a reason. But it‚Äôs still pretty cool to get published again.

Fuck it‚Äôs five am and I have not slept enough and I can either try to get another hour before I have to wake up L or I can just get to work. I just hate laying in bed in the dark wishing for sleep.

My gratitude list yesterday was incredibly long but I still felt so depressed. Everything is colored by the loss, but everything else is really good. I am trying now to just forget it. Push it out of my head. It could be months before we talk again. He‚Äôs clearly not keen to be friends and doesn‚Äôt miss me all that badly. I wish I could just be terrible and lash out. Holding yourself to such a high standard is annoying. I sometimes wonder if life would be better if I acted like a jerk. But I think they make themselves miserable in the long run. 

The dream about Alex helped me understand like what I tried to do and why it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore what happens. Composing my life narrative and making a collage about it helped me put things in perspective. The next essay won‚Äôt be as fun and mom and dad are home tomorrow. I‚Äôm not ready for the chaos I will probably lock myself in my room to finish it and then sleep for days after.

1hayi7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BicycleShed/comments/1hayi7q/my_experience_and_review_with_the_schwinn_high/,My Experience and review with the Schwinn high timber mountain bike.,"I decided to get into some outdoor adventures and my best buddy suggested I try out the Schwinn high timber mountain bike. After using this thing for a couple of weeks, I thought why not share my experience here.



Unboxing and putting together this Schwinn wasn't a big deal. I‚Äôm not exactly a DIY person, and seriously, my IKEA furniture can vouch for that. But this was different. Surprisingly, the bike was mostly pre-assembled and came with all the tools I needed. Even my younger cousin, who thinks helping means watching YouTube, jumped in to assist. It turned into a cool little bonding moment, despite the occasional ‚Äúare we there yet?‚Äù every five minutes.



First ride felt like freedom, clich√© as it sounds. Took it out on a local trail and man, it was smooth. The front suspension really did its job. It felt like cruising over clouds. I‚Äôm just your average rider, so the sturdy, yet lightweight aluminum frame made me feel like a pro. If you‚Äôre not into aluminum, they got a steel frame option too. But let‚Äôs be real, a lightweight bike was a win for this couch potato heart.

If curious \[[check the price here](https://expertbiking.com/product-reviews/versatile-schwinn-high-timber-review-a-mountain-bike-for-all-ages-and-terrains-b08239tzwy/)\]

Zooming through 21-speeds was pretty seamless. There was a bit of fiddling with the gears in the beginning but thanks to random YouTube tutorials, it was a quick fix. Not a huge deal but something to keep in mind.



I loaned the bike to my sister who fancied a joyride. The adjustable seat had her flying down the street in no time. Watching her pedal away with so much joy was priceless‚Äîand gave me a good excuse to take a coffee break!



The Schwinn high timber has actually spiced up our weekends. Just know it asks for some love in the maintenance area and you'll be golden. Keep a check on those gears!



Pros? Versatile sizing here; with wheel options from 24 to 29 inches, it's friendly for teens and adults alike. Pretty neat that they offer both aluminum and steel frames depending on your gusto. The front suspension really takes the sting out of bumpy trails, and having 7 or 21 speeds means you can choose your flavor of adventure.



Cons, mate? The gears might need fine-tuning fresh outta the box. Wouldn't hurt to have a splash more color options‚Äî'cause we all love choices, right? And don‚Äôt expect it to come packed with fancy accessories, so maybe no water bottle holder or kickstand out of the gate.



All things considered, the Schwinn has been a great companion. Whether hitting rugged trails, sharing it with the fam, or just cruising for some peace of mind, it's got you covered. Just remember, show the bike some maintenance love now and then. A regular clean, lubing the chain, brake checks, and tire inspections should keep it running well. And if you‚Äôre a total newbie like me, shift gears while pedaling gently, it helps big time!



A heads-up about warranty: Schwinn has a limited lifetime warranty on defects. Keep your receipt, and register online‚Äîjust in case. All this bike lingo is fresh to me, but Schwinn‚Äôs support folks seem pretty chill for helping.



Anyway, if you‚Äôre looking to explore some dirt trails or need a fun ride for the family, giddy up! Just don‚Äôt forget to wear a helmet, no one likes a bruised noggin. Cheers.",1,1733825023.0,BicycleShed,0,1.0,False

That‚Äôs what inspired me to dive headfirst into creating an [AI-powered recruitment software](https://hiregen.com) that‚Äôs designed to transform how companies hire.

Here‚Äôs what I learned along the way, and how AI is reshaping recruitment as we know it! üëá

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Recruitment Needed AI

* **Manual screening is outdated**: Recruiters spend **23+ hours per hire** just sifting through resumes. üò±
* **Bias is a big issue**: Unintentional bias often creeps into hiring decisions, limiting diversity.
* **Job seekers demand speed**: Waiting weeks for feedback? No thanks.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ How AI Solves These Pain Points

* **Automated resume screening**: AI analyzes resumes in seconds, matching skills, experience, and culture fit.
* **Bias reduction**: AI focuses on objective data, leveling the playing field for all candidates.
* **Smart matching**: AI connects the right candidates to the right roles, like a matchmaking app for jobs. üíº‚ù§Ô∏è

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cool Features in Modern AI Recruitment Tools

* **Chatbots for instant candidate communication** ü§ñ
* **Predictive analytics for better hiring decisions** üìä
* **Skill assessments powered by machine learning** üß†
* **Integration with job boards and social media platforms** üåê

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges We Faced

* Training the AI to *understand context*. Example: A ""Java expert"" could mean coffee enthusiast or programming pro. ‚òïüë©‚Äçüíª
* Convincing HR teams to trust the tech.
* Balancing speed with candidate experience.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ What the Future Holds

* Imagine AI scheduling interviews, negotiating offers, and onboarding new hires seamlessly.
* Companies can make hiring decisions in **days, not weeks**.
* Job seekers will have personalized career recommendations, tailored to their skills and goals.

# My Question to You:

What‚Äôs your biggest pain point with recruitment or job hunting? ü§î

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, or even skepticism about AI in recruitment. Let‚Äôs start a conversation!

1hay9ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hay9ln/autistic_struggles_to_understanding_and/,Autistic struggles to understanding and recognizing abuse,"I recently found a video which was talking about the challenges autistic people face to understand and recognize abusive behaviors. And it helped me unpack some of the very confusing behaviors people did and clearly see patters in it. I think it as a really good resource.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0UAPVSi8r4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0UAPVSi8r4)

One of the most baffling things for me to realize was the hidden expectations people had for me in the past. They were never communicated in a straight forward way (I expect you do make me coffee in the morning or I expect you to to make me happy all the time, etc), other people just unleashed their emotions onto me instead when I did not fulfill these expectations. Which in turn made me into a people pleaser.  
Any conversation where I tried to come up with a solution or a compromise for this situation was getting so out of hand. It felt genuinely easier to just learn the expectations of other people and fulfill them

Now I realize that I can say no to things without there being a consequence. People who love you respect your boundaries and don't try to manipulate you into things with their emotions. They don't expect you to make them feel better about themselves. They don't expect you to respond with a phrase back to them or expect you to compliment them when they complimented you. They take care of their own feelings and actions and don't see you as an tool which they can use to feel better.

Reading about abuse while I experienced it was frustrating because I recognized the signs. But when I tried to address it people had such a wild reactions to emotionally exhausting me or convince me that I don't know what I was taking about or tried to convince me I am the abuser.

Now that I finally in a relationship where I just can say no without there being an argument of ""But why..."" or ""I though you liked..."" or having emotional outburst I could recognize the difference. And it is so fucking refreshing to have this autonomy over your own life. When something triggers me I am not forced to talk about it because of a stupid reason the other person just came up. I decide when I tell people things and when not. I decide when I wanna do something good for people without them expecting me to do it.

I wanna finally stick up for myself and not let other people confuse me with their emotional reactions or hidden expectations or start arguing with me for the dumbest shit I apparently did or refuse to do. And I am getting better and better with that every day.

I load with max 250g raw beans Honestly thinking of bringing it down to 200g and check for differences. Sadly still waiting for the good and easy upgrade (Aillio for the moment is too much in every sense and didn't pull the trigger).

It's basically everything about getting better roasts, I want to reach more fruity notes and have smells that last much longer - somehow my coffee doesn't get that and I am not sure what is the problem. Even with one way valve, the smell goes away after a few days, while some professional roasts (that I had in the past, normally gifts from other countries) last so much longer with very concrete notes.

I am also recording roasting curves (manually, since the machine is completely analog) and keeping those records for reference.

In any case, a next benchmark I had in mind was to possibly get ""proved"" good beans, even better if I can get the same beans roasted professionally + raw beans, and see how my roast compares to the professionally roasted sample, using the same raw beans. Or even just raw beans that are for sure of good quality so that if my coffee comes up the same as always, I know it's my roasting and not the source bean.

I don't believe I have objectively bad quality raw beans and my roasting process doesn't really have concrete flaws either.

It's just a matter of detail...I want to be able to get those (sometimes very present) notes of marzipan, nectarine, vanilla etc. when I open my roasted beans, and not the usual ""good coffee with some other notes"" that I have been getting till now. I already tried experimenting with other development times, trying to play a bit more with air around 1st crack, still not the results I am after.",1,1733823545.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

Another guy introduces himself and asks my name. I tell him to guess, the most Russian name. He says Natalia. Im like ok, who told you all this info? He says he just watched ""Black Widow"". Riight.
One guy left, guy with a puppy stayed. Started asking me various grammatical questions and asking to teach him Russian. I tell him sorry, theres Duolingo and Rosetta stone for that. He asks to go out for coffee, as friends, so I could teach him. Nope,sorry, married and not interested in friends. He proceeds to talk to me for a while.

He then extends his reservation for another night. Comes up with some chick, looked like he hired to pretend to be his gf. Starts talking to me again. I was playing pool in the lobby, so he asked to join me. Whatevs. Extends his res again! Third night he didnt even come to the desk at all.

What happens when your listing images fail to meet the quality of standards required by Amazon?¬†

Although Amazon will not directly ‚Äúpenalize‚Äù you, poor-quality photos can severely affect your visibility, sales, and overall success. Poor-image listings potentially lead to suppressed listings, lower rankings, and a collapse in customer trust.

¬†In this blog, we‚Äôre going to find out how low-quality listing images are impacting your listings, why image quality is important to Amazon‚Äôs algorithm, and what you can do to ensure your photos are not holding you back. Ready to transform your listings and take control of sales? Let‚Äôs start!

# General Impacts of Low-Quality Listing Images

Bad¬†**listing images**¬†can cost you more than just customer attention; they can also cause you to have fewer clicks, lower sales, and a damaged brand name. Here‚Äôs how these listing images affect your success in two ways:

# Lower Click-Through Rates

¬†Amazon results are highly graphical. If your product pictures do not appear as appealing as others, the buyers will be less likely to click your listing. The less clicks happen, the lesser pieces of traffic and lost sales occur.

# Low Conversion Rates

Even after clicking or opening a listing, poor pictures are incapable of building trust and are unable to represent the value of the product that leads to low¬†[conversion rates](http://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/improve-ecommerce-conversion-rates-with-these-6-seo-tips.html).

* A seller selling good-quality leather wallets used poorly lit photos that do not showcase the product‚Äôs texture or details. The seller was competitive with prices, but its CTR only stood at 1.5%, far below the category average of 4%. After hiring a professional photographer and using clear, detailed listing images, they saw CTR soar to 5.2%, bringing about a 40% hike in sales.
* A kitchenware seller had this product: a bamboo cutting board. Those listing images were really poorly done and too dark with lots of grain. Customers constantly said that it looked different in person, so there was a 20% return rate, and poor customer feedback. The seller revised it with bright, high-resolution pictures showing how grainy it was and how thick it was. Not only did the number of returns go down, but sales increased by 30% within one month.

# Why Image Quality Matters for Amazon Success

The way it‚Äôs sold on Amazon means customers cannot touch or inspect the product. They rely heavily on listing images for product quality, features, and value. Good¬†**listing images**¬†create an excellent perception and confidence in the buyer, whereas poor listing images will raise questions.

* One sneaker seller was using highly polished, high-resolution listing images showing various angles, zoomed-in details, and on-model shots. This professional approach helped it gain a competitive edge and increased its sales by about 30%.
* A pet bed salesperson noticed that a quality product was returning very few sales. His original photos did not have good resolution or detail. He spent money on a photography shoot and highlighted the material, size, and how soft it is. Buyers responded enthusiastically. In just two months, he increased his sales by 50%.

# The Role of Product Listing Images in the Amazon Algorithm

[Amazon‚Äôs A9 favors listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-optimize-amazon-listing-with-chatgpt/)¬†that will actually meet the customer‚Äôs expectations. The listing images of a listing make up a big part of that; thus, high-quality listing images will improve CTR and conversions but also signal to¬†[Amazon that it is an optimized](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-optimize-amazon-ad-campaign/)¬†listing for customer satisfaction.

* A brand uploaded extremely clear and bright listing images that met at least all of Amazon‚Äôs standards for listing images. The listing images showed the product in action. There was additional customer benefit to that. Ranking on the first page of Amazon for various keywords.
* A home decor merchant began uploading listing images overlaid with text and logos, violating Amazon‚Äôs policies. They found that their listing became suppressed; thus traffic started to decline. When they uploaded compliant listing images with clear white backgrounds and high resolutions, their listing recovered, and traffic increased by 25%.

# Can It Result In Reduced Sales?

Short answer: yes. Consumers view these blurry or indistinct¬†**listing images**¬†as a description of lower-quality merchandise. The less they are likely to trust that listing, therefore it would be¬†[selling fewer products](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/selling-products-on-amazon-successfully/)¬†and perhaps more bounces.

* An electronics seller added low-resolution, poorly cut listing images of wireless earbuds. Positive reviews notwithstanding, the bounce rate of the listing was 20%, far from average. Replacing the pictures with professional-grade brought the bounce rate down to 8% and doubled sales in a week.‚Äù
* A clothing brand launched a new collection shooting to blur the listing images out of focus. Customers complained there were unclear details and inaccurate colors. Sales were miserable until they added professionally shot lifestyle photos. But two weeks later, sales increased by 60 percent.

# Understanding Amazon‚Äôs Image Standards

Guidelines for¬†**listing images**¬†on Amazon: Strict requirements that fit with what a customer would expect include:

* A minimum resolution of 1000 pixels on the longest side.
* Pure white backgrounds for main listing images.
* Clear, high-definition listing images, free from watermarks, logos, or overlays of text.
* Failure to meet up with these standards may attract suppression in listings.
* Example 1: A gadget seller had not met the requirement of a white background for listing images and had uploaded lifestyle listing images as the main photo. The listing was suppressed, and sales stopped. When corrected, the listing came live, and sales resumed, which rose by 15%.
* Example 2: A furniture seller was seen using low-resolution photographs for their products. This not only countered Amazon‚Äôs guidelines but also made the listing images unattractive. After they upgraded to high-resolution listing images which were in line with the standards, they witnessed a 20% increase in traffic.

# Does Amazon Punish Sellers for Bad Photos?

Amazon is not outright to sanction you, but failing its standards will indirectly lead to suppression of listings, lesser visibility, and poor performance metrics in the checkout.

* Example 1: One of the listing images on an offer for sale, that of a toy seller, was colored, something Amazon doesn‚Äôt allow. The posting was stopped and flagged until compliant listing images were added. Sales go down and rankings also during the period of downtime.
* Example 2: This outdoor gear retailer used deceptive listing images which flattered the size of their tents. Dismal reviews occurred as a consequence of customer complaints about deceptive visuals, thereby influencing the product rating and sales.

# Why Pixelated Listing Images Will Ruin Your Product Ranking

Pixelated and blurry¬†**listing images**¬†have a poor customer experience, reducing both CTR and engagement. This informs the Amazon algorithm that your listing is not satisfying the needs of any customers, and it might start to rank lower in search results.

* Example 1: The vendor selling skincare put up low-resolution listing images, without even showing the¬†[product‚Äôs packaging](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-attractive-product-packaging-improves-amazon-fba-reviews/)¬†or texture. Customer interest was poor and the listing fell from page 1 to page 4 in search engine results. Updating high-resolution photos helped recover their rankings and boost¬†[Amazon sales](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/the-secret-to-higher-amazon-sales-labeling-your-main-image/).
* Example 2: A phone case seller used low-resolution listing images, reasoning that photography costs didn‚Äôt matter because it was that cheap. Organic traffic dropped by 15% in a month. After hiring professional listing images, the traffic and sales recovered, which proved that high-quality visuals paid for themselves.¬†

Relationship of visual quality to buyer confidence Clear, professional¬†[listing images equate to product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-supercharge-amazon-ctr-for-your-unique-product-listings/)¬†quality and reliability for buyers, while lousy visuals dilute such trust and drive buyers toward competitors.¬†

* Example 1: A jewelry seller featured sharp, detailed close-ups of gemstones, highlighting their quality and craftsmanship. This reduced return rates by 50% and increased positive reviews.¬†
* Example 2: A sporting goods brand captured an image showing how long its product lasted through action shots and received appreciation from customers, whose feedback score increased by 60%.¬†

# How Poor Listing Images Leave Bad Pictures About Customers

¬†Low-quality¬†**listing images**¬†usually mislead people on the product‚Äôs appearance, functionality, or quality; they end up returning the product or even hating the seller.¬†

* Example 1: Dark, blurry photos of new jackets for an apparel brand failed to create the right impression. Customers returned orders because the colors were not as expected‚Äîimproved listing images taken with proper lighting reduced returns by 35%.¬†
* Example 2: A home appliance seller faced backlash for unclear listing images of product dimensions. Customers felt misled, leaving critical reviews. New, detailed listing images clarified dimensions and features, improving the product rating by 20%.

# What are Amazon‚Äôs Image Requirements for Sellers?

Amazon‚Äôs image guidelines are meant to create a professional and consistent shopping experience. These rules help customers make smart buying choices by making sure listing images are clear, high-quality, and focused on the product. Here are the¬†[main image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/is-it-time-to-up-your-amazmain-image-strategyon/)¬†requirements for sellers:

* Image File Formats Only JPEG, PNG, TIFF, or GIF formats are acceptable.
* Resolution:¬†[Amazon images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-turn-shoppers-into-buyers-with-killer-amazon-images/)¬†should be at least 1000 pixels in dimension on the longest side so zooming can work.
* Focus and Clarity: Pictures need to be clear with good lighting so the colors come out right.
* Frame Fill: The product should take up at least 85% of the image frame.
* Main Image Description:
* The main image should have a clean white background (RGB 255, 255, 255).
* No other text, logos, watermarks, or listing images are allowed.
* The product should be alone, without other extra items, boxes, or distracting things.
* Example 1: A seller for kitchenware used listing images of the frying pan with a lot of background detail. The listing was not allowed to stay posted, and then, after uploading an image of the frying pan in clear detail with a plain white background, the listing was reinstated and sales shot up 15%.
* Example 2: An apparel company published low-quality listing images of T-shirts. Amazon marked them as of low quality. The seller resubmitted a clearer image with better lighting and focus; with that, he sensed an uptick in CTR and a boost in sales by 20%.

# Knowing Amazon Product Image Rules

Clearly, Amazon has really strict image rules that encompass every detail regarding how a product should look in pictures. Alright, let‚Äôs get into it:

# Frame Requirements Image

The product ought to take up most of the frame, covering at least 85% of the image. This enables customers to see a clear image of the product without any breaks.

# Background Rules:

Level listing images should have a neutral white background in RGB 255, 255, 255. Lifestyle listing images or photos with colors or texture background are allowed only for secondary listing images.

# Realistic Portrayal:

Listing images should show what the product looks like, exactly and literally, without exaggeration or misleading listing images. The color, dimensions, and features shown should be the same as the actual product.

* Example 1: For example, a seller of handheld vacuum cleaners posted several photos with busy backgrounds and other household items around. After taking new photos of the¬†[product on a plain white background](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/product-photography-on-a-white-background/), the click-through rate for their listings doubled.
* Example 2: A cosmetics¬†[brand used filters to make product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/sell-branded-products-on-amazon/)¬†colors look better. Customers said there were differences between the pictures and the real product. The seller changed their photos to show the real colors, which led to better reviews and fewer returns.

# Does Amazon reject listings for non-compliant photos?

Yes, Amazon would consider enforcing their strict image guidelines. All listings can have suppressed or rejected photos- which may prevent them from appearing in search results until they are corrected-that subsequently can cause downtime and missed sales.

* Example 1: A toy seller for kids added promotional words on their main pictures, such as ‚Äú50% Off‚Äù and ‚ÄúFree Shipping.‚Äù Amazon marked the listing for breaking the rule about adding text on listing images. When it was fixed with proper listing images, the listing was again visible, and¬†[sales improved](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-private-label-service/).
* Example 2: The home d√©cor brand posted listing images of curtains that were wrongly sized, hence the stretched look. The¬†[listing of the product was withdrawn by Amazon](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/9435-2/). The seller had to replace the listing images so that the product could again be listed.

# Technical Details for Amazon Listing images

Amazon‚Äôs technical rules make sure that listing images look right on different devices and meet what customers expect. The main requirements are:

* Resolution: Listing images should be at a resolution of 1000 pixels on the longest side to utilize zoom on Amazon, which is a very important sales-enhancing feature.
* Aspect Ratio: Listing images must be square which would have a 1: 1 format, cropped or otherwise these must fit the product well.
* File Size: The maximum file size is 10 MB for a seamless download on all platforms.
* Color Mode: RGB or CMYK color modes shall display the product correctly.
* Example 1: An electronics seller posted pictures that were smaller than the 1000-pixel minimum size. Shoppers could not zoom in to see product details, which caused less interest. After they switched to high-resolution photos, sales went up by 25%.
* Example 2: A furniture brand uploaded CMYK listing images, yet the same had no satisfactory colors on Amazon. Using RGB enhanced it and made its customers happier.

# Do Your Listing Images Support Amazon‚Äôs General Policies?

Not following Amazon‚Äôs image rules can hurt your sales. Good¬†**listing images**¬†help buyers trust you, boost your ranking, and stop your listings from being hidden.

* Example 1: The gadget seller posted some pix of messy background and poor lighting. A sense of not being professional emanated from the brand. After improving the pictures and proper lighting, the sales of the seller improved by 40%.
* Example 2: A jewelry brand didn‚Äôt provide zoomable listing images, which frustrated customers trying to view intricate details. After uploading photos that met Amazon‚Äôs resolution requirements, the listing received more positive reviews and fewer returns.

# Image Specifications for Amazon: Backgrounds and Resolutions

The background and resolution of your listing images also can highly influence the performance of your listing. Your main listing images must have a pure white background, and these listing images must have at least 1000 pixels in resolution.¬†

* Example 1: A clothing brand failed to have the white background requirement and used the textured backdrops. Amazon suppressed the listings until the seller provided compliant listing images, which delayed their launch by one week.
* Example 2: An outdoor equipment seller posted low-quality listing images that looked blurry. Customers were unhappy with the bad visual quality, which caused sales to drop. High-quality replacements made customers feel confident again and increased sales.¬†

# Grasp Amazon‚Äôs Primary Image Rules¬†

The most important¬†[image in your catalog is the main](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/design-matters-a-b-test-uncovers-the-winning-main-image-formula-for-amazon-sales-and-conversions/)¬†image. This is the one which will always appear in search results and be the first thing customers see.¬†[Amazon has very strict rules for main listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/10-things-you-should-not-be-doing-in-amazon-listing-optimization/)¬†images: Place a clean white background underneath the product.¬†

Any packaging, props, or signage on the screen is not allowed extra. The product should be clearly visible, filling at least 85% of the frame.¬†

* Example 1: A seller of shoes posted a primary image with props and decoration.¬†[Amazon rejected the listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-drive-external-traffic-to-your-amazon-listing/), and the seller was asked to change the image as it violated the rules.¬†
* Example 2: A tech gadget brand showed pictures of the product in its packaging. Customers could not see the actual product, which led to low engagement. Changing to a clear image on a white background improved visibility and¬†[click-through rates.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/demand-curve-7-ad-types-that-increase-click-through-rates/)

# Penalties for Low-Quality Listing Images

# How Does Amazon Sanction Listings with Bad Photos?

Amazon identifies non-compliant listings through advanced algorithms and manual reviews. It then penalizes poor or non-compliant listing images to maintain a consistent shopping experience. Penalties for violations of image requirements include:

Listing Suppression: The search result list excludes those listings that violate the image requirement. The listings are not shown in search unless the issues with the listing images are rectified.

Reduced Ranking: Listings with poorly qualified listing images are less likely to be viewed, thereby reducing sales opportunities.

Account Health Impact: Violations can deteriorate your account‚Äôs performance metrics, leading to potential account suspension.

# How Does Amazon Penalize Listings with Poor Photos?

# How Does Amazon Penalize Listings With Poor Photos?

Amazon employs advanced algorithms partnered with human reviews for identifying non-compliant listings. In case substandard or non-compliant¬†**listing images**¬†

are detected, then Amazon imposes penalties for uniform experience in shopping. Penalties on violation of listing images comprise:

* Listing Suppression: Non-compliant listings are removed from the search results until the image problems have been resolved.
* Lower Ranking Low-resolution listing images lose rankings low on search visibility lists greatly reduce listings-visibility and sales-volume.

Account health is greatly affected by frequent violations, which can diminish your performance metrics and potentially result in account suspension.

* Example 1: A home goods seller posted pixelated listing images of their cushions. Amazon shut down listings because of low resolution. Upon exchanging the low-quality listing images for great quality ones, listings were restored, and sales returned to normal.
* Example 2: A clothing retailer used lifestyle listing images for all of its primary listing images, thus inadvertently violating Amazon‚Äôs requirement for a white background. With their¬†[Amazon listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/product-photography-for-amazon-listings-exploring-flatlays-to-360-degree-shots/)¬†flagged, Amazon suppressed them for two weeks until compliant photos were finally uploaded.

# The Impact Of Using Low Resolution Listing images On Amazon

Low-resolution listing images can frustrate buyers who rely on Amazon‚Äôs zoom feature to examine product details. Without clear visuals, customers may avoid your product or leave¬†[negative feedback](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-remove-negative-feedback-on-amazon/), impacting your overall performance.

**Consequences:**

* Lower Click-Through Rates (CTR): Poor- pictures make your listings less attractive, thus fewer clicks.
* Lower Conversion Rates: Customers are unlikely to buy if they cannot see the product.
* Misleading listing images can bring about frustration to the consumers and raise return orders.
* Example 1: The electronics vendor used pictures at lower than 1000 pixels. The buyers were not able to enlarge the product details. Not as clear, the conversion was reduced by 20 %. After they uploaded 1000-pixel pictures, the conversion recovered very strongly.
* Example 2: A beauty brand used dark, blurry photos of skincare products. Buyers struggled to identify key features and chose competitors‚Äô listings instead. After investing in professional photography, the brand saw a 30% sales increase.

# Do Bad Listing Images Affect Your Buy Box Program?

Therefore, the Buy Box is the very coveted area of an Amazon product page, which greatly impacts the sales level.¬†

Winning the¬†[Buy Box](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/making-the-most-of-amazons-buy-box-algorithm/)¬†relies on several factors: competitive price, fulfillment method, and health of your account. However, such low-quality¬†**listing images**¬†will indirectly affect your eligibility by causing a low click-through rate and overall sales performance.

* Example 1: A small electronics retailer, which lost the Buy Box to faster-selling competitors with better listing images, gained the Buy Box for listings after improving the quality of their listing images and adding close-up product shots.
* Example 2: A pet supplies brand with excellent reviews and competitive pricing missed the Buy Box because their main¬†[listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/stolen-listing-images-amazon-2022/)¬†didn‚Äôt meet Amazon‚Äôs guidelines for clarity and resolution. Updating their visuals helped them secure the Buy Box, boosting their sales by 25%.

# Why Amazon Hides Listings with Inferior Listing images

Amazon suppressed listings that do not adhere to its image guidelines, a measure taken to uphold the platform‚Äôs credibility and guarantee a positive experience for customers. These suppressed listings become practically invisible in search results, rendering them unsellable until rectified.

Common Reasons for Overriding:

* Listing images embedded with text overlays, logos, or watermarks.
* All non-compliant main listing images without pure white background.
* Low-resolution or pixelated listing images.
* Example 1: A toy seller used promotional text on their main listing images, like ‚ÄúFree Shipping.‚Äù Amazon flagged the listings for non-compliance and suppressed them until the seller replaced the listing images.
* Example 2: It did not conform to Amazon‚Äôs resolution requirements, uploading blurry photos. After losing visibility, they hired a professional photographer; once the listings were restored, sales increased by 40%.

# Declining Clarity: The Price of Ignoring Image Quality

Amazon‚Äôs search algorithm prioritizes listings with high-quality listing images. Poor-quality visuals harm your SEO performance, leading to lower visibility in search results and reduced traffic.

* Example 1: An furniture seller had ignored the pure white background requirement of Amazon and carried out their pictures using textured backdrops. Their listings ranked lower in search results, resulting in a 25% loss of impressions. After updating their photos, impressions and sales recovered weeks afterwards.
* Example 2: An apparel retailer uploaded photos that did not meet Amazon‚Äôs framing fill requirements (the product occupying at least 85% of the image). The listings suffered de-prioritization, and their competitors who had used compliant visuals outcompeted them.

# Can Bad Photographs Suspend An Account?

Suspension for low-quality listing images is uncommon, although repeated violations or failure to heed warnings can lead to this result. Amazon‚Äôs marketplace places a premium on consistency and professionalism, so violations are taken seriously.

* Example 1: A seller of tech accessories persistently overlooked Amazon‚Äôs warnings concerning the use of text overlays in their listing images. Following several suppressions, their account faced a temporary suspension. To regain access, they were required to submit a comprehensive plan of action.
* Example 2: A home decor brand posted deceptive listing images that oversized its products. After customer complaints and receiving a warning from Amazon, the account was suspended until each of the listings had been updated to post true photos.

# How Image Problems Affect your Amazon Sales Metrics

Low-quality listing images negatively affect key selling metrics, such as CTR, conversion rate, and customer satisfaction. These metrics directly affect your account health and overall visibility on Amazon.

# Mostly affected metrics

CTR: Poor listing images discourage clicks, which drives down traffic to your listings.

Conversion Rate: If the buyers cannot view the product clearly, then they would not buy it.

Customer Satisfaction: Misleading graphics lead to bad reviews and, finally, high returns.

* Example 1: A fashion retailer used outdated, low-resolution listing images that didn‚Äôt reflect the product‚Äôs current design. Negative reviews about misleading photos harmed their performance metrics. Updated visuals led to improved reviews and a 50% increase in sales.
* Example 2: A seller of gadgets suffered from low customer trust and participation as their product listing images were blurred. In turn, improvement in professional listing images highly contributed to the customer‚Äôs CTR and conversion rates.

# Do poor listing images prevent potential customers?

In the highly competitive¬†[Amazon marketplace](https://medium.com/@amazingdeals995/amazon-marketplace-guide-to-opportunities-and-challenges-a4a7596638d5), first impressions count. Your¬†**listing images**¬†are probably going to be the first interaction your customers have with your product. Low-quality listing images can drive people away and send them shopping elsewhere with higher-quality listing images.¬†

* Example 1: The fitness equipment brand failed to display products clearly, and the buyer chose a competitor for high-quality lifestyle listing images. Improved visuals led to a sales rise of 35%. CASE 2: A luxury handbag seller used poorly lit listing images that didn‚Äôt reflect the product‚Äôs true color or quality.¬†

After receiving customer complaints and returns, they invested in professional photography, restoring buyer trust and sales. High standards for image quality at Amazon Amazon upholds image guidelines to preserve the high standards that define its platform.¬†

Any violations incur immediate penalties, safeguarding the customer experience from non-compliant listings.¬†

* Example 1: A skin care brand was banned multiple times due to not using a clean, white background on the highlighted listing images. They made corrections and listings were reinstated; sales increased.¬†
* Example 2: Technologies watermarked all their listing images, and listings were suppressed. Once the image gets removed, the listings are able to get visible and regain lost sales.¬†

# Why Listing Suppression Occurs Due to Image Violations¬†

Listing suppression is the mechanism Amazon uses to make sellers toe its line. Once the listings have been suppressed, they disappear from search results and become utterly invisible until corrected.¬†

* Example 1: Source¬†**listing images**¬†by a toy company were lifestyle listing images that did not comply, and Amazon responded by suppressing listings until white-background listing images were supplied.
* Example 2: A furniture seller uploaded low-resolution listing images that could not support zoom functionality. The result was suppression with sales halted until new listing images were supplied.

# Sales and Conversion Impacts

# Do Bad Listing Images Lower the Click-Through Rate?

Click-through rate, or CTR, is the percentage of those who view your product in search results and click on it. A high CTR is critical because it sends visitors to your listing to convert. However, bad listing images repel buyers and drive them to competitors selling something more attractive.

# Why Poor Listing Images Lower CTR

Poor Product Features: Poorly focused pictures or vague listing images show little and will make customers think twice about clicking on it.

Lousy Looks: Poor graphics mirror very bad quality or even a scam.

No eye-catching look: Buyers don‚Äôt feel like looking at those listings that do not have a flattering appearance.

* Example 1: A kitchen appliance merchant was uploading pixelated listing images of a blender, so details like the various speeds on the machine were difficult to see. Those competitors had clearer, high-resolution listing images that popped up more in search results, resulting in a 50% decrease in CTR.
* Example 2: CTR was much lower than a competitor displaying essentially the same items, but with bright, vivid listing images.

Lesson:

Quality listing photos are magnets in search results; they attract customers to look deeper into your product.

# The Connection Between Image Quality and Conversions

When prospects click on your listing, it is time to sell them something. High-quality listing images help to convince buyers of the features, benefits, and worth of your product.

# How Quality Listing images Boost Conversions

Zoom: A shopping preference is that buyers like to zoom on high-resolution listing images to check for minute details.

Angles: The same product from different sides assists customers in taking a decision.

Lifestyle: Product listing images that show them in real-life scenarios make them more attractive.

* Example 1: An outdoor gear brand used clear, high-resolution listing images of their tent, including zoomable details of the stitching and material. This transparency boosted customer trust, leading to a 30% increase in conversions.
* Example 2: A jewelry seller put a necklace alongside lifestyle photos showing the same necklace on different occasions. This helped the customers to feel better about quality and use, subsequently increasing conversion.

Takeaway:

High-quality listing images aren‚Äôt just aesthetically great; they‚Äôre also informational, by answering any buyer concerns and driving conversions.

# How Low-Quality Photos Impede Customer Decision-Making

Consumers rely on the listing images of a product as a means of making quick decisions. Without the feel of the product, good visual quality becomes an acceptable proxy for credibility. Poor-quality listing images sow seeds of doubt, driving away customers from making a purchase.

Impact on Decisions:

Uncertainty: Slightly blurred or incomplete visual¬†**listing images**¬†make it difficult for a buyer to evaluate the product.

Skepticism: Such a picture may raise doubts about product genuineness or quality.

Negative Bias: Most consumers relate crummy listing images to bad service and low-quality products.

* Example 1: A home furnishings retailer showed blurry pictures of a table lamp, giving the customer no idea how big or finished the article was. Customers ignored the listing due to competition that had very clear, high-quality pictures.
* Example 2: A tech accessories retailer recently uploaded some listing images that did not in any way represent the color and design of the product. This led to negative reviews and an explosion of returns from dissatisfied buyers.

Takeaway

Clear, high-quality listing images reduce friction in decision-making and instill confidence in your product.

# Why High-Quality Listing Images Drive More Sales on Amazon

Amazon‚Äôs algorithm likes listings with good quality listing images as it adds up to a better customer experience. Listings with better¬†**listing images**¬†are more likely to rank high, get more clicks, and ultimately generate good sales.

# Sales Boosting Factors

More Visibility: Listings with professional listing images have better ranking in your search queries.

Better Buyer Engagement: The buyer will longer stay on your page with attractive visuals. Thus, the chance of sale is higher.

Better Return Rate: Error-free visuals minimize the possibility of returning products post-sales.¬†

* Example 1: A sporting goods retailer used professional photography for their yoga mats. The detailing texture and colors of the photographs led to a 40% increase in sales within the first month.
* Example 2: A skincare company featured high-quality before-and-after¬†**listing images**¬†of their product‚Äôs effects. The trust that it depicted translated into increased repeat customers.

Takeaway:

Investment in a high-quality listing image is in and out, meaning directly translated to performing better at sales.

# The Psychology of Product Listing images in E-Commerce

Visuals evoke emotion, leading to a tremendous sway in a person‚Äôs buying decision. Great pictures create desire and assurance to take the eventual action.

# Psychological Triggers

Desirability: Well-styled¬†[product listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/from-click-to-cart-how-to-optimize-your-amazon-product-listings-for-sales/)¬†make people want it.

Trust: High-quality product visuals ensure professionalism and quality products.

Engagement: Vibrant product visuals keep the shopper interested and focused on the product.

* Example 1: A high-end watch retailer utilized highly detailed listing images showcasing the intricate detail that went into the craftsmanship of their items. Shoppers were willing to spend top dollar because the¬†**listing images**¬†conveyed value.
* Example 2: An animal supplies retailer showed lifestyle pictures of contented animals enjoying a product from them. The emotional connections caused more buyers to engage with the shopping page, which then increased sales to 25%.

Takeaway

Use psychology-driven visuals to evoke an emotional response from shoppers and push sales.

# Unsweet Photos Create Reviewing Complaints

Bad reviews are usually due to unmet expectations where most are caused by low-resolution or misleading graphics. Most customers get frustrated and post negative comments or wish to return their products when they feel deceived.

# Why Bad Listing images Causes Complaints

Misrepresentation: Unideal graphics usually don‚Äôt accurately mirror the size, color, or texture of the product.

Lack of Information: Incomplete or vague listing images don‚Äôt give customers enough information about anything.

Disappointment: Products that lack the visual expectation create disappointment.

* Example 1: A furniture brand used an image with exaggerated size of a coffee table. Customer complaints through reviews hampered the branding.
* Example 2: An iPhone case seller uploaded very dark and unclear photos, so buyers received confusing answers about the compatibility with certain mobile device models. The negative reviews affected overall ratings.

Takeaway:

**Listing images**¬†that meet expectations, set up proper expectations, reducing negative feedback.

# Role of Visual Appeal to Raise Amazon Conversions

Visual appeal is directly proportional to a customer‚Äôs desire to buy. Good, high professional-looking pictures create the impression of credibility and highlight the product value.

# Visual Appealing Strategies

Bright Lighting: Products will appear clean and professional.

Consistent Style: Standardizes style and creates a uniform brand image throughout all listings.

Lifestyle Integration: Illustrates the product, and the potential buyer can imagine it in use.

* Example 1: A sportswear brand used action photos of athletes wearing their clothing. The familiar and inspirational imagery had a conversion rate increase of 30%.
* Example 2: A cookware vendor featured food cooked in their pans. There was more likely to be a purchase completed by the buyer after viewing their product‚Äôs functionality in application.

Takeaway:

Quality¬†**listing images**¬†make your brand more attractive while making your products more appealing.

# Impact of Image Quality on Amazon Mobile Buyers

With over 70% of Amazon shoppers browsing on mobile devices, high-quality¬†**listing images**¬†optimized for small screens are essential. Mobile shoppers rely even more on¬†[product visuals](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/harnessing-ai-for-stunning-product-visuals-enhancing-your-amazon-listings/)¬†to make purchase decisions, as descriptions and other details are less prominent on smaller displays.

# Why It Matters

Zoomable Listing images: High-resolution photos allow buyers to inspect products closely.

Clarity: Clear visuals are critical for mobile viewing where screen space is limited.

Speed: Optimized¬†**listing images**¬†load faster, preventing drop-offs.

* The seller optimized listing images on mobile for clarity and zoom functionality. The mobile conversion rate increased by 20%.
* Multiple, high-quality listing images that loaded quickly on mobile were used. Mobile shoppers got a better view of the product, thus enjoying higher sales.

Serve those mobile shoppers with clear, high-quality, and quick-load listing images.

# Do Your Photos Encourage Add-to-Cart Actions?

The best final purpose of a great product listing is to encourage buyers to add the item to the cart. High-quality¬†**listing images**¬†can provide increased confidence, which of course can prompt this action.

# How Listing images Drive Add-to-Cart

* Detail Showcase: The buyer wants to see every aspect of it.
* Emotionally Resonant: Lifestyle photos make products more relatable and desirable.
* Professionalism: Clean, high-quality visuals communicate trustworthiness.

* Example 1: A technology gadget brand used¬†**listing images**¬†showing the product in different environments (home, office, travel). That kept on emphasizing its versatility, driving the Add-to-Cart rate up.
* Example 2: Shoe retailers use high-resolution close-up listing images of stitching and materials and sole patterns for their shoes. Those details would encourage buyers to move forward.

# Tips for Improving Amazon Listing images

The quality of your¬†**listing images**¬†on Amazon has a direct impact on how customers perceive your products, and ultimately how your listings will sell and generate customer interactions.¬†

Small improvements in your product listing images can make a big difference in your sales conversion and customer satisfaction, so check out these simple yet effective ways to update your listing images.

# Use a Plain White Background

The requirements for the background of your¬†**listing images**¬†are pretty specific; the most important one being a pure white background (RGB 255, 255, 255). For the main image of your product listing this is a standard requirement.¬†

I (22nb) have been with my partner (24M) for almost two years now, and he started an apprenticeship a few months ago, he is now onto pigskin and is getting fast tracked, which is making him stressed.

for some context as well, I am a very good cook, and food is how i show those dearest to me how fond I am of them, the thing is I struggle with meal planning for your day to day, and I was thinking maybe he'd appreciate having packed lunches so he wouldn't have to worry about food or feel overwhelmed with money whilst he isn't earning income.

He is just so talented and I know he will go so far in an industry thats so oversaturated with the same flash and art everywhere- hes just incredible and I want to make things easier for him, the cost of living crisis and being so busy has him overwhelmed, as well as trying his hardest for his life passion, i dont want him to burn out.

So i was just hoping for some Advice on what a good packed lunch for someone would consist of, if I should leave some notes for him and cash to buy a coffee? I make him coffee and breakfast in the morning because I want to help him be ready for his day!

Also maybe some suggestions for things to do around the house to take the mental load off? He rents with housemates who I adore, we are all just very neurodivergent so some tasks are definitely out of sight out of mind, and I just was hoping someone with experience could give me some pointers?

Hes just so special to me, i want to be the best partner i can be without him having to take that mental load.

I have asked and he wont take rent money from me or bills, I buy our groceries so it'll be easy to sneak treats for him without him knowing !!! 

this is rambly but i think the TLDR is that I am looking for ""grown up"" advice or so to speak on how I can support my wonderful boyfriend whilst he is going through the tough journey to his dream !!!",2,1733823282.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

I've been watching a lot of sports movies lately. My son recommended ""The Fighter"", starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. In the movie they are brothers, both boxers. Bale a former champion, now a drug addict, Wahlberg up and coming. But he keeps being sabotaged by his GC brother and his narcissistic mother. This nmum was a real piece of work, something along the lines of Tony Soprano's mother (the classic screen nparent). There are also a lot of flying monkey sisters in the mix.

However, the whole dynamic changes when Wahlberg meets and falls in love with Amy Adams. I won't spoil the plot for you, let's just say it was a cathartic experience to watch the family dynamic, though I do admit I had to pause the movie halfway through in order to go and make myself a cup of coffee.

1hay22f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TillSverige/comments/1hay22f/norrk√∂ping_or_ume√•_how_to_decide/,Norrk√∂ping or Ume√•? How to decide?,"I've been back and forth on this decision and I'd love another pair of eyes that isn't ChatGPT/Claude/friends who have been listening to me go in circles.

I've lived just north of Stockholm for over 12 years - when I moved here, I met someone very quickly and moved in. Due to my relationship ending, I now get to choose where I want to live. I did consider other countries, but I want to stay in Sweden. As an EU citizen, I have the right to stay. I like mostly being left alone, nature and outdoors, digitalization, the expectation to generally just be sensible.

I work remotely so job market isn't a factor.

Note: I understand Swedish just fine, and can speak it. Writing it is harder and it's more comfortable/faster for all of us if I write this in English.

I've narrowed it down to Norrk√∂ping or Ume√•.

**Here's my criteria**

* Reasonable property prices - I'd ideally like a 2a-3a, because I work remotely and would prefer a separate office. I can't see the point of staying in Stockholm when I can get so much more for my money elsewhere.  I'm using Blocket Bostad, Homeq, and other local hyresv√§rdar - I'd rent first and then buy when I know where I want to be. N√∂rrkoping has the advantage
* Ideally at least within two hours of a major airport - I know Ume√• has an airport but it mostly connects to Arlanda which makes international transfers tricky and those flights can be expensive. I travel about 4-6 times a year for work and fun.  Norrk√∂ping would have the train to Stockholm and then Arlanda.
* Lots of green and space for outdoors. I love the changing seasons and I don't care that it'll be dark in Ume√•.
* Thriving culture scene - I'd love to be able to go to the movies, see live theater, indie music, etc.
* Walkable with solid public transport.
* International scene? I don't know. I speak Swedish well enough to function well and connect with people, even though I'm already pretty introverted and like to keep to myself. The challenge is having lived in multiple countries, sometimes the international people have more context. I have no idea if this is actually important or not.
* I'm in my early 40s. The students can do their own thing, their lifestyle doesn't interest me. I want coffee, books, some good conversation, quiet, and time outside. And movies!
* Somewhere between big city and small town - I want some amenities, I'd like to not have to drive everywhere, but small enough to be cozy. I would rather like to have a car so options for parking would be nice.

I've already considered these and discarded them for various reasons:

1. Stockholm - too big, too expensive
2. Uppsala - too big, too expensive, too close to Stockholm
3. Link√∂ping - lovely, but too focused on academics per friends' feedback
4. Enk√∂ping - well located, but too small
5. V√§ster√•s - multiple friends have said it's a bad idea, negative reputation, etc.
6. √ñrebro - that castle looks cool! Probably too big, too far away from airports.
7. Lund - could be interesting, but so much focus on academia. Looks pretty.
8. Malm√∂ - excellent connections with Kastrup! Prices are on the rise and frankly, I'd rather have more snow.

**Other thoughts**

I've read about this can-do attitude in Ume√• and Norrland and I'm intrigued. I'd like to be part of a community, be able to help my neighbors, etc. I'm a member of the civil defense but not really sure what to do with it.

Ume√• is a long way from anywhere. The distances up there are just so big. I'll still be able to get deliveries, but buying and selling on Blocket for second hand goods would be harder with the smaller market. I don't know how much of a problem this really is

I've considered moving to both for a year and seeing what they're actually like. That would be a lot of moving and back and forth, though, and it would be nice to find a place to settle. I'm open to finding a short term furnished rental, for example, though ideally somewhere I can bring cats.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm considering starting a small vending machine business in Canada and would love some insights from experienced business owners. My idea is to place 24/7 accessible vending machines outdoors in small towns and villages. Inspired by Japan, where vending machines are accessible even in rural areas.

The focus of my vending machines would be:

Hot and Cold Drinks: Offering beverages that people can grab quickly, whether it‚Äôs coffee or soda, regardless of the time.

24/7 Accessibility: Placing machines in plazas, near restaurants, grocery stores, or community hubs(outside).

Cashless Payments: Using NFC payments like Apple Pay, QR codes, and tap-to-pay cards to align with modern payment trends and reduce theft risks.

Partnering with Farmers: Providing fresh produce sourced locally at a lower cost compared to grocery stores, making healthy options more accessible for the community.


I have some key concerns and questions I‚Äôd love feedback on:

1. Types of Machines

What kind of vending machines are best suited for outdoor use in Canada, where winters can hit -20¬∞C and bring snow and ice?

Are there specific features (e.g., heating, insulation, reinforced casing) I should prioritize to ensure durability?

Should I invest in new machines with the latest technology or look for pre-owned machines?

2. Costs and Maintenance

What‚Äôs the typical upfront investment for a reliable, weatherproof vending machine equipped with cashless payment systems?

How much should I budget for regular maintenance and repairs, especially for machines left outdoors year-round?

How often do machines need to be serviced?


3. Theft and Vandalism

How common are theft or vandalism issues for outdoor vending machines?

Are there specific security measures you‚Äôd recommend, like reinforced casings, surveillance cameras, or tamper alarms?

Do cashless systems significantly reduce theft risks, or are there still challenges with vandalism?

Is there insurance for vending machines?


4. Partnering with Farmers

For those who‚Äôve partnered with local suppliers or farmers, how do you manage logistics like restocking fresh produce?

What‚Äôs the best way to market this collaboration to the community?

Are there legal or health regulations I should consider when selling fresh produce through vending machines?


5. General Business Insights

For those who‚Äôve started a vending machine business or similar ventures, what are some unexpected challenges you faced?

Are there any ‚ÄúI wish I knew this before I started‚Äù lessons you‚Äôd share?

What‚Äôs the best way to identify high-traffic locations or negotiate placement deals with property owners?


6. Scaling the Idea

How do you expand a vending machine business from one machine to multiple locations?

Are there opportunities to diversify offerings, such as adding more locally sourced goods or specialty items?

How do you balance initial investments with the long-term goal of profitability?


I‚Äôm still in the planning and research phase, and this is more of an idea I‚Äôd like to turn into a long-term business. I‚Äôm trying to gather as much information as possible, so I‚Äôd really appreciate advice from anyone with experience in vending machines or small businesses

__- About two weeks ago, I had this sudden urge to explore Middle Eastern perfumes as they were getting a-lot of hype. So, it‚Äôs my first time trying them out.__

# ‚ü∂ Perfume Review :
 - __Afnan 9PM__ - _Sweet and playful. It‚Äôs got a DNA that‚Äôs similar to JPG Ultra Male and the OG. It‚Äôs perfect for winter and it lasts a long time._ ___>!10/10!<___
--

- __Lattafa Asad__ - _It‚Äôs a mature fragrance with a dark, spicy scent that exudes an expensive aura. It performs exceptionally well right outta the box, lasting around 5-6 hours. However, I believe it could benefit from some maturation to fully develop its complexity. The vanilla note adds a pleasant depth to the fragrance. While it‚Äôs not my personal style, I can still wear it with a suit and find it enjoyable. I‚Äôd rate it_ ___>!7/10!<___
--

- __Afnan Turathi Blue__ - _This fragrance is so good. It‚Äôs underrated imo. I‚Äôll definitely be using it instead of Blue de Chanel. Tho it smells different from BDC, but if you really try to sniff it out, you‚Äôll notice the similarities. And for the price, you can‚Äôt go wrong._ ___>!9/10!<___
--

- __Afnan SNOI 150ml__ - _Amazing scent profile. The black currant really shines through. It‚Äôs perfect for fall and summer. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the opening, but once it settles down, it becomes really nice._ ___>!8.5/10!<___
--

- __Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa__ - _This perfume smells incredible. From the opening to the dry down. I‚Äôm not sure I quite understand the coffee note, but it‚Äôs definitely not overpowering. Instead, it comes across as a warm, sweet caramel scent. And It lasts forever. I highly recommend it._ ___>!11/10!<___
--

- Armaf CDNIM PP - _The opening was a bit rough, but it really turned around and became quite enjoyable. It def needs maturation as the performance is not so great rn (2-3 hours) but after a few months I bet It‚Äôll definitely get better and get you a lot of compliments. And the dry down is incredible. Can be a signature scent very easily._ ___>!8.5/10!<___

### ‚ûù Top 3 for Me :
1) Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa
2) Afnan 9PM
3) Afnan Turathi Blue

_Being a 17y/o i love sweet and playful scent profiles. So yk.._

> __TLDR: I was genuinely impressed by the performance and quality of these Middle Eastern dupes. It really made me rethink all the money I‚Äôve spent on designer fragrances. Sure, They can be a bit synthetic (just like some designer perfumes), but honestly I doubt anyone would notice unless they‚Äôre a fragrance enthusiast. Lets be real tho, people often go for designer or niche perfumes for the status they bring, so there‚Äôs that. But I‚Äôm definitely starting to see why Middle Eastern dupes have such a loyal following. If you‚Äôve got any solid recommendations lmk.__

Despite so many times in trying, I'm going to do it this time.

I'm going to post every day on this group for accountability.

Only one black decaf coffee a day.

I reckon I've had 10,000 coffees over my life (32 yo). That is way too much for someone with anxiety.

1haxtzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1haxtzs/a_few_points_of_guidance_for_a_newbie_i_includes/,A few points of guidance for a newbie. I includes buying advice grinder [¬£250],"I'm UK based, my partner and I started drinking coffee (Starbucks! Boooo) 10 years ago after we had our first child. Long story short we've had a pod machine but since I've found a few independent places that serve nice coffee, I've kind of gone off it. 

I've since plunged into the espresso world and I have a number of buying and technical questions I don't seem to be able to nail down from searching previous posts. At least I think more insight from you all in 2024 might help me. I have managed to pick a baby gaggia unfortunately ¬£60 in descent nic and I have a few questions about that and grinders

1. Baby Gaggia pour ""limits""

I've read a little about due to the gaggia having a small boiler, it isn't recommended to do 20+ baskets as they struggle towards the end.

Does anyone have personal experience of this and could share

2. Linked to number 1 really, we will be drinking one cappuccino or espresso in the morning together, so ideally I'd do one pour. I've been experimenting with pre ground and this morning I put 18g in the larger pressurised basket that comes with the machine. 

- the coffee wasn't quite strong enough for me
- the basket definately didn't have anymore room to add another couple g of coffee as putting the portafilter back in was tight let's say.

On above basis when I pick up a basket to be used for coffee I grind myself, should I go for a 20g basket. Or...

- is that pointless due to the baby's limitations in pour
- pouring 2 cups from one puck won't be the best whatever i do, best going for a 16g basket and accepting I need to do two pucks?

Lastly on that point alongside your views I'd appreciate hearing your basket recommendations (read next point re my grinder choices)

3. I've set myself a budget of ¬£250 for a grinder. We will exclusively be drinking espresso. I've narrowed it down (unless any of you blow it out the water) to either the Eureka Mignon Manuale 50 at ¬£240 and the DF54 at ¬£240, both new.

Straight off the bat, I prefer the idea of buying from the established Italian company rather than a random Chinese factory. I appreciate the parts of the Eureka likely come from China, but I like the idea of supporting a ""coffee brand"", especially a European one. My main question are as follows (im happy both would do a good job of grinding fine for espresso)

- alot of reviews or advice talks about ""if you want single dose get the DF54"" could someone explain this point of view. What stops you simply putting a single dose into the hopper on the Eureka? Or I'd it just an aesthetic thing.
- I watched a coffee kev video about grinders and under ¬£250 he basically recommends the DF54, but the Eureka isn't even in the equation. I take it that's because the Eureka is typically ¬£300
- other than slightly bigger burs, a timer/weigher, sound proofing, what else am I missing on the manuale. 

I'm very tempted by the ¬£240 manuale but there's very little online about it and I'm wondering why it's so cheap compared to the other Eurekas.

He was super sweet, and warm, and loving, and it triggered me to the max. I couldnt talk about anything personal or emotional, the affection he showed me made me scared and caused me to be cold and distant. I felt anxiety and shame - and HE NOTICED all of this. 

By the first date he told me I ""have many secrets... shouldnt be so tense"" by the second date he said im a ""PSYCOPATH"" and ""too tough"". The criticism made me even more avoidant and I stopped talking about myself altogether & turned every question he asked me back to him. 

On our last date we fell asleep in his apartment, he was sweet and considerate but I was so cold and anxious by all the closness. I kept saying things I knew he wouldnt like, anything that would keep him away and even (slightly) offend him... and in the morning I couldnt stand the cuddling and had to wake him up and leave asap. He asked if I wanted coffee or if he can walk me to the bus station, but I BOLTED out of there. All while making jokes and keeping the conversation shallow, trolling him, laughing and avoiding any intimacy (physical / emotional). 
2 days later he called to tell me he is looking for ""something else at the moment"" and ended it.

This friend lets call them Taylor talks behind a student whos Jewish, lets call them Anna. Anna and another girl (Eve) used to be so close, they hung out often and were very close Anna was very concerned about Taylor's behavior and how they used to talk bad about everyone, and warned Eve. Eve got mad about it and Taylor got mad and I think they started to manipulate Eve. Eve and Taylor told me that Anna is a bad person, talked bad about me calling me a pick me etc. They also told me she supports the Israelis in Palestine and has a shrine for the Prime minister.

Today Anna confronted me with a cup of coffee and apologised in their name and feels bad for staying quiet through their discussions and not saying word, telling me that Taylor would laugh and  make  fun of all of my moves calling me socically inept (when they legit walked up to my bsf in uni‚ÄîOlivia‚Äîand took aa fucking tomato with no questions asked). As Olivia, Anna and I were on break, we told her what Taylor has been telling us which really triggered her causing her to leave the lecture early.

Whether you're sipping coffee at a Venice Beach caf√© or working remotely from downtown, your online privacy could be at risk. I've spent countless hours testing and analyzing the top VPNs to help you make the smart choice for staying safe online in the City of Angels.

# Why You Really Need a VPN in Los Angeles

Let me tell you a quick story. Last week, while working from my favorite spot near Staples Center, I noticed something concerning. The ""Free LA WiFi"" network I almost connected to? It was a fake hotspot set up by hackers. This is exactly why having a reliable VPN in Los Angeles isn't optional anymore.

**Key Risks in LA:**

* Hackers targeting public WiFi networks
* Government surveillance (5-Eyes Alliance member)
* Data theft at popular tourist spots
* Streaming service limitations

# The Top VPNs for Los Angeles: Tested & Verified

After putting numerous services through their paces, here are the VPNs that stood out:

# 1. ExpressVPN: The Speed King of LA

**What makes it special:**

* 4 super-fast server locations in LA
* Unbeatable streaming performance
* Advanced security features that don't slow you down

I spent a month testing ExpressVPN across different LA locations. The speeds are mind-blowing - watching Lakers games in HD on ESPN+ was smooth as butter, even during peak hours.

**Real test results:**

* Local server ping: Under 5ms
* Download speeds: 95% of my base connection
* Streaming: No buffering on any platform

# 2. CyberGhost: Your Public WiFi Guardian

What grabbed my attention about CyberGhost was its automatic WiFi protection feature. When testing at LAX, it kicked in instantly when sketchy networks popped up.

**Standout features:**

* Smart rules for public WiFi
* 136+ LA-based servers
* Outstanding streaming optimization

# 3. [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/SH9D7): Double Security for Peace of Mind

NordLynx, their custom protocol, is a game-changer for LA users. During testing at busy spots like The Grove, the double encryption didn't impact speeds noticeably.

**Security highlights:**

* Double VPN routing
* Built-in threat protection
* Perfect for banking security

# Smart Tips for Using VPNs in Los Angeles

Here's what I learned from months of testing:

1. Pick servers in nearby cities for better speeds
2. Use specialized streaming servers for Netflix US
3. Enable auto-connect on public networks

# Final Thoughts: Safety Meets Speed

Living in or visiting LA shouldn't mean choosing between security and performance. After extensive testing, ExpressVPN hits the sweet spot - lightning speeds, rock-solid security, and unmatched streaming abilities.

Not sure which VPN to pick? Start with ExpressVPN. Connect to an LA server, stream your favorite show, and experience what premium security feels like. They offer a solid money-back guarantee, so there's no risk in trying it out.

Remember, staying safe online in LA isn't just about having a VPN - it's about having the right one. Choose wisely, stay secure, and enjoy everything the digital side of Los Angeles has to offer.",1,1733821649.0,TheVpnEng,0,1.0,False
1haxrq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1haxrq2/proofreading_my_improvised_nitro_cold_brew/,Proofreading my improvised (Nitro) Cold Brew extraction method,"Hello, I've lately been interested in making nitro cold brew at home, but curiosity got the best of me and I've wanted to tinker with the method since I've started reading [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Coffee-brewing-control-chart-for-water-hardness-70-ppm-109-ppm-and-290-ppm_fig1_360413314). Unbeknownst to me, I wasn't aware of how time efficient vacuum extractions were (compared to traditional methods), so after reading this I've tried to follow along the article and understand it as precisely as I can (I'm not used to food science or scientific jargon). From what I've understood, this method (technically) would be able to extract the coffee to a satisfactory range in around 2-3 300s 200mbar vacuum cycles. To this I've tried putting together a method, along with some possibilities and questions for variants.

# Ingredients and tools

\- 1:14 500g weight ratio of coffee grounds/water, kept separate (cold temperature preferably)  
\- Course ground medium roast high quality coffee  
\- Moderate hardness water  
\-(Optional) undefined amount of ethanol or vodka (for ethanol soluble phenol extraction)  
\- Mason jar (kept cold) with vacuum pump (minimum -80kpa)  
\-(Optional) Food safe magnetic stirrer to keep extraction even  
\- 2 NO2 (foodsafe) cartridges  
\- Whipped cream charger (preferably cold)

# Method

1. Mix coffee grounds (with vodka) and hard water in jar (add stirring magnet if necessary).  
  
2. Begin 2-3 extraction cycles:  
\- Pump out air until 200mbar  
\- Let extract for 300 seconds (stirring if possible)  
\- Stop extraction by shocking back to room pressure (1013mbar or 1 atm)  
\- Repeat.  
  
3. Extract solution from jar without coffee grounds (nor stirring magnet) into whipped cream charger.

4. Pump it with first NO2 charge, let charger rest refrigerated for (undefined, 1-3) hours.

5. Pump second NO2 charge, serve.

# Concerns and doubts

Related to this extraction, I have food safety concerns for the modified atmosphere inside the charger during the pressurization because of botulism, and also greater concerns about the structural stress for the mason jar during extraction. If vodka or ethanol is used to extract, it would be helpful to keep the contents inside the jar while inside the vacuum cold so the ethanol doesn't boil off and create pressure inside the vacuum, worsening the extraction cycle, on top of that I'm unsure of possible chemical reactions of the ethanol with NO2 inside the charger which may deteriorate the pressurization or just make the extraction unsafe.  
  
Other than that, I'm here to be corrected if at any point of this process something wrong may happen before I try it out. If anyone got a suggestion to make, I'd deeply appreciate it before I get started.",1,1733821596.0,foodscience,0,1.0,False

Hi guys! 

In the last three days i noticed that my heart does a weird thing. 

Randomly (could be one time in an hour, multiple times in an hour, multiple times in a minute) i feel like it skips a beat and the one after is way stronger. 
Today is getting worse, as it's doing this thing 2/3 times per minute. 

I can clearly feel the first beat arriving late and the beat after is felt in all my arteries, mostly in my throat. 

It seems to be getting worse when I'm resting. 

Not really any other symptoms. 

About me:
I'm 23M, 1.80 m tall (6ft), 65kg, i smoke and drink a few beers per week. I walk a lot and eat well. No previous medical issues and i don't take any medication. 
I used to drink like 4 coffees per day but in the last months, due to insomnia i drastically reduced and only drink one in the morning. 

I'm under a bit of anxiety later but this does not feel like typical anxiety issue. 

I pretty worried. I've got a visit in 2 days. Can you guys help me figure out what it is? 

I will provide as much details as needed. 

Thank you so much in advance, please help me figure it out. I can be paranoid and this thing is mentally killing me. ",0,1733821587.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic dental procedure that promises brighter smiles and increased confidence. Many people turn to teeth whitening treatments with high hopes, excited about the results they can achieve. Understanding the impact of teeth whitening involves looking closely at both the before and after changes that occur, as well as the various options available to help you achieve your desired results.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Methods

Before you start your teeth whitening journey, it's essential to know the different methods available. Each method boasts unique benefits and potential results:

- **In-Office Treatments:** These are performed by dental professionals and can provide immediate results. They often utilize powerful whitening agents.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits often contain custom trays and whitening gel for gradual results. They allow you to control the treatment schedule.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Available in pharmacies, these products range from strips to toothpaste. They are convenient but may provide less dramatic results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people use baking soda or activated charcoal. While these options are generally safe, results may vary widely.

### Understanding Before and After Results

Seeing the results from teeth whitening can be thrilling. A significant change from before to after can boost self-esteem and enhance your smile. However, it‚Äôs important to have realistic expectations. Here‚Äôs what you might notice:

- **Shade Improvement:** Most people experience several shades of whitening after treatment. It is typical to go from a dull, yellowish hue to a bright, vibrant shade.
- **Enhanced Smile:** A whiter smile can make you appear more youthful and healthier. It often leads to increased confidence in social situations.
- **Temporary Sensitivity:** Some individuals may experience tooth sensitivity after treatment, which often subsides shortly after completing the process.

### The Psychological Effects

The transformation from before to after not only affects your physical appearance but can also have profound psychological effects. The impact of teeth whitening can be seen in several areas:

- **Confidence Boost:** Brightening your smile can significantly enhance your self-esteem, making you feel more attractive and willing to engage with others.
- **Social Interaction:** A brighter smile can foster better social interactions. You might find yourself smiling more, which can create a positive feedback loop.

- **Regular Dental Check-Ups:** Schedule routine appointments with your dentist to monitor your oral health and maintain your beautiful smile.

### Potential Risks and Considerations

While the benefits of teeth whitening are appealing, it‚Äôs important to consider potential risks. Some individuals may experience:

- **Tooth Sensitivity:** A common side effect, but it usually goes away within a few days.
- **Gum Irritation:** If a whitening agent comes into contact with gums, it can cause irritation.
- **Uneven Results:** Some dental work, like crowns or veneers, may not respond to whitening, leading to mismatched shades.

The journey of teeth whitening is different for everyone, but the transformation can be significant. Evaluating the before and after results will help you appreciate the improvements and understand the effort needed to maintain that dazzling smile. With the right approach, you can enjoy all the benefits a whiter smile brings!

### Understanding Teeth Whitening Options

There are various teeth whitening methods available that vary in safety and effectiveness. Here are some popular choices:

- **Professional Whitening Treatments:** Conducted by dentists, these treatments typically use stronger bleaching agents. Pros include immediate results and customized care, ensuring safety and efficacy.
- **In-Office Whitening Kits:** These products are provided by dental professionals and are similar to professional treatments. They can ensure safe application, making them a great choice for those looking for quicker results.
- **At-Home Whitening Kits:** Available over-the-counter, these kits come with trays and whitening gel. Ensure you use kits approved by dental boards to minimize risks.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** While less effective than other methods, whitening toothpaste contains mild abrasives for surface stain removal. This can be a gentle way to maintain your whitening results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some individuals prefer home remedies like baking soda or activated charcoal. While these can help with stains, overuse can lead to enamel erosion, so it is crucial to exercise caution.

### Ensuring Safety During Whitening

To protect your dental health, consider the following safety tips when whitening your teeth:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consult Your Dentist:** Before starting any whitening regimen, consult a dental professional. They can recommend the best approach based on your oral health and specific needs.
- **Follow Instructions:** Whether using at-home kits or professional treatments, always follow the provided instructions. Overuse can lead to tooth sensitivity and gum irritation.
- **Check Ingredients:** Ensure that the whitening agents are safe and approved. Avoid products with high concentrations of bleaching agents that can harm your enamel.
- **Limit Frequency:** Even the safest methods should not be overused. Consider whitening your teeth every six months to maintain results without risking damage.
- **Watch for Sensitivity:** If you notice increased sensitivity during or after whitening, stop using the product and consult your dentist. They may recommend special toothpaste to help manage sensitivity.

### Maintaining Your Bright Smile

Once you've achieved the desired level of whiteness, maintaining your results is key. Follow these tips to keep your smile bright:

- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly. Use fluoride toothpaste to strengthen enamel and protect against stains.
- **Avoid Stain-Causing Foods:** Certain foods and drinks, like coffee, red wine, and berries, can stain your teeth. Limit their consumption or rinse your mouth with water after consuming them.
- **Consider Touch-Ups:** If your teeth start to lose their brightness, consider touch-up treatments as needed, but always prioritize safety.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps wash away food particles and acidity that can lead to staining.

### Common Myths About Teeth Whitening

Many myths surround teeth whitening that can deter people from seeking effective methods. Let‚Äôs clarify a few:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Is Harmful:** Many safe methods exist that pose minimal risk when applied correctly. Professional supervision reduces potential side effects.
- **All Products Work the Same:** Not every product is created equal. Professional treatments are typically more effective than over-the-counter options.
- **Whitening Causes Permanent Sensitivity:** Sensitivity is often temporary and can be managed with the right care and products.

Choosing the right teeth whitening method is essential for a brighter, healthier smile. By embracing safe practices and consulting professionals, you can achieve your desired results while safeguarding your oral health.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can significantly enhance your smile, boosting your confidence and overall appearance. When you see before and after results, the transformation is often stunning. These changes inspire many individuals to pursue brighter smiles, showcasing the power of a radiant grin. However, it's essential to approach teeth whitening with caution. The impact of whitening treatments can vary based on the method chosen, making it crucial to select safe procedures that uphold your dental health.

Whether you opt for professional treatments or at-home solutions, always prioritize options that don't compromise the integrity of your enamel or contribute to sensitivity. Procedures must be effective and safe, ensuring that the results not only look great but also support your long-term oral health. Regular consultations with a dental professional can guide you toward the best whitening methods tailored to your needs.

Market analysis shows that SI1 has become the most popular clarity grade for engagement rings in the natural diamonds market, accounting for 35% of all purchases due to its exceptional value proposition.

This strategic guide provides advanced techniques for identifying top-performing SI1 diamonds, including shape-specific selection criteria, inclusion assessment protocols, and expert methodologies for maximizing value in this optimal clarity grade.

# Bottom Line

SI1 diamonds offer excellent value for buyers seeking a balance between visual appeal and affordability. Here are the key points to consider:

* Most SI1 diamonds appear eye-clean without magnification, making them suitable for engagement rings.
* They cost about 25% less than higher clarity grades like VS1, with little noticeable difference in appearance.
* Cut quality is crucial - a well-cut SI1 diamond can mask inclusions and enhance overall brilliance.
* Individual assessment is vital, as SI1 diamonds vary significantly in the type, location, and severity of inclusions.
* Finding a good SI1 diamond is hard, so take your time and do deep research.
* Always opt for diamonds with reputable grading reports (GIA or AGS) and thorough evaluations from vendors.
* For larger diamonds (2 carats and above), SI1 inclusions may be more visible, potentially requiring a higher clarity grade.
* Lab-grown diamonds often achieve higher clarity grades more easily, potentially offering better value in the SI1 range.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

Camus pun mengatakan hal yang sama, apapun yang terjadi, entah kamu hidup, maati ataupun sedang menikmati secangkir kopi. Marthin Luther King menyatakan kekerasan tidak pernah membawa perdamaian abadi. Gandhi mengatakan bahwa jalan tanpa kekerasan adalah kekuatan paling besar yang dimiliki manusia. 

>*That‚Äôs who they tell you are heroes. That‚Äôs who our revolutionaries are*.

Mereka mengatakan bahwa kamu adalah pahlawan. Bahwa revolusi sesungguhnya adalah tanpa kekerasan. 

>*Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.*

Namun, tidakakah ini pro Kapitalis? Prinsip tanpa kekerasan memungkinkan sistem ini berjalan dengan leluasa.

>They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her toes and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first, the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.

Mereka mendiagnosa ibu saya dengan neuropathy berat ketika dia berusia 41 tahun. Semua bermula sejak 10 tahun sebelumnya dengan rasa terbakar di ujung jempol kakinya dan rasa tertusuk yang tajam. Mulanya, rasa sakit hanya berlangsung beberapa saat, lalu memudar menjadi rasa gatal, dan rasa kebas, dan hilang sampai beberapa hari dan muncul kembali. 

>The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point, by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor.

Saat pertama nyerinya datang, dia mengacuhkannya. Lalu nyeri tersebut datang makin sering, beberapa kali dalam setahun, dan ia masih mengacuhkannya. Lalu setiap beberapa bulan. Lalu setiap beberapa kali dalam seminggu. Pada saat itu, ketika rasa gatal berangsur menjadi kebas, maka rasa sakitnya akan langsung muncul kembali, rasa tidak nyamannya menetap dan tidak pernah hilang. Saat itu, beranjak dari sofa ke dapur untuk membuat makan siangnya sendiripun sudah tidak bisa dia lakukan dengan mudah.

>She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back to ibuprofen.

Dia mengobatinya sendiri dengan ibuprofen, sampai perutnya nyeri dan asam lambungnya membuatnya beralih ke paracetamol. Kemudian rasa sakit kepala dan gangguan tidurnya membuatnya kembali ke Ibuprofen. 

>The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.

Dokter pertama mengatakan ini hanya gejala psikosomatis saja, tidak ada yang salah. Dia hanya perlu beristirahat, mengendalikan stres dan memperbaiki pola tidurnya.

>The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.

Dokter kedua mengatakan ada penjepitan syaraf di tulang belakangnya. Dia membutuhkan operasi tulang belakang. Perkiraan biasanya sebesar  $180,000 (Rp 28.5 M, Kurs 1USD = 15.850, 10/12/2024). Masa pemulihan diperkirakan 6 bulan sebelum dia bisa berjalan lagi. Dua belas bulan sampai pemulihan maksimal, dan dia tidak boleh mengangkat lebih dari 4,5 kg.

>The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test cost $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn‚Äôt able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.

Dokter ketiga melakukan Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, dan tes darah. Setiap test berbiaya $800 (Rp 12,6 jt, Kurs 1USD = 15.850, 10/12/2024), sampai $1200 (Rp 19 jt, Kurs 1USD = 15.850, 10/12/2024). Dia mencapai plafon maksimal tahunan UnitedHealthcare pada bulan Oktober sebesar $6000 (Rp95 jt, Kurs 1USD = 15.850, 10/12/2024). Kemudian dokternya pergi berlibur, dan pemeriksaan lanjutn baru bisa dilakukan di Januari lagi ketika plafon asuransinya diperbaharui.

>The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.

Hasil tes menunjukan neuropathy berat. Andai kami melakukan operasi senilai Rp 28.5 M, tindakan itu tetap akan percuma saja.

>They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first, the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn‚Äôt tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7 am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.

Para dokter meresepkan psikotropika untuk nyerinya. Mulanya, rasa nyeri yang berkurang jelas sepadan dengan rasa ngefly dan sembelit yang dirasakan. Ibu tidak pernah bercerita kepadaku tentang hal ini hingga baru-baru ini. Yang bisa kuingat adalah kami melakukan perjalanan bersama setelah sekilan tahun. Dia mengajak ke Monterey. Disana aku melihaat berang-berang berenang di kehidupan nyata, bersandar pada punggungnya. Kami berangkat Pk 07.00 dan mendengarakan Green Day selama 4 jam perjalanan. Seiring waktu, psikotropika tidak lagi bermanfaat. Prikotropika membuatnya lebih sensitif terhadap nyeri dan gejala putus obatnya akan mungul dalam hanya 2 atau 3 jam.

Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn't exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go an entire day without getting out of bed.

Kemudian dokter beralih ke gabapenting. Pada saat ini nyerinya begitu hebat sehingga dia tidak bisa beraktifitas, akibatnya berat badannya naik dan siklus hormonalnya kacau. Semua ini, termasuk nyerinya menyebabkan dia selalu lelah walaupun dia hanya berada di tempat tidur. 

>Then Corticosteroids. Which didn‚Äôt even work.

Lalu dokter beralih ke kortikosteroid. Tidak ada efeknya sama sekali.

>The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she‚Äôs OK. Eventually, I stopped getting up. She'd yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word ‚Äúfuck‚Äù stretched and distended to its limits. I'd turn over and go back to sleep

Nyerinya begitu hebat hingga sering terdengar ibuku menjerit di tengah malam. Aku berlari ke kamarnya menanyakan apakah dia baik-baik saja. Sampai suatu hari, aku tidak lagi terbangun. Sekalipun dia meneriakan kata-kata makian. Aku hanya berbalik, dan kembali tidur. 

>All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother's suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.

Semua ini terjadi sambil mereka menguras kami kering dengan pertemuan ke pertemuan, konsultasi spesialis, dan pemeriksaan penunjang.  Setiap pemeriksaan dijanjikan akan dijamin, sampai kemudian pihak asuransi menunda dan menolaknya. Pengobatan alternataif sama sekali tidak membantu. Sekali lagi, inilah yang terjadi di masyarakat kita. 

>My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones splintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.

Ibuku mengatakan bahwa pada hari yang ringan, nyerinya terasa seperti kakinya terendam dalam air es. Pada hari yang berat, kakinya serasa dihimpitkn diantara mesin giling, ada rasa terpelintir dan tulangnya terasa hancur. Dia lebih sering mengalami hari yang berat daripada hari yang ringan. 

>My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.

Dia merangkak ke kamar mandi dengan tangan dan lututnya. Aku tidur di ruang keluarga untuk menghindari teriakan dan tangisannya di tengah malam. Aku tetap terbangun setiap kali itu terjadi, tapi setelahnya aku tetap kembali tidur. 

>  
Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.

Lagipula, bukankah tidak ada yang bisa aku lakukan? 

>The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as ‚Äúnot medically necessary.‚Äù Old treatments didn‚Äôt work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.

Biaya yang harus kami tanggung diluar asuransi membuat perawatan rutin menjadi tidak mungkin. Tindakan dan perawatan baru ditolak dengan alasan ""tidak diperlukan secara medis"", sedangkan tindakan-tindakan sebelumnya tidak membuahkan hasil dan itupun tetap harus kami bayar. 

>UnitedHealthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year. Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment. Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.

UnitedHealthcare membatasi kunjungan spesialis hanya sampai dua kali dalam setahun. Mereka juga menolak menanggung biaya advanced imaging  (catatan : Kemungkinan MRI atau CT Scan Kontras) yang diperlukan dokter spesialis untuk pemeriksaaan. Persetujuan asuransi membutuhkan waktu mingguan, kemudian bulanan. 

>UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother's doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor's typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.

UnitedHealthcare secara rutin merubah prosedur klaim mereka. Mereka mengatakan dokter harus mengirimkan fax. Kemudian UnitedHealthcare mengatakan mereka tidak menyimpan fax tersebut dan membutukan berkas fisik dan harus dikirimkan. Kemudian mereka masih beralasan tidak pernah menerima catatan tersebut. Mereka tidak bisa menyetujui klaim sampai mereka sudah menerima berkas dan melengkapinya. 

>They promised coverage and broke their word to my mother.

Mereka menjanjikan keamanan terhadap biaya kesehatan dan mereka mengingkari janjinya padaku, pada ibuku yang kesakitan. 

>With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.

Dengan penundaan demi penundaan. Dengan bantahan dan sangkalan yang semakin menjadi. Ingin rasanya kulempar dokter itu keluar dari jendela kaca rumah sakitnya.

>But it wasn‚Äôt them. It wasn‚Äôt the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.

Kemudian aku sadar, itu bukan salah dokter, bukan salah resepsionis, petugas administrasi, apoteker, ataupun petugas radiologi atau salah siapapun juga, melainkan UnitedHealthcare.

>People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of America

Banyak orang-orang sekarat. Dan iblis-iblis ini dengan menghasilkan miliaran dollar dari  jutaan warga Amerika yang kesakitan, menderita, sekarat dan menangis pilu.

>We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it‚Äôs legal that no one can punish them.

Kami digiring ke perjanjian kontrak untuk ""menjamin kebutuhan medis"". Lalu UnitedHealthcare menentukan peraturan yang menguntungkana mereka. Mereka merasa mereka bisa membuat peraturannya karena tidak ada yang akan menghukum mereka. 

>They think there's no one out there who will stop them.

Mereka berpikir tidak seorangpun disana yang bisa menghentikan mereka.

>Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.

Sekarang, nyeri punggungku membangunkanku di tengah malam berteriak kesakitan. Aku akan mencari penyembuhan yang sejati, menghilangkan semua masalah ini untuk kita semua. 

>I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.

Aku menunggu dengan sabar, hingga kekuatan terakhirku untuk serangan terakhir. Semua yang bertanggung jawab harus merasakan rasa sakit yang sama seperti yang sudah mereka sebabkan ke jutaan orang. 

>As our own chief executives, it‚Äôs our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.

Sebagai seorang komandan tertinggi perjuangan kita. Kewajiban kita sendirilah untuk membuat hidup kita lebih baik. Pertama dan terutama, kita harus melihat situasi kita dan mempertahankan diri kita. Dengan cara seperti itulah, tindakan kita juga akan bermanfaat bagi orang lain. 

>Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws, like the properties of gravity, magnetism, or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.

Peraturan terjadi diantara dua pihak diseluruh dunia ini. Beberapa peraturan merupakan sesuatu yang tertulis. Beberapa terjadi karena rasa saling menghiirmati. Beberapa terjadi karaena hukum fisika seperti gravitasi, magnet, aataupun energi potensial yang tercipta diantara ikatana kimia amonium nitrat. 

>No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US Constitution.

Tidak ada dokumen tertulis yang lebih baik dari Konstitusi Amerika yang menyatakan keyakinan bahwa setiap manusia setara, sama bernilai dan sama kewajiiban moralnya.

>Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.

Menuliskan suatu peraturan membuatnya sah sebagai hukum. Sekarang, saya sudah tidak peduli lagi terhadap hukum. Apa yang penting sekarang adalah mengikuti pemikiran kita sendiri dari yang sudah kita pelajari demi kebaikan kita sendiri, yang kemudiana juga akan menimbulkan kebaikan bagi masyarakat kita dan orang yang kita sayangi. 

>That's where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family‚Äôs health, and the health of our country‚Äôs people requires me to respond with an act of w

Ini yang UnitedHealthcare lakukan. Mereka mengkhianatii kontrak dengan ibuku, dengan ibukum dan puluhan juta warga Amerika lainnya. Mereka adalah ancaman terhadap kesehtanku, keluargaku, dan orang-orang lain. Terhadap ancaman ini, saya menyatakan perang terhadapnya.

I‚Äôm a 31-year-old orthopedic surgeon, and despite following what I think is a fairly disciplined schedule, I find myself feeling tired all day. I can‚Äôt figure out what I‚Äôm doing wrong, so I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my typical day:

4:00 AM: Wake up.

4:40‚Äì5:00 AM: Meditate.

5:00‚Äì7:30 AM: Have tea, then study (orthopedic surgery topics or software I‚Äôm interested in).

7:30 AM‚Äì9:00 AM: Gym (bro split, workout to failure).

9:00 AM: Post-gym, I have a protein shake and breakfast.


At this point, I already start feeling tired.

On alternate days, I perform 3‚Äì5 surgeries at one hospital. Afterward, I try to nap for 30 minutes to an hour, but being on call, my phone often interrupts this. The rest of the day includes seeing patients in the OPD, drinking another protein shake, and occasionally doing additional surgeries if they come up.

I try to limit stimulants like coffee and avoid them completely after 3 PM. By the evening, I‚Äôm too tired to do much else. I aim to be in bed by 8:00 PM, meditate from 8:30‚Äì9:00 PM, and fall asleep around 9:00 PM. However, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting good quality sleep. I wake up groggy and not refreshed.

I‚Äôve tried to keep my schedule efficient and balanced, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be working. Is it the workouts? The early mornings? The interrupted naps? Or something I‚Äôm missing altogether?

Any advice or suggestions would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",2,1733819048.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

I started my own company about 6 months ago and I was referred a client from my accountant where the client is an existing client at my old PAYG job. 

The client wanted to use me as his ongoing broker, yet my old boss is trying to contact me which I believe is to have a go at me and be abusive (as he did previously regarding another matter to which I blocked him). So are other colleagues at the firm are reaching me telling me the boss is trying to contact me, and one wants to catchup to have a coffee chat. 

Do I have rights to not see them or can I seek legal if they continually try to contact me and stall finance I am organising for the client? I have had no non compete in my contract I signed when I worked at the firm and this client (along with another client) was referred to me because of how good a finance broker I am.
