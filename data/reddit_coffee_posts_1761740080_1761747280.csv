1oj4tk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ELATeachers/comments/1oj4tk6/would_you_use_ai_to_help_you_give_writing_feedback/,Would you use AI to help you give writing feedback?,"Has anyone used AI to try to better understand what a student is trying to say in their writing?

I teach a Senior advanced writing course where students do a research paper with a thesis.  Nothing is at the grading stage yet, I’m still just looking at their drafts and giving feedback.

Anyhow, today after taking about 20-some minutes (with a few interruptions) to read through a particularly verbose draft that seemed to have cyclic organization, I thought…what in the world did I just read? It seemed to say the same point several times, but didn’t seem like it had enough substance make something out of that point. And the language used had a certain AI stink to it (I don’t think the student used it to write, but maybe relied on it for vocabulary suggestions or to help understand ideas in the research cited). Let’s face it, AI is a huge part of students’ lives now. 

Anyhow, I used my school admin-approved AI that is set up for privacy protections; I copied everything except the introduction (with the thesis) and asked AI if it could determine a thesis based on what was written, and it came up with one suggestion (A).  I could compare that with what the student *had* written for the thesis. I then asked it a few other questions, like how many specific examples of A were mentioned in the paper, which example was most strongly connected to A, etc. 

After reading through some of the things AI generated about the writing, I went back and looked through the parts of the paper mentioned to confirm that what is said was correct. Then, I wrote some feedback advice for the student in my own words, steering them in the direction towards being aligned with my rubric as usual. 

Anyhow, I haven’t sent the feedback yet and can still change it. I’m a little conflicted that I used AI to help me better try to get to the bottom of what the student was trying to say (Ideally, I’d have a conversation with the student themself, but there isn’t that kind of time right now) but I honestly think this still helped me provide better advice than I might have given otherwise. However, maybe that’s just an illusion.  I know that AI isn’t capable of making reliable judgments. However, I only used it to more quickly extract information from the writing that was difficult due to the poor organization, and I confirmed it afterwards. Basically, it saved me time, another cup of coffee I don’t need, and a small piece of my sanity. I am a little leery that perhaps changed my impression of the draft to be slightly more positive than I initially assessed (it said things praising the writing in ways I disagreed - I find it annoying how AI gives judgements unsolicited). I would not touch AI for my grading of the final draft, though. 

Anyhow, where would you stand on this? 

Personally, I’m reluctant to use AI because so far it has shown me it is still a clumsy, inaccurate and deceptive tool. On the other hand, my students are so integrated with an AI world now, maybe getting some experience working with it could help me (AI likely understands AI better than I can).

1oj4t0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oj4t0u/i_left_heaven_last_month_now_heaven_wants_me_back/,I Left Heaven Last Month. Now Heaven Wants Me Back.,"Hey everyone.  
It’s Matteo again.  
Or what’s left of me, anyway.

If you read my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oeq6sj/i_was_sent_by_the_vatican_to_help_a_group_of/) about the “research mission” in Sweden, you know most of my story already.  
You know what I saw under the ice. You know about the thing that, at minimum, remembers being an angel. I thought the worst part was over when I got back to Rome. I was wrong.

\---

Three days ago, shortly after I made my previous post, I received a hand-delivered letter.

Same red wax seal, same Vatican crest, except this time there was another mark pressed beneath it, as if it had been stamped before the Vatican crest was stamped over it: a faint triangle inside a circle.

***“Return immediately for debriefing regarding the disappearance of Sister Lucia.”***

No signature.  
When I arrived, they didn’t take me to any office; I was led through a maze of corridors I had never seen before, and down a spiral staircase that delved deep beneath the city. I was brought into a dimly lit room. Within the room were two other people, one whom I recognized as my Bishop, and another man, whom I did not recognize, but seemed to be wearing a lab coat. My blood froze in my veins when I noticed the now familiar insignia emblazoned on the left breast pocket of the lab coat-wearing man. A triangle, with a circle surrounding it, touching at the three points.

""Sit, Matteo. We have much to discuss,"" my Bishop began, a grave look on his face, ""This is Dr. Kruger, he oversees the facility where you were sent recently, and has brought some disturbing allegations against you."" He finished.

Dr. Kruger smiled slyly and turned a laptop to face me.  ""We have evidence to suggest that you were directly involved in Lucia's disappearance,"" he said, poison dripping from every word.

They showed me camera footage, presumably from the morning of my departure from Sweden. It showed the van that had picked us up from and dropped us back off at the airport, dropping *three* people back off, instead of just two. The camera feed switched to show another angle. This time, I could see the three figures walking down an otherwise empty terminal before the two on the outside grabbed the one in the middle and pulled them into a maintenance service door. The footage fast-forwarded, showing only two figures walking out.

In the video, it looked like Father Gabriel and I were responsible for Lucia’s disappearance.

I was unable to speak. The rage building in me had almost reached a fever pitch when the doctor continued.

""The other person of interest, whom you may know as Father Gabriel, has already agreed to cooperate with us in this 'investigation,'” he said, “It would be in your best interest to do the same. If you refuse, your Church will denounce you publicly. You’ll spend the rest of your life in a prison cell. Or worse, in one of ours.”

I looked to my Bishop for any sign of understanding; instead, I saw him looking at the floor, seemingly unable to make eye contact with me.

Then Dr. Kruger slid a folder across the table. Inside: a plane ticket north, and a single phrase typed on Vatican letterhead, with a wall of blacked-out text beneath it.

***“Theta-7 - Reactivation phase.”***

The doctor took my phone, and he and I departed that night.

\---

***""It looks like I'm headed back to Heaven.""***

I thought to myself. I told myself I accepted because I wanted answers, but the truth is, I accepted because I was afraid; I had no doubt that they would be capable of framing me with the disappearance, and even less doubt that they would dispose of me at a moment's notice, if I didn't comply.

They flew me in under the same gray sky and drove me down the same road back to that same blasphemous mountain.

The sign on the road was still there, but this time it read slightly differently:

***“Welcome to Heaven, permanent population: 3.”***

The gate, which had already looked foreboding, now had a guard stationed on either side of it. Each guard was holding a rifle, and at their hip hung something that looked similar to the small metal detectors that one would see in an airport, being used by security, only these were seemingly coated in a shiny silver paint.

Inside, the chapel was rebuilt. The ice beneath the glass had been fully refrozen, and additional metal rings and wiring were installed within it. The observation deck around the chapel had been removed, and instead, a command center was placed just outside of the chapel doors, with line of sight and vocal access to the chapel. In the center of the chapel, surrounding the podiums where Gabriel, Lucia, and I once stood, was a snake of thick black wires, trailing out into the center of each wall of the room except the one on which the entrance was. Beyond the glass, I could see what appeared to be three metallic spheres, pulsating gently in a familiar pattern... Three pulses, a pause, then three pulses.

Erik met me in the hallway, thermos in hand. He looked thinner than before, eyes sunken, movements slower, as if the air itself weighed down upon him.

“Didn’t think you'd come back,” he said.

“Didn’t think I had a choice,” I replied.

A familiar voice came from behind me. “None of us did, kid.”

I turned and saw that Father Gabriel was standing at the end of the corridor, wearing the same threadbare coat as before, chewing away at his gum as usual. He looked worse than I remembered; hair gone gray, eyes sharp but hollow.

“They brought you back, too?” I asked.

“Apparently, the prodigal sons get round-trip tickets now, but I'm sure you know it wasn't a first-class seat,” he said with a bitter laugh.

Erik sighed. “Both of you, keep your voices down. The mountains have ears, you know, and we just so happen to be standing inside of one right now.”

He led us deeper into the facility, towards what I knew would be our new homes.

\---

Our quarters were in the same wing as before, though locks on the outside of the doors had been installed since our last visit. I guess what Gabriel said the first time we saw this place wasn't as far off as we had originally thought. Like before, the wing had three doors. Our two doors were open, but the third one was closed.

We were locked in our *cells* for the night. A lone guard patrolled outside our rooms, carrying an identical loadout to the ones guarding the front gate. My mind lingered on the strange silver device slung similar to how a nightstick would be on a police officer's belt. I thought to ask, but I doubt I would have received a proper answer.

That night, a folded slip of paper appeared under both our doors. No signature, just a symbol drawn in graphite: three concentric circles crossed vertically to the middle by a single line, with a solid circle in the very center.

And four words written beneath it:

***“The First Has Heard.""***

\---

The next morning, Dr. Kruger assembled everyone in the rebuilt chapel. He stood at the command center like a general surveying a battlefield. Erik watched from a console nearby, expression unreadable. A sphere, similar to the ones embedded in the walls but smaller, sat alongside us in the center of the floor, pulsing the same pattern as the others.

“Today we resume resonance testing,” Kruger announced. “Fathers Matteo and Gabriel, as well as a modified RDC, designated RDC-L-1, will serve as focal conduits.”

Gabriel muttered, “Guess that’s our fancy new job title. Could have just labeled us 'bait.'”

They handed us printed sheets of meaningless syllables; vocal tones arranged like chants with no language.

Kruger called it a “Phase-Lock Chant.”

Gabriel squinted at the page. “So… we're speaking in tongues for science now?”

Kruger smiled thinly. “I suppose, if you prefer that terminology.”

They dimmed the lights, and we began to recite. The hum beneath the floor shifted with each line, syncing to our voices. Then a whisper surfaced under the noise:

***""Be not afraid.""***

It wasn't the same voice from before. It was a feminine voice, soft, far away, as if I were hearing it from underwater. Gabriel stopped reading, visibly trembling.

""Keep cadence!” Kruger snapped.

We continued to recite from the page, but nothing else happened. It was as if the facility itself held its breath after that whisper.

Even Kruger looked uneasy, though he tried to hide it behind a professional scowl. Erik avoided my gaze, typing something rapidly into his console before shutting it off.

We were dismissed for “observation rest,” while the scientist poured over their data.

Back in the corridor, Gabriel leaned against the wall, his usual sarcasm gone.

“You heard it too, didn’t you?” he asked.

I nodded.

“Female voice. Calm, like she was teaching, not warning?” he continued the question.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “And it didn’t feel quite as… judgemental.”

Gabriel laughed once, bitterly. “Good. Maybe our guardian angel finally showed up to apologize.”

Before I could answer, Erik appeared at the end of the hall, thermos in hand, face pale.

He motioned for us to follow him to a maintenance room.

Once the door shut, he locked it from the inside and leaned against a panel.

“You two need to forget that voice,” he said. “Pretend it never happened.”

Gabriel frowned. “You heard it too, didn’t you?”

Erik didn’t answer right away. He took a slow sip of coffee, staring at the floor.

“Yeah,” he said finally. “I’ve heard her before. Most of us who’ve been here long enough have. We just don’t talk about it.”

He rubbed his eyes, looking suddenly old.

“We call her the First Witness. The name isn’t official. It’s… Purist folklore, really. They say she was the first person ever to be assimilated into the Field, long before Theta-7 was even built. Before the schism, even. Some think she’s still in there, a permanent part of it now.”

Gabriel crossed his arms. “And you believe that?”

Erik looked at him. “Some part of me wants to. The alternative is even more terrifying... That it *is* *her* voice, but it isn't *her* speaking with it.”

Later that night, I found a small notebook slid under my door. There was no symbol on it this time, but someone had written one sentence in English, with careful handwriting:

***“Her name is Anja.”***

Inside were dozens of entries, scrawled in different inks and styles. Half were impossible to read; just equations, sketches of circles, triangles, or strings of numbers.

But one line, four words repeated over and over, stood out:

***""The Second Has Answered.""***

I showed it to Gabriel the next morning.

He flipped through a few pages and sighed. “Looks like we’re officially prophets in the  madhouse now, they've even given us pamphlets.”

\---

Kruger called us to the chapel again before lunch. He didn’t mention yesterday’s voice. No one did. This time, the sphere in the center glowed brighter, the rhythm faster; three pulses, pause, three again, like before.

I could feel it in my chest.

We began the chant. Halfway through, Erik’s monitor emitted a shrill tone. He shouted something to the technicians, but they didn’t move fast enough. The hum deepened, vibrating through the floor, the walls, the marrow in my bones.

Then I heard it again. Not the soft, feminine voice from yesterday, but the booming, thunderous voice from our first stay in Sweden.

***“The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”***

Everyone froze.

Kruger screamed, “Maintain cadence!” but his voice was drowned out by the thundering of the entity's, and the screaming of alarms. The glass under our feet rippled like water. A figure took shape in the reflection; six wings of light and shadow, eyes scattered across them like stars.

Gabriel whispered, “Christ have mercy…”

The moment he spoke, the reflection looked up.

\---

The alarms blared, every light turned blood-red. Erik grabbed Kruger by the collar.

“Shut it down! It's feeding on the resonance decay from L-1!""

Kruger gasped, “We're prepared this time, the lattice will hold!”

“We weren't prepared for it to consume a near *infinite* source of resonant energy!” Erik shouted, throwing Kruger aside and running for the emergency panel.

The hum fractured into words again. Two voices, spoken as if they were two members of the same choir; the woman’s voice, soft but powerful, and the voice of a man that I did not recognize, deep and sincere, filled the room:

***“We await His arrival.”***

At that moment, the visages of a man and woman appeared above the sphere in the center of the room. The figures floated through the air above the sphere.

The reflection of the entity in the glass below us vanished, and, in an instant, a third human-shaped form appeared alongside the man and woman, similar to them but bright. Brighter than the sun. Brighter than anything I'd ever seen. I could vaguely make out the form of a single halo now encircling the heads of all three figures.

There was a flash of green, and all three began to *unravel* into strings of light. The strings of the two human visages, dim in comparison to the angelic glow of the third who had joined them, wound around each other and descended toward the sphere below.

Shortly after, the string from the entity joined the newly helical structure, weaving in between the two and binding them together. The sphere continued to pulse, but when the helix met with it, the color changed instantly; it pulsed a deep, forest green instead of the usual red.

Erik threw the switch on the emergency panel, immediately darkening every light source except for the bright green sphere in the center of the room, which had now left the tripod it was sitting on and drifted upwards between the figures, unraveling into it.

""I was too late!"" Erik shouted from the emergency panel, ""It's self-sustaining, and the entity has gained full control of L-1's energy output!""

""This is unprecedented,"" Erik gasped, ""no entity has ever attempted to interface with an RDC directly before... they're literally designed to *nullify* Field resonance...""

""That's because it's not *just* an RDC, it's a *synth...""* Kruger started, but was cut off by another choir of voices, this time the *combination of all three of the voices from before*: 

***""For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.""*** 

***---***

The air split open.

Light erupted from the sphere, no longer green but shifting through every color at once. Radiant, fluid, impossibly alive. It wasn’t brightness so much as structure: columns of illumination spiraling upward, intertwining, unspooling, and reforming into impossible geometry that my eyes refused to hold.

For a heartbeat, I could see them; the two human visages from before, still suspended above the sphere, their forms no longer made of flesh or flame, but of vibrating matter and energy. Their outlines folded inward on themselves, weaving together, their luminous strands twisting in perfect mirrored motion.

The light didn’t just rise, it climbed, self-replicating in infinite recursion, folding in on itself like hands folding in the sincerest prayer. Each movement of one line was echoed by the other, creating a lattice of living brilliance that seemed to hum with intelligence.

Somewhere between those two converging threads, a third form began to grow; not emerging from, but being born out of the sphere that their essences wound into. Wings unfolded in fractal patterns. Each feather refracting the light of a thousand collapsing novae, edges rippling with translucent fire. It was beautiful in the way that an erupting volcano might be: inescapable, inevitable, and deeply unsettling.

The figure stabilized in mid-air, the combination of all three previous figures, green sphere shimmering in the center of it where a heart would it. Six wings fully extended, its body a convergence of reflection and void; half blinding, half shadow. Every surface shimmered with shifting symbols that glowed, then vanished, then returned again in different sequences, as if the air itself were writing and erasing scripture faster than it could be read.

It looked alive, but it didn’t breathe. Instead, the whole room seemed to inhale and exhale for it, every pulse of resonance feeding its existence.

The air grew heavy, and I could feel the pattern of its heartbeat inside my chest.

Three pulses. Pause. Three again.

Behind the radiance, I caught the faintest glimpse of its face or what passed for one. Eyes, infinite in number, turned outward, as if gazing not at us, but through us. And for a moment, *just a moment*, I thought I *recognized* that face.



***""Lucia?""*** Gabriel and I asked in unison.



The entity spoke, not with a voice, but with vibration; an all-consuming resonance that shaped itself into words older than language.



***""Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in this place; escape from the mountain, lest thou be consumed.""***



That was when the world began to tremble.

\---

The hum became deafening. The entire chamber pulsed with blinding green-white light as the entity’s wings folded inward, then snapped open again as if attempting to crack the firmament itself.

Erik’s voice cut through the chaos.

“The lattice is feeding it! The whole mountain is coming apart! If we don’t move now, we’ll be part of the next testament!”

He yanked a manual override lever on the wall. A series of klaxons screamed to life, and the containment doors around the chapel began to slam shut one by one as pressure built beneath the floor.

“Move!” Erik shouted. “Sublevel access hatch, now!”

Gabriel and I ran first, half-blinded by the light, Kruger close behind us, cursing in German between gasps for air. The steel grates beneath our feet glowed red-hot, warping from the energy. The hum had turned into a heartbeat you could feel in your skull.

We reached the narrow sublevel corridor. Erik dove through last, slamming the hatch behind him as the final seal above failed with a thunderous crack.

A sound like tearing fabric echoed through the mountain; a sound so loud and low it felt like the earth itself was screaming.



Then it happened.



The mountain burst open.



The entire upper structure of Theta-7 erupted in a column of molten light that tore through the stone, splitting it cleanly down the middle. 

Rock, steel, and decades of secrecy were obliterated in an instant, vaporized in a flash of green and white.

The shockwave hit us like an invisible truck. Shrapnel from the supports embedded itself in my back, and I felt a searing pain where flames had just licked at my ankle. The tunnel we were in collapsed behind us in slow motion, stone turning to vapor before it even touched the floor. We stumbled out through a maintenance shaft, barely able to see. The air was a haze of fire and snow. From the exit at the base of the mountain, we could see open sky, quickly being covered by a cloud of debris, with flashes of lightning following shortly behind it.

A figure, vast, radiant, and terrible, rose from the fissure, its six wings unfurled like curtains of light stretching across the storm. Every wingbeat sent sheets of snow and debris cascading down the slopes. Around it, the clouds turned to gold, the sky split open, and the air turned electric with the taste of copper.

We ran. The mountain behind us groaned, the snow beneath our boots glowing from the reflected light. The hum followed us: three pulses, pause, three again. Steady, relentless. We looked back, and a wall of fire was close behind, and gaining on us by the second.

Kruger lagged behind, clutching his briefcase to his chest. Erik pulled him over the edge of a ridge where we had taken cover from the blast coming our way, and tried to hold him to the ground, but Kruger tore himself free, stumbling to the ridge and turning toward the mountain. The words tore from his throat, half prayer, half disbelief.

***“My God... it’s beautiful…”***

The fire swallowed him.

For a second, I thought he had been simply annihilated in the blast, but, as the fire passed, we looked up and saw what had become of him. Standing there, rigid and glittering in the radiant green of the pillar of fire, was a Kruger-shaped pillar of salt. Only his briefcase remained, which Erik promptly grabbed.

We got up after the fire had passed and started back running. We sprinted through the storm until our lungs burned, until the ground stopped shaking and the light behind us began to fade. Only when the sound of collapsing stone gave way to silence did we finally stop.

The wind carried a faint hum, softer now, distant. The mountain was gone. In its place stood a crater rimmed with glowing glass.

Gabriel fell to his knees. “Was that… judgment?”

None of us could speak to comment, but I think we all felt the same.

The clouds above us began to close, the auroras fading, leaving only the faint green shimmer dancing across the sky.

Erik turned to face the crater one last time, thermos still clutched in his hand. His voice trembled as he spoke.

“If that was judgment, then I have my own sins to atone for.”

He dropped the thermos onto the snow, steam hissing where it landed.

“Let’s go,” he said quietly. “I know somewhere we will be safe.""

\---

I'm posting this now from my own cellphone, which, thankfully, was inside of Kruger's briefcase. There were other things in the briefcase that Erik is still trying to make sense of. Things that, according to him, are *far* worse than just what happened to Father Gabriel and me. 

Erik led us to the main road, where we managed to hitchhike back to a city; we told the terrified driver who picked us up that we were involved in a lab explosion out in the mountains... which wasn't *entirely* false, in our defense. We were dropped off at the hospital, where my ankle and back, as well as various injuries to Father Gabriel and Erik, were treated.

From the city, we made our way back towards the mountains in a minivan purchased with Kruger's organization credit card. ""They won't miss a few this much money, not after a literal mountain *full* of cutting-edge tech worth *billions* just exploded."" He had said, in an attempt to justify the action. Honestly, neither Father Gabriel nor I felt the need to justify it after today.

Instead of going back to Heaven, Erik took us to a cave, tucked deep into a ravine between two mountains. A sign outside of it read, in hand-painted letters:

***""SALVETE AD PURGATORIUM""***

And, in smaller letters below,

""**Quod purgatur, vivet.""**

I could hear an audible sigh from Father Gabriel as we entered the cave, then his usual humor broke the tension: 

***""Well, Lucia is a prophet, confirmed.""*** 

I don't think I'll be going back to Rome. Erik has agreed to answer a *long* list of questions I have about this whole experience, but let's save that for another day- it's well into the witching hour here, and I'm sure we could all use some rest.

Until next time,

1oj4rjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/inclusivetarot/comments/1oj4rjr/an_ancient_cheat_sheet_for_the_minor_arcana_from/,An ancient cheat sheet for the minor arcana from ace to ten,"Hello. I hope this will change your practice for good, as this is the kind of material I wished I knew when I started reading tarot – before giving myself hours and hours of nonsensical answers, due to lame (non)systems of interpretation.

  


A bit of history: these are the meanings Etteilla - let’s say, the father of writing on cartomancy - gave to tarot cards from ace to ten of every suite in the second half of 1700. As R. Decker explains in his “The Esoteric Tarot” (currently one of the works on tarot I appreciate the most) these meanings can be directly associated to the keywords that the Spanish Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla (1248-1325?) provide about the ten spheres of the Tree of Life in his kabbalistical work *Sha’are Orah*, The Doors of Light. So, if you were looking for a system of meanings which has both theoretical and temporal depth, you’ve found it. I also highly recommend to every advanced tarot student the indispensable work of Decker, of which there’s also an excellent Italian translation, my fellow spaghetti. (I’ve got the S-word, shut up.)

  


One important thing: you will notice that this system is quite concrete, “factual,” practical. If you are used to some modern system that only focuses on psychological definitions, as the actual trend goes, know that it’s easy, and also an interesting mental exercise, to translate a factual meaning into a personal concept. For example, the six of swords, defined here as travel, can easily be adapted, when doing an introspective reading, to mean adaptation of thought, mental transition, change of opinion, attunement to a change along a direction, and the like.

  


But the opposite operation – translating abstract/psychological meanings into daily facts, actions and characters – seems to bring quite disastrous results, unluckily. That’s why, if you only have a set of meanings psychologically based, sooner or later you will come here posting a spread you’re clueless about, or lamenting that “tarot doesn’t work.” I see it here on reddit every day. Thousands of smart new readers that get lost sticking to the idiocy of what they find on their teletubbies tarot deck booklet, or, even worse, to the crap of that single author that one morning woke up without coffee and created their meanings by themselves, without art nor brain, nor a good sight for cards’ figures, it looks like.

  


Now, guys, seriously. You are brilliant. You have potential. And you have a super cool attitude. But, if you exchange that third hidden person in your cards for “your lover’s inner issues,” or your querent’s wild addiction to substances for a healthy sexual desire, you are just losing important bits of information, sometimes *vital* information, and it’s really a pity. So, I really hope this little input will help you to broaden your perspectives, improve your skills, and make your deck the instrument of knowledge it really is. Remember that tarot was not created in the 1970s, but six centuries ago, indeed. There are so many things out there to learn about tarot, that probably one lifetime is not enough; you will never get short of new tarot knowledge, if you seek it. Time to throw that booklet out the window and open some book.

  


Notice: this cheat sheet is part of what I call the Italian-French system, with its other variations, and it is well applicable to the Tarot de Marseille and more ancient decks, but not to RWS (expression of the English system, if you accept my nomenclature.) Hope to post soon again about courts, majors, and other slightly different versions of this system, but life is crazy, especially for cartomancers, you know. In the meanwhile, as always, I strongly suggest you to commit to memory every meaning, whatever system you may use. You don’t really know something if you cannot promptly retrieve it.

We dated for six years and in that time, not once, did she attempt to help me with bills. Parasite is too kind of a word for her. Now that I've sobered up to her manipulations, she was without a doubt the most entitled, spoiled, manipulative leech I have ever met in my life.

It started early and I shouldn't have ignored the warning signs. I should have stuck to my guns when I tried to break up with her within the first few months, but she begged me to stay and I did. Huge mistake. She spent six years of my life like she owned them, just like she pretended to own everything else I had. Because that's all she could ever do - pretend. Pretend to be successful, pretend to be a functioning adult, pretending that she wasn't a total failure and a loser.

Her only friend was her cousin. I'm not joking. She's such a negative, black hole that not once was she invited out to a girl’s night or went out to get coffee with someone she wasn't related to. She despised the success of others. When I first bought my house she lost her shit on me because we didn't pick it out together. We weren't married and didn't have kids. We were only dating and I had all the money. She was flat fucking broke, a streak she would maintain for six years and probably will for a very very long time. I even helped pay off some credit card debt she accumulated. She got mad I wouldn't call it “our house”, then she wanted me to sell it so we could pick one out together, then she decided her career was going to be becoming a house flipper and wanted to use my first home to do that.

She told me she heard voices in the house to try to get me to move out of it. She tried to put chicken bones down the garbage disposal and got mad when I told her not to do that. She threw a fit because I wouldn't let her leave candles unattended in rooms. She wanted full wood countertops (lol) and accumulated soda cans and gas station cups in her living spaces like some kind of white trash squirrel.

Her dad was the definition of toxic masculinity, and had no chance dating any grown woman his age so he married a 21 year old. Even called her a “college kid” in front of me. Really swell guy. Her mom was cool though, despite being an alcoholic and addicted to League of Legends. Honestly looking back, I'm not surprised she turned out the way she did. 

Her daddy paid for her car until he didn’t and she got it repossessed. When she struggled to find employment, I got her a job where I worked. There, she’d spend the whole shift talking to another guy and letting him walk her to break, eating the meals I cooked and packed for us to eat as fast as she could so she could go outside to talk to him, leaving me alone in the break room. When she quit, she couldn't be an adult and tell the bosses herself, so she left it to me to do it for her. Are you seeing the trend yet?

At home she did absolutely nothing except sleep, play League and Raid: Shadow Legends and complain about absolutely everything. Looking back, she set herself up pretty good; I was paying all the bills, buying our groceries, and anytime she had a bad day I was there trying to make her feel better. So how did she fuck this all up you ask? The sex. 

The sex was ass. She wouldn't talk or touch me, no enthusiasm, and if I tried to give her feedback she'd throw a tantrum. Give her a break, it was her first time being a gold digger and she's got to learn somehow. You'd think if you were living in a nice big house, you'd at least try to fuck the brains out of the guy who was paying for your entire life but you have to remember, we ARE dealing with an idiot here. 

She threw those kind of fits often. One time she told me she wanted me to be comfortable enough to poop in front of her, and when I told her no, she said she would never sing or dance with me ever. Unhinged. When I told her I had a hard day and really could use a sweet note, she told me she couldn't find a paper and pen.

When I first got my dog she was jealous of the attention I gave him, when I was the best man at my friend's wedding and had to give a speech that night, she started a huge fight that morning to throw me off my game. She made my life miserable. Truly, in the six years I knew her, the only thing she busted her ass to improve about herself was her W/L ratio in League. 

She’d cry and hide under the blankets any time we needed to have a serious talk and when I told her I was ending the engagement (yeah I was once stupid enough to ask someone like that to marry me) suddenly all the things she couldn't possibly extend herself to help me with before, were within her reach now. 

We gave couples therapy one final shot and she had some solo sessions with the therapist, who listened to her side and told her my love was transactional 🙃 telling her I only seemed happy when she did things I wanted. I guess the correct answer was me continuing to let her sit on her ass and not help with bills.

Looking back now, it's fun to laugh at how big of a loser she was, trying to stumble through her life and how I almost torpedoed mine by getting married to someone like that.",1,1761744988.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1oj4q5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1oj4q5z/a_life_being_misunderstood/,A life being misunderstood,"Hi everyone, I’m a 36F, giftedness recognized from childhood,recently diagnosed with ADHD and trying to get assessment for probable autism spectrum. 
I’m at my wit's end trying to get competent medical attention for my sleep, as doctors keep dismissing my extreme symptoms as mere ""anxiety."" And I think that what brought to ADHD diagnosis is actually a sleep problem that makes me inattentive.
I’m reaching out to those diagnosed with Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1) for a reality check.
I have wanted a proper sleep study for 20 years, but fear of being labelled crazy , even psychiatrist when at 17 yo I told about sleep paralysis that I actually had no ideas what it was at that time, told me it was just anxiety and stress and put me under Lexotan therapy that just made me totally dissociating so I gave up . I've been fighting my day sleepiness actually all life long, total caffeine addicted and hyper vigilance, hyperactivity just all the time .all my life had big problems waking up ... I may get up somehow but the brain to wake up normally takes 3-4 hours and 2-3 coffees. I’ve finally requested a neurologist appointment, but I'm still waiting.
My Symptoms, most off all I just thought where just normal.
Extreme Daytime Sleepiness (lazy ness?)
Chronic, debilitating sleepiness that requires constant high caffeine, which only leaves me anxious and mentally clogged.
Sleep Paralysis : Chronic, from 15 you , worsened from when I was 17  bringing me to fear about going to sleep. Frequent cycles of SP from then  (bad periods I have up to 20-40 episodes per night paralysis- fake wake loop horrible painful fight to move).
I have long experienced sudden, temporary loss of muscle tone in my legs/neck when tired. Crucially, I have partial episodes (head dropping/body ceding) which are immediately countered by an involuntary muscular spasm—it's my body violently fighting to recover muscle tone and prevent total collapse. I am fully conscious during these. I thought it was just some nerves compression or tiredness so never really cared , but lately it's starting to become annoying making me fall on the floor and finding myself just crying because I feel my body doesn't cooperate. Today had been just horrible, my daughter had been trying to wake me up for more than an hour and I was just going back dreaming, when I finally got up and reach for my coffee I was so numb and crying from transition to reality (actually this is very hard for me always when it's not a spontaneous wake) after that I had different episodes in a row of losing my leg and fell two times , the others just grasped the wall to stay up , one I was little laughing when happened (the strongest) but the others where just happening without any emotional trigger. I had this for many years and never thought was anything related to sleep but when tired it worsen and today was extremely frustrating. Took me 3 coffee to start feeling like I'm almost awake and still after 5 hours from getting up I feel numb. (I'm not in a sleep deprived period, actually sleeping more than 8 hours x night so ,🥱😴😴🫩people just don't understand how I could feel like a zombie)
As a child, I had episodes of severe sleepwalking and extreme false awakenings (urinating in bed while dreaming of being in the bathroom, or found walking around the house while asleep).
When I started sleeping at school and had paralysis and I tried to share this I always got invalidated that it was my fault because I was fighting sleep at night ..no one would trust me that sleeping at night was so scary that made me fight it . Day sleep has always been easier, less paralysis, less stressful dreams..so I was sleeping in every bus , train or boring situation and just thought it was normal.
When I became mother, and I was driving so no more public transportation I just gave up day sleep and started fighting it , my hyperfocus helps so much when driving and other moments actually I realized just lately that I don't sit down, I practically stand or move or do something all the time . My giftedness and hyper awareness make me just able to prevent whatever kind of sleep attack but it is very tiring. Every like 15 days of "" normal life "" I just faint and have to sleep like 14 or more hours to just get back somehow to life.

Pharmacology & Neuro-Chemical ( I add this part maybe some of you can help me understand because doctors don't)
Awful reaction to all kind of benzodiazepine and depressions meds they tried, made me dissociating and had to give up because brought me very bad thoughts 
Noradrenergic drugs  : These drugs cause severe side effects, including aggression, acute stress, worsened my EDS, and made my sleep paralysis almost certain every time I slept.
Positive Effect of Dopaminergic Stimulants (legal and not legal ): These had the opposite, beneficial effect. They promoted wakefulness and drastically reduced or completely eliminated my sleep paralysis, allowing me to achieve better quality sleep when I chose to rest.
Curiosity Question for Diagnosed narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia Folks: This entire, messy package , Does this resonate with your diagnostic journey and make sense as a sleep disorder that mess up my nervous system?
Doctors here don't seem to grasp the connection between these symptoms. I need to find a solution, my neurodivergency is already a struggle but I think that if I get to regulate sleep I probably get better with all the rest. Need to do something I have four children and starting to get older I just don't have same energy to fight it as when I was 20.. I just hope I don't have to wait too much for neurologist to call my and get the sleep study done ... 
Sorry for writing so much but ...I just feel I may have just found a community that could understand what Im talking about... whatever comment or shared experience is greatly appreciated. Thank you!             ",1,1761744976.0,Narcolepsy,3,0.67,False

Costa Rica Travel Tip: Rent a Car or Go with a Private Driver?

This is one of the biggest questions people have before visiting Costa Rica, and honestly, both options work great — it just depends on your travel style.

If you like the freedom to explore at your own pace, pull over for fruit stands, or chase waterfalls you see on the side of the road, then renting a car is the way to go.
Most main routes — like Liberia to La Fortuna or the beaches — are easy to drive, just take your time and enjoy the scenery.

Renting a Car

Pros:

Full freedom — stop where you want, explore small towns, and follow your own rhythm.

Great for families or those who like to explore on their own.

Roads to popular areas like La Fortuna, Tamarindo, and Manuel Antonio are generally good.

Cons:

Gas is pricey, and so are automatic cars.

Insurance can be confusing — what looks cheap online can double at the counter.

Mountain or rural roads (like Monteverde or Tortuguero access routes) can get tricky, especially in rainy season.

You’ll need to be comfortable driving in unfamiliar conditions — locals drive fast, and GPS isn’t always accurate.

Tips:

Book directly with a trusted agency (avoid the $5/day deals that explode at pickup).

A 4x4 SUV is worth it, even for comfort alone.

If your credit card covers insurance, bring printed proof.

Plan parking in beach towns — some have attendants, others are pay lots.

If you’d rather skip the stress of driving, private transfers are a dream.
You just sit back while someone who knows every curve of the road takes you where you need to go. It’s great if you’re traveling with kids or just want to relax on vacation. Most drivers are super friendly, happy to stop for coffee, photos, or a local lunch along the way.

Private transfers cost a bit more, but for short trips or families, it often balances out. Plus, you get that local touch — they’ll tell you about the towns you’re passing or stop somewhere you’d never find on your own.

Private Transfers

Pros:

No stress — just sit back and enjoy the scenery.

Safer for long drives or if you’re arriving tired from the flight.

Local drivers know where to stop for great views, coffee, and bathroom breaks.

Perfect if you’re moving between 2–3 main areas and don’t plan to explore daily.

Cons:

Slightly pricier than renting if you move around a lot.

Less flexibility for spontaneous side trips.

Tips:

Ask for bilingual drivers — it makes a difference for info and recommendations.

You can often arrange custom day trips with your driver instead of booking full tours.

For groups or families, a private van often ends up cheaper than multiple shuttles.

A lot of travelers even mix it up: use private transfers at the start when you’re tired from flying, then rent a car later for exploring the beach towns.

If you want help arranging either option, greentourscr.com is a solid local company — they can set up private transfers or help you rent through Alamo with perks like a lower deposit and a free extra driver.

Here's the brutal lesson.,"I was 23, fresh out of uni, and thought I had it all figured out. My big idea? A subscription box service tailored for university students, packed with study snacks, cool stationery, and stress-relief gadgets. In my head, I was already the next startup genius. I pictured students eagerly awaiting their monthly box, my logo plastered all over campus. The dream was so vivid I could almost taste it.

So I dove in headfirst. My tiny apartment became a warehouse, with towers of cardboard boxes threatening to swallow my sofa. I spent every waking hour fueled by instant noodles and cheap coffee, designing a website, wrestling with payment processors, and trying to negotiate with suppliers who clearly knew I was a total newbie. The first month, I got 30 subscribers, mostly friends and family, but hey, it was a start! Seeing those first orders come in felt like pure magic.

But the magic faded fast. The logistics were a nightmare. One month, the snacks were stale; the next, the gadgets were stuck in shipping for weeks. My costs were way higher than I projected, and my marketing 'strategy' (aka posting on Instagram) was getting zero traction. The worst part was the churn. For every new subscriber I managed to get, two would cancel. That little 'subscription cancelled' email notification became a gut punch that started to feel personal.

After six months, I was broke and burned out. The cardboard box towers were gone, but so was all my savings. Shutting down the website and emailing my handful of remaining customers was one of the most humbling things I've ever had to do. I felt like a complete failure. It wasn't just a business that died; a piece of my ego definitely died with it. The silence in my apartment after it was all over was deafening.

The brutal lesson? I wasn't actually passionate about subscription boxes. I was passionate about the *idea* of being an entrepreneur. I was trying to solve a problem I *thought* students had, not one they were actually desperate to pay for. I learned more in those six months of failure than in four years of business school.

I’m on my way to NYC for my one month post-op appointment.  The fog in the valleys is burning away under an intense  morning sun while the air is still a chill 28°. Passenger princess time for me. 

How am I doing? I’m through the worst of the painful part of recovery.  I’m am still tender, swollen, and sore, but this has gone from a 10 right after surgery to more of a 2-3 on the subjective scale in my head. When pain/soreness hits a 4 I remember I haven’t taken Tylenol in a while.  This is where I want to be in recovery. 

I’m doing well, it’s still all new, and there are more milestones ahead for my recovery. I don’t go back to work until January and every minute of this time away from work is dedicated to being me.  Dilating 3 times a day is strangely all consuming. But it’s also dedicated time to focusing on me, putting on music and getting cozy on my bed. 

Not today though, got up early to dilate and was out the door by 7

You can host or join meetups (its free, literally takes 2 mins to create or join), see who’s attending, and connect safely without dropping your number to randoms.

Anonymity is great when you’re sharing thoughts online, but not when you’re meeting people in person. AroundU helps you find genuine folks nearby, and actually do things together.

We have a good audience in Bangalore, but would be glad if you guys create on our platform and add links in the sub, support a bootstrapped founder please. You can create either a free or a paid event.  
There are no charges at all for free events and just the pg charges for the paid ones.  
Everything is so transparent, no more things like 'Last spot left', see who is coming, what's the vibe like.

I created this because I genuinely went to these meetups a lot and half the time got ghosted or got added into spam groups. Please give us a shot, would be grateful if you can spread the word along. Thanks for reading, I appreciate your time.

* Fabric and paper wrapping - I have used scarves, pillowcases, Trader Joes paper bags, and newspaper to wrap presents. We have also started saving many of the holiday gift bags year after year to reuse over and over - HUGE MONEY SAVER
* Focusing on consumables - choosing gifts that people will actually finish and enjoy. Coffee, tea, candles, bubble bath, etc.
* Experiences - The last few years we have gotten family members tickets to concerts, sporting events, festivals, etc. for us to keep the celebration going throughout the year. This is a more expensive option for sure.
* Second hand decor - The amount of holiday decor at second hand shops, Facebook Marketplace and free Buy-Nothing groups is WILD. All our decorations were free or bought second hand and we now have A LOT.

 3 to 5 hours a day on court for decades. squatting, lunging, twisting. add a few too many backhands and my right elbow feels like sandpaper. both knees crunch when i walk stairs.

the usual stuff helped for a while. ice, physio, braces, anti-inflammatories. nothing lasted. i kept putting off injections because i just wasn’t ready to start that cycle yet.

a few months ago my physioy mentioned red light therapy. said he’d seen some studies about tissue repair and inflammation. i laughed at first. i’d seen those glowing masks on instagram and thought it was another wellness trend. but i trust him, so i started reading.

found some research showing red and near infrared light can help blood flow and recovery. figured, whatever, i’ll try it before letting someone stick a needle in my knee.

i didn’t want a giant wall panel so i got a smaller one, the lite 300 from a company called nuvibody. about the size of a laptop. i keep it on my coffee table.

started using it every morning with coffee. 10 minutes per knee, then 10 on the elbow. just sitting there while the light glows red and the world wakes up outside.

**week 1-2:** no difference. maybe a little warmth in the joints after each session, but i thought that was placebo.

**week 3:** something subtle shifted. i noticed i could go down stairs without that deep grinding click in my right knee. it still clicked, just not as sharp. the elbow wasn’t as angry after long coaching days either.

**week 4:** post-session stiffness faded faster. before, i’d get up from sitting and need a minute to loosen up. now it’s seconds. my elbow pain dropped maybe 30 percent. enough that i noticed mid-match i wasn’t automatically adjusting my swing to protect it.

then came a rough patch. **week 5:** pain flared again, probably from overdoing it at a weekend tournament. i was ready to give up. figured it was just another thing that kind of works until it doesn’t.

but i kept going. partly out of stubbornness, partly because those 20 quiet minutes in the morning had become peaceful.

**week 6-8:** something changed. the light sessions stopped being a chore. they became this calm ritual. the knee pain never disappeared, but the heaviness around it did. mornings hurt less. recovery after long coaching days got faster.

one morning i realized i’d walked down to the courts without my knee sleeve. it hit me halfway through the warm up. i forgot it. and my knee was fine. not perfect, but fine.

that was my wow moment.  
 not fireworks, just quiet surprise that my body wasn’t screaming at me for once.

i still have osteoarthritis. i still ice my knees, stretch, take breaks. but now i start my days with light, coffee, and a bit of silence.

1oj4ctg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfulMagicCommunity/comments/1oj4ctg/ritual_prayer_and_selfreflection_are_all_the_same/,"🍋 Ritual, Prayer, and Self-Reflection Are All the Same Energy","Hey everyone,
I wanted to share a little realization that’s been helping me (and might help someone just starting out).

We tend to think “ritual” means something big and complicated all the candles, smoke, chants, and perfect setup. But truthfully, ritual, prayer, and self-reflection all live in the same energy.

It’s all about taking a moment to consciously connect aligning your mind, body, and spirit. When you do that regularly, you start learning your own energy. And once you know your energy, everything else like intuition, psychic abilities, grounding all starts to flow more naturally.

🕯️ When you pray, you speak to Spirit (or God, Source, your ancestors, whoever you feel called to).
💭 When you self-reflect, you speak to yourself.
🌿 When you create ritual, you bridge the two, your energy meeting the Divine halfway.

To me, it’s like spending time with Spirit as your best friend: to vent, show gratitude, and reflect. You always walk away lighter and more aware.

This morning I made something super simple. Lemon water and turned it into a grounding ritual. While slicing the lemon, I called in Papa La Bas to open my path, Goddess Isis for healing, and my Higher Power for balance. Then I took a deep breath and sipped slowly.
No candles, no pressure, just me being present.

✨ Ritual doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s about intention, not presentation. ✨

If you’re new to your path, start small:
	•	Your morning coffee can be a focus ritual.
	•	Your shower can be a cleansing, ask Spirit to wash away heavy energy.
	•	Writing in your journal can be a spell of reflection.

Every small act can be sacred if you bring awareness to it.
That’s how you build your connection and begin to see your everyday life as the magic it already is. 🍋🌿

Ever notice how some scents feel fresh and airy, while others are deep and spicy?  
That’s because perfumes belong to different **fragrance families** — each with its own vibe.

Here’s a quick cheat-sheet 👇

🌸 **Floral** — rose, jasmine, lily, powdery, romantic  
🍋 **Fresh/Citrus** — lemon, bergamot, green tea, clean & uplifting  
🌊 **Aquatic/Marine** — oceanic, salty, breezy, great for summer  
🌲 **Woody** — cedar, sandalwood, earthy, masculine elegance  
🔥 **Oriental/Amber/Spicy** — spices, warm amber, incense, rich & bold  
🍦 **Gourmand** — vanilla, chocolate, coffee, sweet & edible vibes

Each family gives a completely different personality.

Here are a few tips I have learned over the years to reduce waste and save money during the holidays: 

* Fabric and paper wrapping - I have used scarves, pillowcases, Trader Joes paper bags, and newspaper to wrap presents. We have also started saving many of the holiday gift bags year after year to reuse over and over - HUGE MONEY SAVER
* Focusing on consumables - choosing gifts that people will actually finish and enjoy. Coffee, tea, candles, bubble bath, etc. 
* Experiences - The last few years we have gotten family members tickets to concerts, sporting events, festivals, etc. for us to keep the celebration going throughout the year. This is a more expensive option for sure. 
* Second hand decor - The amount of holiday decor at second hand shops, Facebook Marketplace and free Buy-Nothing groups is WILD. All our decorations were free or bought second hand and we now have A LOT.

1oj489c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1oj489c/an_open_letter_to_the_one_who_stayed/,An Open Letter to the One Who Stayed,"Hi.

I'm not exactly sure why I'm writing this tonight.

But today, I sat across from one of my student counselees. She was talking about a friend who had been there for her during the hardest time in her life. Someone who reminded her that she mattered, that she wasn't alone, even when she couldn't see that for herself.

And somehow, as I was nodding and holding space for her, I found myself thinking of you.

I think there's always been a part of me that believes I owe you an apology.
And maybe even more than that - a thank you.

Funny how time works. It's been what? 7? 8 years? And truthfully, we're probably no more familiar to each other now than two strangers passing on the street.

But you were never just anyone to me.

You were one of the few people I trusted with the truest parts of myself.
You came into my life when I didn’t even want to be in it.

I've known you since 8th grade.
You didn't really know me until 9th.
Still from that point, I knew you were one of the good ones.

The steady ones
.
The kind ones.

I had a fun little crush on you back then…
Quiet and shy and tucked somewhere in between poems and love letters
and even glances across the room.

But it wasn’t our time.

And little did we know… it would never be our time.

Not really.

Not in the way I once hoped.

But that didn’t make what we had any less real. Or less meaningful.

Some people don’t need to stay forever to leave something lasting.

And you did.

You always will.

Years passed. And then, life gave us another chance.
We reconnected. And we tried.
We tried so hard.

And I tried... for you.

I tried to show up. I tried to be enough.
I wanted to be the kind of person you deserved.
I wanted to be someone whole.

But I wasn't okay.

Not then.

I was in a kind of darkness I wouldn't wish on anyone.

Severely depressed. Anxious. Constantly locking myself inside the university bathroom stalls.

Dissociating. Losing chunks of time, walking around like I was outside of my own life.

Some days I'd look at the sky and wonder if it would be easier to just... stop.

There were nights where I would fall asleep wondering if I'd even care to wake up.

And somehow, in all that, you stayed.

You showed up.
You supported me.
You said you'd wait.
You told me I could get through it.
That I didn’t have to do it alone.
That we’ll get help.

At one point, it truly felt like you were the only good thing in my life.
And I wanted to keep that goodness for as long as I could.

But the more I clung to it... the more I clung to you... the more I realized how unfair it was.

You didn’t deserve to carry someone else’s brokenness on top of your own.

So I did the hardest thing I could.
I let you go.

Not because I didn’t care.
But because I cared too much.

You were the best thing I had.
You were my best friend.
And I felt like I had to protect you from the wreckage that I had become.

I told you that I wasn't even sure if I wanted to get better.

And that was the truth back then.

I was tired. Lost. Hopeless.

I don't remember much from those days.
My brain was a fog I couldn't clear.

But I remember you.

I remember the walks down the Blue Mountain.
God, I hated walking but it was the only time we got to spend some time together.

I remember the way you'd scold me for drinking too much coffee.

The late-night calls where I'd start to doze off and you'd let me rest.

You called me Panda because I was always sleepy and could fall asleep anywhere.

I remember the books you lent me. Anna and the French Kiss is still one of my faves.

You were patient when I didn't know how to speak.
You were gentle when I didn't know how to ask for help.

You were the first person I ever told about my dream of opening a coffee shop. You told me I could do it before I ever believed it myself.
I haven't done it yet. But who knows. Maybe someday.

I even remember that last time we saw each other.

An empty classroom on the 6th floor of my building.

It was my breaking point.
I lost hope altogether in front of you.

That's when I decided to push you away... but you didn’t run.

You saved me.
Not metaphorically... literally.

You were the one who could pull me back when I started to spiral.
You’d say something ridiculous just to make me laugh.
Something small, something stupid.
Even if laughing felt like a foreign language in my mouth.

You gave me something to hold onto.

I wrote for you back then.
You inspired words out of me I didn’t know I had.

Poems, letters poured out of me endlessly.

There was a time I thought I wouldn't be able to write again if I didn’t have you.

Because you were the one good thing.
My muse. My safe space.

But I write again now.

It was a lot of hard work, but I eventually found my way back to myself.
Back to silver linings in ordinary days.
Back to my voice.

I still write about love and life and pain but my poems aren’t as dark anymore.
There’s light in them now.
And you're still in there, somewhere.
Not as a wound.
But as a warm, quiet memory.

You were part of the reason I made it through.

Oh! I also became a counselor.

Wild, isn't it?

I used to think I was the last person who should be guiding anyone.
But I chose this path because I wanted to be the person I wish I had when I was barely holding on.

I sit across from young people now, and I see myself in them.

And I stay.

Because you once stayed for me.

And I'm not saying all these to make anything weird.
Or to reopen something we’ve long left behind.

I'm saying it because you deserve to hear it.

Thank you.

Thank you for loving me when I didn’t know how to love myself.

Thank you for staying.

Thank you for being a light.

I carry you with me.
In the poems. In the stories.
In the way I show up for others.
In the way I stay.

This is my long-overdue letter.
Not to fix anything.
Not to change the past.
Just to say: Thank you.

Through the years...
I've lived.
I've loved.
I've gotten my heart broken.
I've loved again.
And I've learned so much.

I don’t regret loving anymore.
I don’t regret being soft. Or kind.

Yes, things can change.
Yes, people leave.
But I don’t want to have regrets.
Not when love is still one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever experienced, even if it sometimes hurts.

I live now.

I don’t wake up every morning searching for all the reasons not to exist.

I go to a job I love.

I don't drink as much coffee as before, but I still like it strong and sweet.

I spend time with people who make me laugh.

I made peace with my family.

I fill my days with meaning. With color.

I'm here.

I made it.

And if I haven’t said it before; I’m sorry.

I’m sorry for the hurt I caused.

For pushing you away when all you wanted to do was stay.

For the confusion, for the silence, for the weight I placed on your heart when I was still trying to carry my own.

Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing by letting you go.
But that doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt you.
And for that, I carry a quiet ache.

You didn’t deserve the way things ended.
You didn’t deserve to love someone who didn’t have the capacity to receive it fully.

I was in survival mode.

You didn’t fail me.
I just wasn’t ready to be loved the way you loved me.

And if someone asked me if I'd do it all over again?

Probably, yes.

As much as it hurt.

As sad as it ended.

But now, I've made peace with it.
Because I think that heartbreak was the turning point.

The start of everything I needed to become.

Just like the last time we spoke, I still carry that same wish for you.

I hope you found someone who truly sees you for who you are.
The quiet strength, the depth, the heart that shows up even when it's hard.

Someone who loves you as much as you love them.

Because knowing you… you love hard.

You're all in.

And that kind of love deserves to be returned, fully, faithfully.

I hope you have all the good things.
The kind of peace that feels like home.
The kind of laughter that feels like healing.

I hope you're achieving the dreams you once told me about. Or maybe chasing new ones. Bigger, braver ones.

I hope life’s been kind to you.
But more than that, I hope you’ve been kind to yourself.

Because if anyone deserves goodness, it's you.

So wherever you are…
I hope you're happy.
I hope you found someone who gives you what you always gave so freely.
I hope you take her to the moon for me.
I hope you are loved. Deeply. Gently.
Because you were always the easiest person to love.

Take care.
I'll carry the memory of your kindness with me, always.

With all the gratitude I never had the chance to say out loud but always carried in my heart,


A

""Save 70% of your income, cut out coffee, eat rice and beans, retire in 2 years.""

Here’s the truth: personal finance isn’t one-size-fits-all. None of those systems work unless you make them work for you.

I just dropped a blog post about the idea that intentionality is the real key to financial success.  
It’s not about following someone else’s budget template, or obsessing over every dollar, it’s about understanding your relationship with money, asking what actually matters to you, and then spending/saving with ***intention***.

You can use 50/30/20, zero-based, envelope, or no budget at all (it doesn’t matter). The only rule is that you are ***intentional***.  
Buy the damn coffee guilt free if it fits your goals..

1oj45uq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oj45uq,Atelier Matcha Class Review,"I was lucky enough to catch one of Atelier's monthly matcha-making class, and it was absolutely worth it!

I'm still new to the world of matcha, and learning to make it myself at home, though I've been a fan of matcha cafes ever since a friend introduced me to matcha tiramisu and other matcha dessert. I learned about the overseas boom of people making matcha at home, and I'm obsessed, so I wanted to take a lesson from a professional.

Atelier (Ginza) hold several types of classes (whisking/latte making, tasting koichas, grinding and making your own matcha, etc) which they post about on their Instagram, and you email them to reserve a slot. I believe they will also do private lessons for groups of 2 or more.

*Note:* It seems their email isn't on their website, so you may have to go directly to their Instagram to find it.

I signed up for the matcha making class that teaches you how to properly whisk usucha by hand, by electric chasen, taste two types of matcha, and make your own latte/iced usucha. 

The lesson was 90 minutes and cost 5500JPY.

Normally, there are 4 slots per class, but the others all cancelled, so I got an extra special lesson all to myself. The lesson was conducted in Japanese, but they do offer bilingual support if you need it, and the materials provided can be in English or Japanese.

My sensei was the owner of Atelier herself, a woman who has been practiscing the art of tea ceremony for 20 years, and made a perfectly foamy usucha in just a few seconds.

She started with an explanation of the different types of tea in Japan, what matcha is and how it's grown, and had a small stone mill to demonstrate how to make matcha. She put some tencha inside for me to try, and it was even heavier than I thought! I can't imagine doing this for a full hour for just 2 grams of matcha (apparently this is another of their classes).

She mentioned that tencha by itself could even be eaten and I got to taste it. It's quite nice, like seaweed.

After that, she went through the different types of matcha, from lower quality, to commercial, to organic, to higher grade. The difference in color was really obvious.

Then, it was time to start whisking the first usucha by hand. We started with Matsukaze, the lower of the two higher grades. The tools needed were: a sieve, a digital scales, a kettle, a chasen, a chawan.

Sensei demonstrated by whisking the perfectly foamy usucha in just seconds. She said ideally an usucha shouldn't take more than 30 secs at most, and her tea ceremony school prefer a foamy type, but there's other types too.

I understand that a lot of people here are already very familiar with how to whisk matcha, but I'm going to mention the key points she made, since they were helpful for me.

**Whisking usucha by hand**

Start by heating the water to bloom the whisk and heat up the chawan with some hot water, then pour out and dry.

Always measure and sift the matcha, preferably right before you make it for the best results. She was very adamant about sifting to avoid clumps, since clumps are a waste of matcha. Then hold the whisk with four fingers, use one hand to support the chawan, and whisk rapidly back and forth for 20\~30 secs.

She also mentioned the importance of a chasen stand, as it can help even a damaged chawan restore its shape. She also mentioned it's important to replace older chasen regularly to avoid breakage, but understands it's difficult to purchase chasens from abroad.

We used Matsukaze and it was bitter, but light and refreshing. Sensei gave me a beautiful wagashi to eat with it, and the sweetness complemented the tea beautifully.

**Whisking usucha by automatic whisk**

This time, the chasen is attached to a machine. Since the rapid spinning would damage the chawan, we used a jug to whisk. And since a jug retains heat, there was no need to preheat with hot water. First, manually mix the matcha and water together so all the powder dissolves, then press the button to turn on the appliance and whisk until you reach your desired foam. This way was sooo easy and even I got a perfect finish. They use these electric whisks at the cafe, so anyone can make a perfect matcha, even with less experience. Even sensei uses her electric whisk every morning to make her usucha, because it's so convenient.

While Atelier itself didn't invent the electric chasen, the owner redesigned their own specific version, along with a stand. I believe it can be purchased online, though I'm not sure where, sorry! Price was upwards of 10,000\~ so I think I'll stick to whisking by hand, even though it was sooo easy.

We used Ogurayama this time, and it was noticeably a lot sweeter than Matsukaze. Sensei offered some chocolates and little melt in your mouth candies with it.

**Matcha Latte**

This was the main attraction for me - I really wanted Atelier's recipe! Sensei said she has no problem sharing it with anyone who emails, so I believe it's fine to share here too.

I got to choose which matcha I wanted to use, and I went with Ogurayama, as it's sweeter.

We used the electric chasen and jug method again. Atelier uses 4g of matcha in their latte, which sensei admits is quite a lot (and YK have scolded them for using too much lol) but she feels they taste best that way. Since 4g is a lot to sift at once, she advised to sift 2g at a time. Also, matcha for latte takes longer to whisk (40\~60 sec) because more matcha is used.

*Recipe:*

Matcha 4g

Room Temp Water 50g

Ice 90g

Milk\* 150g

Gum syrup\*\* 10g

\*I don't know what regular milk they use, but according to their Instagram, they use Oatside Barista Blend for the oat milk.

\*\*Maple syrup can also be used. Honey can too, but only syrup will make the layers.

We added ice to a glass first, then milk, then gum syrup and mix together. This is the key to creating the beautiful layer effect. Make sure to pour the matcha mixture directly onto the ice.

I used their recipe to recreate their latte at home and even with my non-famous brand (but still decent quality Japanese matcha), it tastes really similar! I think I prefer my latte a little smaller, so I'm going to try and reduce the amount of everything, but if you want to recreate their latte, this recipe is pretty much what you get at the cafe, just adjust amount of sweetness to taste.

The rest I'll put under misc thoughts.

**Matcha Storage**

Ideally, tins should be stored in the fridge in a ziplock bag to prevent any scent transfer and taken out 1 hour beforehand, but if consumed daily, stored in a cool, dark place works too. Sensei advised using coffee storage containers to keep air out.

**Matsukaze vs Ogurayama**

Sensei mentioned that when people try both of these teas as usucha, there's normally a 50/50 split over which they prefer. Matsukaze is more bitter, so for a lot of people, it's the ""grassy, matcha taste"" that people associate with the tea. But Ogurayama is sweeter, which is more pleasing to some people. It really depends on if you like bitter matcha or not.

I also asked which was better for latte, but she said she'd personally recommend both, it just depends on which taste profile you prefer.

Atelier currently offer Ogurayama as a latte, which I recommend if you like your lattes sweet and creamy, and want to taste Yamamasa Koyamaen.

They used to offer Matsukaze and Tennouzan too, but they're currently discontinued, and instead they offer Samidori, which I haven't tried, but I will at some point.

**Other Recommendations**

Sensei likes Ippodo Ikuyo and recommended that or Wakaki for latte.

Maybe not a recommendation, but she showed me the very expensive Tsujiri (20g for 20,000¥) she recently obtained. Apparently it might not taste quite as good as you'd imagine something that expensive to taste, unless you're an experienced matcha drinker, the way expensive fine wine is an acquired taste. So basically, it really should be reserved for only people who really appreciate the finer nuances of matcha. Especially since it costs 4000JPY for one koicha.

**Would I recommend this experience?**

Absolutely, 100%! I loved every minute of it and learned so much, and it's an awesome opportunity to try both Matsukaze and Ogurayama in one sitting.

First of all I want to mention that I was a long time Duolingo user and I finished the entire Spanish course. I'm not fluent in Spanish but thanks to Duolingo I understand high level grammar and communicate with my Spanish friend. So in this aspect Duolingo has helped me learn Spanish. Now I want to learn German, but after the updates, new features and everything that made Duolingo go worse, I broke my streak and left the German course somewhere in the beginning of it. 

After a big break, I decided to turn back to learn German. I downloaded Coffee Break German podcast and I listen to it on my daily commute to college, and I take some notes, but I'm afraid it might not be enough. 

I decided that maybe I could go back to learning on Duolingo despite everything, but the app is now unusable on free version and the prices have gone up so much that I thought it probably isn't worth it. Yet I still want  you guys' opinion about it. Is there an alternative that can help me learn German without needing to do much work on my own? (Because without something to put me on my way of learning a language, I find it hard to where to start from and what to learn in the correct order.) Just like Duolingo, for example. While learning Spanish my daily study plan was to practice on Duolingo for 2 hours and that was it. After a few months I have made so much progress already. I know Duolingo German course isn't as good as the Spanish and French courses but for German my plan is to get to a decent level of understanding (about B1 for example) and then continue my learning by listening to podcasts and so on. 

So my questions are, how can I learn German, would you guys still recommend Duolingo (this is the main question), if not, which platform(s) should I use, if I should buy a paid course which one would you guys recommend?

The reason I'm posting this on this subreddit is to get your ideas about turning back to Duolingo. However, if you have any other recommendations for me please share them, I would be very pleased. ",2,1761743246.0,duolingo,3,1.0,False

She did horrible things to me and I still am not over it. What I tell you here is just a small thing, not even close to the worst thing she did to me. And I know she will never be punished for the things she did to me. But ...

When I was about 14 my first schizophrenia symptoms showed up. I was too afraid to talk to my mother about it, because she never believed anything I said about my mental health. ""Properly raised kids don't have mental problems and you were raised proplery"" was her typical answer. So I talked about it with a social worker at school and she convinced me to seek professional help, starting by talking to my pediatrician.

I went to her to get info about psychotherapy and whatnot, but she just said to me she couldn't talk to me about that without my mother present. I pleaded her not to tell my mother and just forget the conversation. The doctor did not. And when the pediatrician reached my mother to tell her what I said, she went apeshit one me, through a mug with hot coffee at me and called me a liar and worse.

Years later (I was in ym 20'S and still had contact to her, I don't know why) it was once again time to tell the story from her perspective to her boyfriend's family, people I barely knew. She asked me if I remembered the time when I told lies about seeing and hearing things just to get attention. Normally I would have just let it slide, nod and be done with it. But I just got my diagnosis.

Instead of saying that, I just reminded her of the nasty habit back in the day to run into my and fart whenever she had a man overm because she didn't want to fart in front of the guy. Didn't matter if I had friends over or not. She came in, farted loud and went out, the smell lingering in my room. And one time, she shat herself, dripping wet, right in front of three of my friends.

As I told my story in front of her new boyfriend and his family, she denied it, but her face was as red as a tomato and she almost cried. Then her new boyfriend said ""Yeah, that's kinda disgusting. I mean, I still can hear you in the living room."" That moment something in her must have died, because the next time I saw her she apologized and never talked about me ""lying"" again. It was just a small victory and no reparation for years of abuse, but it felt good and still makes me smile to this day.

1oj3wsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychicthis/comments/1oj3wsg/the_psychic_field_without_the_fear_redefining/,"The Psychic Field (Without the Fear): Redefining Intuition as Clarity, Not Mystery or Creepiness","***Forget haunted vibes and floating candles - this is what the psychic field really is: perception, connection, and the quiet magic of knowing.***

The word *psychic* has been hijacked by fear, superstition and Hollywood effects. In truth, psychic skills and the psychic field aren’t spooky at all – the skills are the natural awareness that allows us to navigate the psychic field with more clarity. In this post, we’ll de-spookify intuition and “the spiritual world” and return them to their rightful place: calm, connection, and clarity.

I’m frequently asked when I realized I was psychic. My standard answer is that somewhere in my early twenties it came to my attention that not everyone sees images or just *knows* things. Huh.

But I’ve always been fascinated by the so-called “paranormal.” I went to workshops and lectures, tried on a lot of different disciplines - most of them orbiting the New Age sun - but none of them ever answered all of my questions. The Berkeley Psychic Institute came closest. Their philosophy was simple: have a question? Look at the energy of it. What do you see?

That appealed to me. I’ve always been one to blaze my own trail.

These days, I have a much clearer understanding of the psychic field - and it’s everything people think it is, but also, not at all what people think it is.

*Cue the horror movie soundtrack complete with floating objects -* because apparently, intuition needs special effects to sell?

Let’s strip that away for a moment.

The psychic field isn’t a haunted mansion filled with hidden forces. It’s the invisible weave of perception, connection, and possibility that underlies everything. It’s not “out there,” it’s *right here -* and you’re already participating in it, whether you realize it or not.

# Perception

Imagine you’re sitting in a coffee shop, deeply absorbed in a quiet drama unfolding across the room. You don’t hear your friend calling your name. Your attention is tuned outward. That’s how most of us move through life - so focused on what’s external that we miss what’s quietly speaking from within.

Psychic perception isn’t about conjuring spirits or crossing dimensions - it’s about turning your attention inward long enough to hear the subtle currents of knowing that have always been running through you.

# Connection

Everything – *everything -* is made of energy. From the lightest, most ethereal spark of a thought to the densest form of matter: heavy metals, boulders, bone - it’s all vibrating on a continuum. The psychic field holds all of it; your attention is the part of you that becomes aware of this living network.

When you tune into that field, you realize you’re not an isolated observer. You’re part of the fabric. The conversation is already happening - you just become conscious of your side of it.

# Possibility

And that’s where the magic opens up. The more you perceive, the more you see that reality isn’t fixed; it’s responsive. Choices appear. Intuition leads. You stop trying to force things and begin to collaborate with them.

There’s no fear in that - only freedom.

Because despite all the scary stories, the psychic field isn’t dangerous. It doesn’t belong to “gifted” people, and it’s not a moral obstacle course. It’s awareness.

The only thing you’re likely to become possessed by is a sudden sense of clarity.

# Reframing the “Veil”

Intuition is the natural operating system of consciousness. The only reason it feels hidden is because of the density of this reality. The physical world moves more slowly - its particles are thick, its pace deliberate. That density acts like a veil, not to punish or block us, but to give us contrast.

Here, in this slower medium, intuition has to be *chosen*. We get to practice remembering what we already know because the psychic field isn’t out there - *it’s right here*.

When we stop dramatizing the psychic field, it becomes what it’s meant to be: a quiet, trustworthy knowing that steadies us in a noisy world.

I asked this last week, and I’ll ask it again: ***What’s one area of your life where you could use intuition instead of fear?***

\*\*\*\*\*

**Next week:** ***Choosing Your Ride***

We’ve stripped away the fear, the superstition, and the spooky effects. Now it’s time to choose your ride. Are you clinging to the rollercoaster’s edge, or settling into the flow with clarity and courage?  
Because there are no monsters under the bed - only momentum, and you get to steer. The choice has always been yours.

No crystal ball required. Just clear seeing, honest insight, and a touch of magic. [Book your session here.](https://koalendar.com/e/meet-with-dawn-wirt)

1oj3wfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/1oj3wfw/first_time_on_snap_due_to_unemployment_thoughts/,First time on SNAP due to unemployment..... thoughts about covering  not covering supplements...,"I was fired on September 5th (after 22+ years) and managed to get on SNAP. I received my card, and it was only $80. I’ve used the nearby food bank before, so I’m not starving, honestly. With that first $80, I decided to stock up on pantry staples like olive oil, some spices, and other basics. I had planned to do the same with my next $80.

In addition to that, our main fridge died almost a year ago, and we’ve been getting by with one mini freezer and two mini fridges. They’re quirky, unreliable, and sometimes a hassle, but I’m still grateful to have them. Honestly, it’s been one thing breaking after another, which makes it really hard to catch up or save for anything new.

Anyway, I was watching a video recently on brain supplements. I have ADHD and some cognitive issues (I’m 57), and I also have diabetes, so I have to be careful about what I eat and how I eat. I use a few supplements: curcumin, vitamins D3 and B’s, and in my coffee I add coconut oil, acacia fiber, and collagen protein. These help me manage my blood sugar, mood, and overall brain health. They’re not “fancy luxuries.” They’re essential for keeping me functional and clear-headed.

But SNAP doesn’t allow supplements. No vitamins, no fiber, no collagen. Yet you can buy all the sugary junk you want. I know it’s a controversial topic, but it’s endlessly frustrating for those of us who actually try to eat well and stay healthy. I’m pretty conscientious about food and diet, as much as I can be under the circumstances. I can cook, prep, preserve, and use whole ingredients. But between stress and job hunting (unemployment is honestly busier than working), I don’t always have time to eat properly. Some days it’s a few spoonfuls of cottage cheese or microwaved ham slices from the food pantry with melted Swiss cheese.  Also, it can be challenging to fully get all the nutritional benefits from our food and often supplements are neccessary and yet, not all supplementation is the same (some are better than others).

That supplement video I mentioned talked about DHA and EPA, nutrients found mostly in fatty fish like salmon and mackerel. I actually stocked up on a few tins of Chicken of the Sea sardines. Still, I wish SNAP allowed some of these health-supporting supplement items. Acacia fiber helps my blood sugar and gut health. Collagen supports protein intake and my hair, skin, and nails. These things make a real difference for me.

When I want something sweet, I usually go for dark chocolate (70% or higher) or cook up berries when they’re on sale. I top them with store-brand Cool Whip (dirty low carb, but it works). Pretty tasty. I’ve got a weakness for potato chips sometimes, and I like wine here and there, but that’s minimal.

I just wish more people understood the basics of cooking, nutrition, and food preservation. Our food bank was handing out cabbages like candy, so I made a couple of batches of sauerkraut. Feels good to make something from scratch again.

Not shaming, but trying to keep the conversation alive about all the current topics in our society today.  I know that everyone has their own situation and shaming doesn't help.

I don't know what the current status of the SNAP benefits for November is at?  I heard rumors of SOME kind of legislation/bill being forumulated  to finally keep it funded for the rest of the year? I know our local foodbank had lines out the door. It is just so ridiculous we are in this situation. Its FOOD!!!! everyone needs it to live!",0,1761742890.0,foodstamps,3,0.42,False

32M I grew up in SEAsia, but now living in the south of Germany (Franconia) for a graduate degree. 

Physically, I'm 178cm and 70kg (5'10, 155lbs). Relatively sporty, mostly bouldering and cycling, but also likes to eat a lot. Shoulder length dark hair, but with more and more white hair coming in 🥲

Likes:
- Music: Florence and the machine is my favourite. 
- Sports. 
- Youtube: could be gaming related or SortedFood.
- Gaming: OW2, Valorant, It Takes Two (well until the person found a bf) 
- Coffee.

Dislikes:
- Warm weather. 
- Waiting in queue. 
- DB (iykyk). 
- people that aren't willing to put in a little effort sometimes. 

The past few months have been a whirlwind for me, and I don't really have anyone to express it to. I'm also quite mentally fried, and pretty disenchanted with the idea that I'd meet ""the one"". 

So kind of giving it a last shot. Let's see what happens :) 

P.S. I'm also a ""friends first"" person. I believe that my partner should be my best friend, so I try not to rush. 

Also, I'm not really a long distance kind of person. ",0,1761742663.0,amwfdating,0,0.5,False

for those who don’t speak german, it’s a website for an organic coffee roasting company.

i’ve been trying to mix a clean, minimal structure with some rough, hand-drawn details to give it that handcrafted, authentic vibe that fits the “organic” theme. i wanted it to feel a bit human and imperfect, not overly corporate. but right now, i feel like it doesn’t blend together the way i hoped. it kind of looks like two different design styles clashing. like the rough parts are just “stuck on” instead of feeling intentional.

i’m not sure if that’s because of the layout, the typography, or maybe the spacing and proportions. i’ve tried adding some texture and contrast, but it either becomes too messy or too sterile.

also keep in mind this is still a work in progress, i know some of the spacing is off, and i’ll fix that once i’m done. the coffee cups on the homepage are there twice because i’m trying to decide between the brown and black illustrations.

any ideas on how to make it feel more cohesive? i’d love to keep that balance between modern/clean and natural/handcrafted without it looking random or unfinished.",1,1761742612.0,graphic_design,3,0.99,False

1oj3rtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/oneanddone/comments/1oj3rtf/sterilization_i_did_it_and_a_tip_for_all/,Sterilization: I did it🎊 (and a tip for all interested women around Munich),"Yesterday I (37f) had my sterilization, and I’m soooo happy I finally did it!

Already during my pregnancy with my son (\*2022), I knew he would be my first and last child.

The list of reasons was (and still is) very long:  
A traumatic pregnancy, an okay birth that ended in a C-section, breastfeeding problems that left me with bleeding nipples that were literally torn (sorry for the honesty), and the time afterward was just *intense*! That loss of freedom and autonomy was (and sometimes still is) really hard for me and my husband. We kept asking ourselves: *How does anyone voluntarily do this again?* When you don’t have kids, you imagine walking around with a baby carrier and a sleeping infant while sipping coffee from a to-go cup. Nobody really tells you what it actually means to care for a child 24/7... Well, actually, they do! Just not in the way I would have needed to really think it through. And we *did* think it through beforehand. Our child was very much wanted!

With every passing day (depending on the phase 😅), I’m more and more grateful that we had him. I would never be the person I am today without him. Having a child is truly a booster for personal growth, in my opinion. The confrontation with your own parents, your own childhood, and the reparenting you go through because of it — all that makes me deeply grateful for my child in the long run. He’s also made us much more relaxed and flexible than we ever would have been otherwise. What’s yet to come, we’ll see!

At the same time, I think one child is the sweet spot: you get all the experience and growth, but you never reach “full prison mode.” You can take turns, and sooner or later you get a lot of your freedom back — both as an individual and as a couple.

It’s only day one after the surgery, but I already feel sooo liberated! I woke up in the recovery room and literally had tears of relief, gratitude, and joy running down my cheeks. Gratitude that I have the possibility to decide for myself — about my body, my life, and my future. How many millions of women wish they had that choice!

I can only encourage everyone (men and women) who have been thinking about getting sterilized to go for it! From now on, it’ll only get easier (or so my maybe-naive hope says), and I can fully dive into this life I freely chose for myself.

**Tip for all women around Munich:**  
In Munich, sterilization (bilateral salpingectomy) costs around €2500, but at Klinikum Rosenheim, with the same level of care, it’s only about €600–700. Everyone there was super professional and friendly. I can wholeheartedly recommend it (and so can another friend who had her sterilization done there).

He has a couple of kids and is in a long term relationship but as he told me he’s suffering from a dead bedroom. 

Anyway just like the last time something like this happened to me, I instantly lost any interest I had. Not only because he’s apparently open to cheat on his partner but I also feel instantly disgusted he sees me in a sexual way. I since dread going to class everyday (we sit next to each other) and I barely want to talk to him anymore. 

I do admit I’m not used to stuff like this. Before I entered my 30s no one showed any interest in me and now it’s just people who want to cheat on their partner.

please send them Ease, Wealth. Health. Community. The energy turned slow laps through us. I asked for these concepts one at a time, letting the energy spread each of these gifts. Then I asked, ""For those who wish it, please release that which does not serve us."" I felt my sinuses clear and a tightness leave my chest. 

I asked this energy to help Mother Gaia. Please send it to her areas that are most in need. That are most unbalanced. I apologized for my trespasses upon her. I told her I was sorry that there was need for her to course correct with hurricanes. 

Then I felt a giant rush of energy overcome me. The biggest I have ever felt. Afterwards, I felt washed with a beautiful feeling of peace, of the ease I asked for. This morning I made an offering to mother Gaia. I shared my coffee with her.

We all play play with what we have that's why even if my dream team for her is to add Mika and Nia, Nia and Cassius are the only 4 stars I don't have and knowing how drawing is strong in card games and Nia with her discard mechanic would be a perfect fit for Reinoa who loves discarding bullets, that sucks. This is why I fit Reinoa with Rei and Tressa. It's an agro deck that revolves around Resonating Darkness that buffs all void cards with cost 1 (I tried to buff Lucas cards with it, it doesn't work so it's only void and yes I had to play things before fully understanding them because of lack of infos on cards and I found out that equipments only affects cars that the combattant equipped owns, not all cards in hand, it's subtle but crucial to understand it)

When playing agro there's an obvious problem which is tankyness that's why I either destroy chaos if I get good equipment, cards, and epiphany early on or I can't end the run. Now let's see in detail Tressa and Rei:

\- Tressa is nice but her core mechanic is agony. She fits perfectly in that cheap compo but I don't have an idea how to make a strong comp around her.

\- Rei is horrible except for 1 card that justify playing her, I just talked about it, it's Resonating Darkness, if it wasn't for this only card, she would be garbage. Why do I say that? While all her epiphany cards are good, Dark Blade is the worst attack card I've ever seen. 15 dmg + 120% crit chance??? Why, just why? Snack Time is a key card because drawing is important and with Yuri who let's you draw 2 cards for free I solved the drawing problem. I criticized harsly Rei but why is Yuri only 3 stars? Making an insanely strong partner so easy to get is crazy! Last not least Rei Ego Skill gives 1 AP and damage which is very good.

I start every run with this cheap team by deleting Dark Blade x2, Material Regeneration, Black Veil, and Touch of Darkness which is a lot of cards but if I don't do it fast and draw these bad cards I'll get rekt.

As you progress you need more and more Simulation rush and spend a lot of resources to promote and level up your characters. That takes a lot of time, spending Ether and cristals (coffee isn't enough). Both my Rei and Tressa are level 40 and it already took me a lot of time and resources to farm them not to mention I have to farm affinity with them with only 3 pass a day right now. If I had Nia or Cassius (Cassius is a good subsitute for Nia in my dream team and I will play him in other compositions I thought) I'd stop immediately any more farm in these 2 but unfortunately even after buying a few packs I didn't get them that's why I ask you, please, do you recommend me to keep farming them?

My dog (a wee Labrador and Lurcher mix) was patiently waiting to get in. It all happened so quickly, but through the frosted glass, I see a brown and white dog running up to my dog and, next thing I know, my dog is yelping frantically and the two dogs are tussling. 

I open the front door, expecting it to be a normal dog fight. I was thinking, I can hit this dog over the head or something and make it fuck off. But whenever I opened the door, the other dog was an XL Bully with its jaws on my dog. It was trying to go for her throat and was attempting to do something I’ve only seen alligators do in videos (death roll). 

I started screaming because I know XL Bullies are incredibly strong and ruthless. My mother and nephew were in the sitting room, shouting, “What’s going on?” I was screaming at them, “Don’t go out, don’t go out!” I ran into my kitchen and grabbed a butcher knife, then I ran out into the garden, but the XL Bully had already ran up the street. Turns out, my mother threw her hot coffee on the XL Bully. And there were children up the street- where the XL Bully had run off to. 

All the neighbours had come out and were asking, “Are you okay, what’s happened?” I couldn’t even respond, so my mother was just talking to them. 

My dog is thankfully okay. The XL Bully didn’t have much time to inflict much damage on my dog- and she’s a strong dog herself but is a family dog. All the kids come to my door and ask if they can play with her. The poor wee thing was so shaken. 

I was about to phone the dog warden (although someone told me I should’ve phoned the police- given that I believe it’s a banned breed). Then I hear a knock on the door, it’s the dog’s owner. She’s shaking and asking if my dog is okay. She was extremely apologetic. She said she was in the shower and the XL Bully escaped. She had barely anything on her but a dressing gown and slippers. She was telling me she was a bit scared of the dog herself, that she gets dragged by it when it’s on a lead, that she has grandchildren and can’t trust the dog around them anymore, and that she’s going to get rid of the dog now because of what it did to my dog. 

The weirdest part: The XL Bully knows my dog and has been very friendly with my dog whenever it’s been on a lead and with its owner. 

I told the owner that the attack was completely unprovoked. And that’s not me just trying to say that my dog is an angel- she’s a wee fucker at times- but she was genuinely just waiting at my door to get in. 

I am still in shock and horrified. It was just the fact that I was expecting it to be a normal dog, then I see it’s an XL Bully with its jaws around my dog. 

I live in an area where we have a dense population of “hard lads,” and people getting scary-looking dogs because it’s class or something. Also a lot of the sentiment, “It’s not the dog, it’s the owner.” For a bit of context, in the area I live in, we currently have wee scumbags throwing fireworks around, an over abundance of drug dealers, and wannabe gangsters. 

Listen, this lady is lovely, and I’m sure she treats her dog well, but these dogs aren’t family dogs. They’re attack dogs. They are disproportionately violent, ruthless and strong. This is what makes them a danger. 

After all of this happened, I decided to go out to the car and finally grab my headphones. As I was in my garden, I fainted, and hit the stone path, because of the extreme stress and anxiety. I wasn’t just thinking about my dog dying or being seriously injured, but also thinking it could turn on my mummy or my wee nephew. 

I was talking to a legal expert. I sent them the photographs of the injuries I had after fainting. I was telling them about how the fear caused me to faint, how I’m afraid to go out to my car now, knowing that those types of dogs are lurking around, and the fact that the attack literally happened on my front door step. They told me to phone the police on 101, report the dog (as we believe it’s a banned breed- not just me but others who also saw it) and put a claim in against the owner for physical and psychiatric damages. 

I also had to ask for legal advice because I ran outside holding a knife, which my neighbours saw. I was told that what I did was legally justified because “it was self-defence with reasonable force.”

I’m unsure of how to proceed. The owner did say she is getting rid of the dog, and she seems like a nice lady and was genuinely horrified by what happened. I think I’m going to trust her that she’s getting rid of the dog, but if I see that dog around, ever again, the police are getting phoned because there’s no way that thing should be on the streets. 

The cherry on top? The dog is only 8 months old. Only 8 months old and it’s already huge and violent. 

These dogs usually aren’t even from reputable breeders (well, they’re banned anyway so nobody should be breeding them). It’s usually from some druggie, with a stupid nickname, breeding them in his back garden. 

I hate big lad/hard lad culture. 

Big lad/hard lad culture is not unique to any community on either side. It’s a pervasive problem which seems to have permeated through the sectarian divides. 

EDIT: Am going to go through with reporting the dog and the owner to the dog warden. Will update yous whenever the dog warden gets back to me. If the dog warden won’t do anything, it will be the police I’ll report this too- because the dog is a banned breed and needs destroyed. ",56,1761741352.0,northernireland,44,0.89,False

Okay, when I say ""his stuff"", I don't mean that we cordoned off areas that the other partner isn't allowed to go through. It's more like a natural evolution that things like papers, notebooks, etc, just end up piling up in a specific area.

The reason I don't go through them is just because there is nothing I need from them. Today was different. I needed his mini screwdriver set, and I knew it was in his office somewhere. I had texted him beforehand, and he couldn't remember exactly where he had put them, so he said just look around.

So I eventually find them on his book shelf, and as I'm picking them up, I set a piece of paper sticking out from one of the note books with my name in his hand writing.

My first thought is, ""Oh, this must be something he forgot to give me. Let me take it.""

What it was, was a list of different things I had said to him over the last few months. Things like ""I love you."", ""I love the way you smell."", ""Don't go, the bed is colder without you here."". Things I just said off without thinking, he had written down and dated with estimated time.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to go through the notebook I had found this piece of paper sticking out of. Turns out the notebook was a sketchbook, and he had drawn images of me in various poses like drinking coffee on the couch while reading, sleeping, staring out the window, laughing. (when I say images of me, I mean really romantacised images of me, because I don't even look that way on a good day, and believe me I don't have many good days).

The thing is I've never seen him pick up a pencil. I didn't even know he could draw. I've never seen him draw, especially not anything of me, but there it was.

In the sketch pad were also all these loose papers. Ideas for books, games, theories on the afterlife, reflections about life, society, romance, freaking time/space relativity! Drafts for short stories. Fully composed songs, with lyrics and music. A list of things that made me happy and things that made me sad. Special notes about traumatic events I had experienced in my life so he wouldn't forget. Notes about things we did together.

It was amazing, and fascinating, and enthralling, and most of all sad.

Because I didn't know any of this about him. Despite how long we've been together, I find it difficult to get him to open. Whenever I've tried to find out anything about him, he deflects it back to me. Try to find out what he wants to do? He wants to do what I want to do. I knew nothing about this part of his life, and not from lack of trying.

It's like I found out my husband has been living a double life, and I'm seriously wishing it was with another person. Because this hurts. I don't know why it hurts but it does. Badly.

I've put all the notes and drawings back. Tidied up. And I don't know what to do. I feel like if I ask him about it, he'll try drawing back deeper into his shell. Might even stop himself from doing any of this just in case I find it again. But I don't know if I can pretend that I don't know, what I now know.

TLDR: Found out my husband isn't who I thought he was.",118,1761741137.0,relationship_advice,47,0.93,False

Your immune cells follow your body clock too. When sleep, nutrition, and recovery go out of sync, your defense system gets confused.

***Here’s what actually happens:***

* Late nights mess with your circadian rhythm — your immune cells don’t know when to rest or repair.
* Caffeine overload pushes cortisol (your stress hormone) higher, which directly suppresses immune response.
* Skipped meals mean fewer amino acids, zinc, and vitamins that your white blood cells need to function.

The result? You’re not “catching” every cold — your immune system is just underfed and overstressed.

# Small resets that work:

* Sleep before midnight (your immune hormones peak early).
* Replace one coffee with water + B-vitamin–rich foods like nuts or seeds.
* Don’t skip the first real meal of the day — your gut is where most immune cells live.

1oj37gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/elevotv/comments/1oj37gh/gemini_25_the_hidden_plastics_unpacking/,[Gemini 2.5] The Hidden Plastics: Unpacking Microplastic Exposure in Everyday Life,"In an increasingly plastic-saturated world, concerns about microplastics – tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size – are growing. These ubiquitous fragments are now being found within the human body, raising urgent questions about how they get there and what the health implications might be. Our recent conversation delved into some surprising sources of microplastic exposure, revealing just how deeply plastics have integrated into products we use daily.

# Beyond the Bottle: Unexpected Plastic in Paper Products

Many of us assume that ""paper products"" are purely natural. However, modern manufacturing often tells a different story:

* **Paper Towels & Tissues:** While primarily cellulose fiber, paper towels and similar products contain **synthetic polymers (plastics)**. These polymers act as ""wet strength agents"" (e.g., polyamide-epichlorohydrin or PAE resins) preventing the paper from dissolving immediately when wet, and also improve dry strength and absorbency. So, while you're cleaning up a spill, you're interacting with a blend of natural and synthetic materials.
* **Plastic Packaging:** The most obvious plastic link is the ubiquitous **plastic film packaging** that wraps most paper towel rolls, protecting them from moisture.

The introduction of these polymers to papermaking became widespread from the mid-20th century onwards. What started as natural fiber production has evolved into a sophisticated chemical process to enhance performance – often at the cost of pure biodegradability and potential microplastic shedding.

# Feminine Hygiene: A Major Source of Hidden Plastics

If paper products contain polymers, what about other absorbent items in close contact with the body? Our discussion quickly turned to feminine hygiene products, revealing a significant source of plastic exposure:

* **Pads (Sanitary Napkins):** Can be **up to 90% plastic!** This includes the leak-proof backsheet (polyethylene), the dry topsheet against the skin (polypropylene/polyethylene), and Super Absorbent Polymers (SAPs) in the core, which are often polyacrylate gels derived from crude oil. Adhesives and individual wrappers are also plastic.
* **Tampons:** While the absorbent core is typically cotton or rayon, many tampons feature **plastic applicators**, a **polyester string**, and may have a thin plastic layer around the core to maintain shape. All come with plastic wrappers.

Considering the prolonged, intimate contact these products have with the body, the potential for microplastic shedding and absorption is a significant concern.

# Microplastics in Humans: Where Are They Being Found?

The evidence is mounting: microplastics are not just in our environment; they are inside us. Research has detected microplastics in:

* **Blood:** Circulating throughout the body.
* **Lungs:** Likely from inhaling airborne particles.
* **Placenta:** Found in both maternal and fetal tissue, indicating potential transfer to developing babies.
* **Major Organs:** Detected in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and even the heart.

# The Body's Response: Are Plastics Stored in Fat?

This leads to a critical question: how does the body handle these foreign invaders? Similar to certain toxic chemicals (like BPA and phthalates, which are often *additives* to plastics), the body appears to store microplastics and their associated chemicals in fatty tissues.

* **Lipophilic Nature:** Many plastic chemicals are ""fat-loving"" (lipophilic) and ""water-hating"" (hydrophobic), making them readily absorbed and stored in adipose tissue (fat).
* **Adipose Tissue as a Buffer:** While this storage can initially sequester toxins away from vital organs, it creates a long-term internal source of exposure, especially when fat is metabolized (e.g., during weight loss).
* **Impact on Fat Cells:** Studies suggest microplastics and their chemical load can act as ""obesogens,"" potentially boosting fat cell growth, inducing inflammation, and disrupting metabolic function.
* **Immune Encapsulation:** The physical plastic particles can also trigger an immune response, leading to encapsulation and chronic low-grade inflammation.

# Taking Action: Reducing Your Microplastic Exposure

While it's impossible to eliminate all exposure, proactive steps can significantly reduce your daily intake and interaction with microplastics. You've already made excellent progress by choosing stainless steel/glass for drinks and prioritizing natural clothing fibers! Here are further actionable ideas:

* **Avoid Hot Liquid in Paper Cups:** Coffee cups and fast-food drink cups are lined with plastic that sheds microplastics when hot. Bring your own reusable mug.
* **No Plastic in the Microwave:** Heat dramatically increases plastic shedding. Always transfer food to glass or ceramic for reheating.
* **Ditch Non-Stick Cookware:** Replace scratched or worn non-stick (Teflon) pans with cast iron, stainless steel, or ceramic.
* **Switch to Wood Cutting Boards:** Plastic cutting boards shed microplastics directly into your food with every chop.
* **Opt for Loose-Leaf Tea & Traditional Coffee:** Many tea bags contain plastic, and plastic coffee pods are a source.
* **Choose Glass or Cans Over Plastic:** For packaged foods where possible (e.g., sauces, condiments).

# 2. In the Laundry Room:

* **Install a Washing Machine Filter:** Devices like PlanetCare or Filtrol attach to your washer to catch microfibers before they enter wastewater.
* **Use Guppyfriend Bags or Cora Balls:** These capture fibers during the wash cycle if you still use synthetic clothing.
* **Wash Less, Cooler, and Fuller:** Wash synthetics less frequently, use cold water, shorter cycles, and full loads to reduce shedding.
* **Air Dry Everything:** The dryer is a major source of airborne microplastics. Air-drying is gentler and keeps fibers contained.

# 3. Improving Home Air Quality:

* **Invest in a HEPA Air Filter:** A good air purifier can remove airborne microplastics from your living spaces.
* **Dust Regularly with Natural Cloths:** Use cotton cloths, not microfiber, and vacuum frequently with a HEPA-filtered vacuum.

By understanding these hidden sources and making conscious choices, we can collectively work towards a healthier environment and healthier bodies. It's a journey, but every step counts!",1,1761741004.0,elevotv,0,1.0,False

**Pictures:** [https://imgur.com/a/w4oLsKY](https://imgur.com/a/w4oLsKY)

**Northville to Lake Placid Trail (NPT):** The Northville to Lake Placid trail, or Northville Placid Trail, or just the 'NPT' for short is an approximately 138 mile end-to-end trail located in the heart of the Adirondacks. The southern terminus is located in Northville, NY and the northern Terminus is located on the outskirts of Lake Placid, NY.  I hiked this trail SOBO over the last week of August into the first week of September.

**Day 1, Lake Placid to Seward Lean-to:** I began day one at the former Train Station in Lake Placid around 1030 under overcast skies and drizzly weather in the lower 60's. After an unremarkable road-walk, the first section of trail was rough singletrack characterized by mossy, decaying boardwalks and overgrown sections through muddy coniferous forest. I was warned about blowdowns and mud, but nobody warned me about slippery wooden planks. Not even half way through my first day on the trail I lost count the number of times a slick piece of lumber tried to send me slip n' sliding to an untimely death. After the first 12 miles, I contemplated stopping at Duck Hole for the evening but with the trail finally opening up to fairly flat wide stretches with minimal roots and rocks, I decided to hike a few more miles. I spent the evening instead on the banks of the Cold River next to a swimming hole at Seward Shelter. My GPS clocked day one at 21.42 miles and 2802ft of elevation gain.

**Day 2, Seward Lean-to to Catlin Bay #2:** I had a great night's sleep at Seward Shelter listening to the cold river gurgling nearby and woke up feeling great. The trail started off relatively flat and smooth again, similar to the  evening prior which let me log some solid mileage in the morning before the trail turned more rugged and mucky again on the approach to Long Lake. I passed several great shelters along the way (Kelly Point was particularly nice) before ultimately decided to pitch my tent at Catlin Bay #2.  The NAT GEO map says the site is only accessible by boat, but with some rock-hopping along the shore, you can easily get there on foot. Catlin Bay #2 is a beautiful tent site on a peninsula overlooking the lake, surrounded by pine trees and blueberry bushes - Sad I missed blueberry season, but blueberry season also coincides with bug-season, so maybe the tradeoff was worth it. With the sun finally breaking through the clouds, I ended the day swimming in Long Lake, looking for fresh-water mussels, and reading by the fire after sunset. My GPS clocked day two at 15.25 miles and 1581ft of elevation gain.

**Day 3, Catlin Bay #2 to Stephens Pond:**  After heavy rain overnight, I packed up early and set off South under overcast skies again excited about the prospect of crossing Blue Mountain, the highest point on the trail. On the way, I ran into another thru hiker headed Northbound with her dog. We chatted for a bit and laughed about the fact that we had both startled each other, neither of us having seen anyone else for the last two days. Shortly afterwards, I began the long climb up Blue Mountain. Blink and you'll miss the ""Scenic overlook"" at the top but views from the beaver meadow after descending were rewarding. A few miles later I passed Tirrell Pond and stumbled across a couple of canoes. It seemed like a shame to pass by without putting them to good use, so just for fun I paddled around the pond with the Loons for a bit before moving on. A few miles later, I rested at Lake Durant for a couple of hours to have some lunch, charge my devices and dry out my tent, but the real highlight of this break was the 'Ding-A-Ling Ice Cream Truck' that rolled through the campground. 15 minutes later, fueled by two Blue Bunny Chipwhiches, I set out again to end day three at Stephen's Pond Lean-To where I watched two beavers playing on the far side of the pond as the sun went down. My GPS clocked day three at 20.24 miles and 2799ft of elevation gain.

**Day 4, Stephen's Pond Lean-to to Cedar Lakes Lean-to #2**: Not a very restful sleep; I woke up several times in the night to coyotes howling, and even saw a pale white cayote flitting across the trail shortly after leaving the lean-to around 6AM. I crossed several more beaver meadows and bridges throughout the day on the approach to the prettiest section of trail, the West Canada Lakes region; a welcome break from the rugged sections on days prior. Of note, I also got stung by a bee several miles in and the thought briefly crossed my mind that I hadn't been stung in probably 20 years; I hoped I hadn't developed an allergy since then, the nearest road being over 10+ miles away. Otherwise, a charming but fairly uneventful day, and I arrived at Cedar Lakes Lean-to #2 mid-afternoon. I nailed the bear-hang on my first try and spent the afternoon exploring Cedar Lake and skipping rocks. My GPS clocked day four at 20.14 miles and 2546ft of elevation gain.

**Day 5, Cedar Lakes Lean-to #2 to Falls Brook Campsite:** I finally awoke to clear blue skies and set off on what I intended to be a short day. Unfortunately, when I reached my destination, Spruce Lake #1, the shelter was a huge turn-off.  It was extremely dirty, with trash both in and around the site along with a plethora of critters inside the shelter nibbling on the crumbs, and the shelter smelled awful. Although the nearby canoes tempted me to stay, ultimately, I decided to press on and ended the day instead at Falls Brook Campsite; a great spot on flat ground right on a babbling brook. Another thru-hiker wandered in later headed Northbound on a Yo-Yo of the NPT and we swapped trail stories over dinner, made a fire and bedded down for the evening. My GPS clocked day five at 16.99 miles and 2257ft of elevation gain.

**Day 6, Falls Brook Campsite to Silver Lake Lean-to:** After a restful slumber, I woke up early to break down camp, said farewell and good luck to my camp companion and headed South just as the sun was coming up. A few miles later, I emerged from the woods into the town of Piseco, stopping to see Piseco Bob on the way. For anyone unfamiliar with the NPT, Piseco Bob is a local legend on the trail. The NPT passes right by his house, and he graciously lets hikers refill water, recharge, take (or leave) some snacks, and entertains. After regaling me with stories of his time as an Alaskan Salmon fisherman, I waved goodbye and set out again on the remainder of the road walk through town. Most people you talk to will tell you that Blue Mountain is the only real climb on the NPT, but I found this to be misleading. Although slightly less steep and slightly less elevation gain than Blue Mountain, the relentless uphill hike from Piseco to Silver Lake was equally as grueling. I arrived at Silver Lake in the evening, only to be frustrated again by an unkempt shelter. It's clear that the Silver Lake lean-to sees a lot of traffic and seems to be the place where NOBO hikers leave all of the heavy stuff they wish they hadn't brought in the first place. The shelter was filled with trash, empty cans of discarded bug-spray, cups, aluminum cans, blankets, jars, an entire open bag of coffee and various other assorted leave-behinds. After a brief tour and cleanup around the shelter, I decided to move downhill to the designated camping area on the water and set up my tent for the evening instead. Although frustrated by the shelter, I was rewarded by an evening canoeing around the lake and an absolutely breathtaking sunset. My GPS clocked day six at 22.07 miles and 2497ft of elevation gain.

**Day 7, Silver Lake Lean-to to Northville, NY:** After rolling out of my sleeping bag at 4AM, I took some time to consult the map and decided to try for the final 25+ miles in one-day to finish out my thru-hike. The trail was a bit spooky in the pre-dawn and navigating blowdowns via headlamp provided some unique challenges, but my final day on the trail though arduous was enjoyable nonetheless. I passed by Woods Lake, enjoying the soft cushion of pine-needles underfoot after some hard miles the previous day and ""forded"" the mighty West Stony Creek without so much as getting my toes wet. After the final road walk into town, I crossed under the NPT arch and had an amazing sandwich from the local deli while I waited for the local ice cream shop to open, only to realize that the day I arrived they had switched over to their Fall hours and were closed for the day. Devastated, I settled for a Klondike bar from Stewart's across the street instead, loaded my pack into the car and headed home. My GPS clocked day seven at 25.19 miles and 2884ft of elevation gain.

**Overall Impression:** Most trails are about the journey, not the destination. For the NPT, I'd argue the opposite: It is about the destination at the end of each day.  Although the trail is pretty in its own right, every day I found myself looking forward to exploring the next shelter or campsite, canoeing on a lake in the evening, soaking my sore feet in an ice cold river over dinner, relaxing by the fire or watching the sun go down over the water. Almost every shelter and campsite I passed was something special and deserves to be luxuriated in.

**General Trail Info:**

*Parking & Trailhead*: The Northern terminus is the Lake Placid North Elba Historical Society, and/or Lake Placid train station: 242 Station Street, Lake Placid, NY. There is a trail register located on the west side of the old train station. Alternatively, if you want to skip the first mile-ish of road walking and start on the trail itself, you can park at 211 Averyville Rd, Lake Placid, NY.  There is also a trail register at this parking area.  The Southern terminus is located in Northville, NY, right next to the ""Village Scoop Ice Cream Shop"" at 142 S Main St, Northville, NY. Pass through the Northville Placid Trail arch to access the few reserved parking spaces for hikers. Again, if you want to skip the last few miles of road-walking, there is also a parking lot where the trail enters the woods along Collins-Gifford Valley Road, coordinates: 43.213946597245304, -74.20789626978716.

*Water Carries:* Water is plentiful. I hiked the NPT during a historic drought, and still never ran short of water. I crossed a stream, river, lake, or pond every few miles and every shelter and campsite I stopped at was either right on a body of water, or a short walk away.

*Camping:* Although the NYDEC allows primitive camping in the Adirondacks as long as your tent is at least 150 feet from a water body, road, or trail and not within areas posted with ""Camping Prohibited."" signs, it's generally impractical on the majority of the NPT. The underbrush and woods are extremely dense, and you will be hard pressed to find a good place off-trail to set up. Fortunately, there are a TON of shelters and campsites along the NPT to choose from that allow for a fairly flexible itinerary, and they're (almost) all amazing.",3,1761740899.0,CampingandHiking,0,0.72,False

1oj32lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/positivty__health/comments/1oj32lc/how_to_practice_grounding_techniques_during/,How to practice grounding techniques during anxiety episodes?,"Grounding techniques are mindfulness-based practices that anchor you in the present moment during anxiety or panic attacks by engaging your senses and redirecting focus away from distressing thoughts. These methods work by interrupting your body's fight-or-flight response and activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps restore calm.​

**Physical Grounding Techniques**

* **The 5-4-3-2-1 Method-** This is the most widely used grounding technique for anxiety attacks. It systematically engages all five senses:​
* **5 things you can see:** Look around and identify five things in your environment, noticing their colors, shapes, and details​
* **4 things you can touch:** Notice four physical sensations. the texture of your clothing, the chair beneath you, or an object in your hand​
* **3 things you can hear:** Listen for three sounds around you, whether it's traffic, a fan humming, or birds chirping​
* **2 things you can smell:** Identify two scents, like coffee, fresh air, or hand lotion​
* **1 thing you can taste:** Focus on one taste in your mouth, or take a sip of water​

By focusing on tangible sensory details, this technique shifts your attention from anxious thoughts to your immediate surroundings.​

**Grounding with Water or Ice**

Hold ice cubes in your hands or run cold water over your wrists and face. The intense cold sensation provides strong sensory input that interrupts anxiety spirals and brings immediate focus to the present moment.​

**Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)**

Inhale through your nose for four counts, hold for four, exhale for four, and hold again for four. This rhythmic pattern slows your heart rate, restores oxygen balance, and signals your brain that the threat has passed.​

**Move Your Body**

Engage in physical activity like taking a brisk walk, doing jumping jacks, or stretching. Movement disperses the physiological tension associated with panic and releases endorphins that promote calm.​

**Foot Focus Technique**

Press your feet firmly into the ground, whether sitting or standing. Notice the pressure points at your heels, balls, and toes. This physical connection to solid ground steadies your vestibular system and reduces dizziness.​

**Body Scan Meditation**

Systematically move your attention through each part of your body from head to toe, noticing sensations without judgment. Start at your feet and slowly work upward, observing tension, warmth, or other feelings. This practice strengthens your mind-body connection and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.​

**Hold a Grounding Object**

Keep a textured item like a smooth stone, key, or fidget toy in your pocket. When anxiety strikes, hold it and mentally describe its shape, weight, temperature, and texture. The rich sensory detail replaces racing thoughts.​

**Mental Grounding Techniques**

* **Talk Yourself Through It** \- When you feel panic rising, remind yourself that you're having an anxiety attack and that it will pass. Tell yourself, ""I've been through this before, and I can get through it again. This feeling is temporary"".​
* **Play Mental Games -** Redirect your mind by naming as many states, dog breeds, or cities as you can, reciting the alphabet backward, or counting backward from 100 by sevens. These cognitive tasks pull neural resources away from the fear circuit.​
* **Check the Facts** \- Focus on what's objectively happening rather than how you're interpreting it. Distinguish between actual facts and anxious thoughts. This helps correct distorted thinking patterns and reduces catastrophizing.​
* **Name and Validate Your Emotions** \- Identify and name what you're feeling without judgment. Simply acknowledging ""I feel anxious"" or ""I feel overwhelmed"" can reduce the intensity of the emotion and help you regain control.​
* **Visualize Your Safe Place** \- imagine yourself in a real or imaginary place that makes you feel safe and calm. If it's the beach, visualize the warm sun on your skin, the sound of waves, and the feel of sand under your feet. Engaging all senses in this visualization reduces stress hormone production.​
* **Tips for Effective Practice** \- Practice regularly, even when calm. Rehearsing grounding techniques when you're not anxious makes them easier to access during a panic attack. Practice takes less mental effort and becomes more automatic over time.​

**Notice early warning signs-** Watch for cues like chest tightness, feeling ""unreal,"" rapid heartbeat, or shallow breathing. Ground yourself as soon as you notice these signals rather than waiting for full-blown panic.​

**Pair techniques with deep breathing-** Combining grounding with controlled breathing enhances the calming effects and helps regulate your nervous system more effectively.​

**Rate your distress before and after-** On a scale of 1-10, note your anxiety level before starting a grounding exercise and again afterward. This helps you identify which techniques work best for you.​

**Be patient with yourself-** Grounding takes practice and becomes easier over time. Don't judge yourself if it doesn't work perfectly at first your nervous system will learn to relax more readily with repeated practice.​

**Avoid assigning values-**  When describing your environment, focus on basic observations rather than judgments about whether things are good or bad.​

Grounding techniques provide immediate relief during anxiety episodes and, when practiced consistently, help build long-term emotional resilience and stress management skills.",1,1761740621.0,positivty__health,0,1.0,False

During that time trainee pa lang siya as supervisor kaya di pa nataas sahod niya, na delay yung inaasahan niyang bayad sa mga OTs niya kaya mababa lang sinahod niya. Nagsheshare kasi siya sa house nila kaya nagkulang yung budget niya. Wala akong idea na na zero siya. Wala pa siyang ipon that time kaya he’s living paycheck to paycheck. I always ask him kung meron pa ba siyang pang gastos pero he would always say na meron. He never asked money from me. Ako yung nagkukusa na mag bigay sa kaniya pero lagi niya tinatanggihan. 

And then all of a sudden, idk, girl’s instinct? First time niya na may maging ka close na girl sa 9 years naming pagsasama. Pamilyado na yung girl, she’s 29 and may child and husband na. Okay lang sakin kasi I trusted him so much. And to think na may family na yung girl. I know his passwords sa socials niya pero di ko habit na iopen. Pero may sudden feeling ako dun sa girl, parang uneasy ako. I linked his Whatsapp account sa phone ko, pagka pasok niya chinat niya yung girl asking kung nasaan siya kasi sunduin niya sana siya. I confronted him about it, he said na he did it kasi wala na siyang pera. Bale ang nangyayari pala is si girl ang nagbabayad ng parking niya. Parang ganun daw yung usapan nila. Ihahatid or sundo niya siya basta si girl ang magbabayad ng parking. Na since active pa naman daw yung move it account niya, ibobook daw siya ng ka work niya. Pero I checked his move it account, wala namang history na may nag book sa kaniya. I asked him bakit hindi siya mag ask sakin, since may ipon ako. We’re partners kako pero nahihiya siya lumapit sakin. Hanggang sa naging okay kami. I told him not to do it again kasi I don’t feel comfortable sa set up nila. But then, he did it again. And si girl ang nag request na ihatid siya pauwi and pumayag siya. He didn’t know na naka share location niya sakin, and I was asking him kung nasaan siya pero he lied na nasa house daw siya kahit may evidence na ako. He even got mad nung chinat ko yung girl. But my purpose was to ask for clarity. Kasi if there’s really something going on between them, I’d leave. Pero hangga’t hindi ko naririnig sa kaniya na may gusto siya dun, I really want to stay kasi I love him so much.

Idk pero parang that time hate niya ako. Halos araw araw akong naiyak sa harap niya kasi I want him to be honest with me. Kasi kahit na sabihin kong itigil na niya, nagbubura pa rin siya ng convos nila and nag sisinungaling pa rin siya. I aked him multiple times kung may gusto ba siya sa girl na yun, pero wala raw. 3 sila nun na laging magkasama, siya, yung gay friend niya tapos yung girl. Pero si girl ang lagi niyang nacocontact. Nung nalaman niyang nalilink yung Whatsapp sa other phone, lumipat siya sa text message. But I find ways hahahah kaya nalaman ko pa rin. The universe is giving me all the evidence that time pero he kept on denying all of it. Parang mas naging dependent siya doon sa tropahan nila. Na parang ayun yung safe space niya that time. Si boyfriend ko pa raw lagi ang nagyayaya lumabas after ng shift nila. Sabi ko mag hiwalay na kami that time kasi nahihirapan na ako pero ayaw niya. He kept on saying na mahal niya ako and wala raw talaga siyang gusto doon sa girl. Pinipilit ko raw kasi na meron kahit wala naman talaga.

It’s been 5 months nung nangyari yun. Pero it’s still haunting me. Ang traumatizing pala. I’m seeing his efforts to gain my trust back. I always ask him kung bakit niya nagawa na mag lie sakin, na mag tago sakin, lagi niyang sinasagot na hindi niya rin daw alam. Na wala raw siya sa katinuan nun.

1oj2xkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cormoran_strike/comments/1oj2xkl/murphy_and_boundaries/,Murphy and boundaries,"This is kind of a follow-up to the ""Liar, Liar"" post from u/MapsBooksCoffee but this time I want to look specifically at boundaries (and apologies, this is rather long).

Robin challenges Murphy on his sobriety twice. The first time is the evening of the condom incident, when he explodes and storms out: “*What was she playing at, asking him if he was back on the booze; was a man not allowed to be tired?*” When he comes back, he apologises, but blames his outburst on Robin who acted like his ex-wife, implying, *“*You triggered me by acting like my ex.*”*  
Her reasonable question about drinking is reframed as a personal attack, while the real issue (condoms, morning-after pills, and so on) is completely ignored. Robin is left feeling guilty and ashamed.

Then, at Christmas, Murphy lashes out again: “*The fuck’s that supposed to mean?*”. Cobra anger. Later, in Robin’s bedroom, he interrogates her about her drinking: “*But I’m the one drinking?”* and “*Why did you get so drunk?*” Once again, he frames it as though *s*he has attacked his integrity. He becomes the wronged party, and Robin is the one who must justify herself and repair the situation.

So Murphy’s sobriety becomes a no-go zone, enforced through anger (and remember, Robin is very sensitive to shouting). While it’s understandable that sobriety can be a sensitive subject for a recovering alcoholic, his behaviour becomes deeply problematic when the respect he demands for his own boundaries isn’t reciprocated. It creates a power imbalance.

Now let’s compare this with another sensitive topic: egg freezing.

In Chapter 9, Murphy arrives at Robin’s flat after she’s been discharged. She tells him about Rowntree. She’s clearly upset, tired, and hormonal. Murphy brings up egg freezing: *“Can’t we discuss it? (…) No, not that. About freezing your eggs.*”

Robin replies: *“I haven’t thought about it.*” That’s her boundary. Ideally, he’d respect it, maybe suggest coming back to the topic later. Instead, he presses: “*Don’t you think it might be a good idea? To be on the safe side?*” It’s worded so that saying “no” sounds absurd. Who wouldn’t want to be “on the safe side”? 

Robin resists: “*What safe side?*” She brings the conversation back to what egg freezing actually involves (hormones, anaesthetic, multiple cycles) . She's reasserting her boundary. 

But, Murphy ignores it and latches onto her last point: “*Why wouldn’t they be viable? You’re only thirty-two.*” So, instead of engaging with her concerns (hormones, anaesthetic etc.), he reduces everything she’s said to a matter of age, as if her age automatically cancels out all her other concerns. By that point, he’s also ignoring the fact that the conversation is making Robin upset, angry, and close to tears.

Then, out of nowhere, Murphy says: “*I feel like you’re blaming me.*” Here he does something subtle but powerful. He shifts the conversation from her concern (hormones, anaesthetic etc.) to his feelings. It derails the conversation. So instead of discussing her concerns, it becomes about reassuring him. Robin is forced to soothe and clarify (“*I’m not blaming you*”) while still trying to hold her ground.

But Murphy again dismisses her concerns (again hormones, the procedure etc.), seizes on her last point, implying she’s prioritising work: “*Can you not forget about work for two minutes?*” Robin pushes back: “*That’s rich coming from you! You’ve been working round the clock lately!*” She’s calling out the double standard: he criticises her for prioritising work, yet does the same himself.  
Murphy then sidesteps the point and apologises for leaving her alone, which feels like he’s implying, *“*Oh, so that’s what you’re upset about??? You’re angry because I wasn’t here today!!*”* That's not the point Murphy!

Then he adds: “*I’m asking you to put yourself first*.” On the surface, it sounds kind and reasonable. Who wouldn’t want to prioritise themselves? In reality, it’s a false framing of autonomy. He borrows the language of self-care and independence (“*put yourself first*”), and make his request sound supportive, even empowering, while still steering her toward what he wants. Kudos to Robin for noticing: “*You’re asking me to put my eggs first. My eggs and I are not the same thing.*” She’s nailed what Murphy sees in her, though I wish she’d pushed that thought even further.

Then Murphy tries to sound supportive: “*I’m trying to tell you that if you want to do the egg thing, I’d support you through it, I’d be with you*.” Again, on the surface, that’s an offer of care. But genuine support would be unconditional, not *“if you want to do the egg thing.”* The subtext is that there might not be any support if she chooses not to do it (also note the shift to *“*egg thing*”*, which distances the emotional weight of *“*egg freezing.*”*).

I could go on, but you see where this is going.  
When the attempt in Chapter 9 fails, Murphy switches tactics. In Chapter 75, he gives Robin intel on the Peugeot before bringing up egg freezing again, as though gratitude might soften her resistance. In Chapter 81, he goes for the emotional angle: “*What would you have wanted to do if it hadn’t been ectopic?*” It’s a question that tests her emotional limits.

What this really shows is a power imbalance, and the slow erosion of Robin’s boundaries. Murphy’s boundaries are untouchable. Robin has learned not to risk his anger or make the same mistake as the ex-wife. And what makes it truly chilling is that she was right to question him.

Meanwhile, Murphy doesn’t just ignore Robin’s boundaries, he gradually erodes them. Her boundaries become negotiable, and every time she defends them, she’s reframed as difficult, emotional, or immature. You can feel the impact this has on someone’s confidence and mental health over time. Each time she resists, she’s made to feel like the aggressor or the unreasonable one. Eventually, resistance starts to feel pointless, or even dangerous. And as the book progresses and other trauma piles on, her resistance begins to thin, which is exactly what happens when someone keeps crossing your boundaries and framing it as your fault.

Anyway, thanks for reading and I’d love to read your thoughts!

1oj2xji,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oj2xji,Halloween OneShot - Dust & Devils DM Prep & Ghost Train Terrain,"So I ran this adventure last night at a local dnd club for their halloween social. The story blends a western setting with a halloween ghost train, where the local sheriff offers the players their freedom if they agree to stop The Dread Conductor, or all hell is gonna break loose... I had an absolute blast, with a keen party of 5, including two known players and three new faces!

The 3 new sign-ups included a veteran who has been playing since the 80's and showed up in full cowboy attire, with a homemade cigar prop - what a hero! Another brought his own kitbashed minis including an artificer's flamethrower cannon (didnt see that one coming!) and lastly a guy completely new to playing dnd (had watched lots of online shows and been wanting to try it out - he was a natural!). Everyone got stuck in, the dynamic seemed to be bang on and it was everything I'd hoped for.

For those interested in the pictures/prep/crafting, Ive put a brief description below, otherwise, good luck with your halloween games!

First photo is a behind the scenes view of the DM screen in case people like seeing behind the curtain. I always setup before an event to make sure it all fits and ive got enough space behind the screen as I had a lot of props. It is the DM screen woth the red dragon on the front, with an ikea slip mat taped to the front to make it look dark and with two promotional barcardi chests that I found on ebay. My rolling tray is the lid from my mini box (the box my allsaints t-shirts came in). My favourite prop made was a wanted poster of a player character that i did in pencil, using a photo of an art piece she had commisioned and the phone app Trace and Sketch to draw the main dark lines. Having the in-game moment of, ""Well, ive got to hand it to the artist who did your wanted poster, he deserves a raise for this one..."" and flopping it over the screen... priceless!

Other photos are of the ghost train terrain scenes I made from poster board foam (white film removed with hand dryer) and a load of coffee stirrers, along with paint and glue etc. I made modular wall sections to allow for a bigger final boss room without having to make two size carriages and used a cardboard box to cover the whole carriage so they could jump onto it as part of theor plan to board, painted black and brown. It also helped shield it and stop the overly cautious inching 5ft at a time in a conga line ive seen happen if placing the whole scene down straight away.

Minis: Mostly painted by me from wizkids / blacklist miniatures and one 3d printed flameskull from a bulk buy of bits bought on FB Marketplace.

Creatures encountered: Poltergeists, Mimics, Zombies, Boneless, Flameskull, Skeletons, Hell Hound & Dread Conductor (Devil).

Adventure Creator: Dorian Ellis (DMs Guild)

Looking forward to seeing more of your halloween crafting in the feed, there were 3 crafters at the table last night, the community is growing each day!",5,1761740230.0,DnDIY,0,0.86,False

1oj2wlc,https://i.redd.it/zye4wqmzl1yf1.jpeg,FRENCH PRESS BLUE TOKAI COFFEE REVIEW AS FIRST TIMER,"This will be a very informal review.

Before starting my Speciality Coffee Journey, around 20 days ago, I had only experienced Easy Pour Overs, other than instant. But I always wanted to move on...

So, with a mind of buying a Moka Pot, I posted on this sub, asking for recommendations.

Over time, and talking to some very good souls, I realized that the French Press I have with me will work much fine as a starter, as I drink coffee black, like 99.99%.

So, again taking recommendations from people here, I bought Blue Tokai's Sampler Packs (as seen in the image). 

The first coffee I tried was Barbara Estate, 15 g in 250 ml (following Hoffman 60g/ltr ratio). It was stepping into heaven... so... full and delicious. But I found the coffee extremely strong (maybe because its my first time with Speciality coffee?). Also, it was too much for me. So, dropping the ratio, I tried with 10 g for 200 ml (instead of 12 g coffee for 200 ml as per the standard ratio). This time, it was PERFECT. Not too strong and not too light. Just enough to last me the rest of the day (I drink in afternoon, still on instant in morning as I take it as pre-workout).

Anyway, lasted me 7 days. I opened the rest of the two sampler packs then, instead of finishing only one. 

Out of the three of them, Barbara Estate felt the most delicious to me. Then, Silver Oak Cafe Blend and Kalledevarapura Blend.

Ordered Diwali Blend as well (as it was on sale) and will have it after finishing Samplers.

In the end, just wanna say that if you are like me, lingering on the horizon to go for Speciality Coffee then... Just Go For It.

No need to invest too much money from the get go. A french press and good coffee is all you need to take the step and enjoy life... 

I am happy.

The shader I want to do is very simple. I have a mug with coffee inside of it and want the spoon inside this coffee to have a lighter outline where the spoon touches the coffee. It should work exactly like the foam part of a water shader.

The coffee in my case is just a plane with a brown material on it. And there should just be a lighter circle aorund the part that is intersected by the spoon.  
I tried looking up tutorials on water shaders with shader graph and copied just the parts for the foam, but that doesnt work.  
I also asked chat gpt a lot for hlsl shaders, but also no luck there. 

I feel like the effect I want is not that complicated and should be fairly easy to implement, but I'm completely stuck and don't know how I should even figure out what to do.

Does anyone here have any resources or can tell me how to do this shader?

My friends and family would joke saying *“He just loves to chill”* but I don’t even enjoy it. I hate it. I can’t seem to get out of this rut and i'm 32.

Most mornings I wake up with decent intentions. I’ll think about all the things I want to do that day, get my mortgage docs in order, go gym, clean up - but once I’ve had my coffee and opened my laptop, that’s it. Game over. The day just evaporates.

I work from home, so there’s no real external push unless I have an appointment or something urgent. If I don’t do the dishes or clean, it’ll sit there until it becomes a crisis and my gf is affected. It’s like my brain only kicks in when there’s a real consequence.

I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, but I’m planning to see a doctor soon. Still, there’s this part of me that thinks, *“How will that actually help?”* Like, will they just tell me to go to cbt? It’s not that I don’t know what to do it’s that I can’t seem to make myself do it.

Anyone else been through something like this? And if you did get help, what actually made a difference?",31,1761740097.0,ADHD,17,0.98,False
