I'm planning to come to Hong Kong & Shenzhen these upcoming days (Hong Kong for the weekend), and Shenzhen Starting Sunday 20th July to 23rd. I am flying in to come see all the amazing tech I hear of for myself. I am both a robotics and software engineer and would love to see the latest tech coming out of Shenzhen, specifically robotics, drones, self-driving cars, sensors, and other industrial tech that can change the world.

Ultimately, I would LOVE to meet factory owners, or tech startups that I can partner with and potentially try to market their technology in other parts of the world, such as in California, where I live. Although given the current trade war and our clown of a president I'm not sure how well that would be taken. I'm also Egyptian if that helps, maybe I can use more of that identity instead if it helps lol. I'm just a nerd and here for the tech, with a passion for entrepreneurship, and definitely open to potential partnerships.

Given that I don't speak Chinese, or know any locals there, how hard would it be to get some factory/company tours? Also I heard there are mega malls with thousands of pieces of technology, I would love to check out!

Industries I'm interested in: Tech (mainly), but also interested in the textile/fashion industry, as well as the appliances/furniture industry and think it could be really interesting to potentially bring some of it back to the US. 

If you can recommend where I should stay to be central to all this I would really appreciate it! Also if there any locals there willing to meet up for coffee or show me around I would be more than grateful! Thank you friends!!",1,1752660631.0,shenzhen,0,1.0,False

1m18q0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m18q0r/why_choose_the_instant_pot_vortex_air_fryer_for/,Why Choose the Instant Pot Vortex Air Fryer for Your Kitchen Needs?,"The Instant Pot Vortex 140-3080-01 has become a staple in my kitchen recently. As someone who often juggles work, kids, and the eternal quest to feed my family something that isn’t just cereal or microwaved leftovers, I was intrigued by its promises of versatility and sleek design. Every time I see a gadget that claims to “do it all,” I get both hopeful and a little skeptical. After putting this air fryer to the test over the past couple of weeks (yes, it has been through everything from chicken wings to reheated leftover pizza), I’m ready to share all the juicy details.

**Sleek and Compact Design That Fits Just About Anywhere**  
I've owned my fair share of kitchen appliances, and many end up stuffed in cabinets because they either take up half my counter or look clunky. This air fryer is compact yet spacious with its 5.7-quart capacity. It comfortably sat next to my coffee maker without dominating my limited counter space. Given its black plastic exterior with clean lines, it even managed to look impressive sitting there—my mother-in-law actually thought it was some kind of high-tech coffee machine when she first walked in. It’s not just a looker; the build feels solid, and despite it being lighter than expected at 12.2 pounds, it doesn’t feel cheap or flimsy.

**User-Friendly Features with Touch Control Magic**  
I'm not one for reading lengthy instruction manuals (who has time for that?), so I was thrilled to see how intuitive the touch control panel was. One-touch smart programs meant recreating my favorite foods could be done in seconds. I quickly figured out how to roast veggies, bake cookies, and of course, air fry those delightful, crispy wings. The multiple temperature options from 120 to 400°F gave me an extra layer of control, which was helpful when roasting delicate items like asparagus. I even customized programs to finetune how I liked my fries—extra crispy, obviously.

**EvenCrisp Technology Delivers That Golden Perfection**  
This feature was a total game-changer for me. The EvenCrisp technology drives airflow from top to bottom, ensuring my food cooked evenly every time. It’s been an ordeal in the past to get homemade fries to have the right balance of crunch and softness, but not anymore. Even when experimenting with frozen foods like mozzarella sticks and samosas, I noticed this machine delivered consistent results without requiring endless flipping or adjustments.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact design with a spacious 5.7-quart capacity.  
- Intuitive touch panel with customizable programs.  
- EvenCrisp technology ensures evenly cooked crispy results.  
- Rapid preheating for those ""I'm too hungry to wait"" moments.  

**Cleaning Is a Breeze with Dishwasher-Friendly Parts**  
One of my least favorite parts about cooking used to be the aftermath. The Instant Vortex made this significantly easier with its non-stick air fry basket and tray. Toss them in the dishwasher, and I’m done. No scrubbing, no scrapping. It handled sticky sauces like barbeque glaze without leaving hard, stubborn residue. For those moments when I gave it a quick handwash, the non-stick coating made things practically slide off.

**Negatives**  
- The exterior plastic can get smudged easily, so fingerprints occasionally needed wiping down.  
- Noise levels were noticeable at times during operation, especially with longer cooking cycles.

**Safety Features That Inspire Confidence While Cooking**  
As a mom who occasionally forgets she’s left something in the oven (and has had multiple smoke alarms confirm this), the built-in Overheat Protection and auto-off functions felt like lifesavers. It even prevented me from overcooking delicate items like fish fillets, automatically stopping when I got distracted by, well, life. Knowing the machine had comprehensive safety measures made me feel more relaxed using it.

**Competing Products**  
A few of my friends swear by the Ninja Air Fryer lineup, so naturally, I’ve tried them during dinner parties. While they perform well, I found the Instant Vortex's customizable settings gave me more creative control in comparison. On another occasion, I borrowed a Philips Air Fryer, which also has a strong reputation, but it was bulkier, and cleaning was much less convenient than this air fryer’s dishwasher-friendly tray. I’d also argue the Instant Vortex gives better bang for its buck.

**True Value in Every Meal**  
For everything it offers, the price feels justified compared to other air fryers I’ve looked into. Between the compact design, modern features like EvenCrisp, and all the built-in safety aspects, it has become my favorite kitchen helper. It's the kind of appliance that gets used frequently because it truly adds value without being overcomplicated. If you're wondering if it's worth the investment, let me tell you—yes, it is.

1m18pwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m18pwr/emotionally_draining_new_mum_friend_advice_needed/,Emotionally draining new mum friend - advice needed!,"In the past year, I became a mum for the first time. With most of my close friends and family living far away, I wanted to connect with other local mums to avoid feeling isolated during maternity leave. I joined a pregnancy yoga class and the Peanut app. I made great connections through yoga and one mum through Peanut – let’s call her “Peanut”.

At first, Peanut and I got on well. We met up for coffees, baby groups, walks, and hung out casually. But soon she started bombarding me daily with messages and voice notes – not just about parenting, but every aspect of her life. She also befriended one of my yoga mum friends, and the three of us made a WhatsApp group. However, Peanut began privately criticising the yoga friend and venting about her partner, which I didn’t feel comfortable engaging in.

Over time, she became more demanding — trying to dictate where, when, and how we met to fit around her toddler’s nap schedule. I was understanding to a point, but it started feeling like she wasn’t considering my time or needs at all.

The tipping point was when she went on holiday for three weeks and went quiet (which I expected). But when she got back, she accused me of “disappearing.” I explained I thought she was just enjoying her holiday and that I’d been busy too — she seemed to accept that. But weeks later, she sent me a long voice note having a go at me for not checking in, not prioritising her, and for inviting her to a group event instead of making one-on-one time.

I responded, setting boundaries and explaining that life is busy, I don't message most friends constantly, and I prefer more low-maintenance friendships. She said she disagreed with that kind of friendship and expected regular check-ins. It made me realise how intense and one-sided the dynamic had become.

Since then, nothing’s changed — she’s still messaging constantly, sharing memes, commenting on everything I post, and rearranging plans last-minute to suit her. She even made a dismissive comment about me spending time with my brother, who’s visiting from abroad, implying I should still make time for her.

I’ve only known her a year, but this friendship feels draining and like it’s starting to impact my mental health and family time. I’ve tried being direct, setting boundaries, but she’s not respecting them. I'm at a breaking point.",2,1752660493.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Sheriff Thompson stepped out of his patrol vehicle with a grunt, being met by one of the officers on scene. 

""What we got?""

""Human remains. We found a hand, looks to be a woman's hand by the size of it and the type of wedding ring. The neighbors found it and called, a man named Jacob Webb.""

With a nod, Sheriff Thompson walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

He stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and sulfur lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" He asked as he smeared some between his fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbor that found it?""

He was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer neither. I walk in a little ways 'n see a hand on that chair so run back to my house 'n call the law. Now we standin' here talkin.""

""Did Mary have any visitors tonight that you saw?""

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Any other kids?""

""She had a husband but he died shortly after their only boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin' back then and I s'pose the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin', the next day he's...not. He was up walkin' around again like he weren't ever sick.""

Sheriff Thompson scribbled notes into his notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

Sheriff finished his notes and closed his book, tucking it into his breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr. Webb nodded, walking slowly back to his house. Sheriff Thompson went back into Mary's, continuing his observation of the scene.

<><><><><><>

The Sheriff walks into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank ya, Sheriff."" The coroner took a long drink from his cup as he sat down, blowing out a short quick breath. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that damn house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed the pictures to the Sheriff. 

""Well, the ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the bigger bone fragments in the ashes.""

The sheriff looks down at his hands, rubbing them together as if he could still feel the ash on his fingertips.

""They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not scorched part of the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that.""

The sheriff stood quickly, pushing his chair back in frustration. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah! We've been going over this case for weeks, we've been talking to every medical examiner, firefighter, police force and goddamned self proclaimed arsonist around and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense!""

Josiah sat back, placing his interlaced fingers behind his head. 

""Sheriff, I've been talking to some colleagues of mine about this to get their opinion because I was stumped too. After some some long talks and a few too many whiskey sours, I might have something. But sheriff, you have to trust me.""

""You know I trust you, Josiah, I need SOMETHING in this case.""

Josiah sat forward, looking for that trust in the sheriff's eyes as he pulled a stack of disheveled research papers from his desk drawer. 

""Let me ask you something. Have you ever heard of spontaneous human combustion?""

<><><><><>

Mary Keller sat back in her armchair, a lit cigarette perched between her shaky fingers. 

She stared at the unassuming man sat across from her, her eyes threatening to spill the tears she'd held back all night. 

""So,"" Mary said, taking a long drag ""this is it then?""

""Yes ma'am."" the man said calmly, his hands placed atop his crossed knees. 

""Please..."" she sucked in a sharp breath, a quiet sob escaping her lips. She pleaded with the man, hoping she could invoke some compassion within him. 

""Please let me have a few more years. I'm not ready to go.""

""Mary, you signed a contr-""

""I know I signed the goddamned contract! I was desperate! I didn't know what else to do!""

She placed her head in her hands and wept, the man patiently waiting for her speak again. She wiped her nose with the back of her hand and placed her cigarette, still smoldering, into the ash tray. The man stood and offered a hand to her. 

""What's it like?"" She whispered, taking his hand. The man laughed, guttural and deep.

1m18iqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m18iqc/how_should_you_store_string_lights_to_prevent/,How should you store string lights to prevent tangling?,"I recently went through the frustrating experience of untangling my string lights after storing them improperly last season. After hours of careful untangling and research, I've discovered several effective methods to store string lights properly and prevent that dreaded tangled mess.

First things first - never just stuff your string lights into a box. Trust me, I learned this the hard way. Instead, there are several proven methods that work really well:

The Cardboard Method:
Cut a piece of cardboard about 12 inches long and 6 inches wide. Make small notches on both ends. Wrap your string lights around the cardboard, securing the ends in the notches. This keeps everything organized and prevents any tangling.

The Coffee Can Technique:
Take an empty coffee can or similar container, clean it thoroughly, and wrap your string lights around it. Start from the bottom and work your way up. The cylindrical shape helps maintain the lights' shape without creating knots.

Professional Storage Solutions:
I recently found some amazing storage reels specifically designed for string lights on Amazon. These have made my life so much easier. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/String-Lights

Additional Tips I've Learned:
- Always test your lights before storing them
- Remove batteries if your lights use them
- Store in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture damage
- Label each set of lights (especially helpful during holidays)
- Keep the original packaging if possible

One thing that really helps is investing in quality storage solutions. While DIY methods work fine, proper storage containers designed specifically for string lights can make a huge difference. I've had great results with some of the options available here: https://athometouch.com/String-Lights

Remember to handle your lights carefully while storing them. Take your time wrapping them - rushing usually leads to tangles, no matter which storage method you choose. Also, consider storing different types of string lights separately to avoid confusion and make decoration setup easier next time.

By following these storage methods, you'll save yourself hours of frustration and extend the life of your string lights. Plus, when it's time to use them again, you can simply unwind them without dealing with any knots or tangles.

I've been using these techniques for the past year, and it's made a world of difference. No more spending hours untangling lights or dealing with broken bulbs from improper storage. Just organized, ready-to-use string lights whenever I need them.",1,1752659750.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1m18eyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ripenappsseo/comments/1m18eyd/how_iot_apps_are_revolutionizing_smart_home/,How IoT Apps Are Revolutionizing Smart Home Technology,"A decade ago, the idea of talking to your house seemed like a sci-fi movie scene. However, we are now in 2025, where smart homes have become an integral part of everyday life for millions of people. 

The main element driving this shift isn't only smart devices, it's the IoT apps that connect everything behind the scenes. These applications have become the control centers that make your home feel intelligent, rather than just automated. So, let's take a closer look at how IoT apps are truly changing the game: 

**1. Centralized Control Over Everything** 

Remember when you needed a different remote or app for every device? Now, a single app is enough to manage lighting, security, HVAC, and appliances from anywhere. These applications provide you with full control while sitting on the couch. For example, apps like Google Home and Apple Home allow you to: 

* Turn off all the lights at once
* Check cameras in real time
* Adjust the thermostat
* Lock or unlock doors

This centralization makes smart living seamless and allows individuals to manage their homes hassle-free. 

**2. Automation That Fits Your Life**

One of the most powerful features of IoT apps is the ability to set up custom routines. You can create schedules and triggers so your home reacts to your habits automatically. Some common examples are: 

* A **good morning** routine that turns on lights, starts the coffee maker, and plays the news. 
* A **leaving home** routine that locks doors, shuts off appliances, and arms your security system

Over time, these automations don't just save effort; they start to feel like your home genuinely understands you.

**3. Real-Time Security and Peace of Mind** 

Smart security is a necessity in this digital world because the threats have also become smart. From video doorbells to motion sensors, these systems let you see what's happening around your house in real time and get instant alerts. Some of the things you can do: 

* Watch live camera feeds
* Talk to visitors through the app
* Get notified if a window is opened or motion is detected
* Automatically call emergency contacts

The ability to monitor and respond remotely has redefined what home security means. In the future, people should be able to worry less about their home security. 

**4. Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings**

Smart thermostats, plugs, and lighting systems are making it easier to save energy without thinking about it. IoT applications give you data and recommendations to optimize your usage. For example: 

* Automatically lowering the thermostat when you're away
* Shutting off lights in empty rooms
* Tracking energy consumption trends

Besides helping the environment, these small adjustments can noticeably lower your utility bills over time.

**5. Voice Integration and Accessibility** 

Voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant are tightly integrated with IoT apps. It allows you to control your home by simply speaking the following terms: 

* ""Set the thermostat to 72 degrees.""
* ""Lock the front door.""
* ""Dim the lights in the living room."" 

This voice control is convenient, and it's also an important accessibility feature for older adults and people with disabilities. 

# Final Thoughts 

In practical terms, IoT apps turn the smart house into a truly smart one. They connect devices, run automation routines, improve security, conserve energy, and, by the way, make your life easier. In case you think it is time to turn your humble abode into an actual home. In the future, these apps will really come in handy in shaping your life. However, businesses need to partner with an IoT app development company to build an advanced IoT app and drive business growth. ",1,1752659335.0,u_ripenappsseo,0,1.0,False

I have noticed that there is a lot more discussion of burr geometry these days compared to last time I was grinder shoppping (2017), and I wonder if a new grinder might improve my cup (the feldgrind has served me well, but I find that with some coffees I get very muddy beds and long draw downs, and I need to compensate by massively reducing my pour speed by trickling water in over the back of a spoon). I have been looking at the x-ultra or, if I can justify going over budget, the k-ultra. My question is, though, has the understanding of burr geometry and design progessed enough that I am likely to notice a significant difference compared to my feldgrind? Given that all the other aspects of a grinder (a stable and rotating shaft) don't seem to be subject to significant improvements, outisde of precision, it seems only new burr shapes could make big differences).

1m186y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m186y7/nobodys_piggy_bank/,Nobody's Piggy Bank...,"I (51M) have been in a relationship with my GF (50F) for going on four years now. Three years ago we pooled our money together and decided to build a rental house in the mountains. I had planned on buying a camper to live in until we got settled into the relationship once I moved from NC to GA to be with her full time, but she decided it would be more financially feasible if I just moved into her house with her, her two teenage kids, and her retirement age parents so we'd have a little extra money to put toward the rental we were building. Her parents are financially destitute after their retirement fund was stolen in a real estate scam, so they don't contribute to the mortgage or utilities. After my GFs divorce was finalized she was court ordered to refinance the house in order to have her ex removed from the deed. Due to higher finance rates and her losing certain discounts her ex was privy to her mortgage jumped from $1500 to $2600 per month. Her ex was ordered to pay the mortgage at a rate of $1500/month as a result of the divorce settlement BEFORE the refinance, so the $1100 deficit had to be made up. She has always been a stay at home mom (no income other than her divorce settlement award), and I landed a good job once here, so I agreed to cover the $1100/month overage as well as half of the utilities. Things were ok at first, but about a year into the living situation she started getting distant and cold. We started fighting, mostly about money due to the build, but also because of the rift amongst three generations living under the same roof. Her mother is overbearing to say the least, her father is quickly becoming the typical grouchy old man, and her kids are... Well, her kids (18F and 15M) are typical teenagers. Both her kids and her parents have stuff everywhere, taking up space in the garage and any storage space in the house. About a year ago I removed the back seat from my Jeep and stood it upright on it's end in a corner of the garage, which led to comments from her mom about how I just need to put it back in my Jeep where it's not in the way. (The same financially non-contributing person who has a kayak taking up a fair portion of the side garage, along with a concrete chicken, boxes of canned goods and dried food for... I guess the end of the world, as well as their second undriven car in the driveway.) After a few months of b*tching, my GF ""gifted"" me a 5'x5' storage unit for Christmas that I'm now responsible for at $51/month. I promptly but begrudgingly moved my few items into the unit and kept my mouth shut. Fast forward to about a month ago. My GFs ex-husband started threatening to take her back to court to have his payments to her reduced since I was living there and paying almost half of the mortgage, which is still $1100/month more than he was ordered to pay. She decided we needed to start hiding my Jeep and telling him I moved out so he would drop his threats, a decision I was not on-board with. After all, I'm paying the overage on the mortgage he wasn't responsible for anyway, and I'm too old to be playing these games. I work third shift, so I'm asleep from around 3pm to 8pm or so. Last night while I was asleep, she (GF) decided I would have to start leaving my Jeep in the unsecured hospital parking lot about a quarter mile away in case he decided to try to catch me living there against what she told him, and when I woke up my keys and Jeep were gone, so I called her to ask how I was supposed to get to work. She informed me that from now on I would have to either get her dad to drive me, or her son to take me in the golf cart, or her daughter to drive me to my Jeep whenever I need to go anywhere, and pick me up when I got back. Oh. Hell. No. I've got to hope someone is around to drive me to my Jeep every time I want a cup of coffee or a slushie? First, there's no room for the few things I own anywhere in the house, so that had to go at my financial expense. Now we're playing hide the Jeep at MY inconvenience because she's afraid of him taking her back to court for reduced payments, all while I pay $1100/month on a mortgage I'm not on and half of the utilities everyone uses, all while being kept at arms length and treated poorly by everyone in the house. So I've decided to remove her fear of her ex taking her back to court by moving out. But in doing so she will also not get my financial contributions toward the household anymore. I've been feeling like I'm just there to pay the bills she can't afford herself while no consideration has ever been made for me. So am I the AH for moving out and putting the responsibility of the whole mortgage and utilities back on her?",8,1752658467.0,AITAH,17,0.9,False

I watch your videos religiously, Charlotte. It is a part of my nightly selfcare routine. Thanks for being you.

I will be addressing myself as Ellie on this post.

Okay, here goes. My last relationship lasted 7 years. Lets call him Drake. The first couple of years were good. He was a family friend so he's been hanging around my family for years prior, he was also my first, and only boyfriend i've had at the time. Firstly, it was quite messed up to think back on it now. I was 16 and he was 22, but I feel like nobody around me really found it strange because he was so close to my family at the time (I see how f\*d up it is now that I'm seeing it written out)

We spoke about getting married a lot, just planning it all and I think about 4 ish years into the relationship. I started realising that he was a serial gaslighter and very very insecure. He would be jealous of everyone I was hanging out with. I left for college shortly after this awakening and he was literally blowing up my phone every single day. Asking me where I was, who I was with etc etc. I felt very stuck. 

When I graduated, I went home. I was trying to save whatever was left of this relationship. I was 22 and him 29 at this point, we still wanted marriage (I feel so dumb even thinking about this now, but that was what I knew for a third of my life at this point) I asked him where he saw himself in the next 5 years, he couldn't give me an answer. I would have been happy to hear anything at this point but he was comfortable and not trying to reach for more. I told him, and where I f\*d up, that I needed him to get his shit together. I wanted to go on a month long break for whatever self discovery he needed, I wanted him to really think about what he wants to do in the future if his sh\*tty job didn't work out. MY ONLY RULE WAS: Don't touch my friends.

So... fast forward to a month later. I got a text from my cousin's ex girlfriend, Lets call her Mila. She told me to she needed to talk. She told me that, when I was working a job over the weekend as a photographer, she went to a pub with some friends and bumped into Drake and his brother. And since they knew each other, they hung out that night as a group. He later walked her home that night and when they arrived at her building, he said to her, I know you're still hung up on your ex (MY COUSIN) but do you need help? and she was shook and asked him to repeat and he said and i quote, ""I will still marry Ellie, but do you need help?"" Mila RAN. She told me she didn't even say bye.

That's not even the worse part, there were rumours going around about him and at this point we started talking about after our so called 'break'. These rumours suggested that he was going around and talking to a lot of people, some underaged, some not, but ALL people I knew. Then, there's this one friend of mine who came forward and tell me whats been going on. They told me a couple names that I recognised and then they said 'and me.' I almost fell to the floor. They told me that Drake initiated it and they just 'went along'. 

Basically, long story short, Drake got his D sucked by this 'friend' of mine and my eye was twitching at this point. I didn't know if I should believe it or not. So I called Drake and I asked him to come out for a coffee. He agreed and when I sat down, I told him that I knew everything. He was still tryna play dumb. I told him whatever you're thinking of right now, I know and I just wanted to hear it from him. He said you mean the BJ? and he sat there, maybe trying to think of what to marinate his lies with. Then he just said, yeah, it happened.

My jaw was so wide opened, and get ready for this... this friend that I mentioned that had the balls to tell me this face-to-face, was a guy.

I told him that if he learned something about himself that day and that I am willing to be there and support him if he needed even if it meant that we're not together. He proceeded to tell me ""Now I know I'm not gay. and I still want to try with you"" bruh. I'm sorry? You had your twinkie in his mouth where you finished.

Maybe he was trying to experiment, I don't know what it all meant and I don't think I ever will. I told him that I would not be able to come back from this and thanked him for giving me a good reason to leave. People spoke about this for years after. I felt bad because I don't know if he's just closeted or if he really just wanted to experiment.

Now, 6 years later, I'm happily married with my amazing and hardworking husband and we have a beautiful child together. Drake is also married (to a woman).

Anyway, that's my story. I would love to hear you guys' thoughts on this. Thanks for letting me share it.",3,1752657837.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Lately, it's been a bit quiet on the social front, and while Utrecht has loads of expat activities (which is amazing), I'm really craving more of a local vibe here in Nieuwegein.

It’s such a lovely place to live and it just feels like it needs a little more energy and community spirit to really come alive! I’m into long walks, yoga, pilates, and I’ll never say no to a good coffee and cake combo. I also really enjoy meeting new people and having meaningful convos.

I’d love to connect with others who are up for genuine conversations, creative thinking, or even just a walk and a chat. I have a feeling I’m not the only one feeling this way!

I've been tweaking my ADHD routine for years, and I finally found a system that actually helps me focus, stay calm, and keep my energy stable. I thought I'd share it here in case it helps someone else!

# ☀️ Morning Routine (ADHD-focused & natural dopamine booster)

**1. Wake up — no phone**  
First 5 minutes: I avoid all stimulation. Just water and daylight.

**2. 3–4 rounds of Wim Hof breathing**  
Each round: 30 deep breaths → exhale → hold → recovery breath  
By round 2 or 3 I feel *alive*, focused and my brain fog is gone.  
(If I skip this, my ADHD symptoms hit harder by mid-morning.)

**3. Multivitamin & Supplements**

* One high-quality **multivitamin** with methylated B-vitamins (for MTHFR risk)
* **Creatine** (5g)
* **Whey protein** with breakfast (25–30g protein)
* Sometimes: **Omega-3 EPA** or **L-Tyrosine** on tough days

**4. Protein-rich breakfast**  
Something simple but ADHD-friendly:

* 1 scoop **whey protein (also great for satiety and weight loss)**
* 2 eggs or cottage cheese
* Berries or half an avocado
* Coffee with MCT oil and cinnamon (no sugar)

**5. Movement first, thinking later**  
I **don’t do any work** until I move my body. My ADHD needs it.

# 🏋️‍♂️ Workout (about 45 min total)

* 20–30 min **cardio** (brisk walk or jump rope)
* 15–20 min **resistance training** (bodyweight or weights — just 3 sets each) This gets my dopamine and energy levels up naturally.

**6. Cold shower (optional but awesome)**  
If I’m still feeling sluggish or unmotivated, a 30s cold shower resets everything.

# 🧠 Why it works for me:

* The **Wim Hof breathing** clears my head and kills morning apathy.
* High protein + movement = dopamine without meds.
* The structure keeps me from spiraling into ADHD ""rabbit holes.""

  
About my general diet: **Low Carb.**



If anyone else has tried a similar routine or wants to build one, happy to chat!

I was obsessed with Jack, willing to become his wife and cover up his affair with his childhood sweetheart.



""I'm bringing Sophia back to the apartment tonight. You'd better disappear for a while.""



While recovering in the guest bedroom, I witnessed them enter the front door entangled, not even bothering to close the master bedroom door before they started frantically tearing at each other's clothes.



My understanding of love was pure—to love someone meant accepting everything they loved.



I was bewitched by Jack. Since I couldn't win his heart, I was content to be Mrs. Harrison in name only.



However, when that hurricane hit, I watched Jack rush to Sophia's side, holding her tightly as they fled from danger.



Meanwhile, I was crushed beneath fallen billboards, utility poles, and building debris, closing my eyes forever.



I regretted it deeply, realizing that no amount of adoration was worth more than my own life.



Given a second chance, I resolved to sever my obsession with Jack.



This time, though, he would be the one to taste regret.

————————



1

During flu season, I was burning up with fever, my mind in a haze.



It was the same in my past life. I struggled in bed for thirty-six hours, and my so-called husband Jack didn't even send a single text.



As if I were just some lifeless decoration in the apartment.



I never expected that when I opened my eyes, I'd be back at this moment in time.



Perhaps fate took pity on me, giving me a chance to start over.



The fear of being crushed by debris in a hurricane still hadn't faded. I trembled as I checked my phone.



Just like before, Jack had sent a text ten minutes ago.



""I'm bringing Sophia back to the apartment tonight. You'd better make yourself scarce for a while.""



If I remember correctly, Sophia had returned from Europe less than seventy-two hours ago.



Jack was clearly impatient, brazenly bringing her back to our marital home.



In my past life, I was too weak to escape, forced to curl up in the guest room listening to their passionate entanglement.



They probably thought the house was empty, not even bothering to restrain their voices, carelessly discarding their clothes all over the place.



""Soph, I've missed you so much. Call me darling, won't you? Just this once... come on...""



To this day, I remember how Jack, who acted cold and celibate in front of me, used such vulgar and explicit words to pleasure Sophia.But this time, I absolutely won't make the same mistake again.



In my past life, when they were passionately entangled in the bedroom, Jack's mother somehow got wind of it and showed up unexpectedly.



In that critical moment, it was me who dragged my sick body downstairs to smooth things over.



""Emma, you must keep a close eye on Jack. Although Sophia grew up with him, her family has gone bankrupt and isn't good enough for the Harrison family. You absolutely cannot let them do anything that would damage our reputation.""



Because I loved Jack in my heart, even though I knew he was upstairs naked with Sophia at that very moment, I could only muster my strength to placate Mrs. Harrison and send her home.



But this time...



Since Jack had the guts to bring someone home, he should be prepared to face his mother's fury.



This time, I won't be the scapegoat.



Despite still feeling unwell, I gritted my teeth and got up to pack my bags, ready to leave this trouble spot.



Based on my experience from my past life, Jack and Sophia would be home in about twenty minutes.



I quickly packed the essentials, then called an Uber and headed straight for the hospital.



I really did have a severe case of flu, so staying in the hospital for a few days to recover was reasonable.



As for that so-called ""home,"" I'll leave it to them to enjoy to their hearts' content.After all, I don't have any special fetish for eavesdropping on people having sex.



Once inside the car, I received a text from my bestie.



""Is your flu any better? My mom made some organic chicken soup. Want me to bring it over?""



In my past life, with Jack on my mind, I immediately turned her down.



But this time, I decided to go with the flow.



After all, having just Jack's mother catch them in the act isn't exciting enough, is it?



When everything was arranged, I was already lying in a hospital bed, silently receiving an antibiotic drip.

...

The apartment's surveillance feed was linked to my phone, allowing me to log in and monitor the situation as it unfolded.



Perhaps because in my past life I had always stayed in the guest room, my view was limited, so I never knew exactly where they indulged in their passion.



Through the surveillance cameras, I could clearly see them frantically coupling on the glass coffee table in the living room.



They even used the bouquet of flowers on the table as a prop in their lovemaking.



Good Lord, those flowers were ones I had personally selected and bought from the florist.



Disgusting...



I nearly threw up everything in my stomach.



This time, Jack's mother seemed to arrive earlier than she had in my previous life.



They hadn't even had time to move to another location when the front door swung open.



""Oh my God! How could you do such a scandalous thing! Have you no shame at all?""



Witnessing this historic scene, I almost burst out laughing.



Jack and Sophia, stark naked, were now frantically searching for clothes to cover themselves.



Just then, my best friend Lily also barged in.



She had always disliked Jack, and upon seeing this scene, she immediately understood what was happening.



""Jack Harrison, you bastard! How dare you do this behind Emma's back!""



Jack clearly hadn't expected to be caught in the act.But he still ""chivalrously"" stood in front of Sophia, shielding her. ""This has nothing to do with Sophia. Don't give her any trouble. If you have a problem, come at me.""



Good, how romantic.



""Boo hoo... Jack, how could this happen? Why did your aunt and Emma's bestie suddenly barge in?""



Sophia fake-cried while cleverly probing for information.



As expected, that birdbrain Jack took the bait immediately.



""Mom, why are you here? Did Emma tattle on me? I never thought she'd be that kind of woman...""



Before Jack could finish, his mother slapped him hard across the face.



""Don't flatter yourself by slandering Emma! She would never stoop so low. Besides, she's your lawful wife. Even if she did report your cheating, wouldn't that be perfectly justified?""



My bestie chimed in fiercely, ""Emma's so sick she can't even get out of bed. I came to bring her some chicken soup. Don't assume everyone's as cold-hearted as you!""



Jack was stunned.



""What? Emma's sick?""



He seemed to realize I might be at home, his expression turning grave.



He hurriedly pulled on his pants and rushed to my room, completely ignoring Sophia as she tried to cling to his arm.



""Jack, darling...""She tried to coax Jack upstairs with a coquettish voice, but ended up getting slapped hard by my best friend.



""Stop acting so disgustingly, seducing someone else's husband. Have you no shame?""



There were no cameras in my room, so I couldn't see Jack's expression.



But when he came back down, he was noticeably calmer.



""You don't need to team up to deceive me. Emma isn't in the bedroom at all. I bet she's just making excuses to play the victim, trying to use you to catch us red-handed.""



My best friend nearly laughed in exasperation.



""Jack, did a mule kick you in the head or something? Who would fake being sick? I'm calling her right now.""



""Go ahead. If it turns out she set this up today to frame me and get you to bully Sophia, I won't let her off easy!""

...

""Enough!"" Jack's mother could no longer contain herself. ""Your wife is sick, and your first reaction isn't concern, but suspicion that she's deceiving you. How did I give birth to such a fool!""



My best friend didn't keep them waiting long, immediately initiating a video call to me on her phone.



I quickly applied foundation to whiten my lips, then slightly messed up my hair to make myself appear more sickly and weak.



Jack heard the sound of the call connecting and, without even looking, began to accuse:



""Emma Harrison, you're getting bolder and bolder, actually pulling this sick act...""



He stopped mid-sentence as he looked at the screen, swallowing the rest of his words.



There was no denying it; I truly looked ill on the screen.



I deliberately coughed a few times, then greeted them in a feeble voice.



""Jack, what are you talking about? cough-cough... Mom and Lily, why are you at the apartment?""



""You... you're really sick? Where are you?""



Jack clearly hadn't anticipated this situation, his questions becoming stuttered.



I smiled weakly, ""In the hospital. It's nothing serious, just a bad cold. I'll be better in a few days.""Jack's mother shot her son a fierce glare. ""Emma, you silly girl. Why didn't you tell me you had such a bad cold? I could've come to take care of you.""



I exchanged pleasantries with Jack's mother, smiling. ""What's going on in the apartment? It looks like a mess in here.""



Of course it was. They'd just had passionate sex. How could the room not be in disarray?



I wanted to steer the conversation in that direction, but for some reason, Jack proactively tried to cover it up.



""Get some rest. I'll come see you tomorrow,"" he said to me, his tone almost gentle.



I laughed bitterly on the inside.



Clearly, when no one else knew, he had no qualms about mistreating me. But now that everything was out in the open, he had to compromise to save face.



At his core, he was someone who cared deeply about his image. Unable to lower himself to officially date his own niece, he chose me as a smokescreen.



I had this man all figured out now.



Having already experienced death, I no longer harbored any affection for him.



Just as my best friend took the phone, ready to chat a bit more, Sophia finally couldn't help but interject:



""Emma, how come you're sick? Is it serious?""



She swiftly leaned into the frame to inquire, deliberately exposing the hickeys on her neck.



She was hoping I'd have a hysterical meltdown, fly into a rage, and completely lose control.This way she could make Jack despise me even more, further deteriorating our relationship.



But I just smiled and said, ""Sophia's back? That's wonderful. I'm too sick to entertain you, so let your uncle keep you company!""



Then I asked her, ""What's with those red marks on your neck? Are you having an allergic reaction?""

me… should never have been in the forces, really – he just wanted to be around animals, to

work with them. And now I have robbed him of that chance…”

Nordale paused the recorder, giving Iain time to regain his composure.

Iain broke from the trance-like state in which he had been recalling the events.

“Take a break,” Nordale suggested. “Go and splash your face. I’ll arrange more coffee and

some food. Come back when you’re ready.”

Iain nodded mutely and wheeled towards the door. The hospital-issued wheelchair squeaked

constantly – a mocking reminder to the former soldier of all that had happened.

An hour later, Nordale was still sitting there, more than half-convinced that Iain had gone but

the morbid fanfare of the wheelchair’s squeaking could eventually be heard out on the

corridor, approaching the room.

The door swung open and Iain entered. “Sorry. Some prick hogged the disabled toilet for

ages,” he grumbled.

“Are you OK to continue? Or have you done as much as you can for today?”

“Let’s just push on. If I don’t tell you now…” his voice tailed off.

The implication was clear and Nordale was anxious not to miss the opportunity. He simply

O’Donnell, I: Session two.

The following morning, we were up before the birds. All of us woke prematurely, still tired,

but subconsciously, after so many years of service, resuming the watchful alertness of being

on duty. This was an operation, not a holiday.

Bryan, Richard and I prepared the equipment we anticipated that we would need - and some

extras - with regimented precision. We were ready to depart even before Marie ordered us to

wait and breakfast before setting off.

Over bacon butties and hot tea, we assured Marie that we would work faster and safer

knowing that she and Alby were safe at the cottage. It was rented for the week and, if we

had not returned or contacted her by 1800 hours on the fifth day, she was to alert the

authorities on our behalf. This provision felt vital, under the circumstances.

After farewells, we drove the jeep to the warden’s office where my brother’s expedition first

began. Somewhat to our surprise, the head ranger and two others were waiting for us.

Seeing our equipment and weapons, the ranger from the previous day was incensed. “What

do you think you’re doing?” he spluttered.

“I would have thought that was obvious,” I replied, calmly. “We’re going to find my brother.

Something you should already have been doing.”

He was about to add some comment when the chief ranger interrupted. His face and

demeanour suggested to me that he, too, had served in the forces. Although probably in his

fifties, his physique and alert expression suggested authority. “What regiment are you all

from?” he enquired.

“Royal Yorks,” I replied.

He smiled, extending a hand. “Scots Guards.”

After this momentary exchange of respect, he spoke quietly but insistently. “I am sorry that

you have had to resort to this. This is a lack of sense and duty I would not have expected

from one of my men.” He glared at the warden, whose laziness and arrogance had abruptly

drained from him. “I am going to be as fair as I can be and allow you to go in – however,

without permits or a clear notion of your path, I’ll only permit this if Alastair, here, comes with

you.” He indicated a muscular, quiet young man with sandy hair and a thick beard. “He’s

knowledgeable about the area and can radio me if there are any problems.”

I examined Alastair for a moment, noting his backpack and bivouac tent. Clearly, he was

already prepared: this was not, it seemed, up for negotiation, so I simply nodded my thanks

to the head ranger.

We set off at 0800 hours, under grey skies, into Abheis…

We entered, and within yards it felt as though we had encroached upon a different world.

Any semblance of track beneath our feet disappeared; the tree canopy seemed to close

more densely above our heads; dim light and an unnatural stillness prevailed. Silence. I

strained my ears but could hear no birdsong; the dead leaves and pine needles strewing the

earth absorbed any noise our feet might make. The air felt stale, somehow, devoid of the

freshness of healthy woodland vegetation.

“Hear that?” Richard asked.

“What?” I asked.



“Literally anything that you would expect in a forest,” Richard replied. “Something is wrong

about this place.”

Strangely, not one of us disagreed or mocked his words…

We continued walking – or at some points scrambling – over the rutted, uneven ground.

Alastair was clearly no hindrance, being well acclimatized to the rough terrain, striding with

apparent ease between the trees. I recalled my brother’s comments about the man Booth

who was with them, and his slow pace. By the sound of it, they had not covered that much

ground on a daily basis so we would hopefully catch up with them soon.

Several hours later, however, absolutely no sign they’d passed that way. We saw no traces,

no accidental scrap of litter, no footprints, no flattened plants. Come to think of it, there were

few, if any, plants. Everything seemed to be smothered under a thick layer of dust – almost

like you might imagine volcanic dust smothering the features of the landscape close to an

eruption.

After a further two hours or so of strenuous walking, midway through the afternoon, we

paused for hot coffee, sitting on and around a fallen tree in a clearing, its dead roots

crumbling and hollow.

Bryan, on edge, turned to me. “We both examined the note-book last night, Iain – you know

none of this matches what your brother said.”

We exchanged concerned glances but said no more.

“Did I hear you just tell of a note-book?” Alastair enquired of me.

I hesitated before answering, but if Alastair was now a part of this, then he was probably

entitled to know what he was getting into. “Yeah – Alby had some of it. The dog, that is,” I

explained. “But this is so different to what he described, we can’t be in the same place.”

I fished the notebook out of my pack and showed Alastair David’s description:

…cover substantially more distance than the previous day. Aibheis was proving to be a gift

that kept on giving: the vast forest was spread out before us, and birdsong echoed from

every copse and break. A small stream ran down through a narrow, deep channel through

the heathers. It truly was a privilege to be one of the first to charter this natural wilderness.

Booth was finally in his element, having identified ptarmigan, capercaillies, and even

witnessing the low swoop of a female hen harrier. Every few metres, it seemed, Booth would

pause to exclaim over plants, mosses and lichens. Given that this was only day two, I was

concerned that Booth will consider the area too important to encourage more public

access…

As Alastair read, he glanced up and looked around him at the terrain, trying to find any echo

of my brother’s description in the land around us.

“We passed a stream, right enough,” he said, “but we’ve seen no sign of life otherwise.” He

shook his head, slightly puzzled.

I, too, was puzzled. From the ranger’s station it had looked like all the rest – teeming with

spring life, shooting plants and birdsong. We’d seen villages razed to the ground with more

sense of life than this.

“Come on: let’s keep going while there is still good light,” I suggested, and we resumed our

march, single file, Bryan and I leading the way, with Richard assuming his habitual place at



the back. Unfamiliar with our procedures and feeling a sense of responsibility for Alastair, we

kept him in the middle of our group.

As we continued on our way, we were strangely quiet – not just the quiet of concentration

and focus on the task in hand, but a quietness born of unease.

“Anyone else feel that we are being watched?” Richard laughed. Then suddenly, he barked,

“Take cover!” yanking Alastair back and to one side, as an unidentified mass fell from the

tree-tops on to the ground between us. As it landed, dust and detritus billowed into the air

and we were aware of a stale, foetid smell like nothing I had ever encountered.

“What the…?”

“What is that?” Alastair asked.

We were looking at a tangle of dried hair, sinew, leathered skin and… hooves?

“The hooves are like… is that a deer?” I asked, incredulously.

Alastair stooped to examine it more closely. “Well. It was a deer. I think. But what the hell

has happened to it, I don’t know. It’s like, twisted, knotted – and that – is that – its guts?” He

pointed to where dried, leathery loops bulged through a split in the outer skin. “Just – how

did it get like that? And how did it get up there?”

We all slowly raised our eyes up the trunks of the trees towards the canopy but there was

nothing to indicate from whence the thing had fallen.

Continuing on our way, we were all rather subdued. More than once, each member of the

party peered up into the trees but we saw nothing ominous. There was little conversation,

however: we were all too locked up in our own thoughts, too caught up in unspoken

questions and speculations.

Bryan made the call to make camp: he had been monitoring the level of daylight and the

position of the sun and thought we had probably only a good hour of light left. This made

absolutely no sense for the time of year and yet was palpably true. Setting up camp was

difficult as every time we put something down, dust erupted. Pegs were hard to insert

without further choking dust being stirred up and the miasma of dirt in the air made the

dimming light even weaker.



Richard was trying to build a fire from branches. True, we had a stove to cook, but the

cheery light and warmth of a fire would please us all. Alastair’s concerns had been noted

and dismissed: we knew how to control a fire safely, we weren’t ignorant townies!

He need not have worried. Every time Richard tried to pick up a branch, it simply crumbled

into smothering dust. Alastair – not without smugness – handed out head torches from his

pack.

We ate supper and drank some whisky, which inevitably led us into discussing past exploits,

regaling Alastair with exaggerated accounts of shared adventures and misdemeanours.



“How about you, Alastair?” Richard asked after a while. “Did you never fancy the forces?”

He smiled, wryly. “Thought about it, but I got into a spot of bother with the law.” His voice

was quiet, thoughtful. “We were just daft lads on a night out. Too much ale and not enough

sense – you know how it goes.”

I think each of us nodded in agreement: there but for the grace of God…

“Anyway, after a charge of criminal damage to a rich guy’s house and a cautionary couple of

months behind bars, Gordon – the Chief Warden – took a chance on me. Never looked

back.” He downed his whisky, accepted another. “The dude whose house I damaged: turns

out he was a golf buddy of the procurator fiscal! Seems you should always check first who

you’re going to piss off, eh?” he laughed.

We joined him in that laughter and, on that cheerful note, readied ourselves to head to our

tents for the night. Bryan disappeared off a short distance to relieve himself and I made sure

all of our provisions were securely stowed away.

Bryan called out as he returned. “You need to see this. This can’t be the same one, but it

looks…” His voice tailed off, uncertainly.

“What? What are you looking at?” I asked.

“That’s the question….”

We walked over to where he was standing. As each of us turned our lamps towards the

mass on the floor, the light pooled over the dust-veiled husk of another deer. A deer

contorted into an impossible shape, its face a grimace of fear and agony, its abdomen split

and internal organs seemingly mummified.

Bryan knelt to examine it more closely, prodding at it with a stick, then turning its body over.

“Can’t see any gunshot. Can’t see any teeth marks. It’s like it’s just dried out so much it’s

split. Just seems odd, to find two like that. You’d expect the bodies to be predated,

scavenged…”

“Is that a burn mark?” Alastair asked, indicating a darker patch of skin.

“Dunno…. Never seen anything like it, to be honest,” Bryan responded.

Uneasily, we settled for the night. I don’t know about the others, but I was slow to sleep,

despite the exertions of the day.



Nordale spoke softly. “I hate to interrupt, but this mark – can you describe it to me?”

Iain shuffled in his wheelchair, adjusting his position, eyes downcast. His hand drifted,

apparently autonomously, towards his right thigh. The tremor in his hand was visible.

Nordale gazed at him steadily, his body language relaxed and unthreatening, but mentally

willing Iain to confide the truth.

Iain gulped down some coffee, now cold, and cleared his throat. “You know, I couldn’t tell

you the last time I didn’t feel exhausted. I can sleep for whole days, but…” His voice tailed

off. “The doctors can’t seem to give me any answers. Seem to think it’s psychosomatic…”

He looked off towards the corner of the room, forgetting Nordale’s question.

“The mark?” he repeated, quietly. “Tell me what it looked like, please, Iain.”



Iain, recalled to the present, answered. “About the size of a hand, I guess. Every corpse we

found had one…”

Nordale silently made a note on the pad in front of him. “An entry wound?”

“No. Just like… an imprint. Dark…”

“And you said, ‘every’ corpse, Iain. Roughly how many?”

Iain turned an anguished gaze towards Nordale. “Every…”",1,1752656733.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.99,False

0531 Hours

State Radio Building, Central District

You weren’t even supposed to be stationed in Holsord.

Your unit—a logistics support detachment—was transferred from the southern border only a week ago. Officially for training. Unofficially, it was because someone high up needed “reliable men” close to the capital.

Reliable meant quiet. Loyal. Trained not just to follow orders, but to understand them without explanation.

On the night of the coup, you and fourteen others were roused without fanfare. A lieutenant with a dry voice read orders from a folded slip of paper. Secure the national radio station. Do not damage infrastructure. Use force only if necessary. Transmission must be uninterrupted.

There was no glory in it. No firefight. A few station guards surrendered without a fight. The senior technician was out sick. The announcer—who usually read the morning news—was nowhere to be found. One of the producers was drunk under a desk. The rest had fled before the second truck even pulled in.

Inside the studio, your boots echoed across the wooden floors as you passed smashed glass and half-smoked cigarette trays. A rifle butt silenced the alarm bell at the front desk. The transmission room was still live, glowing with warm tubes and red dials.

You and the others stood awkwardly beneath the studio lights, rifles in hand, not quite sure if the moment had come or passed you by.

“Where’s the script?” someone asked.

“There isn’t one,” another replied.

“We wait for Luderin’s speech, then—”

“Wait? For what? The city’s going to start waking up in an hour. We need to say something now.”

The air was thick with cigarette smoke and uncertainty. The men shifted, some fidgeting with their belts or helmets. A corporal muttered a prayer under his breath. Another stared at the blinking red light above the studio glass like it might explode.

You weren’t an officer. You weren’t even the senior enlisted man in the room. But someone remembered your voice. You’d read poems at barracks gatherings. Studied public speaking during university. Carried yourself like someone who should be listened to.

“Let him do it,” said one of the corporals. “He’s good with words.”

You stepped behind the microphone in your uniform, sweat beginning to cling to the collar of your undershirt. The room behind the glass quieted. A signal technician adjusted the levels. Another checked the broadcast line. The corporal gave a nod. The red light blinked on.

Your heart pounded—not with fear, but with clarity. You could feel it in your ribs: this was the real moment, not the marching, not the rifles.

This was the coup.

“Greci Sordland wes ollamort bise Freci.”

(Glory to Sordland, ever at peace.)

“These words, from our ancient anthem, remind us of who we are—and why we must stand together now.”

“Good morning, citizens of Sordland.”

Your voice was low, calm. Not triumphant. Not panicked. Controlled.

“At 04:47 this morning, elements of the Sordish Armed Forces assumed operational control over the organs of government, in accordance with emergency directives issued by General Eduard Luderin, Commander of the National Army.”

No stutter. No filler. You spoke slowly. Deliberately. Your voice filled homes, cafes, barracks, taxicabs. Somewhere, a child stopped eating his bread. Somewhere else, a mother turned up the dial. Somewhere in the capital, a frightened minister dropped his coffee.

“This decisive action was taken to prevent the further deterioration of our Republic under the failed stewardship of President Artor Wisci and his administration. For years, our homeland has suffered—through corruption, division, and the erosion of national unity.”

National unity.

The words hadn’t been written by Luderin. They came from your own mouth. From your own mind. And no one stopped you.

“Foreign ideologies—Marxist agitation, socialist unrest—have infiltrated our institutions and turned brother against brother. President Wisci’s Republic, born in the chaos of the Century of Revolutions, has surrendered our borders and our traditions.”

Your voice spilled through homes in Narbel, post offices in Deyr, officer mess halls in the mountains of Gelsord. Everywhere, people stopped what they were doing. Some stood. Some clenched fists. Others felt an old, quiet dread in their chests—the kind passed down from grandparents who remembered other coups, other early mornings.

“The people have waited for leadership. The time for waiting is over.”

Behind you, in the sound room, the lieutenant was no longer blinking. He was frozen, his mouth slightly open.

One of the privates swallowed hard. The others stood still—not saluting, not relaxed, but suspended. Listening.

“This is not the end of democracy. This is a safeguard. A correction. A purification—so that our descendants may live under laws worthy of every Sordish.”

“The Provisional Military Council, under General Luderin, remains committed to civil order and national renewal. Essential services will continue uninterrupted. All citizens are urged to remain calm and remain in their homes. Curfew details will follow.”

You imagined a line of soldiers securing Parliament. A truck pulling up to the Ministry of Justice. The silence on the phones in the presidential residence. The faces behind curtains.

“The City of Holsord itself—Heart of Sordland—is not immune to division. We must reclaim our heritage: one people, one nation, one leader.”

“The transition is temporary. Order will be restored. The constitution will be revised to reflect the will of the people and the realities of our time. There will be no tolerance for sabotage, sedition, or foreign interference.”

Somewhere in the Ministry, a junior official locked his office door and began burning documents. At a military base in the north, a major exhaled, his orders now confirmed by radio. At the edge of town, an old man remembered 1859, and wept without knowing why.

“Loyalty belongs to the homeland, not to ideology. Sordland is not broken—Sordland has been reclaimed. Sordland is reborn.”

“Further statements from military leadership will be issued shortly.”

“Until then: remain vigilant. Remain faithful. Always watching, always ready.”

“The morning will come. Victory is near.”

“Greci Sordland.”

And your name?

Never mentioned.

Just a private. A voice. A vessel.

But the people remembered. Not your rank or your face, but the tone. The way you sounded calm when everything else was cracking open. You didn’t fire a shot. You didn’t storm a building.

But your words made it real.

And when the war was over, when the constitution was buried, and the flags changed—you already had a following. They didn’t even know your name yet. But they would.

I look at the dating world and the type of society we live in and I just find the whole environment to be so vapid. It feels like eating a bowl of sugary cereal in the morning when you don't have time to cook a full meal.   
  
You pour the milk and the cereal and proceed to eat. Each spoonful satiating some of your hunger and while the flavors are sweet there's no depth and no complexity. A clear product of convenience that boils down to hitting just enough hunger and having just enough flavor to make you deem it acceptable. Each swallow and chew is more dull and less gratifying than the last but rejoice there are countless variations of boxed up, processed sugar and wheat for you to try until you find one you like. 

Don't worry no negative consequences here. You definitely wont find yourself crashing in 4 hours from the overly refined food. Also if you do crash and find yourself unable to focus on work and lacking time because of it the option of cereal takes almost no time at all. 

  
I think back to one of my favorite breakfast meals which is lamb rack, over-easy eggs, sourdough toast, fresh squeezed orange juice, and wilted spinach with cherry tomatoes. I normally start with the lamb and bite into it. There's varying texture, herb and umami flavors from the meat and seasoning, aromatics that tease my nose and something deeply gratifying about pulling all of the meat from the bone. I find myself relaxing as the protein satiates me deeply and the aromatics, flavor, and textures fill me with pride from a job well done preparing this lamb. I decide to move to the wilted spinach and tomatoes which have a mix of earthy and sweet flavors and a bit of carmelization on them. The inner moist sections of the tomatoes fill my mouth with a refreshing cleanse washing away yolk and fat from the lamb and eggs. The sourdough pairs beautifully as a new texture something more bland and an amazing cleanup to the runny yolks on my plate. Each bite fills me with pride, micronutrients, and a blend of flavors, textures, and smells that make me desire the next bite even more. Finally, I'm full in a way that doesn't just leave me done eating but satisfied with my choices, the results, and the effort expended.   
  
This feels like an good analogy for the love I want. While I know I am young and there is love out there for me I find myself resentful of apps that seek to sum me up to a base list of attributes and personality quirks. I find myself put off by people that would tell themselves that love is something that can be filtered and refined like oil in an automated processed. This app doesn't know that I wrote small poems about my partner when I'm on break at work. This app doesn't know that I make sure there's Dr Pepper at home every day because my partner likes it in her coffee and the sheepish smile she makes as she pours it into her coffee melts my heart. It doesn't know that I have the dates of voicemails she left me memorized because when work or life hits me really hard I pull them up and listen to 10 seconds of her telling me she loves and misses me and I remember how every hard moment of life is worth it for the future we're building together. 

I can't stand this culture. I can't stand being some number on an app. I can't stand the idea of being someone's ""best option""; a pure circumstance that could change at any moment. I've spend my whole career and whole life investing deeply. I make great money and am a highly respected person in my field for the sheer fact that I continued to invest in ideas others deemed hard or fruitless in rain and shine over the course of a decade. I want a love that is tender, devoted, intentional, and not simply an impulsive choice someone made because loneliness got the best of them as they sipped wine watching reruns on Netflix. 

I want a love story worth writing about and I don't know how long it will take to find that. Deep down the  arduous task of finding it and the reality that it could all shatter in my very hands again fills me with sorrow and despair.... If it all ends I will once again be left with the countless pages of sad story and the shattered pieces of my heart. I'm not sure if that's something I can do again.... but I do know that cereal isn't going to do me any good over the long term. There's no need to pass me a spoon.

It’s good to change the scenery here and there. While my mind is buried in Excel-Spreadsheets. My phone starts to buzz, its one quick vibration. I look at my cracked screen, it’s a SMS from an unknown number. Probably one of these scam messages telling me I inherited millions of dollars from a Nigerian prince. I put my phone away, being lost in Excel. 

My gut is telling me, I should read the message. It’s one of the situations where your instincts take over. The message reads.

“You’re not supposed to be alive.”

Sad, I’m not a millionaire. I put my phone away and I start to go back to my work. Again, this feeling inside me. This message feels like a warning and not like a scam. I scan my surroundings. In the shop right now only is the older barista. I know him, can’t be him. There is also a young woman reading a book. She looked at me when I entered the shop. No, can’t be her, from where could she have my number? 

Outside of the shop is a guy in a black suit. He was on his phone the whole time since I started to work. His back is turned to me. He has a black duffle bag with him.

I take some deep breaths, I should not get rattled by a bad joke. Probably some teens think it’s funny. Maybe it was really the girl. You never know, kids these days know how to use tech. Back to Excel. I close my laptop. My chest tightens up. My mouth tastes like the sahara. I will leave. My phone buzzes again. New message. Same unknown number.

Me and my girlfriend are going to Krakow from 4th–15th August, but realistically we’ll only be spending money from the 5th–14th because we arrive really late on the 4th and fly back on the 15th.

Flights and hotel are fully paid for, so this £2,350 is just our spending money for while we’re there.

About us:
	•	We don’t drink much — maybe one big night out where we’ll go clubbing or to a bar, but that’s it.
	•	We don’t really do breakfasts out — we’ll just have cereal in the apartment.
	•	We want to have a nice evening meal every night — sometimes fancy, sometimes more casual.
	•	For lunch we’ll eat out most days, but not every day — sometimes it’ll just be something cheap or quick.
	•	We want to visit Auschwitz, the Salt Mines, and the thermal baths.
	•	We’re not planning to shop for clothes or souvenirs while we’re there.
	•	On the arrival and departure days, we’ll just need an Uber to/from the airport, no spending otherwise.

So basically this £2,350 needs to cover:
	•	Lunch and dinner for 10 days
	•	Day trips/entry fees for Auschwitz, Salt Mines, Thermal Baths
	•	Ubers, local transport, snacks, coffees etc
	•	One night out with drinks and a strip club
	•	Any little extras

That works out to about £235 per day for both of us together.

Does this sound realistic for a comfortable trip in Krakow? We want to enjoy ourselves and eat well, but we don’t need to be extravagant every single meal.

Would really appreciate any advice — especially if you’ve been recently and know the prices!

Thanks a lot 😊

1m17cjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoTravel/comments/1m17cjv/gbase_a_slice_of_jdm_heaven/,G.Base - A slice of JDM Heaven!,"Following my recent JDM rental experience post, a fellow redditor mentioned a place called G.base which immediately caught my attention. As a long time fan of Best Motoring and Hot Version, even before moving to Japan, I was surprised I hadn’t heard of it. If you’re into proper JDM performance culture, you’ve likely seen those iconic videos, and chances are you’ll recognise Keiichi Tsuchiya, aka the Drift King or “Dori Dori.” Even if the name doesn’t ring a bell, you’ve probably seen that green racing suit and helmet. I knew I had to go, as soon as I heard about it... so off I went!

While the experience was fresh in my mind, I thought I better write this up in case anyone finds it useful in the future.

I visited on a weekday afternoon after finishing work early in Akihabara. A 15-minute train ride to Rokuchō Station, followed by a 12-minute walk, and I was there. It’s very easy to get to and honestly, it’s probably better to take the train given Tokyo traffic (don’t drive in Central Tokyo is my eternal advice). 

Regrettably, I was so excited to walk in that I forgot to snap a photo of the shop from the outside... So I attached one from their website, which looks pretty much exactly as it did on the day. 

I’d previously visited Max Orido’s shop in Yokohama and expected something similar, but G.base had quite a different vibe. Both are similar in size, but while Orido’s shop feels more modern, G.base has a classier, more curated atmosphere somehow. There were a total of five cars on display, and a cafe serving genuinely good coffee.   

On display was Tsuchiya’s green bonnet AE86. I genuinely thought it was a replica because it looked so pristine. But Jomoto-san, the shop manager (ex-Spoon Type One manager, whom I met a few years back), confirmed it’s the real deal. One of the cleanest AE86s I’ve ever seen.    

Next to it was a full carbon fibre AE86 race car. The level of craftsmanship on this was simply insane - it has to be seen to be believed. They also had a SARD GR Supra complete car, which I’d never seen before and didn’t even know existed! Apparently, it had just been sold by G.base. So if you're in Japan and looking for something unique, who knows... you might end up driving one home. 

Upstairs was a spotless R34 GT-R, tastefully modified, and out front was DK’s FL5 so Honda fans, take note. 

Beyond the cars, there were also art pieces for sale, DK-branded Bride bucket seats, KW suspension barricades, G.base T-shirts, DK gloves, Tec-Art’s memorabilia, and even a Fujitsubo saucepan. Yes, really. Part of me wishes I had bought it.

I had a quick chat with Jomoto-san who told me G.base also serves as an event space, with rotating themed displays and upcoming events. So it seems there’s definitely more to come from this place. 

As I was leaving, an R32 GTR pulled into the forecourt. The driver turned out to be the guide from Drivers Lounge, who I had met previously, just back from a tour (didn't know they did tours to/from here too, must be new since I last dealt with them). I chatted with him and his customer for a few minutes, and it reminded me of how I felt when I first arrived in Japan and drove my first JDM car. It's always a great feeling to see someone enjoying something you're also passionate about so much.

I took some pictures of the cars and layout, in case anyone else is interested, and I hope this helps visiting JDM fans add more to their overall experience - but honestly, the camera cannot do these cars justice!

Would I recommend G.base? Absolutely. If you appreciate authentic JDM culture, it’s a must-visit when in Japan. Take a couple of hours away from central Tokyo, drop by, grab some merch, and enjoy a cup of coffee.

About 3 weeks ago, i met a girl online. It was super casual and things went fast because i think nagclick lang din kasi kami na spontaneous parehas ang g naman sa mga bagay bagay.

I'm the type na hindi masyadong comfy na nakikipag getting to know each other online lang, parang feel ko it's different kapag physically kayo nagkkwentuhan and/or nagtatanungan about each other (if u check my acct, i had a previous encounter also w someone u met online na ayaw makipagmeet because there are things daw that she still has to consider etc, but anyway this is a diff story haahah)

So this person, let's call her J -- was super chill to talk to, to the point na sa super gaan ng vibe, just 1 day after we started talking, i jokingly asked her if she wanted to go to dangwa. Di ko inexpect na mag g-g sya, so when she agreed, as someone who hasnt been out in the dating / talking scene for soooo long, sobrang kabado ako HAHAH kabado because it's the first time since the pandemic na i'll really meet w/ someone i dont personally know para makipagkilala and mag chill

Fast forward, natuloy naman, naging sponty lang that day, nakarating pa kami sa ibang lugar to get food and coffee, at hinatid ko pa sya somewhere na mas convenient sakanya para makauwi.

That time, it was clear sa head ko that i was just there to gain a new friend or casually talk to people. Medjo nasa utak ko parin kasi during this time yung girl na nakausap ko before (again, just check my acct hahaha).

Things were ok, our conversations werent the 24/7 type of talk but more on checking each other kung kamusta, how our day went, what we were gna do for the day. Then came a second meet haha it was either go around an area near me, or chill at my place. No expectations and all, I just enjoyed talking to someone new -- may onting landi sa chat but it wasn't purely landian. During the second meet, we decided to stay in. We talked for hours while watching a movie, i got to know more personal things abt her, ganun din naman sya sakin. After that day, i felt genuinely happy because for the first time in a very long time, merong nag effort to meet me (imagine going all the way from her place to manila then commuting to my place in qc to meet). Will not disclose what happened that day in detail, but in short, we got more comfy sa isat isa.

Our chat continued daily, until last week I invited her to go out again. I only planned to meeet her once bec busy rin ako sa work, but she was the one who said something like ""i'll go to u on wed, u go to me on fri"" and tbh as a person who is easily attached (+ wala ngang kausap ang jowa for a very long time), amininin ko sa sarili ko na kinilig ako sa fact that again, she's making an effort to meet me and get to know me despite our schedule.

On Friday, I went to meet her super quickly because I had a flight nung gabi. I jusf felt like I wanted to see her kahit hassle sya since my day was so full last friday. Di ko alam, baka gut feel or anything kaya pinush ko talaga syang makita before I left, but to cut things short -- nung pauwi nako nitong Monday, bigla nalang syang di nagchchat or super tagal na magreply. Medjo kinabahan ako at first because she isnt usually like that, two things agad ang naisip ko, either 1 baka may something bad or emergency, or 2 igghost na nya ako. but yun, unfortunately when i asked if she still wanted to continue talking, sabi nya that she things we shouldnt continue na bec she isnt looking for snything serious rn, but she also mentioned na during the time we spent w/ e/o, she really tried to get to know me pero she realized she isnt ready yet because she still enjoys her freedom + being single 

I was really hoping it wasnt #2 because while i was abroad, i came to realize na baka im starting to get interested in this person. Na baka after so many failed usap and landi, baka may progress here kasi ngayon ko lang din nafeel na medjo narereciprocate ung energy/time/affection na binibigay ko, kaso wala hahaha another failed trial (pero this time iba yung tama ng sakit sakin)

I know naman that pag nasa talking stage malaking malaking chance na magghosg ka nalang kr di matutuloy, but i just cant share this to other people kaya baka meron kayong maiaadvice.

1. how can i change myself and yung pagiging madali kong maattach?
2. should i still try to talk to this person and say that maybe we could stay as friends first para no pressure sakanya na mawawala ung freedom nya?
3. weird/baliw question, but is there any way para makaiwas sa mga failed talking stage HAHAHAHA ",1,1752654903.0,WLW_PH,2,1.0,False

But there has to be some good in this world right?, so I'm on here to see what happens.

what I'm looking to gain from this is a close friend who checks up on me if they're worried about me or I'm on their mind. 

The end goal for me is meeting in person after talking for a few months and doing stuff friends should do. Even if it's basic stuff like meeting in a coffee shop.

Obviously I'd need help with that because of my disability Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy but i can't just sit here sulking over my social life when i know I can do something. 

Anyway I'm based in Warwick, moved here 5 years ago. 

my hobbies are: Buying PC components and building computers, Video Editing, Music, Watching Crime Drama tv shows, Dramas, Medical Dramas, Gaming.

I analyzed 5,000 Tinder conversations (with permission) to find patterns in what works and what instantly kills attraction.

**The brutal stats:**

* 67% of conversations die after the first exchange
* 23% more die after message 3
* Only 10% make it past the first day
* Less than 2% result in actual dates

**Why conversations die (ranked by frequency):**

**1. The Interview Trap (43% of failed conversations)** Guy: ""Hey! How's your day going?"" Girl: ""Good, you?"" Guy: ""Good! What do you do for work?"" Girl: ""I'm a teacher. You?"" Guy: ""Cool! I work in marketing. Do you like it?"" *Dies here*

**Why it fails:** You're conducting a job interview, not creating attraction. Boring questions get boring answers.

**2. The Compliment Bomb (31% of failures)** Starting with ""You're gorgeous"" or ""Beautiful pics"" immediately puts you in the ""desperate"" category with the other 200 guys who said the same thing.

**3. The Pen Pal Problem (18% of failures)** Guys who text for weeks without suggesting a meetup. She loses interest because you seem either scared or not actually interested in dating.

**What Actually Works:**

**The 3-Message Rule:**

* Message 1: Playful observation about her profile
* Message 2: Build on her response with humor/story
* Message 3: Suggest meeting up

**Examples of winning openers:**

* ""I see you're into hiking. Question: are you a 'sunrise hike' person or a 'let's start at noon' person?""
* ""Your dog looks like it judges people. Does it approve of your matches?""
* ""I noticed you mentioned tacos. This is important: hard or soft shell? Our compatibility depends on this.""

**The Psychology Behind Why This Works:**

* Shows you actually read her profile
* Creates a conversation thread to build on
* Demonstrates personality immediately
* Gives her something interesting to respond to

**Conversation Flow That Gets Dates:**

1. **Playful opener** (not a question)
2. **Build on her response** with story/humor
3. **Suggest meeting:** ""We should continue this debate over coffee""
4. **Set concrete plans** immediately

**The Biggest Mistake:** Trying to build attraction through text. Your goal isn't to make her fall for you over messages - it's to intrigue her enough to meet in person.

**Red Flags That Kill Conversations:**

* Asking about her work in the first 3 messages
* Giving generic compliments
* Responding immediately to every message
* Writing paragraphs when she sends short replies
* Asking ""how was your day"" (unless you're already dating)

**The 24-Hour Rule:** If you haven't suggested meeting within 24 hours, your chances drop by 73%. She matched with you because she was interested in dating, not texting.

**What changed my success rate from 2% to 34%:** Treating conversations like they're happening at a bar, not over email. Be playful, suggest meeting quickly, and remember - she already swiped right on you.

I also started getting objective feedback on my conversation style through tools like **10XSwipe** (which I actually ended up joining the team for because I was so impressed with their analysis).

1m1799l,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1m1799l/gbase_a_slice_of_jdm_heaven/,G.Base - A slice of JDM Heaven!,"Following my recent JDM rental experience post, a fellow redditor mentioned a place called G.base which immediately caught my attention. As a long time fan of Best Motoring and Hot Version, even before moving to Japan, I was surprised I hadn’t heard of it. If you’re into proper JDM performance culture, you’ve likely seen those iconic videos, and chances are you’ll recognise Keiichi Tsuchiya, aka the Drift King or “Dori Dori.” Even if the name doesn’t ring a bell, you’ve probably seen that green racing suit and helmet. I knew I had to go, as soon as I heard about it... so off I went!

While the experience was fresh in my mind, I thought I better write this up in case anyone finds it useful in the future.

I visited on a weekday afternoon after finishing work early in Akihabara. A 15-minute train ride to Rokuchō Station, followed by a 12-minute walk, and I was there. It’s very easy to get to and honestly, it’s probably better to take the train given Tokyo traffic (don’t drive in Central Tokyo is my eternal advice). 

Regrettably, I was so excited to walk in that I forgot to snap a photo of the shop from the outside... So I attached one from their website, which looks pretty much exactly as it did on the day. 

I’d previously visited Max Orido’s shop in Yokohama and expected something similar, but G.base had quite a different vibe. Both are similar in size, but while Orido’s shop feels more modern, G.base has a classier, more curated atmosphere somehow. There were a total of five cars on display, and a cafe serving genuinely good coffee.   

On display was Tsuchiya’s green bonnet AE86. I genuinely thought it was a replica because it looked so pristine. But Jomoto-san, the shop manager (ex-Spoon Type One manager, whom I met a few years back), confirmed it’s the real deal. One of the cleanest AE86s I’ve ever seen.    

Next to it was a full carbon fibre AE86 race car. The level of craftsmanship on this was simply insane - it has to be seen to be believed. They also had a SARD GR Supra complete car, which I’d never seen before and didn’t even know existed! Apparently, it had just been sold by G.base. So if you're in Japan and looking for something unique, who knows... you might end up driving one home. 

Upstairs was a spotless R34 GT-R, tastefully modified, and out front was DK’s FL5 so Honda fans, take note. 

Beyond the cars, there were also art pieces for sale, DK-branded Bride bucket seats, KW suspension barricades, G.base T-shirts, DK gloves, Tec-Art’s memorabilia, and even a Fujitsubo saucepan. Yes, really. Part of me wishes I had bought it.

I had a quick chat with Jomoto-san who told me G.base also serves as an event space, with rotating themed displays and upcoming events. So it seems there’s definitely more to come from this place. 

As I was leaving, an R32 GTR pulled into the forecourt. The driver turned out to be the guide from Drivers Lounge, who I had met previously, just back from a tour (didn't know they did tours to/from here too, must be new since I last dealt with them). I chatted with him and his customer for a few minutes, and it reminded me of how I felt when I first arrived in Japan and drove my first JDM car. It's always a great feeling to see someone enjoying something you're also passionate about so much.

I'm not sure if I can add pics on this subreddit, but I took some pictures of the cars and layout, in case anyone else is interested, and I hope this helps visiting JDM fans add more to their overall experience.

Would I recommend G.base? Absolutely. If you appreciate authentic JDM culture, it’s a must-visit when in Japan. Take a couple of hours away from central Tokyo, drop by, grab some merch, and enjoy a cup of coffee.

Okay, let's be real for a sec. We've all been there: scrolling through Insta, drooling over that perfect designer bag/jacket/dress... then you click the link and nearly choke on your coffee seeing the price tag. Seriously?! 

That exact frustration is why I started r/FashionCopy! I'm obsessed with finding amazing-looking pieces that don't require taking out a second mortgage. You know, those magical items that capture the vibe, the silhouette, the it-factor of the high-end stuff, but for a fraction of the cost. Finding a killer dupe feels like winning the lottery! 

But let's also be honest: not all dupes are created equal. We've all probably fallen for that super cheap online ad promising ""exact copy!"" only to receive... well, something that looks like it was sewn together by a blindfolded squirrel. Been there, regretted that purchase.

So, r/FashionCopy fam, let's kick things off! I wanna hear YOUR stories:

1.Your Holy Grail Dupe: What's the BEST fashion copy you've ever found? What was it copying (bag, shoes, dress, etc.)? Where'd you snag it? And crucially – how close is it really? (Bonus points if you have pics! Comparison shots are GOLD )

2.The Epic Fail: We learn from mistakes! Share your WORST dupe disaster. What went wrong? Misleading pics? Terrible quality? Fell apart after one wear? Spare no details, we need the warning!

3.The Hunt Is On: Are you currently on the prowl for a dupe of something specific? Describe it! Maybe the hive mind can help track it down.

4.Dupe Philosophy: Where do you stand? Are you all about the look regardless of the label? Do you care about materials? Is it about sustainability and avoiding fast fashion or purely budget-driven? No judgment here!

Why I made this place: Fashion should be fun and expressive, not gatekept by insane prices. I believe you can look incredible without emptying your bank account. This sub is for sharing finds, warn

Ground Rules (keeping it Reddit-friendly & positive): 
•  No direct links to counterfeit goods (illegal fakes with fake logos). We're talking about inspiration pieces, look-alikes, or alternatives that capture the style without infringing trademarks. Think ""vibe copy"" or ""designer-inspired,"" not fake Rolexes.  
•  Be Kind & Respectful: Everyone's budget and style journey are different. Zero tolerance for shaming someone's choices or budget.  •  Credit Where Possible: If you know the original designer/style you're copying, mention it! It helps others understand the reference.  
•  Transparency is Key: If you're sharing a find, be honest about quality, fit, and where it falls short of the original. We value real reviews!  
•  No Spam/Self-Promo: This isn't a place for brands to shill. Genuine user finds and discussions only!   

Alright, who's got the first amazing find or cautionary tale? I'll start in the comments! Let's build this community into the ultimate spot for savvy, stylish shoppers! ",1,1752654493.0,FashionCopy,0,1.0,False

Or fragrance houses that lean towards this type of formula

I have a very specific scent (or scent profile) in my head. And I hope it exists in real life 



I think this is a secret that makes fragrances *addictive*, instead of just smelling *nice*

There's a reason why store bought sweets strategically have a substantial amount of salt in them, they're designed to be not just sweet and delicious, but *addictive.* It makes it incredibly stimulating to the brain and it makes you crave it, and prevents you from the taste fatigue, or specifically sweetness fatigue.   


Also, you know how coffee itself is bitter and just inherently not something you’d call *delicious*?

Now imagine you have milk, with sugar and vanilla - all very creamy, smooth, sweet, fragrant things.  
But then you add coffee - the *not delicious* thing - and instead of bringing down the deliciousness level, it makes it 1000% more delicious.



That’s what I want in a fragrance. Not these notes, this was just a metaphor!

But I want something very very specific

I think I want the *delicious* part to come from maybe white florals (I’m addicted to that scent), maybe sweetened by vanilla or amber, or something musky, even molecular. Something clean, cold, intoxicating (maybe it’s a subjective perception but to me white florals, musks, molecular scents are all: clean, cold, intoxicating/addictive)



  
But nothing warm or spicy like cinnamon (I hate this note in fragrances).  
Also nothing fruity or jammy, like you often get that fruityness with leathery/oud scents, like the Tuscan Leather DNA, which I’m not really into.

No booziness either



And I want the not delicious part be something like leather or tobacco, maybe not as stinky as oud (but it can be, if it’s still smooth!), not animallic/BO. Could be smoke, but not BBQ



So overall intoxicating, smooth, alluring, delicious, but it’s equally balanced out by the bitterness, the darkness, fierceness. Almost confrontational, but still balanced and ellegant. 



A bit on a colder, cleaner side, as opposed to when you have these warm, cozy, spicy, cinammony fragrances - this is what I don’t want! And unfortunately this is what I come across the most often, when it comes to this type of complex balanced fragrances.



And I want it to be a niche fragrance, but not the weird or experimental side of niche. More conventionally alluring, luxurious. 

  
I can really smell this fragrance so clearly in my head but I haven’t come across it yet in real life. When something could be close to this, it’s usually ruined by cinammonyness or fruityness



Are there maybe houses that have this type of formula, where all fragrances while being conventionally delicious, alluring, intoxicating, they all have this dark side to them, this *not delicious* flavour? I can think of Amouage, Histoires de Parfums, maybe even Le Labo, but Le Labo is a bit something different. ",1,1752654003.0,fragrance,4,0.67,False
