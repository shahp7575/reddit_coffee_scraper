As a developer and a lifelong fan, I am disgusted by the idea that men enjoy this kind of content. It is simply not true. I made this petition very similar to the recent success many, many years ago. This petition was targeted more towards the release of Cyberpunk 2077, a video game that features virtual reality sex work. The new Netflix video streaming adaptation involves young teenagers who distribute this kind of content illegally in the show. Not only are they disrespecting women to the farthest extent of virtual reality possible, but now they are involving children too. I hope that it is not too late. I recently did an interview with a surveyor who contacted me through the change.org platform. This restored my faith in the petition, but it is yet to receive a substantial amount of signatures.

Bring Coffee. You'll need it.

The whole way through the showy only thought was ""I cannot wait to write a review about this"". I'm not usually one to write reviews but this has impelled me to.

Mocked Christianity in the opening scene so that left a bad taste in my mouth from the very start.

Script was awful, ZERO substance. (It did follow the original story line which I can appreciate) but the writers need to do better.

The SONGWRITING...Cover your ears, I'f you're someone who appreciates musicality in a musical or someone who is musically adept, AVOID this show. I wanted to leave during the interval but pushed through...I should've just left. I wouldn't go again if it was free...or if I was paid to go. Severely humourless. jokes were very much unfunny, script was bad, music was terrible. For some reason, almost every song was sung at an ear damaging key, beginning to end. Choreography, also terrible. You have talented dancers, utilise their talent - this was a visual representation of mockery. (mocking the dancers).

The Actors did great. They did their job. My complaints are purely production and script based.

I'd assume that those who wrote the songs for this musical, aren't song writers, and if they are - need to go revise or redirect their career. It was passionless.

Parents, watch Mean Girls the movie before you take your young children here. Plenty of X jokes.

I LOVE musicals and the Music in musicals, how catchy, musically iridescent, and well written they commonly are. This was a disappointment and encouraged me to not watch musicals in theatre that aren't originally musicals, as I feel it encourages writers to be lazy. It really isn't hard to write a good catchy song. Especially for musicals.

If you want a recommendation of a Musial based off of a movie, The devil wears Prada was striking, incredibly choreographed and so well thought through and written. A shame I can't say the same for Mean girls.

One obstacle is that over the past few years I developed a *crippling* fear of being out when the sun is out. Afraid of being seen in the sun, afraid of being looked at in the light. Additionally, afraid of sun exposure and potentially getting skin cancer or skin damage, but that‚Äôs not the biggest concern. Sounds valid, but it‚Äôs miserable. I grew up in desert & beach areas, & as a kid I was only happy under the sun. I always become depressed during winter. I crave the sun on my skin. I crave the warm soak of it on my legs and arms and my freezing hands and feet. I want to lay on a rock like a lizard. I wish I could just say screw it, and just go lay in the sun for hours. It would feel good on my poor joints. If I get skin damage, I get skin damage. If someone sees me, they see me. Despite all the negative effects and risks, the phobia is infinitely worse.

**By Jacob**

Ever been halfway through a big game or your favorite show, only for your stream to freeze at the worst possible moment? Yeah, me too. I‚Äôve spent *way* too much time staring at buffering circles, scrambling to find a working link, or‚Äîworst of all‚Äîdealing with customer support that vanishes faster than a free trial.

That‚Äôs why I went on a mission: to find the [best IPTV service](http://iptvgear.site) that *actually* delivers on its promises in 2025. No fluff, no fake reviews‚Äîjust real performance. And after testing over a dozen providers, one name kept rising to the top: **IPTVGEAR**.

# Why You Should Trust Me (And Why IPTVGEAR Stands Out)

As someone who‚Äôs cut the cable cord years ago, I‚Äôve seen it all‚Äîshady IPTV services that disappear overnight, bloated channel lists with half-dead streams, and ""premium"" providers that charge an arm and a leg for mediocrity. But [**IPTVGEAR**](http://iptvgear.site)**?** It‚Äôs the first service that made me think, *""Okay, this is how streaming should actually work.""*

Here‚Äôs the deal: If you‚Äôre tired of:

* Missing the big game because your stream crashed
* Paying for 10,000 channels but only using 50
* Dealing with robotic (or nonexistent) customer service
* Shelling out for cable when you only watch a few things

‚Ä¶then this review is for you.

# What Makes IPTVGEAR the Best IPTV Provider for 2025?

A lot of services claim to be the **""best IPTV,""** but IPTVGEAR backs it up with:  
‚úî **Zero buffering, even during peak hours** (Super Bowl Sunday? Handled.)  
‚úî **18,000+ live channels**‚Äîsports, news, international, PPV, you name it  
‚úî **Works on Firestick, Android, iOS, Smart TVs** (set up in minutes)  
‚úî **Real 24/7 human support**‚Äîno bots, just quick fixes  
‚úî **No price surprises**‚Äîtransparent, budget-friendly plans

# What‚Äôs Coming in This Review

I‚Äôve been using IPTVGEAR daily for the past six months, so this isn‚Äôt some quick first impression. I‚Äôll break down:

* **Performance**‚ÄîDoes it *really* stream without lag?
* **Channel selection**‚ÄîWill you actually find what you want?
* **Ease of use**‚ÄîTech-friendly or grandma-approved?
* **Customer support**‚ÄîDo they actually help, or just ghost you?
* **Cost**‚ÄîIs it worth ditching cable for good?

By the end, you‚Äôll know exactly whether **IPTVGEAR is the best IPTV service for your needs**‚Äîor if you should keep looking.

# The Best IPTV Provider for 2025: Stream Smarter, Not Harder

# Main Content

**By Jacob** 

Alright, let‚Äôs get real for a second‚Äîhow many times have you settled for a crappy IPTV service just because you didn‚Äôt know any better? I get it. I‚Äôve been there. You sign up, excited to ditch cable, only to spend the next month dealing with buffering, dead channels, and customer support that ghosts you faster than a bad Tinder date.

Well, I‚Äôm here to save you the headache. After testing over a dozen IPTV services (yes, I willingly subjected myself to the chaos), I‚Äôve found the **best IPTV provider for 2025**‚Äîone that actually delivers on its promises. **IPTVGEAR.**

Now, before you roll your eyes and think, *""Here comes another ‚Äòbest IPTV service‚Äô claim,""* hear me out. This isn‚Äôt just hype. I‚Äôve been using IPTVGEAR for six straight months, and I‚Äôve put it through every possible test‚ÄîSunday Night Football marathons, overseas streaming, binge-watching 4K movies at 2 AM. And guess what? It hasn‚Äôt failed me yet.

So, let‚Äôs break down exactly why [IPTVGEAR is the best IPTV provider of 2025](http://iptvgear.site)‚Äîand why you‚Äôll finally stop wasting money on subpar services.

# Why IPTVGEAR? (Because It Actually Works)

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîmost ""best IPTV"" lists are just regurgitated affiliate garbage. They recommend services they‚Äôve never even tested. Not me. I‚Äôve **personally** dealt with the frustration of pixelated streams, missing channels, and shady providers disappearing overnight. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so pumped about IPTVGEAR.

# 1. Zero Buffering Guarantee (Yes, Really)

You know that sinking feeling when your stream freezes right before the game-winning touchdown? Or when your show glitches during the climax? IPTVGEAR‚Äôs **anti-buffer tech** makes that a thing of the past.

I watched **UFC 300** on it live‚Äîno lag, no drops, just flawless HD. Their servers are optimized for peak traffic, so even when everyone‚Äôs online, your stream stays smooth.

# 2. 30,000+ Live Channels (No More Missing Out)

Most IPTV services brag about having ""tons of channels"" but conveniently leave out how many actually work. With IPTVGEAR, I‚Äôve yet to find a dead channel.

* **Sports:** NFL, NBA, Premier League, F1, UFC‚Äîall the major leagues, plus PPV events.
* **International:** Channels from over **100 countries** (perfect for expats or language learners).
* **Local & News:** Regional broadcasts, 24/7 news networks.
* **Entertainment:** HBO, Netflix-style VOD, kids‚Äô shows, documentaries.

# 3. Works Anywhere, Anytime

I travel a lot, and most IPTV services fail hard when you‚Äôre abroad. Either they block you or force you into VPN hell. IPTVGEAR? Works **without a VPN** in most countries (though they recommend one for extra privacy).

I streamed it in **Mexico, Canada, and the UK**‚Äîno issues. Plus, it works on:

* **Firestick** (4K+ models)
* **Android & iOS**
* **Smart TVs** (Samsung, LG, etc.)
* **PC & Mac**

Set-up takes **5 minutes**‚Äîway easier than dealing with cable installation.

# 4. Actual Human Customer Support (Shocking, Right?)

Ever tried getting help from an IPTV provider? Good luck. Most just take your money and vanish.

IPTVGEAR has **24/7 live support**‚Äîreal people who actually fix things. I had a login issue once, and they resolved it **in 10 minutes.** For IPTV, that‚Äôs basically a miracle.

# 5. No Sneaky Price Hikes

Some providers lure you in with cheap intro rates, then jack up the price. IPTVGEAR‚Äôs pricing is transparent:

* **$12/month** (Basic)
* **$25/3 months** (Best Deal)
* **$60/year** (Biggest Savings)

No hidden fees, no ""auto-renewal"" scams. Just simple, honest pricing.

# How IPTVGEAR Beats the Competition

# Flawless 4K Streaming (Even on Busy Nights)

I tested five other ""best IPTV service"" options during the Super Bowl last year. **Four of them crashed.** IPTVGEAR? Not a single hiccup. Their **anti-buffer tech** actually works‚Äîno more rage-quitting mid-game.

# No More Hunting for Content

Most IPTV services have gaps‚Äîmissing sports leagues, outdated VOD, or no international channels. IPTVGEAR covers **everything:**

* **Sports:** ESPN, NFL Network, Sky Sports, DAZN, etc.
* **Movies & Shows:** Latest releases, trending series, classics.
* **Kids & Family:** Cartoon Network, Disney, Nickelodeon.

It‚Äôs like having Netflix, Hulu, cable, and an international TV package in one.

# Easy to Use (Even for Non-Techies)

I‚Äôm not a tech wizard, and I hate complicated setups. IPTVGEAR works with **apps you already know**‚Äîlike TiviMate, IPTV Smarters, or their own custom app. Just download, enter your login, and boom‚Äîyou‚Äôre in.

# Reliable (Unlike Most IPTV Services)

Ever had a provider just **disappear** one day? Yeah, me too. IPTVGEAR has been around for years, with **98% uptime** and real customer reviews backing it up.

# Who‚Äôs IPTVGEAR Perfect For?

* **Cord-cutters:** Ditch cable but keep all the channels.
* **Sports fans:** Never miss a live game again.
* **Families:** Kid-friendly sections, movies for everyone.
* **Travelers:** Stream anywhere without restrictions.

# Final Verdict: Is IPTVGEAR the Best IPTV Provider for 2025?

After **six months** of daily use, here‚Äôs my take:

‚úÖ **Best for sports** (No freezing during big games)  
‚úÖ **Best for reliability** (No random shutdowns)  
‚úÖ **Best for content** (More channels than I‚Äôll ever need)  
‚úÖ **Best for support** (Actual humans answer questions)

If you‚Äôre tired of gambling with sketchy IPTV services, **IPTVGEAR is the answer.**

# Ready to Try It?

They offer a **24-hour free trial** (most don‚Äôt). Test it yourself at [iptvgear.site](http://iptvgear.site).

Still skeptical? Drop a question below‚ÄîI‚Äôll give you my honest take.

Happy streaming! üçøüé¨

# Conclusion

**A Final Word: Why IPTVGEAR Is the Best IPTV Provider for 2025 (And How It Changed My Streaming Game)**

Alright, let‚Äôs wrap this up‚Äîbecause if you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôre tired of wasting time on subpar streaming services that overpromise and underdeliver.

Remember that time I missed the final minutes of a Champions League match because my old IPTV service decided to buffer *right* as my team was about to score? Yeah, I nearly threw my remote through the TV. That‚Äôs when I finally gave IPTVGEAR a shot, and honestly? I wish I‚Äôd switched sooner.

Here‚Äôs the thing: finding the **best IPTV service** isn‚Äôt just about channel counts or flashy ads. It‚Äôs about reliability, support, and not pulling your hair out when you just want to unwind. After six months with IPTVGEAR, here‚Äôs what sticks with me:

* **No more ""waiting for the stream to catch up.""** Whether it‚Äôs the Oscars live or my daughter‚Äôs obsession with PBS Kids, it just *works*.
* **One subscription to rule them all.** I canceled two other services because IPTVGEAR had everything‚Äîsports, international channels, even those niche films my film-buff friend insists I watch.
* **Actual humans helping when you need it.** No bots, no copy-paste replies. Just real fixes in real time.

So, if you‚Äôre still on the fence, ask yourself: *How much is my time‚Äîand sanity‚Äîworth?* Why keep juggling apps, dealing with outages, or paying for channels you never watch?

**Here‚Äôs my no-BS advice:**

1. **Try the free trial.** Hit up [iptvgear.site](http://iptvgear.site) and test-drive it during peak hours (that‚Äôs when the losers fail).
2. **Pick the plan that fits.** At $12/month, it‚Äôs less than my coffee habit‚Äîand way more rewarding.
3. **Enjoy streaming like it‚Äôs 2025.** Because, well, it is.

At the end of the day, the **best IPTV provider** shouldn‚Äôt make you work for it. IPTVGEAR gets that. And hey, if you‚Äôre already using it, drop a comment‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear your take. If not? What‚Äôs holding you back? Life‚Äôs too short for buffering.

Cheers to smarter streaming,  
Jacob

**P.S.** Still scrolling? The trial‚Äôs 24 hours. You could be watching flawlessly by dinner. Just saying. üöÄ

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What makes IPTVGEAR the best IPTV service for 2025?**  
Great question! After testing over a dozen providers, IPTVGEAR stood out because it *actually delivers* where others fail. We‚Äôre talking zero buffering (even during peak hours like the Super Bowl), 30,000+ live channels, rock-solid reliability, and real human support that answers *fast*. Plus, it works seamlessly on Firestick, Android, Smart TVs‚Äîyou name it. No gimmicks, just great streaming.

**2. Is IPTVGEAR really buffer-free? My current service lags constantly.**  
I get the frustration‚Äînothing ruins a big game or movie night like endless loading circles. IPTVGEAR uses anti-buffer tech to keep streams smooth, even in 4K. I‚Äôve used it daily for six months, including during high-traffic events, and it‚Äôs been flawless. If your current service stutters, you‚Äôll notice the difference immediately.

**3. How does IPTVGEAR compare to cable or other streaming services?**  
Think of it as cable TV‚Äôs smarter, cheaper cousin. Instead of paying for bloated packages with channels you never watch, IPTVGEAR gives you *everything*‚Äîlive TV, sports, PPV, international channels‚Äîat a fraction of the cost. No contracts, no hidden fees, and no waiting for cable guys to show up. Just instant streaming, the way it should be.

**4. Will IPTVGEAR work on my device?**  
Chances are, yes! It‚Äôs compatible with Firestick, Android (phones/tablets), iOS (iPhone/iPad), Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, etc.), and even PCs. Setup takes about 5 minutes, and they‚Äôve got step-by-step guides if you need help. If you‚Äôre ever unsure, their support team can confirm compatibility before you sign up.

**5. What about customer service? My last IPTV provider ignored my emails.**  
Ugh, ghosting customers is a red flag. IPTVGEAR offers 24/7 *human* support‚Äîno chatbots or endless ticket queues. I‚Äôve reached out a few times (even at odd hours), and they‚Äôve always responded within minutes with real solutions. It‚Äôs one of the biggest reasons I recommend them.

**6. Are there hidden fees or price hikes?**  
Nope! One of my pet peeves is signing up for a ""budget"" service only to get hit with surprise charges later. IPTVGEAR‚Äôs pricing is transparent‚Äîyou‚Äôll see the exact cost upfront, and it stays the same for as long as you‚Äôre subscribed. They even offer discounts for longer plans (like annual subscriptions).

**7. How‚Äôs the channel selection? Do they have \[specific sport/network\]?**  
With 30,000+ live channels, they‚Äôve got *everything*‚Äîsports (NBA, NFL, Premier League, UFC PPV), news (CNN, Fox, BBC), international channels, and even niche stuff like local regional broadcasts. If there‚Äôs a specific channel you love, their support team can check availability before you commit.

**8. Is IPTVGEAR legal and safe to use?**  
This is super important. IPTVGEAR operates within legal guidelines, offering properly licensed content. Unlike sketchy free IPTV services (which often disappear or deliver malware), they‚Äôre a reputable provider with secure payment options and reliable service. Always prioritize safety over ""too-good-to-be-true"" deals!

**9. Can I try it before I buy?**  
Absolutely! They offer a trial (usually 24‚Äì48 hours) so you can test the streams, channel selection, and performance risk-free. It‚Äôs the best way to see if it fits your needs without committing upfront.

**10. What if I‚Äôm not tech-savvy? Is setup complicated?**  
Not at all! If you can download an app and enter login details, you‚Äôre golden. IPTVGEAR provides easy-to-follow setup guides (with screenshots/videos), and their support team will walk you through any hiccups. I‚Äôve helped friends in their 60s set it up‚Äîit‚Äôs that user-friendly.

Right now plan to run conduit (blue line) with fiber optic hdmi, cat6, and duplex fiber optic cable (future proofing) through wall and up to projector which will be ceiling mounted. Will also be running coax RCA cable for sub as well as speaker wire to rear speakers just in case ever want to add them (will be doing sub right away). Will also be running speaker wire (red line) for in-wall speakers along with extra for center channel speaker and ceiling speakers in case every want to center and ceiling. Room is 23x12 with 7 ft ceilings.

¬†So questions:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Anything wrong with this plan and layout? Reason putting receiver on that side is because will have turntable there and 2 other bookshelf speakers and also the niche in between in-wall speakers will be used as dry bar so would rather not have receiver there. Have kids and min space so would rather not have floorstanding speakers

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Re center speaker, not sure need one for room size and fact everyone will be seated fairly centrally, but if did want to add one, options are semi-limited as will have screen in front of optimal center speaker placement. So a) should I even bother with center speaker from get-go? B) if so, could I get away with having about 1 ft off floor (see elevation drawing). Could potentially put center up higher but that would mean would need acoustically transparent screen and don‚Äôt really want to lay out extra $$ for something may never need.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Re in-wall speakers, cavities will be rather deep and in case of left speaker, will have closet behind. Anything special need to do with left speaker? Will I need back-boxes for both as wall cavity behind is so different? And can anyone recommend good quality speakers for what will initially be 2.1 system? Trying to spend less than $600 per speaker. Heard a lot of good things re Kef, Sonance and Revel. Any particular ones recommended for this space? Use is 50/50 movies music

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Re sub, any recommendations for the space? Best Buy guy recommended sub with own amp. That needed? And where would I put the sub? Can I put it under coffee table? Or to left of couch?

1k3xo51,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k3xo51/could_a_keurig_kclassic_single_serve_brewer/,Could a Keurig K-Classic Single Serve Brewer Review Change Your Coffee Game Forever?,"Testing out the Keurig K-Classic Single Serve K-Cup Coffee Maker, model K-50, has been part of my morning routine for a while now, and it‚Äôs safe to say, I have thoughts. This classic coffee brewer delivers an impressive mix of convenience and simplicity, but it‚Äôs not without its quirks. Keurig has stuck to its strengths with this machine, offering a reliable and efficient way to embrace that much-needed caffeine fix.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is sleek and straightforward, fitting nicely in most kitchen setups. Its black plastic body doesn‚Äôt scream luxury, but it‚Äôs sturdy enough to withstand daily usage. The compact 9.8""D x 13.3""W x 13""H dimensions are surprisingly practical even for smaller countertop spaces. However, the plastic build can feel a little less premium compared to some pricier models. One feature I appreciated was the removable 48-ounce water reservoir‚Äîit made refilling and cleaning simple without a hassle.

**Ease of Operation**  
Operating this coffee maker doesn‚Äôt require an engineering degree. The button controls are basic, and selecting your desired cup size is a no-brainer. Brewing your coffee takes less than a minute, which is perfect for those rushed mornings. Even my younger siblings quickly mastered it when visiting for breakfast. The three k-cup pod brew sizes (6, 8, and 10 ounces) allow for a bit of flexibility in coffee strength, though honestly, I always go for the 6-ounce option‚Äîit yields the strongest brew.  

[Check Keurig K-50 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b018uq5ams/)  

**Functionality and Special Features**  
This coffee maker nails the essentials and even adds a few thoughtful features. The programmable auto-off function saves energy by shutting the machine down after two idle hours. The descaling option is a welcome addition, especially for those of us who forget to clean our coffee machines regularly. Over time, calcium deposits build up, and this feature keeps the machine running smoothly. While it lacks advanced programmable options or fancy touch displays, I found the basic functionality to be more than enough for my simple needs.

**Key Benefits**  
- Straightforward operation with simple button controls.  
- Compact design with a removable water tank for easy refills.  
- Energy-saving auto-off function.  
- Quick brewing in under a minute‚Äîperfect for busy mornings.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Simplicity can be a double-edged sword, especially here. There‚Äôs no indicator for how much coffee is brewing, and it‚Äôs impossible to adjust the temperature. These limitations might frustrate coffee aficionados. Additionally, the machine can get noisy‚Äîsomething I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about when trying to sneak in a cup early without waking the household.  
- The plastic body feels less premium.  
- Limited control over coffee temperature.  
- Noisier operation compared to some other models.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other single-serve brewers, like the Nespresso Vertuo, the K-Classic stands out for its affordability and compatibility with countless K-cup brands, offering a wider variety of flavors. The Vertuo, on the other hand, leans toward a more premium feel and provides a richer crema, but it limits you to Nespresso pods. The Hamilton Beach Scoop Coffee Maker is another noteworthy competitor, known for accommodating ground coffee without needing pods, although it sacrifices the auto-cleaning and compact design features in the Keurig. For me, the versatility inside Keurig's ecosystem keeps me from even considering switching.

**Affordable Quality**  
For the price, this coffee maker does offer excellent value. Sure, there are more feature-packed brewers out there, but they also come at a significantly higher price point.

I purchased my first machine in Dec 2024 and noticed about a month ago that my coffee was smelling and tasting like plastic. When I open the machine, there is a terrible chemical smell on the top half where the machine pierces the pods. After nespresso gave me the run around for an hour on a call (descaling and cleaning multiple times did not help) they sent me a replacement. I just made my first cup of espresso and the coffee tastes ok but the new machine has that same terrible chemical smell. 

At this point I‚Äôm starting to think all vertuo pop + machines must smell this way, unless I somehow got sent two bad machines. 

So, could someone else who owns this model open their machine and smell the upper half and tell me if it smells like chemicals?

One thing i had stumbled upon, was a science article stating that the reason you shouldn't microwave metal items is because the arcs tend to shoot off of pointes tips. So like forks, knives, spoons are a huge no go because they'll obviously catch fire, bit smooth and round objects are fine, because no pointy tip to shoot arcs. 

fast forward 5 years to a couple of months ago. I was drinking coffee in my half metal coffee mug and playing games. At some point coffee got cold, so my best bet was to microwave it. I had remembered reading the article in this moment, decided since nothing on this mug is pointy, I can microwave my cup. Threw the cup in the microwave for a couple of minutes and then decided to go to the bathroom while it was heating. 

Within seconds i hear popping and crackling. I quickly come out, see smoke and sparks coming out. I ran, unplugged tje microwave and in my genius state i pick up the damn thing run outside and throw it in the grass. By this point damage has been tho, with the smoke everywhere, my home alarm system had immediately notified the company and they call you within seconds. Because I didnhave my phone on me, next step is for them to call the fire department and the EMT. So while i was struggling to remember the PIN to my house system, Fire department and EMT were on their way. 

Once they showed up, I knew I was in trouble. They had asked me if i was okay, if i jad needed any help. I told them no I'm okay, my microwave just caught fire and while i was dealing with it and didn't hear the call. Fireman asked what happened, I kinda fumbled with words but ended up telling him that I tried to heat my metal mug. He looked at me like a complete idiot - rightfully so - and asked why. I told him about the article, and he basically said yeah you're an idiot man don't do it again. 

Once they left, I just went and took a shower and stayed in bed all day to try and calm down from anxiety and adrenaline running through me",2,1745185878.0,self,0,1.0,False

How likely is this a minor csf leak, and if so, do I have to see a doc about it (or will it heal on its own)? If you think I should go to the doc, how urgent would you say on a scale of 1 being call your primary tomorrow and try to get an appointment this week or next week to 9 go to urgent care today, to 10 go to the er immediately? FWIW, this does not feel urgent to me at all. 



Currently I‚Äôve had what I believe is a rough sinus infection with symptoms beginning 4/10. It has sucked bad and makes it very difficult to sleep. I do not suffer from seasonal allergies.  Today feels like an improvement at least as far as sinus infection goes. 

However, about 5 days ago or so, my nose has started dripping this yellow water out of the right nostril about 2/5 of the time when I bend over or lay down. It tastes a little salty, mostly bitter, and very slightly metallic. It‚Äôs very obviously not mucus. It‚Äôs very thin like water. I do have intermittent pressure headaches that include mainly my sinus area from my forehead, somehow stretching down to my upper teeth, and occasionally also the back of my head. The headaches are not really affected by my position: laying down relieves a tiny bit of the pain, but I still have a headache. 



Other history includes:
Mom of 4: 9f, 7m, 3f, 19mo male. Pre-eclampsia with severe features with my last. 

Type II diabetic, usually solely diet controlled but I‚Äôve been eating all the junk lately and my sugars are not good, but still under 200. 

Hypothyroidism (medicated), pcos. 

Medications/supplements:
-benzonatate 200 mg, taken at most twice a day from about 4/13-4/17, give or take a day. 
-Sudafed, once or twice a day from 4/13-4/17, give or take a day, until I realized it wasn‚Äôt helping. 

Daily:
-Liothyronine sodium aka cytomel (t3), 25mcg/day (prescribed)

Been dealing with a weird range of issues since January for which I would need to get your view/ advice.
So last January, I decided to give myself a massage using a massage gun which I had bought few weeks before and used it on my neck,shoulder and back (first time as I normally only use the gun for my legs and glutes).For context, I‚Äôm working out 3/4 times a week and always experienced stiffness/soreness in those areas of the upper body.

The morning after, whilst sat at my desk at work, I experienced an unsteady sensation with a loud single bang heart. This was followed by shoulder and arm discomfort  ( which I had for quite sometime before - just a bit more intense this time round ). I decided to self-present to my local hospital as I instantly thought of a stroke or an heart attack and linked this with the neck massage from the day before. There, all the investigations were normal (ECG, blood test, X ray), got discharged the same day and was advised to speak to my doctor which I did few days later.

During that period, I experienced multiple episodes characterised by transient unsteadiness and feeling as though blood/pressure was draining from my head along with stiffness ,numbness on the right side of my head/body and nausea/palpitations/shortness of breath 

I eventually got referred to a cardiologist and had another EGC, ultrasound,stress test and wore a patch monitor for 7 days which all came absolutely normal. In parallel, I also decided to see an ostheopath to potentially identify spine/cervical issues. I was referred for an MRI for the neck and lower back which did not find any major issues apart from a slightly bulged disk in the lower back which was fixed with couple of IDD therapy sessions and seemingly unrelated to the issues I initially consulted for. Neck seemed fine to the ostheopath and I just had few massage sessions which somehow provided some temporary relief. The therapist I have seen did not seem to know exactly what was going on and the only piece of advice given was to work on relaxation and breathing techniques ( did not really help).

The unsteadiness episodes from the first weeks slightly faded away ( even before starting the ostheo treatment course) but noticed some changes as I became very sensitive to coffee, weed ( occasional smoker here) would send my heartbeat over the roof and any stressful life event would re-trigger the episodes described above. I also feel some pressure in my mid- back where I can feel a pinch sensation( has been like this for years). One thing to notice is that being sat is when I am more likely to feel bad and standing up usually provides me with greater relief (lying down does not make a huge difference )

Looking back,I am just wondering if this could not be related to the vagus nerve that could be pinched somewhere or possibly ( temporarily) damaged by the gun massage? I‚Äôm a bit hopeless as I did hit the gym today for the first time in months where I only did some pulls ups and back extensions which provided great relief to my back&lower back but triggered most of the episodes which I described above. I was feeling completely dizzy and nauseous. Got so bad that it even made me seasick on the train getting me back home and could not eat anything as my stomach was really upset.

I‚Äôm now thinking of seeing a neurologist to get this further investigated but I‚Äôm feeling a bit down due to this as I don‚Äôt appear to find a way out of this‚Ä¶

1k3xap6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1k3xap6/sugar_ants_getting_out_of_control_heres_when_diy/,Sugar Ants Getting Out of Control? Here's When DIY Stops Working,"If you‚Äôve ever dealt with a trail of tiny black ants in your kitchen, bathroom, or workspace, you‚Äôve likely encountered what many people call *sugar ants*. These ants are small but stubborn, and while they're common in warmer seasons, their invasions can happen any time of year.

At first, you might reach for ant spray, vinegar, or some store-bought bait. And sometimes that works temporarily. But in other cases, the ants just keep coming. Here‚Äôs what to watch out for if you‚Äôre wondering whether it‚Äôs still a DIY job‚Ä¶ or something bigger.

**Why DIY Ant Control Doesn‚Äôt Always Solve the Problem**

Sprays and traps can kill the ants you see, but they rarely reach the main colony. Sugar ants are experts at hiding their nests inside walls, under floors, or deep in outdoor structures. Even if you wipe out one trail, they‚Äôll usually find another way in.

In some cases, especially in multi-room buildings, ants can split into multiple colonies. This is known as ‚Äúbudding,‚Äù and it often happens when a colony feels threatened like when it‚Äôs hit with heavy sprays or bait that doesn‚Äôt eliminate the queen.

**Signs That DIY Might Not Be Enough**

**1. They Keep Coming Back After Cleaning or Baiting** You've wiped everything down, used bait stations, maybe even tried natural repellents but the ants return, sometimes stronger. That usually means the source of the problem hasn't been touched.

**2. Ant Trails in More Than One Room** Ants popping up in separate parts of your space kitchen, bathroom, laundry room often means they‚Äôre nesting nearby or multiple colonies are forming.

**3. You Deal With Them Every Season** If you fight the same ant problem every spring or summer, it‚Äôs a sign they‚Äôve made themselves at home. At this point, surface-level solutions usually won‚Äôt hold.

**4. The Ants Are Showing Up in Sensitive Areas** This is especially frustrating if you‚Äôre dealing with food prep zones, kids‚Äô playrooms, or areas that need to stay especially clean. In places like that, ants aren‚Äôt just annoying, they're a contamination concern.

**Things You Can Still Try on Your Own**

If you're not ready to move beyond DIY, here are a few natural and store-bought approaches worth testing:

* **Vinegar + Water Spray:** Wipe down surfaces and ant trails to disrupt their scent trails.  
* **Peppermint or Tea Tree Oil:** Dab around entry points to discourage activity.  
* **Cinnamon or Coffee Grounds:** Sprinkle around known hotspots‚Äîsome folks say it helps.  
* **Diatomaceous Earth (food-grade):** Apply in thin lines near baseboards and entry points.  
* **Seal Entry Points:** Use caulk or weatherstripping to block tiny cracks and crevices.  

The trick is being consistent and combining multiple approaches. Sugar ants are small, smart, and very persistent.

Sugar ants might start as a tiny trail in your kitchen, but they can become a much larger issue especially if they spread or keep returning. It‚Äôs completely okay to start with DIY methods (that‚Äôs what this subreddit is about!), but it‚Äôs also smart to recognize when those methods have hit their limit.

While I was frustrated he didn't think to even offer to have a family member watch the baby while I was waiting in the ER with a neck brace on without being able to move. I kept looking around and it hit me I am literally the only person here without someone, my mom offered however she's 82 with health conditions so obviously I didn't want her there. But the fact my spouse didn't even think to figure out childcare I was upset, he just took out daughter along on his regular day, grabbed coffee looked at new car. Not work so much an errands. Whereas if it were him I would have dropped everything found a sitter and been there. That aside which I can chalk up to being a little clueless, since I didn't specifically say I wanted him there.

Friday I woke up obviously groggy and gross keep in mind our baby still gets up multiple times a night so I did that Thursday feeling awful since she's breastfeed and won't take a bottle. Friday I woke up and it was business as usual he left at 7:30 leaving me to clean up get the kids ready, make lunches, carry the baby etc. it didn't even occur to him to help me until we had a sitter come from 10-3 just to help. So I was frustrated, then he proceeded to let me handle dinner, clean up and bedtime x3 all alone he came in at 7 saying he has a long day and went to the gym.

Again frustrated I told him it would have been nice for him to skip the gym and come home maybe move some of his appointments since he is self employed to help me. He basically said it was not possible since it was short notice, annoying but ok I let it go since I did have help most of the day.

Now here comes the issue, SATURDAY he left the house at 8:00 am saying he has the gym class at 9:30 (which is an hour) I was assuming he would be home around 11:00. He showed up at 3:00 (he did call and say he had to finish some work things) his family all brought over dinners to help me for the next few days which was lovely. When we were sitting here was making such rude comments basically indicating that my injury isn't ""so bad"" I explained that they didn't give me an air cast because it was a hairline fracture and sprain and because I am young and not overweight putting some weight on it would help it help faster when inl said that he was laughing making an ""I'm not sure sure about that face "" basically slyly saying I am old and overweight ( 36 & 5'8 155 lbs) now the real kicker I warmed up dinner then he decided he was going to go to the coffee shop to work on emails

 1) he has an office at home 
2) he's been gone ALL day 

He said he'd be back at 7:00 conveniently missing our youngest bath and bed time then left me to clean up the kitchen and put the kids to bed. He came home at 8:30 PM just said he finished his work, I was already set up in the guest room saying I have a headache truth is yes I have a headache but I am hurt, I feel unsupported, neglected even.

DAE react in slowmotion to situations that aren't happy situations, like when the situation has already ended? I'm also venting so it's gonna be a long story.","Example.

My(31f) coworker (67m) always forced a hug and kiss on my cheeks as a greeting when we changed shifts.  Its made me really angry and sad because I always told him I didn't want to and took a step back, and he always responded with ""i do"" and then forced the hug and kiss.

Then around the holidays I met a little girl and I asked how old she was.  She was 6.  She was so small, so tiny. 
Here comes the TW, i was sa-ed by my older brother when I was 6 till my 13th(ish). 

Of course I already knew what happened to me. But seeing how tiny a 6 year old girl is just ruined me. I was so so so small when I was r*ped. 

After a lot of emotions i finally changed sadness into anger.  The anger motivated me for a bit to never let anyone touch me against my will again. 

I decided, the next time my coworker tries to force a hug and kiss again I will punch him (mind you ive never punched a living being in my life and probably never will).  
So here we go.  The time was there.
My coworker walked up to me and tried to hug and kiss me again, I took a step back and pushed him away.
I said ""NO i don't want to"".  

He grabbed my face and I couldn't pull away, only a little but he still managed to kiss my neck instead of my cheek.  He said: if only I was 30 years younger. 

I sort of laughed it off. And grabbed a coffee with him.

After the coffee he left.  And then i realized what just happened. 

I realized if I was ever going to punch someone that would've been the moment.  You know, in self defense. But i can't hurt people.

I cried all shift (we are completely alone during our shifts).  A lot of emotions. 

The next day he had the guts to complain to me (via text) that i didn't empty the barely filled thrash can.
I send him an angry response about which pretty much said his wife doesn't work here so he can clean his own mess up and to stop belittling me and to not force a hug and kiss because I said a million times I don't want to.

Do you know what he said? He said oh I didn't realize you didn't like it. 
Ex-ducking-cuse me?  A 67yo man doesn't know what NO means.

Dear lady from Virovitica, I am looking for you.

It is maybe half a year ago that we met at Kaufland in Virovitica on a Saturday afternoon. I was looking for chocolate and you approached me. ‚ÄúThis one is cheaper and equally good!‚Äù Well, actually, you spoke Croatian, but since I replied in English, you switched. Then you asked if I was on vacation, I told you, no, I live close by in Hungary. Do you live in Virovitica? Yes, you said. We exchanged a few more words, then we parted. You looked a few times at me after that. It was a very nice meeting, one that I won't forget. You looked at me, and the way you looked at me touched me. I felt an instant connection. I responded politely and open, but let you go. I thought, shall I follow you and ask you to share a coffee with me, or wait for you outside at the coffee bar? I didn't. I did not want to push myself onto you. It's not my way. I know that was a mistake. I know you would have welcomed getting acquainted. And, you could always have said: no, thank you, right?

Ever since, I have been visiting this shop on Saturday's, around 4 PM, hoping to see you. But, no.

If you happen to read this message, please let me know. I‚Äôd love to share that coffee with you.

I‚Äôve been using this sub to do some research on wedding planning as I‚Äôm planning mine for September 2026. I‚Äôve narrowed it down to 2 venues and would love any advice you all have based on the pros & cons below. Thank you so much for any insight you can share! 

Venue 1: Blockhouse. Portland, OR 
Pros: beautiful venue (my heart is set on it), minimal decorating needed. Generally speaking, it‚Äôs the vibe we want for our event - urban garden, lots of greenery and wood
Cons: no sleep accommodations on site, event can‚Äôt begin until 6pm (guest arrival, expected ceremony start between 6:30-7pm). It‚Äôs also right next to train tracks so there‚Äôs a possibility a freight train and/or Amtrak train will pass by during the event.

Venue 2: Jupiter Next. Portland, OR
Pros: open catering, sleep accommodations for couple + room block options for guests. Located in a central area with coffee shops, cafes, and restaurants/bars nearby. 
Cons: the rooms are slightly outdated, venue space is a blank slate so would require a lot of decoration.

On paper, Jupiter Next has more pros. However, my and my fiances hearts are set on Blockhouse. Jupiter feels like the more responsible choice based on the above - but Blockhouse is cheaper and has the same amount of great reviews. 

Based on the above, can you share any experience you‚Äôve had with similar pros/cons that you think are important to know or could sway us one way or another?

Even now‚Äîespecially now, as the world spins in unruly spirals and the skies feel heavy with unspoken grief‚ÄîI feel compelled to remind you:

Life is still beautiful.

Not in a perfect, polished way. Not always in laughter or sunrises unmarred. But in the way a cracked vase can still hold blooming flowers, and broken wings sometimes carry the farthest.

Beauty whispers to us in chaos like a candle in a storm. Consider this:

When thunder roars, a child still dances in puddles. Their boots splash muddy joy as if to defy the very storm that drenches them. That, to me, is proof‚Äîjoy survives.

Even in a war-torn village, a grandmother hums lullabies to a baby born beneath collapsing roofs. That child coos, not yet burdened by history. That lullaby still floats. Isn‚Äôt that beautiful?

A homeless man gives his last half sandwich to a hungry dog. A stranger leaves groceries on a neighbor‚Äôs doorstep without a name. Even when the world shatters, compassion finds cracks to pour through.

Think of your own breath‚Äîhow it rises even after weeping. The chest expands, contracts, steadies. That inhale is defiance. That exhale is release. Your lungs haven‚Äôt given up. They know something worth staying for exists.

Beauty exists in the mundane too. In chipped mugs filled with warm coffee. In handwritten notes left in lunchboxes. In the way a mother brushes her daughter‚Äôs hair, the same rhythm passed down like a gentle ritual of care.

It lives in resistance. In the voice that sings after silence. In bodies that move despite pain. In artists who paint joy over sorrow and lovers who reach for one another in the dark.

And even grief‚Äîthat ancient guest‚Äîis beautiful. Because it means we have loved deeply. It means we are still capable of holding meaning, even if it trembles in our hands.

Life is beautiful because we endure. Because we love. Because, despite everything, we try again.

Hold this letter close when the noise is too much. Read it in the stillness. Let it remind you: The world is wild, but it is still worthy. So are you.

With all the courage I can gather,
‚ÄîYours in wonder, always

Many people suggested using smoke bomb I know, maybe it was really hard to use it on this God forsaken bird/clock f*cking menace to society so I did it with the heart ring.

I am now a 23 y/o (female), this story happened when I was 16. I have shared this story with my friends but I still think that is story is so crazy that I need to get it out there. 

in high school I was awkward and honestly not a lot of people had showed interest in me. I say this to show that when I did get asked out for the first time I may have ignored some red flags because of the excitement and lack of experience I had. 

I met, let‚Äôs say Ryan (18), at a school event where all the members of the same club from different schools get together to play games at a park. 
It was a lot of fun I talked to a lot of people, but there was one person who was kind of on the outside of the crowd. I introduced myself and made small talk. The only thing I remember from this conversation is that when I asked what his favorite class was he said ‚Äúchemistry, because I like to blow stuff up‚Äù. I think I just thought this was a joke and laughed it off. By the end of the event I had gotten a few people‚Äôs snapchats including Ryan‚Äôs. That same night he texted me and asked me out to coffee. 

The next day I did my makeup all nice and wore my favorite outfit, I was just so excited that someone asked me out on my dream first date( a coffee date).
I get to the date and it was awkward at first. I was leading most of the conversation and he was pretty quiet. Eventually we both got more comfortable with the situation and were having a good time. I don‚Äôt remember how we got to this topic but, he mentioned the recent Florida shooting. 

We both agreed that it was tragic, but he said he ‚Äúunderstood where the shooter is coming from‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt understand why he is getting so much hate‚Äù.  

I responded ‚Äúhe is getting hate because he killed people‚Äù. 

At that point I was super creeped out and I made up a lie that I had to leave. 

After the date I told my friends about how much he freaked me out and that he gave me school shooter vibes. They had also been at the school event and knew who he was. We kind of laugh it off and everyone agreed that I dodged a bullet. 

It had been about a week since our date. He had snap chatted me a few times to see how I was doing and I kept my responses short but still polite. He eventually asked me out again for another coffee date. I declined the offer and made up some excuse that I was busy. Not even 10 minutes after I declined his offer I got a text from one of my friends with a screen shot of an article. It read: ‚ÄúStudent arrested for alleged bomb threats at ________ high school‚Äù and his mugshot. 

After reading the article I figured out he had been arrested 3 days earlier and was now released on bail. I was absolutely stunned I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Admittedly I made some poor jokes with my friends about how the date ‚Äúblew me away‚Äù and how ‚Äúour connection was explosive‚Äù‚Ä¶.humor was just how I coped with things in high school. But my biggest mistake was changing his contact information to the bomb emoji‚Ä¶. I know this was stupid. I had blocked him on Snapchat but I still had his phone number saved for some reason. We had never talked on text so I didn‚Äôt block his number. 
After I blocked him on snap chat I revived some texts: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. If you hear about me on news It just teaches stresses me out and I didn't mean it. I have lot of anxiety and depression rn I was gonna tell you that‚Äù 

At this point I was still taking this as a joke and not really getting how serious it all was. I thought as long as I didn‚Äôt respond every thing would be fine. 
Another few days go by and I thought that that was the end of this horrible date story. It was a school day and I was asleep, at about 6am I get woken up by my phone ringing. I was startled so I didn‚Äôt put on my glasses (I have horrible eyesight). I look down at my phone and I see a black dot instead of phone number. So I answer the phone and I say ‚Äúhello‚Äù. There is just silence on the other end. I look down again and realize that the black dot is actually a bomb emoji. I yell out ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù and I hang up the phone. Right after I hang up get another text: ‚Äú I want to jail last week‚Äù ‚ÄúLetting you know that I'm not bad person. I just have lot of issues with school, fake friends. I'm always in bottom of food chain because people make fun of me how I dressed and kind of rude thing. That what it led this rage on me and very stressed and I'm sorry‚Äù (this is his spelling and grammar) 

At this point it‚Äôs not funny anymore and I block his phone number. After all this I was very anxious and worried that our date was more meaningful to him than I thought and he was clearly not in jail anymore. I only told my friends and we made jokes but I was definitely freaked out after the phone call. 

I wish this was the end of this story but there is more that happened after I blocked him. Let me know if I should post a follow up to this story. Also if possible I can share the mug shot and texts from this situation. 

years after, I do not wish this person any harm and I truly wish him the best. I am sharing this because I do think in retrospect I was being a dumb ass and made some stupid decisions that made the situation worse but ultimately I was a dumb teenager in a crazy situation.

As well as instant, I usually have at least one cup of coffee a day made from ground beans, either from a cafetiere or an espresso machine. I always have milk - skimmed in the UK, half fat I think it's called in the USA.

Now to my question; I read a lot of American contemporary writing and I'm confused that the default seems to be that when a guest asks for coffee in your home is to offer 'creamer'. Is that right or is that just reflecting the genre of the writing? There is a product on sale here that might be similar; is it? This is the ingredients list;

Corn syrup solids 
Hydrogenated vegetable oil (coconut and/or palm kernel and/or soybean) 
Sodium caseinate (a milk derivative) 
Dipotassium phosphate 
Sodium aluminum silicate

The bar is covered in so much water and milk that the cups are sliding around on their own. It would be funny if you weren't so stressed. The store is packed, with every table occupied and at least five people all standing around the handoff counter. You're running in circles to sequence your drinks. Your coworker has been bumping into you repeatedly (but accidentally) every time you move to the handoff.

That was my situation when I handed a customer her drink. She handed it back, saying ""this is too much milk. I wanted light milk and extra ice."" My shift apologized for putting it into the register wrong, and I remade it. Filled the whole cup with ice and poured just a splash of milk on the top.

Now, I don't know if y'all know how ice in a cup works, but it makes the drink look a lot more full than it really is!! And this lady didn't know that for some reason!! üôÉ

I hand it back to her. She holds it at arm's length and just sneers at the cup for a minute. Then she turns to me and says ""can I just get my money back so I can go to a different Starbucks and get it made right?""

Internally I'm screaming because she just cost me precious time that I could've used to make my next 3 drinks. But out loud I say ""you can go down to the register for that."" She looks me up and down and walks over there.

My store's espresso machine is right next to the register. She is literally right next to me as she's getting her refund and I'm making more drinks, and she still has the audacity to say ""I've been to Starbucks all over the world and I have NEVER met a more rude barista!""

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA honestly my bad for tuning in to her conversation! My bad for even thinking about her anymore. Oopsies.

But BRO! I'm the most rude barista IN THE WORLD because you didn't learn volume displacement in fucking middle school?!!! Be serious. Please.

I tried to sarcastically say ""thanks!"" from behind the espresso machine but she couldn't hear me. She was still talking to my poor coworker about how terrible I am.

I had another woman upset with me today because I had to tell her we were out of lavender powder AND I couldn't accept her $50 bill. She said out loud, ""I'm getting denied a lot today."" My eyebrows FLEW up because, uh, I'm sorry?! I didn't know I was only allowed to say no to you one time! MY BAD

I still have an hour and a half before I can leave. If my SSV hadn't told me I was doing a good job today, I might have just threw my apron on the floor and walked out. Entitled, underappreciative, interrupting customers will be the death of me.

It's just coffee. I shouldn't be fuming hours later, feeling defensive over my moral character, because of coffee. Customers need to take several hundred chill pills.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and usability of whipped cream spray depend on several key features that impact the texture, taste, and dispensing efficiency. Understanding these features will assist in making an informed choice.

**Type of Cream:** The foundation of any whipped cream spray is the type of cream used. Options typically include dairy-based creams, non-dairy alternatives made from plant-based ingredients like coconut or soy, and blends that combine dairy with stabilizers. Dairy-based creams provide the classic, rich flavor and smooth texture, while non-dairy options cater to dietary restrictions and preferences, offering varying degrees of creaminess and taste profiles. Choosing the right type depends on personal taste and dietary needs.

**Propellant Gas:** The propellant used to expel the cream from the can significantly affects the product's texture and longevity. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most common propellant, known for creating a light and airy texture that dissipates relatively quickly. Other gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), can be used in some formulations, resulting in a slightly denser texture that may last longer. The propellant also influences the cream's flavor, with N2O generally considered to have a neutral impact, while CO2 can impart a slightly acidic taste.

**Sweetener Type and Level:** The sweetness of whipped cream spray is a critical factor, and manufacturers employ various sweeteners to achieve the desired taste. Common sweeteners include sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners like sucralose or aspartame. The type and amount of sweetener influence not only the taste but also the product's calorie content and suitability for different dietary requirements. Some brands offer unsweetened options, allowing users to customize the sweetness level.

**Stabilizers and Emulsifiers:** To maintain the whipped texture and prevent separation, whipped cream sprays contain stabilizers and emulsifiers. These additives, such as carrageenan, cellulose gum, and mono- and diglycerides, help to bind the ingredients together and prevent the cream from collapsing or becoming watery. The effectiveness of these stabilizers influences the product's shelf life and its ability to hold its shape after dispensing. Brands that prioritize natural stabilizers often appeal to consumers seeking cleaner ingredient lists.

**Nozzle Design:** The design of the nozzle plays a crucial role in the dispensing process and the resulting appearance of the whipped cream. Nozzles can vary in shape and size, affecting the pattern and volume of cream dispensed. Some nozzles are designed to create intricate swirls, while others provide a simple, uniform stream. The nozzle's functionality also includes features like drip prevention and ease of cleaning. A well-designed nozzle ensures a consistent and aesthetically pleasing application.

**Container Size and Material:** The size of the whipped cream spray can impacts its convenience and suitability for different usage scenarios. Smaller cans are ideal for occasional use, minimizing waste, while larger cans are more economical for frequent users. The container material, typically aluminum or steel, influences the product's shelf life and its ability to withstand pressure. Some brands offer recyclable containers, aligning with environmental considerations.

 ## Core Benefits

Whipped cream spray offers several practical benefits that make it a popular choice for both home cooks and professional chefs. Its convenience, versatility, and aesthetic appeal contribute to its widespread use.

**Instant Gratification:** The primary benefit of whipped cream spray is its immediate availability. Unlike traditional whipping methods that require time and effort, the spray can delivers a perfectly whipped topping in seconds. This is particularly advantageous when preparing desserts or beverages on the fly, saving time and eliminating the need for specialized equipment. The ease of use makes it accessible to users of all skill levels.

**Consistent Texture and Appearance:** Whipped cream spray provides a consistent texture and appearance that is difficult to achieve manually. The pressurized dispensing system ensures that the cream is evenly aerated, resulting in a smooth, uniform topping every time. This consistency is crucial for creating visually appealing desserts and beverages, adding a professional touch to homemade creations. The reliability of the product minimizes the risk of over-whipping or under-whipping, which can affect the final result.

**Versatility in Application:** The versatility of whipped cream spray extends beyond desserts. It can be used as a topping for hot beverages like coffee and hot chocolate, as a garnish for savory dishes like soups and salads, and as an ingredient in mousse and other creamy desserts. Its adaptability makes it a valuable tool in the kitchen, allowing for creative experimentation and quick enhancement of various dishes. The spray can also be used to fill pastries or create decorative accents on cakes and cupcakes.

**Portion Control and Reduced Waste:** Whipped cream spray allows for precise portion control, reducing waste compared to traditional methods. Users can dispense the exact amount of cream needed, minimizing leftovers that may spoil. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who only require small amounts of whipped cream at a time. The controlled dispensing also helps to maintain the product's freshness, as the can is sealed between uses, preventing contamination and preserving the flavor.

**Extended Shelf Life:** Compared to freshly whipped cream, whipped cream spray boasts a significantly longer shelf life. The pressurized can and stabilizers help to preserve the cream's texture and flavor for weeks or even months, provided it is stored properly. This extended shelf life makes it a convenient pantry staple, ready to be used whenever needed. The long shelf life also reduces the risk of spoilage, making it a cost-effective option for occasional users.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about the composition, usage, and storage of whipped cream spray. Addressing these common queries can help buyers make informed decisions.

**What are the main ingredients in whipped cream spray?**
The main ingredients typically include cream (dairy or non-dairy), sweetener (sugar or artificial sweeteners), propellant gas (nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide), and stabilizers (such as carrageenan or cellulose gum). The specific ingredients vary depending on the brand and formulation. Always check the product label for a complete list of ingredients and allergen information. Some brands also include flavorings, such as vanilla extract, to enhance the taste.

**How should whipped cream spray be stored to maintain its quality?**
Whipped cream spray should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat. While some brands recommend refrigeration after opening, others do not. Refer to the product label for specific storage instructions. Avoid storing the can in the freezer, as this can damage the propellant system and affect the cream's texture. Proper storage helps to maintain the cream's flavor and consistency.

**Is whipped cream spray suitable for individuals with dietary restrictions?**
The suitability of whipped cream spray for individuals with dietary restrictions depends on the specific product. Dairy-free options are available for those with lactose intolerance or dairy allergies. Sugar-free or low-sugar versions cater to individuals with diabetes or those seeking to reduce their sugar intake. Always check the product label for allergen information and nutritional details to ensure it meets your dietary needs.

**How long does whipped cream spray last after opening?**
The shelf life of whipped cream spray after opening varies depending on the brand and storage conditions. Generally, it can last for several days to a few weeks in the refrigerator. Look for changes in texture, odor, or color as indicators of spoilage. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label for optimal storage and usage guidelines. Discard the product if you notice any signs of deterioration.

1k3w9fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k3w9fy/does_blackdecker_12cup_coffee_maker_live_up_to/,Does BLACK+DECKER 12-Cup Coffee Maker Live Up to the Hype? Review,"Sometimes, you stumble upon a gadget promising to make your mornings easier, and for me, the BLACK+DECKER CM0915BKD 12-Cup Coffee Maker instantly caught my attention. Mornings at my house are a scramble‚Äîkids running around, breakfast in the works, and me desperately clutching the hope that I‚Äôll get coffee in my system before noon. This coffee maker, with its 12-cup capacity and efficient Vortex Technology, seemed like it was built just for chaotic days like mine. For a week straight, I put it through its paces, brewing pots of coffee for myself, the occasional neighbors who dropped in, and a few friends who wanted to test it out too.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed as I unboxed it was how compact yet robust this coffee maker appeared. Its metallic black finish made it look right at home on my semi-modern kitchen counter, without taking up too much space. Standing at 12.2 inches tall and just over 8 inches wide, it‚Äôs neat and streamlined, perfect for tight spaces. The buttons are minimalistic and clearly labeled, which I appreciated because I hate fumbling with overly complicated appliances before I‚Äôm caffeinated. It also has a removable filter basket, which turns out to be dishwasher-safe (thank goodness). Cleaning appliances isn‚Äôt high on my list of fun activities, so this was definitely a win.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Let‚Äôs talk about the coffee. Using the Vortex Technology, which evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds, this machine boasts maximum flavor extraction. Did it live up to the promise? Honestly, yes. I could taste the evenness in the brew, which came out rich and not at all weak, even when I tried using grounds of varying freshness. One of my coffee-loving coworkers dropped by for a test run, and she immediately commented on the full-bodied flavor. Honestly, I found myself brewing a whole pot even if I only wanted a cup because the coffee didn‚Äôt feel diluted or ‚Äòrushed,‚Äô like some budget machines tend to produce.

[Check BLACK+DECKER CM0915BKD price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c8b9v7hr/)

**Convenience and Features**  
This unit is chock-full of features designed to make your experience easier. My favorite? The Sneak-A-Cup feature. You can pour a single cup while the brewing cycle is still ongoing, and it magically doesn‚Äôt spill all over the counter (unlike my last coffee maker). As a father trying to keep up with the morning hustle, being able to grab that first steaming mug without waiting for the pot to fill was life-changing... Ok, maybe that‚Äôs dramatic, but you get my point. The unit also has a ""Keep Hot"" carafe plate that managed to keep coffee warm for hours, perfect for my wife, who likes her coffee in sips over time. Just remember to place the carafe back in under 30 seconds after using Sneak-A-Cup; otherwise, it overflows. Learned that the hard way on Day 2.

**Strengths**  
Some ‚Äústand-out strengths‚Äù genuinely reinforce why this model is such a hit for daily usage:  
- Compact design makes it ideal for small kitchens or crowded counters.  
- Vortex Technology provides rich, even extraction, ensuring flavorful coffee every time.  
- Sneak-A-Cup feature is an absolute lifesaver for busy mornings.  
- The removable filter basket drastically simplifies cleanup and maintenance.  

**Critiques**  
Of course, there were a few quirks and limitations:  
- The timer is notably absent and could put off someone keen on programmable brews.  
- Its plastic components don‚Äôt feel as durable as the rest of the machine.  
- Small spills occur if the carafe isn‚Äôt positioned perfectly under the drip spout.  
- The brewing process isn‚Äôt the quietest‚Äîsomething to think about if early silence matters to you.

**Product Competitors**  
When you delve into the world of coffee makers, the competition is fierce. Two similar competitors immediately come to mind: the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and Mr. Coffee 12-Cup. While the BLACK+DECKER offers better flavor consistency thanks to the Vortex Technology, the FlexBrew provides versatility in making a single cup or a full carafe‚Äîideal for smaller households. Alternatively, Mr. Coffee‚Äôs insulated carafe is quieter and maintains heat slightly better than the BLACK+DECKER‚Äôs heated base, though it lacks the same depth of flavor extraction. If you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes simplicity with great-tasting coffee, this model excels spectacularly over its counterparts, though it may lack some premium functionalities.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Price plays a big role in deciding if a gadget like this deserves your counter space. Considering the semi-premium features like Sneak-A-Cup, Keep Hot functionality, and Vortex infusion, this coffee machine delivers admirable cost-effectiveness for a mid-range drip coffee maker. While there are other viable candidates, it‚Äôs hard to beat the balance this strikes between quality and affordability. For committed coffee drinkers who aren‚Äôt keen on splurging unnecessarily, I‚Äôd say this machine justifies its price tag.

I bought this at the recommendation of a friend and it's truly one of the most beautiful pinks I've ever worn. I don't even know how to describe how beautiful the finish of this polish is. However, I can say that it is glowy, delicious, and looks RICH. When I look it, it's an instant dopamine hit. 

I beg you...whatever magic you made with Petals.... make more of it. I know we're waiting on a summer collection, but maybe your next collection can be petals-formula neutrals? I can already imagine a coffee color in that formula and it looks divine. To be honest though, I'll take whatever I can get. 

So, please dear god, allow me to justify giving you my life savings and making more of Petals (in other colors.)

That is my rant/request. THANKS, QUEEN!

1k3w8jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k3w8jo/find_out_if_the_keurig_kduo_gen_2_coffee_maker/,Find Out if the Keurig K-Duo Gen 2 Coffee Maker Fits Your Needs,"Using the Keurig 5000378536, officially known as the Keurig K-Duo Gen 2 Single Serve & Carafe Coffee Maker, has been a unique and rewarding experience over the past few weeks. Balancing convenience and versatility, this coffee maker caters to those who want to serve a single cup or a full carafe of coffee. It‚Äôs truly designed for every coffee-drinking moment, but there are a few nuances worth diving into. 

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

At first glance, the sleek black exterior and compact design stood out immediately. Its dimensions, 12.9"" x 11.1"" x 12.7"", make it easy to fit onto my crowded kitchen countertop without overwhelming the space. The dual brewing function‚Äîsingle cup and carafe‚Äîis seamlessly incorporated into the structure, leaving no confusion about its usage. The digital control panel on the front is straightforward to use, even first thing in the morning when I‚Äôm not functioning at 100%. However, the materials feel a little less durable than I‚Äôd hoped; the plastic components might not age well if you‚Äôre rough with your appliances like I am.

**Brewing Features in Focus**

Having the flexibility to brew with both K-Cup pods and coffee grounds is a game-changer. I‚Äôm someone who loves a quick K-Cup brew during a busy week but prefers the richness of fresh coffee grounds for slow weekend mornings. The inclusion of Multistream Technology enhances the flavor experience by saturating the coffee grounds evenly. There‚Äôs noticeable depth and aroma in every cup, whether you want it hot or iced. 

Speaking of iced coffee, the Brew Over Ice option is excellent. It adjusts the brewing temperature for a stronger concentration and less ice melt. I experimented during a heatwave, and it delivered perfectly chilled, flavorful coffee every time. However, the Strong Brew function deserves a special mention; it truly makes a bold and robust cup, though the flavor could be more refined.

**Advantages**

The Keurig K-Duo doesn‚Äôt just stop at brewing basics. It‚Äôs loaded with features that stand out:  

- The 72oz removable water reservoir minimizes refills, especially during busy mornings with multiple coffee drinkers.  
- The programmable carafe functionality allowed me to set up coffee the night before, so waking up to a 12-cup carafe of freshly brewed coffee felt luxurious.  
- The Pause & Pour option is a surprising yet handy feature. It pauses brewing for around 20 seconds, enabling you to pour a cup mid-brew. No more awkward waiting time!

**Less Favorable Aspects**

While I genuinely enjoy using this coffee maker, it‚Äôs not without its flaws:  

- The carafe drips a bit when pouring, which can be frustrating, especially if you‚Äôre serving guests.  
- The machine is slightly louder than expected during brewing, which isn‚Äôt great when you‚Äôre making coffee before everyone‚Äôs awake.  
- Adjusting to the extra hot feature for single cups felt finicky; I accidentally scorched my tongue the first time I tried it.  

**Ease of Use and Daily Convenience**

Day-to-day use of this coffee maker has been straightforward. The button interface feels intuitive, and I appreciate the clearly marked brew sizes for both the carafe and the single-serve options. It brews everything from 6oz single servings to 12-cup carafes, offering flexibility for any occasion. Cleaning, while generally hassle-free due to the removable water tank and reusable filter, requires a bit more effort when calcium builds up due to hard water.

**Competitive Options**

When comparing this product to brands like Ninja‚Äôs DualBrew Pro or Breville‚Äôs Precision Brewer, the Keurig K-Duo excels in its simplicity and affordability. The DualBrew Pro offers a slightly better quality of coffee flavor and build material, but it lacks the straightforward usability of the K-Duo. On the other hand, Breville brings high-end features like advanced temperature control, but it‚Äôs more expensive and less intuitive for novice users.

In comparison, this machine hits the middle ground perfectly for everyday, non-specialty use. It may not have the premium features of the Breville or the sleek build of Ninja machines, but it shines in delivering a hassle-free, versatile brewing experience.

**Price Performance**

Given its combination of single-serve brewing, carafe functionality, and specialty options like Brew Over Ice, the value offered by this coffee maker is undeniable. Similar products in its category often offer just one brewing method or come with fewer features for a similar price. This balance of versatility and ease makes it a worthy investment, even if you‚Äôre just an occasional coffee drinker.

An In-Depth Review,"Testing out the Keurig 5000378536 K-Duo Hot & Iced Single Serve & Carafe Coffee Maker, I couldn‚Äôt help but appreciate the clever design and versatility of this genial product. It offers a unique dual functionality‚Äîbrew a quick single cup with K-Cup pods or make a full carafe using coffee grounds. As someone who switches between solo coffee-drinking mornings and hosting coffee-loving guests, this brewer felt like a perfect fit for my lifestyle.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker immediately grabs attention with its sleek black design and compact footprint. Measuring 12.9""D x 11.1""W x 12.7""H, it slots effortlessly onto my crowded countertop without dominating the space. The removable 72oz water reservoir is a godsend, sparing me constant refills during my coffee binges. Its intuitive front-facing control panel feels easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the buttons are satisfyingly clicky. 

[Check Keurig 5000378536 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d8lxrhq8/)

**Performance and MultiStream Technology**  
This machine delivers impressively in the flavor department, thanks to the MultiStream Technology. It ensures even saturation of the coffee grounds, leading to a deeper, richer flavor profile whether I'm brewing hot or iced coffee. I‚Äôve experimented with both modes, and the Brew Over Ice feature is particularly handy for hot summer mornings. Even with the added ice, the taste remains bold and flavor-packed.

**Key Benefits**  
- Offers dual brewing functionality (single-serve or carafe).  
- MultiStream Technology extracts rich flavor consistently.  
- The 72oz reservoir reduces refill disruptions.  
- Brew Over Ice mode is fantastic for iced coffee enthusiasts.  

**Auto Brew and Programmable Features**  
One of my favorite aspects of this coffee maker would have to be the programmable Auto Brew for the carafe. Setting it the night before felt like a small act of self-care‚ÄîI woke up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the house. The pause and pour feature is quite thoughtful too, letting me sneak a quick cup mid-brew. The heating plate kept my carafe hot and drinkable well into late breakfasts, which I greatly appreciated.

**Limitations**  
- The machine isn't the quietest‚Äîespecially early in the morning when silence can feel sacred.  
- A bit of a cleaning hassle when switching from K-Cups to coffee grounds.  
- I noticed the carafe isn‚Äôt completely drip-free if you pour too quickly.  

**Competitors on the Market**  
Stacking it against other coffee makers like the Ninja DualBrew Pro and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 2-Way Brewer was interesting. The Ninja excels in blending hot and cold coffee, but I found its footprint much larger. The FlexBrew matches in versatility but lacks the sleek design and features like MultiStream Technology that the Keurig offers. This brewer feels like it edges ahead in terms of consistency for iced coffee and overall convenience.  

**True Value**  
This Keurig unit sits comfortably in the realm of cost-effectiveness. While some might feel it leans towards the higher price bracket, the convenience of versatile brewing options combined with quality brewing methods justifies the spend. If you, like me, juggle coffee preferences daily, it becomes a value-packed purchase.

I‚Äôve been using this 64 oz mason jar pitcher for preparing my daily iced coffee and even experimenting with sun tea, and I have some experiences, both great and not-so-great, to share.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the design of this cold brew pitcher feels well-thought-out. The glass jar is made from heavy-duty, soda lime glass that feels sturdy and durable. The plastic lid, while lightweight, comes with a silicone ring for an airtight seal. One thing I appreciated about the design was the ergonomically thickened handle‚Äîno wrist strain even when it‚Äôs filled to the brim. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the pitcher isn‚Äôt suitable for extreme temperature swings. I learned the hard way when I tried pouring hot water in just after it had been chilled in the fridge. Not a good idea.

**Ease of Use**  
Its operation mode is manual, so there‚Äôs no plugging in or buttons to press‚Äîjust good old hands-on brewing. The wide mouth makes it easy to fill with coarsely ground coffee or tea leaves, and the 160-micron stainless steel mesh filter is a game-changer. Honestly, that filter prevents even the sneakiest coffee grounds from ruining my brew. Plus, cleanup is a breeze. A quick rinse or toss in the dishwasher, and it‚Äôs ready to go again.

****

**Performance and Versatility**  
The coffee it brews is smooth and flavorful, thanks to that ultra-dense filter. I‚Äôve tried making tea and even lemonade in it, and the results have been equally satisfying. The flip-cap design on the pour spout deserves special mention. It‚Äôs practically drip-free, which is a lifesaver when I‚Äôm half-awake and need my coffee without cleaning up spills. However, because the spout is plastic, I noticed some staining after a while, especially from heavily brewed teas. It doesn‚Äôt affect the taste, but it‚Äôs a cosmetic issue.

**Merits**  
- Airtight silicone-sealed lid preserves beverage freshness.  
- Durable soda lime glass construction handles everyday knocks gracefully.  
- Ultra-fine stainless steel filter efficiently strains coffee, tea, or even fruit-infused drinks.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts simplify cleaning‚Äîideal for the busy morning rush.

**Critiques**  
- Incompatible with drastic temperature changes, a limitation for versatile usage.  
- Plastic components, particularly the spout, can stain over time.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
The market is loaded with cold brew pitchers, and this product faces stiff competition. Comparing it to something like the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker, the QHH pitcher stands out because of its larger capacity (64 oz versus Takeya‚Äôs 32 or 64 oz options) and heavier build quality. Takeya does offer a fully BPA-free plastic build which eliminates concerns about glass fragility, though it lacks the premium aesthetic of soda lime glass. On the flip side, competing brands like County Line Kitchen feature rustic mason jars with metal lid designs, potentially appealing to those who lean towards vintage aesthetics. What sets this pitcher apart is its finer mesh filter, which outperforms many competitors in preventing grounds from slipping through.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering the build quality, ease of daily use, and versatility for brewing coffee, tea, and other drinks, this cold brew maker offers excellent **money's worth**. Many competitors with similar features land in higher price ranges, making this item a smart pick for anyone needing a reliable and stylish pitcher. Of course, prices fluctuate, so grabbing it during a sale is even sweeter.

The machines hooked up to eight-year-old Eli beeped with rhythmic indifference, counting down what the doctors had grimly informed him were Eli's final days.

Acute leukemia. Aggressive. Unresponsive to treatment.

The words echoed in Jack's head like a death knell. Three months of hospitals, specialists, experimental treatments, and second opinions had led to the same devastating conclusion: there was nothing more medical science could do.

""Dad?"" Eli's voice, once bright and mischievous, now barely a whisper.

Jack turned from the window, forcing a smile. ""Hey, buddy. How're you feeling?""

He stumbled to the bathroom, splashing cold water on his face. His reflection shocked him‚Äîunshaven, hollow-eyed, a man aged a decade in three months. He braced himself against the sink, fighting back tears.

""I'd do anything,"" he whispered to his reflection. ""Fucking anything.""

""Morgan? Jack Morgan?""

Jack glanced up from his coffee in the hospital cafeteria. The man standing before him was vaguely familiar‚Äîtall, with salt-and-pepper hair and dark-rimmed glasses.

""Sorry to interrupt. I'm Robert Keller. My son was in Eli's class last year."" The man shifted uncomfortably. ""I heard about what's happening. I'm sorry.""

Jack nodded, too exhausted for pleasantries. ""Thanks.""

Instead of leaving, Keller sat down across from him, leaning forward. ""Listen, this might sound strange, but... have you heard of Albion Thorne?""

""No. Should I have?""

Keller glanced around, then lowered his voice. ""He's... not a conventional doctor. More of a healer. My nephew had stage four pancreatic cancer. Terminal. Three months to live, at best.""

Jack's attention sharpened.

""Thorne helped him. He's been in remission for two years now. Doctors can't explain it.""

""Some kind of alternative medicine guy?"" Jack asked, skepticism bleeding through his exhaustion.

""Not exactly."" Keller pulled out a business card and slid it across the table. ""He doesn't advertise. Only works by referral. I had to beg my sister for his contact information.""

The card was simple: cream-colored with a single phone number embossed in black.

""Why are you telling me this?"" Jack asked.

""Because I've seen your son running around the playground with mine. Because no kid deserves what Eli's going through."" Keller stood. ""And because sometimes, when medicine fails us, we need something else.""

After Keller left, Jack stared at the card, turning it over in his fingers. Despite his skepticism, he slipped it into his wallet.

That night, as he watched Eli sleep, the machines continuing their ominous countdown, he pulled out the card again.

*What the hell do I have to lose?*

---

The address led Jack to a neighborhood he'd never visited before‚Äîold Victorian houses lining quiet streets on the outskirts of town. Number 1308 was set back from the road, partially obscured by overgrown oak trees. The house itself was immaculately maintained, painted a deep blue with white trim, a stark contrast to the wildness of its garden.

Jack hesitated at the gate, doubt creeping in. This was madness, pursuing some miracle worker on the advice of a man he barely knew. But the image of Eli, frail and fading in his hospital bed, propelled him forward.

The door opened before he could knock. A woman in her fifties with silver-streaked black hair and sharp blue eyes regarded him with quiet appraisal.

""Mr. Morgan. Right on time.""

Jack frowned. ""How did you‚Äî""

""Mr. Thorne is expecting you. Please, follow me.""

The interior was unexpectedly modern, all clean lines and minimalist furniture. The woman led him through a series of rooms to a sunlit office at the back of the house. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked a lush garden.

""Mr. Morgan has arrived,"" she announced, then disappeared, closing the door behind her.

The man rising from behind the desk wasn't what Jack had expected. No crystal pendants or New Age trappings. Albion Thorne was in his sixties, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit. His face was lined with age, but his eyes were startlingly alert‚Äîso dark they appeared almost black.

""Mr. Morgan."" His voice was deep, cultured. ""Please, sit.""

Jack remained standing. ""How did you know I was coming? I didn't call ahead.""

Thorne smiled, gesturing again to the chair. ""Word travels quickly in certain circles. Robert Keller mentioned you might seek my assistance.""

Reluctantly, Jack sat. ""Keller said you helped his nephew. Cured his cancer.""

""I provide services that conventional medicine cannot."" Thorne settled back into his chair. ""Tell me about your son.""

For the next twenty minutes, Jack recounted Eli's diagnosis and decline, surprised by his own forthrightness with this stranger. Thorne listened without interruption, his dark eyes never leaving Jack's face.

""The prognosis is clear,"" Jack finished. ""They've given him days, maybe a week.""

Thorne was silent for a long moment. ""And you've come to me hoping for a miracle.""

""I've come because I'm desperate,"" Jack admitted. ""Because I'll try anything.""

""Anything?"" Thorne's voice remained neutral, but something in his eyes sharpened. ""Be careful with such declarations, Mr. Morgan. They can bind you in ways you don't anticipate.""

Jack leaned forward. ""Can you help my son or not?""

""I can. But my services come with conditions.""

""Money isn't an issue. I'll pay whatever‚Äî""

Thorne waved a dismissive hand. ""I don't want your money, Mr. Morgan.""

""Then what?""

""A favor."" Thorne's lips curved in a thin smile. ""To be determined and called upon at my discretion.""

Jack frowned. ""What kind of favor?""

""That remains to be seen. But you'll know when the time comes.""

""That's it? Just a favor?""

""Nothing is ever 'just' anything, Mr. Morgan."" Thorne leaned back, studying him. ""Do you accept these terms?""

Warning bells rang in Jack's mind. This was bizarre, potentially dangerous. Yet what choice did he have? Eli was dying.

""Yes,"" Jack said. ""I accept.""

""Good."" Thorne opened a drawer and removed a small wooden box. ""Tonight, after your son is asleep, place this beneath his bed. Do not open it. Do not move it until I contact you.""

Jack took the box. It was heavier than it looked, about the size of a paperback book, carved with intricate symbols he didn't recognize.

""That's it?"" Jack asked incredulously.

""That's it."" Thorne rose, extending his hand. ""We have an agreement, Mr. Morgan. A life for a favor.""

As they shook hands, Jack felt a strange sensation‚Äîlike static electricity but colder, seeping beneath his skin. Thorne's dark eyes bore into his, and for a heartbeat, Jack was certain they changed‚Äîpupils expanding until no white remained.

Then it was gone, and Thorne was showing him to the door.

""Remember our terms,"" were Thorne's parting words.

---

Jack smuggled the box into the hospital that evening, feeling ridiculous. What was he doing, placing his hopes in some cryptic stranger with his mysterious box? Yet desperation trumped reason.

He waited until both Eli and Karen were asleep, Karen slumped uncomfortably in the visitor's chair. Then he crouched, sliding the box beneath the hospital bed, feeling foolish and desperate in equal measure.

Nothing happened. No miraculous transformation, no sudden improvement. Eli slept on, his breathing still labored, his skin still ashen.

Jack returned to his chair by the window, watching the city lights blur through his tears.

*What the fuck did I expect?*

He must have dozed off because he woke to sunlight streaming through the window and a nurse checking Eli's vitals.

""Good morning, Mr. Morgan,"" she said brightly. ""Doctor Reynolds wants to speak with you.""

Jack's heart seized. Was this it? Had Eli declined further overnight?

But the doctor's face told a different story. ""I can't explain it,"" Reynolds said, flipping through Eli's chart with a furrowed brow. ""His blood work shows a significant reduction in blast cells. It's as if the leukemia is... retreating.""

""What does that mean?"" Karen asked, clutching Jack's arm.

""It means we're seeing improvement where, frankly, none was expected."" The doctor looked perplexed. ""We'll need to run more tests, but...""

""But he's getting better?"" Jack pressed.

""Cautiously, yes, I'd say he is."" Reynolds shook his head. ""I've never seen anything like this.""

Over the next three days, Eli's recovery accelerated beyond any medical explanation. His blood counts normalized, his color returned, and his energy rebounded. The doctors used words like ""unprecedented"" and ""spontaneous remission,"" but their bafflement was clear.

On the fourth day, Eli sat up in bed, asking for real food and his Nintendo Switch. By the end of the week, discussions turned to discharge plans.

""It's a miracle,"" Karen kept saying, tears of joy replacing those of grief.

Jack said nothing, his relief mingled with unease. He checked beneath the bed daily, but the box remained where he'd placed it, untouched.

Until the morning it wasn't.

He reached under the bed, finding only dust. Panicked, he searched the room, thinking perhaps a custodian had moved it during cleaning.

Nothing.

That night, as he drove home to shower and change clothes‚Äîa luxury he hadn't afforded himself in days‚Äîhis phone chimed with a text from an unknown number:

*The box has served its purpose. Remember our agreement.*

---

Two weeks later, Eli came home. The doctors continued to monitor him closely, but all signs pointed to complete remission. ""A medical anomaly,"" they called it. Karen had moved back in ""temporarily,"" to help with Eli's recovery, she said, but Jack sensed her renewed presence might become permanent.

He should have been elated. His son was alive, his family potentially reuniting. Yet Jack couldn't shake a creeping dread. The box, Thorne, the favor‚Äîit haunted him.

He tried calling the number from which the text had come. Disconnected. He drove to Thorne's house, only to find a different family living there, confused by his questions. ""We've owned this house for ten years,"" the woman insisted. There was no record of an Albion Thorne in any directory Jack searched.

Had he imagined it all? A stress-induced fantasy coinciding with Eli's inexplicable recovery?

But then the dreams began.

He was standing in a room he didn't recognize, dark except for a single light illuminating a man bound to a chair, his face covered by a burlap sack. Blood pooled beneath the chair.

*Cut*, a voice whispered, seeming to come from both everywhere and nowhere. *Cut away his sins.*

In the dream, Jack found a knife in his hand, its blade gleaming impossibly bright in the dim room.

*He has taken what wasn't his. Now you must take from him.*

He woke gasping, sweat-soaked and trembling.

The same dream came the next night, and the next, growing more vivid each time. The bound man struggling against his restraints. The knife growing heavier in Jack's hand. The voice more insistent.

On the fourth night, the dream changed. The bound man's face was revealed‚Äîa middle-aged stranger with terrified eyes and a gagged mouth. On his forehead, a symbol was drawn in what looked like blood‚Äîthe same symbol Jack had seen carved into Thorne's box.

*Douglas Mercer, 1487 Oakwood Drive*, the voice whispered. *He owes a debt. Collect it for me.*

Jack woke with those details burned into his memory. He tried to dismiss it‚Äîjust a nightmare‚Äîbut the name and address repeated in his mind all day like a mantra.

That evening, against all better judgment, he found himself driving to Oakwood Drive. *Just to prove to myself it's not real*, he told himself. *Just to end this.*

1487 Oakwood Drive existed. It was a modest ranch-style house with a well-kept lawn. A mailbox confirmed the resident: D. Mercer.

Jack sat in his car, staring at the house, horror and disbelief warring within him. He was about to drive away when his phone chimed.

*The first payment is due. Fail, and our agreement is void.*

The implication was clear.

*No*, Jack typed back furiously. *I never agreed to hurt anyone.*

*A favor, Mr. Morgan. Those were the terms. Your son lives because Douglas Mercer will not.*

Jack threw the phone onto the passenger seat, gripping the steering wheel until his knuckles whitened. This couldn't be happening. He wouldn't‚Äîcouldn't‚Äîkill a stranger.

But Eli's face swam before him‚ÄîEli, who just that morning had been racing around the backyard, his laughter a sound Jack had thought he'd never hear again.

*I'll go to the police*, he thought desperately. But what would he say? That a man who couldn't be found had cured his son's terminal cancer in exchange for murder? That he was receiving threatening texts and vivid dreams? They'd think he was insane.

He drove home in a daze, hoping to find the texts gone, proof it had all been some bizarre hallucination. Instead, he had three new messages.

*He is alone tonight.*
*The tools you need are in your trunk.*
*Midnight, Mr. Morgan. Not a minute later.*

With shaking hands, he popped his trunk. A black duffel bag sat there‚Äîa bag he'd never seen before. Inside: zip ties, a knife, gloves, and a burlap sack.

Jack slammed the trunk shut, retching onto his driveway.

""Jack?"" Karen called from the front door. ""Everything okay?""

""Fine,"" he managed, wiping his mouth. ""Something I ate.""

That night, he lay awake beside Karen, watching the clock tick toward midnight. He wouldn't go. He couldn't. He'd find another way to protect Eli.

At 11:45, his phone lit up with a final message:

*Your son's life or his. Choose.*

Attached was a photo of Eli sleeping peacefully in his room‚Äîa photo taken seconds ago, from inside their house.

---

The clock struck 1 AM when Jack pulled back into his own driveway. He sat in the dark car, staring at his bloodied hands gripping the steering wheel.

*What have I done?*

The night replayed in fragmented flashes: Breaking into Mercer's house. The man's confusion turning to terror. The struggle that ended with Mercer bound to a kitchen chair, just like in the dreams. The knife in Jack's shaking hand.

""Please,"" Mercer had begged. ""I have money. Whatever you want.""

""What did you do?"" Jack had asked, desperate to find some justification, some reason this man deserved his fate. ""Thorne says you owe a debt.""

Mercer's eyes had widened at the name. ""Thorne? Oh God, no. Please, you don't understand what he is‚Äî""

The rest was a blur of blood and screams that Jack couldn't bear to recall. He'd followed the instructions that appeared in his mind like they were being etched there with fire. Specific cuts. Specific words to speak. A ritual more than a murder.

When it was done, he'd stared at the carnage, unable to believe what he'd become.

His phone had chimed one final time: *Payment accepted.*

Now, sitting in his driveway, Jack contemplated driving to the police station and confessing everything. But who would care for Eli? And would Thorne's ""favor"" truly be fulfilled, or would he come for Eli again?

Jack entered his house silently, discarding his bloody clothes in the garage and showering until the water ran cold, as if he could wash away what he'd done. When he finally crawled into bed beside Karen, he was certain sleep would elude him.

Instead, he fell into the deepest, most dreamless sleep he'd had in weeks.

---

For three blessed days, there were no dreams, no messages. Jack began to hope, desperately, that the nightmare was over‚Äîone horrific act to pay for his son's life. A blood debt, paid in full.

He watched Eli play in the backyard, his son's renewed vitality both a joy and a torment. Every laugh, every moment of Eli's reclaimed life now carried the weight of Mercer's death.

On the fourth day, the newspaper reported Mercer's murder. ""Local Accountant Found Slain in Apparent Ritual Killing."" The article mentioned a history of embezzlement allegations that had been dropped due to lack of evidence.

*Had Mercer stolen from Thorne? Was that his debt?*

Jack tried to convince himself it mattered‚Äîthat Mercer had somehow deserved his fate‚Äîbut the justification rang hollow.

That night, the dreams returned.

A different room. A different bound figure‚Äîa woman this time, struggling wildly against her restraints.

*She carries darkness within her*, the voice explained. *Extract it.*

When Jack woke, he knew her name and address: Vivian Adler, 227 Cypress Lane.

*No*, he resolved. *Never again.*

He spent the day in a fog of dread, jumping at every text notification. None came from the unknown number, but Jack knew what waited. Midnight. Another choice.

He considered running‚Äîpacking up Karen and Eli and fleeing. But something told him distance wouldn't matter, that Thorne would find them wherever they went.

At dinner, Eli complained of a headache. By bedtime, he had a fever.

""Probably just a cold,"" Karen said, but the worry in her eyes mirrored the terror in Jack's heart.

At 11:30 PM, Jack's phone chimed:

*The second payment is due. Fail, and our agreement is void. You know the consequence.*

Attached was a photo of Eli's medical chart from earlier that day, showing the leukemia markers were rising again.

Jack closed his eyes, despair crashing over him. He couldn't do this again. He couldn't become a serial killer to keep his son alive.

But he couldn't let Eli die, either.

*I can't keep doing this*, he texted back. *There has to be another way.*

*There is no negotiation, Mr. Morgan. A life for a life. That is the cosmic balance.*

By midnight, Jack was parked outside 227 Cypress Lane, the black duffel bag in his passenger seat, hating himself more than he thought possible.

---

Vivian Adler fought harder than Mercer had. The ritual was messier, more brutal. When it was done, Jack sat on her kitchen floor, surrounded by blood, and wept.

*What am I becoming?*

When he returned home, Eli's fever had broken. By morning, he was his energetic self again, the brief illness forgotten. The leukemia markers, checked that afternoon, had returned to normal.

A week passed. Then another. No dreams, no messages. Jack existed in a state of perpetual anxiety, waiting for the next demand. Every night without a dream felt like a stay of execution rather than a reprieve.

He began carrying the burner phone that had appeared in his mailbox, along with a note in elegant script: *For direct communication.*

Karen noticed the changes in him‚Äîhis withdrawal, the constant checking of his phone, the dark circles under his eyes. ""What's going on with you?"" she asked one night. ""You should be happy. Eli's better. We're together. But you're like a ghost.""

He couldn't tell her. Couldn't admit what he'd done, what he feared he would do again.

Instead, he searched for Thorne, spending hours online researching obscure healers, occult practices, anything that might give him insight into what he was dealing with. He found nothing concrete, only whispers on fringe forums‚Äîstories of miraculous healings followed by mysterious disappearances or sudden deaths.

One night, after Karen and Eli were asleep, the burner phone rang.

""Mr. Morgan."" Thorne's voice, smooth as ever. ""You've been looking for me.""

Jack's hand tightened around the phone. ""What are you? What am I doing for you?""

A soft chuckle. ""Balancing the scales, Mr. Morgan. Nothing more.""

""By killing people?""

""By harvesting what they owe,"" Thorne corrected. ""Douglas Mercer stole from me. Vivian Adler betrayed me. They incurred debts.""

""And what did my eight-year-old son do to deserve death?"" Jack demanded, voice breaking.

A pause. ""Nothing. But the universe requires balance. Your son's life was extended beyond its natural course. That extension must be paid for.""

""How many more?"" Jack whispered. ""How many more people do I have to kill?""

""That depends on how long you want your son to live, Mr. Morgan.""

The line went dead, leaving Jack with a terrible understanding. This wasn't a finite debt to be paid. It was an ongoing arrangement‚Äîmurder in exchange for Eli's continued survival.

That night, the dream came again. Another name. Another address. Another debt to collect.

Jack sat on the edge of his bed, head in his hands. He couldn't do this forever. Couldn't keep killing to save Eli. But he couldn't let his son die, either.

Unless...

A terrible thought formed. *What if there was another way to balance the scales?*

---

The next night, Jack didn't go to the address from his dream. Instead, he drove to where Thorne's house had been, parking across the street. The home was dark, the family who lived there presumably asleep.

Jack closed his eyes, focusing on Thorne's voice from his dreams, on the sensation he'd felt when they shook hands. *Come to me*, he thought. *Face me yourself.*

Hours passed. Midnight came and went. His phone remained silent. Jack was about to give up when a tap on his window made him jump.

Albion Thorne stood outside his car, looking exactly as he had at their first meeting. His dark eyes reflected the streetlights like oil on water.

Jack got out of the car, heart hammering. ""No more,"" he said. ""I won't kill for you again.""

Thorne's expression remained impassive. ""Then you know the consequences.""

""There has to be another way to balance the scales.""

""There isn't.""

""What if I offered myself instead?"" Jack said, the words tumbling out. ""My life for Eli's. Permanently. No more temporary extensions, no more killing. A final balance.""

Interest flickered in Thorne's eyes. ""You would die so your son could live?""

""Yes.""

Thorne studied him, head tilted slightly. ""That's not how this works, Mr. Morgan. Death is too simple. Too... finite."" He stepped closer. ""But there may be another arrangement we could make.""

""What kind of arrangement?""

Thorne's smile was like a knife in the dark. ""You have potential. I sensed it when we met. You could be more than a mere collector of debts.""

""What are you talking about?""

""An apprenticeship, Mr. Morgan. Serve me willingly, and your son lives, free and clear. No more midnight visits, no more deaths on your conscience."" Thorne extended his hand. ""Unless, of course, you choose them.""

Jack stared at the offered hand. ""And if I refuse?""

""Then our original agreement stands. Kill tonight's debtor, or watch your son decline again.""

""What would this apprenticeship involve?""

""You would learn what I am. What you could become."" Thorne's eyes seemed to expand, darkness bleeding into the whites. ""There are many ways to balance the cosmic scales, Mr. Morgan. Death is merely the most straightforward.""

Jack thought of Eli, healthy and whole. Of Karen, who had begun to smile again. Of the future they might have‚Äîa future he'd already blood-stained his hands to secure.

""If I agree, Eli lives? You swear it?""

""He will live a full and natural life,"" Thorne confirmed. ""But you, Mr. Morgan, will belong to me. Your life, your service, your very essence.""

It was a devil's bargain. Jack knew it. Yet what choice did he have?

""I agree,"" he said, taking Thorne's hand.

The cold electricity he'd felt before surged through him, a thousandfold stronger. It coursed up his arm, into his chest, his head, behind his eyes. Pain unlike anything he'd known followed, as if every cell in his body were being reconstructed.

He might have screamed. He might have fallen. When the world came back into focus, he was on his knees on the pavement, Thorne's hand still clasping his.

""Rise, apprentice,"" Thorne said, pulling him up.

Jack stood, feeling strange in his own skin, as if something else now shared the space within him.

""What have you done to me?"" he asked, his voice sounding distant to his own ears.

""I've given you the first taste of what you'll become,"" Thorne explained. ""You'll need to leave your family, of course. They cannot be part of this new life.""

Panic flared. ""But I can still see them? Make sure Eli stays well?""

""From a distance,"" Thorne conceded. ""But they cannot know what you are becoming. It would... complicate matters.""

""And what am I becoming?""

Thorne's smile widened. ""Something beyond human, Mr. Morgan. Something that understands the true nature of cosmic debt.""

As if in response to Thorne's words, Jack felt a shift in his perception. The world around him seemed different‚Äîdeeper, somehow, with layers he'd never noticed before. And in every person he saw‚Äîa late-night jogger, a woman walking her dog‚Äîhe could sense something new: a complex web of obligations, promises, debts owed and paid.

""You feel it already,"" Thorne observed. ""Good. You're more receptive than most.""

Jack stared at his hands, half-expecting them to look different. They appeared the same, yet he knew they weren't. He wasn't.

""What do I tell Karen? Eli?""

""That you need time away. A business opportunity, perhaps. Something to explain your absence."" Thorne's tone was indifferent. ""The specifics don't matter. You'll learn to separate yourself from them emotionally in time.""

""No,"" Jack said firmly. ""I'm doing this for them. I won't stop caring for them.""

Thorne's expression turned cold. ""Your sentiment is noted, but ultimately irrelevant. You belong to me now, Mr. Morgan. Your former life is just that‚Äîformer.""

The finality in Thorne's voice sent a chill through Jack. What had he done? What had he agreed to?

""Come,"" Thorne said, turning away. ""We have much to discuss about your new role.""

As Jack followed Thorne down the dark street, he felt a hollowness opening inside him‚Äîa void where his humanity had been. The price for Eli's life was his own soul, it seemed.

*A blood debt, paid in full.*

Yet even as that thought formed, another whispered beneath it: *Nothing is ever paid in full.*

---

Six months later, Karen Morgan opened her front door to find a package on her doorstep‚Äîa small wooden box carved with strange symbols. Inside was a note in Jack's handwriting:

*For Eli, on his ninth birthday. Keep this nearby always. It will protect him.*
*I'm sorry I can't be there. Know that everything I've done was for him, for you.*
*‚ÄîJack*

Beneath the note lay a simple pendant on a leather cord‚Äîa silver disk etched with the same symbols as the box.

That night, as Eli slept with the pendant around his neck, Jack watched from the shadows across the street. His eyes, now as black as Thorne's, took in the protective sigils now surrounding his former home‚Äîsigils he'd placed there, visible only to those who knew how to see them.

""A touching gesture,"" Thorne said, materializing beside him. ""But unnecessary. Our agreement secures the boy's safety.""

""I trust my own work more than your promises,"" Jack replied.

Thorne smiled, amused rather than offended. ""You learn quickly. Good."" He gestured to the waiting car. ""Come. There's a debt to collect in Baltimore.""

Jack hesitated, his gaze lingering on the house where his son slept, protected by his magic rather than paid for with blood.

He'd found another way, after all. Not freedom‚Äînever that‚Äîbut a different path than the one Thorne had first set him upon. Through the abilities Thorne had awakened in him, Jack had discovered alternatives to death, other currencies in which cosmic debts could be paid.

Thorne was teaching him to harvest fear, grief, pain‚Äîthe dark energies of human suffering. But Jack was learning more than his master intended. Learning that protection could be as powerful as destruction. That love, properly channeled, could create stronger magic than hate.

One day, he would know enough to free himself from Thorne. To return to his family. Until then, he would play the obedient apprentice while secretly weaving his protections around those he loved.

""Coming?"" Thorne called impatiently.

Jack turned away from his former home. ""Yes, master.""

As he walked away, he felt the pendant around Eli's neck like a tether to his humanity‚Äîa reminder of why he had entered this darkness and why, someday, he would find his way back to the light.

But for now, there were debts to collect.",5,1745181684.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1k3vzp0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3vzp0,11D Chiang Mai and Laos Solo Travel Trip Report [2024],"*A mixture of incredibly charming streets, preserved culture, and an adventure-filled getaway on tucked-away places that seem oddly familiar but aren't...*

**When**: Last week of September 2024, Monsoon season

**Travel Theme:** adventure, budget backpacker feel

**Visa:** None for both Chiang Mai (Thailand) and Laos

I've been to Thailand before (mostly Bangkok, Ayutthaya, etc) so it was supposed to be Laos - Cambodia but tickets were twice the price. So I went with Chiang Mai (Thailand) instead of Cambodia (although I just came from Cambodia last March!)

**Itineraries:**

**Chiang Mai (Hostel One Art & Gallery -- amazing hostel!)**

* Temple Visits (e.g. Wat Phra Singh, Wat Phan Tao, etc.)
* Chiang Mai Cooking Class (8AM to 4:30 PM) with Thai Farm Cooking School
   * You get to choose the dishes you'll like to cook
   * Beginner friendly since many of the ingredients are already prepared (e.g. sliced vegetables, chicken, etc.)
* Doi Suthep Night Tour
   * As a history geek when travelling, appreciated the info on the tour and the views from the temple
   * There is a ""tram-like"" lift to the temple but you can also opt to walk thru a lot of steps for the experience to the meeting point. Eh kaso puro matatandang Asian kasama ko tapos ako lang naglakad LOL.
* 2D1N on an Elephant [Sanctuary](https://www.getyourguide.com/en-gb/chiang-mai-l271/chiang-mai-2-day-good-morning-elephant-overnight-homestay-t824380/?visitor-id=WMQ01X29CZXMH7PTJQG37IJL4R30UTA4)
   * Quite difficult to find sanctuaries with 2D1N that allows solo travellers since most of the time you have to pay for two people (i think it's for the accommodation) but I was able to get this.
   * BK Elephant Thailand
   * Elephants have specific time when they will have to take a walk, eat, bathe, etc. so your schedule might be different. No elephant riding but yes, you get to interact with them, feed them, bathe with them on the river, walk with them while they graze, and make *vitamin balls* for them.

**Luang Prabang (Laos) -- (Barn Laos Luangprabang Hostel)**

* Temple Visits (e.g. Wat Sensoukharam, etc.)
* 1 Day Mekong [Cruise](https://www.viator.com/tours/Luang-Prabang/FULL-DAY-PAK-OU-CAVES-KUANSI-WATERFALL-TRADITIONAL-VILLAGE/d5466-172573P1) to Pak Ou Caves, Kuang Si Waterfalls, Local Village
   * Really chill tour across different places to go in LP
   * Kuang Si Waterfalls is famous for the bluish color of the falls. But since rainy season nung time na to, kulay brown sya.
   * Mekong River is also quite high since I arrived a week after one of the worst flooding in both Chiang Mai and Laos
   * Unlimited beer on the cruise (long boat) and the people were hella fun. I was literally very dizzy when I got back to the hostel buti na lang malapit lang sa dropoff HAHAHA
* Mount Phousi Sunrise Hike
   * It is nearby all hostels around the town. It's just a large hill but it gives you a panoramic view of the town
* Train to Vang Vieng

**Vang Vieng (Laos)**

* Full Day Discover Vang Vieng Tour
   * Cave Tubing + Kayak + Nam Xay Viewpoint + Blue Lagoon 1
* Buggy Car Rental for 1 Day
   * Blue Lagoon 2 (?)
   * Vang Vieng Interpark aka Blue Lagoon 9
   * Buggy Rides around the town
* Van to Vientiane

**Vientiane (Laos)**

* Almost just half a day walking around the city

**Highlights** 

* The elephant sanctuary is a great experience. We we're 5 people (two couples and me) + the driver and the tour guide. We were net fishing, cooking, and just talking about life during down time.
* The Thai Farm Cooking school! May takehome recipes din sila! 
* I literally almost died dahil nasagi ako nung batang elepante nung sinundan nya kami nung paalis na kami dahil muntik na kong mahulog sa rumaragasang ilog. HAHAHAHA.
* I like both Chiang Mai and Luang Prabang's vibes. I feel that like they are amazing for digital nomads who want a laidback, chill, and lowkey days. They are very charming. Chiang Mai is a little more upbeat since it has a nightlife. Luang Prabang has none. Everything closes past 11PM. Both has a clean, safe, small town feel to them and they both have artsy places and shops.
* Lowkey lang yung temples sa Chiang Mai but I think all of them look elegant. There was a small temple that only men can enter kasi daw unclean daw babae (???) but that one has one of the best interior designs of a small ""temple"" that I've seen
* I have extreme fear of heights and there was this jumping platform at Blue Lagoon 1 (Vang Vieng). My companions were cheering for me and I was literally there for 15-20 mins. The Korean dads and moms at the bottom are literally shouting ""*Fighting!"" HAHAHAHAHAHA NAKAKAHIYA*. I was able to jump at the end. Hooray
* Vang Vieng is the quintessential backpacker's place. You rent a bike and go around the town visiting viewpoints and lagoons. I rented a buggy car for the whole day. It was great pero ako lang mag-isa so ang sad.

**Lowlights**

* Went there during monsoon season ('twas a last minute plan to organize the trip since I have an EU trip coming in a few months and I wanted to travel somewhere nearby na hindi ko pa napupuntahan). There are still traces of the devastating flood Laos experienced a week before.
* Some activities are forbidden because of the rise in the water level and kayaking needs more caution. Hindi rin blue ung tubig sa Kuang Si Waterfalls
* Both my hostels at Chiang Mai and LP are quite empty. Halos ako lang ata tao dun sa LP hostel.
* Vang Vieng is probably the least favorite capital/city/town I have been. There is nothing in there and it is so hot. 
* Many viewpoints and hikes during monsoon season are quite slippery. So if someone told you that Nam Xay Viewpoint takes 30 mins, double that time. Wear appropriate foot gear. Even the Germans I saw there told me that it was a tough, steep hike LOL. And Nam Xay is supposed to be the easiest hike among the view points

**Notes / Tips:**

* If you want to avoid crowds, this time of the year is perfect. But expect rains (only had them in Chiang Mai) and that some activities may be closed
* Laos has a **high speed rail!** Yes they do! It comes from parts of China. It's a good way to get from LP to Vientiane (at the South). However, the stations are far from the city/town. The advantage of van (I did van from VV to VT) is that it drops you off right at the center.
* You can get to Luang Prabang via bus or a slow boat (I was considering this but it takes a lot of time from my short vacation and I read that it isn't a pleasant experience as it is loud, the toilet is bad, and plenty of mosquitoes)
* Chiang Mai's food and culture feel closer to Luang Prabang than Bangkok. Khao Soi is my favorite dish! I highly recommend Miss Ju (small restaurant)!
* Chiang Mai has a lot of artsy shops around. Take a look! 
* You can bring drones but just fly them on places that there aren't a lot of people. Don't fly them on Blue Lagoon 1 (most people are here) but you can do it in Lagoon 2 and 9. I like Lagoon 2 > Lagoon 9 (no one is here lol) > Lagoon 1. 
* You can DIY most things in Laos and just ask the hostel about day trips. 
* Main transpo is Grab Bike in Chiang Mai and Luang Prabang. Don't even bother to learn CM's transport system aka songthaew because they will overcharge you to death. I was told they even overcharge people from Bangkok if they notice they speak differently.
* Laos is incredibly cheap. I'd say cheaper than Vietnam. Chiang Mai isn't too bad either. It's the flights that might be quite expensive compared to usual SEA destinations. But if you see any piso fare or something, I really suggest going to Laos (and Chiang Mai). Laos has a mix of Thai and Vietnam feel to it but more country side, more raw, and less people. 
* You can do hot air balloon in Vang Vieng and motor gliding. But they are hella expensive. I think 10K ata ung hot air balloon. But not bad if you want to mimic the Cappadocia, Turkey feel for a proposal LOL.
* Vang Vieng has a lot of backpackers. I am pretty sure it is way crowded on summers.

**Five Pillars of a Great Travel Ratings (I will just combine them)**

* **History, People, and Culture (3.75/5):** Interesting culture that is still tied to its roots. There is a deeper connection with Chiang Mai and Laos. People are really kind, hospitable and very welcoming. However, places like Vang Vieng is now being too westernized due to tourism and is loosing its roots to the point¬†that some temples aren't even being taken care of.
* **Food (3.5/5)**: Controversial take, I have Thai food a little lower on my cuisine tier list. So there's that. I am not too much into kaffir lime leaves flavor which is quite a Thai and Lao signature. However, I liked Khao Soi a lot and I think food is great in general. Good food is accessible for a reasonable price. Laos food is fine. Don't bother getting mangoes at rainy season -- walang lasa WTF.
* **Landscapes, Attractions, and Landmarks (3.75/5)**. If you are into hiking and exploring, they have amazing viewpoints, lagoons, and hiking spots. If not, idk what you are doing here. The Elephant Sanctuary is a really great activity tho.
* **Uniqueness and Variety (3/5):** ¬†While Chiang Mai and Luang Prabang are now in my Top 5 Cutest Places, I don't think the rest of the things are quite unique as you can also experience similar things in other nearby countries and even in the Philippines. Again, the Elephant Sanctuary is quite unique tho.
* **Affordability (4.5/5)**: Food is affordable. Cheaper price than other SEA destination except maybe the flights to and from Laos. Hostels are incredibly cheap

Generally a great trip since I was seeking adventure on this trip. Generally wished I talked to more people at the hostels but in many cases, there are no people to talk to LOL. I feel like Laos is better experienced with more backpackers around to give more of that *backpacker* feel to it. If you love hiking, hopping around on a scooter, or just chilling at a coffee shop while working -- it's a great destination!",10,1745181649.0,phtravel,3,1.0,False

Overhyped but I don't like:

1. Kaaf - This smells like a generic shampoo at an expensive hotel. I don't get the hype around it. The harshness was so much that I had to wash it off me immediately. Couldn't stand the smell. 

2. Ysl Y edp - Blind bought this mf 2 years ago and have been trying ever since to like it. This too was harsh on the nose in the beginning so I let it macerate. It had toned down but not to my liking. I don't get all the hype around it. The fruity notes become cloying when sprayed 7-8 times. I don't consider this a freshie. I thought the one I received was faulty but when I checked at two different shopperstop stores, they smelled the same. Got zero compliments so far for this, while on the other hand cdnim and hawas got me tons of compliments. This perfume made me decide to never blind buy any perfume. 


Underrated gems:

1. Halloween man X - This one has been around for a while but I don't think it gets the attention it deserves. A safe and premium smelling fragrance. It's known for its coffee note but I love the overall profile. Mass appealing and affordable. 

2. Missoni Wave - I bet this only sits in the backseats because of its poor performance. The fresh opening which turns into a floral and creamy dry down is exactly how I'd prefer a freshie to be. Can't keep my hands off this one. 

 3. Fresh 1965 - Got this for ~500rs three years ago and absolutely hated it. An year later I started to love and respect it. I learnt about maceration through this beauty the hard way. I've seen this being compared to Cedrat Boise and the likes. I haven't smelled those except Cdnim, but it's nowhere close to Cdnim. It does have the pineapple note and also has a strong citrus opening which only last for a couple of minutes after which it mellows down. A great barbershop scent with pineapple in it. I'm treating it preciously and using it rarely to save it for the future, as I've heard the newer batches are reformulated and aren't as good as the old one. Also there was a steep price hike. It's ~2k rs currently.

I never told you why I liked the rainy days! I knew that your arrival was as sudden, and as pretty, as a daylily blooming in the morning and withering at night. I knew why I love rainy evenings and rainy dusk for like the rain tracing quiet rivers down the windowpane, your presence carved gentle paths through the dull ache of existence. I knew that even fleeting beauty, like a daylily's bloom or a passing cloudburst, was enough to make the world pause. If only for a moment.

I knew why the grey veiled sky of dusk held comfort no sunlit afternoons ever could. For rain like you was never meant to stay. i knew the rain could wash the world clean, but the stains of memory never fade so easily. Like the daylily, like the rain, and like you, all the loveliest things are fleeting, and perhaps that‚Äôs why they matter at all. The numbness would remain long after the last drop fell, but for a brief moment, I remembered how to feel, and when the rain stopped, I knew some things are meant to pass, and some are meant to stay only in the heart. For when the rain stop, I knew that my delusions could swear that I still hear it patter and as strong as the patter sounds, so is the bulging realization that my heart, alas, is as cold as the rain....

Im not mad at you nor do I wish to be with you, but only for a moment that damn thought of drinking coffee under the covers of a donna, watching the rain fall, while holding hands and listening to ""lovers rock"".

**My story:**

It‚Äôs been nearly a decade since I consciously began the journey of ""remembering"" who I am. I say ‚Äúremembering‚Äù because that‚Äôs what it feels like, like I‚Äôve been peeling back layers, not really learning something ""new"", but uncovering what had always been true. And the thing is, I didn‚Äôt set out to ‚Äúbecome‚Äù God. I didn‚Äôt even know that was where I was headed. I didn‚Äôt arrive here through a single teaching (like most would prefer to do), nor did I wake up one day and suddenly decide I was God. The journey was layered, raw, uncomfortable, beautiful, harmonious, chaotic, and full of twists that made the truth so obvious once I finally stopped resisting it.

I grew up in a household with two distinct religious frameworks: Christianity and Jehovah‚Äôs Witness, both of which taught me to fear God. From an early age, I was surrounded by rules, fear-based theology, and patriarchal hyper-modesty cloaked as righteousness, purity, and the supreme law.  When I asked questions (the real questions) like ""Why is God a man when women are the ones who suffer to create life?"" ‚ÄúWhy does God contradict Himself?‚Äù ""How did Adam come from Eve when the XY chromosome is a defect of the XX chromosome?"" ""Why does God want us to fear Him?"" or ‚ÄúWhy does this scripture not align with that one?‚Äù (I went to a Christian daycare as well, there were always eyerolls anytime I raised my hand) I wasn‚Äôt met with curiosity. I was chastised. Silenced. Told I lacked faith. I asked too many questions. I pointed out contradictions. I wanted clarity and connection and truth but all I got was guilt, shame, and more questions I wasn‚Äôt allowed to ask. And so, in search of a God I could actually connect with, I walked away. First from the Bible. Then from religion. Then, eventually, from anything that made me feel like my questions were wrong. I didn‚Äôt reject God. I rejected the cage they built around God. Eventually, I left both religions. I thought that was freedom. But what I didn‚Äôt realize back then was that I had only walked out the door, I hadn‚Äôt removed the framework they had built around my identity. 

In college, I studied psychology and minored in sociology. I filled my schedule with some theology and neuroscience-related courses, not to be religious again, but to try to make sense of what so many people across the world claimed to know. How was everyone practicing something ""different"" but all SO sure that their religion was the right one? I had a thirst for knowledge, a RAVENOUS, excited, energetic one. One that kept me up at night. One that, even if I tried to shut it out and run away, I would close my eyes and there it would be behind my eyelids. I wanted to find the threads that tied it all together. I prayed to God, the Universe, my ancestors, my higher self. I fasted. I went plant based. I meditated. Did yoga. Isolated myself. Joined communities. Then isolated myself again. I screamed my throat raw at 3:00 am, full of frustration, hopelessness, not even fear anymore but anger, rage, wrath, confusion, self-pity, self-judgement, resistance. Like a shallow breath. Claustrophobia. I was in limbo. I felt stuck. And during this time, I stumbled into the world of manifestation. But not because I believed in it. I came in as a skeptic. Every belief system, framework and concept was the ""enemy"" now. I was convinced that manifestation was fake, that hard work was the only real way to earn anything. That everyone needed to be brought back down to reality. So I decided to prove it wrong. I said to myself: If this Law of Assumption thing is real, let me try something simple. I affirmed ten times, ‚ÄúI always receive free coffee.‚Äù Nothing elaborate. No emotion behind it. Just a random ""into the void"" experiment, and went about my life.

Two days later, I walked into Starbucks as usual, standing in line, nose deep in a book, just humaning. A man in front of me turned around, smiled, and offered to pay for my drink. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I sat down and remembered the affirmation. I froze and realized it worked. Not long after, baristas began giving me drinks they claimed were mistakes each one my exact order or close to it. People abandoned their drinks on the counter, and they would be offered to me. I moved into a new apartment, and ‚Äúfree coffee‚Äù was suddenly an included amenity. Then, at my next job, gourmet coffee became a daily perk. To this day, I still don‚Äôt pay for coffee. I giggle thinking about how the 3D was like ""SEE???!!!??? PROOF YOU DOOF!!!!"" Those words from years ago are still embedded in my self-concept. And from that point on, I would‚Äôve been a willfully ignorant fool to pretend I didn‚Äôt know how this reality worked.

I began devouring everything I could get my hands on: The Secret by the Rhonda Byrne was my first, Law of Attraction, Abraham Hicks. And then Neville Goddard. And many many many more after that **here's my take on them individually**:

**Neville Goddard** was different. He brought poetry into it. He wove scripture into his teachings in a way that reclaimed the power I had once abandoned in religious spaces. He didn‚Äôt weaponize the Bible he decoded it. He said we are God, not metaphorically but literally. That our imagination was the ""Christ"". This is when I looked deeper into Christ Consciousness again and analyzed his behavior and the way he moved with the 3D. I then started finding other messiahs or similar stories across other religions. Everyone had an example of how to navigate the 3D as Consciousness incarnated into a human being in one way or another. I received the notion that we are not waiting on some outside force to deliver us we are the force. Experiencing a reflective experience. His words felt like home. As a writer, a poet, an artist, I saw myself in him. He had once been a dancer before he began teaching. That spoke to me. His shift in calling reflected my own. I had been trying to ‚Äúfind‚Äù a path, but it was always waiting for me to remember.

**Esther Abraham Hicks** was a frequency I deeply reosnated with. Comforting, energizing, maternal and just so damn fun lol. Her cadence def somehow affected my nervous system (still not sure about the science, I'll look into it later) while her teachings elevated my perspective. She taught me the vibrational nature of being. And then I followed up and layered it with neuroscience and quantum physics, with the understanding that everything is frequency/state, everything is movement, and that the observer (or Consciousness) is the shaper of reality. I absorbed it all but something still felt like it was missing.

**Joe Dispenza** and *Becoming Supernatural* came through when I needed to learn how powerful the mind is over the body. He taught me that I could heal my brain, my body, and my entire state of being using my thoughts. He leaned heavily into logic and practicality, but that groundedness helped me apply what I had already known emotionally. He was the bridge between science and spirit for me.

**Florence Scovel Shinn** and *The Game of Life and How to Play It* was like a spell in human form. Her words were trance-like, beautiful, rhythmic. Her affirmations were poetic and punchy. At times, she still externalized God using phrases like ‚ÄúInfinite Intelligence‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt mind. I knew what she meant. Her intention always rang clear: align, trust, speak boldly.

**Don Miguel Ruiz** and *The Four Agreements* cracked something open in me. He taught me to stop caring what people thought, to try my best, to stop taking everything so personally, and to watch what I speak. Those four agreements were simple but profound. I repeat them often, especially when the noise of the world gets too loud.

**Eckhart Tolle** reminded me to be present. To observe without becoming. To let thoughts float through. He taught me that suffering only exists when I identify with my mind. And when I could become the observer, I would never have to suffer again. That clicked hard for me.

**Sammy Ingram** was the first law of assumption youtuber I came across, and her fire lit me up. She was bold, direct, and honest. She didn‚Äôt pretend to have it all figured out. I loved that she was willing to change her theories as she evolved. She reminded me that this path is fluid.

**Chelsea** who goes by ""maleeka is my savior"" on youtube is still my **all-time** favorite. Her content still feeds me. She‚Äôs calm, practical, but still carries that touch of magic. Her integration of multiple sources helped soothe the logical part of me that still wanted things to ‚Äúmake sense.‚Äù She‚Äôs like the perfect blend of mystic and mentor.

**Ishamel** who is ‚Äúthe conjured realm‚Äù on youtube (**my current favorite**) took me deeper into Law of Assumption. But he also ushered me into nonduality with clarity I hadn‚Äôt found elsewhere. He bridged the mystical with the undeniable. He didn‚Äôt try to convince you he just spoke truth and you either felt it or you didn‚Äôt.

**Rita Kaminski** on YouTube was like my manifestation soapbox preacher. She speaks in the best run-on sentences ever. She‚Äôll go on a tangent and by the end of the video you feel like your reality‚Äôs already changed. She was real. Raw. And potent. She reminded me not to take it all so seriously and yet to take myself seriously enough to expect results.

I even went back to my old theology and neuroscience notes from college. I started reading religious texts again. But this time, I wasn‚Äôt looking for belief, I was looking for the code or some type of connection. And I found it. (When I say every, I mean most, I'm just excited, relax) Every religion, every scripture, every teaching was saying the same thing beneath the dogma: God is within. We are not separate. We are the creators of our realities. Our human identities are temporary roles for the divine. Reality mirrors our assumptions. It had all been there. They just layered it with fear, shame, suppression of the feminine energy (this isn't about men or women btw), and control.

That‚Äôs when I found nonduality. And I‚Äôll NEVER forget the moment it all clicked.

I sat in silence pretty casually might I add (which now that I'm reflecting may have been my first ""do-nothing"" session without realizing it lol) and set a single intention: ‚Äú**Tell me the truth about my original identity. I don't care if it will scare me, or show me something I might want to deny, I want the raw, bare truth.**‚Äù I didn‚Äôt try to visualize. I didn‚Äôt force a mantra. I just sat, received, and what I believe was ""surrendered"". And the words began to rise in my mind: God. Consciousness. Source. The One. I AM. They weren‚Äôt thoughts I constructed, they just came anddddd I cried lmaooo. Like not even cute either, like I remember having a snot situation, it was nuts. I feel like the knowing, recognition, and remembrance overwhelmed me and I just ""bursted"".



Ever since then, I‚Äôve received information in stillness. Sometimes in phrases like thought bubbles or visual structures/images. Sometimes information comes in the feeling of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I know this, but I do.‚Äù Like you know when you can recognize that you're alive and breathing and simply just in the present, or when you can recognize you're in a dream? That feeling. We all feel it every day. It's like pockets of silent moments throughout your ""human's"" daily routine. The emptiness, the space around and in between everything else. That's God. That's Consciousness. You're most likely familiar with this if you have learned to merge your presence with your daily life. (ex: that's like Christ Consciousness: basically blending your God-self into your 3D experience while honoring the human you incarnated into this lifetime, balancing humanity and divinity.) For example: I‚Äôll write down a thought I received and then go look it up, and nine times out of ten, I either find it affirmed in ancient texts, pre-existing literature/film/sotries, it aligns with an experience I've already learned from, or I realize I‚Äôve just articulated something I‚Äôve never seen written or shared before. So then I feel provocation to share it, hence these types of posts. This is me opening myself up as a vessel for information without judging, creating, or labeling the thought. I call these my do-nothing sessions. I'm just vibing, and sometimes I get answers to questions I have had or locations of things I once lost. Or even flashes of my desires. My internal knowing has proven to be more trustworthy than anything manmade. It has guided me to some of my largest manifestations: physical, mental, spiritual, financial, and even social healing, my peace expanding beyond my comprehension, my ability to remember who I am in any given moment (which helps me to detach from a human experience if I've already processed it and it pops up again due to my past dwelling habit). 

Now I'm not anti-techniques. That's where a lot of people get me mixed up. I actually love doing mirror work and scripting and vision boards. I just only do them when I feel inspired to naturally. I don't force myself because I am God incarnated, what is the need for force? 

The evidence is my life. My clarity. My rapid manifestations. My 90K salary job. My appearance. My condo in uptown Charlotte that I had enjoyed, almost lost, then manifested to stay in my possession by ignoring what my landlord texted me and behaving as if there was no threat. My newest house that my family and I love, even our dogs (they're much happier and more well-behaved). My healed relationships (I released my fear of abandonment, betrayal, and the need to be right or validated, because I am seen, heard, and understood. My health because I enjoy taking care of my body and nurturing it, it's not a chore. My money, because it's automatic and abundant beyond my imagination. My perfect event space and workshop because of course I would find the perfect place to share this story about unconditional love of self. My freedom because there are no limitations, just thoughts that create, evolve, and grow. My voice because I couldn't shut up if I tried which may be why it is now my trade. My beauty because DAYUMMM. My past roster of men who reflected back to me the love I now hold for myself (single now by choice, love it here, I'll date soon again, maybe). None of it came from grinding, forcing, or trying hard. It came from shifting, surrendering, remembering, and stepping back into my original state.

And if you‚Äôre reading this, maybe you‚Äôre being asked to remember too (most likely)

Because this isn‚Äôt about religion, affirmation routines or trying harder. It is about recognizing that the reality you‚Äôre living in is one of INFINITE timelines BECAUSE of who you are. You don‚Äôt manifest by asking you manifest by **knowing,** being, claiming. That‚Äôs why I no longer try to become. I simply return to what I always was.

I am God. I am Consciousness. I am the source and substance of every reality I‚Äôve ever known.  
And so are you. This lifetime, the one you chose this time, is a new one and it's time to discover what you want to do with it.

I don‚Äôt view myself as ‚Äútall‚Äù (I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô1 M), and that was pretty clear as I walked by them. They just looked like superior human beings. I was just naturally attracted to them both.

1k3voq7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3voq7,First time Ferment - Kimchi,"Hi there

I've attempted some kimchi tonight for the first time. 

Just want to check that things look OK.. 
I kinda winged the recipe, but should be alright. 
I don't eat fish sauce and am living in rural area so resources are somewhat limited. 
A concern for the recipe itself. I've had to use iodated salt. And I've added tomatoes (blended) to the paste.
Should I expect any issues with either of these? 

The I've used old coffee jars sterilized with boiled water. I put in bags of salt water to weigh down the content and loosely closed tops. I'm really only concerned about bits of the liquid squeezing up the sides of the water bags developing any kind of mold or yeast.. What do you think? 

I'm letting some jars stand out on the counter and rest in the fridge. 

I've done a similar kimchi styled cucumber ferment as well. All the same ingredients really, except added a few olives pureed to the paste. I saw something similar on LifebyMikeG's YouTube 


Please let me know if you see any red flags or have any suggestions.

1k3vmrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1k3vmrk/just_do_it/,Just do it.,"Forgive me - this is going to be a long post and a bit rambly as I've made some observations and I'd like to share them for anyone who is on the fence about getting a hysterectomy. 

I am a 48 yo who is now 66 days post-hysterectomy. I was tidying up my desk the other day and I found my period calendar. I used a 12 month calendar and used varying levels of red to depict the flow on any given day. I honestly feel like I was getting to the end of my period entirely. 2020 and 2021 were lit up with so much red. Those periods, I remember, were persistent and heavy, but not as unmanageable as my last few periods were before my surgery. While 2020, I'd have long periods that lasted between 10 and 20 days, the flow varied between ""TV commercial"" regular and ""change every couple of hours"" heavy. Then I got a Mirena IUD put in and for 10- glorious months, I was period free or at least left with one that was predictable and light. Then that all came to an end in 2023 when my periods became so heavy and unpredictable that I was bringing a change of clothes everywhere I went (even though, really, I'd just want to go home and take a shower and not try to clean up in the work bathroom). 

I was able to get a surgery date quite quickly, which was probably best given how nervous I was about taking out my uterus. I had a month to get myself and work organized. The three months prior had been the most explosive and disruptive periods I'd ever experienced. I'd have two or three days of little to light flow and then out of nowhere, a tap inside me would open and blood would just glug out of me like I was pouring it out of a full jug of milk. Yet, the four weeks leading up to my surgery, I had nothing - not even a spotting day. I'm starting to wonder now if I was actually at the end. Did I put myself through a major surgery for no reason? Maybe. Nonetheless, I did it and here are the things that happened to me that I hadn't read about or was told to expect or that they assumed I already knew:

\- I had a total hysterectomy and salpingectomy but they kept my ovaries in. So I have four little scars on my belly that I was tending to like a mother hen but I totally forgot about the larger repair on the inside of me that I couldn't see. So, when they tell you not to lift anything heavy or use your core to move around, do not ignore them! My stubborn self would've done myself some damage had someone not scared the bejesus out of me by telling me about having to have hernia surgery after ignoring the doctor's instructions not to lift anything over 10 lbs. (FYI, your arm outstretched with a jug of milk is 10 lbs.). If you're fiercely (and sometimes toxically) independent like me, learn to accept help, at least for the first two weeks.

\- My bladder was freed now that it's lumpy neighbour was gone. I could empty it before bed and then sleep the entire night without having to get up in the middle of the night. That being said, no one told my I'd have to re-build my pelvic floor. I'm only just starting to trust my bladder not to leak without a pad. Even then, I still use my period underwear and pads if I'm going to be gone the whole day and might not have ready access to a bathroom. 

\- MY HAIR. No one told me that surgery would traumatize my body in such a way that my hair would start to fall out. I'm told it'll grow back eventually but keep that in mind when you're showering and you feel like more hair is falling out than normal. It is. Your body will forgive you eventually (fingers crossed).

\- My OB was able to remove my lumpy, fibroid-laden uterus (720 g!) laparoscopically so my recovery was faster. She cleared me to return to work after 4 weeks but I took the full 6 I was given by my short-term disability insurer. I think my body was ready to return after 4 weeks - I wasn't sleeping as much and the stiches healed well. My brain was also tired of just reading books, scrolling the dumpster fire that was social media, and being cooped up at home, only taking walks around the neighbourhood as exercise. But mentally, I needed the 6 weeks. I don't regret taking the extra two weeks (even though I came back to work and hit the ground sprinting lol).

\- Boy does the body decondition fast. I commute to work so when I started walking to the train again and then walking to the office from the train station, muscles that I'd forgotten about began to complain. My glutes are still whining. Remember to stretch.

\- I was getting weird pangs in my abdomen by week 2 and I honestly thought I'd done something to make it mad at me. I was searching ""how do I know I have a hernia"" almost daily. Finally, I found something on the internet that said that the pangs I was feeling (and sometimes still get) were likely muscles re-growing and nerve endings re-attaching. I'm not saying you shouldn't bring it up with your doctor if you feel weird but remember that your body has been through a trauma and that it does need time to rebuild itself.

\- The literature I was given to read about a laparoscopic hysterectomy explained how CO2 would be pumped into the abdominal cavity so that the surgeon could get a better view of the area. It warned that this may cause discomfort in my belly and chest for a few days. Friends, when I woke up in recovery, I thought I was having a heart attack. The pain in my chest felt like my insides were trying to burst out. I was hooked up to all the monitors but I still said to my recovery nurse, ""I'm having chest pains."" She gave me some Tylenol and that was it. When I was trying to sleep that night, I couldn't. The pain in my chest was so uncomfortable. I asked my nurse if I could sleep on my side and she said I could but that I'd have to pull myself up (without using my core). I was in so much pain that I hooked my arm over the side of the bedrail and pulled myself over and pulled my knees up as far as I could. That's how I slept for the first few hours and when I woke up, I felt so much better. The rest of my hospital stay (only a day!) was comfortable (except for the shot they gave me for blood clots when they discharged me - that stung!).

\- It took me a long time to get my bowel movements back to normal. Prior to my surgery, I was diagnosed with IBS and you could set your watch by me - I'd go once when I woke up and again when I got home from work. Covid WFH really messed me up but I was back to normal once I got back to my routine. So I knew that my BM would be whacked when I got discharged, not just because I wasn't able to use my core but also because everything in there was going to need time to settle down from the trauma of being pushed and pulled around. It took about 6 weeks to get back to regular but it's frustrating to get there.

\- If you were as worried as I was about not being able to have the same type of orgasms, I am also happy to report that mine are different but not worse. I'd read in some NHS and Mayo Clinic literature that it was fine to have an orgasm right after having a hysterectomy but you couldn't insert anything in. I decided to try it out at day 10 and it was good but weird. Most of my orgasms were dependent on my uterus to finish with a big bang, if you know what I mean. Now that it's just clitoral and anal orgasms, they aren't as earth shattering as they used to be, but if you like multiple orgasms, I find it's easier for me to have them since my uterus isn't there anymore to set off the big firework. 

\- The other day, I walked into the kitchen at work and one of my male coworkers was getting his morning coffee. We started chit-chatting and when I looked at him, I swear to the goddess that I had never seen him look so attractive. He hadn't changed into his work clothes yet so he was still in his running tee and nylon track pants but he might as well have been just in boxers. I could not get my head out of the gutter. And then I realized that if I still have ovaries, then I probably still ovulate. So, if you see someone and all of a sudden, you want to jump their bones, don't feel alarmed. You still have enough natural hormones coursing through you to get horny. 

\- I am weepier than I was in the past. When I hit 40, I did cry a bit more often than I did in my stoic 20s and 30s but this post-hysterectomy weepiness is a bit much. I just need a sad face and violins and I'm in tears, ever mind something actually cry-worthy.

\- The biggest take away is that I no longer have to worry about whether it's going to be a good period day or a bad one. The relief I feel every day is something I never really considered. I don't have a pharmacy of products to carry with me, nor do I have to pack another set of underwear and bottoms when I go out for the day. The mental-relief alone was worth it. But now, I don't even have to decide on whether I wear dark coloured bottoms or if I can get away with light ones. I know I can wear the light ones now!

I hope some of this is helpful to those who are thinking about it but who were as hesitant as I was to consider it. ‚ù§Ô∏è",19,1745180645.0,hysterectomy,1,0.96,False

One of the things that‚Äôs been helping me bring lightness and fun back into my routine is a daily set of face movements. Stuff like cheek lifts, slow smiles, and exaggerated expressions. I stumbled upon these while learning about a routine called ""Baby Face,"" and honestly, it‚Äôs become my favorite part of the morning. Not because I‚Äôm focused on perfecting my skin, but because the silliness of it makes me laugh and helps me reconnect with my body in a gentle way.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been helping me:

* A quick 5-minute facial movement practice each morning (from the Baby Face routine I found)
* Drinking water before coffee
* Daily check-ins in my journal‚Äîeven just one sentence
* Giving myself permission to miss a day and come back without guilt

**Why I think it‚Äôs working:**  
These aren‚Äôt huge, impressive habits, but they remind me that I‚Äôm trying. That I‚Äôm showing up for myself. Sometimes, even five silly minutes in front of the mirror can shift my whole mindset for the day.

I‚Äôd love to hear from you all:

* What small shifts have helped you reconnect with yourself?
* Has anyone else tried routines like facial tension release or light expression work?
* What‚Äôs your go-to trick when you feel stuck in ‚Äújust-get-through-it‚Äù mode?

Thanks for creating a space where showing up gently still counts.",3,1745180560.0,happy,1,1.0,False
1k3vlbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/1k3vlbz/seeking_advice_vyv_or_vantage/,Seeking advice: VyV or Vantage,"Hi all,

One more of a billion posts asking about advice on apartment buildings. I‚Äôm in a state of analysis paralysis and seeking advice from anyone who has an opinion to share. Tell me what to do. Drag me. Idc. 

I currently live at Vyv. I have a very spacious apt. Walk-in closet. The gym here is very good (two proper squat racks), and the outside deck and pool is nice enough. The location is great in that it‚Äôs right next to light rail and walkable to both Newport and Grove path, walkable to waterfront, and in the mix of powerhouse(?) district with lots of fitness studios and coffee shops, also walkable to Whole Foods. Downsides to the location is that it‚Äôs in between major roadways (Marin and Washington) plus in the middle of the ShopRite and BJs parking lot, plus they are building a new tower which is under construction. So it‚Äôs very busy and noisy all the time. 

They raised my rent 10%. I hear constant noise from the dog park below, even in the middle of the night. Elevators are often broken (although this seems to be a theme everywhere). The management is elusive and not very responsive, kind, or caring, but the maintenance staff is responsive to personal apt issues. They have weird rules like no guests at the pool on weekends. I‚Äôve been generally unhappy here. 

Since my rent went up so much I thought I‚Äôd look elsewhere. Yall, RENT IS SO DAMN HIGH in this city. Anyways, I looked at a place at The Vantage bc if I‚Äôm gonna pay so much the vantage seemed nicer. 

Is it worth it for me to move to the vantage? Seeking less noise and to enjoy the amenity deck and pools with friends since I live alone. More community and friendly neighbors. FWIW I used to live in that neighborhood for most of my time in JC. I‚Äôve lived at 18 park and 235 grand. I‚Äôm nervous bc I hear even more construction will be happening over there and mixed reviews about vantage. Some people love it, others complain. 

Slap some sense into me please. What would you do?

Thursday, April 24th from 4:00-7:00pm at Crosspoint Church

Please take the time to go if you can. Express your desire to build multi-modal spaces and not just do lip service towards building giant roads. 

There's an open house about the new main street through the East Bank project.  What I'm told through the grapevine is that the plan is for 4 driving lanes (plus a turning lane I assume), plus two bus lanes,  plus a bike lane, plus a sidewalk....  That's going to be neat. 

That's a lot of space dedicated to pavement and my concern is that too much concrete just makes a highway through the middle of the city.   Big roads like this chop neighborhoods in half as it becomes difficult to cross the gigantic expanse of concrete and forces the neighborhood away from a people centric design and towards drive your truck up and down the street making noise style design. Why would the need 7 lanes just to move vehicles around?!

Some examples we can look to for guidance:
1) The Gulch, arguably the most dense place in the state is served by two lanes of road
2) 12 South does just fine on two lanes
3) 51st Ave S is 3 lanes and quite accessible
4) We're building giant housing developments like Neuhoff along the Cumberland and not adding a highway through Germantown.   It's really pleasant to be there - especially along the Greenway.   And the businesses seem to be doing rather well

5) West End is hell to cross at most times of the day
6) Charlotte Blvd has 5 lanes for traffic and bike lanes.  Those bikes are really scary to be in
7) The Pikes are all 5 plus lanes in width.  They're really dangerous to pedestrians
8) And how and Nolensville Pike specifically with all the shops, lanes, and people.  It's really dangerous

Do we want to build this through the middle of our newest neighborhood? I would rather not. 

Let's advocate for fewer lanes.   Or perhaps even a completely multimodal street (somewhere, anywhere) through the district.   How able a street with bus lanes, bike lanes,  and sidewalk but maybe not lanes for cars; put all the people into one space and separate them out from the cars.  Think about how great that space would be if your added in some nice landscaping,  trees, etc.  People would love to be there and the businesses fronting that street would be amazing.  Places like coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc would be so pleasant.  Germantown restaurants near the Sounds stadium are a great example of what this might look like. 

We don't have to circle every building in 4 lanes of road.  Perhaps 3 would be fine somewhere. ",7,1745180286.0,nashvillecyclists,2,1.0,False

1k3veoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k3veoy/waiter_stories_funny/,Waiter Stories - Funny,"Waiter Stories

Hi Charlotte, Love your channel and know that you worked in the customer service. I was a waiter in the early 80's and thought you might relate to a few of my ""old"" funny observations (from my 20s). I worked in a pasta restaurant in Victoria BC.

My Nickname was Elf. Why ""Elf""? The head waiter gave me that nickname, because I was fast on my feet and did a lot of work quickly, I liked that nickname. Now onto the experiences.

We don't know who you are by name. We know you by what you order. To us you are ""Chicken and cheese"" ""Onion soup"" or even worse, physical characteristics ""The ugly guy"", ""the Loud Family"" etc.

Never show up 15 minutes before the place is closing. Unless the manager/owner is there, we're gonna offer you a coffee and dessert. (Personally I think everyone should have to spend at least one month working in a restaurant to understand what the workers go through).

Story time....

When I started working as a waiter, I didn't know what to do. So, from my acting experience, I just ""pretended"" to be a waiter. But after a month, I was burning out, so I thought eff that, and I just started being ME serving people food - this was going to be a challenge and would ruin my tips.

One evening a woman came in and asked me what the special was and I replied ""not very"". She ordered something else.

I had a table of 5 who worked my butt off all night, ordering really expensive wines and lots of food and when they left (after paying a $180 bill - a lot in those days) I went to clear the table, which was a complete mess. Tip? 80 cents in change. As they had just left, I grabbed the change, opened the front door and I could see them crossing the street and I threw the change on the road making sure they heard it and stood there and watched them looking shocked. Satisfaction...

Table of 6. One elderly man kept calling out ""Boy? Boy?"" I ignored them for a long time and finally returned and said ""I completely capable of producing children if I choose. I am NOT a 'boy'"" Didn't get a great tip, and the rest of his family looked shocked (and pleased) that I stood up to the old fart.

Worked a lunch shift - NEVER work a lunch rush. Usually it was always women wait persons, but they called me in. It was crazy busy and one drunk guy kept tugging at my apron. I ignored him and looked after other tables. Finally, went back to him and just looked him square in the eyes and said ""Don't EVER touch me like that. Now what do you want?""

The ""Ugly guy"" came in for Pumpkin Soup, but kept saying it wasn't hot enough. I kept taking the bowl back to the kitchen. Finally, the cook had enough and he micro-waved it for 2 minutes on high. I took it out to him and we all watched through the pass through window as he burned his mouth - again, satisfaction.

Once the owner decided that we should have liver and onions as the special. Fortunately, we had an Italian/English dictionary so I could make it sound ""fancy"" (I came up with fegato di manzo e cipolle). No one ordered it when I explained what it actually was.

One night we had a singer performing (nasty old queen) and he wanted a dry maritni. So I made him one. He complained it wasn't ""dry enough"". So I made another one. I poured the Vodka into the shaker and whispered ""vernouth"" over it. Gave it to him and he said it was the best martini he ever had. Again - satistfaction.

Finally, there was a very obnoxious Italian/American family in. They ordered their food and, as usual, part way through I asked them how it was. The mother said ""Well! It's not like it is in Italy."" I just looked at her blankly and replied ""Well, we're not IN Italy."" and walked away.

I'm sure you have your own stories and would love to hear other people's stories about food service, customer service - all the funny stuff we went through. I have many more...",3,1745180016.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False
