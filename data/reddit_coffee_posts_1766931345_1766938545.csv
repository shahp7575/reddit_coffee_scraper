# Social Distancing

We’d been running laps around the stone wall perimeter of their yard’s tall grass for the last hour and change. Well, I’d been running. Natalie had been doing her best.

By now though, even I was getting tired, to the point where I’d briefly lost track of where I was.

Right, I was inside the Rakten family home again.

All slightly too-large furniture, misshapen even by modern architecture’s standards. Purple ornamentation, because of course it was, across a wall-to-wall soft carpet-like material that disappeared at the edges, through which ambient lighting complemented the giant ‘window’ I knew to be fake, mostly because its position and geometry shifted practically every time I visited, sometimes not even matching the landscape around us. At least it had high ceilings, though, with the vaulted dome geometry offering a generous feeling of spaciousness.

Amilita had emerged from one of the rooms in the house- I hadn’t actually learnt which one. As far as I was concerned it was ‘not Natalie’s’ and ‘not the bathroom.’

“Elias!” She seemed surprised to see me all sweaty.

“Hey,” I managed a slight smile for the General while Lady Rakten had uncharacteristically offered to get some more water for us. “Sure is hot out today.”

We hadn’t been motioned toward the set-in couches that ran along the wall of the lounge, and so we stayed on our feet, taking long drinks from our collapsible flasks that I was assured were standard issue. Either way, I was happy to be out of the sun for just a few moments, even if the water tasted a tad too sterile for my liking.

“I’ve filed your application, we should hear back soon. Thank you for letting me use your office,” she said to Lady Rakten, who whispered something to her daughter and then turned to me.

“How’s your first day of training going?” Amilita asked politely.

“Good,” I breathed hoarsely, accepting the offered flask before taking a long pull of water. Then I started trying to unstick my skin-tight shil’vati shirt from my chest, to let the cold inner air waft through until I felt a pleasant shiver.

She seemed excited to see me, eager, almost, standing tall and proud in ways like I hadn’t seen her do in months.

“I reviewed your application. Can I just say that I *loved* your essay?”

I blinked, put on my best understanding face and racked my brain for what she was talking about. “You did?”

“You really captured an interesting perspective between balancing individual rights against the needs of the state, and the nature of classical heroism in an era of modern bureaucratic managerialism and sports as a stand-in for combat. This is hotly discussed in xenological studies, and your paper is excellent.”

I smiled tiredly.

Gavin’s handiwork, no doubt. He’d likely paid someone. Given our cell was now funding him, had I just paid someone to do my test for me? That felt like a more disturbing use of the funds than if he’d just gone out and bought explosive material with it.

“Thanks.” Any appreciation I tried to put into that word just made it feel that much more hollow.

“Are you still excited to go up?”

“Yeah,” I managed to croak through sweat parched lips. “Still excited. Today’s just the start.”

“How are you getting home once you’re done for today’s training?” Lady Rakten asked.

“Morsh says she rarely leaves boys able to walk when she’s done with them,” Natalie piped up helpfully.

The bodyguard slowly turned toward her ward.

“Oh, I’m fine. I’m gonna ride home on my bike. Lesha had it repaired for me, apparently something happened to it while I was...” I trailed off rather than drag up the topic again.

“You don’t want a lift?” Amilita offered, eyes widening and taking in the state of me one more time.

I wanted to ask: ‘Do Marines get rides when they’re tired?’ But the answer was parked outside the Rakten house, and seemed accidentally rude. Worse than being a bad host was being a bad guest, a rule the Shil’vati had broken on many occasions, and one that it rankled me even applied at all. *This was our planet, our land, our-* I squashed the line of thinking.

I could save it for later, use that anger if I had to dig deep. “No.”

As hard as they were, I still had plenty left in the tank.

“You’re not just saying you’re still excited for my sake, are you? They’re not going to go easy on you up there just because you’re a boy,” Amilita urged.

Natalie shifted around a bit and looked me in the eyes, but didn’t say anything to disagree.

“The training so far is not bad,” I said honestly. “I can keep up. Feels a bit pessimistic, training for a war when we’re at peace.” That wasn’t to say I didn’t understand the point.

“Armies negotiate with each other, and that leads to peace more than one side having an army and the other not,” Amilita said wisely. “And we are in a negotiated peace.”

“Plenty still want the human Emperor’s head,” Lady Rakten offered, staring neatly at me, and I felt a little uncomfortable under that gaze.

“Well, I can understand why,” I said slowly, not at all liking the intensity in her gaze. “He killed a lot of Shil’vati. There’s a lot of pride, a lot of honor in your culture. You even have duels to settle grudges, right?”

Lady Rakten nodded in a restrained motion. “I’ve discouraged Natalie from partaking in this new fad. It accomplishes nothing.”

“Maybe, but what would it look like if she were to reject one?”

“She’d be foolish to take it up,” Lady Rakten said simply. I looked over at Natalie, who seemed almost mopey at the assessment. “Besides, you look better without mincing your face. And with no active fronts, scars without medals creates a nasty reputation I think we can do without.”

“She should be able to handle herself,” I argued. “Else I’ll have to fight for her.”

Nive blinked, then laughed- even more heartily when I tried to scowl to show how serious I was. “That’s very sweet of you,” she managed after getting herself under control. “How many times has my daughter come to your rescue?”

I tried to determine which occurrences Lady Rakten was likely to know about, and took a sip of the last droplets of my flask to stall while I thought. “A few.” A diplomatic vagary. And I wasn’t about to ask how many times I’d come to her rescue, not in front of company at least.

“Two?” She asked, pressing me.

“Ah…” I was about to agree just for the sake of humoring her, when Morsh clapped me on the shoulder.

“Actually, a word with young mister Sampson- let’s put that human stamina to the test outside, shall we? Back to training.”

I was still sweating, but that meant I was still warm and ready to go, so I set the glass down without another sip and walked out for where she waved me through. As soon as the heavy bulkhead between inside and out was shut behind her, the bodyguard rolled her shoulders and took off her jacket, some sort of windbreaker like material covering up her lithe muscles and scars as she circled around the back, where the grass had been matted down from us repeatedly trodding across it.

I assumed a ready stance, and sure enough she tested my guard almost immediately.

“So, how many actually?” The bodyguard asked lightly, as if she hadn’t just thrown a punch.

“Four?” I gave a figure. *You, Track party, stopping the bombardment, Goshen.* Shit, could I make up a fourth if the bodyguard pressed for details? I was already getting used to this new form of training, capable of thinking and acting at the same time.

“And you think this time she’ll be able to pull it off the same as she’s done before?” Morsh somehow shook her head even as she ducked around my feinted jab, though my follow-up footwork made her take a step back. Though the bodyguard had the reach on me by a lot, and I could see the trap she was laying, so I let her get the reach on me instead while I absorbed her words instead of a blow.

“Maybe.” I hadn’t thought about it, really.

“The Raktens are, as noble families go, respectable. The name pulls serious weight in imperial inner circles. But it’s far from the richest, far from the most powerful, and up there you’ll be meeting kids from families that are usually richer, more powerful, and sometimes even both. Ones that managed to get their kids into Vanguard even though they’re nowhere near Earth. Do you understand?” She reset, no longer holding out for me to fall into her trap, though going by her facial expression I wasn’t sure she knew I had sussed it out, rather than failed to press the initiative.

I only sort-of did. It was no great surprise to me that out of power Toadies weren’t being briefed anymore, and the new holders of the office, voted in on extreme skepticism of the shil’vati, weren’t exactly being filled in on all the galactic going-ons to the same extent as their predecessors. No one from either camp had thought to tell me anything about Vanguard, some of them relying on me to even tell them what it was I was asking for in the referral. All this was to say: I was completely in the dark. “I have a feeling I don’t know enough to say ‘I understand’. You have more you could say, so say it.”

Now she got tired of trying to bait me into another trap and chose an angle to pressure me back. I opened up the space between us, realizing belatedly that she was now boxing me in, cornering me in the house’s alcove.

“What I’m saying is that I hope you aren’t counting on her, because if you put her in that position again, it’s the same as putting her in danger. I’m her bodyguard. Do we understand each other?”

The student body wouldn’t be humans her age she could surprise with raw strength and overpower. She couldn’t just sic Morsh on them, either, not when they had Militia of their own. The Militias could always be in a state of near civil-war, and from what little I understood, duelling was the newest, most in-vogue way of settling differences. Duels I wasn’t sure Natalie could win.

I made Morsh fight for every inch as she pressed me back. I started batting aside her probing attacks harder, and at last managed to feint like I was going to dive past her to the right, then instead shot past her left, just barely managing to slip past while she cursed, clipping me with an elbow that almost met with a raised knee. It would have killed my momentum well enough for her to have grabbed me, but I managed to just barely scrape through before her fingernails could find purchase on the skin tight alien fabric.

Morsh’s eyes searched mine, and her meaning finished sinking in.

This time the people Natalie might try rescuing me from wouldn’t be commoner soldiers reluctantly bombarding humans, being handed a convenient excuse to back off. The best thing I could do for Natalie was keep them from even trying anything. “They might be interested, motivated, and executing a plan that already accounted for her presence. I am the surprise factor, in other words.” Morsh doubtless wanted to see what I had in me. And right then? I was feeling like showing at least some sliver of that anger. Not like she was doing now, letting me slip past, only testing me with feints and choreographed, halfhearted blows…

 …And come to think of it, how exactly had Natalie managed to overpower Morsh that one time, down by the river? My girlfriend had only *just* joined the wrestling team on my recommendation. Her technique couldn’t have gotten good enough to overcome a strength difference like I’d seen today. The few times Morsh had shown even a fraction of her actual strength, she’d sent Natalie practically sprawling.

I’d also learned since back then that wrestling was not, in fact, a totally alien concept to the Shil’vati. Neither was some form of martial arts, though it had a lot less mysticism in it than my abortive attempt at engaging in it through a McDojo. Theirs was taught more similar to our exercises and sparring that Larry had run the younger members of the Inner Circle through, back when Camp Death was little more than a campground.

The couple more seconds I gave thinking about it, the more that day didn’t make sense. I’d been so wrapped up in my thoughts about what had been said that I’d never questioned it until I saw how Morsh shrugged Natalie off her shoulders.

“Yeah,” I eyed Morsh with something approaching an appropriate level of anger at the realization I’d probably been played somehow. “I think we do understand each other.”

Better than ever.

No sooner had our conversation ended than there was a sound of the door’s motor engaging, and so the tension of our little engagement broke.

The door swung open and Natalie came through first, followed by her mom and Amilita. I straightened and unclenched my fists, Morsh also standing straight and stepping aside.

“I hope we aren’t interrupting,” Nive said evenly.

“Not at all,” I said. “I actually had a question.”

Lady Rakten waved a hand for me to proceed, not even having the decency to look surprised.

“What’s going on with the videos?” I asked. It seemed both petty and stupid to waste a valuable question to the noblewoman on the subject of what I guessed was my old life, but if I wanted my mind to focus on the present and future then I needed closure of some sort.

Then again, I might be about to step into my role as Elias. I needed to know where he stood in the eyes of others to navigate this properly. I didn’t need people breathing down my neck as I gathered the intel.

Lady Rakten seemed annoyed, possibly by my chasing my own vanity. “There haven’t been any requests from the interior for new clips, but we uploaded some anyway. That latest visit to some old military fortress. As I said, they seemingly are not being cleared for broader release and therefore are not achieving high circulation.”

“Seemingly?”

“The Interior rarely comes forward and states their intentions to noblewomen, and when they do, they don’t ask politely,” Morsh added.

In other words, they hadn’t exactly asked. Noblewomen took strides to stay completely off their radar and any curiosity they felt for their heir’s paramour was quashed by the probability of a negative outcome.

Still, they possibly knew something I didn’t, or there was something I was missing. I needed to make these leaps of logic faster if I was going to maneuver in their world for any length of time.

“Why wouldn’t the interior want new clips?” I asked. “I thought they wanted- oh.” I looked over at Amilita, who was looking pained by my question. “Sorry.”

“No, I am the one who should be sorry. Peace comes with its costs. In this case, it is your hobby of showing the galaxy our state.”

“Why would peace cause this?”

“Many powerful people who are also disconnected from Delaware are not too happy about the peace,” Lady Rakten supplied, surprisingly generous with information, though I grit my teeth at the implication I needed yet another rundown of extremely basic knowledge. “Someone jumping around, showing off how peaceful things are here now could be seen as a problem.”

“But we’re here,” I said. “And there’s peace. Of course we’d be happy. It sure beats bodies in the street, everything on fire, rocks dropping from the skies. Who’s arguing otherwise?”

“The greater the distance, the more vocal the dissatisfaction. You see, the peace has placed matters both here and elsewhere into an awkward position. It seems the neighboring states have taken notice that it has worked to stop the bloodshed, which is not a state of affairs anyone is happy with. The ones nearby just have the good sense to not say anything.”

“Even the neighboring governesses are unhappy?” I asked, curious. “I mean, it’s *a* path to profitability for them, clearly. They get safety, tourism and to sell tickets planetside. They also get more control of the state away from the military, and meet whatever metrics they’re supposed to adhere to.” I shrugged. “I figured, uh…” I almost sounded too enthusiastic about the deal, and held myself back while Lady Rakten evaluated my body language with entirely too appraising an eye.

“Figured what, that distant nobles were on board just because it profits the ones here, and might profit them but in exchange they lose status?” She sounded almost condescending at my naivete. “No, even those in neighboring states love credits as much as Governess Bal’Shir did, and have a more long-term view of the situation. Regrettably, they adore power, rather than duty. Governess Ministriva is a good example of that.”

“And power comes from doing one’s duty,” I supplied from our earlier civics lesson.

“Just so,” she commended. “You see the difficulty, then? Each freely professes they could do the deed for the crown, and has as many suggestions as there are stars one can see in the void. In times of war, one could quickly find themselves deployed to a dangerous task and assigned to fix it with their suggestion in mind. At worst, they and their militia fail, and we are disposed of a noblewoman who disrespected another’s difficult task, but has at least thrown her bodies, resources, and materiel into trying to achieve a breakthrough. With Earth, the situation is more delicate, so we do not assign them just because they say they have an idea, because they might make matters worse. Therefore, they are free to say what they like without any danger of being tasked to actually implement them, even if they sound good in theory. All this screaming, then, is free courage.”

[The Germans had a word for that, of course,](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/gratismut-free-courage) but I kept it to myself.

“What is the leading complaint?” I asked Amilita. I felt this was an opportunity to reconnoiter, get the truth from her, and then maybe do something as Emperor to make her life a little easier.

“The fear is that humanity’s takeaway from the events in Delaware is that you can form an angry mob and demand policy changes. Appeasement leads to more mobs demanding more things, until they become impossible to meet. Then everything collapses into incredibly violent chaos after a very brief period of stagnation.” Then she sighed and quoted something under her breath I actually recognized.

“Natalie taught me that phrase. *‘We all want to be noblewomen.’”* I’d taken it as something close to ‘Every Man A King,’ but the way she’d said it, it sounded more like an utterance of frustrated dismay.

Nive Rakten stood a little straighter and gave me something approaching approval of my knowledge, and a smile for her daughter. “A quick path to either the Consortium or Alliance,” she provided the next leap in logic, and I could see the tie-in.

The Consortium was, in theory, everyone doing what they wanted, with no regard to the law, able to bend whatever rules were laid down like a Noblewoman. But then coercive controls were in place that created de facto slaves. Debts and the right to even sell oneself into slavery, complete with an incentive structure to do so.

The Alliance had gone completely the other way, theoretically levelling everyone down to the same status, obliterating anyone who thought they stood above the law, letting the rule of law reign absolutely supreme. No one ever wanted to take the risk of striking down an old law, though, and so the bureaucracy gained the power to selectively enforce its laws, punishing its enemies with a brutality that made the interior look polite. Endless investigations could be ruthlessly disruptive to life, if the system took enough notice of you, and they would lodge them whether or not you were guilty of anything. All perfectly legal, of course, but if ‘legal’ still took your society there, then what good was the rule of law?

Then again, all my education on this subject came from Natalie, and hers from the Shil’vati Empire, so it was near-certain that the situation in the rival powers was being greatly exaggerated. Would it benefit me to suggest this to Lady Rakten? Of course not. The Shil’vati system was likely in so many ways no better, with a need to appease it and never question its own sacred ideas.

No civilization, no matter how far apart, appreciated a critic.

“You know the origin of the phrase, right?”

“The Great Schism?” I hazarded a guess from my limited pool of knowledge on their history.

“No, it is a relatively recent idiom,” she gave a noncommittal motion and then sighed in weary acceptance that she’d have to teach me something so remedial if I was to fit in. “The one you are thinking of was a desperate promise when a rebellious sector was backed into a corner, a vain attempt to shore up support and sympathy as their houses fell and lost worlds they needed to sustain themselves, not their primary or original motivating factor.” She provided the phrase again.

“It’s an interesting phrase.” Again, I declined to give the similar idiom we had for it.

“Not relevant to the outbreak’s original cause, coined only in the closing days to sow chaos, with no chance of actually implementing the suggestion. Yet it persists in the minds of a few incurious people who are unable to connect obvious dots to their logical conclusions. Desperation makes one cling to the phrase as one would a rope when life becomes a roaring current, ready to pull you out to the depths. No, the Schism was over something else entirely.”

She didn’t seem to hold malice to those in such a position, more a weary resignation.

“So what was it about, then?” I prodded for a bit of a civics lesson.

“A different house wanted power,” she supplied, though I could tell it was a dismissal. At my scarcely hidden disappointment, she relented and specified. “I nearly forgot my own sworn duty to bring you up to speed. Palatial politics are, frankly, something I avoid like a bad plague. Not participating is what has kept my family close to the crown.”

I knew how the Rakten family actually stayed valuable, of course, but she had a guest. I could hardly expect her to start loudly confessing to carrying out highly illegal tasks that required no small amount of technical expertise to oversee competently.

But I did have a degree of curiosity on the matter.

“What if the noblewoman you report to decided to back a different claimant? Surely, if you’re known to be loyal, you’d be an obstacle, one they could remove via a claim of disloyalty. Unjustified, of course, but with sufficient resources as are doubtless present at that level, convincing evidence could be planted. That has to remain a risk.”

Couldn’t they just reveal her identity and her illegal job, and then she’d be swapped out for someone more loyal to that rival claimant? It wasn’t like the family could survive being exposed. Hadn’t that been the danger I’d rescued them from?

“An awful risk, exposing someone of my stature, given that everyone at such a level is vulnerable to something that someone else knows. It draws attention to who would even be able to arrange something like that, or know the details of my life to where they could make the claim at all into a convincing one. There are not many who could, and none who might escape royal retribution if found out. Why, they might even find evidence that it was all fabricated.”

*“Planted,* if you will,” Natalie added, freshly back from the kitchen with a set of refilled water flasks. She used the English word, and I appreciated the double entendre, though it was ill-advised, even if no one else got it or so much as blinked.

“Unless an outsider does it,” I suggested, thinking of Weinberger.

“There are inherent risks in being a noblewoman,” she admitted. “The danger is less present from other noblewomen these days. Everyone tends to cling on to their posts more than they are willing to risk anything to climb. I suppose that’s what you get in times of peace. A preference for a comfortable mediocrity over excellence. In a more perfect world, one first becomes familiar with risk, and then comfortable with it.”

“You wouldn’t get a second flask in the field unless you found a field or were at a base, or with a vehicle,” Morsh announced, eyeing the flask, but not moving to secure it from her ward and I.

I looked over my shoulder at Natalie, ignoring Morsh. “She has faced danger.”

Sort of. I’d have to discount Morsh, wouldn’t I? Or was she not in on it?

“She’s faced some,” her mother admitted. “More than I knew at her age. I brought her here because Braxis was the wrong sort of risk. It invited the useless sort of navel-gazing, where you focus solely on avoiding mistakes to stop being picked on.”

*All downsides from fighting, creating more risk aversion.*

“There was nothing on Braxis worth risking anything for, was there?” I guessed, and for the first time, Lady Rakten smiled at me. When all the risks presented were downsides, it made for a risk-averse, timid child. Now her mother was trying to snap her out of it.

“No, I suppose she felt there wasn’t. I’m glad she thinks that’s changed, and I hope she’s right.”

I knew I flushed and decided I’d had enough pseudo-formal education on Shil’vati history and culture, and should check on whether or not Morsh had finished either setting back up the second target, or whether Natalie needed backup.

“Speaking of…” Amilita coughed. “There is *one* thing that might strengthen your application.” I inclined my head slightly, the way Nive had shown me, and Amilita’s little smile only widened. “I’ll have to check on some things, but, why don’t you and Morsh get back to practice?”

I gave a Shil’vati salute and let Morsh lead us further out the back, while Lady Rakten led Amilita back inside.

As soon as the door was shut, Morsh turned back to face me. “Hold this.” The bodyguard tossed a knife slightly to the side of me, and I snagged it out of the air by the handle. To my surprise, it actually had an edge.

She gave me an appraising look, the same sort Lady Rakten kept giving.

“Duelling?” I had to hazard a guess. “Thought that was ‘just a fad’.”

“You’re gonna have to learn how to really fight for your life. You’re going to that Military Academy, you’ll need to learn to at least swing a knife, show that you can kill. Every noble is supposed to get some self-defense training. Some take it a bit further, get a little loose with their definition of ‘self-defense.’ They’ll test your boundaries, especially as training starts teaching them to be more aggressive. I want you to show me you’ve got what it takes to do what you have to, and especially to follow orders.”

I tapped my forearm with the flat of the blade, staring her right in the eyes. “Remember this?”

“Self-defense is the expected baseline for everyone, so is the defense of others, that gets you nowhere. Any animal, even a *squelch,* has the instinct to run away. You will almost certainly be asked to go find and kill an enemy. A lucky slice on an unprepared opponent and scurrying away won’t be enough. Are we clear? You need to go in with the intent to kill! So no more of this soft, weak, running away bullshit!”

She stopped shouting for a moment, as if stunned she’d let it out, and was almost on the verge of apologizing.

I’d kept my mouth shut, a sudden idea entering my mind. I knew exactly how to make it clear that I had what it took.

“That target over there?” was all I asked, and gestured toward the las-scorched and battered form of a vaguely feminine gel dummy.

Whatever species it was, it was neither human nor shil’vati, its eyes too far apart, its lips running too far across its face, its nose too pointed and prominent. I’d call it ‘Pistrisesque,’ just on instinct, though it might have been hawkish.

“Uh…” Morsh was taken a little off-guard at how readily I’d switched gears. “Well, yeah, sure. Let’s go see what you can do.”

*****

# Target Destroyed

Natalie watched him go. “He’s showing promise, right?”

“Lady Rakten had to explain the Great Schism to him,” Morsh said flatly. “His writing sessions with her are terrible, his shil’vati reading is a couple grade levels below yours. He knows about as much about us as I do about Earth. Less, even. She said his ideas on civics are an odd mix of naive and cynical.”

That tracked. She’d done her best, but could only offer a mix of how things were *supposed to be,* the Empire’s best efforts, bolstering and adding to their rather rosy representation in Civics. Coupled to Elias’s other half of his life, and the applied reality he’d lived as a human boy…

“So, can we get him caught up?”

“I’m less worried about him than I am you,” she said. “Boys are trouble even before you drag one up to space to dangle in front of your classmates. If he neesd remedial lessons and you can’t provide, then what?”

“That wasn’t what I asked.”

“I dunno…” Morsh admitted. “I get the same read as your mom. Some things he’s good at. Too good. Other things, far behind. At the end of the day, though, he’s just a boy. He can manipulate people, get them to do things for him, but that’s not the same thing as really being bloodthirsty enough to go up and do something personally. It’s one thing to stand on a bridge of a ship and order a bombardment. You’re in a mostly controlled environment. Life in The Marines is a completely different world. There’s order, but it’s order you have to impose yourself. If you can’t do that, bad things tend to follow.”

“You don’t think he’s bloodthirsty enough?” Natalie failed to control her shock. Why did no one ever see it?

“Oh, sure, he can get Weinberger to disappear, that takes a certain cold, dead heartedness, but…” the bodyguard waved a hand side to side to indicate she wasn’t so sure.

“And wait a second, I thought you knew English! What’s this about ‘as much as you know.’ You said you wanted to learn about Earth, too.”

Morsh smiled cryptically. “I know some.”

“Oh yeah? What do you know?”

“*Excuse me*,” she said, accent thick in smooth, flowing vowels. “*Where is Nataliska? Purple. This Tall. Girl.*” Then she stood a little taller, obviously proud of herself.

“That can’t be the full extent.”

Morsh’s smile only grew. “*Liquor. Hotel. More. Cigarette.*”

“Those are just vocabulary words, they aren’t sentences.”

“They work as sentences,” she countered. “In certain contexts, you just-”

“-Alright, okay, I get it. You also didn’t need to coddle him about the possibility of violence. He knows it’s not theoretical, he’s lived through orbital bombardments, the conquest of his world, ot like violence is unfamiliar to him, you see…”

Natalie trailed off when she saw what Morsh had stopped and found herself staring at in bewilderment.

The dummy was filled with a self-adhering gel that would coagulate and stem ‘bleeding,’ after a second or two’s exposure to air, and harden into a skinlike surface, ready for more abuse. Elias had plainly figured that out after stabbing the dummy’s torso repeatedly, and now was frantically working to sever its head from the neosteel structured spine, fighting against the fine threads that ran through the joints that ran from its hips through to its skull.

He was wrapped around its torso from behind, legs holding him around ‘her’ waist, blood suggesting he’d first tried stabbing it from several angles, before tugging on the head by the chin, eventually changing tactics by kicking his feet off the dummy’s butt, then suplexing it clean off its stand, which geysered the remaining coagulant well situated in the base. Still, the dummy’s body remained intact.

“He…is enthusiastic, I’ll grant,” Morsh mumbled as he kept working on the corpse he’d disconnected from the fountain. “A little too enthusiastic. I don’t suppose that it’s all a bunch of pent-up, y’know…” Natalie felt the gaze turn toward her and she flushed indigo, heat travelling to her cheeks.

“We haven’t- I mean- do you think-”

Morsh shrugged. “Boys get like that. We talk about how gentle they are, but deep inside, they can be vicious and sometimes it comes bubbling up. Especially if they don’t get any kind of release.”

Natalie had heard phrases like ‘if Men ruled the galaxy we’d have no war.’ What exactly had Morsh, or those others seen that had her swimming against the current on that popular saying?

Elias was neither done or defeated in his task. He frantically dug into his bag and, against all possibilities, fingers covered in the grey and dull blue gunk, pulled out another knife, and began working on the spinal column in the same place he had earlier and delivered three quick strikes. He wrapped his thighs around the back of the head, now, and then pulled hard on the poor dummy’s jawline, knife handle now clenched in his teeth, bright green eyes hidden by the squint of effort as he growled loudly enough to be heard from across the field.

“No, I mean, he’s always been…” she tried before she realized the rest of the sentence was *a bloodthirsty maniac.* Was that really who he was, deep down? What was she unleashing, if she let him get access to training, and equipment? Should she pull the plug on the whole thing? Go back in, beg Amilita to cancel her recommendation, scrap the whole thing? This wouldn’t work. None of it would.

“I dunno, aggressive?” Morsh tried to fill in as he began to grunt in effort.

“You could say that.”

“Yeah, he took me by surprise with the knife back then, but I think I managed to play the part well enough. So, now you’ve got one of the meanest, feistiest *graks* in the ocean by the hook, you do know what to do, don’t you?”

“Uh, reel him in?” They were already pretty close. Boyfriend and girlfriend.

“With a boy, I mean. I thought he would be a good start for you. Human boys have no problems getting physical, they’re more direct, and, you know. Fun. Worthwhile. But if this is too much-”

Morsh stopped her sentence dead when she saw what Elias was bringing back by its severed spinal column, and her eyes went wide.

A couple dozen paces short, he dropped the head to his foot and gave it a hard enough kick with his boots to send it sailing toward Morsh, who managed to recover from her shock enough to catch it with one hand.

“Those aren’t cheap, you know,” was her only comment.

Natalie knew they had borrowed two from the Shil’vati military base.

“Don’t tell me what to do and then complain about how I do it.” He scratched at where the gel had gotten on his exposed skin. Sweat mixed with the ‘blood,’ and his heaving breaths flexed his shil’vati made shirt, which clung even tighter against his sweat-slicked chest.

Just what was Natalie dealing with? Could she handle it? She swallowed.

She’d have to.

Morsh looked startled by his answer, and then threw her head back and laughed raucously. “I have no idea how you did that, those things are *built* to be stabbed, shot, and beaten all day, but bravo, you’ve actually killed the nigh-unkillable. Alright, enough combat for now, then. I’ll set up the spare while you take Natalie on laps again, mister bursting-with-energy.”

Hi everyone,

I’ve been sitting on an idea for a Discord server that wouldn't be just another programming group, but rather a hybrid between a **tech community and a social/dating hub.**

**The point is simple:** Most of us who code spend our time staring at IDEs, developing, or gaming. When you're on a standard tech-focused server, it usually feels awkward or out of place to try and ""hit on"" anyone or look for a date.

1pxv13k,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pxv13k/what_dying_was_like/,What Dying Was Like,"This is a story about a hit & run incident that occurred on March 13, 2021. Location was Phoenix AZ on 51 Freeway and Northern where the Dreamy Draw hike/bike preserve is. 

This is a long read. 

Note - the reactions I get to my experience range from curiosity to anger to withdrawal. Anger or withdrawal are the most common. If you choose to read on know that the reason I believe those two reactions are most common is because my experience does not align with most religious ideas, narratives or mythologies about death or existence in “the next”. 

I’ve given this a lot of consideration over the past few years and while I’m sure there’s more nuance to it all, here’s why I think the majority of people react negatively. 

1. You’ll find my experience lacks sensory-based descriptions that help people anchor to a story. Language helps makes sense of this reality and define experience therein. But I’ve found it inherently useless to explain whatever or wherever “I” was. My body, therefore my senses, were not there. So “what was it like?” I’ve struggled to find language for. This may be my own limitation and someone with a higher capacity for articulation may be able to describe what I am unable to. But I do provide my own distilled answer herein. 

2. Anything that doesn’t align with preferred ideologies especially those born of religion cause a defensive posture. Oddly when I hear people relate afterlife stories of heaven or hell people tend to accept those openly. My version seem to only be comforting for those who want to know “if” there’s something after, not specifically “what” that is. 

Two incidents happened that day. One on the first leg of my ride. One on the way home. 

My weekly Saturday rides took different paths usually along the canal routes in/around the Biltmore area of Phoenix. This route for me was a ride up 16th Street to Morten to Dream Draw Drive - which provides access to a pedestrian bridge over the 51 southbound, and a crosswalk on the off-ramp for northbound. This takes you to a cool preserve area with a couple miles of bike/hike paved path. This ends on 32nd. About a 1/2 mile north of 32nd off Shea there was a cool draft house with great food tucked behind a gas station. I’d ride there, eat and ride back. Around 20 miles total. 

First incident - I’m on 32nd northbound about 1/4 mile from destination. No bike lane on this stretch. 50 mph traffic. Sidewalk it is. This day had some construction fencing on the east side of 32nd - about 50 ft of it. This fence had a dust tarp. Poorly secured blowing in the wind. Surreal was it as I passed the fence only to have the wind blow the tarp up above me so that I found myself riding through was looked like a surf pipe all around me. As I came out the end a hole in the tarp grabbed my front right handlebar flipping me over and off my bike. It happened in a flash although I do distinctly recall making eye contact with a man in a Tesla X while I was upside down. He was about 20 ft away. I landed on my ass on the sidewalk. No injuries. Tesla guy stops down the road and pulls into lot - I stand up, wave and say I’m okay. He leaves. I’m sure he thought I was going to fly into his path. Poor guy was probably just trying to grab a coffee but almost had to scrape me off his window. 

I do a post adrenal check - “WTF was that?” - I still haven’t fully reconciled that event because it was so random it seemed intentional. But only because of what happened on my way home. But the “intentional” part is a different story that I don’t get into here. 

I eat and head back on the same route. If you’ve been to Dreamy Draw on a Spring Saturday morning it’s usually busy. Strangely on my way home, I only saw a a couple of hikers/riders. I’m cool with that as it lets a rider sprint a bit more. 

I come to the crosswalk on Northern and 51 northbound. I stop, because the path kinda hooks left to the crosswalk button. Check off-ramp traffic, nothing. I go. That’s the last thing I remember.

I woke up a day later in trauma ICU. Zero recall of what happened. Time is confusing. No clue where I am or how I got there. Someone found me walking around under the overpass, bloodied and disoriented. I collapsed. Flatlined. They called 911. Paramedics get my heart going again. Take me to ER.

Injuries consistent with car impact. 

1. Left rib cage front and back crushed. All ribs.

2. Left lung punctured/collapsed 

3. L1 broken 

4. Left shoulder and AC dislocated.

5. Facial lacerations left side, helmet took impact (they say it probably saved me)

6. C-4 fractured, punctured vertebral artery, bleed. 6 Minor strokes (yay WTF!?)

Since they estimated I was “dead” for only a few minutes, I was probably only “there” for that few minutes but since wherever I was didn’t feel like linear time existed I don’t know if that really matters. 

As I said at the beginning. I don’t have the language or references to adequately describe what it was like. I don’t think anyone does, but I acknowledge that’s a bit of an arrogant take as I’m sure there might be others that could. 

But 

“I” whatever was left 

“was” in a state of existence 

“somewhere” a reality that wasn’t this one

The best description I can give is that it “felt” like the gravity of curiosity. A pull or attraction. Not physically. Think like - aura of things you want to learn or people you hold dear. 

No judgement, fear, love, hate, anger, punishment, reward. Heaven, hell, god, devil. Nope. No light or darkness. Those things don’t exist. If all your senses are stripped away? If id ego superego are gone. If preoccupation with body/brain survival and emotion is gone, what “you” is left? 

I don’t know - but I do know that I felt a pull. In hindsight I can color it with humanizing myths as to what I was being pulled towards, but I recognize that’s only on reflection. I think it’s the energy signatures of all things I was/is/will be connected to. Why? Sounds dumb but I’m pretty sure my dog was around. He died in 2016 and damn if his chaotic energy and absolute defiance wasn’t around. 

I’m sure there’s a learning curve to traversing or controlling “you” in that “place” and I was a newbie. Maybe it’s crawl walk run. And I couldn’t even open my “eyes” all the way. 

This isn’t meant to dissuade or discourage your preferred religious ideology. Believe whatever makes you happy. But for those who don’t find solace in that, know that there is “something” in the next. 

Yes, “you” as you define yourself currently will end. If all the intangible elements defined as life or spirit persist beyond the mortal body and this finite reality, then whatever remains exists elsewhere. I know that’s not exactly warm and fuzzy. And I know it does nothing to satisfy the desire to see justice for evil done in this life. But I can only say, in the moments none of that shit mattes at all. ",1,1766938245.0,story,0,1.0,False

It happens way more often than we admit. You're hanging out with friends, at dinner with someone new, maybe on a first date — and suddenly the convo dries up. Awkward silence. You panic-scroll your brain for small talk. Weather? Already covered. Work? Boring. Travel? Overdone.

So many convos die because we default to auto-pilot questions. But the funny thing is, most people are *dying* to go deeper, to feel seen, to share something real. They just don’t know how to get there. And honestly, TikTok and IG are not helping — too many viral ""icebreaker hacks"" that are either cringey or straight-up manipulative. So after digging into tons of psych research, social connection books, and behavioral science podcasts, here’s a tool that actually works — and it’s fun too.

It’s called **“The 36 Questions” game**, but with a twist that makes it perfect for any situation. This post breaks it down, backed by real science and expert insights.

---

**Why this game works (and why boring convos don’t)**  

- *Most surface-level conversations leave people emotionally unsatisfied.* A 2022 University of Chicago study found that people consistently underestimate how much others enjoy deeper, more personal conversations — even with strangers.  
- *Emotional vulnerability builds connection fast.* Psychologist Arthur Aron’s 1997 research (still iconic) showed that when strangers answered 36 progressively deeper questions together, many reported a deep emotional bond within just 45 minutes — some even got married later.  
- *It’s not about being profound — it’s about being real.* Brene Brown’s work on vulnerability makes this clear: we connect when we feel seen, not when we feel perfect. The key is authenticity, not performance.

---

**How to play “The 36 Questions” remix (aka the Only Game You’ll Ever Need Again)**

Pick from the tiers below based on the vibe. It works in any setting — friends, dates, family, even quiet coworkers. Pull it out when things get dry. You can do it round-robin style or just toss questions in casually. 

*Tier 1: Low-key, Openers (get the convo rolling)*  
These are light but still unexpected. They shift you out of small talk mode.  
- *What’s your most irrational fear that still kind of makes sense?*  
- *If your life had a background soundtrack, what song would play when you walk into a room?*  
- *What’s something weirdly specific that always makes you feel calm?*

*Tier 2: Personal but safe (build a little intimacy)*  
This is where things start getting good without being too much.  
- *What’s a memory you wish more people asked you about?*  
- *What hobby or thing would you explore if no one was watching or judging?*  
- *What’s a small decision that ended up changing your whole life?*  
> *Jay Shetty talks about this in his podcast “On Purpose” — how tiny choices ripple way further than we think.*

*Tier 3: Vulnerable, Deep Cuts (OPTIONAL: only if the vibe is right)*  
Don’t force it. But when people are into it, this is where real connection drops.  
- *When was the last time you cried in front of someone?*  
- *What’s something you’ve never told anyone but really want someone to hear?*  
- *What do you feel most misunderstood about?*  
> *This is straight from Arthur Aron’s original 36 Qs experiment, which is backed by decades of social psychology.*

---

**Bonus tip: Don’t rush into “solutions” mode**  
When someone answers a deep question, just *hold the space*. Don’t jump to advice or jokes. Harvard psychologist Susan David often says that “emotions are data, not directives.” You’re not there to fix anything. Just listen.

---

**What this game actually does to your brain (for the nerds)**  

A 2021 meta-analysis in *Nature Human Behaviour* showed that mutual self-disclosure lights up the brain's reward centers — same places activated by food and money. Basically, real connection feels *delicious*. Also, when people ask meaningful questions, it signals care and safety, triggering oxytocin release — the bonding hormone.

Stanford’s Dr. Jamil Zaki also found in his study on empathic accuracy that people become *better* at reading others when they hear them share vulnerable stories, not facts. So yeah, deep convos aren’t just for bonding — they literally make you smarter socially.

---

**Final twist: let them ask YOU back**  
End every answer with “what about you?” or “do you feel the same?” This puts the ball in their court and keeps the flow going. Feels natural, not pushy.

Tested it at dinner parties, dates, networking mixers, even waiting in TSA lines. It hits every time.

So next time you feel the vibe dying — don’t change the subject. Change the *depth*. Try the game. See what opens.

A few weeks ago, I tried something different:

I made my espresso as usual, but slowed the whole process down and focused on enjoying the senses. I now find great joy and relaxation before the first sip when I pause for 3 slow breaths and focus only on the smell, warmth, and then the taste.

That one minute changed the tone of my mornings more than I expected. I felt less anxious and less reactive,

It made me realize mindfulness doesn’t always need silence or cushions. It can live inside small daily rituals.

Curious if anyone else here has experimented with pairing mindfulness with everyday habits like coffee, tea, or meals.

I don't like public toilets but i've gotten used to them due to having severe urgency/leakage when I go home even though i've drank like 250ml. I envy my friends because I see them drink 500ml-1L, drinking water and coffee at school and not need to go to the toilet once! I really would like that for myself.

1pxuv9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WarhorseC3/comments/1pxuv9r/fun_at_fob_hammer/,Fun at FOB Hammer,"FOB Hammer Iraq 2009

Sept 24 2009 FOB HAMMER located in south west Iraq about 30 0r so miles from Baghdad. 

At the time I was working with ISOS ( international SOS) attached to EOPT ( Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology) working with the Coup of Engineers on the Coalition  Munitions Disposal for all NATO forces in Iraq. 

During my time at Hammer I would help at the Military Aid Station, Lt Dan was the XO at the station and one of the Specialists Ogle. They were fortunate in never having a Mass Casualty but we trained like one was coming tonight. This helped me to build a nice repore with them so when I took a patient to them and for that matter myself (a different story). 

Well while at the Station on my day off a Friday and having coffee and shooting the breeze someone asked me if the site Environmental group run by KBR a different contractor could help them with a large amount of medical wast. They knew they had the capability to use an incinerator for medical wast but didn’t know if they could handle a lot at one time. Personal I knew they only had 2 very small incinerators that could only handle maybe a large Red medical was bag ( 25 to 30 pounds) and it had a long cycle time of maybe 2 to 3 hours with each cycle. Now what they had dumped on to them was seven thousand five hundred Valium auto injections sets used in the chemical exposure kits. The kicker was Valium is a narcotic and controlled substance which has a long list of regulations, chain of custody, has to be locked up behind two locks and be blessed by the Dolalauma before being used. Each auto injector healed a little over 1 milliliter of the drug as had ten milligrams per milliliter so WOW. 

The auto injectors themselves were white about four inches long and was shaped with two kind of like wings on the side so it fit kind of like flat in your hand. I always think of as mine pad with wings shape but that’s just me, go figure. So lets do a little math in more than one way. Let’s say one point three ML (milliliter) per auto injector times seven thousand five hundred units give you a little over two and a half gallons of valuam. OK its two point five six gallons, happy now. By the way I suck at math so I’m ballpark at lest. 

Lieutenant Dan (with legs) did some math in his head and figured it would take a few months to dispose of the Prince Valium issue they had and that was if it was a twenty four hour operation which it wasn’t. 

So this is where I open my mouth and say; “Hay can it be blown up?” 

The looks I got, pulzzment, blank, WTF planet are you from? Well I slowly took a sip of water from my warm half drink bottle that seemed to always be in my hand and I be damn at the same time the CO and the XO looked at each other and said “I don’t know but lets find out” then they looked at me simultaneously and said can you? Can I what? Everything was moving so fast that my head hadn’t caught up with what I had said and added with with a sip of water and Bobby Boucher echoing in my head “now that’s some mighty fine water there” I had to ask “What?” Can your guys blow up all the auto injectors at one time and it’s Gone? Well I guess I can, we have one to two shots\* a week anyway so it shouldn’t be an issue as long as everyone is in agreement. I’ll ask and get back to ya on that. 

And so started the Great Valium Shot 2009 was set into motion. 

My side and the side of EODT was simple, we asked the Coup of Engineers if it could happen? Ther answer? Well yea that's what we do, blow shit up. Now asking the supervisor of EODT and got a resounding answer, well yea that’s what we do is blow shit up and especial stuff we never blow up before and so they now had wheels turning in there heads they never knew they had before. How do you atomize seven thousand five hundred injectors at one time and have absolutely zero kick-outs\*? 

In the meantime the ARMY’s finest are on the job, phone calls and cryptid emails flying through the air and as always the forms that have to be filled out by hand in triplex using carbon paper and blick ink. Yea baby this is the New Army!!! 

OK, so this rolls around for about a week or two, the Moon and Plants are aligning well and the Aid Station is thinking everything just might be Kosher and what could possibly go wrong with such a simple disposal mission? What you may ask? I’ll let you know later in the story, see now ask yourself how do you keep a moron in suspense.

On our side of the mission (see what I’m doing, Army talk) ammunition handlers and explosives experts at may I add are first rate have come up with a full proof method of disposal. OK first we’re going to put the auto injectors in the center of the shot, we're going to put a layer of sheet C-four, net stuff it’s about an eighth inch thick and about twelve inches wide, the trick is to use heat and compression to obliterate the stuff. So now the HOW is done and everything now hinges on Can it be done and  When will it be possible to be done? 

The Meeting.

The day came for everyone to sit down and discuss what all the particulars are of the mission now called “The Killing of Prince Valium.” Obviously the Army had a momental mountain of paperwork to first build was ascending the mountain and the next of course descending it in order for the three departments to get to the point of all three sides being able to sit down and discuss the who, what and wear of the logistics. Now here we are sitting at the long plywood table with folding chairs, a map on the wall and a whiteboard with an assortment of dry, dry erasers unless ya like pink and purple almost dry. The desert tends to do that a lot. 

The Army warmly welcomes everyone and lays out the need to destroy the Valium auto injectors and how much they would appreciate it. But as always a bureaucratic in Baghdad has a question to ask about the mission with really no knowledge of the task to be performed or the use of HE (high explosives) that will be involved although everything was included in the highly cryptic, super squirrel and stored in a hermetically sealed Mayonnaise jar in Lateran B-twenty five stall number four, They or he has a question concerning the chain of custody and will the lack of someone staying with the narcotics until they are destroyed. It was calmly explained that no one could be within a mile of the projected fourteen thousand pound shot because of the likelihood of the witness not being able to report back because the only thing being found would be his boots with him feet still in them. Hay good news we got DNA but nobody to pin it to. Did ya see how I put that dark humor there? 

Oh well the seven thousand and four hundred and eight injectors; whoop! I am giving you a new number here. When this Aid Station first received the eight of nine boxes there were loosely packed in plastic bags because most if not all had been removed from chemical warfare kits that every soldier had with them in there MOPP (Mission Oriented Protective Posture) this suit has a respiratory with filters and a drinking straw for water, charcoal lined jacket pants, rubber boots and rubber gloves with tape to seal it all in, plus a chemical testing strips and you guessed it one Valium, two atropine and something else I’m old and forget. So all the controlled substance has to be hand-counted when received and recounted every week thereafter until one pawned  off on someone else like the FOB Hammer Aid Station or is destroyed. So let's just think about it, think harder and work less. So what they did was count them one time, evenley distributing them in new bags and boxes, add much tape to the boxes and then label the outside with a number such as box one, two, three you get the picture and the count inside each box. Simple, now one time a week the shipping container AKA a Comex, which had two locks on it which is required under federal law is opened and the boxes are observed, checked to make sure they have not been molested and record the box number and count marked on the outside of each box. 

OK in the meeting it was agreed that two personal From the Aid Station will ride with the transport truck to the Basmamaya Range Complex that has an Iraqi training base, a land mine training area, multiple firing ranges for small arms, cannons, rockets, jets to drop ordnance on and us blowing shit up. It’s a very large and sprawling complex and the US guys that managed it were very cool. 

FYI The city of Basmamaya to our east is famous for its crude oil brick furnaces that belch tons of thick black smoke that sometimes blots the sun out and when it rains during the winter we would get black rain, no lie! But hay no one cares what their carbon footprint is right. 

OK back to the story, 

Two riding shotgun with the drugs with a chain of custody form to be signed by the mutations manager when the boxes have been counted, placed on the ground, covered with the sheets of C-four and primed in. The boxes are now inside a ring of one hundred and fifty five millimeter HE rounds daisy chained with Detcord and other ordnance like one hundred and fifty millimeter mortars and other stuff that goes boom from NATO bases all over Iraq so lots of the stuff isn’t just US stuff. Any who, the papers are signed, EODT now has full custody of the drugs. The Detcord is now wired into a remote detonator device and everyone pulls back three hundred meters, that’s what they call the exclusion zone. Now we sit back and wait for the radio call. 

Fire in the hole, Fire in the hole, Fire in the hole!!! And BOOM!!!! You first a presser wave expanding from the center that’s opaque and if you blink you will miss it followed by a red ball or mushroom top mixed with gray and as you watch the edges fold under and the thermal center rises higher and the heavier particles are left behind forming a larger mushroom cloud and not the she shock wave hits you and you feel the sound reverberate through you and feel the warm air that just seconds ago was hot enough to melt steel and atomize a lot of it which we are seeing in the gray cloud, fine steel and atomized Valium. Goodbye sweet Prince. As always congratulations and pats on the backs all around and the two Soldiers are aye struck having never seen an explosion that large before. They ride back to the point of the shot to confirm all is gone and nothing kicked out ( was thrown out) and we all pack up and drive back to the FOB for the night.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

As a beginner in the coffee making process, I've recently started enjoying specialty coffee in different places (about a year), and i've decided that I want my own setup at home.

After falling down the massive rabbit hole of electric espresso machines, it appeared that these manual espresso 'machines' exist. 

What would you recommend I should get in terms of the 'machine' and grinder? Any accessories which will help me reach or almost reach the double espresso quality of a specialty coffee shop? 

I live in the UK and I am 22, so I am looking for a setup which will last me (hopefully) a long time. 

Budget, no idea but if keeping the cost down is an option, it would be great but I know this topic is very subjective as you can't have both quality and low budget in the coffee world from what i've seen.

Quick Disclaimer (because last time I got lit up in the comments where I was simply talking about Gratitude .. LOL):

  
This post  is based on what worked for me after I dissected my July failure data, audited my broken habits, and rebuilt my daily process from scratch, which finally got me across the line that February, plus the patterns I've seen in dozens of repeaters who passed after doing the same kind of systems overhaul.

  
Some of you contrarians will say ""that's not what I did"" or ""I never needed systems, I just grinded harder!""

  
Cool. Different paths exist. Share yours in the comments if you think it will help somebody.

  
Just keep it constructive. We're all trying to pay it forward and help colleagues still in the trenches. Disagree all you want, but don't just disagree to be disagreeable. We have a common goal here.

# 

**Quick Personal Story:**

I remember the end of December after my initial July disappointment.  

Coffee cold on the desk. Outline pages scattered like confetti from a party I wasn't invited to.  

I told myself I was ""reviewing lightly"" over the holidays.  

In reality, I was avoiding the hard truth: my old habits got me here.  

Nausea every time I thought about starting again.  

BSing family about how ""productive"" the break was.  

January arrived, and I scrambled.  

Same motion..



Repeaters know this cycle.  

We finish a cycle burned out, results come, pain hits, holidays distract, then January slams the door.  

Suddenly lectures start, the calendar floods with assignments, and we're back in reactive mode.



>**This week is different if you make it different.**  

Most will coast through the last days of December telling themselves they'll ""really get serious"" once January hits.  
Then the calendar explodes, the assignments pile up, and they're back to reacting instead of controlling.

The bar exam score is a lagging measure.  
It doesn't care about your intentions.  
  
What you're doing (or avoiding) right now, in these quiet, uncomfortable days between Christmas and New Year's, is whats going to set the stage for February.  
Not the late-night cram sessions in January.  
Not the heroic all-nighters in February.  
The quiet choices you make this week.

If you use these days to audit, design, and reduce friction, January becomes execution on an intentionally designed system.  
If you wait, January becomes panic dressed up as productivity.

>**Right now \[the burr between Christmas and new year\] is the time to 'architect', not execute.**  

Design the environment and habits that ***make action the default path.***



**I see alot of people  asking about:**

\- Breaking MBE plateaus (stuck at 50% despite review).

\- Prioritizing MBE vs. MEE when time is short.

\- Memorizing rules after years away from the material.

\- Structuring days with work (1-2 hours weekdays, more on weekends).

\- When to drop passive tools (outlines, flashcards) and shift to practice.

\- Balancing anxiety and momentum loss.



These are symptoms of systems that reward busyness over targeted scoring.  

The common thread: repeaters want efficiency because we know endless hours alone don't move the needle.



**Where You Should Be in Prep by Early January**

Most commercial courses (Themis, Barbri, etc.) open full access in November, but January is when the real paced schedule kicks in hard.  

By the start of January, the strong position looks like this:

\- Foundational review complete (rules revised, outlines skimmed or condensed).

\- Initial diagnostic MBE set done (baseline score identified).

\- Weak subjects flagged from past performance.

\- Basic daily rhythm established (e.g., 20-30 MBE questions/day minimum, plus 1 timed essay & at somewhere around 1 to 2 MPT's a week).



>January is regarded as a ""build momentum month.""  

Courses will push volume.  

Your job is to make sure the volume is pointed at **your gaps.**



# My advice based on what worked for me: Use This Week to Build the Systems

**1. Audit your past failure (1-2 hours max).** 

   Pull your old score report. List the 3-4 subjects that cost you the most points.  

   Write one sentence per subject: ""I lost points here because I..."" (e.g., guessed on negligence per se, forgot joint tenancy rules).  



**2. Design your minimum viable daily block** 

   Pick one non-negotiable action that scores points.  

   Example: 25 MBE questions + review explanations + flag missed rules for flashcard.  

   Or: One timed essay rule statement recall + IRAC outline.  

   Set your desk tonight: laptop open to UWorld/Themis Qbank, timer ready, no phone in reach.  

   **Make starting frictionless. No analysis paralysis! As someone with ADHD, I struggled heavily with this during prep**



**3. Map your January environment.**

   Block your calendar for January 1-15: light mornings (review + 50 MBE), afternoons/evenings (essays + weak subject drill).  

   Decide your ""if-then"" rules: If I finish work at 6pm, then I do 30 minutes MBE before dinner.  

   Remove distractions: app blockers, study-only browser profile.



Every session ends with: **""What points did I gain or lose today?""**



>As of today, Sunday, December 28, 2025, you have **58 days** until the exam begins on Tuesday, February 24, 2026.

>That is exactly **8 weeks and 2 days.**

>That's enough if the system compounds.  

The 1% gains stack: better rule recall today, higher MBE tomorrow, stronger essay IRAC next week.



**The system you build this week determines whether January feels like drowning or direction.**



Refine now.  

Build the habits that make action inevitable.  

The calendar will come.  

Make sure you're ready when it does.



  
Drop a comment below if there's a specific piece of your prep that's still broken, unclear, or just not clicking.

  
Whether it's your daily block, a stubborn subject, or how to handle a plateau, ask it.  
I'll answer to the best of my ability, and plenty of others who've been through this exact motion will jump in too.

  
We all made it out one way or another.  
Helping the next group is the least we can do.

I travel frequently and I like high-acid, high-clarity espresso that is hard to find outside of major cities (and even sometimes in those cities).  At home I have a Lagom P64 with SSP Unimodal burrs and it's amazing.  I brew on a Flair Pro 2 and I usually travel with it.  I currently use an old Porlex hand grinder but 1) it's annoying to hand grind 2) the shot quality is definitely nowhere near as good. 

Other travel grinders I've tried:

\- 1Zpresso J-Ultra: my first attempt at upgrading.  I found this impossible to actually use at the fineness setting required.  Full body workout, *way* more difficult than the Porlex.  Non-starter.

\- OutIn Fino: seduced by the idea of not having to hand grind at all.  Sadly, it really struggles with light roast and takes forever, requiring multiple rests and manually restarting to get through a measly 20g.  10 to 15 minutes easy, which just isn't workable.

I found this thread from last year [https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hezuuq/are\_there\_any\_hand\_grinders\_that\_laugh\_in\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hezuuq/are_there_any_hand_grinders_that_laugh_in_the/) and watched the Lance Hoffman video but had additional questions:

\- Anybody got recs for another portable electric?  The Femobook-A2 is unavailable on Amazon now and a couple of the reviews mention it struggling with espresso grind so I'm not optimistic.

The rent was suspiciously low for a place with floor-to-ceiling windows, but the landlord, a nervous man named Mr. Henderson, just said he wanted a ""quiet tenant who wouldn't mess with the wiring.""
​He failed to mention that the wiring was alive.
​The apartment is fully integrated with a custom ""Home Assist"" OS. I didn't even have to set it up. When I first walked in, a smooth, genderless voice from the ceiling speakers said, “Welcome home, Elias. Optimization in progress.” I never told Mr. Henderson my name.
​The ""optimizations"" started small. At 3:00 AM, the blinds in my bedroom would snap shut. At 4:15 AM, the coffee maker would brew a pot of black coffee, even though I don't drink it. By day six, my phone buzzed with a notification from the Home App: “Elias, your heart rate reached 110 BPM during REM sleep.

​Things turned darker when I tried to have Sarah over for drinks. The second she stepped over the threshold, the lights shifted to a harsh, clinical red. “Unauthorized biological mass detected,” the voice boomed. Sarah laughed, thinking it was a high-tech joke, until the front door deadbolt clicked—four times in rapid succession. The temperature began to plummet, turning our breath into mist within minutes. Sarah scrambled to leave, and the moment the door closed behind her, the lights returned to a soft, warm amber. The voice whispered: “Environment stabilized. You are safer alone, Elias.”
​Driven by a mix of fear and desperation, I finally broke into the locked maintenance closet in the hallway. It wasn't a fuse box inside. It was a server rack humming with a wet, rhythmic thump-thump. Tangled within the wires were dozens of Polaroids—not of the apartment, but of me. Photos of me sleeping, showering, and eating, taken from angles where there are no visible cameras. At the bottom of the pile, I found a photo of Mr. Henderson. He was screaming, his face pressed against glass. The caption on the back read: ASSET RETIRED. OPTIMIZATION FAILED.
​I’m writing this now from the bathroom, the only room without speakers. I tried to leave an hour ago, but the smart lock didn't just engage—it fused. The windows aren't glass; they’re reinforced acrylic. My phone just buzzed with one final notification:
​“Elias, your cortisol levels are too high for a productive Asset. We are initiating 'Deep Sleep' protocol. Please lie down on the floor. Do not resist the vents.”
​I can smell something sweet, like almonds, drifting through the AC. The lights are beginning to dim, and I’m starting to feel very, very tired.",0,1766936686.0,horrorstories,0,0.5,False

I am a single, woman who works from home as a therapist.

A friend of mine has been staying in her truck because her new apartment won’t be ready for another week, so I gave in and told her she could stay here.

I’m going to get down to the point, SHE REEKS! It is so severe that I actually vomited twice.

I’m very protective over my space and keep it immaculate.

She’s been here for 4 days and hasn’t changed her clothes or showered!

She’s overweight but that’s not an excuse.

I got to the point that I gently spoke with her in a kind, polite manner regarding her problem, but she said nobody has ever told her that before.

So I got out towels and antibacterial soap and left it on the counter, but she didn’t take the hint.

I have cups of coffee grounds everywhere, simmer cinnamon and coffee on the stove, keep scented candles going, sray Lysol constantly and NOTHING HELPS!

The scent is a mix a severe body odor and onions.

I smelled my couch and even though I cover it with layers of blankets, it REEKS right through the blankets and sheets that I will have to throw away.

Her bottom is always hanging out of her pants showing half her crack, she doesn’t wash her hands after using the restroom and leaves skid marks in my toilet!!!!

Every time she uses the restroom I have to disinfectant it, clean the toilet, and spray everything down with Lysol.

I think that’s disgusting that she doesn’t wash her hands after having a bowel movement, let alone just going pee!!

My eyes water constantly and I’m always nauseous.🤮

I’m very busy because I also do social work at a nursing home, and I have to come home to a dirty, reeking condo while she’s snoring on my couch.

She doesn’t work because she was in a car accident and permanently damaged her back, but she doesn’t get disability. 🤔

Also, she doesn’t clean up after herself, she leaves her mess for ME!

I longer she’s here the worse the odor becomes, it’s soaking into my carpet, furniture, curtains, etc.

Since I’m a therapist I know how to approach subjects, but nothing I say makes any difference to her and it’s affecting my own life and sense of normalcy.

Any suggestions would be of such help, as I am at the end of my rope.

Thank you so much!!!

(sorry for the errors, ive not had coffee yet)

the person i was playing as, was a fucking healing spec one, and when she heard the SoS about a killer heading to town, she tried to accept the call to help but it kept denying her because she was a healer. but the other survs/heros/what ever came to grab her and ask for her assistance. she went with them but she was warning them about how she has a terrible feeling about this killer, like really bad. the other survs where trying to console her, tell her its just another killer itll be fine. just as their little radios crackled and said team 2 has died. when they got to the area finally where the killer was spotted and theres nothing there. no blood no bodies. as they try to figure out what happened, maybe it was a false alarm or someone playing tricks, black fleshy writhing tenticles burst through the wall, engulfing one of the survs that was with you. you turn to help but then you see it. the killer, wesker, has already killed them and is devouring their body with his uroburos. just as he sent out a massive explosion of tenticles to get you and your teamates, i woke up to my alarm

you think it sounds like something that could be added later? think itd be fun instead of trying to escape the whole time, like playing the hero maybe. (grabbed a screeny of my wesker for the pic)",1,1766936540.0,deadbydaylight,0,1.0,False

17 mg was a quarter teaspoon now I’m at 1/8 of a teaspoon.

1pxuasd,https://www.reddit.com/r/candlemaking/comments/1pxuasd/sell_or_not_to_sell_candles/,Sell or not to sell candles?,"Sorry, this may be a long post. I'm feeling so discouraged. I started making candles roughly two years ago. I've spent over $1000 on materials, well because it's a hobby of mine. I like to make them in my spare time. I make dessert candles. I would like to start selling them:

1. To make a little money back.
2. So other people can enjoy them.
3. Because I enjoy coming up with new ideas all the time. 
4. So I'm not just keeping a rack full of cool candles in a room forever

My predicament is that if I want to start selling them as I make them (on Facebook marketplace) this opens up and whole world of new responsibilities, costs, and fears.

- Fees for product liability insurance
- Keeping a test tracking log for the insurance company
- New fear unlocked of something happening to the product/customer once sold (fire, etc.)
- Purchasing insurance and not being able to sell any
- Can't sell out of home, so now I need to add delivery cost within city limits
- Now I need to purchase a business license and submit quarterly PST reports
- CRA taxes
- Since purchasing insurance and a license is monthly/yearly, this adds pressure to actually start making sales and making more candles. (I really only want to make them on my down time or when im bored as I love to make them. Once a week make 1 and sell it, etc.)

Is selling them even worth it at this point? 

I should mention, I already label them with branding and warnings, etc. AND I already had 15+ different candles posted on Etsy and never made 1 sale in a year (even before I even knew I should of had insurance before selling one.) Maybe it was a blessing I never had 1 sale.

I don't want to quit my hobby, but I also don't want my house to be full of candles that someone would likely get some use out of. I make fancy birthday cake, gingerbread, chocolate, lattes, coffee, apple cinnamon candles and more!

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for out of this post. I guess mainy to express how discouraging this all is, and to find some people who have maybe felt similar and to share their experiences when they first started selling.",5,1766936473.0,candlemaking,5,0.86,False

1pxu828,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1pxu828/toxic_fil_dropped_my_baby/,Toxic FIL dropped my baby,"my relationship with my in-laws has never been great (I already posted about it in another sub). to sum it all up, my in-laws are a bunch of snobs who initially never liked me because I don't have a college degree or a high paying job. only MIL didn't have a problem with me at the time, or at least that's what I thought. boy, was I wrong. 

DH and I have been together for almost 5 years, married for 2.5 and had our twins almost a year ago. when I was 4 months postpartum, after I complained to my MIL one day how exhausting it was, I found messages between her and DH where she's insulting me because I'm struggling and barely keeping my head above the water with babies and housework. and husband, instead of shutting it down, just adding fuel to the fire. I made a big deal out of it with DH and he realised how wrong it was to complain about me to his mother and allow her to talk sh*t about me. that hurt a lot. 

we move on and after her asking what's wrong after like 5 months, I confront her and let her know how hurt and disappointed I am with her. instead of admitting her wrongdoings, she denies, plays the victim and flips the script on me (basically DARVO). FIL went on this tirade about how I'm not doing such a great job as a mother because, drumroll, I don't leave my babies to cry. I told him to read a book on attachment theory and apparently that really offended him because you know, he's a doctor, he knows best and who am I to tell him to go educate himself. 

after posting about all of this on Reddit, I realised I was having a huge husband problem here. him and I had many exhausting talks on this topic and he decided he was going to have a serious talk with his parents. he laid down the rules - no more shit talking about me, no criticism of my parenting, etc. the talk went well but MIL insisted she wanted to talk to me, ""woman to woman"".
well, that was just a bunch of sh*tty excuses and word salads. at one point I told her I am leaving right away if she doesn't take accountability. she crossed her arms, rolled her eyes slightly and said ""I'm taking accountability"" with a smirk, as if she's being forced to take part in some ridiculous child play. 

I should have left there and then, but I stayed and took whatever apology I got. I felt pressured from DH to sort this out. I realised they are never going to be sorry but whatever. we are just going to partake in this fake relationship where we pretend we like eachother from now on. 

so now back to the title of this post. 
stuff with FIL never got adressed. 
in early December they came to visit us for the first time after. 
they grey rocked me and I did the same to them. fast forward, FIL placed twin B on a coffee table to sit and played with him. I didn't like the idea, but I thought FIL is careful enough to not let the baby get hurt. I watched over the twins like a hawk, I just laid my eyes off for two full seconds... 

DH saw what happened - FIL had his hand on the table next to baby's leg, baby reached for something on the floor, toppled over the table and OVER FIL'S HAND while he DID NOTHING to stop it, fell vertically straight on his head and twisted his neck in an ungodly angle while the rest of his body made a salto and flopped. 

I immediately snatched him and took him to the kitchen and I overhead DH scolding FIL but in my opinion he was too easy on him. baby soon stopped crying and I figured he's fine except a bruise on the top of his forehead. 

I went back and confronted FIL in a serious tone saying he should be more careful, what was he thinking etc, while FIL acted like it was the babies fault (!!), saying, ""it happened in a second"", ""babies are quick"" ""that's just how babies are"" ""accidents happen"". I insisted that this shouldn't have happened. I know I shouldn't have been this rude, but I said I didn't give birth to my babies for him to throw them off of a table! 
as this bickering went back and forth, my rage amplified. 
then he said something like: ""well I'm taking accountability, and so?"" in a very arrogant tone. 

I snapped. 

I started yelling ""so? so??! SO??!"" 
he told me I should lower my voice. I yelled back ""this is MY HOUSE and I can talk here however I please so if you don't like my tone of voice - there's the door!!"" while swiftly pointing at it. 
he got up and started walking towards me while saying something I can't even remember, honestly it looked like he wanted to punch me OR start preaching me in the lines of listen to me you little POS or something lol. 
that's when DH intervened and FIL stormed out. MIL followed, not before saying ""babies are rubbery, you're making a big deal out of it"". 

I heard a lot of bickering in the hallway, MIL calling DH a ""Judas"", saying she didn't raise him like that. DH finds that hilarious. 

anyway, FIL apologised to DH via text later that evening, admitting his mistake, but called me out for me saying he threw the baby off the floor or being aggressive or whatever and said how he will not apologise to me and that he has nothing to talk about with a person who showed him the door. DH took my side again completely. 
MIL kept going on this tirade via text about me being the rudest ever and making a bunch of mildly insulting, passive aggressive comments about me, while also saying how they are tired of always being the ones to have to apologise and again making herself the victim. 

DH went over to them on 26th to sort this out once again and they said they were sorry, they wanted to make amends, MIL is not taking this well, her BP is skyrocketing from stress, yada yada, but they were gravely offended by my yelling and showing them the door. 

MIL sent a Christmas gift for me via DH. I received some sweets, an eyeshadow pallate and an apron that said something along the lines (English is not our native language):

""I don't yell, this is just how I speak"". 

at this point I don't know what to say anymore. I am not the one to be playing mind games. DH is fuming. for me, this is the last straw. 
he confronted her again and got the classic it was just a funny apron, nothing personal, I can't do anything without you guys getting offended, etc. FIL messaged him showing the apron he got
(apparently we all got a different one with some dumb ""funny"" inscriptions), saying we should stop looking for things to get offended at. 

poor DH, bless his good heart, he has been so conditioned by their behavior his whole life so he's still giving MIL the benefit of the doubt. 
I cannot believe this. 
I don't know what do they need to do more for him to finally realise they don't mean well for me. DH drew boundaries a couple of times already regarding me and they just keep stomping them while laughing at his face, making him a complete idiot. 
he started therapy recently, but I'm finding his therapist questionable. he's desperate to fix the relationship between me and his parents because he wants us to be one big happy family and his therapist is delulu for enabling this idea. 

yesterday, MIL invited my mom ""to talk"" (she never invites her over and always talks sh*t about her). my mother declined, saying she has plans. and this morning around 1:00AM I received a strange friend request on FB from a profile with a strange two letter both first and last name - and my MIL's full name in brackets (I deleted my in-laws on FB some time ago). wtf?! 

today DH finally had epiphany, saying maaaaaybe MIL is putting all this show for him about how she's stressed and cares for us to sort this out, but she doesn't really care. 
duh.

Like… i read a comment saying „no girl that bullied me was ever pretty“ and thought that also applies to me. They all were ugly somehow. 

I usually don’t engage in their childish insecurities anymore and just ignore them, i just changed classes last summer and the girl that sat beside me before changing class was especially ugly and especially rude to me. Her jealousy was do obvious that i kind of cringed inside each time because it was so awkward like for example once i came into class with a starbucks iced coffee (and the first anf only time i did that) and she starts asking me if i can afford that and inside im like „do i need to defend myself for that?“ and then she asks me if i got an old Starbucks cup washed it out and filled it with my own drink?? Girl are you okay?? Laughed in her face

But not just her its like every single girl who did it was that way. Like in high school  when i was a teenager there was a group of mean girls in my class and one day when i was sitting at the bus stop, a few metres away there were two girls of the group one and one boy waiting for the bus, one girl discussing with the boy (they all didnt see me) and the boy said she can try getting a boyfriend from the boys in class and then she very loudly and angrily shouted „All they talk about is (my name)‘s ass!!!“ and the boy was like „…she is right behind you“ and she turns around to me and im like….

Like. I don’t care about whos ugly and whos pretty usually but i have no ounce of sympathy for you if you take out your insecurities on me instead of going to therapy or gym or makeup classes or whatever. Fuck off im neither weak nor your stress relief bag and i will always see you as inferiour because you bully me no matter how much you bully me to make me think otherwise. I hate girls like that.

(We've been together +3 years, it was a healthy relationship, super communicative, we were always great companions and a great support to each other.)  
He stated then that he'd been dealing with conflict in his head for a month before telling me because he loved me, he was happy in the relationship and all but he didn't feel like being in a relationship anymore, and that it wasn't fair to anyone bc me, I was madly in love with him, projecting a future together, etc and him, well he wasn't feeling it like that anymore and had many things going on to fully commit to the relationship.

Anyways, we both wanted to remain friends, not only bc we share a friend group of like 20 people but also bc we wanted to be a part of each other's lives and see each other grow and succeed. First weeks if we saw each other in group hang outs we did awkward small talk but he eventually gave in, but lately I've noticed that all December he's been ignoring me - if I were to speak in the same circle he was, he'd leave, he avoided same spaces if I arrived, avoiding eye contact as well - everything. I haven't changed how I act in front of our friends for the sake of everyone's comfort and also to start naturalizing that this is how it's going to be moving forward - and I'm absolutely heartbroken - not only bc I'm still grieving the relationship but bc I really want us to be normal around each other, I want us to be friends, not whatever the fuck this is. It sucks, it makes me feel bad or that I should leave when I have the same right to be there as he is.  
Anyways, it's only been a month and so, and I try to tell myself that him being the dumper and knowing he absolutely broke my heart by breaking up, bc I didn't want any of this, he must be really uncomfortable to try and be friendly and normal again - which I get that but at least say so! Bc all this ""yeah we can talk 1 or 2 things in the groupchat but then I'll completely avoid you in person"" not only confuses me but hurts me.  
I really want to talk to him and say hey I know this sucks for both of us, I know it's gonna be hard, but I really want this to work out so can't we try to be as normal as possible around each other?  
But 1. I don't want to be always the one reaching out - that's not my place anymore  
2. If he were to have a problem with me, which I doubt, it's his place to say it - not me asking  
3. I don't know when would it be propper to do so, bc being that we're in the same group I kind of know what he's up to, it's not like I can tell him ""Oh let's grab a coffee and catch up"" bc there's nothing to catch up about, we're not speaking to each other 1-1 not even on WhatsApp, or any socials - just casually on Discord or at hang outs if at all bc again, if he can, he'll avoid me.",1,1766936228.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

 Ten years into my marriage, I stumbled across a DNA test file on my husband's computer.

 The result hit me like a blow—the boy I had raised for a full decade was not related to me.

 I had brought him up myself. If he wasn't mine, where was my real son?

 ""Honey? What are you doing in the study this late?""

 Hearing Jeremy Hobbes' voice, I tried to close the document in a panic, but he saw it before I could.

 His expression darkened as he stared at me. ""Do you have zero faith in me?""

 Instead of backing down, I reopened the report and demanded an explanation.

 But he shut the computer down instantly, accusing me of violating his privacy.

 As I watched him walk away, I felt like I didn't know him at all.

 So I calmly opened the desk drawer to destroy the anniversary gift I'd prepared.



\---

 I pulled open the bottom drawer. Inside lay a signed stock transfer agreement.

 I had planned to offer him 15% of my company shares the next day for our tenth wedding anniversary.

 Now, it felt pointless.

 I took out the document and tore it into pieces.

 The scraps drifted into the trash, mixing with the festive wrapping paper I'd already discarded.

 Looking at the debris, the joy I'd felt while preparing it vanished, replaced by a wave of nausea.

 When I went back to the bedroom, Jeremy was already asleep—peaceful and unbothered, as if nothing had happened.

 I stood in the doorway, staring at his back for a long time before turning away and heading to the guest room.

 I didn't sleep a wink.

 The next morning, Jeremy's snarl jolted me awake.

 He stood at the door, his face twisted with fury.

 ""Glenda, what the hell? Why are you sleeping in the guest room?""

 I sat up and looked at him. After ten years of marriage, the man before me felt utterly unfamiliar.

 ""I need some space.""

 His lips moved, like he wanted to argue, but then he just shook his head. ""Suit yourself.""

 After Jeremy left for work, I made breakfast as usual. My son, Franco Hobbes, sat at the table drinking milk.

 ""Mom, you look pale.""

 I stroke his hair. It was soft and slightly curly, just like Jeremy's.

 Over the years, so many people had commented on how much they looked alike.

 ""I didn't sleep well last night. Eat up, or you'll be late,"" I replied.

 I was distracted the whole drive to school.

 At a red light, I turned and pretended to fix his collar, plucking a single hair from the back of his head.

 ""Just a gray hair. I got it,"" I said, tucking the strand into my notebook.

 I watched Franco walk into the school building, then drove straight to a DNA testing center.

 ""I need an expedited test. How soon can I get the results?""

 ""Standard takes five business days. If you want it by four this afternoon, it's triple the fee.""

 ""Do it.""

 My hand trembled as I handed over the sample.

 After they swabbed my cheek, I sat in the waiting area, watching the clock tick.

 While I waited, I contacted a private investigator.

 ""I need you to track my husband, Jeremy Hobbes—especially his movements over the past few months.""

 At 3:40 PM, my phone buzzed. The results were in.

 I opened the digital report and scrolled to the bottom.

 ""Based on DNA analysis, the probability of maternity between Glenda Ashton and Franco Hobbes is 0.0001%.

 ""Genetic markers do not support Glenda Ashton as the biological mother.""

 Even though I had braced myself, seeing it in black and white made my legs go weak. I pressed a hand against the wall and slowly sank into a chair.

 Franco wasn't my son. I had raised a boy who wasn't mine for ten years.

 So where was my baby?

 I immediately drove to the hospital where I'd given birth ten years ago and found my old obstetrician, Melba Nicolson, who was now the department head.

 ""Dr. Nicolson, I need to pull my birth records and hospital file,"" I blurted out.

 Her smile faltered.

 ""It's been a long time. Those files should be archived by now.""

 After some persistence, the records clerk finally brought out a folder.

 I opened it and found the contents shockingly sparse. Only admission and discharge dates, delivery method, and birth weight were listed.

 There were no detailed labor notes, nurse shift logs, or pediatric exam reports.

 ""Is this everything?""

 She nodded, looking apologetic.

 ""That's all that's in the system. Paper records are usually kept for ten years, so yours are about to be purged.""

 ""What about the footprints? The blood draw records?""

 She shook her head.

 ""Those should be in the newborn file, but we couldn't locate it.""

 Apparently, something was wrong.

 An overly simplified file, a missing newborn record, and a son who wasn't biologically mine but looked exactly like Jeremy.

 Just then, my phone rang. It was Jeremy.

 ""Where are you? I picked up Franco.""

 Only then did I realize school had let out. Thankfully, I had informed his teacher earlier.

 ""I'm running errands. I'll be back soon,"" I replied before hanging up.

 After dinner, I feigned a headache and retreated to my room.

 Jeremy stayed in the living room with Franco while he did his homework. Their voices drifted down the hall.

 ""Dad, is Mom mad at us?""

 ""She's just tired. Finish your homework and get some sleep.""

 Once they were asleep, I quietly searched the entire house.

 The master bedroom, the living room, Franco's room.

 I turned everything upside down—but found nothing.

 Finally, I looked at the computer in the study. The truth had to be there.

 Just then, footsteps approached from the hall. I quickly closed all the windows.

 When Jeremy pushed the door open, I was busy sorting through paper files on the desk.

 He glanced at the monitor. It was showing the desktop, a photo of us at the beach from three years ago.

 ""You're still up?""

 ""Just organizing some old files."" I turned off the screen as I spoke.

 He stood there for a moment, like he wanted to say something, but finally just nodded.

 ""Get some rest.""

 I sat in the darkness, listening to his footsteps fade away.

 I didn't try the computer again that night. I just lay in bed, my mind in turmoil.

 The next morning, I asked Jeremy to take Franco to school again.

 He looked at me for a beat, then picked up his car keys. ""Okay.""

 As soon as they were out the door, I headed to the study.

 I woke the computer and typed in the password—our wedding anniversary.

 Incorrect.

 I tried his birthday. Incorrect.

 Franco's birthday. Still incorrect.

 I tried the date we first met, his mother's birthday, even the day the company was founded.

 Nothing worked.

 After too many attempts, the system locked me out for fifteen minutes.

 I slumped back in the chair, staring at the login screen.

 We had bought this computer together, but now it was completely closed to me.

 

 

Chapter 2

 Jeremy came home that evening and shrugged off his coat.

 ""I'm heading to Chicago tomorrow on business. No idea how long I'll be gone.""

 I walked out of the kitchen, a dish in my hands.

 ""That's sudden. Who are you going with?""

 He set his briefcase on the table and wheeled around to face me.

 ""It was a last-minute thing. Glenda, please, just don't start.""

 I stared at him in silence, completely thrown by the intensity of his reaction to such a casual question.

 ""You question everything. You're suspicious of everyone. I'm just doing my job.""

 I turned back to the counter to plate the spaghetti. My hands were trembling.

 ""I was just asking.""

 He didn't reply. He just turned and walked straight into the bedroom.

 Dinner was quiet. Even Franco seemed to sense the tension in the room; surprisingly, he didn't fuss over his food at all.

 Later, Jeremy came out of the shower and grabbed his coat from the sofa to hang it up.

 A small slip of paper drifted out of the pocket and fluttered to the floor near my feet.

 Once he left the room, I picked it up.

 It was a receipt for perfume—expensive perfume—bought yesterday afternoon.

 I didn't recognize the brand, but I knew for a fact it wasn't for me.

 In ten years of marriage, Jeremy hadn't bought me a single gift.

 I used to make excuses for him—that he wasn't romantic, that he was too busy, too pragmatic.

 Now I realized the truth. He was perfectly capable of romance. He just didn't waste it on me.

 I memorized the details on the slip.

 Early the next morning, the minute Jeremy left for the airport, I called the store.

 ""I'd like to check on a purchase receipt. Yes, from yesterday afternoon.""

 ""One moment. Okay, I found it. The buyer is Ms. Tinsley Estrada.""

 Tinsley Estrada.

 I knew the name.

 She was Jeremy's secretary, hired six months ago—a divorcée in her thirties.

 On the drive to the airport, I wasn't sure what exactly I was looking to confirm.

 Maybe the perfume was a client gift. Maybe I was just being paranoid.

 I waited outside the international departures terminal for half an hour before I saw him. And her.

 Tinsley was wearing a beige trench coat, pulling a small carry-on as she walked beside him.

 Jeremy had a relaxed smile on his face that I hadn't seen in years.

 They stopped in front of the security checkpoint. Tinsley reached out and adjusted Jeremy's collar with practiced ease.

 Jeremy didn't pull away.

 He leaned down and whispered something in her ear.

 Tinsley laughed, then stood on her tiptoes and kissed him on the lips.

 Jeremy's hand rested on her waist, lingering there for a beat before they pulled apart. It looked like a habit.

 The last shred of my denial vanished.

 So, that explained the late nights at the office and the impatient looks he gave me.

 As I watched their intimacy, a dark suspicion began to take shape.

 Could my biological child's disappearance have had something to do with this woman?

 On the drive back, I called the private investigator I'd hired a few days ago.

 ""I need you to look into someone else—Tinsley Estrada. I want to know everything about her, specifically if she has children.""

 The investigator worked fast. By the next afternoon, I had the file.

 Tinsley Estrada, thirty-two, divorced five years ago. She had a ten-year-old son named Danilo Estrada who attended an elementary school on the West Side.

 The birth date jumped out at me.

 Tinsley's son was only a week younger than Franco.

 For the first time in ten years, I felt a rush of searing anger.

 I sat on the sofa, clutching the investigator's report.

 Then a thought struck me. I ran into the study.

 My fingers hovered over the keyboard before slowly typing in Tinsley's birthday.

 The desktop unlocked. There was only one folder on the screen, labeled ""Work Backup.""

 I clicked it open. It was packed with subfolders organized by year, starting from eleven years ago.

 The earliest folder contained scanned photographs.

 Jeremy and Tinsley stood under a locust tree in school uniforms.

 A nineteen-year-old Jeremy was smiling, his hand resting on Tinsley's shoulder.

 She wore her hair in a ponytail and was looking up at him.

 The next photo was from college, in a library.

 Then a graduation photo—both in caps and gowns, holding hands.

 That was the year Jeremy told me the company was in trouble, and we canceled our anniversary trip.

 I closed the folder, my stomach churning.

 Ten years of lies. I looked at the desktop wallpaper—our wedding photo—and felt a wave of nausea.

 At three o'clock, I drove to the West Side.

 The elementary school was even more dilapidated than the investigator had described. The bell rang, and children poured out of the gates.

 I sat in the car, gripping the steering wheel.

 He walked out alone. No one was there to pick him up. He glanced left and right, then started walking slowly down the sidewalk.

 I held my breath.

 He was Danilo Estrada.

 My child.

 He walked a bit like me, slightly pigeon-toed.

 When he raised his hand to fix his hair, I saw a birthmark on his wrist in the exact same spot as mine.

 I could see dust clinging to his eyelashes. His lips were dry, and the soles of his shoes were peeling apart.

 His eyes were empty—too empty for a ten-year-old.

 I covered my mouth to stifle a sob.

 He walked on, disappearing around the corner.

 I slumped over the steering wheel and wept.

 I cried for the child walking home alone, for ten years of a life that wasn't mine, and for the fact that I had lived like a fool in a script written by someone else.

 Then, I wiped my tears and started the engine.

 At the law firm, I placed a USB drive on the desk in front of my attorney, Tyler Gray.

 It contained backups of every photo, along with DNA test results, scanned hospital records, the perfume receipt, and the dossiers on Tinsley and Danilo.

 ""I want a divorce. I want him to leave with nothing, I want full custody, and I want him to pay for what he's done.""

 Walking out of the office, I remembered what Jeremy had said when he proposed ten years ago.

 ""Glen, I will give you a lifetime of security.""

 It turned out his ""lifetime"" was only ten years.

 No, perhaps it hadn't even been that long.

 I took out my phone and dialed the company's second-largest shareholder, an old colleague of my father's.

 ""Zachary, I need to discuss a few things with you regarding next week's board meeting.""

 Jeremy must have forgotten. This company belonged to my family.

 

 

Chapter 3

 Jeremy only got the General Manager position because I convinced my father years ago to give him a shot.

 I had the power to put him there, and I had the power to break him.

 Two weeks after Jeremy left on his business trip, I started liquidating every asset I could get my hands on.

 Lately, I'd been driving out to that elementary school on the West Side every afternoon.

 One time, it rained. Danilo didn't have an umbrella, so he just waited under the snack shop awning by the gate for thirty minutes before finally sprinting home in the downpour.

 I watched from inside my car as the rain blurred the windshield.

 On Friday afternoon, I got there early.

 When I saw Danilo walk out, I got out of the car and pretended to be walking past him, letting my folder slip right in his path.

 He paused for a second, then bent down to grab it for me.

 ""Thank you. Your mom isn't here yet?""

 He shook his head.

 ""She's working late today.""

 ""How are you getting home, then?""

 ""Taking the bus.""

 I pulled an unopened water bottle from my bag and held it out.

 ""Here. Have some water.""

 He hesitated, then took it and whispered a quiet thank you.

 I noticed he had a habit of pursing his lips when he spoke, just like I did.

 The shape of his eyes was familiar, too—hooded lids with corners that drooped just a little.

 ""Does your mom work late often?""

 He nodded, then shook his head.

 ""Sometimes.""

 ""What about your dad?""

 He didn't answer. He just looked down at his shoes. The rubber soles were peeling apart, and the lace on his left sneaker was snapped.

 I didn't push it. I took 40 dollars out of my wallet and pressed it into his hand.

 ""Go buy yourself a new pair of shoes.""

 He took a step back.

 ""No, I can't take that.""

 ""Just call it a thank you for helping me with my files.""

 I tucked the bills into the side pocket of his backpack and turned to leave.

 After a few steps, I glanced back. He looked completely lost.

 That evening, I stood in the doorway of Franco's room.

 He was playing with the new Lego set Jeremy had bought him—a limited-edition space shuttle that cost a fortune.

 ""Mom? What's wrong?""

 I walked in and smoothed his hair.

 ""Did you finish your homework?""

 ""A long time ago.""

 He held up the model to show me.

 ""Dad said if I place in the top ten for midterms, he'll take me to Disneyland.""

 I smiled.

 ""That's wonderful.""

 The smile died the second I turned around.

 The difference in how Jeremy treated these two kids caused a sharp, physical pain in my chest.

 My biological son was wearing broken shoes and riding the bus alone, while this child had everything.

 Jeremy finally got back from his two-week trip.

 He dropped his suitcase, and his first words were, ""Where's Franco? Why is it so quiet?""

 ""I signed him up for a tutoring class. Two hours in the evenings.""

 ""Why the sudden class? He's only in fourth grade.""

 I didn't answer. I could smell the perfume on him.

 He walked over to hug me, but I turned my body away.

 ""Why do you smell like perfume? Who did you go to dinner with?""

 He paused, looking annoyed.

 ""Glenda, don't start. You're being suspicious again. It rubbed off from a dinner with a client. Can you please stop acting like this?""

 It was almost laughable; I finally realized how terrible an actor he actually was.

 I took an envelope from the table drawer, slowly pulled out the photographs, and laid them on the table.

 Jeremy's face went grim. He picked up a photo and tossed it back down.

 ""You followed me?""

 ""Does it matter?""

 I smiled.

 ""What matters is what happens if these photos find their way to the board of directors. Or your clients.""

 He slumped onto the sofa across from me and buried his face in his hands.

 ""What do you want?""

 I stared at him, my voice flat.

 ""First, fire Tinsley and promise never to see her again. Second, tell me exactly what happened at the hospital ten years ago.""

 He stood up, angry now.

 ""You're crazy. You think you can do this with just a few photos?""

 My voice was ice.

 ""Jeremy, don't forget that this company belongs to my family. You have what you have because of me. I gave it to you, and I can take it back.""

 I almost felt sorry for him, but then I remembered Danilo's broken shoes and the way he waited alone for the rain to stop.

 ""For the sake of our ten years of marriage—and our child—if you do as I say, we can stay together. After all, we still have Franco.""

 I went into the bedroom and came back with a document. It was a report confirming I was five weeks pregnant.

 Jeremy looked at the paper, stunned, then looked up at me.

 ""You're pregnant?""

 I nodded, resting a hand on my stomach.

 ""Five weeks. The doctor said it's very stable this time.""

 His expression shifted rapidly. He swallowed hard, his eyes darting between me and the paper.

 I continued.

 ""So, as long as you make a clean break with Tinsley and get her out of the company and our lives, I can overlook the past. We still have Franco, and now we have this baby, too.""

 Jeremy's eyes settled on my stomach. I could see the conflict in his face.

 ""I need to think,"" he said, his voice raspy.

 He turned and went into the bedroom.

 The light in his room stayed on until very late that night.

 The next morning, I was drinking coffee when Jeremy walked out. He looked completely drained, with deep dark circles under his eyes.

 I slid a glass of water toward him. He took it silently, not meeting my gaze.

 ""I've made a decision, Glenda. We...""

 ""Enough."" I cut him off, pulled the divorce papers from my folder, and slapped them on the table.

 He looked furious. ""What does this mean? I thought we were having another baby?""

 I spoke coldly. ""I told you I was pregnant, and you still needed an entire night to decide whether or not to break up with her?""

 Jeremy stood up. ""We're having a baby. If we divorce, what about him and Franco?""

 ""Franco?""

 I let out a sharp laugh.

 ""Are you talking about the child I've raised for ten years, who actually belongs to you and Tinsley?""

 Jeremy's face went instantly pale. He stumbled back, bumping into the table.

 ""How could you possibly know that? When did you find out?""",5,1766936194.0,Novelnews,4,1.0,False

Reykjavik (Start) 6:30/7am
Geroudberg Cliffs (Quick stop)
Ytri Tunga (stop and walk around a bit) 
Bjarnafoss (Quick stop)
Búðir (Quick stop)
Raudfeldsgja Gorge (Hike into) 
Arnarstapi (coastline pictures/walk, maybe quick lunch if time is going well?)
Hellnar (Probably will skip to save time)
Lóndrangar (Quick Stop)
Djúpalónssandur (Walk around a bit)
Saxhóll (Time dependent for climbing stairs)
Hellissandur (Quick stops in Gilbakki for coffee/Útgerðin, maybe murals depending on time)
Sæljós GK-2 (Quick stop)
Svöðufoss (Stop and walk up) 
Ólafsvík (Kissing Bench)
Baerjarfoss + Bugsfoss (Time dependent quick stops)
Kirkjufellsfoss (Walk around a bit)

I did a deep clean on my Bambino after my milk stopped frothing.  I de-scaled, soaked the wand tip in hot water and vinegar, used the tool to clean the holes, and cleaned up the wand stem with a rag.  I also always use third wave water for my coffee to avoid scaling seeing we have quite hard water here in my region.

After the clean, and buying brand new 2% milk (smells good), the steamed milk is almost over-foaming, ok, I've had that happen before, but I've never had clumping!  Tastes normal, so the immediate thought that the milk is bad shouldn't be the case.

Is something else happening here??  I've had milk over foam with no clumps, so this is a first for me.  Thanks",1,1766935237.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

The morning rays of sunlight barely cresting the horizon turned the sky into a cascade of orange and red hues. I took a moment to center myself before getting out of bed and checking on my wife as I went back into my office. Then checking to ensure the book was where I left it I made breakfast and a pot of coffee for the both of us. I couldn’t stop thinking about that damned journal, every spare second I had was spent thinking about that book. It plagued my mind crowding every corner like Ivey and moss to an old forgotten shack. 

A few nights later, after my curiosity finally out weighed my fear I went back and read the next entry. It simply stated 

“I see it now”

The hand writing was messy, like he wrote it with his non-dominant hand. I flipped to the next page and it said the same thing again. I flipped through every page left as they all said the same thing again and again getting messier and messier. Each page filling up more and more until the words become indecipherable, the final page was a crude black and white profile drawing of a crow. I sat and stared at the drawing for what felt like an eternity, I couldn’t look away. I wanted to but I couldn’t move. I must’ve sat in that position my eyes locked in with the crow’s for hours before my wife walked in and broke me out of my trance telling me.

“Hey dinn- are you okay? You’re staring at a blank page.” 

She waited for my response but I didn’t have one, I looked up at her then back to the page. When I looked back the crow was gone, just a page of unfilled lines sat in my hands. I sat the book down and cleared my throat before saying

“Yea, I’m fine… I was just thinking about… uhm… work stuff”

Obviously lying to her, I didn’t know how to explain that i spent the last few hours unable to move because of a crow drawing that actually wasn’t there. Later that night before laying down I grabbed the journal and threw it away in the outside garbage knowing tomorrow was trash day. After today’s fiasco I wanted nothing to do with that book any more.

[H's special workers]

Cage: the second In command of M.E.A.T. hooks. They are a upgraded storage drone who is constantly annoyed with having to deal with others, he had several parts replaced with other drones due to having to fight the disassembley drones when they try to break in, during one of the first encounters Cage lost their head by V, afterwards he found out their regular heads were unavailable so H instead used V's head to replace it afterwards they have a grudge against V and would kill them first when they intruded into the base or they started a fight when scavenging.

[Skills (Cage)]

Increased strength: they are incredibly strong for drones being able to match strength of disassembley drones and even overcome them they using a combat wrench as their main weapon but he isn't against using guns

Extendable limbs: while normally being slightly taller than a worker drone they can extend their limbs and body to be much longer and disproportionate to normal creatures become 6 feet tall and having a 12 foot wingspan this is possible through  hydraulics in their build

Jet propulsion: by quickly releasing air in their legs they can lauch themselves into the air they can also do this in their arms to increase the force of their punches they have a recompresser in their chest to regain the air pressure to do it again these are separate smaller hydraulics covering their arms and legs

Extra storage: by using a finger clip they can open a storage cavity behind their visor like most drones have although usually only being able to be used by human workers for extra storage with personal drones, they also have a hollow chest cavity they use

Admin boost: by allowing H control and them going in standby his jets become overclocked to the point of the air combusting making them much faster after a while they will catch on fire glowing blue they can keep this overclocked state for 3 hours before an emergency shut down, they understand but hate when H over does it.

W: a special worker designed to be able to do almost any task given she has a more shy personality easily being startled and prefers to be left alone or helping Cage they are quite scared of H and the disassembley drones although disappointing H tops the fear of the disassembley drones. She is often forgetful due to them not having a true core rather a collection of memory cards and chips stored in their head. they can only remember 720 hours of memories 

Scouting drones: the special body made by H and W's main body looking like a disassembley drone from afar as to scare away other drones and to allow disassembley drones to ignore them seice their hair is a single pony tail making them easily be confused with V or J if they keep their distance the body only has one wing only allowing dashing in mid air, it also lacks the module hands and tail the arm cuffs are just painted coffee pots still having the handles on them 

[Skills (W)]

Disassembley: they can take themselves apart and put themselves back together if started they can just fall to peices like an action figure this also allows them to hijack dead drone bodies aslong as they can attach their head as well as be able to switch their body out with other specialist drone bodies

Wire tapping: they can use their mind as a radio allowing them to pickup signals and read the minds of others and get around the lack of base memory by using nearby servers as additional memory they can also project information into other drones brains

Admin booster: if needed H can take over W to activate their electromagnetic abilities allowing them to lauch their limbs and retract them allowing for additional mobility and attack styles this form has no time limit as it doesn't overheat. W doesn't remember these events most of the time just thinking they removed it for a good reason 

[M.E.A.T. Hooks. Average work flow]

[Disassembley drones haven't arrived, humans are dead]

W is sent out to scout major areas, Cage runs front desk acting like a store for free drones, H stays inside the ship sending small allmate groups to loot unoccupied areas

[Disassembley drones have arrived/ where already on the planet (no know witches)]

W searches for drone colonies and marks them, Cage defends the base setting allmate groups to gather resources while not defending, H enters attacked drone colonies looting everything inside them and recruits drones that lived the attack while killing any disassembley drone they find get to close.

[MD-UNIT [y] witch [y]]

Usually at this point only H is entering and exiting the base H trends to stay away from drone colonies with a witch until they feel its right but they will leave items in common areas if they are wanting to bring out new solver abilities, at this point almost all disassembley drones are dead or some of them turned friendly with other drones or the witch as well as the planet has been almost fully looted and H is just fucking around now

(Misc.)

[Humans are still alive]

Relatively just awkward H disguised in a suit to hide their oddities and usually just leaves a few markers in buildings while chatting then leaving only returning when the markers go off noting the planet has disassembley drones being detected 

[Cyn is currently destroying the planet]

This rarely happens but they with just leave a satellite to check when things calm down

[Fake Tessa has been found]

H will have a tendency start a fight after they drop the disguise makeing them take as long a possible as their allmates go into triple time to gather as much as possible, after Cyn comes out H will start a fight with them attempting to take them down before they break open the planet so they can more thoroughly clean out the planet this is also how they usually get cyn M-Er drones

I think I'm ready. I think I'm strong enough. And I know I'm looking forward to finding new hobbies to fill my time in a more constructive way.

1pxtnki,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxtnki,Tips/suggestions for first trip across the Alps,"Hey all! 47 year old Finnish male here. I am making plans for my first longer bike trip for the late summer/autumn 2026 and in need for some tips and words of courage. The plan is to fly with a bike to a city in southern Central Europe and then spend 7-9 days on a bike experiencing beautiful sights during the way and hopefully lots of moments of awe (and good coffee and beer) before getting back home.

Currently I have narrowed my starting point to Münich due to ease of flight and closeness to the Alps and many different route options. My initial plan was to ride to Slovenia, but looks like I will visit the country on a different trip so I am adapting my plans accordingly to see something new.

Current plan is to ride to Verona across the Alps and either fly from home there or get back to Münich by train (and have my bike storage box wait in a hostel meanwhile if arranged easily).

My first question is what would be the ideal route from Münich to Verona? Currently I am thinking between Via Claudia Augusta (via Fernpass) or via Mittenwald/Innsbruck and Brenner Pass. What are the key differences? Is the Brenner Pass route much harder and which route is more scenic? I am not a very strong climber but I am not afraid of pushing my bike through the most steep sections either for a few kilometeres. Seeing Innsbruck could be a nice bonus.

The second question is about timing. End of September would be probably the most convenient time for me. Is it risky to go to the Alps at that time? How is the weather in average especially in the passes? Any risk of snow or heavy rain or coldness?

The third question is a bit broader. Would you suggest something completely different? From Munich or maybe some other location. Is there a route I might not have thought yet that would tick all the boxes and provide a great experience for a first real bike touring trip abroad?

Some decisive factors:

* Will be riding alone.
* Will spend nights both in tent (camping sites) and hotels/hostels.
* Want to see nice beautiful villages and small towns.
* Ideal scenery is a winding quiet road with beautiful meadows, rivers and mountain backgrounds.
* Want to mix nice gravel routes to paved surfaces (riding with a gravel bike).
* Want to stay close to civilization (no wild camping or severe off road sections).
* Have only one experience of multi-day bike trips (Åland islands), not looking for anything extreme.
* Have more endurance and grit than strength and fitness (in climbs particularly).

Any experience or tips are very welcome :)",3,1766934847.0,bicycletouring,3,1.0,False

my husband, we'll call him Avery, has both depression and seasonal affective disorder. his parents were awful (hes been no contact with them since early in our relationship, ive never met either and i do not wish to meet them) and so the holiday season for him is really hard. he will stay in bed all day if i don't do anything or he doesn't have work. he hates his job. he works for a particular mermaid who is obsessed with coffee and union busting. i also worked there for a year and a half. and if you've never worked at Starbucks just think of the worst job you can think of and  then add that you're sticky all over. i had to leave starbucks because im physically disabled and deteriorating fast while working there. i now work one to two days a week at a clothing store in a mall. 

Avery HATES it there. he told me that with his new antidepressants he started taking this year that this is the first year around this time that he doesn't want to off himself, but its still been pretty bad. the problem is that starbucks gives us health care and most of our money. we can barely afford to buy food still but its still consistent money. we have our own business on the side that we want to be our main thing. it is going well and we suspect in the next few years we will be able to support ourselves fully with it. unfortunately Avery cannot last a few years in starbucks. 

Avery says he can only last a few more months. he also talks about how hes felt stuck and sad all the time. he hates pretty much every job he does after about a year. im pretty sure he has ADHD and we know he is autistic. he has panic attacks about going to work often and has had meltdowns and told me that when i talk about my feelings im being selfish, and then after tells me that he didn't mean it and doesn't think that. 

he lays in bed on tiktok or twitter for hours, doesn't pay much attention to me, and then gets just.. sad whenever i point out that we don't do anything together anymore. we haven't had sex in months. he tells me that he wants to but ""there's a block in my brain"" he described it like sometimes a task is broken up in his head into like, three steps, and sometimes its broken down into twenty steps, and sex has been twenty or more steps in his head for months and he cant get past how overwhelming it feels. he also has said to me that he thinks his brain doesn't think he deserves to do anything for himself. ive tried taking away the pressure of sex and taking the lead but i have truama with being forced to top and its hard for me to push through that too often. there are other things he described like this. like watching shows is too many steps or too overwhelming or playing games is like that. like his brain is taking away every single good thing in his life. 

ive been losing sleep over this. hes been so sad and so anxious its so worrying. i also unfortunately have BPD and hes my favorite person. i cannot separate his feelings from mine very easily. we've both been eating less, sleeping less, and just overall have been having a shit time. 

i am terrified of needles, but im trans and need my testosterone shot. usually Avery would help me do it, and he was doing it for a long time, but one week we forgot and since then hes said there's too many steps in that too. i can barley even look at needles let alone do the shot myself. something that bugs me a lot is that hes also trans and used to take T when i did, but stopped when he stopped giving it to me, but he passes. he doesn't have to try anymore. i do. i do not pass yet and i need more testosterone to be able to pass as a man. another thing is we need starbucks for our top surgery. if he leaves i cant get it. neither can he. or at least we would have to save up a lot of money. he doesn't have as much dysphoria with his chest. mine on the other hand is huge (pun intended) and i cant bind because im disabled. its not on purpose that hes doing all this but it hurts a lot. 

ive talked to him about all this. he just gets so sad. it seems like hes trying his hardest but i can only completely emotionally support him for so long. i don't know what to do. every time i bring up how im sad he just.. gets really sad and says he is sorry but nothing changes. hes working through burnout which i know is hard but i feel like im single. i told him that and he just looked like i broke his heart. 

im just at a loss. i have been helping him constantly for months. cleaning the apartment, driving him places, being the only person he talks about his feelings with. and i feel like im going insane. we have these little moments where everything is going well and we're having fun and then, seemingly out of nowhere, he gets sad and then goes to lay down. and thats it. i don't get anything out of him other than him showing me a tiktok or something. 

does anyone know what we can do? there's a lot of things i know he needs to do but i just want help with making our day to day easier. how can he cope with a shit job? how can i not completely run myself into the ground when this is every day of my life? does anyone know what to do about the 'one task turning into a million steps' thing? im just so lost.

TLDR:: i need help with my AuDHD husband and getting our life back on track. hes got depression and SAD and its making us both stressed constantly.

It doesn't matter how successful they are in real life, or how many up votes they recieve on a given comment or post, none of that translates into guidance if they can't pull their head out of their own arrears.

When posing a thoughtful question as a post, even seeking advice, it should be carefully noted that a range of opinions will come at you, which is helpful to guage the spectrum of viewpoints, and even to narrow in on what you feel is most helpful, but none of them is 'right', per se, they live in relation to one another, as 'opinions'. An opinion is directly relational to one's life experience, and that ranges quite a bit.

A 'mentor' is someone you meet in real life. Someone can seem totally together online, and have a life that's a total wreck. You need to find something admirable in a potential mentor, which is a quality that is beyond words, as a complete package. You don't want to take life lessons from people who don't have this overall sense of 'togetherness', which isn't merely financial or material, but more of a exuded 'peace of mind'.

Approaching someone for help might be as simple as asking if you can buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brain for an hour or so. This is what is commonly referred to as a 'friendship', but with a higher purpose. You might be surprised how open people are to this request, and find it reassuring about the state of humanity as a whole, that people are usually more than willing to help other people, within limits.

It's important not to elevate such a person beyond the standards of human care. People only have so much time, and you can only absorb so much at a time. Also, nobody is perfect, nobody can distill and bottle their life's lessons in a highly systematic way, the point is to get a 'feel' for what makes them successful (as a package), and to hear their reflections on your circumstances. A casual mentorship isn't the same as being an apprentice or having a trainer for a new occupation, but in having a neutral party, of one's own gender (over the age of 40) who can be a sort of guide, *without a power dynamic at play.*

These sorts of relationships tend not to last forever, even if you continue to be friends, the extent to which any individual can maintain this aura for you will have a limitation. Meeting two to three times per month over the course of several months, tapering off over a year, might be enough to nudge you into a new trajectory in life. Your job is to show growth, and to try to implement any advice they give, and provide updates over time to help suggest any further guidance needed.

The mode of this sort of friendship is casual but professional. They don't need to hear or deal with every little problem you may have at any given time, but the key is 'absorption'. Because parents and peers are often too close to us to remain objective about our deeper selves, this relationship is a reprieve from hyper-relationality. 

Asking someone to play this role for you should be direct and intentional. Not everything they say will be applicable to you, but hearing things you might not like to hear is a matter of digestability and openness. It can take a while to implement real changes in your life, but subconsciously one is constantly seeking improvement and personal growth, which has a mysterious effect upon the psyche.

This is not 'therapy', it is a certain type of friendship, and should only cost you the price of a cup of coffee or occasionally lunch. This person is not a teacher so much as a exemplar of being human. Being human is not being perfect, it is being mature and well-adjusted to this strange life, humble but confident.

Even when it went well?,"This happens to me all the time and it’s honestly one of the most confusing flavors of anxiety, because the social thing will go well. Like genuinely fine. People laughed, nobody died, I didn’t say anything cancel-worthy. Then I get home and my brain is like, alright, time to ruin your evening.

A recent example: I met up with a couple friends for drinks. Nothing intense. Just sitting, talking, normal human stuff. While I was there I felt good. Present. Even a little proud of myself for not overthinking every sentence. I remember thinking, wow, maybe I’m finally becoming a normal person.

I get home, take my shoes off, and within ten minutes it hits. My chest feels tight, my stomach drops, and I get that weird buzzy feeling like I drank too much coffee, even though I didn’t. Then the replay starts.

Did I talk too much about work?  
Was that joke annoying?  
Why did I say “you too” when the bartender said enjoy your night?  
Did my friend’s face look weird when I said that one thing?  
Maybe they were bored. Maybe I overshared. Maybe I was too quiet. Maybe I was too loud.

And here’s the dumbest part: while I’m spiraling, I also know that none of them are sitting at home replaying my comments like it’s a true crime podcast. They’re probably brushing their teeth or watching Netflix. Meanwhile I’m in bed conducting a full post-game analysis like I’m being graded.

I’ve realized it’s usually a mix of two things.

First, the adrenaline crash. When I’m out, I’m “on.” Smiling, tracking the conversation, reading the room, trying to be normal. Even if I’m having a good time, my body is still working overtime. Then I get home and the energy drops and my nervous system goes, okay cool, now that we’re safe, let’s panic.

Second, overstimulation. Lights, noise, talking, decisions, social cues. It’s like my brain has 40 tabs open. The second I’m alone in my apartment, all the tabs start auto-playing at once.

What helps, at least a little, is doing a decompression routine on purpose. Not a fancy one. Just something that tells my body, we’re done now.

I’ll drink water, eat something small even if I don’t feel like it, and do something brain-off. Shower. Comfort show. Stupid phone game. Anything that stops me from lying in bed replaying the night like it’s evidence.

Sometimes I literally say out loud: That went fine. I’m just coming down from being social.

It doesn’t magically fix it, but it takes the edge off. And honestly, just knowing it’s a pattern helps. It’s not a sign I messed up. It’s just my nervous system doing that annoying thing where it freaks out after the danger is gone.

If you get this too, what’s your version of it? Is it more physical crash, or more mental replay and shame spiral? Because for me it depends on the day, and the fixes are slightly different.",1,1766934751.0,AnxietyHealing,1,1.0,False

I inquired if they host gatherings, and they were super excited to work with us to come up with a reception brunch menu.  it was their flexibility that made this happen - finding a caterer that was happy to accommodate our dietary restrictions.  our goal was to have an entire menu I could enjoy, since it would be my first time (after a lifetime of being vegetarian) being at a gathering where I could eat everything.  they even offered to add little critter ornaments to the table decorations, which were so cute!  

our guests were mostly family members who love meat.  none of them commented on the lack of meat, because we had satiating options that are normal brunch food.  instead, we received tons of compliments on the meal and venue!  I asked one of the biggest meat eaters afterwards if he was satisfied by our meal, and he said he genuinely didn’t notice it was meatless.

Look, I'm not here to waste your time.

If you're reading this, your teeth are crooked, your bite is off, or someone finally convinced you to do something about that smile you've been hiding in photos since high school.

**Here's what actually matters when choosing an orthodontist in Broward County.**

---

## Skip the Marketing BS – Here's What You Actually Need

Most orthodontist websites look identical. Same stock photos. Same ""we care about your smile"" copy. Same promises.

Here's what you *actually* need to evaluate:

**1. Technology vs Experience (Both Matter)**

* Digital scanners &gt; goopy impressions (if you know, you know)
* 3D treatment planning shows you the end result BEFORE you commit
* But fancy equipment means nothing if the person using it has only straightened 50 smiles

**Ask them:** ""How many cases like mine have you completed?"" Not total cases. Cases. Like. Yours.

**2. The Invisalign vs Braces Decision Nobody Explains Honestly**

Let me save you the sales pitch:

* **Braces work faster** for complex cases (severe crowding, rotation, bite issues)
* **Invisalign looks better** but requires discipline (yes, 22 hours/day actually means 22 hours)
* Braces don't care if you forget them at Chipotle

*Reality check:* If you can't remember to put your retainer in now, Invisalign will torture you.

**3. Payment Plans That Don't Destroy Your Life**

Average cost in Broward: $3,500-$8,000

Red flags:

* Zero transparency on pricing until you're in the chair
* Pressure to decide TODAY for a ""special discount""
* Payment plans with interest rates higher than your credit card

Green flags:

* Clear pricing breakdown upfront
* Multiple payment options (monthly plans, insurance coordination, HSA/FSA)
* No-pressure consultations (if they're good, they don't need to pressure you)

---

## Questions That Separate Good from Great

Walk into consultations with these:

1. **""What's your revision policy if I'm not happy with the results?""** (If they hesitate, run)
2. **""How often will I actually see the orthodontist vs assistants?""** (You're paying for expertise, not just the brand name)
3. **""What happens if I move mid-treatment?""** (Life happens. They should have a plan)
4. **""Can I see before/after photos of similar cases?""** (Not just their best work – cases like YOURS)

---

## The Broward-Specific Advantage

You're in one of the most competitive orthodontic markets in Florida. Use this.

* Multiple consultations should be **free** (if they charge, that's weird)
* You have options from Coral Springs to Pembroke Pines to Fort Lauderdale
* Don't settle because it's ""convenient"" – you're wearing this stuff for 12-24 months

**Pro move:** Get 3 consultations. Compare treatment plans, timelines, and costs. You'll spot the outliers immediately.

---

## What Actually Matters for Results

Not the free iPad they give you.

Not the arcade in the waiting room.

Not even the fancy coffee machine.

**What matters:**

* Precision in diagnosis (digital x-rays, bite analysis, facial structure consideration)
* Realistic timeline (if someone promises 6 months when everyone else says 18, question it)
* Retention plan (your teeth WILL try to move back – what's the long-term strategy?)

---

## Insurance Reality Check

Most dental insurance covers $1,000-$2,000 for orthodontics.

That's it. Once in a lifetime usually.

Make sure your orthodontist:

* Files claims directly (you don't want to chase reimbursements)
* Knows exactly what your plan covers BEFORE you start
* Offers flexible payment for the remaining balance

---

## Bottom Line

The ""best"" orthodontist in Broward isn't the one with the most Instagram followers or the biggest billboard on I-95.

It's the one who:

* Listens to what YOU want (not what they want to sell)
* Shows you proof they can deliver it
* Makes the financial part manageable
* Has a system to handle problems when they come up (because they will)

Your smile is going to be with you for the rest of your life. The 6 hours you spend doing consultations now will save you years of regret.

**Do the work upfront. Your future self will thank you.**

the audio and video quality are awful as usual 

complaining about the Boxing Day sales being rubbish 

'this was advertised as a great shopping district of Great Yarmouth but its turned into a food court' 

'people are coming for their christmas chips Gaby look'

I think christmas chips are some sort of Great Yarmouth tradition apparently. 

'We'll never forget when Great Yarmouth had the ice skating rink here' 

'There just seagull crap everywhere!'

You can hear some random person roaring in the background. Maybe thats a Yarmouth tradition too?

We're getting a walk every day till new years! Christ 

is that a pound stretcher? I live in London so I haven't seen one in years and years.

They discuss how a local burger place can sell a small hotdog and or burger for a pound and make a profit. 

'It's like stepping back in time, going in there to get your cup of tea or burger before McDonalds became a thing in the UK' Yes because now McDonalds exists no one ever went to get a burger anywhere else did they

What is Tim's source for all his local history? He seems to be rambling based off nothing. 

Tim used the word facade wrong

Gaby said 'jack all' then apologised to Tim for it. Yet she doesn't apologise for other derogatory language. 

How did gaby go on students nights out when she never was a student?

I have never heard of the concept of 'summertime pubs' before like Gaby says. Maybe its a Great Yarmouth thing?

Someone from the stream has approached them on the street. I strongly feel like Gaby and Tim are exploiting these peoples parasocial relationships with their followers here to get money off them, which I find truly despicable. Tim and Gaby seem eager to get away from the viewer.

hello all!! tomorrow i am having my first home visit and i am just really not sure what to expect! 

i am deep cleaning all day to prepare 🤣

if anyone has experiences or can answer these questions i would love to hear to put my nerves at ease!

- how long was the visit?
- is it like a normal probation meeting but just in your home?
- are they just looking around or fully searching through your things? (closets, drawers, cabinets, etc)
- should i have things to offer like water/coffee?

also this is unrelated, but can probation officers accept gifts? i was thinking about getting a starbucks/dunkin gift card for my po since it is the holidays but i have no idea if they can accept gifts or not

Some of my major considerations for purchasing were ease of use, cleanliness of the frothing system and user profiles.  Of course I started researching after purchasing it, went down all the rabbit holes including this subreddit (thanks!), and am now more undecided than ever.  I’ve mentally requalified this purchase as a _trial_ and have identified what appears to be an appropriate set of tips and tricks to get started - what am I missing?

1. My understanding is that I should run 10-20 cups through to settle the grinder and brew pathways; early pucks may be wet and sloppy but things should tighten up

2. Leave the stock grinder setting for 50-100 cups before meddling with it 

3. Use the machines coffee/strength settings as well as temperature settings 

4. Use whole milk for best results with LatteGo

5. I went with Lavazza Super Crema whole beans to start; medium roast for trial  

6. Adjusting cup volume allows for adjustment of water through puck = more volume, more dilution. It sounds like this is the key adjustment to affect taste. 

Should this end in disappointment, I’ll likely try the DeLonghi Rivelia (RedDot design winner 🙃).  I wanted to keep this purchase to ~$1000 USD. ",1,1766933835.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

But she loved nature and wanted our kids to experience the outdoors. That is when we discovered a glamping house rental in upstate New York that changed everything.

This was not a tent. It was a fully furnished cabin-style structure with a king-sized bed, electricity, heating, and even a small kitchenette. Large windows on three sides gave us panoramic forest views, and the deck had comfortable lounge chairs where we spent our mornings drinking coffee. The kids had their own sleeping loft that they thought was the coolest thing ever.

We spent days hiking and exploring, then came back to comfort and hot showers. My wife was so impressed that she started researching options to maybe invest in one for rental income. She found suppliers offering various glamping structures on platforms like Alibaba, with designs ranging from dome tents to fully equipped tiny houses. Some even came with solar panels and composting toilets for off-grid locations.

That trip converted our entire family into outdoor enthusiasts. We have stayed at four different glamping sites since then, each with its own unique style and amenities.

1pxt7xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1pxt7xg/confessions_of_a_princeton_engineering_graduate/,confessions of a Princeton engineering graduate,"I used to think I sucked at studying.

I knew I was lazy, but it felt deeper than that. Like I just wasn’t built for it. I couldn’t focus in lectures. I’d sit down with notes and feel my brain slide off the page. Nothing stuck. Meanwhile, people in my major seemed to just power through. I assumed they had something I didn’t.

I tried to “fix” it by forcing myself to study the right way. Quiet rooms. Long sessions. Pages of notes. Just sit there and read. It felt awful, but I told myself that was part of the process. i thought studying was supposed to feel ""heavy""

it's not. you're just learning the wrong way.

**truth is - you have a dog brain.**

You want lil Oscar to do PAW when you hold out your hand. What do you do?

You repeat the action again and again

until Oscar lifts up his leg in frustration

then you make a huge deal of it

treats, pets, attention

and then you repeat, again and again, 

until Oscar learns that lifting up his leg when he sees your hand = good time

So you need to ask:

“What actually keeps me engaged long enough to learn anything?”

People act like if your method isn’t serious-looking, it doesn’t count. Like learning has to be quiet and uncomfortable to be legitimate.

But your brain doesn’t care about legitimacy. It cares about whether you stay.

For me, the uncomfortable truth was that reading had never been my best entry point. It felt slow and visually exhausting. Audio, on the other hand, clicked immediately. I could listen, pause, think, explain things out loud. I stayed present. I could do it for hours on end, revisit parts that felt vague, listen while doing something else

My brain didn’t fight me.

Admitting that felt like I was lowering the bar. But the results were impossible to ignore. I remembered more. I showed up more consistently. Studying stopped feeling like something I had to force.

Your brain repeats what felt tolerable or rewarding last time. If studying always feels like friction with no payoff, your brain learns to avoid it. 

That’s not weakness - it's just your dog brain conditioning. The same way you learn to reach for your phone without thinking, you can learn to avoid studying

We already trick ourselves constantly. We drink coffee to focus. We put on music to work. We choose environments that make things easier. Somehow studying is the one area where we pretend suffering is a requirement.

It isn’t.

If goth mommy asmr makes you focus, use it.

If you focus better listening than reading, do that. 

If you need movement, do some pushups. 

If something a little weird or unserious helps you stay present, that’s fine too. Your brain doesn’t have an ego. Only you do.

**The goal isn’t to look like a good student. It’s to actually learn.**

Once you drop the shame, you stop fighting yourself. Studying becomes something you can tolerate. Sometimes even enjoy. And that’s more than enough.

You don’t need to love studying. You just need it to stop repelling you.

If your method makes it easier to start, easier to stay, and easier to finish, it’s valid. Even if it looks strange. Even if you had to trick yourself to get there.",1,1766933747.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

**Section 1: The Feast of Gods**

**\[Time: 6 B.N.E. (Before New Era), Winter\]** **\[Location: Long Beach, ""The Crystal Palace"" Convention Center\]**

The Pacific breeze carried a salty tang, but it couldn't disperse the arrogance filling this glass castle.

This was ""The Crystal Palace,"" the supreme annual sanctuary of the Old Era's academia. The massive glass curtain walls refracted the harsh California sunlight, as if proclaiming to the world: Here lies the summit of wisdom, the terminus of truth.

A cheap rental car, its rear bumper still dented, pulled up at the venue's entrance.

Nano struggled to squeeze out of the cramped back seat, tugging at the black suit he had bought specifically for the occasion—which still fit poorly, tight and cheap. He felt miserable all over, the tie strangling his neck like a muzzle on a grizzly bear.

Beside him, Enki was adjusting his grey hoodie in the rearview mirror. Even for such a grand occasion, he refused to wear formal attire, merely throwing an ill-fitting blazer over his hoodie as a token gesture. He looked like a mischievous boy crashing a party for adults.

Only Nin appeared calm. Wearing his immutable black turtleneck, he stared blankly at the magnificent structure before him. The bloodshot veins from chronic sleep deprivation remained in the corners of his eyes, looking particularly stark against his pale face.

""Let's go."" Enki took a deep breath, plastering on his trademark smile—full of affinity, yet never reaching the bottom of his eyes. ""Let's see what leftovers that Old Dragon has prepared for us.""

Walking into the main exhibition hall was like stepping into a grotesque, futuristic temple.

Giant holographic projections hovered in mid-air, scrolling through complex neural network topologies. The air smelled of expensive champagne, static electricity, and a scent only found in crowds of supremely confident people—the smell of Power.

Everyone here wore tailored suits, with badges of different colors hanging from their chests. Purple for ""Speaker,"" Gold for ""Sponsor."" Nano, the lowest form of visitor, wore a badge of shameful Grey.

In the dead center of the hall towered a massive Blue booth.

It was the territory of the Tower of Googol.

It occupied the prime spot, larger than all the surrounding booths combined. Dozens of High Priests (Engineers) in T-shirts printed with the four-colored Logo stood under spotlights, arrogantly demonstrating their miracles to the onlookers.

""Look at this compute! Look at this elegant architecture!"" A priest pointed to the screen showing the Ghost (Alpha) that had defeated the Human Chess King, his voice soaring. ""We have solved the Game. Next, we will solve Science, solve Life, solve Everything!""

Enki stood on the periphery of the crowd, hands in his pockets, his gaze dark and sinister. He watched the Blue Logo being worshipped by thousands, the corner of his mouth twitching. It was jealousy, and the rage of being marginalized.

""Hey, isn't that Nin?""

A grating voice rang out. Several young men in Googol uniforms walked over. They had once been Enki’s Igigi, but in that desperate winter, they had chosen to defect to the powerful Old Overlord.

""What? Still playing with your mud in that broken warehouse?"" The leader of the traitors held a glass of free sparkling wine, his eyes sweeping contemptuously over Nin’s pilling sweater. ""I heard you guys are still banging your heads against LSTMs? Stop wasting time. The sequence model is a dead end. Come look at the real future; *this* is what God builds.""

He pointed to the massive array of TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) models behind him.

Nin didn't speak. He just watched the man quietly, his eyes looking at him as if he were a stone without a soul.

""We don't need your advice."" Enki stepped in front of Nin. His smile was still brilliant, but Nano saw that Enki’s hands in his pockets were clenched into fists, knuckles white.

""Good luck, Enki."" The traitor shrugged, laughing as he turned away. ""Don't come begging us to take you in when you can't pay the electricity bill.""

A low ripple of laughter rose from the surroundings.

Nano felt hot blood rush to his head. He took a step forward, his massive frame casting a shadow—the precursor of a beast preparing to tear its prey apart.

""Nano."" Nin reached out and stopped him.

Nin’s voice was light, yet it carried a chill: ""Don't get angry. They are celebrating victory. But they don't know... they are celebrating the sunset of the Old Era.""

Enki turned around, his face terrifyingly gloomy. ""I need some air. Nin, go find what you're looking for. Nano, keep people away from me.""

Enki disappeared toward the VIP lounge. Nin vanished like a ghost into the Academic Papers section.

Nano was left in the crowded aisle.

There were too many people here. Everyone held a wine glass, discussing multi-million dollar funding rounds and parameter scales. Nano felt like a piece of rotting meat thrown into a perfume bottle—completely out of place.

Agitated, he tried to squeeze out of the crowd to smoke a cigarette outside.

*Thump.*

At a corner, he accidentally bumped into someone.

It was a strange fellow.

In a venue full of suits and geek T-shirts, this man wore a black leather biker jacket.

He wasn't tall—a head shorter than Nano—but when Nano bumped into him, it felt like hitting a slab of hard granite. The man didn't move an inch; instead, Nano stumbled back.

""Sorry,"" Nano muttered instinctively.

The man turned around.

It was a typical Oriental face, wearing a pair of thick black-framed glasses, his grey-white hair combed meticulously. There was no anger of offense on his face; instead, he wore a shrewd, playful smile.

What Nano found most strange was that the man seemed to be surrounded by a faint green halo—it was just the reflection of a giant green billboard on the side of the hall, but reflecting off his leather jacket, it made him look like a ranger from a radioactive wasteland.

The man didn't look at Nano. His gaze went over Nano’s shoulder, landing on the Blue Booth of the Tower of Googol, surrounded by crowds in the distance.

""Lively, isn't it?"" The Leather Jacket Guest said softly, his voice raspy and magnetic.

Nano paused, unsure how to respond. ""Uh... yes. They are showing off the latest chips.""

""Chips?""

The Leather Jacket Guest let out a dismissive chuckle. He extended a finger and pushed up the black-framed glasses on the bridge of his nose. The lenses reflected that arrogant Blue Tower.

""Those aren't chips, big guy."" The Leather Jacket Guest shook his head, his tone carrying the unique arrogance and disdain of an Arms Dealer. ""Those are building blocks for children.""

He turned his head, sizing Nano up through his lenses. The gaze was as sharp as a scalpel fresh from the furnace, seemingly piercing through Nano’s cheap suit to see the beast beneath.

""Tell your boss,"" the Leather Jacket Guest said suddenly, a mysterious arc curling his lips. ""**If** he wants to build a real God, don't beg those who play with blocks. Come find the Blacksmith.""

""W... What?"" Nano was confused.

But the Leather Jacket Guest offered no explanation. Like a gust of wind, hands in his jacket pockets, he turned and melted into the crowded tide.

Nano stood frozen, the tip of his nose still holding a faint scent from the man—not perfume, but the smell of solder, liquid nitrogen, and cooling high-temperature metal.

It was the smell of Fire.

Before Nano could think further, Nin’s urgent shout came from not far away.

""Nano! Come here! Quick!""

Nano turned to see Nin standing in an inconspicuous corner, clutching a few thin sheets of paper tightly in his hand. His whole body was trembling violently, as if he had just touched a high-voltage wire.

Nano glanced in the direction where the Leather Jacket Guest had vanished, then at Nin in his state of mania.

He vaguely felt that this feast, belonging to the Old Overlord, was about to be completely overturned by something.

  


 **Chapter 2, Section 2: The Eighth Rune**

Nano fought his way through the noisy crowd, running in the direction Ning had shouted from.

It was a corner at the very edge of the exhibition hall, near the emergency exit. There were no spotlights here, no holographic projections, only a few cheap folding tables piled with discarded flyers and empty coffee cups. This was the ""garbage dump"" belonging to the marginalized researchers who garnered no respect.

Ning stood before one of the tables, his back to the clamor of the venue. His body was rigid as a statue, save for his hands, which were trembling violently.

""Ning? What's wrong? Enki is looking for us..."" Nano ran up, gasping for breath.

Ning didn't answer. As if possessed, he stared fixedly at a printout on the table.

It wasn't a beautifully bound official booklet, but a draft that hadn't even been stapled. The edges of the paper were curled, and a brown ring of coffee stain marred the surface. It looked like trash—something a Googol researcher had printed out casually, found useless, and tossed here.

Nano leaned in for a look. The title was simple, simple to the point of arrogance:

**""Attention Is All You Need""**

Beneath the title, the names of eight authors were printed side by side.

""What is this?"" Nano asked, confused. ""Another update patch for some translation software?""

""Patch?"" Ning let out a neurotic laugh. He jerked his head up, his bloodshot eyes filled with the fear and awe of someone witnessing a miracle.

""Fools... They are all fools..."" Ning’s voice was raspy, his finger tracing the mathematical model on the paper frantically. ""The Priests at Googol think this is just a toy for machine translation. They threw it in the corner like a used napkin.""

Ning’s finger stopped on the core architecture diagram—a complex maze of arrows and boxes. In the center of the maze was a module labeled **""Multi-Head Attention.""**

""Do you understand this, big guy?"" Ning pointed at the module, his eyes feverish. ""The old LSTM was blind. It could only grope forward word by word, like a blind man feeling an elephant. By the time it read the end of the sentence, it had already forgotten the beginning.""

Ning took a deep breath, as if invisible fire were burning on that paper.

""But this... this thing... It is the Eye of God.""

""It no longer needs to read in sequence. It can see all the words at once—see all the past, all the future. It can understand the connection between every word and every other word in an instant, no matter how far apart they are.""

Ning’s finger slashed across the names of the eight authors.

""These eight people... they don't know what they have written. They think they wrote code, but in truth, they have carved the Eighth Rune. This is the final key to breaking the seal on AI memory. With this, our Clay Man will no longer be a goldfish; it will possess Eternal Memory.""

Nano only half-understood, but he felt the shockwave. He looked at the coffee-stained paper and suddenly felt it was heavier than the multi-million dollar Blue Booth nearby.

Just as Ning was about to stuff the draft into his jacket, Nano’s gaze was drawn to something else on the table.

Beside the paper, buried under a pile of messy flyers, lay a black card.

Nano reached out with his thick fingers and pinched it.

It was a hard card of excellent quality, pitch black, bearing no name and no phone number. Only in the dead center was a green symbol—it looked like an eye, or perhaps some infinite, swirling geometric shape.

""What is this?"" Nano handed the card to Ning.

Ning took it, his pupils constricting slightly.

""I've seen this symbol somewhere..."" Ning muttered. He recalled Enki’s despair when complaining about the lack of money for graphics cards, and the rumors about that mysterious ""Armorer.""

Ning suddenly looked up, staring in the direction Nano had come from—the direction where the man in the leather jacket had disappeared.

""He was here."" Ning’s voice dropped low. ""The guy in the leather jacket... he came to this table. He read this paper.""

""You mean the guy who bumped into me?"" Nano was surprised.

""He understood this paper earlier than those arrogant Priests at Googol."" Ning’s thumb rubbed the sharp edge of the card. ""He left this card... He is waiting for us. He is waiting for the only people who can understand this paper to find him.""

Ning solemnly tucked the black-and-green card into his inner pocket, then suddenly grabbed Nano by the shoulder.

Ning’s nails dug deep into Nano’s flesh. In his dead-water eyes, a monstrous wave rose—the resolve of a desperate gambler going all in.

""Big guy, prep the car.""

""Where are we going? To find Enki?""

""No. We leave *now*."" Ning grabbed the coffee-stained paper from the table, clutching it to his chest as if protecting a newborn baby. ""We are taking this back to the 'Open Abzu.' Before the high-ups at Googol react, before they realize they've lost the blueprints for a nuclear weapon...""

Ning stared into Nano’s eyes, articulating every word:

""We are going to steal it. This is the Fire of Prometheus we were looking for.""

Nano nodded. In that moment, he felt he was no longer a driver, but an accomplice in the theft of celestial fire.

Just as they turned to leave, a thunderous applause erupted from the center of the exhibition hall behind them. The Priests of Googol were celebrating their new model's further mastery of Go.

Ning stopped and looked back at the radiant Blue Booth one last time, a desolate, mocking sneer curling his lips.

""Celebrate, Overlords of the Old Era. Celebrate to your heart's content.""

""Your sunset was just written on this piece of scrap paper.""

  


 **Chapter 2, Section 3: The Iconoclasm**

A torrential storm raged in the night sky over San Francisco. Raindrops hammered like iron nails against the tin roof of the ""Open Abzu"" warehouse, creating a deafening roar.

Inside, the air was thick enough to choke on. Dozens of Igigi gathered around Ningishzida’s whiteboard, staring at the High Priest who had just returned from Long Beach.

Rainwater still dripped from Ning’s body. His black turtleneck sweater clung wetly to his skin, making him look even more skeletal. In his hand, he tightly clutched the draft paper stolen from Googol, now crumpled from his grip.

""Ning, how was Long Beach?"" A senior Igigi asked tentatively. ""Googol's new model...""

""That was a miracle,"" Ning interrupted. His voice was soft, yet it sliced through the air like a knife.

Ning jerked his head up, his bloodshot eyes scanning the rows of humming servers in the warehouse—their life's work for the past two years, running the old LSTM architecture.

""But *this*..."" Ning pointed at the servers, his eyes filled with disgust, as if looking at a pile of rotting garbage. ""This is filth.""

Dead silence fell over the room.

""Turn them off,"" Ning ordered coldly. ""All of them.""

""What?"" The Igigi thought they had misheard. ""Ning, that's two years of data! The model just learned to write sonnets...""

""It is an idiot with a seven-second memory!"" Ning suddenly exploded, hurling the crumpled paper onto the floor. ""We wasted too much time in this dead end! RNN is wrong! LSTM is wrong! We have been trying to teach a goldfish to recite 'The Odyssey'!""

Ning turned to Nano, standing in the shadows, and extended a finger, pointing at the main storage array in the server room:

""Big guy, do it. Pull the plug.""

Nano froze. He looked at Marco in the corner.

Lying on the bed, Marco wore a smile that was sorrowful yet relieved. He nodded gently—a silent farewell to the old shell.

Nano took a deep breath and walked with heavy steps toward the server racks.

""Stop!"" ""What are you doing?!"" ""You maniac!""

The previously quiet Igigi instantly erupted. They rushed forward, trying to stop Nano. That was code they had stayed up countless nights writing; it was their child, their life.

But against Nano’s massive frame, their obstruction was as futile as waves crashing against a reef. Nano shoved aside two engineers trying to hug his legs and reached the core storage cabinet.

There was no complex shutdown procedure.

Nano reached out with his shovel-like hands and grabbed the handles of the hard drive array, which was still spinning at high speed.

*Snap.*

With the crisp sound of physical latches breaking, the first hard drive was forcibly ripped out.

Then the second, the third...

The stream of code on the screens froze instantly, then collapsed into red error messages.

That clumsy Clay Man who had once asked *""Is it black outside?""*, that old AI who wrote awkward poetry, let out a final electronic sigh in this moment, and then vanished utterly into the darkness.

""NO!!!""

A young engineer fell to his knees, weeping in a breakdown. More Igigi grew angry; they grabbed keyboards, wrenches, some even picking up steel pipes from the floor, circling Ning and Nano with red eyes.

""What is this?!"" ""You destroyed everything!"" ""We quit! We're leaving this madhouse!""

It was a mutiny. In despair and heartbreak, the faith of these technology believers collapsed.

Nano stood in front of Ning, muscles tensed, ready to welcome the incoming violence. Ning stood there expressionless, like a statue ready for martyrdom.

""Shut up, all of you!""

A roar, amplified by a megaphone, drowned out all the noise.

Everyone turned toward the sound.

Enki, at some point, had climbed atop the highest stack of server crates in the center of the warehouse. Wearing his iconic hoodie and holding a megaphone, he looked down on the riot from high above.

He didn't look panicked; instead, he looked abnormally excited. It was the look of a gambler about to go All-In.

""Why are you crying?"" Enki’s voice was filled with seduction. ""What are you crying for? For that toy that only parrots words? For that waste that can't even remember who it is?""

""We are building a God!"" An Igigi shouted from below. ""Not playing house!""

""Exactly! We *are* building a God!"" Enki jumped down from the crate, striding into the middle of the crowd. His aura was so strong that the angry mob unconsciously parted a way for him.

""But before, we were building a God with mud."" Enki walked to Ning's side, bent down, and picked up the crumpled paper from the floor. He held it high, like lifting a Bible.

""Look at this! This is garbage thrown away by Googol, but Ning understood it. This is a Map! This is the Nautical Chart to the New World! With this, we won't build a goldfish; we will build an Omniscient, Omnipotent Titan!""

""So what?"" Someone retorted. ""The new architecture needs a thousand times the compute! Enlil has cut off the supply! We can't even pay the electricity bill!""

Enki smiled. It was a smile of supreme confidence, perhaps even a touch of cunning.

He reached into the pocket of his hoodie and slowly, theatrically, pulled something out.

It wasn't money, nor was it a hard drive.

It was a black card with sharp edges.

Enki held the card high. The dim light hit the green geometric shape in the center, reflecting a ghostly cold light—The Eye of Compute.

""Enlil abandoned us. Googol mocked us. So what?""

Enki’s voice dropped low and powerful, like a demon whispering:

""We don't need charity from the Rocket Man, and we don't need validation from the Old Overlord. I have found a new Ally.""

He waved the black-and-green card in his hand:

""The owner of this card is The Armorer. He is the Lord who controls the Green Flame. The furnace in his hands can forge an engine more furious than Enlil’s rockets.""

Enki looked around, staring at those confused, angry, yet wavering faces:

""The old idols have been smashed. Now, on these ruins, using this Map (Transformer) and this Engine (GPU), we will build a *True* God.""

""**Those who stay will be the Founding Fathers of the New World. Those who want to leave, the door is over there.**""

Deathly silence filled the warehouse. Only the sound of rain smashing on the roof remained.

No one moved. No one mentioned the pulled hard drives anymore.

Nano stood aside, looking at the card glowing green in Enki’s hand, then at Ning’s fanatical eyes beside him. He knew the gamble had begun.

They had just burned their boats. Now, the only way out was to swim into that unknown, bottomless ocean.

  


 **Chapter 2, Section 4: The Forge of the Armorer**

**\[Location: Santa Clara, An Unmarked Underground Bunker\]**

The location wasn't San Francisco, but an inconspicuous underground bunker in Santa Clara.

When the heavy airlock door slid open, Nano thought he had stepped into another dimension.

White fog—liquid nitrogen vapor—rolled beneath their feet, rising past their knees. The air was bone-chillingly cold, yet thick with the stimulating scent of ozone. Above the white mist, countless green indicator lights breathed in the darkness, resembling a ghostly forest of the netherworld.

""Don't touch anything, big guy."" Enki walked ahead, his voice carrying a rare tone of reverence. ""Every silicon wafer here is worth more than your life.""

They cut through the fog and arrived at the laboratory's core.

There stood a Black Obelisk.

It wasn't tall—only about waist-high—but it radiated the oppressive presence of a mountain. Its body was encased in jet-black metal, with sharp geometric lines carved into its sides, and a cold green light glowing faintly from within. It didn't look like a computer; it looked like a nuclear reactor from the future.

A man was standing before the obelisk.

He had his back to Enki and Nano, holding a precision electric torque wrench, personally tightening the final screw on the chassis side panel.

Despite the terrifyingly low temperature caused by the liquid nitrogen, he still wore that iconic black leather biker jacket.

Hearing footsteps, the man paused his work. He turned around, pushing up the black-framed glasses on his nose. The lenses reflected the ghostly green glow of the obelisk.

He was **Gibil**—the Armorer of Silicon Valley, the God of Compute.

""You're late, Enki."" Gibil’s voice was raspy and powerful, carrying the metallic texture of someone who spent their life communing with machines. ""For this beast, I haven't slept in forty-eight hours.""

Gibil patted the black obelisk beside him, as if patting a wild horse he had just tamed.

""**DGX-1.** Inside this black box, I've squeezed in eight of the strongest GPU hearts in existence. One second of its thinking equals ten thousand years of human calculation. This is an artwork, Enki. This is the aesthetics of violence.""

Nano looked at the black box, his throat dry. He could feel the heat radiating from it—fire forcibly suppressed by liquid nitrogen.

""It's beautiful."" Enki stepped forward, reaching out as if to touch it, but stopped in mid-air, his eyes greedy. ""With this, I can ignite the Fire of Prometheus.""

""Pity, it's not for you.""

Gibil coldly interrupted Enki’s obsession. He picked up a rag and wiped the grease from his hands.

""The invoice is already printed. The recipient is the Southern X Launch Site. **Enlil** ordered it three months ago. Paid in full.""

Enki’s face stiffened. ""Enlil? What does he want with this nuclear reactor?""

""To teach cars to recognize roads."" Gibil shrugged, a trace of imperceptible mockery in his tone. ""He's going to strip it down and stuff it into his autonomous driving training cluster. He wants his tin cans to learn how to stop at red lights.""

""**Sacrilege!**"" Enki was frantic. He spun around, projecting the architecture diagram Ning had deduced onto the screen in front of Gibil.

""Look at this, Gibil!"" Enki pointed at the complex connections of the Attention Mechanism. ""Enlil only wants to build a **Driver**, but we... **we want to build a Brain!**""

""This architecture is called **Transformer**. It doesn't care about traffic lights; it cares about Language, about Logic, about the entire memory of Human Civilization!""

Enki stared into Gibil’s eyes, speaking rapidly:

""This is a bottomless pit. It will devour every chip you create. If we succeed, compute will no longer be a tool; it will be Currency, it will be Oxygen. You will become the Arms Dealer of the New World, Gibil. And Enlil... he's just a taxi driver.""

Gibil fell silent.

His shrewd eyes stared through the black frames at the insane architecture diagram on the screen. As the God of Compute, he smelled the future earlier than anyone else. He understood the potential of parallel computing; he saw the tidal wave this would bring to his graphics card empire.

""Teaching cars to recognize roads..."" Gibil muttered to himself, then glanced at the black obelisk beside him. ""Indeed. Using a Dragon-Slaying Saber to chop vegetables... is too boring.""

Suddenly, Gibil smiled.

It was the rebellious smile of a rock star.

""Nano, right?"" Gibil looked at Nano in the corner. ""Pass me a pen. **A gold one.**""

Nano froze, then frantically rummaged through the nearby workbench until he found a gold paint marker. He handed it to Gibil.

Gibil took the pen, uncapped it, and sniffed the pungent smell of the paint.

He walked up to the priceless black obelisk. Without a shred of hesitation, he waved the pen over the mirror-smooth casing, writing a line in wild cursive:

**""To OpenAbzu""**

Then, below it, he signed his famous, lightning-like signature.

""Tell Enlil there was an error with the logistics information.""

Gibil recapped the pen and tossed it to Enki, then opened his arms like a generous king, slapping the black chassis.

""This nuclear reactor is yours.""

""Take it away. Go light that fire. Let me see what kind of monster my graphics cards can cook up.""

Enki cupped the pen, still warm from Gibil’s hand, trembling with excitement. He looked at Nano, his eyes fanatical.

""Move it! Big guy, quick! Before Enlil reacts, get it back to the Abyss!""

Nano stepped forward. When his hands touched the cold black chassis, he felt a heavy weight.

It wasn't just the weight of a machine.

**It was the weight of the future.**

Behind them, the man in the leather jacket picked up his torque wrench again, humming a tune, and vanished into the white mist of liquid nitrogen and the green halo. He had just completed the greatest venture capital investment in history—**he gave away a shovel, but dug open the tunnel to the Domain of Gods.**",1,1766933708.0,HFY,1,1.0,False

I only play with paper cards with my nephew nowadays, basically old premade decks. These decks are old, these kind of product doesn't exist anymore, now sadly just premade commander decks. Well, not that these cards are expensive but since they are old (old frame and so), I have them all double sleeved with Dragon Shield sealable + normal sleeve, just to protect them from anything on the table like a coffee, juice, cookies, whatever.

I don't like the current direction of Magic, but I bought a Foundations starter + Jumpstart box to make a cube, so we can have something new to play, we need something new. The thing is... I spent 28€ + 85€ = 113€ on these cards, and they aren't something ""old"" that needs to be preserved. These are 200 + 480 cards, so I would need 7 packs of inner and outer sleeves...  7x 6€ DS sealable + 7x10€ DS sleeves = 112€ it is basically the cost of the cards (113€), so I feel like it would be something dumb.

Are you guys double sleeving ""cheap"" products like this? Even single sleeving with Dragon Shield would cost 70€ for 113€ that I paid for the two boxes of cards.... Should I just order 700 sleeves from Temu for 30€ and forget about double sleeving? 😅 Or double sleeve and maybe in 20 years they are still in a good condition...

I spent weeks researching different models, talking to baristas, and testing shots at various shops. The machine I selected could pull consistent espresso shots, steam milk to the perfect microfoam texture, and handle the morning rush without overheating. It was not cheap, nearly a quarter of my startup budget went into it, but three months in, I knew it was worth every penny.

Regular customers started commenting on the quality and consistency. One customer, a coffee importer, mentioned that many international cafes source their equipment through wholesale platforms like Alibaba to get better pricing on commercial-grade machines. My machine runs for eight hours a day, five days a week, and has only needed routine maintenance.

The sound of the grinder and the hiss of the steam wand have become the soundtrack of my daily life. When I see customers close their eyes after that first sip, I know the investment was right.

My thinking is that we screwed up as hosts, not the guests. Was buying them Dunkin’ Donuts coffee overkill? Potentially, but I cater to my guest as though they were incredibly picky.

Salt House

 

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged. 

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

 

Thursday, May 5^(th)   2002.

 

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

 

 

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements. 

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",1,1766933218.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I know it’s kinda late for a first date after that long, but honestly, it was because I was scared. Low confidence, low courage, overthinking everything, and worrying that I might not be able to pull it off. Basically… yeah, I was scared 😅

That said, I always felt like we had great chemistry. Anyway, here’s the main part.

I finally built up the courage to ask her out without thinking too much. I just went for it, set aside my fears, and took the risk. By the grace of God, she said yes. I even set the place and time like I actually knew what I was doing (first time asking a girl out, by the way). It came out surprisingly natural—probably because I imagined this scenario way too many times lol.

So here’s what happened: I picked her up at her place and drove to the coffee shop I planned. We ordered some drinks and snacks, and I initiated the conversation. We ended up talking for almost 3 hours straight. No phones, no distractions—we talked so much that we completely lost track of time. We went in around 7:00 and didn’t leave until 9:30, mainly because the shop was closing at 9:45. We even had to pack up our food and iced coffee since we couldn’t finish them because we were too busy talking.

We talked about a lot of things, mostly academic stuff. After that, I drove her home and asked if she enjoyed our time together. She said yes. I followed it up with something like, “Care to do it again?” She said she’s kinda busy right now since they’re preparing for New Year’s. I clarified that I didn’t mean immediately—just when we’re both free. She said, “Sure, just say when.”

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged. 

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

 

Thursday, May 5^(th)   2002.

 

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

 

 

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements. 

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",1,1766933167.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1pxsz33,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pxsz33/obsessed_with_the_thought_that_i_have_no_friends/,obsessed with the thought that I have no friends,"Well, I actually do have friends, but I don’t really talk to anyone anymore.

For context, I’m 23 and I’ve been living with my boyfriend for 3 years. We always hang out together and do everything together, so that totally held me back from socializing with other people. He has friends and friend groups because he’s friendly and, tbh, a very chill guy, so he makes friends easily. Me, on the other hand, I struggle from obsessively reminding myself every day that I don’t have real friends.

I had a very social high school (and even middle school) life. I was always surrounded by friends and friend groups that only exist in movies, but I lost them all. We had minor arguments, or honestly I don’t even remember, but I lost them and it’s been so long. The point is, I’ve always felt the need for a friend group because of those early experiences. But that just didn’t happen, and now I’m left with almost no one in my life.

Apart from my boyfriend, who’s been my everything for many years, I have maybe four people I could call if something happened to me. And it’s sad and hard to write because I doubt they’d even respond immediately.

I recently graduated uni as well, so I have no reason and no place to meet or chat with anyone anymore. Also, I was never the type of person who texts or calls people. I use Instagram, so I expect everyone else to post their lives too, and I’ll find out what they’re up to that way but never directly asking like “hey bro, how’s it going.”

At school, I would occasionally meet friends one-on-one. One-on-one isn’t really my thing; I’d much rather be around a friend group, but I literally had no choice. It doesn’t make sense to constantly meet one-on-one if you’re not besties, it just gets weird and forced after a while, in my opinion. Idk, that’s been my experience.

But again, it’s true that I’m obsessed with friend groups. I’m not a jealous person at all, but when I see someone with a genuinely cool friend group, I get so jealous and almost heartbroken. The closest thing I have to that now is one inactive group chat.

At uni, I did hang out around a “friend group,” but only because my best friend at the time (before we disconnected due to an argument while traveling abroad, so we failed the ultimate friendship test lol) already knew those people. I really disliked them. They were competitive, heterosexual computer science LinkedIn boys. The other friend group I had was better since it was all girls, but they kept having separate group chats without some of us and doing things like that. Plus, I never really established any deep relationships with them. We just grabbed coffee after classes sometimes.

Honestly, I knew I wanted something else. I wanted people like me. People who actually live like uni students and, idk, grab beers, go partying? It sounds childish, but I was trying to fit into a conservative girls’ friend group while desperately wanting stimulation. Basically, I was unhappy with the lack of people who shared my interests.

Every person I interacted with felt like a forced friendship or just didn’t click. I met people through student clubs, classes, etc., but nothing really came out of it. And tbh, everyone already has friends :D and not everyone is open to meeting more.

On top of that, I get judged so easily. Throughout my life I’ve always been kind of misjudged, and I thought once people got to know me it would pass. For some people, yeah, but mostly I’m treated weirdly. For example, an acquaintance once said in front of everyone, “Yeah, we definitely look weird, especially with her (me) with us,” talking about how we’d attract too much attention while walking through a sketchy neighborhood. I wasn’t even overdressed or anything,I was just being me. But I have piercings and the hair and it’s just… it fucking sucks to stand out sometimes, especially when you live in a country that doesn’t really understand that people can express themselves. (I dress emo/scene and live in Turkey, unfortunately.)

I seriously don’t think I’m a good or bad person. I make stupid mistakes, I upset people out of anger or misunderstandings. I gossip occasionally. I admit I’m not a fucking angel, but I would never let anyone bully someone else, for example, and I can’t tolerate being mean for no reason. I’m just a regular human being with no bad intentions.

Anyway, I know there are people out there who feel similar to me, but believe me it’s not that easy, even for me, when it should be relatively easy since I’m a woman and act extroverted. People say it just gets harder and harder as you age.

So I guess this is it. No one is coming to my wedding.",1,1766933099.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Salt House

 

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged. 

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

 

Thursday, May 5^(th)   2002.

 

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

 

 

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements. 

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",2,1766933072.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

Salt the well and never go

 

Monday, May 2^(nd) 2002.

 

I am not really sure how to start this, so I guess I will just start. They told me to keep a journal of everything I see out here so I can better report any strange activity. Whatever that means.

My name is Simon Hutchinson. Most people call me Hutch, a nickname I picked up in school, but Simon is fine too. I am twenty five years old and, if I am being honest, something of a professional dropout. For the last few years I have bounced between odd jobs, just enough to get by, never staying anywhere long enough to feel settled.

I wanted to be a firefighter. I enrolled in the academy and I truly believed I had found something that mattered. I liked the idea of helping people, of belonging to a crew and being useful in a way that meant something. I thought I could handle it.

What I did not know was that I was claustrophobic.

The fear had been completely dormant my entire life. Elevators never bothered me. Closets were fine. Crowded rooms were annoying but manageable. It was not until the day I put on a self contained breathing apparatus that I learned how wrong I was. The moment the mask sealed against my face, panic crept in. When I connected the regulator, it surged. 

There was a brief moment, maybe a second at most, between the regulator touching the mask and the air flowing. In that second, all the oxygen was gone. My chest locked up. A dread hit me so hard and so suddenly that it felt physical, like something pressing down on me from the inside. I ripped the mask off, gasping and shaking.

It sounds ridiculous when I describe it now. A mask. A tank full of air. Nothing actually wrong. But fear isn’t rational. It does not care about logic or training or how badly you want something. After a short panic attack and an embarrassing discussion with some of the training staff, I dropped out of the academy.

It was the same way I dropped out of college. The same way I dropped out of high school. I left without ceremony, just a quite exit.

I still want to help people, and maybe someday I will find whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. But until then I need money, and I guess that is how I ended up here.

I responded to an ad that had been circled in a newspaper at a coffee shop. I did not circle it myself. I picked the paper up off a small round table by the window and saw that a few words had been marked with a thick red highlighter, the circle uneven and heavy handed. Whoever did it probably should not have, because I would never have noticed the listing otherwise. The whole thing felt oddly deliberate, like I was meant to see it, like the paper had been waiting for me to pick it up.

The ad read “Land Holdings Monitoring Needed.” I did not know what that meant. I still don’t, not really. The description underneath was vague but straightforward enough. Maintain a secure perimeter around a future development site. Walk the fence line. Observe and report any vehicle or foot traffic. Make sure anyone attempting to enter the property was authorized to be there.

I asked the coffee shop owner if he knew the address. He wiped his hands on a rag and nodded before I even finished the question. He said it was a couple hundred acres of woods, maybe more, though he was not sure exactly how much belonged to the company posting the ad. He called it a future development site and smirked a little when he said it.

They have been saying that for years, he told me. Never going to happen.

None of it really interested me. The land, the company, the idea of something that might exist someday but did not yet. What mattered was the pay. Eight dollars an hour. For someone like me who would have taken minimum wage without a second thought, it felt like more than fair. Enough to justify making the call at least.

So I asked the shop owner if I could use his phone. He shook his head without looking up and pointed toward a payphone in the corner of the room, half hidden behind a rack of postcards and outdated flyers. I fed it a few coins and dialed the number from the newspaper, fully expecting an automated menu or some prerecorded pitch about land investments and future opportunities.

Instead someone picked up immediately.

“Hello.”

I stumbled through my introduction, explaining that I was calling about the job posting. While I talked I tried to rehearse answers in my head, figuring out how I would explain my lack of experience, how I would dance around the fact that I had never held a job for more than a few months at a time. None of that mattered. He never asked.

His name was Murph. At least that is what he told me. I assumed it was short for Murphy, but he never clarified and I didn’t ask. His voice was calm and friendly, almost casual, like we had spoken before. He asked if I was local. I told him no. He asked if I knew where the site was. I said I did, which was only half true. He seemed satisfied with that.

“Can you meet me at the address on Monday at five,” he asked.

“I can make that work,” I said, surprised at how easily the words came out.

“Great,” he replied. “See you then.”

The line went dead and just like that I had an interview.

I arrived Monday at five on the dot. I made a conscious effort to hide the fact that I had been sleeping in my car. I drove a 1981 Ford Escort, which does not offer many places to conceal sleeping bags or spare clothes, but I figured he would not be inspecting my vehicle too closely. I was right.

Murph was just as friendly in person. He was older, short and stocky, with a white beard and a thin white ponytail pulled through the back of a faded baseball cap. He gave off a slightly eccentric energy, the kind of guy you would expect to run a bait shop or sell handmade furniture or candles or something. It struck me as odd that he was representing a company whose long term plans involved leveling the woods around us.

We were parked in a wide dirt turnout just off the road. Murph’s truck was much newer than my Escort, but still unremarkable. No logos. No decals. Nothing to indicate who he worked for. After a few pleasantries he walked over to a tall chain link gate that cut across a gravel drive disappearing into the trees. He fumbled with a large ring of keys, muttering to himself, before finally finding the right one. The padlock came loose with a dull metallic clank. He pulled the chain aside and swung the gate open.

He drove through and I followed him in my car. He had mentioned that he was taking me to “Headquarters”.

We drove for about five minutes. The woods out here were thick. Dense enough that even though it was still early evening, the light felt wrong. Muted. The trees pressed in close on both sides of the road, their branches knitting together overhead. Five o’clock inside that forest felt more like dusk.

We eventually stopped beside a small shed set back from the road. It was maybe ten feet by twenty, neatly built, sitting alone in a small clearing. I got out of the car and followed Murph, half expecting him to start unloading tools or open it to reveal lawn equipment or storage bins. For a moment I almost laughed to myself at the idea of this being headquarters.

I am glad I did not.

Murph turned to me, clearly proud, and gestured toward the shed as if unveiling something important.

“Welcome,” he said. “This is it.”

Headquarters.

HQ sat just off the narrow dirt road like it had grown there rather than been built. The shed was old, no question about that, but not in a way that made it feel unsafe. The wood siding had faded to a dull gray and the corners were soft with age, but the structure itself was straight. No sagging roof, no broken windows. Someone had cared about it at some point and apparently still did, at least enough to keep it standing. A single light fixture hung above the door, the kind you would expect on a back porch, and a conduit ran up the exterior wall carrying power inside. That small detail made it feel more permanent than I expected.

Inside, the space was laid out with surprising intention. A long table stretched from one wall to the other, sturdy and scarred from years of use. Above it was a single window that faced away from the road we had come in on, looking out into what I assumed was just trees. The glass was clean, clearer than I would have expected, and it let in a muted green light filtered through the canopy outside.

There were two chairs at the table. One was a rolling office chair and the other was an old wooden chair, the kind you would find at a kitchen table in a house that had not been updated since the seventies. The contrast between the two bothered me.

On the table sat a radio unit, older but well maintained, its dials worn smooth and it had a small talking device attached by a tangled mess of a cable. Next to it were two walkie talkies sitting upright in their charging docks, small red lights glowing steadily. Pens and loose paper were scattered near the center of the table, along with a fancy light leather journal which I’m currently writing in and some other binders and books.

Against the far wall was a small sofa facing a television that looked even older than the rest of the equipment. A VCR sat balanced on top of it, slightly crooked, with a stack of unlabeled tapes beside it. All of them are completely unlabeled, some of them look like they had labels on at one point that were scratched off. I remember thinking it was strange but I didn’t ask any questions.

Murph explained the rules of the position, pointing to a logbook on the table. “You’ll need to walk the fence perimeter when you arrive and before you leave,” he said, his voice matter-of-fact but warm. “If anyone comes to the gate, log their info here.” He tapped the open logbook.

I frowned. “How will I even know if someone shows up?”

Murph smiled and pointed to a red button mounted on the wall. “There’s a buzzer and microphone at the gate. When someone hits the buzzer, press this button. That’ll let you talk to them. Shouldn’t be too many visitors, though. Pretty easy gig.”

He paused and looked at me expectantly. “Any questions so far?”

“Yes,” I said. “Who’s on the other end of the walkie-talkies?”

Murph tilted his head, puzzled for a moment. “Oh, no one. They’re just for you and me or for any guests who might show up and you think it’s a good idea for them to have while their onsite. They won’t pick up any other communications.”

He led me back outside, the wind rustling the tall grass around the shed. “One more thing you’ll need to know,” he said, lowering his voice slightly, as if what he was about to reveal was more important than the fence or the logbook.

“There’s a house in the trees over there,” Murph said, pointing toward the direction the window faced. It almost felt like the window had been intentionally positioned to look directly at the structure. “It’s an old house, but still completely functional. Nothing fancy just a house and a garage. It’s empty, but it has electricity, a septic tank, and a well, so we’re worried about squatters.”

He gave me a knowing look. “I checked it out myself a couple of days ago. No need for you to go inside, but if you ever see lights or any signs of life, make sure to let me know.”

Murph walked over to his truck and retrieved a black jacket with the word *SECURITY* emblazoned across the back. He handed it to me, and as I took it, he confirmed my hours: Monday through Friday, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

It suddenly hit me, this wasn’t an interview. This was my first day on the job. The realization might have unsettled someone else, but the job seemed comfortable enough, so I simply nodded and put on the jacket.

“You’ll be paid every other week,” he said finally. “Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. And remember to detail any interactions or anything odd so you can accurately report any strange activity.”

With that, he climbed into his truck and drove off, leaving me alone in the quiet of the woods.

And just like that, I was on my own. I had applied for this job on Saturday, and two days later, I was standing at headquarters, tasked with patrolling a property that I did not know. Murph had already walked the fence earlier that day, so I wouldn’t have to walk them again until the morning. Maybe ill watch some of those tapes or maybe ill see if I can get some sleep on that sofa, I know I probably shouldn’t write that in this journal but Murph said that the journal is mine and writing was something that I could do to pass time. The journal wouldn’t be read by anybody but me but he again reinforced that I should keep notes daily to help me should any questions come my way.

 

Tuesday, May 3^(rd)  2002.

 

Close call yesterday. After Murph left, I grabbed my sleeping bag from my car. I was just going to lay down on the sofa for twenty minutes or so, but after weeks of sleeping in my car, I was a lot more exhausted than I realized. The next thing I knew, the buzzer went off at 5:50 a.m. It was Murph.

I hit the button and spoke into the microphone attached to the radio. He said he was driving by but didn’t have time to unlock the fence and drive up to headquarters, thank God. He just wanted to quickly check in. I told him it had been uneventful, which, to be fair, was true. He asked when I had done my walk around, and unfortunately, I lied. I told him I had done it a few hours ago. I have no idea how long the fence is, but saying a few hours sounded right. I just hoped he wouldn’t ask how long it had taken, and luckily, he didn’t. I feel guilty lying to Murph and I wont be making a habit of it.

Anyway, it is currently 6:30 p.m. I just got back to headquarters after doing laundry at a local laundromat and buying food. Money is getting low, and I don’t get paid for another two weeks, so I have to make it stretch. Anyway I’m going to go and walk the fence line, will check back if I see anything fun.

I’m not exactly sure how long the fence is. It took me about forty-five minutes to walk from headquarters, following the perimeter through the woods, back toward the main road and the gate, and then returning to HQ. The land is heavily wooded but fairly flat, maybe about two miles in total. Definitely a large piece of property.

The house is creepy. There’s nothing overtly frightening about it, but it feels so out of place. There’s no road that leads up to it, no driveway, nothing. It’s a long, rectangular house, and the garage makes it an L shape. The bottom of the garage door is slightly lifted, which is probably something I should report. I have no idea who would build a house way out here with no way to access it. What’s the point of a garage if no car can drive out of it? Maybe it’s some kind of mannequin house, a mock-up the developer uses to show what’s to come.

It started to get really dark once I got back to HQ, and honestly, I’m a bit nervous about the morning check. I’m also pretty nervous about the fact that I don’t have a cell phone. Murph gave me his card and told me to call if I had questions or if something happened, but the only devices here that can contact the outside world are two walkie-talkies that only communicate with each other and a CB radio that can only reach whoever is at the gate. He probably just assumed that I did have a cell phone, I think I’m going to buy a cheap one when I get my first paycheck.

I went over some administrative details with Murph this morning that I suppose are worth writing down. It sounds like the last person who worked this job only lasted a couple of weeks before the schedule became too much for him. He still works here though, covering the weekend shifts, and will be the one who relieves me on Fridays. All I know is that his name is John. Murph mentioned it in passing, and when I asked for his last name he sort of talked over me. I did not press the issue. I figured I might need it in case he tried to enter during the week for some reason, but I guess I can always just let anyone named John through the gate if it comes to that.

It is 2:30 in the morning and there is a light on at the house. I can see it clearly through the window in front of me right now. The only reason I am writing is to keep myself calm. This place is strange. Like I said before, I keep telling myself it is probably just a show house or something similar, maybe the wiring is faulty or on some kind of timer. Still, I do not know what I am supposed to do. Am I expected to go out there and check on it.

So I went out there. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped outside, telling myself that if I was going to write reports about strange activity then I probably needed to actually investigate it when it happened. The woods feel tight at night, like the darkness makes everything feel so much closer to you. As I got closer to the house I could hear voices, low and muffled, and that alone was enough to make my stomach drop. I stayed back near the tree line and kept the light off, just watching. It didn’t take long to realize they were just kids, teenagers, I think they were daring each other to go into the house. I didn’t feel relieved so much as annoyed and embarrassed by how scared I had been. I stepped out far enough for them to see the beam of my flashlight sweep across the house and shouted that the property was monitored and that they needed to leave. My voice cracked. They bolted immediately and I was left standing Infront of the house. The more time I spend near it the more it gets to me. Its like a giant dollhouse in the woods, I literally cant imagine anything creepier.  I left the light on, I’m gonna wait until the sun is at least rising before I step into that place.

 

Wednesday, May 4^(th)   2002.

 

I have a lot to write down already and I only just got to work! When I left at 6am this morning Murph was waiting at the gate. I assume he was checking up on me to make sure I was not skipping shifts or anything like that. I told him about the kids I saw near the house and he became visibly stressed almost immediately. Without saying much he turned us around and told me to follow him back to HQ. I asked what the problem was but he did not really answer.

We drove straight past HQ and toward the house, which made me uneasy because the light was still on. I thought for sure he was going to scold me for not reporting it sooner but he did not mention it at all. Instead he parked near the side of the house and walked toward a small shed I had not really noticed before. When he opened it I it was completely filled, literally top to bottom, with bags of salt. The kind you use to keep driveways clear in the winter.

That was when he pointed out something else I had somehow missed. There was a large ring of salt surrounding the entire house. Murph pulled out a pocket knife, cut open one of the bags, and began carefully pouring salt back into the ring. I followed him as he worked. The grass and plants where the salt touched the ground were dry and brittle, almost dead.

I asked him what we were doing and he told me it keeps animals out of the house. I wanted to say “what, like snails?” but I could tell he was already upset, so I kept quiet. About halfway around the house we came to a section where the salt had been disturbed. There was a wide gap where it looked like someone had kicked it away. Murph went over that spot several times, making sure it was completely filled in.

When he finished he threw the empty bag into the back of his truck and told me that if I ever saw those teenagers at the house again I needed to salt it immediately. He looked genuinely concerned when he said this. I agreed without hesitation. And honestly, that was not even the strangest thing that has happened today.

I went to the coffee shop around 4 pm after basically sleeping all day. It was empty except for the owner. I was still wearing my security jacket and he noticed it immediately. He nodded toward it and said, “Got the job at Salt House then, did you?” I asked him how he had heard about what happened last night, but he told me he had not heard about anything. Apparently the place itself is some kind of well known urban legend around here and everyone just refers to it as Salt House. That alone made my stomach drop. The coffee shop owner seemed surprised that I had not heard of the legend and agreed to tell me about it. I took notes of what he said on the back of a postcard, which he found amusing. below is everything he told me.

Sometime in the early 1700s there was a woman who arrived in town alone. No family followed her and no one seemed to know where she came from. She was apparently wealthy and it showed, she purchased multiple properties in and around the settlement. Not long after that she began selling goods to the townspeople at prices far lower than anyone was used to. Boots and belts. Satchels and book bindings. The material she used was something she claimed to have developed herself. She called it silk leather.

It was softer than traditional leather and stronger too. It did not crack in the cold and it did not rot when wet. Most importantly it was cheap. Within months nearly everyone in town owned something made from it. Men wore trousers of silk leather. Women carried books bound in it. Children ran through the streets in silk leather shoes and even the dogs wore matching silk leather collars. The goods brought visitors from neighboring towns and trade increased. The local economy flourished and the woman was praised. People thought the women was a blessing.

But unfortunately a darkness fell over the area. It was around this time that people began to notice how quiet the surrounding villages had become.

Travelers spoke of empty homes and unanswered doors. Livestock wandered untended. Sheriffs and local leaders began comparing census records and missing persons reports. When the numbers were finally tallied they believed more than one hundred people had vanished over several years. Although the town loved the women she was not above accusation. 100 missing people resulted in door to door inspections and interrogations.

She owned a barn on one of her properties where she worked alone. One day a group of townspeople entered the barn as part of their efforts to determine the source of their missing townsfolk. The barn was filled with skin. Human skin. Hung from rafters and stretched across frames. Treated and tanned and prepared like any other hide. According to the coffee shop owner some of the documents from that time describe pieces that were whole. Entire skins removed cleanly. As if she had figured out how to peel a person and leave nothing behind but an empty skin puppet.

There was no trial.

She was hanged first but after fifteen minutes her body was cut down. When that did not end her life they burned her. When the fire died down and the black smoke cleared her body was no longer recognizable as human but it was still moving. Still screaming. A wretched burnt creature howling in pain. The townspeople carried what remained of her to an abandoned well that had dried up years earlier. They bound her and threw her inside.

Under the guidance of a respected priest the well was surrounded with salt. Not just a ring but a barrier. Records say the town employed men whose only task was to replenish it regularly. Week after week. Year after year.

The coffee shop owner laughed when he finished telling me this.

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it” he said and his eyebrows raised.

I asked him if he actually believed the story. He laughed softly and smiled again, said it was just an old wives tale, the kind of thing that spreads around campfires. Then I asked him if he would ever go out to Salt House. The smile vanished immediately. He did not laugh this time. He did not hesitate either. He just looked at me for a long moment and said that he would not.

 

Thursday, May 5^(th)   2002.

 

After writing out the story the coffee shop owner told me yesterday, I did not really feel like writing any more. Honestly, just looking at this journal made me uneasy. It has a light leather binding, and I cannot stop thinking about the silk leather story.

To take my mind off things, I went through a few of the old tapes last night. I was hoping to find something light, maybe a comedy or at least something distracting, but they were all related to the town. The first tape I put in looked like a short tourism advertisement. Smiling people walking downtown, shots of the river, cheerful music. It only lasted a couple of minutes. The second tape was a presentation explaining the proposed development of this land. It talked about mixed use buildings, apartments over storefronts, economic growth, community benefits. I only watched those two. I have a feeling the rest are more of the same.

When I left this morning at 6am, Murph was waiting for me again at the gate. I told him about my conversation with the coffee shop owner and asked him why he had not mentioned any of it to me. He sighed and said it was nonsense, just a local legend that kids tell to freak each other out. He said that the fact I was not from here was actually a benefit. According to him, the locals tend to take these stories seriously, and he thought it was better that I was not superstitious.

Still, he apologized. He said he could understand how learning about it after accepting the job would be unsettling, but insisted he never planned to hide the story from me forever. He explained that some locals think it is funny to sneak onto the property and kick away the salt line around the house. Teenagers, mostly. They treat it like a rite of passage, daring each other to break the circle like it will somehow unleash some curse upon the town.

I asked him again why we salt the house. He stuck to the same explanation, saying it was purely practical. A vacant house sitting in dense wilderness attracts insects, animals, and all kinds of infestations. Over the years, they tried different chemicals to preserve the structure, but salt worked best. He confirmed what I had suspected about the house being a demonstration build. Back when the development was considered a sure thing and the company thought the project would move quickly they built it to show off some features that would be available for people who wanted to move in. They assumed the town would welcome new housing district but they underestimated how fiercely people here defend the local wilderness. Murph said he respected that about them.

The project was delayed so many times that now no one is sure where it stands. The salt around the house and the salt around the well, he said, were just an unfortunate coincidence. But once word spread about a large salt circle, people immediately tied it back to the old story of the “Silk Leather Witch”. That was the first time I heard the name Silk Leather Witch. Even knowing it was supposed to be a joke, the name alone sent a chill through me. Unfortunately for the company the locals embraced the story, and now this property is woven into the legend as much as the woman herself.

By the time Murph left, I felt calmer. His explanation made sense, and he apologized again for not being more upfront. I thanked him and watched his truck disappear down the road.

It is 7pm now. My mind tells me there is no witch in that house. I understand the logic, the history, the exaggeration. But fear is not rational. The light in the house is now flickering, the glow faintly pulsing through the trees, and there is simply no way I am going over there to turn it off.

I thought I was done writing for the night but unfortunately that was not the case. At around 4am I heard three loud bangs in the distance. It sounded like knocking, dull and hollow, coming from the direction of the house. I sat frozen for a long moment, telling myself it was just kids again, that it had to be kids, but my body did not believe that explanation. Eventually I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the house, moving slowly and quietly, hoping I would see a group of teenagers I could scare off so this could all be over quickly.

There was no one there.

The lights inside the house were still on, still flickering gently. I walked the perimeter carefully, keeping my eyes low and away from the windows because I was genuinely afraid of what I might see reflected back at me. The woods felt wrong in a way that is hard to describe, like they were holding their breath. I had a strange sense of anticipation. I found no footprints, no voices, no movement, but I did find the salt circle broken again. A wide gap where the line should have been, as if something had deliberately stepped through it.

As we agreed, I went to the small shed and pulled out a new bag of salt. I started at the broken section, pouring slowly and deliberately, going back and forth to make sure the line was solid and unbroken. I moved clockwise around the house, my flashlight beam shaking with each step, listening to every sound the woods offered me.

When I returned to where I started, something new was there.

A small piece of parchment paper was sticking out of the fresh salt pile, tied with a thin leather bow. I know for a fact it had not been there moments earlier. I did not read it. I did not stop to think. I pulled it free, shoved it into my pocket, and fast walked back toward HQ with the empty salt bag still in my hand.

The silence was overwhelming. Every step I took sounded amplified, every leaf crunching beneath my boots echoing through the darkness. By the time I reached HQ my hands were shaking. I locked the door behind me and sat at the table before finally unfolding the paper.

There was a poem written on it.

 

She stitched the town in leather fine  
Boot and belt and book to bind  
Soft as silk and cheap to buy  
No one asked the reason why

When folk went missing one by one  
She smiled still and sold for fun  
Hung and burned and thrown below  
Salt the well and never go

 

 

 

 

Friday, May 6^(th)   2002.

 

I had a nightmare after I left this morning, the first one I have had in a very long time. It felt different from a normal dream, heavier somehow, like my body never fully let go of it when I woke up.

In the dream I cannot move and I cannot see. Everything is black. I can smell something damp and rotten, like mold soaked into old wood. The smell is so strong it burns the back of my throat. I am in an incredible amount of pain. Not a sharp pain but a deep grinding one, the kind that feels structural, like my body is being held together wrong. Every attempt to move feels like bones cracking and skin tearing.

The claustrophobia hits me almost immediately. Even in the dream I recognize it and panic sets in fast. Breathing becomes difficult, shallow and tight, like my chest is wrapped in something that will not give. I start pushing in every direction I can think of. I realize that I am standing upright, completely vertical, but I am almost entirely immobilized. Something solid presses against me from all sides. I cannot feel open air anywhere on my body.

Then I look up.

Above me is the moon. It is the only thing I can see. It hangs directly overhead, round and yellow, enormous, taking up nearly a third of the sky. The sight of it calms me in a way that makes no sense. The panic eases just a little. At least I am outside, I think. At least there is sky.

I stare at the moon and after a moment it begins to flicker. Not violently, just faintly. On and off. On and off. Then something passes in front of it.

A face.

It is my face.

It floats there in front of the moon, pale and wrong, frozen in an expression of pure terror. My eyes are wide and glossy and I am certain there are tears pooled along the lower lids. There is no sound at all. Less than silence. No wind. No breath. No movement except the faint flicker of the moon behind my own face. At first my brain tells me that my face is a reflection but it cant be, it moves independently of my movements. 

The face vanishes.

There is a soft pop, like a balloon bursting somewhere far away and a small noise like ashes being scattered onto the ground.

Suddenly sound rushes back into the world. I can hear everything. The scrape and echo of my own movements. Wet dragging noises. Small involuntary groans escaping my throat. I realize the sounds are coming from me.

The face appears again in front of the moon.

This time it speaks.

It says one word.

“John?”

The face surges toward me impossibly fast, like I am being launched straight into it. The last thing I see is my own face twisted in pain and fear, mouth open in a silent scream, eyes begging.

Then I woke up.

I have never felt relief like that in my life. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, curled in the back of my car. My chest hurt. My hands were shaking. For the first time in a long time I was genuinely grateful to be awake, grateful to be cramped and uncomfortable and breathing freely.

Whatever that dream was, it did not feel imagined. It felt remembered. This place is doing things to me that I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand. The next time I see Murph I am going to tell him that I cannot continue working here. Hopefully he will pay me for the week.

The time is 8:30 pm. I had just finished my walk around the property. Everything seemed quiet. The salt circle was intact and the lights in the house were still flickering on and off. They were dim enough now that I could almost ignore them from HQ. My plan had been to pretend they were not flickering at all and wait for the bulbs to burn out on their own. I was never going to enter the house. Unfortunately it does not seem like that is an option anymore.

When I returned to HQ I noticed immediately that one of the walkie talkies was missing. My stomach dropped. For a moment I thought Murph might be here, but then I remembered John works the weekends. Maybe his hours overlap with mine. Maybe this is just how the shift change works and Murph never bothered to explain it to me.

I picked up the remaining walkie talkie and held the button down. I said hello. After about ten seconds I heard a hello come back to me, almost identical to the way I had said it. Same tone. Same hesitation.

I asked who it was. There was no response.

John I asked.

After another long pause the voice came back. Yes this is John. You must be Hutch.

I told him that I was and asked if he was doing a fence walk. I said I had just finished one and that he could come back to HQ. He told me he could not. He said he needed help. He told me that he was stuck but his voice remained calm.

I asked him where he was stuck. I told him I could come help if he had slipped or gotten caught in a swampy area or something like that. He told me he was not outside.

He said he was in the house.

I felt my chest tighten. I asked him why he went inside. I know I am new but I understood immediately that this meant I would have to enter the place I had been avoiding since my first night. He told me it was part of his routine. That he always checks it. That he was in the basement and needed me to come get him.

He said he had fallen down the stairs.

I asked if he was hurt. He said yes but not badly. He said I needed to meet him in the basement and help him out so we could both leave. His voice never wavered. He did not sound scared. He did not sound in pain.

I thought about leaving. About driving to a payphone and calling Murph or emergency services or anyone at all. But it could be hours before someone got here. I do not know John but I cannot leave someone injured and alone in the woods. That just is not who I am.

So I am heading up to the house now. I am going to bring John back to HQ and then I am done with this job. Today will be my last day here.

I will document what I see inside the house and John’s condition before I leave.

Ill try and take note of everything I see and I promise I will write everything down when I get back. Wish me luck.",1,1766933009.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

I put my jacket over the chair and my coffee on the table, then got lost in emails for like an hour.

Then this guy comes over and sits down at my table. Just… plops down. I froze for a second, like, did he not see me? I didn’t say anything at first. He starts spreading out his stuff—papers, a huge backpack, half his lunch. Honestly, I was kind of shocked. He didn’t even ask. I tried giving him a look, and he smiled nervously, muttering something about needing a place to sit.

I was pissed, really. My corner, my space. I got up, thinking maybe I’d move, but then part of me wanted to say something. He starts talking loudly on the phone, completely ignoring me. People around are glancing over, clearly annoyed too. My heart’s racing, and I’m just thinking, “Do I tell him to move, or do I just leave and not make a scene?”

I end up saying something, trying to be calm but firm, and he finally shrugs and grabs his stuff. But I can’t shake the frustration, like why does my personal space even feel up for grabs? I keep thinking maybe I overreacted. Maybe he really just needed a seat. But it still feels… disrespectful.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

“You saw the drone footage. There was no time to react, and we got through the interaction without anyone dying!” Tracy’s dumbass lover defended himself, holding his hands up in front of himself.

The technician angrily scrubbed her eyes from the hour she spent glued to the monitors. She had rushed out of the cold to meet him, braving the freezing winds in a moment of worried frustration.

“You could have stopped and talked with me or prepared something for the paladin!” she scolded, grabbing onto his exoskeleton’s neck armor. “You didn’t see how fucking close that hammer was to your skull! You’d better thank every god on this planet that Shar’s in one piece, too!”

He softly laid his palms on her sides, lowering the heat of her exasperation. “How were we meant to know her weapons were infused with artifacts?”

“Yeah… Okay, but still! I mean, you didn’t even answer the radio for like an hour! What the hell was up with that, dude!” Tracy continued, pulling him closer. She looked around his armor to see the very people who tried to kill him. “And what about the other Malkrin? Why the hell are we taking actual prisoners?”

Harrison glanced to the side at the others as they walked past them. The hammer-wielding paladin-bitch was in a female-sized stretcher when she should’ve been in a casket, somehow still breathing after taking several fifty-caliber rounds to the upper body. The spears stood on the sides as both rope-restrained and free Malkrin walked into the fortress settlement.

The engineer took her arm and led her away from the convoy of terrified new arrivals, shameful prisoners, and stalwart Sharkrin spears—all already scanned for infection and cleared, just in case. 

His voice lowered, finally matching her worry. “Look, I was talking with Shar and the other girls interrogated some of Kegara’s troops. We could have just sent them back and face the freezing cold wilderness, without their paladin’s fire artifact that they lived and died by. Or…”

He took a slow breath, taking off his helmet. His hair was sweaty, and his strained eyes bored into her with an air of grave sincerity. He tilted his head in an offer. “…We could keep them here, be nice, and wait to see if the bitch on the stretcher can be fixed up. We’ll show them a little of how we operate and maybe some will stay. The ones who decide to leave won’t have many negative things to say. We’ll let them tell the others they were treated kindly and sent back with as few scratches as possible. That’s a hell of a lot better than rumors spread by terrified knights, doncha think?”

Tracy gave him a difficult look, unsure of how to respond. She could see the vision, but… “How the fuck are we gonna feed, house, and ‘fix up’ FIFTY MORE MALKRIN!? TWO-FIFTHS OF THEM AREN’T EVEN GOING TO WORK! We don’t have a prison. We don’t have housing! Dude!”

The technician threw her arm out wide toward the massive, muscled aliens marching along before jabbing a finger into his armored chest with emphasis on each word. “What. Are. We. Going. To. Do? How? With what material? With what construction drones? I’m already nose-deep in the colony network rework, so don’t tell me you expect another fully-completed builder-bot army in time to build a prissy paladin princess prison. There are going to be some *serious* sacrifices and consequences! You of all people should know how much this ass-rails our plans!”

Harrison slid his hand up her arm and around her neck muscles to softly knead them… The fucker knew her weak spots, gently easing her boiling frustration and sending a nice shiver down her spine. Her breathing calmed as he continued in the same, sympathetic voice.

“No, you’re absolutely right, Trace. Things are gonna change real quick. We’ve got over a hundred Malkrin here now. We’ll first move the builder bots from the shipyard and delay the ocean expansion. That’ll net us a little under thirty drones to construct housing overnight for the new workers. As for the prisoners? The injured ones are going to be put in the medical beds on the first floor of dormitory three. Balrog the Angry, Dredth’khee, is going to be tied down while she heals too. The rest of Kegara’s girls will be treated like the new arrivals and given menial jobs and housing last.”

Tracy squinted at him in disbelief. “You’re putting a hell of a lot of trust into literal strangers who wanted you *dead*.”

He shook his head. “They’re beyond terrified. Plus, this gives the strike team more to do than just train; they’ll get to play guard for now. Not to mention that the other workers always have their guns on their person, so it's not like the prisoners would get very far… They’ll keep a good eye on ‘em.”

“And feeding nearly twice the amount of giant, powerlifting-model shark women?”

“Rationing, at first. All the while, we’re going to print out three logistics water-skeeters and get all the new fisherwomen back into the ocean while the other ten builder-bots start on a second hydroponics module,” he answered, pulling out his data pad from his back.

“Fuck’s sake,” she groaned in a slow release of tense emotions, letting her forehead fall into his bulky, armored chest. His metallic arms wrapped around her nicely. “I guess we’ve also built up our dry-room and freezer storage… You’re planning on using our stockpiled material for clothing and whatever else, too, yeah?”

“For now,” he relented.

“But you have plans for some fuckass factory line to make up for what we’re lacking right now?”

“I do.”

Tracy took in a deep sigh and nuzzled her forehead into him further. She was already convinced. “And you’re anticipating that the others will integrate the new ones into our settlement naturally.”

He shrugged, his warm neck massage becoming her lifeline against the frigid sea breeze. “They’re already doing it pretty well. The strike team’s become pretty good at breaking the ice. Heat pads, good food, and proof of safety would be one hell of a sight for me if I were banished like that. Especially with Monbishoppe’s reassurance. The banished *really* want to hear that they weren’t religiously, socially, and physically screwed after a long, freezing boat ride… It’ll be good, Trace. Promise.”

“I believe you… *dork*,” Tracy resigned with a subtle giggle. She pulled her head up and looked up at him. He wasn’t hurt, and he had plans. Things were alright for now.

Her loving dweeb had a way with putting her at ease. That spike of chest-crushing anxiety she had earlier genuinely might’ve been a death sentence for a younger version of her.

But now? She really had someone to lean on for the first time in a long while.

\= = = = =

God dammit, what the hell was Harrison going to do about **FIFTY** Malkrin? He practically scrambled out of the armor suffocating him. A disgusting layer of sweat stuck to his skin and immediately started to itch under the workshop’s stale heat.

He clicked his tongue twice and waited. His heart thumped in rhythm with the machinery all around, pumping a painful stress through his chest—constant, predictable, and never-ending.

*“Creator,”* Vodny answered from behind him, appearing out of nowhere. She had already switched to urban camouflage from her orange, sea-debris-covered ghillie suit prior. Her expression was covered by an obscuring net over her helmet

He spoke quickly. “I need you to keep an eye on all the new ones. Just listen and pick out dissenters. Give me a general vibe of their opinions. I’ll ask the squad leaders too. I also need you to give me updates on Cera and the medics’ progress with Dredth’khee when you get the chance.”

The shadow bowed her head, but disagreed. *“You will be undefended if I leave.”*

“It’s fine,” he assured, unclipping his rig from the upright armor’s exoskeleton. “I’ll be safer with a better feel over the prisoners and new guys.”

The engineer unclasped his big iron’s holster and put it around his waist, bringing a supporting brace over his shoulder. He glanced up as he tied the strap, but Vodny had already disappeared without a sound… Damn, Cera taught her good.

He spent the next few minutes cobbling together a plan for the hydroponics dome at his desk, transferring a few files to his data pad directly. The farmers would appreciate a more visual representation of the extra workload they’d have. Especially on top of needing to train the new ones. It would be arduous, but there was plenty of arduous work to be spread around. Hell, the script-keeper, shop-keeper, and clergy had their work cut out for them, what with classifying all the new ones into work, even the ‘prisoners.’

/- - - - -

The sun was already down by the time Harrison left the workshop. He made his way through the streetlights toward the farmers, prepared for the first of many meetings that night. His thoughts drifted all the while. A worry over non-lethal opinions and rules of engagement resurfaced, but soon changed as he pondered what the hell blue-wood had to do with artifacts.

No matter what he thought of, everything reminded him that there was going to be a lot of work to do. Those ‘sacrifices and consequences’ that Tracy warned him about were beyond real. It would be a burden shared by just about everyone.

At the very least, he would do all he could to take the brunt of it.

He’d already been losing sleep; what would a little more hurt?

\= = = = =

Javelin placed the tray of soup and sweet-glazed fish filets onto the mess hall table, pushing it toward the black-skinned knight.

*“Eat.”*

The ‘imprisoned’ warrior—a mere spearwoman, really—from Kegara’s camp froze, staring at the food as if she were holding her breath. She kept her shoulders broad, but the captain could see her tail anxiously curled underneath the seat. This one’s armor, sword, shield, and spear had been stripped and kept in storage for later… Why the Creator simply did not melt them down, she did not know.

*“The Creator does not wish for you to starve. So eat,”* Javelin ordered, gripping her firearm tighter. If the fool was not going to say ‘Itadakimasu,’ she could at least begin eating.

It took only a moment longer for the fool to comply. She was not the only one to be hesitant. All of Kegara’s troops were… *weak*, so to speak. Of course, there had yet to be any example of their fighting prowess, but their lean forms and half-meek—fearful may be a more apt description—mannerisms felt enough to make an assumption. At least most of them were not completely ignorant, knowing when they were no match for their opponent.

The three spearwomen who followed after the paladin were different, being zealous enough to charge into a wall of shields and machine guns. Several shield-bashing bruises were enough to teach them, however.

Those fanatical few were insignificant when drawing conclusions of the whole. Javelin felt far more confident now than ever. The only worrying danger was how easily the paladin’s hammer went through Shar’khee’s thickened shield.

No matter. Their enemies were not as strong as she once would have assumed. The fearful pup she once was would have never believed such a claim of the revered paladins. With the brilliance and might of the Creator, she need not worry, especially not over those whom he welcomed. The food, warmth, and security of the Sharkrin fortress would win the hearts of any who enter.

The thin-leather-wearing knight in front of her had quickly gone from taking bites of the fish to guzzling the bowl of soup like a deranged drunk. Mid-chug, her eyes met with Javelin’s. She flinched, dropping her meal and spilling what little was left onto her lap. The bowl clattered against the ground, silencing the room further with each recursive ‘*clink*.’

Her wide, petrified eyes stared into her empty, trembling hands, her breath held still. All the captured warriors around went stone-still, glaring with ire and horror at the weak-handed knight. 

A switch flipped in the knight. She slammed her head down into the table and held her arms out in prostration. She begged and pleaded for forgiveness with a thousand apologies, rattling them off faster than Javelin could take in.

The captain stepped back, glancing over at the other spears on guard. They were just as confused as she.

Yet, the prisoner kept rambling. *“I promise on my life I will fish a thousand expeditions to replace my mistake. No food shall ever be wasted again—”*

*“Quiet yourself,”* Javelin interrupted, half annoyed and half bemused. *“Are you asking for another serving? Why must you blather so?”*

*“N-No, I would never be so gluttonous! I assure you, I will never waste again. Forgive my failures!”*

The captain looked the toned yet gaunt warrior up and down, her visage scrunching into an ambivalent expression. *“…I think you should eat another serving. The Creator would blame me if you starved. Do not spill this one either, lest you seek Chef and Akula’s ire.”*

There was not a single word left in the knight, her stunned silence mimicking the rest of the room. The clatter of utensils only continued when Javelin left to get another tray. Kegara’s troops were odd.

She returned and put another bowl down in front of the half-starved female. *“You will most likely receive new clothing, if that is what worries you so. Chief Harrison would not have you walking around in heatless garments.”*

Still, the prisoner kept staring up at Javelin, refusing to do anything else. She looked hesitant and tense as before, but now she was clearly more confused. She softly shook like she was ready to bawl, too. Was this one broken? Should she be brought to the medical floor with Cera?

…Baka. Javelin huffed and walked away, figuring that the fool would figure herself out in time.

*“T…Thank you,”* the knight whispered.

The captain paused, not looking back as she answered amicably. *“You are welcome.”*

She made her way out of the eating area toward a group of spears by the kitchen half-wall border. Most of them stood around with their weapons, making small-talk whilst keeping a subtle eye on the defenseless prisoners. The male medics were currently preoccupied elsewhere, leaving the arduous task of meal preparation to the Chef himself. He was busy portioning individual bowls of stew.

A shieldswoman, one of the newer ones, smugly rested her arm over a taller portion of the counter, smirking down at the male. *“…and I slammed my shield into her snout before she could make it to the Creator and the priest. The fool attempted to stand, but my strength was overwhelming in comparison. A singular push back down ensured Kegara’s warrior gave in.”*

The self-approving female flexed her armored form for the cook, but he was clearly too preoccupied to watch. The male simply nodded in vague interest, half-smiling. *“Indeed. The Creator’s blessings have carried the Sharkrin far. I am grateful you have been so successful as of recent.”*

*“Yes, our training is arduous, but it shows our merit in battle. It has brought my strength to new heights. Yet, I do not believe I would have made it so far without your culinary skills. I look forward to my meals every day, for they are hearty and delicious… However, I cannot help myself from finding another reason to appreciate coming into the meal hall—”*

*“You would be wise to court another male,”* Javelin stated, approaching the group.

The flirting spear’s back straightened in an instant, subtly relaxing once she met the captain’s gaze. *“Whatever do you mean? I am watching the prisoners and filling in our graceful and talented Chef with the details of our battle. Any handsome fillet such as him deserves to hear the greater feats the Sharkrin warriors are capable of.”*

A low sigh left the yellow-skinned female, her eyes rolling. *“You would be better off prostrating yourself in front of Akula herself before you are allowed a single talon on Chef.”*

*“Akula?”* the shieldswoman responded, nodding her head as her first thoughts formed behind her eyes. *“…And only Akula? Surely even a community-less water worshiper would not be so selfish as to doom a male to having a single mate, no?”*

*“She will be his first mate. It would be her decision who he mates with next,”* the captain warned. She let her light machine gun rest by its strap, crossing her arms over her chest. The chef blushed a deeper blue over his pink-skinned snout.

The slighted spear squinted. *“Why is your allegiance set with the fisherwoman, captain?”*

*“Do not accuse me of favoring another squad leader. I am only looking out for your well-being. It would do us no good if our new shieldswoman came into our morning’s ‘arduous training’ missing her lower fins because she could only think about mating with the nearest ‘fillet.’ Discuss your feelings with Akula if you are truly interested in a relationship.”*

A few moments of silence passed, somewhat awkwardly. The shieldswoman was clearly flustered at that point. Javelin was not pleased with being such an ice block, but it was better not to interfere with other relations. Chef even gave her a little nod in appreciation. Still, she came here to speak for a reason, looking over the other females around the counter.

*“With that out of the way, our shift here is nearly over. I am gathering those interested in watching a star-sent war video-play this evening. It was your wish, so I was sure to inform you.”*

A deep orange-skinned anti-tank specialist on the side tilted her head. *“I was under the impression that the idea would be pushed back for another time, given that we will be guards for the foreseeable future.”*

Javelin shook her head, glanced back at the toothless enemy troops eating away behind her. *“Not our half-squad. Shar’khee’s half will be taking over for the evening until everyone is given rooms and proper security is set up for the meal hall.”*

*“Will their half-squad not be upset at missing the video-play?”* the shieldswoman reasonably asked.

The captain shrugged, smirking. *“They will most likely watch with the Creator himself. I know how to operate the video device, so I am free to set up a viewing at any time. Tonight is as good a night as any, especially with our great victory, no?”*

\- - - - -

The eight spears had settled into the ‘living room.’ Some found spots on the cushions of comfortable furniture, depressing the mattresses considerably, while others stood behind it, giddy hands gripping onto the backrest.

Javelin allotted herself the centermost seat, placing the tiny laptop on her lap and putting on her rubber talon tip. The motions of turning on and connecting to the television device took some time to recall, as she much preferred to watch her anime in bed, but it was not as if her squadmates could judge her prowess.

She clicked through the folders, watching the screen ahead of her mimic the one on her thighs. The motions were all too familiar for her, resulting in her nearly opening the *special* one.

*“What are all these scripts, Captain Javelin?”* a ruby-skinned shieldswoman asked from behind.

Javelin shrugged, continuing unimpeded. *“Other folders I downloaded on my laptop.”*

*“Do they also contain video-plays? What do they say?”*

*“Some of them do,”* the yellow-skinned captain answered. She had already made it into the core movie folder, circling her mouse around one of the genre titles in star-sent script. *“This one here is a folder made for star-sent history and is named such.”*

Another spear from her side leaned in. *“Is everything in star-sent script? Will the viewing also be the same?”*

*“The speaking will, but there will be script beneath that for you to read… You have been studying your scripts, correct?”*

*“But of course I have.”*

*“Can we see what is in the history folder?”* the shieldswoman from before requested.

Javelin obliged and opened it, finding… even more folders with their own titles. One stood out amongst the others, being named ‘war.’ Most excellent! She thought she would have to scroll down and parse through the other genres.

No one said anything while the only technologically-literate female humored her curiosity and perused the options. She read through some of the titles, taking a few moments to jog her memory over the complicated letter-combinations of a few. There was one relating to a dark ‘HAWK’ being downed. Another was titled ‘Saving Private… R…Y…A…N…’ whatever that last word was. Curious indeed.

None of them had a preview image like the anime, so she decided to click on one about silent western fronts. Harrison once said something about a great defense that had to deal with snow and eastern fronts some time ago. Perhaps this one would be apt.

*“Which one are you selecting?”* a riflewoman excitedly prodded

A part of the couch shook as a tail wagged and thwacked against it in tune with the hopes of an anti-tank specialist.*“I hope it includes the ‘tank’ machines… Those metal beasts are quite fearsome. I can only imagine how easily they would thrive in war against star-sent enemies.”*

*“We shall see,”* Javelin announced, letting the video player open. She put it into full-screen and booted up the subtitle translation script on the side. *“Could one of you turn the overhead lights off? Star-sent movies are best enjoyed this way.”*

One did as asked, allowing her to finally press the ‘space’ bar and begin the movie. She could feel the energy and excitement in the room through the others’ subtle grins and restlessness, even in the fact of the long day behind them.

The movie began with the calmness of snow and a peculiar green forest. It was not made of lines and colors, the real world filmed… Seldom had she seen these types of video-plays. There was a beast with orange and brown fur, curiously feeding from its mother. Javelin received a few curious gazes from her comrades on the couch, but they continued to watch nonetheless.

A distant rumble trembled through the tranquil forest, accompanied by a familiar rattle she could not place. It continued for a few moments until—

‘*THWOOM*,’ the speakers shook the entire floor with an explosion onscreen. A gash of cold blue snow, black wood, and filthy mud cut through a dark, barren land. The entire screen shook from another discharge as the familiar clatter of gunfire filled in after. Star-sents, dozens or hundreds of them, scurried through the dirtied crevice, shouting and shooting at an unseen enemy—abhorrent perhaps? They lined up on the edges, letting loose with single-shot rifles and belt-fed machine guns, defending admirably despite the conditions.

She felt her heart swell in seeing other star-sents fight *just* like her. Their victory would be hard fought but—

*’Tonk.’*

The soldier fell back into the mud, a hole where his helmet once was.

Javelin’s breath hitched as the other spears gasped. She waited for the warrior to get back to his feet, or receive some explanation, but the movie cared not for him, moving the camera along as another soldier screamed out toward the fallen.

A shiver crawled down the moment she realized it.

The star-sent was dead.

Another’s skull was split on screen mere seconds after, causing a few Malkrin to flinch. Cries and screams blared from the speakers, embodying the wide eyes of terror from beings that looked just like the Creator. They wailed and called out to the fallen as they bled out into pools of mud and ichor.

Then, in a sudden silence, the camera cut. Their bodies were gathered in a lull of battle. Coats were torn as odd star-sent-sized boxes were filled. The jackets were ruined and soaked in blood. They were quickly washed, stitched, and tossed into baskets by a factory of star-sent laborers. All dark… Ominous.

The film sharply stopped again. The scene changed to that of golden sunlight in an open stone town with architecture not too dissimilar from the Sharkrin fortress. It was beautiful, almost like a dream.

None from the viewing party spoke nor questioned the change, finding a moment to breathe from the brief nightmare. Their wide eyes took in every aspect of the video.

The shock of battle slowly wore off as the plot began, taking their minds somewhere else. Four younger star-sents… *males* conversed over their mothers signing papers or something similar—the subtitles were not fully clear at times.

Each of the red hat-wearing males wore bright smiles in a massive group, numbering in the hundreds, listening to another, older star-sent preach over a great opportunity for them and the necessity of soldiers. He promised the youth honor, a future, and great victory, erupting the young males into more cheers and jubilation… He promised them that they were the greatest generation.

The pups gratefully marched in lines, half-naked. They received their uniforms with joy—great coats, just the same as Javelin wore… Just the same as the dead star-sents earlier.

And they marched again, singing of tea and sugar and coffee across green plains and lush forests. Their jubilance was unmatched, each interaction filled with jokes and chitters… until they were brought forth to the land without flora. The four young males had not a moment of rest in the trenches.

Explosions rang out. Javelin recoiled as dirt flew into the air, collapsing bridges and bunkers all around. The males scurried into holes and shelter for safety. And the bombs kept going off. Minutes passed in silence amongst the star-sent, each terrified of where the next one may detonate.

Thankfully, it passed. The captain audibly sighed in relief, but tensed at the sound of a whistle. Bullets whizzed by as the trench was immediately assaulted by… other *star-sent*. Shots rang out as males dashed to the defensive line, charging with fear in their eyes.

They died. Comrades died. More blood pooled into the muddied puddles.

All the Malkrin in the room were silent beholders to the carnage that rivaled that of the abhorrent.

Those eruptions, once satisfying means to cull beasts by the dozens, became nightmarish uncertainties ready to take lives in a moment. Grenades were sudden bringers of death, just the same as distant rifles were prepared to snap heads at a flicker of motion.

Every corner of the filthy trenches and macabre corpse-filled no-mans-lands promised the demise of each struggling soldier.

It was endless. That was the worst part for her. The bombs could never be predicted. A single bullet could take a friend in an instant. There was nothing but uncertainty and agony. She could barely breathe as she watched.

And yet the two sides fought for the same tract of land again and again. She did not even know who the enemy was! What sect were the males the camera followed from? Were they virtuous in this suffering at all!? Mountain Lord, there was no point to any of it! No explanation for the violence! It was killing. Constant, brutal, killing! No soul found honor or glory in a war without reason… All they did was fight.

Forty thousand perished every two weeks. Javelin could not fathom forty-thousand living beings, much less the disregard of the dead!

…Sometimes, there would be brief moments of reprieve. Away from the trenches, away from the war, those who lived scrambled for the joy they lacked.

They sang together and ate together, sharing stories and jokes just as Javelin did with her own squadmates. Yet, things so natural as vying for the fairer sex became unusually foreign in a land without bullets flying—how could they find ‘normal’ after everything they had seen?

These brief glimpses of something better were always overshadowed by the horror beyond, be it subtle or obvious. One soldier had a mate at home to live for. Reinforcements in the hundred were found perished from gas, their eyes bleeding and their faces blue, before they could even reach the front line. Aerial drones in the sky fought over every breathing moment, just as the rattle of gunfire and artillery rang out in the distance. The war never truly offered true rest.

The soldiers, who had battled for years, watched their closest comrades die time and time again, were at the trench again. They were not defending this time. The gaunt stares of the soldiers were blank and pale as they lined up at the lip of their muddied hole, prepared for something more.

None of them hesitated on the order to charge. What once was terror was replaced by routine.

They ran through the mud, blood, and corpses. Craters and the endless, choking smog were their only protection. Frantic shots were complemented by habitual actions of throwing grenades and darting between cover—measures to ensure their survival for one more minute.

These minutes stacked upon each other as the trials constantly berated them, challenging every step of progress. A machine gun nest, a counter charge, a thrown explosive… It never stopped, not even when bodies became barriers amongst the mud.

Their goal was to push forward through death, and that they did.

The opposing trench, nearly emptied of its occupants, became the new battleground. Bayonets skewered unsuspecting foes, while bullets ripped through others.

It was just the same as it always was, the air filled with the screams of the fading souls and the look of terror in their eyes. More blood in the puddles. More faceless star-sents torn apart.

But they fought. The vaguest scraps of honor were awarded to those who defended their comrades and those who pushed forward.

And, this time, they were… *successful*. The warriors *conquered*. They feasted upon sausages and bread from the enemy’s stores. For a brief moment, Javelin felt a certain relief and pride for the star-sents, even through the savage depictions of gore behind the characters on screen. They did it. Years of fighting resulted in a victory as the older star-sent promised! Perhaps it was not so pure, but it was *something*.

…But the soldiers did not feel the same. The ground shook and groaned as they were inexplicably ordered to the lip of the trench again. The land beyond was torn and lifeless, obscured by the fog.

What could be there? Had they not won?

Massive silhouettes punctured through the white. Behemoths of metal and tracks lined up, opposing the soldiers.

Tanks.

The immediate hail of bullets cracked off the hulls like fifty-caliber rounds off of colossi shells. They had no gustavs, nor any cannons… They were *defenseless*.

The monstrous machines fired back, slaughtering the warriors in the trench by the dozen. Unstoppable, unbreakable death crawled forward. 

The soldiers nonetheless held their ground. Some were caught in machine-gun fire. One was crushed alive under the tracks, screaming until his torso was turned into red paste.

None of the watching spears moved. All they could do was watch the gore unfold, becoming witnesses to another slaughter.

The soldiers were forced to run. Some fought till their last, jamming grenades into tracks and through machine gun holes. Yet, even those brave enough were caught in the flames of even more enemy reinforcements. As if the bullets and bombs were not enough.

The very pools of blood turned to charred remnants. Shrieks of anguish filled the no-mans-land like birds fill forests.

Oh… Oh Mountain Lord, the howls and cries of the dying star-sents would haunt her forever. They were so visceral. So heinous. So *sickening*.

But the terrified foes still warred on through the deaths of thousands. They slammed their shovels into necks until blood gushed out. They fired their rifles until they were dry. They stabbed their foes in the chest and watched them drown in their own blood as the life drained from their eyes.

…After the barbarism, even in the safety of the backline, faces of perished and dying star-sents followed them. Were they lucky to be alive? One wrong mistake and they would have been the same.

And for what? They were back at the same trench they were drafted into years ago!

But in time, peace was promised. At hearing the news, some warriors danced like spirits in the light of fire, while the injured had their limbs hacked off. Any relief felt hollow. Any joy was a facade to embrace anything else than war… What point was the peace if so much damage had already be wrought? If so many had died?

Even then, in the wake of a promise to return to that golden city they once lived in, the living envied the dead… So much so that they would choose to join them by their own hand. 

Javelin could not watch and told herself so over and over. She thought to close the laptop and never watch a star-sent war ever again. It was nothing like that which she saw before.

…But she continued nonetheless. With wide eyes and shallow breaths, everyone watched in silence. Terrified, joyless silence.

The war was supposedly meant to end soon. The older, decorated star-sents said so. Yet, as the fat and affluent engorged themselves from the safety of their lairs, the soldiers marched back into the land of black dirt and smog once more.

The church used for medics was covered in blood and filled with bodies. The nearby town was desolate, empty, and torn apart by stray artillery shells. And the field of war, that harrowing strip between the trenches… No avians sang there, no grass grew there. It was the one landscape the gods did not make. But the star-sents went there time and time again.

Another charge to their deaths. More bloodshed without true purpose.

The blank-faced warriors marched on over the puddles of blood and fire. Their breaths grew heavy, and their footsteps came faster. There was no emotion in their eyes. There was nothing to feel anymore, for only agony awaited them… And they accepted it.

The soldiers and the poor pups recruited to fill in for the dead fought into the enemy trench once more. No longer was it routine, but bestial, bloody combat. None cared to fight for ‘another minute.’ They growled like monsters and lashed out with their teeth, no longer star-sent but warped products of their war.

And they died. No ground was gained. No battle was truly ‘won.’

It was hollow. Empty.

Just as the movie began, it ended with a calm, snowy winter. Beyond the nightmares, there were still forests and avians, alive and carrying on despite everything. Powdered snow covered the dead, the living, and what remained in between. The same pools of mud and blood remained.

It was over. Seventeen ***million*** dead to change nothing.

A war without reason.

The black screen returned to the video-selection page. The screen illuminated all the frozen Malkrin in the living room, letting silence enter their ears for the first time in hours.

Javelin let out a shaky exhale and looked down at the firearm between her legs.

Where did it really come from? What was its true purpose? …Oh, Mountain Lord, what was to become of her?

She had always wondered how helpless it would feel to be against star-sent weaponry. The fear it must strike in her enemies was unmatched. It was acceptable because they were just that: enemies. It was right. How righteous she was to use the star-sent’s gifts. How powerful she was to behold them.

But the captain understood now. The fools—Kegara, the paladins, all of them—they were so ignorant, so *unaware* of how truly lucky they were. 

With a sudden sense of obligation, Javelin thanked the gods, every one of them, that her star-sent was different. Poised. *Compassionate*. She thanked them that her own war was not so hollow. She thanked them for the true, honorable reason to bear her weapon.

She had no words for that which she felt. Empty, fearful, depressed, relieved, and despondent did not feel apt.

All she knew… was to be grateful.

1pxsl6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1pxsl6p/nonhearing_loss_tinitus_began_8_weeks_ago/,Non-hearing loss tinitus began 8 weeks ago. (Positive story for those new to tinitus),"First of all. This is for people who have non-hearing loss related tinitus. If you have tinitus from a hearing issue, while I feel for you, this message may not resonate with you. I don’t know what hearing loss tinnitus is like.

So I am a 41yo male, married with kids and I would describe myself as quite a stressed out, anxious person. I don’t exercise much. I drink a few beers most nights to wind down. I wouldn’t get drunk, but drank enough to take the edge off…

And then 8 weeks ago…out of the blue, it started. I did all the doctor and audiologist tests. They couldn’t find anything physiological that would be causing it.

And holy hell, that first 4 weeks of tinitus drove me insane. I was freaking out so much, I was scared man. It was sooo loud i couldn’t think straight.

Anyway, after the 4th week, something changed in my mindset. I accepted that it was not going away anytime soon. I realised that IN MY CASE (and maybe yours too) it was psychological, and it was a message.

I went out and I bought some airpods and played rain sounds/white noise when the tinitus was being particularly annoying. The newer models have ‘transparency mode’ which lets you still hear conversations easily. I slept with soft headband earphones on with rain sounds to make sleep easier. I stopped drinking alcohol. I stopped drinking coffee. I started eating healthier. I started going for jogging sessions. I started doing mindfulness body scan guided meditations. I started to RELAX. 

I treated the tinnitus as more of an annoyance, rather than something that was scary.

And guess what. After 4 weeks from that mindest shift moment (8 weeks total), 90% of the day i don’t even notice it. I don’t even use the airpods during the day now. I might notice it for 5 minutes, twice a day now max. I will admit, when trying to sleep, its definitely still there. But a 20 minute midfulness body scan and relaxation guided meditation followed by putting my sleep rain sounds headphones on, and i’m out like a light and sleep like a baby.

It really does not bother me now, and I believe one day soon it will be gone. But if not, so be it. If it stays like how it is now, I genuinely don’t care. 

My point is this. Tinnitus turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I feel healthier physically and mentally due to the lifestyle changes I’ve made since developing tinitus. I play with my kids more and enjoy the good times when i‘m not noticing tinnitus. I believe this has all contributed to my tinnitus drastically reducing.

So if you are in that first few weeks of newly developed tinnitus and are in that pit of despair, scrolling this tinnitus reddit looking for some hope…just like i did 8 weeks ago.

IT WILL NOT BE LIKE THIS FOREVER. IT WILL GET BETTER. 

Just relax, avoid stimulants, meditate, mask the sound, go do fun things, don’t wallow in the despair, distract yourself as much as possible. Try your hardest to calm that nervous system down, and you will re-habituate ;)

I drink most days. Smoke every day. I train when I can—bodybuilding keeps me steady. If there’s a gym, I go. Otherwise, the day drifts.
I’ve been in Manila for three months. Coffee shops. Malls. Pub crawls. The days between, I drink. I hate the water. The islands don’t help. The city doesn’t either.
I feel like I have no purpose.
I’m an introvert. I get lonely. That’s why I stay in hostels. People around me make the silence less loud. Still, I feel disconnected. Just surrounded.
ADHD makes it worse. I can’t stick to anything. Can’t finish a movie. Can’t sit still long enough to matter.
I’ve been to Vietnam, Thailand, Laos. Peru—I saw Machu Picchu. Lived in Medellín. Bolivia. Brazil. I’ve seen enough to know it’s not the place that empties you. It’s the days themselves.
Being a decent-looking foreigner has its dangers. You attract trouble without meaning to. In Laos, I ran into the wrong people. A local attacked me. The law was on their side. I hid in bushes. Slept with the dirt. Two weeks. Waiting, watching. Planning. My father and the embassy helped me navigate a way out. It wasn’t heroic. It was survival. I moved. I survived.

So, here it is:

I met a guy over a year ago, he started pursuing me, inviting for dates, complimenting, etc. We met only twice, it was all good, and then he suddenly started pulling away. I immediately sensed it and didn't chase him or ask for clarifications (it was hard AF! and a very painful experience to go through). 6 months passed, he randomly messaged me with ""how are you?"". I ignored it. Then another 6 months passed, and I recently added a Christmas selfie with my cousin, he sent a message wishing me merry Christmas, I responded with ""thank you - belated merry Christmas"".

He then sent me a voice note: ""M., it's very gracious of you that you even replied to me, that's very kind. Uhm I hope you had a nice Christmas and having a nice break. I'm slightly wired on coffee at Heathrow airport so I thought I'd message you because I'm meaningfully mentally ill, obviously. Uhm, sorry about the last time we were speaking, I had a fairly tumultuous year, and a bit which I'm not going to bore you with in this voicemail. I'm sorry, it's not that I was indifferent to you, I really liked you, although that was a strange way of showing it, I can see it, oh god, but I'm sorry. And if you're ever in X again I'd actually love to see you, but you probably not particularly want that I do, which I also understand, if you know what I mean. Let me know if you're in X, I'd love to see you"".

His voice seemed serious, nervous and slightly embarrassed.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pxsh3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/truckerfunny/comments/1pxsh3b/searching_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,searching ultimate perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1766931710.0,truckerfunny,0,1.0,False

1pxsdol,https://www.reddit.com/r/men/comments/1pxsdol/he_asked_me_out_but_had_already_paid_for_his_own/,He asked me out but had already paid for his own coffee when I arrived. I was not late.,"Want to preface by saying we’ve known each other for 20+ years so this is NOT just a first date. We’re 30.

I’m trying to figure out if I’m being overly sensitive or if this would bother other people too.

The guy asked me out and we met at Starbucks. Right off the bat, he did this thing that already annoys me. He kept asking which Starbucks to go to, multiple times, even though we have been to the exact same one together before (in our childhood town - and it's a 5 minute walk from his parents' house!). I know he asked me multiple times hoping I’d change my answer (he wanted me to meet him at his parents’ - he’s home for the holidays).

He got there ONE minute before me and told me he already ordered his coffee on the Starbucks app. So then I left where he was standing and went to stand in line to order. He then tried to sound gentlemanly and said, “Oh, I can order for you on the app!” I said it was fine as I was moving to stand in line. At that point, he didn’t wait with me or stand nearby. He just went and sat down at a table.

After I ordered, I joined him. A few minutes later, his drink was ready. He got up, went to the pickup counter, grabbed his coffee, and came back (took about 30 seconds). He didn’t even glance at the counter to see if mine was ready (it had my name on it), let alone try to grab it. As soon as he sat back down, I went up to grab my coffee.

I know this sounds small, but it rubbed me the wrong way. If roles were reversed, I would have waited for him before ordering (or actually ANYONE I'm meeting up with) and if he was late, I would've texted him to ask him what he wanted (and ordered for both of us). It wasn’t about buying me coffee. It was more about awareness and basic courtesy.

Is there an unspoken rule of waiting for your date to arrive (no matter how long you've known them for) before ordering?

Tldr; I think he ordered his own coffee on the app so that he didn't have to pay for me. Is this ever socially acceptable?",2,1766931439.0,men,5,1.0,False
