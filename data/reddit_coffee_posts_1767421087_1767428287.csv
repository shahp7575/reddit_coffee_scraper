1q2p4jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/VibeCodeCamp/comments/1q2p4jf/anyone_else_struggling_to_keep_focus_when_coding/,anyone else struggling to keep focus when coding? My recent 'find' helped more than coffee!,"So, I've been in a bit of a code slump recently. You know that feeling? Where even a simple bug fix turns into a multi-hour ordeal? Tbh, I thought caffeine was my only savior until I stumbled across a life-changing tool — voice dictation for coding. Sounds weird, right? But hear me out...

I’ve always been skeptical about using my voice for anything tech, especially coding. But the constant typing was wearing me down (and my wrists!), so I thought, eh, why not give it a shot? Here's what I discovered after diving into the rabbit hole of dictation apps:

1. Apple's Built-in Dictation

- Pros: Already on your device, no extra cost
- Cons: It's like talking to a brick wall. If your code’s not simple, expect a bunch of gibberish!

2. Dragon NaturallySpeaking

- Pros: Once the king of dictation
- Cons: Feels stuck in the '90s, overpriced for what it offers rn

3. Aqua Voice

- Pros: Decent for general dictation
- Cons: Struggles with coding terms and syntax, makes me sound like I'm speaking another language

4. Willow Voice

- Pros: Seriously good with coding nuances, formats text pretty accurately if you’re dictating emails or docs as well. The AI-enhanced features are a godsend.
- Cons: Has a subscription fee, and there's a bit of a learning curve to master all the features

5. Wisprflow

- Pros: Good for basic dictation
- Cons: Lacks advanced coding support and can be glitchy with longer sessions

After trying these out, Willow Voice** has been my go-to for actually speaking code. It’s not perfect, but imo, it's the closest thing to magic out there. Fewer typos, less frustration, and I can finally focus on problem-solving rather than typo-hunting.

What about you guys? Are there any other tools or hacks you swear by to keep your coding sessions smooth and productive? Let’s swap some pointers!",1,1767427777.0,VibeCodeCamp,0,1.0,False

1q2p2k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1q2p2k1/my_vision_of_a_friends_health_problem/,My vision of a friend’s health problem.,"Hello everyone, in this post I would like to tell you about the paranormal experience I had three years ago around this time, during that year’s Christmas season.

It was December 22nd, and I woke up in my bed at around 8 in the morning. The blind in my bedroom was raised and bright sunlight was pouring in. A completely normal, bright morning. I was still sleepy, so I decided to stay in bed a little longer, although I didn’t fall fully asleep. I remained trapped in that peaceful state between wakefulness and sleep.

While in that state, I saw—despite having my eyes closed—my entire bedroom, and in front of me, a being, as if it had materialized right there. It was clearly the figure of a man, although it looked more like a crash-test dummy or one of those figures used to learn how to draw human anatomy. It was motionless, standing upright, with both hands over its stomach, toward the right side of its abdomen, and on its almost featureless face there was a grimace of pain. The classic posture and expression of someone in a movie who has just been shot in the abdomen.

I wasn’t frightened, but I suddenly woke up completely with a bad feeling.

I went downstairs to make myself a coffee, and while I was drinking it, I looked at my phone and felt that I had to write to someone.

To whom? Not my parents, my sister, or my grandparents. Something told me I had to write to the WhatsApp group I have with two friends of mine—let’s call them L and P.

Both confirmed that they were fine, and that reassured me. I didn’t tell them anything about the “dummy” at that moment, since P is quite hypochondriac and I didn’t want to scare him. I did tell my family, though, but they didn’t give it much importance.

The days went by and I still felt uneasy, but nothing happened.

Until the morning of the 25th, when L, P, and I wrote to each other in the group chat to ask how we had spent Christmas Eve with our families and whether Santa Claus had been good with the presents.

P told us he wasn’t feeling very well, which he attributed to the heavy dinner his sister had prepared.

At that moment something in my head said, “NO,” and right then I knew it wasn’t indigestion.

Hours passed, and that same Christmas night, P was in the emergency room. Gastroenteritis, the doctors told him.

“NO,” I heard again.

At that point I thought I was becoming paranoid, and that work stress, the holidays, and genuine concern for my friend were playing tricks on me.

From then on until the 28th, P’s condition worsened, until his sister decided to take him back to the hospital because the pain was unbearable. His gallbladder was necrotic and required immediate surgery.

Believe me, I almost fainted at that moment.

When I was finally able to visit him at his home, I explained my vision and how the “dummy” was holding its stomach and how its face reflected pain. My imitation made his sister turn pale with horror, because, according to her, those were exactly P’s gestures of pain during that week—including the hands on the right side of the abdomen, where the gallbladder is.

1q2oqlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1q2oqlw/from_my_heart/,From my heart,"I’m not angry or hoping for bad things. It’s the opposite of that. You know, I just wish it would be possible for everyone to be happy. To live fulfilling lives, long healthy lives. To have as much fun as possible and be kind to eachother and never go without. The past is painful. Too many terrible things happened. I dunno, maybe I should be mad. Maybe sometimes I still am. But I always hope that no matter what everyone is doing alright. That their lives are only getting better, whatever that means for them. Even though there were the very bad times, sometimes I still miss the good times. My chest is heavy thinking of it all now. Sometimes I wish things were different. I am grateful that I was strong enough to look ahead instead of staying where I was. At the end of the day, I can’t change anyone or anything that they choose to do. I can only live my own life. And I have to do right by me. And man, it’s not always the easiest thing to do. I’d never take back the time that I gave. At the same time, I will never waste another second being miserable to make someone else feel better. As much as I wish I’d never been born, I was. And I’m here. And no one else can cultivate a happy life for me. That’s on me. And the same is true for you too. So even when you’re sad or lonely. Please always remember that your happiness matters. But you have to create it. I want you to understand that. I want you to come to that realization. Even if it’s just in the tiniest things. Take the time to appreciate the sky when it’s so blue and the clouds are all white and puffy. Or the smell of delicious fresh coffee brewing in the morning. Only you can frame your mind in that way. I could never make you happy. You have to do that. And that is so powerful. You just have to make that first step. Yeah, all I want is for everyone to be happy. That’s what I hope for the most.

I had been sipping my coffee, staring out the window at the quiet street, when Ruth’s voice cut through the calm like a blade.

“Mira is gone.”

I froze mid-sip, the bitter liquid catching in my throat. I wanted to laugh, to ask what joke she was playing. But the sharp, measured calm in her tone rooted me to the chair.

“What do you mean gone?” I asked, my voice uneven.

“Dead,” she said. Simple. Flat. As if stating the time of day.

I blinked. The word made no sense. I tried to recall the phone call from last week, the sketches she had left on my desk, her laughter echoing from the backyard. It all felt fresh, tangible. How could she be gone?

“You’re wrong,” I said. My voice trembled. I clutched my mug like a lifeline. “I just saw her. She… she was here.”

Ruth shook her head slowly. “No, she wasn’t. You’re remembering incorrectly. You must be confused.”

Confused. I felt my pulse quicken. My mind scrabbled for explanations—fatigue, stress, misremembered dreams—but none fit. The apartment felt suddenly too quiet, the air too still, as if the world itself were holding its breath.

I tried to argue, listing her visits, her calls, the small notes she had left on the fridge. Ruth listened, expression unreadable, and repeated her calm truth: she was gone.

The room seemed to shrink around me. The sunlight looked wrong, the shadows slightly off. My memories, vivid and alive, now felt like evidence of a crime only I had witnessed.

1q2on62,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1q2on62/havent_gotten_any_deep_sleep_in_a_whole_year/,Haven't gotten any deep sleep in a whole year,"Hello everybody! 

I (26F) have huge troubles sleeping. My sleep quality started decreasing about 10 years ago, when i was i  highschool. I was sharing my room with my very young sister, and our parents would leave early in the morning, so I learned to be very aware of what was happening around me in order to watch her and make sure she's safe even when i was asleep. That led to my roommate in uni being annoyed with me because I would be instantly woken up by the slightest noise in the whole apartment and not being able to fall back asleep, but it got better over time. 

The thing is, back when sharing the room with my sister I was getting good rest while being half-asleep basically, and then in uni I was easily woken up from my deep sleep, but I was getting deep sleep. 

For the past couple of years though, I started having huge difficulties falling asleep. I frequently toss and turn all night and can't fall asleep at all, despite being really tired. I am also aware of the passing of time and aware of every sound around me. If you start talking to me in the middle of the night when I'm asleep, I'll be able to have a full conversation on the spot, I don't need to be ""woken up"" and take a few minutes to become coherent. 

On top of that, I remember the last time I went to bed, fell asleep and just woke up in the morning fully rested and ready to stand up right away and start my day. No tossing and turning, no frequent waking up, no problem falling asleep, not aware of the passing of time, nothing. I was fully OUT, got deep sleep and so much rest. That happened one whole year ago. Since then, no deep sleep whatsoever. 

I'm starting to be very worried about this since it could impact my overall health, which I care a lot about. I work out, take vitamins, eat only meals I cook myself, I don't drink alcohol, no coffee either and don't smoke. I've tried taking melatonin gummies in the past but I just got headaches and nothing else. 

Has anyone had similar experiences to this and if so, could you please share your story? I feel very alone in this and I have nonidea how to even start managing it.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1q2oj1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1q2oj1w/how_to_stay_focused_in_a_world_that_wants_you/,How to stay focused in a world that wants you numb: tips TikTok influencers won’t tell you,"Ever feel like your brain is stuck in 15-second loops? You're reading a book, but your thumb twitches like it's looking for the next scroll. You're trying to work, but next thing you know, you've watched three mukbangs, a “that girl” morning routine, and a random guy explain finance with a whiteboard. You’re not broken. You’re living in a perfectly engineered attention trap.

This post is for anyone who's tired of feeling scattered, overstimulated, and vaguely anxious. Pulled together the sharpest lessons from legit research, not watered-down hacks from some “productivity guru” on Instagram who’s trying to sell you a $40 planner. You’ll get actual tools that work, backed by neuroscience and behavior psychology.

Let’s un-numb ourselves.

* **Your attention isn’t just slipping, it’s being stolen**
   * *Tristan Harris*, former Google ethicist, explains in *The Social Dilemma* that tech companies literally run thousands of experiments daily to design features that hijack your brain's reward system. Once your dopamine baseline drops, the default becomes reaching for your phone just to feel normal.
   * The average person is interrupted every **11 minutes**, and it takes about **23 minutes** to return to deep focus, according to Gloria Mark’s research at UC Irvine.
   * *Insight:* You’re not bad at focusing. You’re just being outplayed by billion-dollar algorithms. The first step is awareness. The second is fireproofing your environment.
* **Kill the infinite feeds, save your working memory**
   * Working memory is what helps you hold and manipulate ideas in your mind. It’s like your brain’s scratchpad.
   * But when you constantly switch tabs, check texts, and consume short-form video, you’re overloading the scratchpad.
   * According to a review by the *National Institutes of Health*, chronic task-switching can physically shrink grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex, the part linked to focus and empathy.
   * *Fix:* Use *feed blockers* like News Feed Eradicator or Freedom. Turn grayscale on your phone. Use the “one tab” rule: only one tab open per type of task (writing, researching, etc). This preserves cognitive bandwidth.
* **No, you don’t need motivation. You need a ritual**
   * James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits*) says motivation is the unreliable friend who never shows up on time. Discipline is what moves the needle.
   * Replace “get focused” with “sit down and open the doc at 8:30 AM every day.” Your brain loves automation.
   * Habit stacking works: tie your focus time to an existing habit. For example:
      * *After brewing coffee, I open my noise-blocking playlist and set a 60-minute Pomodoro.*
      * *After lunch, I go for a walk and voice-note one big idea instead of scrolling.*
   * Rituals signal to your brain: “This is go time.”
* **Learn how to use boredom again**
   * Dopamine researcher *Dr. Anna Lembke* (Stanford, author of *Dopamine Nation*) explains that constant stimulation rewires your brain to avoid boredom at all costs. But boredom is where creative and deep thinking begin.
   * Try a simple “dopamine fast”:
      * No social media, no sugar, no music, no screens… for just 3 hours. Sit with it. Let your brain detox.
      * Keep a notepad nearby. People report that their best insights come during boredom blocks.
   * Boredom is a feature, not a bug.
* **Rebuild your focus like a muscle**
   * A 2021 meta-analysis in *Psychological Bulletin* confirms that attention span is *trainable*, just like endurance.
   * Start small. 10 minutes of deep work per day. Then gradually increase.
   * Tools that help:
      * **Forest app** – plant a tree for every focused session
      * **Coffitivity** – ambient café noise for flow state
      * **Endel or Brain.fm** – AI-generated music backed by neuroscience for focus
   * Track your improvements weekly, not daily. Focus builds in waves, not perfect streaks.
* **Protect your mornings like sacred time**
   * Cognitive scientists like John Medina (author of *Brain Rules*) say the brain is sharpest within 2 hours of waking up.
   * If you check email or IG first-thing, you waste your most strategic brainpower reacting instead of creating.
   * *Tip:* Try a “no-input morning.” No social media, no emails, no news until after 10 AM. Do your highest-leverage work first.
* **Read books. Not tweets about books.**
   * Long-form text rebuilds your linear thinking. It rewires your brain to sustain attention and resist distraction.
   * Neuroscientist *Maryanne Wolf* says in *Reader, Come Home* that digital skimming changes the brain’s wiring, making it harder to read deeply over time. But the reverse is also true: the more books you read, the better your focus becomes.
   * *Hack:* Start with 10 pages a day. Use physical books to avoid switching. Track pages, not minutes.
   * Not sure where to begin? Try *Deep Work* by Cal Newport or *Stolen Focus* by Johann Hari.

Focus is not about doing more. It’s about subtracting noise and getting good at staying where you are. In a world designed to numb you, learning to pay attention is the ultimate rebellion.

However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Usual Saturday, made my coffee and thought of calling parents cauz I was missing them a lot. Was talking about how the week went and my papa goes - "" beta, tum gussa mt karna, par ek rishta aaya hai..."" 
I was like, ""papa yaar... Nahi karni hai mujhe shadi""... He went away in anger.

I asked mum to go in another room. I was very anxious cauz I couldn't handle all the expectations they started putting upnon me since a year from nkw regarding marriage. 

I told her the half truth. I said - ""mujhe ladkiya nahi pasand hai..."" 
""Kya? mtlb kaise feel hota hai?""
""Friends jaisa, but usse jyada kuchh nahi""
She went silent... For a minute straight.
I was like, kuchh bolo...

She went... Aise kaise?? 

I told her about all the inferences she herself clocked back in my childhood... She again went silent.

I told her, how hard it has been like for me since school days and how different i always felt from the boys around me. And even now in office how whenever the topic of relationship comes, i mask the smiles and just have to nod along. 

Ecen though she couldn't understand why and how this works? She said - ""mai tumhe force nhi karungi... Kyoki maine apni life me hi dekha hai. Tum apni khushi dhoondo, mai ussi me khush hu...""

""And tumhare budhape ke liye adopt kar lenge..."" ... Internally was like ... Damn... So progressive. 

Not a shed of tear came at her eye nor mine. She is very strong. 

I even told her that my brother knows... She was shocked at that tbh. She said... -""Oh issi liye kah raha tha ki... Not necessarily elder has to marry first""... 

Afterall she is an indian homemaker mum, so she brought up the medical angle... I told her, it's not something one can change...

I haven't told her the full thing yet, that, not just i don't fancy girls, [ i am attracted to men...]

I hope this will interaction will keep them from bringing up the marriage topic.


So yeah, It's New year and have told my mum about me...

1. Has two pod options: 8-9g and 17-18g
2. Is pressure-controlled and extracts coffee at 8-10 bar
3. Has the option to fill in our own coffee in the pods
4. The coffee pod lies flat in the machine, so there's an even extraction

For reference, I own a Brim 19 bar espresso machine and a Bella Pro espresso machine.  
  
I have an older Breville Smart Grinder Pro (BCG820BKSXL).  However, I wanted to get a newer grinder to have just for an espresso set up and use the Breville for my Moccamaster.    
  
I bought a Tuni G1 Conical Burr Coffee Grinder, as I was trying to stay around $100 for now.  I'm struggling with it.  

I set the machine up to grind espresso using Starbucks Italian Roast.  At first, hardly any grounds spit out.  I set it to grind for pour overs and started getting yield, so I started over again at setting 4.  That worked, though it seemed to take a long time to get the amount I needed.  
  
I packed my 51mm pressurized portafilter (double shot) with 14 grams of coffee and used a paper filter. 

The espresso struggled to come through.  So I Googled the issue.  It said my grind was too fine.  So I tried to back it up.  I tried three different settings.  Still same results -- the Bella Pro, which had been working previously, wasn't able to draw the shot.  It was a mess.  The Brim had the same result.

OK, so I tried to grind espresso using the Breville, because before that worked.  Now, my Breville is making odd noises.  That's an issue for another day.

So, I decided to go out and get some Cafe La Llave to compare.  Ran test shots through each machine -- shots pulled fine.  

Before I send the Tuni back, and because I'm Googling myself into insanity, I want to see if anyone had a suggestion on why this might be happening.

I realize I'm not using high quality machines nor a bean that anyone here typically likes.  However, it's what I have right now.  I'm just trying to get the hang of things.  

TL:DR My Tuni Grinder doesn't seem to grind useable coffee for my espresso makers.  It barely extracts anything other than a mess.

That guy is me, I can’t even have coffee because I am too sensitive too caffeine. 

The closest I get is porn, but that’s basically once a day, twice on a blue moon; and probably no more than 3 days consecutively or it starts to hurt too much lol…

Anyways, the topic got me thinking whether addictions in general are THAT bad. For example most people are probably addicted to caffeine and most of those are fine (I never knew a person irl who actually suffer from coffee addiction).

Coincidentally there are a lot of famous/important people who are known to do drugs regularly (take Elon Musk or Hollywood actors).

Sure, they are dysfunctional in many ways and has success attributable to confounding factors (born with money for example). 

I have been reading Kitchen Confidential and man these chefs work like 12 hours shifts, do drugs, pass out, and do it again tomorrow. That sounds very functional (and maybe high functioning).

I have no doubt on the bad effect of drugs, but I am beginning to think some dabbling into addictive side of things aren’t that bad. 

For example most people drink, lots of people drink quite a bit, but most people aren’t alcoholic that’s negatively affecting life. 

In addition, there are some “good” evidences like microdosing or experiments showing positive outcomes from using psilocybin.

I am not encouraging drug use, but I am debating whether drugs/addictions are not gateway to hell as devastating as it has been portrayed by larger narratives; especially the legal stuffs. Of course, use in moderation gets milder as the substance of choice gets harder.

Lastly I wonder whether maximizing functioning in general actually involve some dabbing into addiction; microdosing if you will.

1q2obgv,https://www.rawstory.com/trump-ai-failure/,This 'utter failure' from Trump could 'stun the world' in 2026: researcher,"# **This ‘Utter Failure’ From Trump Could ‘Stun the World’ in 2026: Researcher**

**Friday, January 2, 2026, 3:37 p.m. ET**  
*Matthew Chapman*  

**Source:** Raw Story  
⤷https://www.rawstory.com/trump-ai-failure/

AI researcher Gary Marcus is betting on a very unglamorous plot twist: Trump’s big pro AI push starts looking like a money furnace, the public turns sour on data centers and energy costs, and the White House tries to quietly moonwalk away from the whole thing. In Marcus’s scenario, the painful part is not just the bubble pop. It’s the political bill that arrives afterward, with AI’s harms becoming a daily headline and Trump wearing it.

> “The giant AI infrastructure plays (like Project Stargate) that he championed after his inauguration will look like an unprofitable and underused mistake.”

> “Trump will bolt for the door. ‘Coffee chatbot, we hardly knew ye,’ Trump will be overheard to say.”

### What the Article Covers
• The piece highlights Marcus’s prediction that Trump will start distancing himself from aggressively pro AI policies by the end of 2026.  
• Marcus argues AI infrastructure bets could look underused and unprofitable, while weak regulation becomes a political liability.  
• The article points to early signals: public skepticism, local protests against data centers, and GOP pushback to federal attempts to curb state AI regulation.

### When the AI Bet Backfires
• This is a politics of consequences scenario: hype first, infrastructure second, backlash third, and then the sprint for plausible deniability.  
• The flashpoint is local and physical. Data centers, energy prices, land use, water, and noise turn “AI” from an abstract future thing into a neighbor problem.  
• If AI harms stack up at the same time the economics start wobbling, the story stops being “innovation” and becomes “who signed off on this?”

Now I have none of that and the isolation is suffocating""",2,1767424507.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

Last Pick: **Bulls ML✅(ENDS 6-POTD LOSING STREAK)+1.7U**

Today's Pick: **Baker Mayfield 2+ Passing TDs**

**Score Bet**: **+100**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1U

League: Carolina Panthers vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3:30PM CST on ABC/ESPN)

**Recap**: That POTD WIN ends the 6-POTD losing streak! And a great way to end the streak on a hefty near 2-1 underdog (+170)! I knew eventually we were going get one of these! But I knew the past 3 POTDs were risky to bet on either side and this one just happen to go our way! So no more Self-fade POTDs or risky POTDs, whatever you like to call it, but we moving back to value wagers that I actually favor, **however, this may very well could be my last POTD. I ran these POTDs as long as I could and unfortunately I will no longer be DK Silver tier member (expired on January 3rd, 2026), which means I will be charged $0.50 per wager. But this does not mean goodbye and I may possibly be able to still handicap POTD thru other betting platforms that doesn't charge a fee per wager. We shall see after this POTD**, I would realistically at least like to get thru this weekend, but let's get to this potentially last POTD because I am just as anxious as some of you are!

**Matchup:** I'm going to feature two wagers here, one is a bit of a longshot and the other a even money value wager, but the even money play will be the selected POTD. You decide which play is for you, pick and choose, tail both or split your wager (or just fade or pass), all up to you. First play is Baker Mayfield 2+ Passing TDs. **Bakes has not played up to his standard or really anyone's standards. I expected a lot from him this season and ever since that shoulder injury he just has not looked right and this matchup certainly says this is a mismatch for Bakes. He went under his yards, attempts and of course his Passing TDs just a couple weeks ago against this defense,** if anything I do believe that he throws 1 INT to this Panthers defense, but I have to go wit my gut on this one. This is a big game and all the pressure is on Bakes. I have to go against the trends and stats. I could see the Panthers upsetting the Bucs, but I strongly believe that Bakes is going to rally and get at least 2+ Passing TDs in this game if not for the division win, they are going to go down throwing haymakers. I also expect Mike Evans, Godwin, Ebuka, McMillan all show out and get him his 2+ Passing TDs. He's gone over this line in his last game and he's playing at home, Bucs crowd is going to rally Bakes in this game. Bakes has also shown up in big games, especially last season matchup vs the Panthers and his postseason stats suggest that he is very clutch. Expect him to show up and show out!

[He threw 5 Passing TDs on Week 17 of 2024. Bakes love the pressure and I think he will throw at least 2 in this must win matchup!](https://preview.redd.it/3eeazd29z2bg1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48059648b02e08b65080c3ad4e813ea30421df1)

2nd wager I am betting is Sam Darnold 3+ Passing TDs. This is another BIG game between the Niners and Seahawks. This is for the division and for the #1 NFC Seed. A lot at stakes here and so why not take the team/player you're bullish on? I like this player prop because for one the Niners defense has an imposter syndrome lately. **The last 3 Weeks they gave up 24+ points to their opponents, including 38 points against the Bears last week, not to mention that they allowed 24 points to the dogshit Titans offense a few weeks ago**. Niners are missing key defensive players and it's been evident in their last 3 games, I expect Darnold to take advantage, especially compare to his previous matchup (**0 Passing TDs on Week 1).** Sam is also playing at home for the division/#1 seed. I do think Purdy set the pace and tone for the Niners, so I expect Darnold to match him TD for TD in this game. Projecting this to be a shootout, so why not take the +300 on Darnold to throw 3 TDs? Hawks will prolly get more rushing touches, but in a game where I lean to be a shootout, Darnold is going to have to sling the rock. Lastly Darnold is also playing for incentives in this game, **$500,000 for 150+ Passing Yds and another $500,000 for 3+ Passing TDs.**

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Baker Mayfield 2+ Passing TDs. Also wagering 0.5U on Sam Darnold 3+ Passing TDs both plays on Score Bet because they got the better odds. Lay it up, single wager each play, split your wager, pick and choose your play, or pass/fade 'em, all up to you guys! 

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond. For all these years I have been handicapping on Sportsbook subreddit and thru my very own reddit channel, I have nothing but gratitude.

I have seen a psychologist, hypnotherapist, taking all the natural anti anxiety supplements, exercising, delaying coffee in the morning etc but I really think I now need some additional help.

Chapter 1
Preston Bauer walked out of the bedroom with a suitcase.
I was curled on the sofa, the overcoat making me look even smaller.
He headed for the door; his 9back was cold and rigid.
He glanced back once, his face half-lit, half-shadowed.
In the end, he said nothing.
He just left.
I kept my head lowered for a long time. Only after what felt like forever did I finally lift it.
I looked toward the light outside.
It felt as if the whole world had abandoned me.
Even my husband didn't want me anymore.
Like everyone else, he thought I was rotten to the core.
I didn't deserve anyone's forgiveness.
My hand trembled as I touched my belly.
Just a week ago, there had been a four-month-old baby there.
But it left me.
I felt so lonely.
How I wished I could have a baby. I wanted to teach them how to read, how to sing.
I wanted to hear them call me ""Mom.""
But that would never happen.
The title ""Mrs. Bauer"" was never meant to be mine.
I guessed this was my punishment for snatching it away.
I slumped helplessly against the back of the sofa.
Then I let out a weak smile.
""It seems ... I really have no strength left,"" I murmured.
I don't know how long I sat there.
Eventually, I stood up, walked over, and turned the photo frame face down.
People say love lasts a lifetime.
But I was done loving.
I flicked the lighter. The flame touched the curtain tassel.
Just then, my phone rang.
Tilting my head, I was stunned for a second.
But I didn't answer it.
The caller wasn't about to give up, though.
Finally, I picked up.
""Hello?""
""Why didn't you answer earlier?""
I stared at the growing flame.
""What's up?""
""There's something wrong with Cam's liver. Come to the hospital for a compatibility test.""
I said nothing, coughing softly.
""Are you listening?""
I nodded.
As the smoke grew thicker, I coughed violently.
""I know...""
""Why are you coughing like that?""
""There's too much smoke.""
I didn't say anything more. I tossed the phone aside, grabbed the fire extinguisher, and put the fire out.
Finally, the last shred of flame was gone.
I dropped the extinguisher and lay on the sofa, one corner already scorched.
Then I gasped for air.
After a few minutes, my hand slowly moved to my liver.
Liver?
Very well.
Maybe I could make amends by helping Camille Avery, my sister.
Soon, I arrived at the hospital.
My parents had been waiting outside the ward.
My mother stomped her foot. ""Why are you only getting here now?""
I glanced at them, my gaze cold.
My father pulled at my mother's arm.
""That's enough.""
Then I followed them into the room.
My eyes drifted to the bed.
Yet, to my surprise, I saw Preston there.
I lowered my gaze, missing the trace of surprise flashing in his eyes.
""I'm heading to the office,"" he said.
Then he stood up and nodded at my parents, his tone flat.
He was always so composed.
Yet when he brushed past me, I felt his momentary panic.
I lifted my head and glanced outside the window.
I shouldn't be surprised by his reaction.
After all, I had miscarried twice, and he had never stayed at the hospital for me like this.
I thought I wasn't sad anymore.
But at this moment, I still felt a sting in my eyes.
Luckily, it lasted only a few seconds.
Then my eyes no longer held any trace of tears.
Camille was sleeping in bed, her face ghastly pale.
I raised my hand.
""What do you want to do?"" my mother roared sternly.
But my hand only fell gently on Camille's head, smoothing her disheveled hair.
After that, I turned to my parents.
""When does the compatibility test start?""
My father froze, startled by the dead-cold calm in my voice.
Just then, the doctor came in.
""Is she here?""
But when he saw me, he visibly paused.
Chapter 2
""You're not a suitable candidate for the match,"" the doctor said.
I didn't say anything.
""Didn't you hear me? Go back, Jeanne.""
I looked up at him, my voice pleading.
""I can do this. Please.""
Then I walked out.
Behind me, he said, his voice stern, ""Are you serious? After having a miscarriage just a couple of days ago?
""This isn't some joke! You could die!""
Already at the door, I paused for a second.
""No, I won't. It's just a compatibility test.""
His heavy sigh came from behind me.
There were so many tests to go through.
I decided to stay in the hospital for three days.
It'd be a chance to recuperate anyway.
Three days later.
Finally, all the tests were done.
I walked up to the fifth floor.
The heart-warming scene of the family of three holding each other close made me stop in my tracks.
My father noticed me first.
He gave me a wave.
I nodded and stepped inside.
""Dad, Mom, Cam.""
""Well?"" my mother asked eagerly. ""Are the results in yet?""
""Not yet,"" I said, shaking my head.
""I'm heading back.""
My eyes met Camille's.
But it only lasted a second before she looked down.
My mother glanced my way. ""Alright.""
I nodded and moved toward the door.
Just then, my father called out to me.
""Jean, I think this belongs to Pres. Maybe you could take it to him?""
I turned around.
Seeing the silver pendant in his hand, I was stunned.
He explained, ""I found it after he left that day.""
Instinctively, I looked over at Camille and my mother by the bed.
After a few seconds, I took it.
""OK.""
Then I walked out of the room.
My mother's voice drifted through the partly open door. ""What was that about? It's not like she can't see Pres.""
My father replied, ""Something's off with them. I don't think they'll last much longer.""
The hallway was dead quiet.
I left.
At the Bauer Group.
I waited for half an hour.
Then Preston finally came out of his meeting.
When he walked into his office and saw me, he frowned.
I finished the last of my tea and stood up.
Then I held out the pendant.
""I came to return this.""
He glanced at it.
The impatience on his face was undisguised.
He didn't take it.
Did he find it disgusting now that I'd touched it?
I set it down on his huge desk.
Then I gave him a nod and turned to go.
""Wait.""
He walked over to the desk.
I stopped.
""Is there something else?""
""Sit down,"" he said, pointing to the sofa.
I stood there, stunned, for a few seconds.
He took off his jacket without a word.
But I noticed his hands were clenched into fists.
I asked, ""You want to know if the match was successful, right?""
I was about to tell him the results weren't in yet.
But before I could, my phone buzzed.
I pulled it out.
His phone vibrated almost at the same time.
It hit me then.
He must have been tracking any updates closely.
I smiled faintly.
""If that's all, I'm going home. I need to rest up and get my strength back so I'm ready for the surgery.""
I was about to open the door when his voice stopped me.
""Jeanne, after the transplant ... let's try to make this work.""
My hand paused on the doorknob.
What did he just say?
Was he really willing to accept me?
The worst woman he'd ever known, according to him?
But...
I didn't want to try anymore.
I was tired.
Too tired to even try.
I opened the door and walked out.
My silence was answer enough.
Chapter 3
I went home.
After stewing a chicken, I walked out of the kitchen.
Bored, I turned on the TV.
Before I realized it, I fell asleep, the bowl with the soup left on the coffee table, the TV still on.
The next day, I woke up.
I was still lying on the sofa.
Everything was so quiet.
Sunlight filtered through the curtains, spilling scattered light on the floor.
The villa felt so big.
I should get a cat.
At that thought, I pulled out my phone, wanting to browse online.
Finally, I set my eyes on one.
But then I exited the page.
Having a cat?
I'd pass.
A cat was a lifelong duty, not something to decide on a whim.
A week before the surgery.
I was admitted to the hospital.
My mother came for a visit.
She sat by the bed for a long time, yet neither of us talked.
She remained silent, and I wasn't exactly keen on speaking either.
Finally, she broke the silence. ""Sorry. All the private rooms on the fifth floor are taken. Or your father and I would have gotten you one.""
I gave a brief nod.
Then I turned to look out the window.
""You were quite chatty when you were little. What changed?""
With a sigh, she stood up.
""I'm going upstairs. I'll drop by some other time.""
""Alright.""
She left.
My gaze swept from the spot she had sat to the bag of fruit she had placed by the bed.
Then I let out a laugh.
She had stood up, picked up the bag, put it back down, and left, looking awkward—her whole demeanor seemed so funny.
I never knew—she'd actually feel embarrassed.
I didn't get it.
Couldn't she have gone upstairs to drop off the fruit first, then come down to see me?
But ... I guessed I shouldn't be surprised.
After all, she hated me.
Why would she go downstairs just for me?
The last tests were today.
The surgery was tomorrow.
With all the test reports, I went back to the room.
It was as cold and empty as ever.
Sitting on the bed, I stared ahead unfocused, my eyes dazed.
Why did it feel so cold and empty?
Oh, right.
Didn't Preston say he wanted to make things between us work?
He never came back when I was at home recuperating.
And he was nowhere to be seen during my week in the hospital.
Was that how he planned to make things work?
No, wait.
He said to make this work after the transplant.
I knew.
He didn't really care about whether things between us would work or not.
He simply felt he owed me, so he decided to repay me with his entire life.
All he wanted was for Camille to be healthy.
For that, he could sacrifice everything.
On the surgery day.
Camille and I were about to be wheeled into the operating room.
Preston rushed over in time.
""Dad, Mom, I'm so scared..."" Camille bit her lip.
""Don't worry, Cam. Just think of it as a long nap. The doctor said once you're through the surgery, you'll be better than ever.""
My mother smoothed the hair under Camille's surgical cap.
Preston strode over. ""Is the surgery about to begin?""
""Yes.""
Camille pulled her hand from our mother's grasp and reached out toward him.
He extended his hand subconsciously.
But then she pulled her hand back.
She put on a smile instead.
""Hi, Pres.""
Preston's hand froze in mid-air.
He glanced at me and quickly pulled it back.
""Medical science is very advanced these days. You've got nothing to worry about,"" he said to Camille reassuringly.
""OK.""
She smiled, ""Why don't you go talk to Jean? She's been waiting for you.""
Preston nodded.
Then he looked at me.
But it seemed he couldn't move his lips no matter what, and in the end, he said nothing.
The surgery team, having changed, walked over. ""Time for the surgery. Would the family mind stepping out of the way?""
The gurneys rolled forward.
At this moment, Camille couldn't help but be scared.
She reached out, calling out the name she had been inwardly murmuring all this time.
""Pres...""
""Don't be afraid.""
A bit late to hold her hand, Preston held the bed rail instead.
My gurney was ahead.
I looked at them, my gaze calm.
Then the operating room doors slowly closed.
Preston's upright figure was slowly sliced from my view.
I closed my eyes.
The moment before the surgery began, I heard Camille's voice.
""Thank you, Jean, for giving me your liver.""
The anesthetic entered my veins.
In that final moment before losing consciousness, I said softly, ""You're welcome.""
Chapter 4
I had a long, utterly numb dream.
It was the weirdest dream I had ever had.
My eyes seemed to be blindfolded.
Someone's voice echoed in the empty hallway.
""If you had known in advance that this life would be like this, would you still have chosen to come?""
I turned toward the source of the voice.
But I saw nothing, no one.
In a void, I saw an operating room.
In the doctor's office, the doctors were discussing.
""Remove that much liver? Seriously?""
""It states in the agreement—it'll only be seventy percent.""
""Gosh... With her liver being removed that much, can she ever recover?""
I listened, baffled.
I was alive, wasn't I?
Then how come I found my body drifting in the air?
I floated into the distance.
There was so much blood on the operating table.
I drifted away and overheard two nurses' voices.
""They're sisters. But their mother obviously favors the older one. She insists on removing that much of the younger one's liver.""
""And the younger sister is OK with that?""
""After she read the agreement, she gazed out the window and didn't say anything.
""She seemed so pitiful—I almost wanted to hug her.""
I didn't know where I was drifting to.
Four days later.
I opened my eyes slowly.
I couldn't feel my limbs at all.
All I could do was move my eyes slightly.
Everything I saw was pristine white.
""You're awake.""
A nurse leaned closer.
She smiled at me.
I nodded.
""Would you like some water? I'll feed it to you.""
""Thanks...""
She poured me a glass of water, slipped a straw into it, and held the straw to my lips.
I tried to take a sip.
But the slightest effort sent a sharp, tearing pain through my body.
""Hey, take it slow. Try not to use any strength,"" she said.
I managed a few small sips.
Then she pulled the glass away.
""My sister—""
""Camille Avery? She woke up yesterday. She's out of the ICU now.""
I felt a wave of relief and nodded slightly.
""Well..."" The nurse hesitated.
I looked up at her slowly.
She seemed to gather herself before asking, ""Are you two ... related by blood?""
I lowered my gaze.
""And that good-looking guy from the other day... Is he your husband? Or hers?""
Her eyes held a mix of curiosity and pity.
I had a rough idea of what must have happened while Camille and I were both here.
I didn't answer.
I just closed my eyes—my eyelids felt so heavy.
Two days later.
I was moved out of the ICU.
There still weren't any private rooms available.
I hired a caregiver through an app to pick up my prescriptions and handle errands for me.
Most of the time, I slept.
I was completely worn out, which didn't make sense.
I had been resting after surgery.
Logically speaking, I should have been getting stronger every day.
But I just felt drained, too tired to stay awake.
I didn't even have the energy to go home.
Still, I didn't want to take up a bed that someone else might need.
All I could do was hope I'd find the strength to leave soon.
Then one day, my mother came to see me.
She had brought soup.
My caregiver was just setting up the bedside table for my meal.
My mother asked her to step outside.
Then she opened the insulated container she'd brought and poured out a bowl of fragrant fish soup.
""Have some of this. It's much more nourishing than that,"" she said, glancing at the food the caregiver had prepared.
She kept her head down, avoiding my eyes.
It hit me then—she wasn't refusing to look at me. She just couldn't bear to.
Because I was now skin and bones.
My jawline was so sharp it could cut.
I reached for the spoon.
Her eyes drifted to my hand, covered in needle marks, swollen and bruised, and her eyelids fluttered slightly.
She took the spoon from me and picked up the bowl.
Then she lifted a spoonful of soup to my lips.
""Eat.""
I paused for a second.
Then I parted my lips and ate the soup from the spoon.
Spoonful after spoonful, she patiently helped me eat.
That afternoon, even the sunlight felt warm.
She sealed the container again, still not looking up.
She sat with me a little longer.
""Is there anything else you'd like to eat?""
I shook my head.
""I'm full.""
She nodded and stayed seated a while longer.
I noticed a strand of white in her hair at the temple.
It was probably from stress, from taking care of Camille in the hospital all this time.
""I should go,"" she said. ""I'll come by another day.""
I nodded.
As she walked past my bed, I couldn't help but be worried.
""Mom, is Cam doing better?""
She nodded.
""She's doing well. She's already been disch—""
She cut herself off, probably realizing she shouldn't have said it.
I was stunned.
Was Camille discharged?
My mother looked awkward.
But I just smiled.
""I'm glad to hear that.""
She nodded and left.
I watched her walk farther and farther away.
Suddenly, I felt anxious, desperate to keep her in sight a little longer. Pushing myself up, I struggled out of bed and made my way to the doorway.
I stared after her.
She never looked back.
Would she come here again?
I didn't think so.
But that was OK.
She didn't have to.
I'd be leaving soon anyway.
Before long, she disappeared from view.
Slowly, tears began to roll down my cheeks.
In that daze, I felt like that little girl again.
Once again, I was left behind at the amusement park.
I watched her walk farther and farther away, and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't catch up.
Chapter 5
No one knew about my past.
I went missing when I was three.
Then, at thirteen, I became part of the Avery family again.
I never talked about it—those ten years I was lost, the beatings, the tricks, everything I went through.
I thought things would get better once I was found again.
But they didn't. No one liked me.
They said they could see it in my eyes—how greedy and selfish I was, that I wasn't a good person.
Honestly, I didn't feel much when they said that.
What really broke me was finally knowing the truth.
I didn't go missing.
My mother had left me behind on purpose all those years ago.
""You want to be discharged?
""Absolutely not! You can't be serious.""
I kept my head down as the doctor spoke.
""I'm sorry,"" I said.
He scribbled his signature, tossed the paper back toward me, and continued on his rounds.
I went home.
Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, I let the sun warm me for a while.
Then I heard the lock twist behind me.
I turned around.
It was Preston.
Why was he back?
He walked over. ""Weren't you supposed to stay in the hospital a few more days?""
Today, he was wearing a light gray suit.
It softened his usual sharp, cold edge.
Though I wasn't sure why.
""I feel alright,"" I said.
""Alright? Have you looked in the mirror?""
His tone turned sharp all of a sudden.
I was stunned for a second. ""
How ... do I look?""
I rested a hand on my lower abdomen.
""Pres, do you remember when I was pregnant those two times? My stomach wasn't this flat. It was round.""
I smiled.
""Our first baby was six months along. My belly was like a soccer ball back then.
""And our second baby... I still believe it was a girl. She was so quiet, so well-behaved...""
Suddenly, Preston snapped, ""Stop.""
I lowered my head and fell silent.
Then I walked past him, noticing his hands were clenched and trembling.
I sat in the living room for a while.
Thumps and bumps came from the master bedroom.
When the sounds grew louder, I walked over.
Standing in the doorway, I saw him packing.
Was he taking all his things away?
""There's too much here to fit in one suitcase. Do you want me to call a moving company?""
I meant it kindly.
But his back stiffened, as if I'd startled him.
He stopped shoving things into the suitcase at random.
After a moment, he turned and looked at me.
""I'm not moving out. I'm packing because I have a business trip overseas.""
I paused.
A business trip? Was that all?
I nodded.
Then he went back to packing.
His movements were so rough, like he was taking out some kind of anger.
Leaning against the doorframe, I couldn't watch anymore.
I walked in.
""Let me help.""
He seemed a little surprised.
Then he put down what he was holding and stepped aside.
I started folding his clothes carefully.
He stood there, watching for a bit.
""I'll step out to return a call,"" he said.
When he came back in, he was stunned.
I had already finished packing everything.
""Does your wound hurt?"" he asked.
I let my hand drop from my waist.
""No,"" I said.
He glanced at me and pressed his lips together, seeming about to say something.
But he didn't.
As he closed the suitcase, he noticed the documents I'd placed inside.
""You put all my papers in here?""
He was about to take them out.
But I closed the lid.
""Bring them. You're going abroad—they might come in handy.""
Then I locked the suitcase with a soft click.
I nodded toward him.
""You should go. You don't want to miss your flight.""
With that, I turned to leave.
Suddenly, he grabbed my wrist from behind.
""Jeanne, I meant what I said. There's an issue with the project, and I have to be there to fix it myself. I'll be back in two weeks at the most.""",1,1767424191.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False
1q2o38w,https://www.reddit.com/r/matrix/comments/1q2o38w/matrix_resurrections_after_5_years/,Matrix Resurrections. After 5 years,"I'll be honest with you people, the movie it's not bad for the sake of being bad. It's bad because it purposely wants to be. This may be confusing, but I'll try to explain my points. My rating it's a 8/10. 

No.1: The movie is depressing.
 Pure, simply and direct. The first trilogy was about the fighting for free will in a system bound by binary programming. Free will being the choice of authenticity and humanity over programming. 
Which is why the trilogy originally has so much style, substance, it's visually impressive and, let's be frank, fucking awesome. 

Resurrections is literally about a system that uses your emotions, anxiety, depression and low self esteem against you, to keep you controlled. As soon as you see Neo in Resurrections, what is your first thought? ""That's not Neo."" 

You as the viewer are seeing this pathetic and honestly very crappy version of the ""One"", because that's how the system has forced him to be. Neo is coping with over 60 years of heavily inducted depression and anxiety. Anyone who suffers from it, know how difficult it is for you as a person to overthrow that.

Neo being awoken once more showed him the lie, and yet he still fails to reach who he was, sadly, because that Neo we knew basically died. 

Which is why the new group of characters use visual cues from the original trilogy, in trying to bring him back to his former self. ""You see? This was you.  "" Exactly what we are thinking while watching the movie. 

Why the action scenes, the colours and the visually impressive storytelling narrative the original trilogy had, it's not in this movie? Because again, this new Matrix uses depression as a tool for control. 

That whole empowerment stylized coolness the trilogy had it was to show you that you can break the system and be whoever you want to be. 
In Resurrections it's gone because the Analyst broke this spectrum. Being inside this new Matrix is boring, the movie tells you this when you see Neo being in the same routine all his life. Work, coffee, gym, shower, sleep, pills.
Which is why I absolutely think most people disliked the film, we were not expecting a depression study. We were expecting another ""Cool looking movie.""

It's not until the final shot, seeing Trinity and Neo fly again that we see a small glimpse of that ""awesomeness"" the trilogy had. 

No. 2: The movie is literally a ""Fuck you Warner Brothers"" into the most ironic and comically way possible. The original trilogy, regardless of how you feel about them, gave closure to the story. The Machines and Humans had peace and coexistence, which, we knew that's what the machines wanted in the first place, before humans went ballistic on them. Decades before the Matrix was created. I believe this movie, perfectly and indirectly explains how Lana Wachowski was feeling when WB told her to make the movie, or they would make it without her. The story was wrapped, it did not need a sequel. The movie is so meta that new Smith actually says this, and, it's so damn hilarious. 

Anyway. My point is. A movie first impression it's always the one that resonates the most in the audience, and when you movie it's deliberately making you to see a study of depression, oppression and anxiety, no wonder most people will dislike it. 

Honestly? I quite enjoyed the movie when it came out, and It still do. It's a tough cookie, sure, but that's the point of the movie. 

From my own personal view? It's a completely dick move from Lana Wachowski, which is why I considered to be bold, instead of using nostalgia bait, it's showing you a different system of control, and best part? A big ""Fuck you"" to WB, which will always be funny in its own way. ",1,1767424163.0,matrix,0,0.56,False

But if it does, I would like to try living in Italy or France, and I'm asking now since I wanna learn a new language, and I'm deciding between French and italian.

I have actually been to Italy (sicily specifically) and its was the best week of my life, I loved it, the scenery, coffee, people, food, and I wanted to learn italian and go back ever since, and I actually have an italian text book.

I've never been to France, apart from disneyland, but I've recently built up some sort of affinity for French culture and language, it seems quite laid back and I admire it for its 35 hour work week, and laid back approach to life/work. And from all the videos ive seen, it just seems like a lovely place to live, and its closer to the uk so i can get home easier. And maybe the culture would be similar? 

I actually moved to japan just expecting it to be nice tho, and although it is, it was different from what i expected, and i dont wanna live here long term, and i basically larned japanese for nothing (cool i know it tho i guess), so maybe making the same mistake with france would be a bad idea. But also a reason im not liking japan is becaue its so different to what im used to, and i wanna try living somewhere more familiar, which france seems like to me. Like a different culture, but not so different that im in culture shock all the time.

If anyone has lived in both, do you have any insight in which might be a better place to live short term, or which language is more fun, easier, better to know? ",0,1767424143.0,expats,8,0.4,False

1q2o1f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q2o1f8/face_off/,Face Off,"I saw the flyer stuck under my windshield wiper outside the 7-Eleven on Maple. White paper, red letters, the kind that screamed at you even when you didn’t want to read it.

ONE DAY REHABILITATION. ALL EXPENSES PAID. FIX YOURSELF OR DIE BROKEN.

I crumpled it without thinking and tossed it in the trash with my empty coffee cup when I got home. Late 80s or not, I wasn’t falling for some hippie cult garbage. I had places to be. People to disappoint.

Gary found it anyway.

My older brother had this habit of digging through trash when he got worried. Same way he used to check my pupils with a flashlight when we were kids, like he was already practicing to be my disappointed parent.

“You won’t amount to anything like this,” he said, holding the flyer like it was evidence in court. “You’re twenty six, Joel. You sleep on my couch. You don’t even try anymore.”

I told him to screw himself. Told him drugs weren’t the problem, life was. Same speech I always gave.

But he kept pushing. Rehab or you’re out. Rehab or don’t bother calling me again. Rehab or die alone, basically.

What got me was the fine print. All expenses paid. One day. Fix you completely.

One day sounded manageable. One free day. One free bed. One free meal. I told Gary I’d go just to shut him up.

The bus picked me up at dawn and drove north for hours. No radio. No driver small talk. Trees swallowed the road until even the sky felt thin. We stopped at a clearing where a cluster of canvas tents sat arranged in a circle, like a summer camp that forgot the campers.

A wooden sign read Ecstasis Rehabilitation Retreat.

Everyone smiled too hard.

They took my bag, my wallet, my watch. A woman in a beige sweater told me time was an illusion addicts clung to. She wrote my name down with a marker that smelled like rubbing alcohol.

My counselor met me at dusk.

He stood inside my tent, tall, breathing wet and heavy. At first I thought the light was wrong. Then I realized he didn’t have a face.

No skin. No nose. Just red muscle, yellow tendon, two staring eyes floating in the mess. Teeth exposed in a grin that never moved.

I screamed. Tried to bolt. Hands grabbed me from behind, gentle but unbreakable.

“Fear is the last drug,” the thing said. His voice was calm, practiced. “We remove it tonight.”
I don’t know why I didn’t die right there. Shock maybe. Curiosity. Or the way addicts will follow anything that promises relief.

He sat me down. Gave me a thick paste to smear across my cheeks and forehead. It burned cold. The counselors outside the tent began chanting in low voices, something old and rhythmic, like a heartbeat trying to remember itself.

My counselor leaned close. I could smell copper and something sweet, like rotting fruit.
“Ecstasy beyond chemicals,” he said. “True rehabilitation.”

When he touched my face, I felt pressure. Then release.

My skin peeled away like a glove.

I should have screamed. Instead I shuddered.

It was better than anything I’d ever taken. Better than coke, better than pills, better than the night I forgot my own name and felt free for the first time. Every nerve sang. Every thought melted. I wasn’t Joel anymore. I was pure sensation. Floating. Whole.

I slept smiling.

Morning light woke me.

I reached for my face and felt nothing. Just slick muscle and air.

Outside, counselors packed supplies. One of them walked past me, whistling. He had my face. My eyes. My crooked smile.

He paused and looked back.

“Ecstasy is a prison if you stay too long,” he said, adjusting my cheeks like they were loose gloves. “I needed a way out.”

I lunged for him. Hands grabbed me. Held me down. Other counselors surrounded me, all wearing different faces, all wrong.

“You’ll understand,” one said. “You’ll help others.”
They left me there with a mirror.

I screamed until my throat bled.

A week passed. Maybe more. Time was slippery without a face. They fed me. Taught me the chants. Taught me how to guide hands, how to soothe panic, how to promise heaven.

They told me it was my turn.

That night, someone new entered the tent.

Gary.

He froze when he saw me. Fell backward, shaking.

“What the hell is this,” he said. “This place is messed up. My brother would laugh his ass off at this. He probably never came. Probably went and got high again.”

His words hurt more than losing my skin. He regained composure and sat up.

He ranted. About his wife leaving. About drinking too much. About needing this to work so he could win her back.

I listened. Really listened.

When he finally looked at me, begging, I reached out.

“Trust me,” I said.

His face came off easily.

As he sat there basking in the ecstasy from his missing face, I pressed it to my own, I felt that high again.

That freedom.

I smiled at him with his own mouth.

It felt right.

After all, this place is about recovery.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

**The Gift of the Morning Pages**

Welcome to collectively create space to expand our creative dreams. Daily we will handwrite three 8” x 10” one sided pages; with thoughts, expressions, & emotions of how we feel & think, not how we should feel & think. This is an activity we will give priority first thing when we awaken. Take care of basic needs including coffee, nestle into your writing space, and honor the first 40 minutes of awakened time. According to Carl Jung, it takes time for our ego to awaken and provide defenses. This is the perfect time & opportunity to be moved into authenticity with ourselves. We are catching our consciousness before our safeguards arise. We show no one these pages, as this is our safe place to vent. Be prepared to review them after the first 8–9 weeks with awareness of boredom, highlighting the sparkles of ideas. Our daily thoughts do not follow a specified theme, only our thoughts, feelings, & reactions to events in a very raw light.

I know calories are almost irrelevant on carnivore but I’m struggling to think that I’m meeting my daily calories (possibly under eating) (I eat until I don’t feel hungry) I’m thinking that if I do end up losing weight primarily from a calorie deficit (it would be an accident) and getting off the diet and eating a regular amount of food, it would possibly add onto daily calorie intake which is of course how you gain weight (right?). Please let me know what you think and feel free to share any similar experiences ",0,1767423079.0,carnivorediet,1,0.5,False

Madison Frost I awoke to the sun warming my face. I opened my eyes and smiled. My mate, Scott Cypress, was standing by the window in his boxers, glancing down at the phone in his hands. I sat up on my elbow, “Why are you up so early?” I covered a yawn, eyeing the clock beside my bed. When he looked at me with his dimpled smile, my heart melted. It was the same smile as always, but it never gets old. Scott is the future alpha of the Cypress Ridge Pack. He turned twenty a few months back, and now his father is ready to hand the pack down to him. We’ve been together since my nineteenth birthday. That’s when werewolves can identify our fated mates. Being a gamma’s daughter, I was surprised when my wolf claimed the future alpha. He had all the women in the pack after his attention. We had grown up together, but I was never one to get my hopes up. My life has never turned out how I expected. “Baby, it’s still early. Go back to sleep,” he said. I reached out to him, “Only if you come back to bed.” He grinned, taking my hand, and he kissed it before sitting on the edge of the bed. “You know I would if I could, baby.” He leaned down and kissed my forehead. “Today is a big day,” he mumbled. It was the most important day of my life. Tonight, Scott would be named alpha, and he would claim me as his mate in front of the entire pack. Then we can finally mark each other. “Are you excited?” I asked him. He kissed my cheek, “You’ll officially be mine,” he purred, dragging his lips down my neck to my shoulder. I hummed in approval as my nails dug into his forearms. This loving, sexy, thoughtful man would be mine, and everyone would know who owns his heart. I groaned when his phone chimed. “I have to go, baby,” he grumbled, pushing me back with his lips against mine. This kiss was over too soon, and he was up, getting dressed. “Don’t pout, baby. I’ll see you tonight.” He leaned over me as I lay on my bed. I gave him my best puppy eyes as I gripped his shirt. He chuckled. “Soon.” He pecked my lips before I watched him leave my room. I threw my head back and sighed in satisfaction until my alarm went off. Now, it was time for me to get up and head to training. I showered and dressed before going downstairs to the kitchen. My father, Gamma Max Frost, was staring out the window above the sink. “Was that Alpha Scott sneaking out again this morning?” He grumbled. “Yes, Dad,” I exhaled, opening the fridge. “He’s my mate.” “So you say,” he mumbled. I took out the milk and closed the door. He was leaning against the counter with a mug of coffee. “I understand you’re worried, but after tonight, we will be official. Besides, he’s our alpha’s son. He’s a good guy,” I defended. He sighed before taking my hand. “You are my only child, Maddy. I want the best for you.” “I know, Dad.” I placed the milk down on the counter and hugged him. “I love you.” “Yeah. Yeah,” he muttered but squeezed me tightly. “Get going before you’re late.” I kissed his cheek before pouring some coffee and milk into a travel mug. Then I was out the door. I arrived just in time for roll-call. It would look bad for my father if the gamma’s daughter were late. Most of the time, I was early, unless Scott spent the night. “That was close,” the future Delta, Ryan, leaned in and whispered. I’ve known him all through my school years, and he is the closest person I can call a friend. In school, I wasn’t like the other girls. I wanted to make my father proud. He raised me to hunt and fish. I can track and survive in the wilderness on my own, with or without my wolf. I never wore dresses. Always sporting jeans, sneakers, and an old flannel shirt. My copper hair was always braided, and my face free of makeup. My father didn’t know how to teach me girlie things. I could have looked it up on the internet, but I never got around to it. I wore my first dress on my nineteenth birthday. Now, after tonight’s announcement, my life will change. I would be Scott’s Luna. Things would be expected of me. I was unsure I was ready, but my mate had assured me he would help me adjust to my new lifestyle. My mind raced as I ran the twenty-five kilometres. Then the obstacle course was next. I had run all of them so many times that I could do it with my eyes closed. Lastly, it was hand-to-hand combat. I excelled at all three as my gamma father taught me. When everyone else was done training for the day, he would push me to be the best. When I was ready to give up, he would always say, ‘I need to know you can protect yourself, my little wolf. I won’t always be around to take care of you.’ When training ended, I was winded as I sat on the field. “You’ve been quiet today,” Ryan panted as he leaned over with his hands on his knees. I shrugged. “Just not much to say.” He chuckled, giving me a pointed look. “You? Not much to say? Are you feeling alright?” I let out a mocking laugh. “You’re funny!” Someone called out to him, and he stood up, waving before turning back. “I’ll see you tonight?” “I’ll be there,” I smiled. Out of everyone here, I was closest to Ryan, but the other guys acknowledged me. I would get invited out to the bar, and sometimes I would accept. It was fun, but I was happy alone. He nodded before approaching his friends. I was the only woman who chose to enter training when the mandatory training had finished. Everyone in the pack was expected to know how to fight. You never knew when a rogue attack would occur, and everyone was responsible for protecting the elders and pups. When the training field was empty, I got up and went for a walk through the forest surrounding the arena. It was also the long way home. It was peaceful, and I was able to clear my head before heading home. Tonight, I would embrace the Moon Goddess’s plan, the fate she had handed me. I won’t let her or Scott down. I will be the best Luna and mate. I entered the empty house, knowing my father would be at the pack house. With the few hours I had before I had to get ready, I cleaned the house and did laundry. Soon, I would move in with Scott, but I would make time to care for my Dad. I was the only thing he had left of his mate. I couldn’t think of my mother without feeling a sense of guilt. I survived, and she didn’t. I pushed the feeling down and climbed the stairs to my room. Turning on some music, I prepared to shower. My wolf whimpered. “I know,” I sighed, turning on the shower. “I miss her too. It just hurts too much.” After taking a much-needed shower, I sat at my desk with the fluffy towel wrapped around me. I looked at myself in the mirror that hung above it. Now, it was time to turn myself into a Luna. I had bought some makeup and a hair dryer. Grabbing my phone, I looked up some tutorials for a style that would look best with the lavender sundress I had purchased. “What about this?” I asked my wolf. She nodded and gave me a toothy grin. “Let’s see if it’s as easy as she claims.” My wolf came to me when I was twelve—the average age for a werewolf. I had named her Topaz after her furry coat. She is beautiful, and she has been my best friend ever since. She might not talk back, but she listens. We are a team that works effortlessly together in training. Our shifting was flawless and put many wolves to shame. I struggled a bit, but when I was finished, I slipped into the dress. “What do you think?” She howled in satisfaction, and I giggled as I spun around. The makeup was neutral, but it allowed my natural beauty to shine through. The red lipstick complemented my fair skin well. The sales girl at the store knew her stuff, and I felt beautiful as I stared into the mirror. With an apron neckline, the fabric overlapped over my chest before flaring at my waist. The dress fell just below my knees. It was modest, but elegant. The salesperson at that store had been helpful to me. I felt thankful to everyone who helped me pull this off. I would have been lost without them. I glanced at the clock, and it was time to leave. My father took his truck this morning, so I had to walk the thirty minutes to the pack house. Not that I minded. I was used to walking everywhere. I was saving up to buy a vehicle. I sat on my bed and pulled on my new white sneakers. I was planning on wearing the wedged sandals I bought, but I didn’t trust myself to walk that far in them without breaking an ankle. Even without the heels, the look I was hoping for still worked. The shoes made me feel more like myself. Grabbing my small purse and phone, I left the house. I couldn’t stop smiling as I walked closer to the rest of my life. This was it, and soon I would have everything.",1,1767423072.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

As Dakota’ was Lying there in her bed wondering to herself about her world and the world in which she had grew up to know. Lying there as her hands said it all placing them on her face moaning to herself. 

“ Oh my god! Do I really want to do this? Do I even really want to get out of bed this morning”

But Just as the days first light was just about to tell her other wise as it began making its way through the bedroom window looking at her. Saying to her  

“ You know that you can do this, just keep telling yourself that you can do this”

But as Dakota sat up giving a moan and groan Telling everything around her “yeah! Just keep telling myself that I can do this”

As she looked around to a empty bedroom a bedroom that basically only saw her most of the time. Growing up in a world where she did not want to know hurt to know what the world outside of her house was like for her sometimes.

As she sat there looking out of her bedroom window looking to the sun as it shined right back at her. Leaving a frown on her face as she kept looking saying 

“Don’t look at me like that! Don’t try and tell me that today is a new day for me” 

Knowing that a new day was indeed here for her a day that she just did not want to even look at. Much less looking out her bedroom window looking at the morning sun at it shown into her bedroom. Looking to her as if it was Promising her that today was going to be different.

Leaving Dakota setting there just shaking her head Saying “Sure! Go ahead and promise away but I’m not falling for that today Like I’ve heard that one before! Tell me something that I haven’t already heard before!” 

Setting here in her bed Dakota’ knew that this day was just not going to be easy. As she then laid it back down placing her pillow over head moaning to herself saying “ Look! If you want to tell me something then tell me to stay in bed today! Just don’t do this to me! Not today!” 

But as the mornings sunlight was trying to tell her in its way, that there was a place still in this world in this life for her. As Dakota’ then set back up in her bed setting there looking out of the window. Screaming to herself 

“Another day! Another day of “I really can’t do this! I just can’t! Not today! No way! Just go away! Please just go away”

Setting there finding herself once again looking out her window to the morning sun asking herself.

“What has life got to give me today? Can you please tell me that Is there even a place here in this life for me? Omg! I’m just so not ready for today”

With her not knowing then that later on she would realize that there is a place in this life for her. But at the same time leaving her asking the question? 

“Then why isn’t there a place in this world in this life for everyone! Then can you or someone please explain to me why or not! I am so not ready for this today”

Thinking to herself as she continued to look out of her window just as the sun’s light glimmered once again. Glimmering its light through and around the branches of the tree that stood just outside of her window. Watching as the wind would blow through its leaves just as the sun was trying to tell me yet again. Trying to tell her that today was going to be different. With Dakota’ now saying

 “Okay! You win! Really you win! Yay I’m getting up happy now! Because I’m not! But that doesn’t mean that I have to like it”

Making her way slowly out of bed saying to herself 

“Man! I’m really feeling like the world’s oldest 30 something year old woman dam I’m old! Can I just please just die now? Please I really feel like I’m already in hell or dam near close to being there”

But just as that thought left her leaving her standing there running her fingers through her morning messed up hair. Leaving her to moaning and groaning some more as she said 

“Really! If my hair is going to be this messy then! Ohhh I’m not only old but the definition, of a single 30 something with messed up morning hair. God I just love my love life singe with no one to mess up my hair Great! Good going Dakota you have now entered into your thirty’s being the 30 year old never even been a bridesmaid”

But the not so quietness of the morning with Dakota still playing around with her morning messed up hair. Was now so rudely being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids.  Walking by her window leaving Dakota with the feeling of 

“Yeah just keep walking on by as you get a good look at a 30 year old messing up her own hair cause old and lonely here can’t seem to oh just forget it”

“I mean really do I need to keep looking at the single ads saying hey! Look at me I can mess up your hair for you! Yeah sure buddy you just keep biking down that road on your mountain bike there. Please tell me when the real ads or abs come into view”

But as everyone was making their way to work or school leaving Dakota’ then saying! 

“Oh come on! Can’t you kids be any louder! Omg! I’m now starting to sound like my mother”

With Dakota’ standing there in her pajamas and messed up hair looking out seeing and hearing the people make their way by. Knowing that the sounds was just not going away anytime soon as she Slowly but surely made her way to the bathroom standing there in front of the mirror looking. As Dakota’ then said 

“Jesus! I’m just so not ready for today! Or any day to be precise Jesus! If you are up there listening! I’m going to all the help that I can get today! If you are listening! Listening to a 30 something year old girl with messed up hair Standing here and complaining Yeah! like my everyday complaining!” 

Standing there running her hand back through her usual messed up blonde hair. Standing there looking into the mirror, looking at a blonde haired blue eyed girl! thinking to herself 

“Oh yeah! I am sure ready for today!” As Dakota’ stood there messing up her hair even more Saying to herself

“ Yeah! This girl is certainly going places Just not today I mean what more could a blue eyed girl do to get through yet another day. Or at least mess up my hair for me” 

As Dakota’ just stood there screaming into the mirror pulling her hair in every direction Except where she wanted it to go saying to herself

 “Oh yeah another day of let’s see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself”

standing there in the bathroom now trying to put her clothes on “Really! Oh come on!” 

“Oh my God! One pants leg at a time! Jesus! I swear my ass is just too? Really! I’m thinking that! I’m really thinking about just stripping everything off and just!” Oh my God my ass is just too? I really need to get a grip of things here” Screaming as she finally finished putting her clothes on asking herself yet again!

“ Do I really want to do this? Do I really want this day to even be here” 

With Dakota’ now making her way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker saying to herself 

“Oh yeah! Just what Dakota’ needed this morning my cup of hot Joe!” Yeah that hits the spot”

With her not really knowing where to start or hell even where to begin! But first things first! Her Coffee for she just wasn’t doing nothing or anything or? until she has had her first mornings coffee. With Dakota’ now settling down at the kitchen table looking at the mornings newspaper along with her coffee. 

Saying to herself! “Well! Let’s see what is happening in the world today who is here and who is not. Oh look here let’s see who single and looking, never mind Just keep on biking dude like really! Is it my ass? I mean! Oh my God I’m now feeling of my own ass I mean I already mess up my own hair why the hell not then”

Setting there as she flipped through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what else the world may have to look forward to. Throwing the newspaper to the side thinking to herself saying 

“ Nothing! Nothing here Nothing else is happening I guess! I mean is there anything left in this Life.” Thinking to herself was there any faith left in her at all

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing her things before heading out the door. She then noticed that her coat was still hanging in the closet. Saying to herself in the process. 

“I swear if my head wasn’t attached to me!” dropping her purse back onto the kitchen table. Saying to herself! 

“My head would still in the bed asleep with its messed up hair it if we’re not attached to me” 

Doing a complete 180 making her way back into her room opening up her closet door reaching for it screaming 

“Oh my God! Now where in the hell is it!”

And that was when she then noticed a box setting there in the corner, from just out of shear curiosity she then reached it grabbing it. Now trying to get her own self from out of the closet saying to herself in the process. 

“ Omg! Jesus! I swear this closet is going to be the end of me yet!”

Walking back into the kitchen holding the while dragging her coat along with her placing both of them down onto the kitchen table. Not knowing of what she would even find in it as she set down ready to open this bad boy up. And with a look of what is this? And then the Memories, Memories that would bring her to rediscovering a past in her life. A past that would bring her to finding something that was missing from her life. 

 Dakota’ just didn’t realize it at the moment that It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter. With one of the photos being of her mom setting there looking to the photo of her mom. With Dakota’ knowing that she was not always very close to her mom. But  it would still bring a tear her eyes

But It didn’t seem to make her day any better at the moment Knowing that for today had marked ten years since her mom had passed away. And with her going to visit her grave today it just didn’t make it easier. Seeing that photo of her mom as Dakota’ then picked up another photo as the memories of yesterday hit her even harder. As she continued to look closely at the photo of Dakota Looking at a younger her. a young Girl of around 12 years of age with her short blonde hair standing there next to her mother.

 Who was very much identical to her along in the photo setting there beside her was her dog a dog who was named Buddy. Thinking back she remembered the good times that they had with her dog buddy. But not all of it was good time but for most teens you just don’t realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when Dakota’ found the letter, a letter that she had not seen before today. Setting there thinking to herself that reading it would not make her day any easier. But read it she did! for the letter read as this, 

“. To my lovely Daughter Dakota’ I am writing this letter to you for when you get older you will realize that the hard times and the good times that we had shared together.”

“For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl! my little Dakota! knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself”

“That no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 

Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found that day! think back! Back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer on what you found, on what Life had brought to you that summer! just before your teenage Life was just about to begin. 

For when you find it again you just know that as your mother a place I have found! A place that i hope you will find too. Knowing that the people you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.”

Reading that then sent Dakota’s mind racing, Racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring back to her! But little did Dakota’ know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that she would have never knew. For someone it would bring her to that day.

As Dakota’ set there remembering back! Remembering It was early that morning when she had got up. not wanting to get out bed Sounds familiar! Very familiar to her just as her dog buddy would then come running jumping up onto Dakota’s bed licking her face making himself known in his way. 

Of telling Dakota’ that was his way of saying to her in the only way that her little buddy could do. Letting her know that another day was here another day of exploring together. to find themselves wondering out into a world that only their imagination could take them.

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as Dakota’ got out of bed walking into the kitchen as her mom was making breakfast. Saying to her

“Now what would my little Dakota’ like this morning!” As Dakota’s mom then looked to buddy saying! “Oh and what would a good little boy like yourself like “Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying 

“ maybe later I’m not hungry right now” 

for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying 

“Honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!” 

jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying 

“ look mom not now I just want to just go! So look I will be back later” 

Making my way out the door as looking back at my mom saying 

“ look I will be back later till then just chilling okay!” 

Walking out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret! Regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me! A journey that would in time change my Life forever, forever in a way that I was soon to find out. Setting there on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself

 “what else is out there? What else is out there for us buddy!” I mean What else was there for me in this life.” Looking down to buddy saying to him 

“ let’s go and find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here” 

With that I stood up saying to buddy

 “ let’s go! Let’s do this! Let’s see for ourselves what else is out there” 

walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line thinking to myself “once I do this there is no turning back. There is only the road ahead of us!” Jumping the fence me and buddy then made our way to the road with my house now out of sight. I knew now that from this point on that we were on our own on our way.

And with that we were on our way and on our own “Okay so I already mentioned that we were on our own now but To where was the question now. But as of where that I just did not know but we sure were going to find out when got there

As we walked down the dirt road a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road. Seeing a red farm truck parked there. Parked on the side other side of the gas station kinda away from everyone quickly grabbing buddy running up to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

As me and buddy lay there! Down inside the back of the pickup making sure that know one saw us. Thinking to herself 

“Yeah me and buddy where on our way on our way to where? Well we were about to find out!” As we lay there in the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner. Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over quickly covering myself and buddy up. As we both lay there. Trying my best making sure that buddy wasn’t going to be buddy! And start barking

Letting half of the world know that we were there! For it wasn’t long till I then heard the owner getting back into the truck Quickly making sure that no one noticed us. With him now Pulling out of the gas station as I then looked to buddy saying

“Woohoo we are on our way now!”

Feeling the wind as it hit up against the blanket laying there as we made our way down the road. It wasn’t until about fifteen minutes later! uncovering myself and buddy making sure that buddy wasn’t going to be quiet! setting up looking out into the empty fields as we passed by them. Feeling the freedom of the wind making our way down the road. At the same time making sure that the driver didn’t see us.  

For our little adventure would have ended very quickly! Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing! Saying to him with a smile 

“ Look! I know what you would say if you could talk! But  I know what I am doing! Really!”

looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road. I thought to myself

“what were we going to do when we got there? Where were we going to go?” 

About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us. With the driver now pulling into the parking lot of the grocery store. Quickly lying back down covering myself and buddy back up Lying there waiting once again making sure that buddy was not going to be buddy! “Now remember no barking!” 

With me now hearing the truck door open as the driver then got out. Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear. Double checking! Looking all around before uncovering myself and buddy Quickly double checking with buddy.

“You think it’s clear now! You sure it’s clear!” As buddy then just bark at me okay”

With me looking to him saying to him “Hey I know what I’m doing okay! Got it! Good! Now let’s go!” making our way from the truck not looking back until we were far enough away. Looking out across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 As we then walked from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk. As people would pass us by! Not paying any real attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves until we then came across a gentleman. He was just setting there on a bench in front of a the convenient store whittling away on a piece of wood. Just as he then Look up at me saying 

“Well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you” 

Saying back to him 

“Thank you his name is buddy my mom got him from the pound” 

Smiling back to me! He then asked me saying 

“So where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask”

Replying back to him I said to him 

“Just seeing what a girl and her dog could find on our way on our little adventure finding out what life has for us”

Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us 

“ finding yourself on an adventure why aren’t you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you”? 

“Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for. And then when are old enough you can go all of the adventures you like”

“Then maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.” 

As he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying with him. A drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

“ Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today and think about your Life and sleep on it. And when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know for when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way“

“But just know this little one! The memories that you make as a child! Are the memories that will keep you going. When this little thing that we adults like to call life! When Life just steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep.“ 

thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy then made our way down the street I didn’t know then what he said as I would later in my Life what he meant.

As the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We then came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on us we decided to make camp there for the night Just. Having no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself! Thinking about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I lay there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As lay there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would then fall to sleep. For that night finding myself dreaming, Dreaming of myself and buddy with the two of us being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. 

“ You may not know of your Life right now but somewhere someone out there someone has a plan for you in this Life”.

 “For everyone that you meet in this Life! Will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or in your memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life” 

As I then Dreamed! I then Dreamed of mom. And In my dream she was crying, crying for me to come home. saying to me 

“ please Dakota’ just come home wherever you are, please just come back to me” 

With me and buddy waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

With me and buddy now making our way across the field thinking about the journey ahead! The journey would take us to where we were going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was. We only knew that we were on our way with me looking down to buddy asking him! “Tell me buddy where are we going?”

Just as buddy just barked at me with us now spending most of the day keeping in the field. Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road. Looking around I could see an individual standing there in a field across the road in another field. He was just standing there not really knowing on why he was just standing there at the moment. But soon I was going to find out.

Thinking to myself we could just sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up to the truck climbing over the tailgate before the individual saw us. It wasn’t maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. 

Lying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we were going. Lying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as lay there watching the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. 

I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in this Life. A place that I knew I belonged there! But till then as I lay there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by looking to buddy saying 

“We are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in this Life.”

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves lying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky just coming into view. Just as we made our way down the highway thirsty and hungry I felt lying there in the bed of pickup. For I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as we passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world. A world that I was not for sure off. A world that just seemed distant  A world that in time I would come to know that this was my life. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. 

A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her.

“Wait mom Please come back please wherever you are going”

Turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying 

“ I love you Dakota, I love you wherever your are but just know this that someday that I will be gone from you”

With tears in Dakota’s eyes thinking to herself 

“What have I done? Mom wherever you are I promise that I will return soon I promise you”

Just then as Dakota suddenly woke up realizing that she was still in the bed of the pickup feeling the truck as it was pulling in somewhere. Lying there looking up to the sky above her hearing the truck door open up. Looking over to buddy lying there waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

Lying there as she then whispered to buddy 

“Don’t look at me like that I know what I’m doing”

As Dakota then slowly started to peek her head out over the bed of the truck just as the man walked into his house. Leaving Dakota a smiling as she looked to buddy motioning him come as they both jumped down from the truck. Making their way towards the back of house looking around just as she then saw a boy about the same age as her. 

Setting there on a swing as he then looked towards to Dakota and buddy as he then greeted them

“Hello who are you” 

As Dakota now startled as she looked towards the boy before replying to him saying 

“ I am Dakota and what is your name” 

As he then just looked to her saying 

“My name is Billy” 

As Dakota then walked closer to him with Dakota asking him if everything was all right as he replied to her saying 

“The Doctors told my mom and dad that I was sick and that it may take awhile for me to get better” 

But Just then as Dakota was talking to him buddy then came running jumping up onto the swing with him. As Dakota then told buddy to get down as billy then said with a smile 

“ its okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?” With buddy barking to him giving him a lick on his face”

With Dakota replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we was sort of found ourselves on a little journey of sorts. As Billy just looked to Dakota with a smile as billy then said to her

“A journey! Man! I would love very much to go on a journey a real journey you say! I could only imagine a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here being sick”

Looking to Billy Dakota then said to him 

“Then maybe one day you will find yourself on a journey, maybe you me and buddy could go on a journey together.”

As Dakota then looked towards buddy with a smile as she then turned back towards Billy saying to him

“Let’s do it then! Let’s go on a journey together you me and buddy”

As Billy then looked to Dakota with a smile 

“Really! Man that would be great going on a journey I would love nothing more than to find myself on an adventure”

With Billy just looking at Dakota as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled saying 

“ I want to so badly to find my place in this Life I just want to get up from here and go live my Life. But hearing it in my mom and dad’s voice I can hear them saying that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life”

As Dakota then gave him a smile as she said to him “Then let’s do it, let’s go on an adventure that we shall never forget”

Leaving Billy setting there as he looked back to Dakota smiling back to her as he was ready to just get and go. To set off on an adventure an adventure that he had yearned for his entire life at least from when he could remember.

As Billy then gave a Quick Look to Dakota letting her know that he would be right back slowly making his way into his house. As he gave a Quick Look around to make sure that no one was around. Making his way to his bedroom grabbing his backpack as he then quickly made his way into the kitchen filling up two canteens with water. As he then grabbed a couple of snacks along with a few dog biscuits before making his way back outside to Dakota and buddy.

And with a smile to each other they set off into the field just behind Billy’s house as buddy then started barking to Dakota. With Dakota only giving him a look before saying 

“Now don’t you worry I know what I am doing now are you coming with us or what”

As Dakota and Billy made their way through the field down a fence line before coming to end of the field. As they both then just looked at the dirt road knowing that once they crossed it that they would be on their way. With Billy having never been this far from his home on his own before looked over at Dakota before saying to her

“It’s now or never, once I cross this fence then I will have officially been as far as I have ever been on my own”

As Dakota then placed her hand on his shoulder giving him look then a smile before saying to him

“You not alone me and buddy are here with you”

And with that they were on their way as Dakota was thinking to herself “Mom I know that I promised that I would return and i will I promise”

As the sun then begun to set they had made their way through a couple of more fields with both of them deciding to go ahead and make camp their for tonight. With neither one of them really knowing of exactly where they were going with them only knowing that they were on our way. 

With night now falling leaving them setting there up underneath a starlit sky having ate some of snacks that Billy had packed. As Billy then looked over to Dakota asking her

“Where do you think that we will up at?”

As Dakota then looked back at him saying 

“I don’t know I’m not for sure yet me and buddy have kinda of just winging it”

As Dakota then looked over to Billy saying to him

“So where do you want this journey to take us”

With Billy kinda of just looking towards the ground before saying to her

 “I just want to get better so I can find my place in this life”

With each of them giving a smile to each other as they lay there looking up to the stars with buddy in between them. With neither one them unaware that the news station have been running a story of a missing Dakota. As they continued to talk to each other into the night before falling asleep. 

And with the morning sunrise finding Dakota and Billy once again making their way through more fields. As they continued to talk about what all that they might find and see on their journey with this being the first camp out for Billy as he was now looking forward to more. 

Just as they then came upon another dirt road as they made their way down it for a bit before coming upon a pickup truck. As they then quickly made their way up and into the bed of the pickup. Making sure that no one noticed them before covering themselves up with a tarp that was lying there. As a few moments had passed before they heard someone getting into and starting up the truck. 

And as they made their way down the road lying there looking up to the sky as Billy looked over to Dakota. Reaching for her hand as they smiled at each other as they looked up to the sky as the clouds passed by them. Unaware that a search was well underway for both of them with no one knowing that they were together. 

As Billy then looked to Dakota saying to her

“Man I hope this goes on forever”. As the both of them looked once more to the sky holding each other’s hand as they made their way down the road. With a couple of hours now passing but to them time was standing still for them as the truck had come to a stop. Knowing that they would have to be careful about making their way down from the truck bed without being noticed.

But as the day went on now once again finding themselves in another field resting with Billy now realizing that he wasn’t able to go any further that day. As he looked to Dakota saying to her

“Hold up a minute I’m going to have to rest a bit before we go any further” 

And with him and Dakota setting there looking out over across the field as Billy then looked over to Dakota saying to her.

“Man why do I have to sick I just want to finish our journey together”

As Dakota then placed her arm around Billy saying to him

“Let’s just rest here for now before we go any further” 

But before they could say anything else a helicopter then flew over them a helicopter that had been searching for them. Unaware that they were together as the local authorities had made their way to them. Having taken them to the local Hospital to get Billy checked on Just then as Billy’s dad would come into his room looking to Dakota saying to her that it was time, time for her to head home. Looking back to Billy before she had left saying to him 

“ I hope that one day that you will get better and just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on another adventure together” 

As Billy then gave buddy one last hug looking at him smiling petting him one last time before Dakota and buddy made their way out of the room. To where the authorities were waiting there to take her and buddy back home.

 As they then made our way back home from their little journey pulling back into the drive way. Finding themselves now back at Dakota’s farm. Dakota could see her mom as she came running out to her. Quickly Grabbing her hugging her tightly crying as she said 

“Don’t you ever leave me again Dakota! Don’t you ever leave like that again me again” 

hugging her mom saying 

 “I promise mom I will never leave you again” 

But as the days went on and a year had come and gone Dakota would set there thinking about billy’ and Journey that me and buddy had went on that day. Thinking to herself settling there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside her. Looking out into the opened field in front of her Just as her mom would come out on the front porch setting down next her. As she then placed her arms around Dakota with tears in her eyes 

 Telling her that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy, that he had passed away this morning. With tears in Dakota’s eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Saying to her mom

“Why! Billy’ can’t die! He was going to get better so me him and buddy could go on another journey together”

But Just knowing that her mom was setting there with her giving me a hug saying to her

“Honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.” 

For the rest of that evening Dakota and her mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another. Talking about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that they did talk with one another, for it was not until Dakota got older that then that she would realize on how much her mom meant to her.

Looking back now thinking to herself setting there in the kitchen holding her mom’s letter that she had written. A letter for to her know that later in her to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that she had met on her journey with buddy that day and that he was right. When he told her that the memories that we make during our childhood are the memories that help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as Dakota stood there at her mom’s grave she thought to herself thinking of her mom. Thinking about Billy’ so many years ago what he said to her for there was a place for him in this life. And for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dad’s memories and in their hearts. 

For the little time that Dakota had knew him she had always thought of him in Life and in memories. Memories that he left behind for her to appreciate the Life that she had For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. 

As Dakota then looked to the sky and said 

“There is a place for you Billy and that place will always be in my heart and until that day when we will meet again. I will know that you will keep a place for me their in Heaven”",1,1767423071.0,u_ResourceAmazing5438,0,1.0,False

Madison Frost I awoke to the sun warming my face. I opened my eyes and smiled. My mate, Scott Cypress, was standing by the window in his boxers, glancing down at the phone in his hands. I sat up on my elbow, “Why are you up so early?” I covered a yawn, eyeing the clock beside my bed. When he looked at me with his dimpled smile, my heart melted. It was the same smile as always, but it never gets old. Scott is the future alpha of the Cypress Ridge Pack. He turned twenty a few months back, and now his father is ready to hand the pack down to him. We’ve been together since my nineteenth birthday. That’s when werewolves can identify our fated mates. Being a gamma’s daughter, I was surprised when my wolf claimed the future alpha. He had all the women in the pack after his attention. We had grown up together, but I was never one to get my hopes up. My life has never turned out how I expected. “Baby, it’s still early. Go back to sleep,” he said. I reached out to him, “Only if you come back to bed.” He grinned, taking my hand, and he kissed it before sitting on the edge of the bed. “You know I would if I could, baby.” He leaned down and kissed my forehead. “Today is a big day,” he mumbled. It was the most important day of my life. Tonight, Scott would be named alpha, and he would claim me as his mate in front of the entire pack. Then we can finally mark each other. “Are you excited?” I asked him. He kissed my cheek, “You’ll officially be mine,” he purred, dragging his lips down my neck to my shoulder. I hummed in approval as my nails dug into his forearms. This loving, sexy, thoughtful man would be mine, and everyone would know who owns his heart. I groaned when his phone chimed. “I have to go, baby,” he grumbled, pushing me back with his lips against mine. This kiss was over too soon, and he was up, getting dressed. “Don’t pout, baby. I’ll see you tonight.” He leaned over me as I lay on my bed. I gave him my best puppy eyes as I gripped his shirt. He chuckled. “Soon.” He pecked my lips before I watched him leave my room. I threw my head back and sighed in satisfaction until my alarm went off. Now, it was time for me to get up and head to training. I showered and dressed before going downstairs to the kitchen. My father, Gamma Max Frost, was staring out the window above the sink. “Was that Alpha Scott sneaking out again this morning?” He grumbled. “Yes, Dad,” I exhaled, opening the fridge. “He’s my mate.” “So you say,” he mumbled. I took out the milk and closed the door. He was leaning against the counter with a mug of coffee. “I understand you’re worried, but after tonight, we will be official. Besides, he’s our alpha’s son. He’s a good guy,” I defended. He sighed before taking my hand. “You are my only child, Maddy. I want the best for you.” “I know, Dad.” I placed the milk down on the counter and hugged him. “I love you.” “Yeah. Yeah,” he muttered but squeezed me tightly. “Get going before you’re late.” I kissed his cheek before pouring some coffee and milk into a travel mug. Then I was out the door. I arrived just in time for roll-call. It would look bad for my father if the gamma’s daughter were late. Most of the time, I was early, unless Scott spent the night. “That was close,” the future Delta, Ryan, leaned in and whispered. I’ve known him all through my school years, and he is the closest person I can call a friend. In school, I wasn’t like the other girls. I wanted to make my father proud. He raised me to hunt and fish. I can track and survive in the wilderness on my own, with or without my wolf. I never wore dresses. Always sporting jeans, sneakers, and an old flannel shirt. My copper hair was always braided, and my face free of makeup. My father didn’t know how to teach me girlie things. I could have looked it up on the internet, but I never got around to it. I wore my first dress on my nineteenth birthday. Now, after tonight’s announcement, my life will change. I would be Scott’s Luna. Things would be expected of me. I was unsure I was ready, but my mate had assured me he would help me adjust to my new lifestyle. My mind raced as I ran the twenty-five kilometres. Then the obstacle course was next. I had run all of them so many times that I could do it with my eyes closed. Lastly, it was hand-to-hand combat. I excelled at all three as my gamma father taught me. When everyone else was done training for the day, he would push me to be the best. When I was ready to give up, he would always say, ‘I need to know you can protect yourself, my little wolf. I won’t always be around to take care of you.’ When training ended, I was winded as I sat on the field. “You’ve been quiet today,” Ryan panted as he leaned over with his hands on his knees. I shrugged. “Just not much to say.” He chuckled, giving me a pointed look. “You? Not much to say? Are you feeling alright?” I let out a mocking laugh. “You’re funny!” Someone called out to him, and he stood up, waving before turning back. “I’ll see you tonight?” “I’ll be there,” I smiled. Out of everyone here, I was closest to Ryan, but the other guys acknowledged me. I would get invited out to the bar, and sometimes I would accept. It was fun, but I was happy alone. He nodded before approaching his friends. I was the only woman who chose to enter training when the mandatory training had finished. Everyone in the pack was expected to know how to fight. You never knew when a rogue attack would occur, and everyone was responsible for protecting the elders and pups. When the training field was empty, I got up and went for a walk through the forest surrounding the arena. It was also the long way home. It was peaceful, and I was able to clear my head before heading home. Tonight, I would embrace the Moon Goddess’s plan, the fate she had handed me. I won’t let her or Scott down. I will be the best Luna and mate. I entered the empty house, knowing my father would be at the pack house. With the few hours I had before I had to get ready, I cleaned the house and did laundry. Soon, I would move in with Scott, but I would make time to care for my Dad. I was the only thing he had left of his mate. I couldn’t think of my mother without feeling a sense of guilt. I survived, and she didn’t. I pushed the feeling down and climbed the stairs to my room. Turning on some music, I prepared to shower. My wolf whimpered. “I know,” I sighed, turning on the shower. “I miss her too. It just hurts too much.” After taking a much-needed shower, I sat at my desk with the fluffy towel wrapped around me. I looked at myself in the mirror that hung above it. Now, it was time to turn myself into a Luna. I had bought some makeup and a hair dryer. Grabbing my phone, I looked up some tutorials for a style that would look best with the lavender sundress I had purchased. “What about this?” I asked my wolf. She nodded and gave me a toothy grin. “Let’s see if it’s as easy as she claims.” My wolf came to me when I was twelve—the average age for a werewolf. I had named her Topaz after her furry coat. She is beautiful, and she has been my best friend ever since. She might not talk back, but she listens. We are a team that works effortlessly together in training. Our shifting was flawless and put many wolves to shame. I struggled a bit, but when I was finished, I slipped into the dress. “What do you think?” She howled in satisfaction, and I giggled as I spun around. The makeup was neutral, but it allowed my natural beauty to shine through. The red lipstick complemented my fair skin well. The sales girl at the store knew her stuff, and I felt beautiful as I stared into the mirror. With an apron neckline, the fabric overlapped over my chest before flaring at my waist. The dress fell just below my knees. It was modest, but elegant. The salesperson at that store had been helpful to me. I felt thankful to everyone who helped me pull this off. I would have been lost without them. I glanced at the clock, and it was time to leave. My father took his truck this morning, so I had to walk the thirty minutes to the pack house. Not that I minded. I was used to walking everywhere. I was saving up to buy a vehicle. I sat on my bed and pulled on my new white sneakers. I was planning on wearing the wedged sandals I bought, but I didn’t trust myself to walk that far in them without breaking an ankle. Even without the heels, the look I was hoping for still worked. The shoes made me feel more like myself. Grabbing my small purse and phone, I left the house. I couldn’t stop smiling as I walked closer to the rest of my life.

I looked at myself in the mirror that hung above it. Now, it was time to turn myself into a Luna. I had bought some makeup and a hair dryer. Grabbing my phone, I looked up some tutorials for a style that would look best with the lavender sundress I had purchased. “What about this?” I asked my wolf. She nodded and gave me a toothy grin. “Let’s see if it’s as easy as she claims.” My wolf came to me when I was twelve—the average age for a werewolf. I had named her Topaz after her furry coat. She is beautiful, and she has been my best friend ever since. She might not talk back, but she listens. We are a team that works effortlessly together in training. Our shifting was flawless and put many wolves to shame. I struggled a bit, but when I was finished, I slipped into the dress. “What do you think?” She howled in satisfaction, and I giggled as I spun around. The makeup was neutral, but it allowed my natural beauty to shine through. The red lipstick complemented my fair skin well. The sales girl at the store knew her stuff, and I felt beautiful as I stared into the mirror. With an apron neckline, the fabric overlapped over my chest before flaring at my waist. The dress fell just below my knees. It was modest, but elegant. The salesperson at that store had been helpful to me. I felt thankful to everyone who helped me pull this off. I would have been lost without them. I glanced at the clock, and it was time to leave. My father took his truck this morning, so I had to walk the thirty minutes to the pack house. Not that I minded. I was used to walking everywhere. I was saving up to buy a vehicle. I sat on my bed and pulled on my new white sneakers. I was planning on wearing the wedged sandals I bought, but I didn’t trust myself to walk that far in them without breaking an ankle. Even without the heels, the look I was hoping for still worked. The shoes made me feel more like myself. Grabbing my small purse and phone, I left the house. I couldn’t stop smiling as I walked closer to the rest of my life. This was it, and soon I would have everything.",1,1767422913.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Or even if he were to propose a date after just a few hours of talking, at least we should talk a bit about us. Small things like hobbies, expectations, career, job, views on society, whatever he wants kids or not (not everyone puts it on their profile).

I had been in a 8 years old relationship, my first and only. I feel so much anxiety around dating someone new. I mean I look at the profile and think... do I see myself getting intimidate with this person? And then anxiety is even higher and I tend to chicken out. How to relax and not think that far?

1q2nk5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q2nk5t/unsure_how_to_handle_roommate_crossing_boundaries/,Unsure how to handle roommate crossing boundaries while maintaining friendship,"Howdy y’all, apologies for long post in advance. I made this throwaway acct to help out a friend get some advice for a tricky situation they need help navigating. For context one of my close friends, Roxy, moved in with a friend of theirs, who I’ll call Paige, from uni in early 2025, after their housing situation with family fell through (they’re NC with them now). From what I know, everything seemed to be going smoothly until yesterday when Roxy and I were catching up and they were expressing frustration over how things were like living with Paige, namely with her not respecting boundaries.   
  
Some additional context about the situation: Roxy and I are still in uni (we live in different cities), with Roxy working some truly insane hours on the side to be able to pay rent, tuition and other expenses. Paige works a part time job(she graduated about a year ago I think) and relies on Roxy for transportation for her job and groceries, as she doesn’t drive. Because Roxy and I are in our early 20s and Paige is almost 30, Paige will often treat or make jokes that Roxy is like her kid or younger sibling (this’ll come up later).   
  
Roxy started dating this guy a few weeks ago, who they’re taking things slow with because of having gotten out of a shitty relationship just a few months prior, which Paige knows. A few weeks ago however, they had brought their bf over just to cuddle and make out in their room privately, they were interrupted repeatedly by Paige coming into their room to show them stuff. Paige also ended up sidetracking their date in the middle when she had Roxy go get ingredients for some comfort food for her because she sprained something. The whole experience of having their date usurped, not to mention that this was the first time that their bf was meeting Paige and that didnt exactly leave a good impression, Roxy asked Paige to please not interrupt their dates like that if they brought their bf home. Paige apologized at the time and agreed to not do anything like that again.

Just 2 days ago, Roxy had again made plans with their bf to stay home and cuddle in their room (with the door locked this time). Paige was aware of this in advance, saying that she would be busy on New Year’s so it didn’t matter. However, the same thing happened again, this time because Paige wanted to go and get coffee or something, and did in fact, not have New Year’s plans, and wanted to go along when Roxy was driving to drop off bf at his place. Roxy shut it down saying that they and their bf were already uncomfortable with it, and that they had told Paige in advance about their date. Paige got pissed at Roxy and was yelling at them over text essentially about how they were never available and just seemed mad that Roxy had plans without them on New Years. It is worth noting that Roxy and Paige had celebrated multiple other holidays together this year at their apartment.

This really irked Roxy, because it seems like their boundaries are always being pushed off by Paige, and that they aren’t always treated seriously because they’re younger (despite imo, having much more responsibilities). Also, besides when Roxy had their bf over, Paige will still often burst into Roxy’s room unannounced to show them something or ask for something, despite Roxy telling them not to several times. Roxy has attempted to lock their door for privacy so that it doesn’t happen, but all that seems to do is piss Paige off, and since they’re still friends, Roxy’s stopped doing it for the most part. On top of all of this another point of contention is that the two times that Paige, Roxy and their boyfriend have interacted, Paige will ""tickle"" or playfight (in lack of better words) Roxy in front of their boyfriend, which is very uncomfortable for them since they're not a very touchy-feely person in general, and obviously embarrassed to being tickled like a 2 year old in front of their boyfriend.  
  
I suggested to them to maybe have some sort of written plan, like a roommate agreement so that their boundaries are very explicit and clear Roxy attempted to bring this up to Paige recently, only for Paige to deny any wrongdoing that they did on New Years, so the conversation never really progressed.  
  
Roxy is at a loss as to what to do, because their lease is coming to an end at their current place later this year, and plans to move with Paige to somewhere else (as they can’t afford living on their own). Boyfriend’s place is not an option unfortunately as he’s got his own housing issues going on. They’re trying to resolve this because not only is this making them uncomfortable, but they also want to maintain their friendship with Paige. Another solution I thought of is maybe to have some sort of “office hours” when they lock their door and are unavailable to Paige, but Roxy wanted to also see if there are any other solutions.

1. Lovely Runner:
I love a down bad loser, I loved the chemistry and romance between the leads, the loyalty they had to each other was so sweet. I also enjoyed the time traveling plot. Biased but I also love Byeon woo seok he’s my absolute fav 

2. 2521 and Twinkling Watermelon and Youth of May (IYKYK):
I just felt like these were a great coming of age story with well written characters and I enjoyed the romance

3. Hometown cha cha cha:
Feels like a warm hug, this is def my comfort drama. I love the way that the female lead slowly warms up to the male lead and they both complement each other so well despite being different from each other. Things got really good and once they got together things were a bit cringe but it was still quite enjoyable. 

4. My suspicious partner and Head Over Heels:
Great romance, but it was also the plot that kept me on my toes 

5. Dynamite Kiss:
The first two episodes were amazing, the middle of the show frustrated me and then the ending felt like rage bait. I don’t mind a cliche but it has to be written well. I liked this one though bc male lead was a down bad loser for the female lead. 

6. It’s okay that’s love (the one with gong hyo jin): 
I can’t remember this one well but I do know it was just very emotional for me? Maybe it was just bc that soundtrack was so fire LOL 

7. W - Two Worlds:
Liked the plot and the romance :) 

From what I can summarize, I think I usually like a really hot male lead that’s actually a down bad loser/yearner for the female lead, good romance, and great plot and great characters. Any dramas that hit any of those are great for me. 

What I don’t care for is slice of life unless it’s written well. 

I’ve seen a decent amount of dramas, just finished up Marry My Husband and liked it! Have been a kdrama watcher since 2016 so I’ve seen a decent amount. I’ll try to list ones that I remember that I’ve watched

For example I always wanted to visit Delhi, but people told me not to go as it is unsafe, but that must not be true for all places in Delhi. 

I always had this idea why can't we rate places based on experience and safety. Google reviews are just too generic rating how 'good a coffee is'. If we can tag any location on earth to  share our experience or any scam, it will make travelling so much easier and will not be able to juggle between 20 different vlogs and communities to hunt down which places to avoid. Just search a location and all data in one place, rating, scams, post etc.

Side effects have been okay except for horrendous bloating. I feel like I need to do a huge burp but it never comes. 

I also have zero appetite - just looking at food makes me feel sick. 

The only thing I’ve consumed today is a coffee, a Metamucil (cause I struggled a bit on the loo this morning) and 2 boiled eggs. Plenty of water.

Any tips for easing the bloat that worked for you? And will I be able to eat anything soon? I can’t see MJ being sustainable if I’m not able to eat at all. ",3,1767421701.0,mounjaroaustralia,11,1.0,False

1q2n9s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/1q2n9s7/dogs_in_grocery_stores/,Dogs in grocery stores...,"Preface: I know some people have trained service dogs they genuinely need. This is not about them. This is about regular pets.

Post-COVID, I have noticed people keep bringing their dogs into grocery stores and coffee shops, and it is getting out of hand. This is happening at Whole Foods, Shoprite, Trader Joe’s, and coffee shops all over JC. I have even seen dogs at bars who get into barking matches with each other. I know some places have the ""Service Dogs Only"" signs, but alotof  people don't seem to follow that. 

Dogs do not belong around fresh produce or food items. It is unsanitary and honestly gross. I have seen dogs sniffing food on the foot-level shelves at Trader Joe’s, and I personally watched a crusty little dog take a shit inside another grocery store. If you want to walk your dog, please take them to the park, not the damn Whole Foods.

Dogs are great. Pets are great. Grocery stores are not the place for them. Service animals are a separate and necessary thing, but regular pets should not be in places where people buy and consume food and drinks. I don't mean to sound like a Karen, but it's just getting annoying now.",15,1767421491.0,jerseycity,2,0.89,False
1q2n82d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2n82d,Uber Courier stole my parcel,"Hi, please suggest what can be done for this

The courier partner picked up the item and cancelled the booking without updating anything on the app. After picking up the order, he spent 20-30mins going away from the pick up point. After 20-30 mins, he cancelled the order.

Before coming for the pick up, he called the person who was sending the item asking about what was in the parcel and the sender informed that there’s a perfume. (Uber will have this recording with them).

Later on, when the app didn’t show that the order has been picked up, the sender contacted the courier partner about why there’s no update on app and he mentioned that he’ll update the status after completing another delivery on Rapido app. (Same - Uber should have voice recording for this too). Additionally, he also mentioned that he will deliver in 30mins, even though the ETA should have been 10-15mins maximum.

I’m attaching screenshots of the courier partner’s location. 

At 11:05 PM, he was at the pickup spot and he picked up the item that was to be delivered (attached screenshot)

At 11:12 PM, he went 400m away from the pick up spot without updating the app. (attached screenshot)

At 11:25 PM, he is 1.4km away from the pick up spot after which he cancelled the booking. (attached screenshot)

I had also switched on the confirm with PIN delivery since my perfume was expensive (INR 6,000), although it wasn’t any useful

Is there a way I can get my parcel back or atleast get compensated for th lost item?

1q2n7b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petaluma/comments/1h0ry3t/kfc_on_east_washington/lz6todi/,UPDATE:Owner of Teriyaki House on E. Washington,"Hi,

This is Kam’s nephew, Ben.  Unfortunately, my uncle passed away 2 years ago.  His family (my cousins and Aunt) now live in SoCal. 

Last weekend, I took a trip with my cousin, Bo (Kam’s daughter) and her family up to the Bay.  If you were a regular at Teriyaki House back in the day, you might have spotted the entire family working on the weekends. My Aunt (wife) prepping the food, Bo (daughter) behind the cash register while Casey (son) helping his dad on the grill.  The hilarious indicators that you’re at an Asian restaurant.

I’m born and raised in SoCal (SGV to be more specific and now living in SD), but I spend a lot of time in my adolescence visiting my aunt and uncle during school break, even at times hanging out or helping at Teriyaki House. The Bay has always been a 2^(nd) home to me and I was very close to my uncle and his family. 

We were able to visit Petaluma and stroll down Washington Street.  We got to stop by the lot where Teriyaki House used to be and what is now, What a Chicken!! Unfortunately, we were not able to try their food since they were closed for the holidays. Looking at the restaurant and the proximity of that area, we all got very nostalgic being there. I still remembered the antique shop that was next door to the restaurant, where we would bug Suzy, the shop owner.  We saw that Buffalo Wings restaurant across the street was still there, where we would do food exchanges with the restaurant owner.  It was a brief visit for us.  We got to hang out in an empty lot where Teriyaki House used to be, relive our memories, grabbed coffee at Pink Owl, then headed out.  Before heading back home though, I did a Google search on my uncle’s restaurant and businesses that I remembered in Petaluma back in the day which led me to this Reddit post.  I was able to show my cousins this, and we want to update the Petaluma community.  Reading the comments on this thread made us happy and grateful that Kam had you all in his life.

 

**Since Kam’s daughter, Bo doesn’t have a Reddit account, here’s what she had to say:**

>What a gem of a post we stumbled upon! I couldn’t get through the comments without a ton of tears and waves of wonderful memories. First off, I too am sad to see the KFC go, which prompted our initial reddit search. We visited last weekend for the first time in 10 years and while much has changed, much is still the same. I am beyond happy and thankful that the people of Petaluma still remember Teriyaki House and my dad, Kam. Without crying all over again, it means the world to me that his hard work and endless days and (19) years of being away from us (we lived in Hayward for the entire time we had the business) didn’t go in vain. My dad suffered a minor stroke in 2015, then a major one in 2016 leaving him paralyzed and mostly bed bound. We closed the restaurant very suddenly and never really looked back. We knew this was a sign that the long hours, laborious work and long commute had to come to an end. My mom took good care of him for 7 long years and in that time, he got to see all his grandkids be born and spend special moments with them. He passed in September of 2023. He died at home surrounded by my brother and I, and of course my mom, plus my 3 kids. To hear that teriyaki house is still talked about to this day/a year ago makes me so happy. The familiar faces that walked in every week truly made my dad’s day and he loved conversing and hearing about all the happenings in people’s lives. I am much like my dad, in that sense, so I know how much he enjoyed going to work, just to provide good food and a nice place to have a quick conversation. My dad started the restaurant when I was 6 years old, and now I’m 35, with a 7, 6 and (almost) 3 year old, so everything has really come full circle for me. Visiting this last weekend was a very emotional trip, bittersweet indeed. But nonetheless, well worth it, thanks to this post and the kind words and memories people had to share. I think about my dad often, as you can imagine, and it’s comforting to know that the people of Petaluma do too. I hope every trip down E Washington Street sparks a lovely memory of Kam and his teriyaki bowls!
