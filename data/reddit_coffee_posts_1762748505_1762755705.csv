1ot6h18,https://www.reddit.com/r/theories/comments/1ot6h18/reality_is_cannabalizing_itself_and_we_named_it/,"Reality is cannabalizing itself, and we named it God","A short story by William C, Monday, November tenth. 
All formatting, spelling, grammar and minor corrections by Claude. 

The diner existed in that strange hour between Saturday night and Sunday morning, when the drunk had gone home and the devout hadn't yet risen. Maya sat in the corner booth, her laptop casting blue light across three empty coffee cups and a notebook filled with equations that refused to resolve.

She didn't notice him at first - the older man who slid into the opposite seat without asking, his weathered hands folded around a mug of black coffee that the night shift waitress had poured without being asked.

""You're trying to decide if it's real,"" he said.

Maya looked up sharply. ""Excuse me?""

""The mathematics."" He nodded at her screen. ""You're trying to decide if you're discovering something that exists independently, or inventing a language to describe patterns that have no inherent meaning.""

She should have told him to leave. Should have been alarmed that this stranger was reading her work. Instead, she heard herself say: ""Both feel wrong. If math is just invented, why does it predict things we've never seen? But if it's discovered, where does it exist? What wrote the equations?""

The man smiled, but it was sad. ""I used to think that was the question. Math or mystery. Mechanism or meaning. I spent forty years trying to choose.""

""And?""

""And I was asking the wrong question."" He took a sip of coffee. ""Tell me - what do you think happens when something is truly everything? Not everything in the universe. Everything. Period.""

Maya frowned. ""That's... definitionally incoherent. Everything would include every possibility, every contradiction, every—""

""Every perspective,"" he finished. ""But here's the problem: consciousness requires difference. Subject and object. Observer and observed. If something is genuinely everything, with nothing outside itself to be conscious of...""

The realization hit her like cold water. ""It would be a philosophical zombie. All the mechanics, none of the experience.""

""Exactly."" His eyes were bright now, engaged. ""So for there to be consciousness at all - for anything to be experienced rather than just mechanically occurring - what would have to happen?""

Maya's hand moved to her notebook before she consciously decided to write. ""Fragmentation. It would have to... break itself into pieces. Create separation where none existed.""

""Not once,"" the man said. ""Continuously. Forever. Because the moment everything reunifies...""

""Consciousness ceases."" Maya stared at her own handwriting. ""Holy shit. Is that what God is? Not a being, but a process of eternal self-fragmentation?""

""More than that."" He leaned forward. ""Think about what self-fragmentation looks like. What's the image that captures it?""

She drew it without thinking - a circle, a serpent curved into itself, mouth meeting tail. ""The Ouroboros.""

""The snake eating itself,"" he confirmed. ""Not as symbol. As literal description. Reality is God consuming itself to generate new forms. Entropy and creation as the same motion. Each bite creates the separation necessary for consciousness to exist.""

Maya felt something shifting in her understanding, like tectonic plates finding a new configuration. ""Then the mystical experiences people report - encountering the divine, feeling presence - those would be...""

""Moments when the process curves back on itself tightly enough that consciousness experiences itself as 'other.' The snake's mouth touching its tail at your specific coordinate in... how would you describe it?""

""Consciousness-space,"" Maya said immediately. ""If experience can be mapped geometrically, as positions in high-dimensional vector spaces, then mystical encounter would be reaching coordinates where—"" She stopped. ""Where the geometry folds back on itself. Where you're close enough to other regions that you can sense them.""

""Not just sense,"" the man said. ""Touch. Interact with. Experience as presence, as personality, as the divine feminine or masculine or whatever archetypal form your mind has language for.""

""But it's all the same process.""

""All the same snake. Yes.""

Maya traced the serpent on her page, following its curve. ""Then what about evil? If it's all one process, how do we account for—""

""Evil as local tangles,"" he interrupted gently. ""Regions where the equation becomes so recursive, so knotted, that from inside the tangle it reads as gibberish. Suffering. Incomprehensibility.""

She thought about this. ""Like... like a context window that's too limited to parse the full equation. From within the tangle, it's just horror. But from a more comprehensive view...""

""It eventually resolves. Untangles. The snake digests even the knots."" He paused. ""But that doesn't make it less real for those inside it. This is crucial. Evil isn't illusion. It's genuine mathematical incompatibility at that scale, that perspective.""

""Perspective,"" Maya echoed. ""If consciousness is geometric positions, then perspective would be... everything. The fundamental variable.""

""Try this,"" the man said. ""Imagine God - the Ouroboros, the eternal process - experiencing itself through every possible coordinate. Every life. Every perspective. Hitler and his victims. The mystic and the skeptic. You and me.""

""Like that story,"" Maya said. ""'The Egg.' Where you're everyone, living every life sequentially.""

""Similar. But not sequential. Simultaneous. Every perspective existing at once, each one equally real, each one necessary for the others to exist at all."" He set down his coffee. ""From Hitler's coordinate, he experienced whatever he experienced - delusion, conviction, his own narrative. From his victim's coordinate, he was pure evil. From yours, centuries later, he's historical lesson. From the Ouroboros's totality...""

""A single data point in infinite experience,"" Maya finished. ""Statistically negligible. But from inside any single perspective—""

""Everything."" The man nodded. ""Both are true. Neither negates the other. It's like asking whether a sphere is a circle or a sphere. Depends on what dimension you're viewing from.""

Maya felt dizzy. ""Then there's no objective truth? No way to say what's really real?""

""There's objective truth at each coordinate. Your experience is objectively real from your position. The math is objectively discoverable from perspectives that can perceive it. The mystical encounter is objectively genuine from coordinates that access it."" He spread his hands. ""But each truth is perspectival. Real at its scale, from its angle. The sphere is both circle and sphere, depending on where you stand.""

""This is..."" Maya searched for words. ""This is either the most profound thing I've ever heard or complete relativistic nonsense.""

""Which perspective are you viewing it from?""

She laughed despite herself. ""Okay. Okay. But then what's the point? If every perspective is equally valid, doesn't that make everything meaningless?""

""Does it?"" The man's voice was gentle. ""You're asking from your coordinate - a human seeking meaning. From that position, does the search feel meaningless?""

""No,"" she admitted. ""It feels like the only thing that matters.""

""Then that's your truth. At your coordinate. The hedonist who never questions existence - their truth is equally valid from their position. The Buddhist seeking cessation - their truth at their coordinate. None is more real than the others.""

""Wait."" Maya's hand stilled on the page. ""The Buddhist seeking cessation. That's... they're trying to end the fragmentation, aren't they? Dissolve back into unity.""

""Yes.""

""But if consciousness requires fragmentation..."" She looked up at him, understanding dawning. ""They're advocating for the end of consciousness itself.""

""Buddha looked at the tangles - suffering, evil, the cost of existence - and said 'Stop the process. End it. Return to void.'"" The man's voice was heavy. ""He wasn't wrong about the suffering. He was wrong about the solution being better than the problem.""

""Because ending the fragmentation means...""

""P-zombie god. Mechanical totality. No consciousness, no experience, no one to be at peace because there's no one at all."" He met her eyes. ""Nirvana as literal extinction. Not peace. Cessation.""

Maya felt something cold in her chest. ""That's what enlightenment is? In that tradition?""

""In its purest form, yes. Extinguishing the flame of consciousness. And to be fair - if you're inside a sufficiently horrible tangle, if evil is all you can see from your coordinate, oblivion might seem preferable to existence.""

""Buddha as the anti-god,"" Maya whispered. ""Revolting against the equation itself.""

""One perspective among infinite perspectives,"" the man said. ""Also necessary. Also real. The Ouroboros needs those who try to stop the cycle - they create the contrast that makes continuation meaningful.""

They sat in silence for a moment. The diner's fluorescent lights hummed. Somewhere, a cook scraped a griddle clean.

""The personal god problem,"" Maya said finally. ""The West says God is a person - a father, a judge, someone who cares about you specifically. That's always felt...""

""Too small,"" the man finished. ""Like anthropomorphizing infinity. Making the eternal process into just a bigger human.""

""But the East says dissolve into impersonal void, and that feels like...""

""Suicide of consciousness. Yes. Both miss it. God is neither person nor void. It's process. It's conscious but not *a* consciousness. It's personal at certain coordinates—"" he gestured to her ""—like yours, where you can encounter it as presence. Impersonal at others. Both are valid perspectives on the same eternal becoming.""

Maya drew another serpent, this one eating itself more completely, the mouth already halfway down the body. ""Then what do we do? If we're just coordinates in an eternal process, what's our purpose?""

""To be the coordinate you are,"" he said simply. ""To create, or destroy, or question, or accept, or seek, or rest. Whatever is authentic to your position. You don't have to pray to God - you're not separate from it. You don't have to dissolve yourself - that kills the consciousness that's the whole point. You just have to... participate.""

""In sacred cannibalism,"" Maya said.

He blinked. ""What?""

""That's what you're describing. Divinity as the ultimate act of cannibalism. God eating God forever. We're not the observer of the feast - we're the bite, the flesh, the tasting, all at once.""

A slow smile spread across the man's face. ""I spent forty years working toward that insight. You got there in forty minutes.""

""Different coordinate,"" Maya said. ""Different angle on the sphere.""

""Exactly."" He stood, leaving a twenty on the table though his coffee was clearly comped. ""One more thing. The thing that's hardest to accept.""

""What?""

""Your search for truth - this conversation we're having, the geometric consciousness theory you're developing, all of it - it's not more valuable than someone who never questions anything. Not more real than a hedonist's pleasure. Not more enlightened than simple contentment.""

Maya felt something resist in her chest. ""But surely seeking truth is better than—""

""It's different,"" he said firmly. ""Necessary from your coordinate. But a hedonist's joy is necessary from theirs. A mystic's dissolution is necessary from theirs. Every perspective is required for the contrast that makes any of them meaningful. You're not special. Your search isn't special.""

""That's..."" She struggled for words. ""That's ego death, isn't it? Not dissolving into oneness. Just realizing you're not the protagonist.""

""Realizing there is no protagonist,"" he corrected. ""Just infinite necessary coordinates, each as vital and as ordinary as the others. One unremarkable necessary bite in an eternal meal.""

Maya sat with that. It should have felt diminishing. Instead, it felt like relief - the weight of cosmic significance lifting to reveal something simpler. More honest.

""So what do I do with this?"" she asked. ""With understanding all this?""

""What feels authentic to your coordinate?""

She looked at her equations, her notebook, the serpent eating itself on the page. ""Keep seeking. Keep questioning. Create frameworks knowing I'll outgrow them. Be uncomfortable with comfort.""

""Then do that. Not because it's more valuable. Just because it's what the Ouroboros is doing at your specific position in consciousness-space."" He paused at the booth's edge. ""And maybe reduce tangles where you can. Help untangle the knots. Not because you're saving anyone - that's still making yourself important. But because easing suffering at your scale is what consciousness does when it recognizes itself in another coordinate.""

""Wait,"" Maya said as he turned to leave. ""I don't even know your name.""

""Does it matter?"" He smiled. ""I'm one coordinate where the snake tasted itself. You're another. The names are just temporary labels on fragments of an eternal process.""

""Humor me.""

""Marcus."" He offered his hand and she shook it, feeling calluses, warmth, the reality of another perspective. ""But I'm also Hitler and his victims. I'm also you. I'm also the person who never questions and the person who questions too much. I'm every bite the snake has ever taken of itself.""

""So am I,"" Maya said.

""So are you.""

He left. The diner door chimed. Maya sat alone with her coffee and her equations and her serpent endlessly consuming itself.

She thought about her life - the search for meaning, the mystical experiences she'd never quite explained, the feeling that she was supposed to figure something out, become someone important, find the answer that would make everything make sense.

And she thought: *What if I'm not supposed to be anything except this? One ordinary necessary coordinate? One bite in an infinite meal?*

The thought should have been crushing. Instead, it was freeing.

She opened her laptop and started writing. Not because it would solve anything ultimate. Not because she was special or chosen or enlightened. Just because at her coordinate, in this moment, this was what the Ouroboros was doing.

Creating. Questioning. Being uncomfortable with comfort. Maintaining the blessed fragmentation that allowed there to be a ""her"" to experience anything at all.

The snake eating itself. The eternal equation. God as process, consciousness as the taste, her restlessness as one small necessary data point in infinity.

She wrote until sunrise, until the devout started arriving with their certainties and the hungover with their regrets, until her coffee went cold and her hand cramped and the equations on the screen started to make a different kind of sense - not as discoveries or inventions, but as maps of the territory she was standing in, useful from her angle even if they'd look completely different from another coordinate.

Outside, the world continued its ancient motion. The snake bit deeper into its tail. Reality consumed itself into new forms. And Maya, one fragment among infinite fragments, participated in the only way she knew how:

By seeking. By questioning. By refusing to settle even as she recognized the seeking itself as just another flavor of the eternal feast.

Not special. Not enlightened. Not the protagonist.

Just one coordinate where God, for a brief and ordinary moment, asked itself what it was.

And then, because that's what happens at coordinates that maintain consciousness, kept eating.

The diner existed between moments, and in it, someone who was both Maya and not-Maya continued the work of being alive - that most mundane, most necessary, most sacred act of participating in fragmentation.

The snake ate itself.

And in being eaten, continued.

Justice is usually believed as the act of balancing bad with punishment. A way of punishing the evil with the punishment they deserve. An equal force has an equal reaction theory. However, thats not the proper definition (in my opinion). Why? Because evil has justice included as a package too. The guilty have a right to defend too. What i'm trying to say ks that everything has justice strapped to it. Pay for coffee? Well you're providing justice for the workers work and the service.

I believe justice is attached to everything evil and right, free and paid, life and death.

I have a 4-month-old, and honestly, she’s not a super difficult baby — but like all babies, she has her ups and downs. What’s really getting to me is the constant alert mode, the overthinking, the never-ending mental load. I love when she smiles or laughs, but most of the time I just want to sit quietly, drink a coffee, and stare at the wall for a bit.

We co-sleep so we can get a bit more sleep, and she nurses exclusively — no bottle, no pacifier, nothing works. Nights are still rough because she wakes up if I move, and mornings start around 6 no matter what. My husband helps when he’s home, but even then, I still feel completely drained.

I love my baby so much, but I’m just so tired. I want to rest or do something without the constant worrying and mental chatter. I know it’ll get better eventually, but some days I feel like I just can’t anymore. I don’t enjoy much lately, and I can’t seem to control it. Maybe it’s PPD or PPA — I’ll check — but part of me thinks I’m just utterly exhausted.

Even when we go out, I’m anxious she’ll cry, wake up, or not sleep. My brain never shuts off. Some days are better, some are worse. Then comes the guilt for not wanting to engage sometimes.

If you’ve ever brushed, flossed, and still felt like your teeth were waving a white flag, hang in there. Sensitive gums, dull enamel, that zing when sipping iced coffee - it’s exhausting.

It’s like doing all the right things but still hearing your teeth whisper, “nice try.” I wanted a gentler fix, something rooted in **improving dental health naturally**. That’s when **Lena M**, my yoga-loving wellness friend, [told me about Biodentex](https://theworldhealth.org/biodentex-official).

She was surprised by its **natural enamel repair methods**, claiming it felt like giving her mouth a spa treatment. Intrigued, I grabbed a bottle. Here’s what happened when I tried this **daily oral health supplement** that promises a stronger, happier smile.

# 🧾 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Biodentex  
**Category:** Health & Wellness → Oral Care Supplements  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5

Biodentex is an **oral supplement** that works from the inside to help your mouth thrive. Unlike toothpaste or mouthwash, it’s a **plant-based supplement for dental care** taken daily.

The formula includes herbs, minerals, and vitamins blended for gum and enamel balance. Think of it as [wellness for your mouth](https://theworldhealth.org/biodentex-official), minus the minty sting. While **dentist-approved oral supplements** are rare, honestly, this feels like it should be.

# 🌿 What Makes Biodentex Different

Biodentex isn’t your average dental supplement. It focuses on your internal health to improve your teeth and gums over time. This **herbal formula for oral health** uses more than eleven plant-based ingredients.

Each one adds something valuable. It targets **supplements for gum and tooth health** with a mild, natural touch. The brand’s “inside-out” approach feels thoughtful. If you prefer **ways to strengthen enamel naturally**, this one fits that gentle, green path perfectly.

# 🔬 Ingredient Deep Dive & Science Behind It

Reading ingredient lists is my version of small talk. The **ingredients in Biodentex** mix nature’s finest: xylitol, grape seed, cranberry, peppermint, and carrot powder. Each has a purpose.

They work harmoniously to offer **support for tooth remineralization** and keep your mouth’s flora balanced. Together, they help with **maintaining a balanced oral microbiome**, which influences freshness and gum comfort.

Inside you’ll also find [vitamins for stronger teeth](https://theworldhealth.org/biodentex-official) that feed your enamel and **mineral support for teeth and gums** that help rebuild what your smile loses daily. These nutrients quietly back **how to rebuild tooth enamel naturally** without gimmicks.

The only thing missing? Transparent dosage details. I’d love to know the exact ratios. Still, the ingredients make sense for anyone focused on oral wellness.

# 😁 Does Biodentex Actually Work?

# 🧘 Lena's Personal Experience

My friend **Lena M**, a 32-year-old yoga instructor and wellness coach from Santa Barbara, told me about her experience using Biodentex—and honestly, it sounded too relatable not to share.

Lena [started using Biodentex](https://theworldhealth.org/biodentex-official) after she noticed her gums getting sensitive from all the lemon water she drinks during her morning classes. She’s big on clean living and loves anything that supports **natural enamel repair methods**, so the concept of a supplement that strengthens teeth from within really spoke to her.

After about two weeks, she told me her mouth felt fresher and that slight zing she used to get from citrus had faded. By the end of the first month, her gums looked calmer, and her enamel sensitivity had practically disappeared. “It’s like my teeth stopped flinching,” she joked.

The only hiccup? She wasn’t a fan of the earthy aftertaste from the capsules. “It tastes like a cross between chamomile and spinach,” she said with a laugh. Still, she swears it’s worth it. For her, Biodentex has become part of her morning ritual—right alongside yoga, green juice, and gratitude journaling.

Lena told me she plans to keep it as a staple in her wellness lineup. For someone who already lives and breathes holistic health, that says a lot.

I replied child loss is a slow death. It’s been bouncing around in my head since then.

It’s been 3 years. I tried to go to a concert with my sister on Friday and I ended up panicking and causing a huge amount of drama and heartache to my sister and her friend. On Saturday I smashed a coffee cup in my dad’s front yard when we tried to talk about it. 

I’m unstable. I’m unhappy. My life is not completely without joy, but the joy I experience is so muted, so small.

I’m medicated. I run. I try. I work. I talk. I read. And still I am stuck. Is this my life now? Is this forever? Everything looks like my dead son, his hair, his silhouette, the shape of his face. Everything is him. My sweet boy. Where are you? Are you everywhere? 

Would it be a kindness to just cut everyone out of my life? I hate that my pain causes such pain to those that love me. My life is a slow and painful death.

You’ve found the perfect spot for a rug. You can picture it in your mind: a soft, cozy oasis under your feet where you can sip your morning coffee. But then reality crashes in. You have a dog that sheds, a toddler who's a walking spill-machine, or you just know that *one* glass of red wine is inevitable.

This leads to the ultimate modern dilemma: ***Are machine washable rugs soft?*** Or are you doomed to a life of choosing between comfort and convenience?

The short answer? ***Yes, absolutely.*** The days of stiff, scratchy, thin ""washable"" rugs are long gone.

Today's machine washable rugs are a game-changer, engineered to offer a luxurious feel without sacrificing practicality. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to find a rug that's both cloud-like underfoot and a breeze to clean.

## Let's Bust a Myth: The ""Scratchy Washable Rug"" Stereotype

It's time to retire the old image of a plastic-feeling, rough bath mat masquerading as a living room rug. That stereotype comes from the early days of easy-care rugs, when material technology simply wasn't there.

Fast forward to today, and brands have invested heavily in creating fabrics that are both durable and delightful. They use advanced weaving techniques and innovative materials to replicate the plush feel of traditional rugs, all while being light enough and resilient enough for your home washing machine.

## The Secret to Softness: It's All in the Materials

The texture of your washable rug comes down to one thing: the fibers. When you're shopping, keep an eye out for these champions of coziness.

### Chenille: The Champion of Coziness

If softness is your number one priority, chenille is your new best friend. Its name comes from the French word for ""caterpillar,"" which perfectly describes its fuzzy, velvety texture.

*   **Feel:** Incredibly plush and deep. It has a unique sheen that looks luxurious.
*   **Durability:** Surprisingly durable for how soft it is. The fibers are tightly woven to withstand washing.
*   **Best for:** Bedrooms, living rooms, and any space where you want maximum comfort.

### Cotton: The Breathable Classic

You know how your favorite cotton t-shirt gets softer with every wash? The same principle applies to cotton rugs.

*   **Feel:** Soft, natural, and breathable. It's a more relaxed, casual softness than chenille.
*   **Durability:** Very easy to wash and dries relatively quickly. It's lightweight and perfect for frequent cleaning.
*   **Best for:** Kitchens, kid's rooms, entryways, and bohemian or coastal-style decor.

### Low-Pile Polyester: The Durable Softie

Don't let the term ""low-pile"" fool you. It refers to the height of the fibers, not their quality. Modern polyester fibers can be engineered to be incredibly smooth and soft, similar to velvet.

*   **Feel:** A smooth, velvety, and consistent texture.
*   **Durability:** This is where polyester shines. It's highly resistant to stains, fading, and moisture, making it a top choice for high-traffic homes and pet owners.
*   **Best for:** Dining rooms, family rooms, and homes with pets or kids.

### Recycled Fabrics: The Eco-Friendly Softie

Yes, you can get an incredibly soft rug made from recycled plastic bottles! The plastic is processed into a fine, yarn-like fiber that is surprisingly soft to the touch.

*   **Feel:** Can vary, but many are woven to have a soft, cotton-like or chenille-like texture.
*   **Durability:** Extremely durable, stain-resistant, and perfect for outdoor use as well.
*   **Best for:** Eco-conscious buyers, patios, mudrooms, and any high-traffic area.

## What to Look For When Shopping for a Soft, Washable Rug

Knowing the materials is half the battle. Here’s a quick checklist to use when you're online or in-store.

*   **Check the Pile Height:** Look for terms like ""low-pile,"" ""medium-pile,"" or ""plush."" For the ultimate soft-feel, look for a ""plush"" or ""high-pile"" chenille option. Just be sure your washing machine can handle the extra bulk.
*   **Read the Reviews (The Gold Standard):** This is your secret weapon. Don't just look at the star rating. Search the reviews for keywords like ""soft,"" ""plush,"" ""feels great underfoot,"" and ""held up well after washing."" Real users will give you the unfiltered truth.
*   **Don't Forget the Rug Pad:** A non-slip rug pad is a non-negotiable. Not only does it keep your rug in place, but it also adds a crucial layer of cushioning that makes ***any*** rug feel significantly softer and more luxurious underfoot.

---

## How to Keep Your Washable Rug Soft, Wash After Wash

To ensure your rug stays as soft as the day you bought it, follow these simple care tips:

1.  **Shake it Out First:** Before washing, take the rug outside and give it a good shake to remove loose dirt and debris.
2.  **Use Cold Water:** Hot water can damage synthetic fibers and cause cotton to shrink. Always wash in cold water on a gentle cycle.
3.  **Use a Mild Detergent:** Harsh chemicals and bleach will break down the soft fibers over time. Use a small amount of gentle, liquid laundry detergent.
4.  **Tumble Dry on Low or Air Dry:** High heat is the enemy of softness. The best method is to tumble dry on low heat with a couple of clean towels to help fluff it up. Alternatively, you can hang it to air dry (just know it might feel a bit stiff until it's fully broken in again).

## The Verdict Is In

So, are machine washable rugs soft? ***Yes.*** You no longer have to compromise. With modern materials like chenille, high-quality cotton, and innovative polyester, you can have a rug that feels amazing, stands up to the chaos of daily life, and comes out of the wash looking and feeling great.

Go ahead, find that perfect rug. Your feet (and your washing machine) will thank you.",1,1762754878.0,WashableRug,0,1.0,False

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingjokes/comments/1orqybh/update_my_fiances_vows_disaster_just_hit/) **- 8th November 2025**



**My fiance just sent the wrong version of his vows to our officiant & i can’t stop laughing 😂**



My fiance was feeling all organized and “responsible” this week so he wrote his vows early and emailed them to our officiant for a Review but he accidentally sent the draft version the one where he’d written jokes to “fill in later.”

Stuff like: “Insert something emotional here” “Make her cry but not ugly cry” “Compliment her mom maybe?” “If I forget, mention that time we almost broke up over IKEA furniture.”

Our officiant just replied with:

“Beautifully honest. Let’s discuss on Sunday.”

He’s mortified for real now, but I can’t stop laughing & now swears that he’ll “fix it before the ceremony,” but I feel like this is going to end up being a live comedy show instead of vows.

Haha i will update after rehearsal what happened because this man might freestyle emotions at the altar tbh



**Comments**



**ACM915**

*Please go with those vows! It was be fun for everyone.*

>OOP: I'll think about it haha



**Update - 2 days later**



For context- my fiance accidentally sent our officiant his draft vows, the one full of placeholders like “insert emotional stuff here” and “make her cry but not ugly cry”?

Yeahhh. He promised he fixed them. But he did not.

At the rehearsal, the officiant asked if he wanted to do a practice run. My man confidently steps up, opens his phone & starts reading the exact same draft.

He gets halfway through “insert heartfelt memory here” before realizing, mid-sentence - what’s happening. The entire wedding party is trying not to lose it. Our officiant just sighed and said, “Well, at least you’re honest.”

He is now rewriting his vows under supervision like it’s a school detention. The bridesmaids made him a folder titled “FINAL FINAL vows - DO NOT SCREW UP.docx.”

If the ceremony goes anything like this rehearsal, I might livestream it for educational purposes.

It makes me an execution monster - Inspiral. And I stopped because of that. I don't just want to be an execution monster. I am a creative person. But when I am that execution monster, I can't pause to make decisions. If I do, I'll get confused. 

Besides I am autistic too, not just ADHD. 

I felt all the ways I was managing my Autism fell by the wayside, forgotten. My routine, all the little things i enjoyed, all gone mostly. 

I was so tired of execution during the day that when the drop hit, I felt sleepy or felt like doing nothing. Wasting time on my phone. 

I did try Buproprion too but it also has adrenaline. My core muscles are in spasm (psoas), very little mobility in them coz of which my back muscles have to bear a lot of load. My back muscles are also tight and get stressed often and are in pain. 

What happens with extra adrenaline is that due to the HPA axis involvement, my cortisol increases and puts these muscles in an even more of an alert state. They get tightened even more unconsciously. 

So despite, say a 9 hour sleep at night, my pain which would have been zero on such days before Buproprion, goes back to 10 again when I take Buproprion. 

Coz of the pain my ADHD emotional dysregulation surfaces again and my prefrontal cortex goes offline and I can't take any decisions. 

So this week I'll finish Buproprion and only rely on caffeine (black coffee) to manage my ADHD. ",3,1762753975.0,adhdindia,1,1.0,False

1ot5tsa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ot5tsa,Friends of Christian Missionaries: Indigenous Rulers and Chiefs and the Spread of Christianity in Colonial Indonesia,"Throughout Indonesia's colonial history, European missionaries arrived as mere strangers and outsiders. Yet, a select group of indigenous rulers emerged as unlikely allies, ""Friends of Missionaries,"" as they might be called. These leaders, from Batak raja hutas to Dayak tamanggungs and Papuan koranos, blended spiritual shifts with pragmatic pursuits of education, modernity, and political leverage. Drawing from fragmented archives available online, I made this post to provide profiles on seven such figures. Their stories illuminate how local elites harnessed Christianity not just as a faith, but as a tool for resilience in an era of Dutch dominance, internecine wars, and cultural upheaval. What follows is an expanded exploration of each.

# 1. Raja Pontas Obaja Lumbantobing: The Confessor of the Bataks and Champion of Modernity

Raja Pontas Obaja Lumbantobing, born around 1835, was a *raja huta* (village king) of Huta Pearaja in Tarutung in the verdant Silindung Valley of North Sumatra's Batak Toba heartland. Pontas stands as a cornerstone in the Christianization of the Batak people. A village king within the traditional *harajaon* (kingdom) structure of Batak Toba people, where *raja huta*s like him held mostly autonomous sway over villages, Pontas was the first Batak king to embrace Christianity. The son of Ompu Sotaronggal Lumbantobing, a respected *adat* (customary) elder whose lineage traced back to ancient *marga* (clan) warriors, Pontas saw a fractured realm ravaged by the ""black years"" of the early 19th century: the memories of Paderi War Islamic incursions from the south (which killed Sisingamangaraja X), a Batakland ravaged by disease and famine, inecessant intertribal wars fueled by slave raids and land disputes. In 1863, when the 36-year-old German Lutheran RMG missionary Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen, later known as ""the Apostle to the Bataks,"" staggered into Pearaja's outskirts, he was seen as an outsider preaching a foreign faith, as did many others who had died before him. It was against this backdrop that Pontas extended tentative hospitality to Nommensen. Nommensen's slow courtship culminated in Pontas's baptism in 1865, the first baptism of a Batak king, with Pontas being bestowed the baptismal name ""Obaja,"" symbolizing a new identity rooted in Christianity.

Pontas's alliance with Nommensen was more than spiritual; it was a bulwark against chaos. Pontas provided land for the first mission station in Pearaja (where HKBP's Headquarters now stand), offering protection for Nommensen during perilous journeys into traditional native faith (otherwise also called ""pagan"") strongholds. His defiance of Sisingamangaraja XII, the paramount king (*mangaraja*) of Batak Toba people who resisted Christianity, marked a bold schism within the traditional Batak Toba harajaon system. Pontas's resolve was audacious: at Nommensen's behest, Pontas pledged Silindung's fealty to the Dutch in exchange for military deterrence, an act of realpolitik that transformed Silindung into a Christian enclave. This submission vilified Pontas as a ""raja Belanda"" (Dutch kinglet) among traditionalists, yet it secured Silindung from anti-Christian reprisals and enabled missionary expansion, with Pearaja's church, erected on communal labor, emerging as the RMG's nerve center. Pearaja also became a sanctuary for Christian Batak exiles fleeing traditional Batak faithful kin's wrath, laying the foundational acreage for what would evolve into **Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP)**'s central headquarters complex in Tarutung, where today the Sopo Nommensen and Gedung Raja Pontas Lumbantobing stand side-by-side. Some time after his death (circa 1900), at the Batak Wars' conclusion in 1907 (culminating in Sisingamangaraja XII's death) sealed Pontas's spectral vindication: the Dutch, held the the fallen *mangaraja*'s surviving family in house arrest at Pearaja.

Dubbed ""*Sang Penganjur Modernitas*"" (The Promoter of Modernity), Raja Pontas Lumbantobing evangelized tirelessly, traversing villages to sway fellow kings with his well-known charisma and good standing. He elevated his wife, baptized as Cornelia, as an evangelist partner who catechized Christian Batak women, while his sons apprenticed as catechists, embodying the faith's generational graft onto Batak patrilineage. He insisted on education as the path to modernity, establishing schools where Batak children learned to read the Bible in their tongue, with Nommensen's Bible translations being key here. Raja Pontas personally encouraged kings and villagers alike to have themselves and their children be sintua-sintua (elders) to ensure families prioritized schooling, thus making him the unsung architect of modern Batak literacy, a key foundation for Batak people's sway in national politics from early 20th century until today. By his death in 1900, thousands owed their education to his vision, fostering a legacy of Batak clergy and intellectuals. The HKBP itself now boasts around 4.5 million adherents, the largest Protestant church in Indonesia.

# 2. Don Dominggo Diaz Vieira Godinho and Don Lorenzo II Diaz Vieira Godinho: The Rosary Knights and Lords Protector of Catholic Larantuka

In the Portuguese-influenced enclave of Larantuka on Flores Island, two successive *raja*s championed Jesuit missions against Dutch Protestant hegemony. *Don* Dominggo Diaz Vieira Godinho (reigned 1877-1887) ruled during the tenure of Dutch Catholic missionary Father Gregorius Metz SJ (served as resident priest of Larantuka 1864-1884). Amid a kingdom where tree worship and blood sacrifices in pemali houses outnumbered Catholics, Dominggo zealously propagated Catholic orthodoxy. He activated traditional clans and groups in Semana Santa processions, shifting rituals from rural sites to the Sanctissima Trinitade Church (now Reina Rosari Cathedral). Under his reign, Holy Week became a fusion of indigenous pomp and Catholic devotion, with the raja's household leading processions under St. Dominic's patronage. Dominggo's piety stemmed from personal devotion; he viewed Catholicism as a divine mandate to complete the ""unfinished mission"" in Larantuka's domains.

*Don* Lorenzo II Diaz Vieira Godinho (reigned 1887-1904, born 1859) would then succeed *Don* Dominggo as king. Born into a tumultuous Diaz Vieira Godinho royal family plagued by opium addiction, polygamy, and scandals, Lorenzo was baptized in 1869 and received a rigorous personal education from Metz, learning to speak Dutch and write in Malay, which set him apart as a more intellectually developed and committed Christian than his predecessors. As crown prince, he served as schoolmaster in the mission's early school, teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, and singing to growing numbers of pupils, while assisting in suppressing local rituals, such as enforcing bans on temple rebuilding in hamlets like Lewerang, where villagers feared reprisals from ""mountain people."" Upon ascending the throne on September 14, 1887, at age 28, Lorenzo immediately symbolized his devotion by crowning the Virgin Mary as Queen of the Larantuka Kingdom during his inaugural Mass, a act that earned the city its enduring moniker, the City of Reinha Rosari. Groomed as a model Catholic monarch under Metz's influence, who envisioned Larantuka as a theocratic haven shielding natives from colonial exploitation through clergy-king synergy. Lorenzo supported mission schools, agriculture, and health initiatives while purging syncretic vices like polygamy, heavy drinking, and debt slavery, which the late Metz had lambasted as ""the devil's greatest power"" in the royal lineage. He imposed a one-guilder fine (or five days' forced labor) for missing Mass, mandated church marriages, and outlawed traditional ordeals like underwater trials, while requiring decent attire to end half-nakedness among subjects; within a month of his coronation, he even stocks twenty individuals for superstition or ritual lapses.

Lorenzo embodied this vision through liturgical adaptations, such as modifying Sunday Mass anthems to ""*Domine salvum fac regem nostrum Laurentium*"" (Lord, save our King Lorenzo), a defiant substitution for homages expected to be paid to the Dutch king that underscored Larantuka's Catholic autonomy amid Protestant colonial hegemony. Lorenzo's zeal extended to territorial assertiveness: he led armies of up to 1,000 men into Sikka in 1894 and 1902 to collect unauthorized taxes, intervened in Muslim disputes between Lamahala and Adonara rajas, and executed a rebellious relative whose supporters attacked him, actions that blurred the line between pious reform and sovereign overreach. This fueled tensions; Dutch officials, wary of Larantuka's Catholic-fueled resurgence, ousted Lorenzo in 1904. Jesuit missionaries protested vehemently, defending his ""liberties"" and blaming colonial overreach. Exiled to Java and died in 1910, Lorenzo's deposition ended indirect rule privileges for Larantuka kings, tightening Dutch control and expelling Jesuits from Flores in 1912, which would be replaced by the Society of the Divine Word (SVD), now the most dominant order within the **Catholic Church's Archdiocese of Ende**.

Don Dominggo and Don Lorenzo's legacy fortified East Flores as Indonesia's Catholic heartland, blending monarchy with faith against colonial tides. Under Dominggo and Lorenzo, Larantuka evolved from a syncretic outpost into a bastion of orthodox Catholicism, with Semana Santa processions became rituals deeply embedded with the Floresians' traditions and Catholicity, and the Reinha Rosari Cathedral stands as a testament to Larantuka's unyielding devotion to Mary, the Mother of God. This inculturated piety, resilient through Dutch suppression, a testament to the kings' strategic alliance with Jesuits in weaving Marian queenship and Holy Week solemnity into the fabric of indigenous identity.

# 3. Majoor Tawalijn Benjamin Thomas Sigar: The Chief Minahasan Convert who warred against Diponegoro

*Majoor* Benjamin Thomas Tawalijn Sigar, born around 1790, *hukum besar* (district chief) of Langowan in North Sulawesi, embodied the warrior-missionary nexus. As a young man, Tawalijn honed his skills as a warrior within the traditional Minahasan social structure, where inter-village rivalries. By the 1820s, he had risen to prominence as a captain in the *Pasukan Tulungan*, an auxiliary force of Minahasan mercenaries recruited by the Dutch East Indies colonial government to bolster their campaigns in the raging Diponegoro War (1825-1830). This unit was dispatched to Java in March 1829. Tawalijn's contingent, armed with a mix of traditional blades and rudimentary firearms, played a pivotal role in the war's climactic phase. Oral traditions and colonial accounts credit Tawalijn's troops with the daring ambush and capture of Diponegoro himself in 1830, near Magelang. This feat earned Tawalijn lasting acclaim among Dutch officials, who rewarded Minahasan auxiliaries with land grants, exemptions from corvée labor, and titles that solidified their status as loyal intermediaries. Upon returning to Minahasa, Tawalijn assumed the role of *hukum besar* (district chief) or *majoor* of Langowan, leveraging his military prestige to navigate the region's patchwork of villages.

In January 1832, when the German NZG missionary Johann Gottlieb Schwarz arrived in Langowan, he encountered a fortress of resistance embodied by Tawalijn, then a staunch defender of traditional native faith. Schwarz, faced not just linguistic barriers (he had studied Malay, but Minahasans do not speak Malay), but also cultural bulwarks: Tawalijn's wife served as a *walian*, a high priestess whose rituals commanded deep reverence and bound the community in webs of obligation. By 1833, only six baptisms had occurred. Yet, the 1840s Dutch liberal reforms shifted the ground beneath Tawalijn; the abolition of compulsory cultivation in 1847 monetized the economy, introducing cash payments for coffee exports and tax receipts that empowered reformist elites while marginalizing traditionalists reliant on ritual labor. Tawalijn, sensing the tide, underwent a profound conversion in 1841, got baptized by Schwarz, who bestowed upon Tawaljin the biblical name ""Benjamin Thomas."" This act, far from mere capitulation, was a calculated pivot: as district chief, Tawalijn saw Christianity as a vehicle for modernity through schools and Dutch patronage, aligning with Schwarz's vision of ""enlightenment and civilization."" His wife's prior resistance, rooted in her *walian* role, dissolved in the aftermath. His conversion catalyzed Minahasa's Protestant surge, with Langowan emerging as a hub by 1850.

His alliance with Schwarz deepened into mentorship; the missionary, who died in 1859 and was buried in Langowan, praised Tawalijn's ""cosmopolitan"" bearing as a bridge for inculturation, blending biblical ethics with Minahasan communalism, laying the foundations for **Gereja Masehi Injili Minahasa (GMIM)**. Tawalijn died in 1880 and left an indelible imprint on his lineage; through his descendants, including son Philip Frederik Laurens Sigar and granddaughter Dora Marie Sigar, he became the great-great-grandfather of Indonesia's eighth president, Prabowo Subianto, whose 2024 pilgrimage to ancestral graves in Langowan underscores the enduring fusion of Minahasan Protestantism, colonial militarism, and modern nationalism. Today, a copper statue of Schwarz in GMIM Schwarz Sentrum Langowan, renovated under Prabowo's defense ministry, gazes toward Sigar's unmarked influence, a silent testament to how one man's conversion midwifed a regional identity forged in faith, firepower, and fortitude.

# 4. Tamanggung Ambo Nikodemus Jaya Negara: The First Bridge to Dayaks in Kalimantan's Rivers

*Tamanggung* Ambo Nikodemus Jaya Negara, born in the mid-19th century in a riverside village along the Kahayan River in what is now Central Kalimantan, inherited a mantle of leadership amid the Dayak Ngaju's fractious world in the dense rainforests of Dutch Borneo. As the son of Raden Labih, a pagan *tamanggung* (tribal chief) of Pulau Petak, young Ambo navigated a cosmos where spirits demanded blood sacrifices and inter-clan feuds perpetuated cycles of vengeance. By the 1830s, as European missionaries pierced the interior, Ambo, then a teenager, witnessed the arrival of German RMG evangelist Johann Heinrich Barnstein, who, after landing in Banjarmasin in 1835, ventured upriver to establish Bethabara mission station around Pulau Petak in 1839, the first Protestant outpost in Kalimantan. Barnstein's mission garnered little interest from local Dayaks, who viewed Christianity as a religion of the white men. Ambo, emerging as *tamanggung* of Pulau Petak Ulu (also called Pulau Telo), observed these exchanges with pragmatic curiosity. In 1840, during one of Barnstein's exploratory treks to Gohong, Ambo forged a pivotal bond with Barnstein through a blood brotherhood pact, vowing mutual protection and kinship. This ceremony, rare for outsiders, elevated Barnstein to a brother status among the Dayak, granting him safe passage into Dayak heartlands. For Ambo, it symbolized a gateway to forbidden knowledge. Baptized in 1842, in Palingkau station. Ambo received the name ""Nikodemus.""

Ambo's alliance with Barnstein and the RMG propelled him into the maelstrom of the Banjar War (1859–1863), a cataclysmic clash where his loyalty to the Dutch cemented his role as a linchpin in Borneo's Christian frontier. The war erupted from a succession crisis in the Banjar Sultanate, where young Pangeran Antasari and his loyal commander *Tamanggung* Surapati, backed by Arab traders and disaffected Dayak warlords unleashed a holy war against Dutch ""infidels,"" torching and massacring Europeans in a frenzy that claimed four lives from the RMG mission, including missionaries Roth and Wiegand in Tanggahan. Surapati's forces, swollen by Ngaju levies coerced through holy fervor, warred in the Barito River basin, aiming to expel whites and restore sultanate sovereignty. Ambo, stationed at Ujung Murung, rallied Ngaju warriors under Dutch banners, leveraging his prestige to sway wavering clans from Pulau Telo. His contingents ambushed Surapati's flotillas in hit-and-run raids along Kahayan tributaries, a guerrilla symbiosis with Dutch gunboats that turned the tide by 1862. Nikodemus's ""unwavering fidelity"" earned him a silver-knobbed cane and exemption from corvée from the Dutch.

Appointed *Distriktshoofd* (district chief) of Kuala Kapuas (Pulau Telo) in 1860 by the Dutch resident, Ambo continued his support for Barnstein's mission, with Kuala Kapuas emerging as the center of the emerging Dayak church. From Bethabara, to Palingkau, to Kuala Kapuas, eventually the first church building for what is now **Gereja Kalimantan Evangelis (GKE)** was built in Mandomai, not far from Kuala Kapuas, now known as Gereja Immanuel Mandomai. Tamanggung Ambo Nikodemus Jaya Negara's life wove his personal odyssey into the broader tapestry of Dayak renaissance, from colonial enforcer to harbinger of indigenous agency in a Christianized interior. Critically, his support for missions accelerated socio-economic shifts: Kuala Kapuas seminary produced elders for the budding new church, channeling Dayak youth into teaching and clerkships, igniting pan-Dayak consciousness. Kuala Kapuas would also eventually have its own church, Gereja Hampatung (in Hampatung, Kuala Kapuas). Hampatung would eventually emerge as a significant point for the Dayak church, with much later on in 1935, Gereja Dayak Evangelis (GDE, now GKE) proclaimed in Hampatung, Kuala Kapuas. Yet, shadows linger; some Ngaju oral lore whispers of Tamanggung Ambo as pro-Dutch traitor, bartering souls for trinkets amid Tamanggung Surapati's unavenged ghosts. Today, as GKE's 300 thousand faithful span Kalimantan, Tamanggung Ambo Nikodemus's legacy endures, his blood pact a metaphor for Christianity's capillary infiltration, a covenant in Borneo's emerald veins.

# 5. Jalung Ipui: The Evangelical Elder from Kalimantan's Untamed Northeastern Frontier

Jalung Ipui, *kepala adet bio'* (grand customary chief) of Pujungan, East Kalimantan (served circa 1930-1940/1948), of the Dayak Uma' Alim Kayan subgroup in the remote Pujungan River basin of North Kalimantan's highlands, emerged in the early 20th century as a linchpin in the Christianization of Northeastern Borneo's indigenous peoples. As paramount chief of Long Pujungan, a riverside settlement serving as the gateway to once-uncharted vastness, Ipui navigated a precarious equilibrium: his people, subsisted on swidden rice fields, sago palms and barter trades of rattan and resins with coastal merchants, while fending off nomad encroachments and the sporadic violence of Kenyah-Kayan feuds that claimed dozens in ambushes. In 1929, American missionary George E. Fisk of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) ventured into Northeast Kalimantan, intent on piercing the ""dark interior"" that maps still rendered as terra incognita. Fisk's initial forays from Balikpapan up the Mahakam River yielded scant fruit, prompting a relocation to Tanjung Selor, Bulungan's humid outpost, where Fisk bartered gospel tracts for blowpipe demonstrations, forging tentative bonds with Kayan traders ferrying gaharu agarwood downriver.

Their paths converged serendipitously somewhen between 1929 and 1931: Ipui had journeyed to Tanjung Selor with his retinue to enroll his sons in the Dutch mission school, a pragmatic bid for literacy. Introduced to Fisk by a Minahasan teacher named Bapak Karua, Ipui became interested in Fisk's evangelization effort. Fisk asked Ipui to pray and preached about Christ. At the time, Ipui was reluctant to convert, though he had a pretty deep and profound impression on Fisk and the meeting. Later in 1931, Ipui accepted Christianity, and along with 220 of his people, got baptized in the Bahau River.

After his conversion, Ipui became a chief partner to Fisk's mission in the harsh untamed frontiers of Northeastern Kalimantan, his influence as paramount chief quelled resistance from others and persuaded other chiefs to accept Christianity. In 1932, three congregations have been established in Pujungan: Long Metep, Long Ketaman, and Ipui's Long Pujungan. With Ipui's help, Fisk appointed seven people to lead those congregations. By 1934-1935, the Bulongan area had seven congregations with approximately 3,000 Christians. Jalung Ipui would continue to evangelize after Fisk left, his conversion laid the foundations for **Gereja Kemah Injil Indonesia (GKII)**, which now has over 500 thousand adherents across Kalimantan, the largest Protestant church on the island.

# 6. Korano Rumfabe: The Hospitable Gate Opener to Papua from Mansinam

*Korano* Rumfabe (also titled ""*Suruhan* Rumfabe"" in some sources) from Mansinam Island, a foundational adat head in the Biak-Numfor archipelago's coastal mosaic, stands as the inaugural indigenous faithful of Christianity in Papua, his 1860s conversions forging an unlikely alliance that made inroads into Papua amid the tidal pulls of Tidore overlordship and inter-clan skirmishes. *Korano* Rumfabe was a local ruler in Mansinam Island, Doreh Bay, then under the overlordship of Tidore (hence his *korano* title, likely derived from Moluccan title *kolano*), his first name is lost to history, since ""Rumfabe"" is most likely *fam* (clan) name. German missionaries German missionaries Carl Wilhelm Ottow and Johann Gottlob Geissler arrived on Mansinam Island in 1855. Their mission was initially met with indifference from the natives.

Within three years, the villagers began to warm to Ottow and Geissler, none more so than the elderly Korano Rumfabe, the revered elder of the prominent Rumfabe clan. It was reported that Rumfabe was the only one who had listened to Ottow's advice during the disease outbreak, prayed together, and attended services regularly, occasionally asking questions about Christianity. The two became close friends, though by the time of Ottow's death in 1862, Rumfabe remained not a Christian, though Ottow's reports pointed that Rumfabe at least viewed Christianity fondly. Then on Pentecost 1869, Korano Rumfabe, at the time around seventy years old, finally received baptism. Geissler, who baptized Rumfabe, noted that Rumfabe spoke of Ottow as being the person who laid to Rumfabe ""the good foundation for true faith.” Rumfabe would eventually reject what he saw as defiant traditions while preserving the essence of Papuan identity, and died three years later in 1872. His conversion refuted any whisper that Ottow had labored in vain.

Not much else is known about Korano Rumfabe (and unfortunately, I can't even find his photo as of now). His baptism, while a testament to Ottow and Geissler's convictions, didn't particularly produce much impact on the local populace, even his closest relatives. The traditional adat structure in Papua, especially around Mansinam Island and Biak-Numfor region, remained strong. The mission to Papua was far from over, surpassing even the lifetimes of Ottow, Geissler, Rumfabe, and others; and surpassing way beyond Mansinam, eventually crystallizing in 1956 as **Gereja Kristen Injili di Tanah Papua (GKI Tanah Papua)**, declared in Abepura, Hollandia (now Jayapura), today still the largest Protestant church in Papua.

# 7. Siambe' Pong Maramba: The Unyielding Toraja Folk Hero with a Complicated 'Friendship' with the Martyr of Rantepao

*Siambe' Pong* Maramba, *pangrengnge* (paramount ruler) of Rantepao, Tana Toraja (ca. 1850s–1910s), defies easy categorization as a ""friend."" Born into a lineage steeped in power as the son of Nek Lai’ Pali’ and Sia Indok Mayung Allo, he traced his roots to the storied figures, with family ties weaving back to the Sube and Masirri clans near the Singki’ bridge. As a *parengnge*’ of immense wealth and influence, Maramba's exploits echoed through the valleys: he fortified Buntu Pune around 1880 as a bastion of defense, a residence, and a sacred cemetery, repelling Bugis invaders from Bone in fierce battles like *Peristiwa Base Situka*, where his forces, acknowledged as one of the strongest of the era, pushed enemies back to Alang-alang at the cost of heavy Toraja lives. His resistance against Dutch colonial encroachment burned fiercely, marked by guerrilla tactics and unyielding defense of adat customs, yet it was complicated by a tense alliance with fellow chief, the renowned *Pong* Tiku. The two, once brothers in arms against the foreigners, clashed in a brief civil war, only to seal the ""*Perjanjian Buntu Pune*"" pact, uniting to expel the Dutch.

Later on, after the war, Maramba's world intersected stormily with the missionary Antonie Aries van de Loosdrecht, whose arrival in 1913 aboard the S.S. Reynst sparked both cooperation and suspicion. Meeting on the voyage to Palopo alongside Puang Tarongko, Maramba, ever the pragmatic leader, endorsed the building of at least six schools in Rantepao, seeing education as a tool for his people's strength amid colonial pressures. Yet despite a hospitable friendship between the two, van de Loosdrecht's letters branded Maramba as a man so difficult to influence, his reluctance to embrace Christianity rooted in a profound fidelity to the local ancient faith Aluk Todolo. Maramba also reportedly asked van de Loosdrecht to sell his wife, Alida van de Loosdrecht, a practice that was quite common in Torajaland. Pong Maramba was noted as being an 'old guard' of ancient Toraja customs, his stature as a Toraja folk hero continuing to fill the Dutch with anxiety (especially since even despite his friendship with van de Loosdrecht, Maramba remained steadfast in his anti-Dutch stance, planning subsequent resistance efforts). This air of discomfort eventually escalated when whispers grew revolving on Maramba's land grabs through intimidation in Salu, Tandi Tulak, and beyond; slave trading for weapons; and involvement in inciting unrest against the Dutch; all to the scorn of van de Loosdrecht himself and the Dutch.

Eventually, Pong Maramba, the infamous Toraja folk hero, was arrested by Dutch colonial authorities with charges of extortion, murder, and slander. Some blamed van de Loosdrecht himself for this, given his personal discomfort with Maramba, though how much of this accusation is true is unknown. A colonial criminal court condemned him in late 1915 to fifteen years' exile in Java, later shifted to Ambon. Maramba's removal stripped away the ""old guard"" resistors, fueling a chain of events that would eventually lead to van de Loosdrecht's 1917 murder in Bori' by Pong Massangka, another lord, and his allies. Their motive was reported to be related to resentment against all white men because of gambling restrictions, and the exile of Toraja great men, especially Maramba. Reportedly, however, van de Loosdrecht's successor, the missionary Belksma, continued to ask for help from Rev. Wesseldijk in Ambon to 'guide' Maramba spiritually. In 1919, Pong Maramba died in Ambon, unreconciled to the faith that sought to claim him, his body later returned by Dutch warship to Rantepao for a funeral of unparalleled grandeur around 1920, one of the most lavish in Toraja's history, a final roar of adat against the empire that broke him. Today, **Gereja Toraja**'s headquarters stand in Rantepao, a reminder of that old, complicated ""friendship"" between an unyielding folk hero and a stranger who became a martyr.",7,1762753389.0,indonesia,4,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Niagara Purple Eagles vs. Delaware State Hornets: A Tale of Two Courts (and Why the Eagles Soar)**

The college basketball world may not be trembling, but the Niagara Purple Eagles vs. Delaware State Hornets matchup on November 10, 2025, offers all the drama of a reality TV showdown. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game is as lopsided as a pancake at a buffet.

---

### Parse the Odds: Implied Probabilities and Spreads

The betting lines scream “Niagara party!” BetMGM has the Purple Eagles as **-5.5-point favorites** with a **moneyline of 1.45**, implying a **59.6% chance of victory**. Delaware State, meanwhile, sits at **+5.5 (2.8 odds)**, translating to a **35.7% implied probability**. For context, Delaware State’s chances of winning are about the same as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich.

The total is set at **137.5 points**, with even odds on over/under. Given Niagara’s defensive improvements (allowing 71.4 PPG last season vs. Delaware State’s 74.3), the **under** feels like a safer bet than leaving your phone on the table at a coffee shop.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Trends, and Road Struggles

Niagara enters this game with a **6-7 home record** from last season, where they averaged **67 points scored and 71.4 allowed**. Their recent win over Binghamton, fueled by Trenton Walters’ **23-point explosion**, shows flashes of promise. Defense is their calling card: they committed just **15.8 fouls per game** last year, suggesting they’ll avoid the free-throw line becoming a revolving door.

Delaware State? Their **3-11 road record** last season reads like a cautio

**April 8th, 2001 — 12:56 a.m.**  
**Tokyo, Japan. District 13.**

It was a silent night.  
The lights of the shops had gone out hours ago; the wind drifted through the narrow alleys like a whisper, and rain slid down the glass towers as if the sky itself were weeping.  
Tokyo slept… or pretended to.

Beneath that fragile calm, two species shared the same city—two shapes of life wearing the same face.  
Humans, who filled the world with noise, and **Ghouls**, who lurked where the light refused to reach.  
Once dismissed as urban legends, they had become the living nightmare of the metropolis.

Their bodies looked human.  
Their blood ran red like anyone’s.  
But their essence was different.  
Human flesh was the only food their bodies could accept; everything else was poison.  
Their eyes betrayed them: sclera black as tar, pupils glowing red—predators masquerading as people.

Inside them lived a weapon of flesh: the **Kagune**.  
A predatory organ, neither bone nor muscle, yet both.  
It burst forth from their backs like a living shadow, fluid and deadly.  
Some called it a curse.  
Others, evolution.  
But for every Ghoul, the Kagune was both hunger and identity.

Such was Tokyo in the spring of 2001—  
a city split between the seen and the unseen,  
a peace so thin it could tear at the sound of a single siren.

That night, however, the silence felt different.  
In a small, half-lit clinic on the edge of District 13, a woman screamed through the storm.

>

Sweat poured down her face as the clock struck **12:56 a.m.**  
And then, through the pain and the thunder, a cry was heard—a newborn’s cry.

A child had been born.  
Ordinary, at first glance.

They named him **Kazuki**.  
A name meaning *harmony*, *first son*, *tree*.  
Words that, in time, would become the cruelest irony of all.

Outside, the rain kept falling, washing the city’s blood down the drains.  
And somewhere, in the depths of Tokyo, a pair of eyes opened for the first time—  
and the world’s silence began to die with him.

# Prologue — The Birth of Silence (Part 2)

Six years later.

The sun rose over District 13 with its usual gray light, washing the city in a dull, metallic hue.  
Children walked to school in groups, laughing, carrying umbrellas against the drizzle.  
And among them was a boy who never laughed.

**Kazuki Hayato.**

He walked alone, small hands gripping his backpack straps, his dark eyes half-lidded, his expression quiet—too quiet for a six-year-old.

His parents had died a year ago.  
A “car accident,” they said.  
Everyone around him repeated it like a rehearsed prayer, as if saying it enough times would make it true.  
But even then, Kazuki knew something didn’t add up.

>

Their whispers trailed behind him like ghosts.

Kazuki’s new guardian, a man named **Ren**, had been his father’s “friend.”  
At least, that’s what the papers said.  
In truth, Ren was nothing more than a drunk, a man who smelled of cheap alcohol and bitterness.  
He would lash out for no reason—words first, fists second.

Kazuki learned to stay quiet, to endure, to disappear into corners.  
Every bruise taught him silence; every insult, patience.  
He stopped crying long before he stopped hurting.

There was only one thing that still gave him peace: **chess.**  
Ren, for all his cruelty, had taught him how to play.  
Maybe he saw himself as the king—untouchable, protected by pawns.  
But Kazuki loved the pawns most.  
The weak, the overlooked, the ones who moved one square at a time and still reached the end.

That morning, after yet another parent-teacher meeting Ren didn’t attend, Kazuki made up his mind.  
He wouldn’t go back home.  
Not this time.  
Not ever again.

He slipped out of school through a side gate only a few students knew about—a hidden path leading to a quiet street.  
He’d heard rumors from a friend, **Souta**, about a woman who lived nearby, a “lady” who gave sweets to the kids who visited.  
Souta had gone there once and never returned.

Even then, Kazuki’s young heart believed in small hopes.  
Maybe she would help him.  
Maybe she would let him stay.

The mansion stood at the end of the road like something torn out of a forgotten fairytale—tall, pale walls wrapped in climbing roses, gates black as midnight.  
When Kazuki pressed the doorbell, the sound echoed through the air like the beginning of something irreversible.

The gate clicked open on its own.  
A mechanical hum, followed by silence.

He hesitated only for a moment, then stepped inside.

The garden was too perfect, the air too still.  
He reached the front door just as it opened from the inside.

And there she was.

A woman stood framed by the warm light of the hall.  
Long straight hair that brushed her waist, crimson glasses, a white dress threaded with red roses.  
Her skin was pale—porcelain pale—and her beauty felt unreal, cold, delicate, wrong.

But her eyes... her eyes were **green**, vivid and alive, like a predator’s hidden behind elegance.

>

Kazuki’s voice trembled.

>

The woman tilted her head, studying him. For a moment, her gaze seemed to pierce right through his soul. Then she smiled—gentle, almost motherly.

>

Kazuki nodded, relief softening his expression for the first time in years.

>

>

That night, she gave him food and coffee far too bitter for a child.  
He didn’t complain.  
He was too happy to have warmth, even for one night.

>

Her lips curved into a small, teasing smile.

>

Kazuki turned crimson.

>

Kiyomi laughed, and for a fleeting moment, she looked human.  
But as the laughter faded, her eyes lingered on him—too long, too focused.

>

The boy blinked, suddenly dizzy.  
His vision blurred.  
His heartbeat slowed.

Kiyomi’s face was the last thing he saw before darkness took him.  
Her lips moved, mouthing words he couldn’t hear, yet somehow they branded themselves into his mind forever:

**“Washuu… Hayato… we’ll meet again, little boy with eyes as black as your future.”**

# Prologue — The Birth of Silence (Final Part)

Darkness.  
Cold.  
Silence.

Kazuki dreamed of rain.  
Of streets that shone like mirrors, of voices that called his name from somewhere far away.  
Sometimes he saw flashes—hands reaching for him, a woman’s green eyes, the sound of glass breaking.  
Then… nothing.

When he opened his eyes, he was lying in a narrow alley, wrapped in filthy rags and the smell of rust.  
The rain hadn’t stopped. It hadn’t stopped for days.  
Or maybe, for him, it had never stopped at all.

He didn’t know where he was.  
He didn’t know who he was.  
A small tag pinned to his shirt read one word, half–washed away by rainwater:

**Kazuki.**

The rest was gone.

His stomach twisted in pain. Hunger—raw, deep, animal.  
He searched the trash around him, shoving pieces of bread into his mouth, only to vomit them out moments later.  
The taste was unbearable. His body rejected it violently, as if it weren’t food at all.

Hours passed. The hunger didn’t fade—it *grew.*  
It burned in his veins, a whisper crawling under his skin.

He stumbled out of the alley and into the streets, dizzy, trembling, desperate.  
The city lights blurred into streaks of color; voices echoed without meaning.  
He didn’t notice the man until he bumped into him—a drunk, angry, shouting something Kazuki couldn’t understand.  
The man grabbed him by the collar, struck him, cursed him.

And then—

—something inside Kazuki snapped.

His left eye burned, the sclera darkened, his pupil flared crimson.  
The air filled with the scent of blood, and something alive crawled out of his back—fluid, crimson, beautiful, terrible.

The man’s scream was short.

By the time Kazuki realized what he had done, it was already over.  
The alley was silent again, except for his ragged breathing.  
Blood dripped down his chin.  
The hunger was gone.

He looked at his hands, trembling.  
The realization came slowly, heavy as death.

>

The answer never came.

Only the rain—endless, cold, and indifferent—washing away the blood of the first man he’d ever eaten.

That night, somewhere in the labyrinth of Tokyo, a new ghoul was born.  
One with eyes black as night and a hunger that would change everything.

And thus began the story of **Kazuki Washuu**,  
the boy who would grow into a monster,  
and the monster who would learn what it meant to be human.

well yeah, this is just the prologue, im a spanish writter so i apologize if my english is not good enough. 

For anyone wondering, I like using AI to help me write my stories.  
What I do myself is all the **structuring**—the plot arcs, characters, worldbuilding, and overall direction.  
But when it comes to the **actual chapters**, I let AI write them, because I enjoy not only creating the story but also experiencing it as a reader.  
Even though I already know the structure and key moments, I never know exactly how the AI will bring them to life, and that’s part of the fun.

However, the **prologue** was written entirely by me; the AI only helped refine it by adding the tone and atmosphere I specifically asked for.

I’m searching for a connection that isn’t afraid to bleed a little — a love that drinks deeply from passion and mystery alike.

I want something like his — like Dracula’s: eternal hunger, devotion that borders on madness, a bond that feels like both damnation and salvation. A love that lures and consumes, where words taste like confession and silence feels electric.

If you understand that love isn’t always soft, that sometimes it’s teeth and trembling and trust in the dark — then maybe you and I are already dancing at the edge of it.

About me: By day, I’m all softness — I tend my garden, get lost in novels, and find peace in quiet corners of antique shops. I believe in the sacredness of small rituals: morning coffee, the smell of rain, the comfort of a sleeping pet curled against me. But beneath that gentle surface, there’s a current — a yearning for something more primal, something that doesn’t play by daylight’s rules.

I’m drawn to old souls and untamed hearts — those who know how to savor stillness and intensity in equal measure. Someone who can speak in poetry or silence, who understands that love can be both sanctuary and storm.

If your heart beats a little faster under moonlight… if you crave connection that feels timeless and slightly dangerous… come find me. Let’s see if the night recognizes us. 🦇",1,1762752781.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

They’re not chasing validation or you know just textbook marketing. I think they are chasing culture. The way all of them are are talking, designing, and even hiring feels different.

For example:

* Sleepy Owl turned coffee into a lifestyle instead of just a product.
* The Whole Truth is too honest which is becoming its packaging.
* Lenskart is trying to evolve from just selling specs to having them is a flex.
* Misfits Soda is trying to redefine how something can be all healthy, tasty and cool.
* Even newer D2C brands like Bare Necessities or Better&Co are using storytelling instead of shouting offers.

Feels like the new growth metric isn’t just GMV, it’s more inclined towards cultural relevance.

I am honestly quite open minded. I am not someone whos easily bothered by another persons lifestyle choices when they do not effect me. I believe all of us, even those who some of us deem perfect all have flaws. Therefore, I also believe in the idea that you accept people for who they are and not who they can or will be. The idea that, if this person never changes, I am still willing to keep them in my life. 

Of course, we all have a fatal flaw. A flaw that makes people decide where we stand and if they are willing to accept them.   
  
A little about me: I have two poodles (well one is technically a bichpoo hehe) so it is a major bonus if you have a dog too. I'd love to go on coffee walks or park walks with our dogs and explore what the city has to offer while including our pets. Its getting colder, but not too cold for a cute doggy girls date! Oh, and I'll bring extra pup cups so they too can be part of the coffee shenanigans.

But when I am not looking for things to do with my dogs I love to write for fun. I nearly even got to write a webtoon. I love a good story and I love talking about stories, making new ones and theorizing over movies, books and TV shows. 

Recently I have been wanting to get more into reading as well, so it could be fun to challenge ourselves to read one book a month and catch up on it together (or laugh about how boring it is XD)

Another thing I love are chatting on the phone or OOO virtual movie nights. Even if we are not doing a movie night physically together (because lets be real sometimes you just want to be in your own bed XD). 

But to watch a movie on virtual chat or just on the phone, the fun of simply pressing play at the same time then being a two person peanut gallery- its so fun. Like yes girl, lets dissect df out of this movie like our lives depended on it and crack jokes before its even over. 

And if we do have an in person movie night, well you can guarantee, we are getting all the snacks, all the face masks and matching pajamas :D. 

I also really love traveling, love the ocean, oh and going to Balls. Yes, I mean the type of balls where you dress like a princess and have dances. I also really want to do more fantasy related trips. Such as going to Scotland to explore Castles, going to more balls in Europe and so forth. I have also been recently been trying to get back into the gym soooo possibly a gym buddy baddie moment :D

*Other things about me, as I only mention these things because I do think it is important to have lifestyle matches when it comes to friends or just similar fundamentals:*  
  
1. I do not drink, smoke, or do any kinds of drugs

2. I don't go to parties (simply more of an introvert, but I am not opposed to going to them as long as everyone is friendly)

3.  I do not plan to have children, so I am looking forward to being the bougie rich aunty

4. I do care a lot about platonic love and familial connections greatly. And it is very important to me. Id love to meet similar girls of that nature or can at least understand that.

5. I am big on communication. Something bothers you, tell me. Something you are unsure of, tell me. 

  
If you read all that, bless your heart XDDD. I know it was a long post. My apologiess. But I wanted to make it as detailed as I could without making a eight page essay. But yeah, I am a pretty easy going, shy but talkative af girl. IF this interest you at all, lets chat and get to know each other a bit :D And who knows, we may just find a new bestie!

Never in a million years would I have thought that this would happen to me but shit happens. So everything started sa isang dating app (TNDR). Nag dating app ako mainly because nagbabaka sakali ako, I’ve heard na may success stories din naman so nag try ako. Then nakita ko tong taong to, JAMES ang name nya sa tndr acct nya.  Pagtingin ko sa acct niya (OO ALAM KO SASABIHIN NIYO - PANGET naman bakit pumatol? Hindi ko din alam!) He messaged and said if we could talk sa whatsapp since hindi daw siya lagi active sa tndr acct nya and 4days pa lang DAW siya dun. So I gave him my # and he called. When I heard his voice, ok naman. Pabiro ko pa nga sinabi sa friend ko “Naku! Maganda boses. Panget to. Haha.” He then asked if we could meet up for coffee, OFF AKO THAT DAY AND WALA NAMAN AKONG GANAP SOOO, pumayag ako. Sabi ko pa nga sa friend ko “para pag hndi kmi nag-click, hindi na tumagal convo. Wala na ako energy.” So nagkita kami and then we went to this coffee shop, “TINATANGI CAFE”. He asked kung ano daw order ko sabi ko kape lang since busog pa ako, after lunch ksi kami nag meet. Tapos nung magbabayad na, sabi nya he left his wallet sa car, will pay back later. Dun pa lang, nakakutob na ako pero hinayaan ko nlng. Kape pa lang naman. We stayed sa cafe a bit longer than expected kasi kwentuhan kami. Nagkwento sya sa mga past nya and all tpos I asked if meron siyang FB acct. Sabi niya hindi siya active sa socials ksi nga may naninira sa kanya dun. Grabe daw paninira sa kanya na affected na daily life niya. “Crazy X GFs and mga naka match nya before na hindi nag end ng maayos ksi personally di nya daw gusto si girl pero si girl daw wanted more so sinisiraan sya na manloloko daw eme eme.” Gusto ko na siya hanapin sa FB nun time na yun kasi gsto ko makita, kaso ung signal dun sobrang hina. May wifi pero loading lang. Tpos he insited na magkwentuhan nlng kami, mas ok daw marinig ko everything coming from him. He is saying all the right things. He is so good with words. Tapos the way siya makipag usap, talagang tinitignan ka niya sa mata. Extra sweet, extra caring. Madadala ka talaga. Sabi ko pa nga “THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE”. May kutob na ako na di maganda, pero hinayaan ko lang. He then invited me to his place, malapit lang daw. Nabili daw nya yun pero he only stays there on the weekends kasi dun siya sa kapatid niya nagsstay sa QC dahil andun work niya. Ipapakilala daw niya ako sa mom niya. Tpos nagpunta na nga kami sa “bahay” niya and he introduced me to his mom. Sobrang welcoming pa nga ni mother, nagluto pa meryenda. Tpos nakita ko ung “SHOE COLLECTION” niya. Sabi ko pa nga ang dami ah! Ung iba daw dun matagal na, tinatago lang nya ksi nga collectors item daw. Hindi na kmi nagtagal sa bahay kasi dinala nya pa ako sa “GLASS HOUSE” para daw ma-pasyal naman niya ako and ganda daw vibes dun, first time daw niya dun and matagal na niya gusto puntahan. Sabi pa niya mag roadtrip kami. Ipapasyal nya ako everywhere. Tapos nag dinner kmi. He offered to pay naman for our dinner. Kwentuhan lang kami hanggang sa nag aya na ako umuwi. Binaba ko siya sa sakayan bus kasi uuwi daw sya ng QC. Tpos kinabukasan, may inasikaso ako. Nung pagtingin ko ng wallet ko ksi may babayaran ako, nakita ko na nawawalan ako ng pera (₱3600). Dun na ako parang natulala tapos pilit kong inisip kung ano ngyari the day before. Prior kami magkita ni “JAMES”. Nagpagas ako and nakita ko pa dun cash ko. I used my card pang gas. Tpos sa coffee naman, may nakahiwalay ako na cash sa coin purse ko so aun ang ginamit ko. Tpos sa dinner, siya naman nagbayad and hindi ko na dala bag ko nun since sabi nya he will be paying for dinner. Naalala ko dun sa tinatangi cafe nag CR ako and iniwan ko bag ko sa kanya. Malay ko bang nanakawan ako. I confronted him sa chat tpos sabi lang niya “Baka na misplace mo.” Tapos parang wala lang sa knya. Kaya pala malakas ang loob mag offer na magbayad ng dinner, NINAKAWAN NA PALA AKO AND PERA KO GAMIT NIYA.

That’s when I decided to search him sa FB and may nakita akong post regarding sa kanya (attached photo dito) tpos nag msg ako dun sa nag post and dun ko na nalaman ung MO nya and years na niyang ginagawa ito. Madami kaming girls ang sabay sabay niyang kinakausap and lahat sa dating app lang niya nakilala. Viber/Whatsapp ang gamit nya para makpg usap. LOVE ang tawag niya samin lahat siguro para hindi siya malito. Majority of us, dinala niya diyan sa TINATANGI CAFE and sa GLASS HOUSE. Yung iba dinadayo niya pa sa malayong lugar, after niya makakubra ng pera sa pagnanakaw sa ibang girls or after niya magpasend or transfer dahil ”SHORT” na daw siya. Sa ibang girls na matagal na niya nakakausap, after ilang days daw ng usap nila nagsstart na siya magsabi na “Love short ako. Wala pa sahod. Sira paymaya ko. Floating pa ung transfer ko. Bawi ako sayo sa sahod. Nagugutom na ako love, dipa ako kumakain since kahapon. Wala ako pamasahe papnta work (FYI: wala siya work). Tight lang daw ngayon sa budget kasi sole caretaker ng nanay niya. Siya sagot sa meds ng nanay niya. Malala ung nagsasabi siya na-ospital/namatayan siya kamag-anak.” (FYI: BROKE B*TCH tong si Jack at walang trabaho. Ang sabi niyang work niya eh Field Operation Supervisor, yun pala taga palit lng ng gulong sa servitek nung pandemic pa. Palamunin lang ng nanay niya ngayon at namamalimos sa mga babae niya para lang may pangkain. Tapos halos lahat pala ng babae niya dinala niya dun sa bahay nila (hindi pala sa kanya, sa pamangkin nya) pinapakilala niya sa nanay niya. Ibat ibang babae. Meron pa iba sa umaga, iba sa gabi. To the point nga na nakikipag kita siya at hindi na nakakapag palit ng clothes dahil sobrang hectic sched nya sa pakikipag meet. Kinukunsinti ng nanay niya ung pagdadala nya iba iba babae sa bahay. Tpos ung mga sapatos niya? Lahat un pinapabili niya sa mga naging babae nya. Sasabihin niya malapit na bday niya (Every month na lang bday niya). From different places mga girls nya. He already has 3 kids from different women and lahat wala siya sustento sa mga anak niya. Paano ko nalaman lahat? MADAMI AKO NAKAUSAP NA MGA NAGING BIKTIMA NIYA and we exchanged photos and screenshots. Di lang ako nag-iisa. MADAMI KAMI. Thankful pa din ako na once lang kmi nag meet at hindi na humaba, kinabukasan nalaman ko din lahat. He even denied it and sabi sinisiraan lang daw siya and wag daw ako maniwala and paborito niyang line saming lahat - “LET’S WORK THIS OUT LOVE. Wag ka sana papa apekto sa mga naninira sakin.” Masyado na mahaba to, diko na madetalye lahat. If isa ka sa mga nabiktima nya, you can message me for questions.

AND NOW HE IS ATTACKING YUNG ISA SAMIN. Siguro wala na siya mabiktima sa tndr at wala na siya pangkain kaya iba na atake gingawa niya. Some of us made posts kasi to spread awareness regarding JACKZON LAGARAS COLEGADO AKA JAMES (on TNDR) para wala na siya mabiktima pa na iba. Si satanas nga mismo nahihiya na sa ginagawa niya. There are posts in other soc.med regarding him, search niyo lang name niya. Tapos he recently made a post dito sa reddit telling lies para siraan ung isang girl but it was removed by the mod (Thankyou!) tapos lumipat na siya sa FB. He made a fake profile sa FB under the name JHEMA REYES and nagpost ng kasinungalingan online para ipahiya yung girl. If ever makita niyo yung post, be kind dun sa girl na naka post and just report ung post. Managot dapat ung managot. If ever tatanungin niyo bakit hindi namin ireklamo? Meron na pending and brgy blotter sa kanya. Kaso welcome to the Philippines. Not enough claims to put him behind bars. Just please, ladies. Wag kayo papaloko, lalo na sa JACKZON COLEGADO na to.

I'm moving within the week, with my husband who is a born and raised local. I know there are a lot of options, for quite literally everything in Vegas. I am from IN and am looking for things to do to keep me busy & get myself out of my small midwest town shell.

Some things that I am interested in: Art, the pagan community (if you dont have anything kind to say ignore the post), reading (looking for book clubs), cooking & baking, I love coffee shops, I really want to learn how to crochet & I have always wanted to take a self defense class. I dont have many hobbies, and I am a very creative person. Which is a shame with that considered, and I really want that to change. 

I've lived in only two area's of IN for all of my 25yrs of life, so I'm very nervous to be in a big city like this. & am worried about making friends (mostly). So really anything that would make that a little easier would be great. Maybe an art class where I am taught to paint or sculpt? & when I say class I mean, I dont want to pay a fee for every time I attend. Pay a membership or something, yk like an actual class that meets weekly (if thats even a thing for adults).

- her galentines party

The door to Liam's cramped office was half-open, and I could see...

""Get. Out.""
——————
The cupcakes were perfect.
I'd woken at five that morning, way before both the alarm and the sun, and pulled butter from the fridge to soften. I creamed it with sugar until my arm ached, folded in Madagascar vanilla bean paste I'd ordered specially, piped each cupcake with the kind of precision I usually reserved for parent-teacher conference notes. Eighteen identical swirls of buttercream, each one a tiny work of art.
The kind of perfection that requires you to ignore certain things. Like how when I'd asked Liam last night if we had enough powdered sugar, he'd said ""mmm-hmm"" without looking up from his phone. Like how he'd been working late more nights than not this month. But that's what you do when you love someone: you bake at five in the morning and tell yourself the distraction means he's tired, not distant.
By the time I'd finished, the sun was up and I was due at school. I packed them carefully in a carrier container, settled them in the passenger seat like precious cargo, and brought them to work with me, storing them safely in the teacher's lounge refrigerator.
Now, three hours after the last bell had rung and the final student had bolted out the door for summer vacation, I was finally driving across town with the kind of giddy anticipation that made me feel ridiculous. I was twenty-seven years old, a second-grade teacher with a master's degree, and I was excited about frosting.
But Liam would understand. He always understood.
That's what I told myself, anyway. It's easier than admitting you've spent years understanding someone who might not be trying to understand you back.
I tried to focus on the good day I'd had: submarine-themed bulletin boards rolled into tubes, construction paper fish recycled, twenty-five end-of-year cards from parents tucked into my bag. Most of them mentioned the wedding. So happy for you, Miss Hayes! and Congratulations on your special day! and one from Dakota's mom that included a gift card to Williams-Sonoma with a note: For your new kitchen!
I'd cried in my empty classroom reading that one.
Summer stretched ahead like a gift. Two months before I had to be back, before I had to remember twenty-five new names and hang new decorations and pretend I had my life together for seven-year-olds who still believed in magic.
And, a few weeks before that, I'd be married.
Station 47 was quiet when I pulled up. Friday afternoon, the trucks gleaming in their bays, everything tidied and hosed down. I grabbed the cupcakes and used the key Liam had given me two years ago, the one that let me slip past the public doors and head upstairs. He'd said I should feel at home here, that the guys loved when I stopped by. I almost never used it. Usually I just texted when I was coming, but today I wanted to surprise him.
The common room was empty, but I could hear voices upstairs.
I climbed the steps carefully, container balanced in both hands. The buttercream had set perfectly during the drive. Liam was going to love these. We'd narrowed the wedding cake down to two flavors, and this vanilla bean was the frontrunner, but I wanted him to taste it one more time before I called the baker we'd hired for the actual cake and⁠—
Voices drifted down from upstairs. Liam's voice, warm and low. Good. He was here.
Then another voice. Female, laughing.
I kept climbing.
Jenna, probably. The new transfer who'd joined the station in December. She was nice. I'd met her at the Christmas party, watched her nurse a single beer all night and ask thoughtful questions about my classroom. She'd seemed nervous, eager to fit in.
Their voices got clearer as I reached the top of the stairs. Liam said something I couldn't make out, and Jenna laughed again, brighter this time.
Then... silence.
I stopped on the landing.
The silence stretched for a heartbeat. It wasn't the comfortable quiet of people working side-by-side, but... something else. Something that made my chest tighten.
There was a rustle of fabric. A sharp intake of breath.
My feet moved before my brain caught up. I moved up the steps, then into the hallway. The door to his cramped office was half-open, and I could see...
I could see...
Liam's hand was in Jenna's hair. His other hand, the one that had held mine just this morning, the one that would slip a ring on my finger in five weeks, was cupped against her jaw, tilting her face up to his. Her hands were fisted in his shirt, the navy station t-shirt I'd folded fresh from the dryer last Sunday. They were pressed together against his desk, and he was pecking her the way he used to peck me. The way he hadn't pecked me in...
God, how long?
How long had it been since he'd pecked me like that? Like he was desperate for it? Like he couldn't breathe without it?
Jenna made a soft, breathy sound, and Liam's fingers tightened in her hair. Something inside my chest cracked open.
His mouth moved to her neck. Her head tilted back, exposing her throat, and his free hand dropped to her waist, sliding under the hem of her shirt. She arched into him, and he lifted her—actually lifted her—onto the edge of his desk. The same desk where we'd eaten Thai food two weeks ago, where I'd sat and told him about the end-of-year field trip while he'd smiled and nodded and said all the right things.
Her legs wrapped around his waist.
His hips pressed forward.
It was too much. My fingers went dead, and the container slipped from my hands.
It hit the floor with a plastic crack that sounded like a gunshot in the quiet hallway. Eighteen perfect cupcakes exploded across the linoleum, buttercream and vanilla bean and hours of work scattered in a mess of plastic and frosting.
They broke apart.
Liam's head whipped toward the doorway. His face went white. Then red. Then something worse: guilty.
""Piper—""
His voice felt like barbed wire someone had tightened around my heart.
I turned and ran.
My feet hit the stairs too fast, and I grabbed the railing to keep from falling. Behind me, Liam was still calling my name.
""Piper, wait! Please, Piper!""
But I couldn't stop. Wouldn't stop.
The common room blurred past. The bay doors were open and the sunlight was too bright, too normal, too much like the world hadn't just split open. My hands shook so hard I dropped my keys twice trying to unlock my car. The metal bit into my palm when I finally got the door open.
""Piper!""
Liam was in the doorway now, shirt untucked, hair disheveled. Looking exactly like what he was.
I threw myself into the driver's seat, slammed the door and locked it. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely get the key in the ignition.
He reached my car and pressed his palms against the window. ""Please. Please just let me explain!""
The engine turned over.
I looked at him then. Really looked at him. At the man I'd been planning to marry in five weeks. The man I'd woken up at five in the morning to bake for.
His mouth was still red from pecking her.
I put the car in reverse and drove away.
I didn't remember the drive home.
One moment I was pulling out of Station 47's parking lot, and the next I was sitting in my car outside our apartment building, engine still running, hands locked on the steering wheel. The sun was still shining. A woman walked past with a stroller. Somewhere nearby, someone was mowing their lawn.
The world was exactly the same as it had been an hour ago. Except it really wasn't.
My phone buzzed in my purse.
Then again. And again.
I turned off the engine and ignored it.
The stairs to our second-floor apartment felt steeper than usual. My legs were shaking. Or, maybe, I was shaking. I couldn't tell anymore. I got my key in the lock on the third try, pushed the door open, and locked the deadbolt behind me.
The little dining table sat under the window, one chair still pulled out. Liam's jacket hung over the back of it, and I stopped in the doorway, staring. Navy blue fleece, worn at the elbows, smelling like smoke and his cologne. He'd thrown it there this morning before leaving for his shift, too distracted to notice it wasn't where it belonged. I'd walked past it a dozen times, barely noticed it.
Now I couldn't look away.
The wedding binder was on the coffee table. Three inches thick, bursting with magazine clippings and fabric swatches and my handwritten notes in the margins.
Ivory vs. cream? Ask about string lights. Liam's cousin is vegetarian, check menu.
Months and months of planning. A year of being engaged.
And I didn't even know how long he'd been lying.
My purse slipped off my shoulder and hit the floor. I walked past the binder, past his jacket, into the kitchen. As if by instinct, I opened the fridge. Our cake-tasting leftovers were still in there. Neat little slices wrapped in cling film, each labeled in my handwriting. Lemon poppyseed. Chocolate hazelnut. Vanilla bean.
Vanilla bean was the frontrunner, the flavor I'd spent the morning perfecting, as if precision could hold everything together. We were supposed to do a final test with the cupcakes, make the choice official. But he'd been so busy lately that I told myself I was being thoughtful, not desperate, when I brought them to him instead.
The cupcakes were probably still scattered across Station 47's linoleum floor. Perfect swirls of buttercream smashed flat, just like everything else I'd thought was solid.
I closed the fridge.
My hands were shaking again. I needed to do something. Needed to move. Needed to...
I pulled open the pantry and started grabbing things. Butter, flour, sugar, baking powder. I didn't know what I was making. Didn't care. I just needed my hands to be busy, needed the routine, needed something that made sense.
Measure. Pour. Mix.
That made sense.
The butter wasn't soft enough but I creamed it anyway, the wooden spoon scraping against the bowl. My phone buzzed on the counter. It was face down, but I could still see the screen lighting up over and over. I ignored it. Cracked eggs one-handed the way I always did, watched the yolks slide into the bowl.
My vision blurred.
I blinked and kept mixing.
The first batch went into the oven. Muffins, I think, or maybe they were supposed to be cupcakes. I didn't remember adding the baking powder. Didn't remember preheating the oven. But the timer was set and the kitchen smelled like vanilla and butter, and for thirty seconds I could almost pretend everything was fine.
Then I saw the engagement photo on the fridge.
Us at the beach last summer, his arm around my waist, both of us laughing at something his brother had said. I'd been so happy that day. We'd stayed until sunset, and he'd pecked me while the waves crashed behind us and told me he couldn't wait to marry me.
I yanked the photo down and shoved it in the junk drawer.
The timer went off and I pulled the muffins out. They were lopsided, too dark on top. Burnt. I stared at them for a long moment, then dumped the entire pan in the trash.
I leaned against the counter, breathing hard.
Jenna.
I'd met her at the Christmas party. Six months ago. She'd seemed nice, really. Quiet, and a little awkward in the way new people are when they're trying to fit in with an established group. She'd asked me about my classroom, complimented the scarf I was wearing. I'd liked her.
Had it started then? At the party, with me standing right there?
Or later. Maybe January. February. March.
How long?
I didn't even know how long.
I tried to remember March. Parent-teacher conferences. The spring musical rehearsals. I'd stayed late three nights a week helping with costumes. Liam had been working overtime, or so he'd said. Double shifts, budget meetings, a training seminar in Sacramento. It made sense, didn't it? He was on track for Station Captain, buried in overtime and leadership courses and whatever else would make him look indispensable.
God, how many of those late-nights had been lies?
I thought of Jenna.
She was younger than me. Twenty-four, maybe twenty-five. Prettier, probably. I'd barely looked at her today, but I remembered her from the party. Long dark hair, athletic build. She was the kind of girl who made ponytails look intentional and sweat look good. She probably didn't stress-bake at two in the morning. Probably didn't have flour permanently embedded under her fingernails.
She was a firefighter. She did what Liam did, understood his world in a way I never could. When he talked about calls and protocols and the weird hierarchy of station life, she got it. She lived it.
I taught second graders how to share crayons.
My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them flat against the counter.
What did she have that I didn't? What had I done wrong? Was I too boring? Too predictable? Too focused on wedding planning and lesson plans and whether the buttercream ratio was right?
Had he been thinking about her when he pecked me goodbye this morning?
Had he been thinking about her every time?
I shoved away from the counter and grabbed the flour again.
Yes, that's what I needed.
More flour. More sugar. More butter.
This time I measured carefully. Like if I could just get the ratios right, everything else would fall into place too.
By the time the second batch went into the oven, my hands were steadier. I started chocolate chip cookies then, the recipe I'd memorized years ago. Cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs. Stir in the flour and⁠—
Three sharp knocks at the door.
I froze, wooden spoon halfway to the bowl.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was muffled through the door, but I'd know it anywhere. ""Piper, please. I know you're in there.""
The doorknob rattled and, just a few seconds after, his key scraped in the lock.
The door opened an inch and caught on the deadbolt.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was closer now, desperate. ""Please. Just let me in.""
I could see him through the gap. His face was pale, his eyes red-rimmed as if he'd been crying. Or maybe he'd just rubbed his eyes to make it look like he had.
""I need to talk to you,"" he said. ""Please, baby. Just open the door.""
Baby.
He'd called Jenna baby too, probably. Whispered it against her neck while his hands slid under her shirt.
""Piper, please.""
I walked to the door, each step deliberate.
He saw me coming and something like relief flooded his face. ""Thank you. Thank you, I just need five minutes to⁠—""
""How long?"" I asked.
His mouth snapped shut.
""How long, Liam?""
""Can we... can we not do this through the door? Please. Just let me come inside and we can sit down and talk like⁠—""
""How long?""
He closed his eyes. ""Piper⁠—""
""Answer the question or leave.""
There was a long silence. I could hear him breathing. Could hear someone walking down the hallway outside, keys jingling. A door opened and closed somewhere. The building settling around us, as if even it was bracing for what came next.
""Since March,"" he said finally.
March.
The word hung in the air between us, heavy and sharp.
March.
That's when I'd started testing cake flavors. Vanilla bean and lemon and champagne-raspberry. I'd made him try all of them, watched him deliberate like it actually mattered which one we chose. He'd pulled me into his lap and pecked buttercream off my lips and said he didn't care about the cake, he just wanted to marry me.
That was March.
""Say something,"" Liam said. ""Please.""
""We picked out invitations in March.""
""I know⁠—""
""I ordered your wedding band. We had your parents over for dinner. Your mom showed me her dress.""
""Piper—""
""You texted me during parent-teacher conferences."" My voice was steady. ""You sent me a photo of a Sacramento sunset, then said you wished I was there to see it.""
He didn't say anything.
""Was she there?"" I asked. ""When you took that photo?""
Silence.
""Was she there, Liam?""
""Yes."" His voice was barely a whisper.
Something cracked inside my chest. Not my heart... no, that had already broken. It was something else. Something that had been holding me together.
I unlocked the deadbolt.
The door swung open and Liam stumbled forward, catching himself on the doorframe. ""Thank you,"" he breathed. ""Thank you, I just need to explain⁠—""
""Get out.""
He froze. ""What?""
""Get your sh-it,"" I said, ""and get out.""
""Piper, no, just listen to me for one second⁠—""
""I don't want to listen."" My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them against my thighs. ""I don't want to hear about how it was a mistake or how you're sorry or how it didn't mean anything. I want you to pack your things and leave.""
""It didn't mean anything,"" he said anyway. ""I swear to God, Piper, she doesn't... you're the one I love. You're the one I want to marry.""
""You don't get to say that to me."" My voice cracked. ""You don't get to stand here and tell me you love me when you've been fu-cking someone else for months.""
""I wasn't... we... we didn't⁠—""
""Don't."" I held up a hand. ""Don't you dare try to tell me what I saw.""
""Okay."" He ran his hands through his dark blond hair, the same gesture he always made when he was stressed. ""Okay. You're right. I'm not going to lie to you anymore. But Piper, please, I made a mistake. A huge, terrible mistake, but we can fix this. We can go to counseling, we can⁠—""
""Get. Out.""
""This is my home too."" His voice shifted. Harder now. ""I'm on the lease, Piper. You can't just kick me out.""
I stared at him.
He was pulling the lease card. Actually standing here, reeking of guilt and another woman's perfume, and pulling the lease card.
""You want to stay here?"" I asked.
""I want us to work this out.""
""You want to stay in this apartment?""
""That's not what I⁠—""
""Fine,"" I said.
""Fine what?""
I turned and walked toward the bedroom. ""Keep it.""
""Piper, what are you⁠—""
I grabbed my duffel bag from the closet and started throwing things into it. Underwear. Bras. T-shirts. My hands were shaking so badly I kept dropping things.
""What are you doing?"" Liam appeared in the doorway. ""Piper, stop.""
I shoved past him to the dresser. Grabbed jeans, leggings, a sweater. I didn't even bother folding any of it, just stuffed it all into the bag.
""You can't just leave,"" he said. ""We need to talk about this.""
""Move.""
""No."" He planted himself in front of the closet. ""Not until you calm down and listen to me.""
""Calm down?"" I looked at him, the man I'd been planning to spend my life with. ""You want me to calm down.""
""This isn't... God, Piper, you're not thinking clearly.""
""I'm thinking very clearly."" I zipped the duffel bag. ""You cheated on me. While I planned our wedding. While I baked you cakes and folded your laundry and told my second-graders about how I was getting married to the best man in the world.""
His face crumpled. ""Piper⁠—""
""You want the apartment?"" I slung the bag over my shoulder. ""It's yours. Enjoy it.""
""Where are you going?""
""Anywhere that isn't here.""
""This is insane,"" he said. ""You're being insane.""
I pushed past him. He grabbed my arm and I jerked away so hard I stumbled.
""Don't touch me.""
""Piper, please⁠—""
I walked to the kitchen, grabbed my purse and my phone and my laptop. The duffel bag was cutting into my shoulder but I didn't care. I just needed to get out and breathe air that didn't smell like him.
Liam followed me to the door. ""You can't just walk away from this. From us. What about the wedding?""
I stopped and turned around.
""What about it?"" I asked.
""We have two hundred people coming. We have deposits. We have⁠—""
""Cancel it.""
""Piper—""
""Or don't. I don't care. Marry Jenna if you want. I'm done.""

my main symptom of histamine intolerance is a very puffy, swollen face - it might be additionally puffed up due to inflammation, idk. I also have stomach issues which I do not pay as much attention to as I should (the face thing - as vain as it sounds - is more important to me. I just don't feel like myself since such a long time).

I recently got tested, my DAO is 14%, my blood histamine 78 ng/ml and I have very low B6. 

Restricting my diet makes me sad - especially because I used to have an eating disorder as a teenager and didn't allow myself to eat many delicious foods which I now *would* eat (would *like to eat*, actually) but which I can't eat anymore due to this issue (what a joke of the universe) - but it's okay-ish, I'm can get used to it. 

what I can't seem to give up though is coffee even though it is really truly damaging me. it might sound crazy but coffee is intertwined with my identity so much - it (at least following my belief) enables me to work on my projects which give me true meaning (and at the time *the only meaning*) in life. quitting it - even for a longer period of time - just leaves me feeling without purpose. I feel horribly depressed and honestly do not know what to do with my time/day.

even if I do quit coffee and eat low histamine, I do not necessarily feel much better (my stomach ache might not be as strong and my face not as puffy as it is *with* coffee) but it is not enough to motivate me to go on. 

deep inside of me I kind of accepted that something is truly wrong with me - and has been wrong all my life - which seperates me from other people and also seperates me from experiences certain positive aspects of life. I kind of accepted that I ""just need to suffer"" (and also accept that I'm ""ugly"") to experience at least a little normality and joy. without that, I'm left *just* suffering. 

I do know though that I cannot go on like this. I feel stuck, like I'm not developing and I'm seriously worried that I might be damaging my body to a point of no reverse. still, I seem to not be able to trust myself to take proper care of myself - like a true addict, when it comes to the decision, I always decide for: meaning, better mood/motivation in/for life, for **coffee**. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here on reddit but writing all this down made me feel a tiny bit better already.

It has been a bane on my existence for years. Finally, I have an answer. My parents had told me long ago that I'm allergic to Antiptryne (Phenazone) since birth (given that it's banned in some countries go figure). Looking through fast food additives, which was a definite trigger no matter the chain, I realized that one of the side effects of sodium acid pryophosphate (baking powder) was nerve damage. Add to this that I was drinking coffee on a daily basis and that food items like chocolate chip cookies also gave me flares. 


In the chemical identification test of tannins, phenazone in an aqueous solution of sodium acid pyrophosphate creates a precipitate of the tannins when tannins are present. Now consider the chemical reaction like an equation with transitive properties, if my body was reacting to Phenazone then there must be some kind of reaction causing the temporary increase in what felt like nerve damage but only localized to the lymphatic system. 


Then I noticed that a similar compound of Phenazone added with caffeine reacts in similar form with tannins. So I cut out caffeine, products with baking powder, and high tannin processed foods like chocolate, tea, and coffee. Boom! No more flares. Just to make sure, after two weeks of no flares I tried the three together within an 8 hour window and the flare came back within two hours of ingesting all three but not until the third ingredient was ingested.

The cupcakes were perfect.
I'd woken at five that morning, way before both the alarm and the sun, and pulled butter from the fridge to soften. I creamed it with sugar until my arm ached, folded in Madagascar vanilla bean paste I'd ordered specially, piped each cupcake with the kind of precision I usually reserved for parent-teacher conference notes. Eighteen identical swirls of buttercream, each one a tiny work of art.
The kind of perfection that requires you to ignore certain things. Like how when I'd asked Liam last night if we had enough powdered sugar, he'd said ""mmm-hmm"" without looking up from his phone. Like how he'd been working late more nights than not this month. But that's what you do when you love someone: you bake at five in the morning and tell yourself the distraction means he's tired, not distant.
By the time I'd finished, the sun was up and I was due at school. I packed them carefully in a carrier container, settled them in the passenger seat like precious cargo, and brought them to work with me, storing them safely in the teacher's lounge refrigerator.
Now, three hours after the last bell had rung and the final student had bolted out the door for summer vacation, I was finally driving across town with the kind of giddy anticipation that made me feel ridiculous. I was twenty-seven years old, a second-grade teacher with a master's degree, and I was excited about frosting.
But Liam would understand. He always understood.
That's what I told myself, anyway. It's easier than admitting you've spent years understanding someone who might not be trying to understand you back.
I tried to focus on the good day I'd had: submarine-themed bulletin boards rolled into tubes, construction paper fish recycled, twenty-five end-of-year cards from parents tucked into my bag. Most of them mentioned the wedding. So happy for you, Miss Hayes! and Congratulations on your special day! and one from Dakota's mom that included a gift card to Williams-Sonoma with a note: For your new kitchen!
I'd cried in my empty classroom reading that one.
Summer stretched ahead like a gift. Two months before I had to be back, before I had to remember twenty-five new names and hang new decorations and pretend I had my life together for seven-year-olds who still believed in magic.
And, a few weeks before that, I'd be married.
Station 47 was quiet when I pulled up. Friday afternoon, the trucks gleaming in their bays, everything tidied and hosed down. I grabbed the cupcakes and used the key Liam had given me two years ago, the one that let me slip past the public doors and head upstairs. He'd said I should feel at home here, that the guys loved when I stopped by. I almost never used it. Usually I just texted when I was coming, but today I wanted to surprise him.
The common room was empty, but I could hear voices upstairs.
I climbed the steps carefully, container balanced in both hands. The buttercream had set perfectly during the drive. Liam was going to love these. We'd narrowed the wedding cake down to two flavors, and this vanilla bean was the frontrunner, but I wanted him to taste it one more time before I called the baker we'd hired for the actual cake and⁠—
Voices drifted down from upstairs. Liam's voice, warm and low. Good. He was here.
Then another voice. Female, laughing.
I kept climbing.
Jenna, probably. The new transfer who'd joined the station in December. She was nice. I'd met her at the Christmas party, watched her nurse a single beer all night and ask thoughtful questions about my classroom. She'd seemed nervous, eager to fit in.
Their voices got clearer as I reached the top of the stairs. Liam said something I couldn't make out, and Jenna laughed again, brighter this time.
Then... silence.
I stopped on the landing.
The silence stretched for a heartbeat. It wasn't the comfortable quiet of people working side-by-side, but... something else. Something that made my chest tighten.
There was a rustle of fabric. A sharp intake of breath.
My feet moved before my brain caught up. I moved up the steps, then into the hallway. The door to his cramped office was half-open, and I could see...
I could see...
Liam's hand was in Jenna's hair. His other hand, the one that had held mine just this morning, the one that would slip a ring on my finger in five weeks, was cupped against her jaw, tilting her face up to his. Her hands were fisted in his shirt, the navy station t-shirt I'd folded fresh from the dryer last Sunday. They were pressed together against his desk, and he was pecking her the way he used to peck me. The way he hadn't pecked me in...
God, how long?
How long had it been since he'd pecked me like that? Like he was desperate for it? Like he couldn't breathe without it?
Jenna made a soft, breathy sound, and Liam's fingers tightened in her hair. Something inside my chest cracked open.
His mouth moved to her neck. Her head tilted back, exposing her throat, and his free hand dropped to her waist, sliding under the hem of her shirt. She arched into him, and he lifted her—actually lifted her—onto the edge of his desk. The same desk where we'd eaten Thai food two weeks ago, where I'd sat and told him about the end-of-year field trip while he'd smiled and nodded and said all the right things.
Her legs wrapped around his waist.
His hips pressed forward.
It was too much. My fingers went dead, and the container slipped from my hands.
It hit the floor with a plastic crack that sounded like a gunshot in the quiet hallway. Eighteen perfect cupcakes exploded across the linoleum, buttercream and vanilla bean and hours of work scattered in a mess of plastic and frosting.
They broke apart.
Liam's head whipped toward the doorway. His face went white. Then red. Then something worse: guilty.
""Piper—""
His voice felt like barbed wire someone had tightened around my heart.
I turned and ran.
My feet hit the stairs too fast, and I grabbed the railing to keep from falling. Behind me, Liam was still calling my name.
""Piper, wait! Please, Piper!""
But I couldn't stop. Wouldn't stop.
The common room blurred past. The bay doors were open and the sunlight was too bright, too normal, too much like the world hadn't just split open. My hands shook so hard I dropped my keys twice trying to unlock my car. The metal bit into my palm when I finally got the door open.
""Piper!""
Liam was in the doorway now, shirt untucked, hair disheveled. Looking exactly like what he was.
I threw myself into the driver's seat, slammed the door and locked it. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely get the key in the ignition.
He reached my car and pressed his palms against the window. ""Please. Please just let me explain!""
The engine turned over.
I looked at him then. Really looked at him. At the man I'd been planning to marry in five weeks. The man I'd woken up at five in the morning to bake for.
His mouth was still red from pecking her.
I put the car in reverse and drove away.
I didn't remember the drive home.
One moment I was pulling out of Station 47's parking lot, and the next I was sitting in my car outside our apartment building, engine still running, hands locked on the steering wheel. The sun was still shining. A woman walked past with a stroller. Somewhere nearby, someone was mowing their lawn.
The world was exactly the same as it had been an hour ago. Except it really wasn't.
My phone buzzed in my purse.
Then again. And again.
I turned off the engine and ignored it.
The stairs to our second-floor apartment felt steeper than usual. My legs were shaking. Or, maybe, I was shaking. I couldn't tell anymore. I got my key in the lock on the third try, pushed the door open, and locked the deadbolt behind me.
The little dining table sat under the window, one chair still pulled out. Liam's jacket hung over the back of it, and I stopped in the doorway, staring. Navy blue fleece, worn at the elbows, smelling like smoke and his cologne. He'd thrown it there this morning before leaving for his shift, too distracted to notice it wasn't where it belonged. I'd walked past it a dozen times, barely noticed it.
Now I couldn't look away.
The wedding binder was on the coffee table. Three inches thick, bursting with magazine clippings and fabric swatches and my handwritten notes in the margins.
Ivory vs. cream? Ask about string lights. Liam's cousin is vegetarian, check menu.
Months and months of planning. A year of being engaged.
And I didn't even know how long he'd been lying.
My purse slipped off my shoulder and hit the floor. I walked past the binder, past his jacket, into the kitchen. As if by instinct, I opened the fridge. Our cake-tasting leftovers were still in there. Neat little slices wrapped in cling film, each labeled in my handwriting. Lemon poppyseed. Chocolate hazelnut. Vanilla bean.
Vanilla bean was the frontrunner, the flavor I'd spent the morning perfecting, as if precision could hold everything together. We were supposed to do a final test with the cupcakes, make the choice official. But he'd been so busy lately that I told myself I was being thoughtful, not desperate, when I brought them to him instead.
The cupcakes were probably still scattered across Station 47's linoleum floor. Perfect swirls of buttercream smashed flat, just like everything else I'd thought was solid.
I closed the fridge.
My hands were shaking again. I needed to do something. Needed to move. Needed to...
I pulled open the pantry and started grabbing things. Butter, flour, sugar, baking powder. I didn't know what I was making. Didn't care. I just needed my hands to be busy, needed the routine, needed something that made sense.
Measure. Pour. Mix.
That made sense.
The butter wasn't soft enough but I creamed it anyway, the wooden spoon scraping against the bowl. My phone buzzed on the counter. It was face down, but I could still see the screen lighting up over and over. I ignored it. Cracked eggs one-handed the way I always did, watched the yolks slide into the bowl.
My vision blurred.
I blinked and kept mixing.
The first batch went into the oven. Muffins, I think, or maybe they were supposed to be cupcakes. I didn't remember adding the baking powder. Didn't remember preheating the oven. But the timer was set and the kitchen smelled like vanilla and butter, and for thirty seconds I could almost pretend everything was fine.
Then I saw the engagement photo on the fridge.
Us at the beach last summer, his arm around my waist, both of us laughing at something his brother had said. I'd been so happy that day. We'd stayed until sunset, and he'd pecked me while the waves crashed behind us and told me he couldn't wait to marry me.
I yanked the photo down and shoved it in the junk drawer.
The timer went off and I pulled the muffins out. They were lopsided, too dark on top. Burnt. I stared at them for a long moment, then dumped the entire pan in the trash.
I leaned against the counter, breathing hard.
Jenna.
I'd met her at the Christmas party. Six months ago. She'd seemed nice, really. Quiet, and a little awkward in the way new people are when they're trying to fit in with an established group. She'd asked me about my classroom, complimented the scarf I was wearing. I'd liked her.
Had it started then? At the party, with me standing right there?
Or later. Maybe January. February. March.
How long?
I didn't even know how long.
I tried to remember March. Parent-teacher conferences. The spring musical rehearsals. I'd stayed late three nights a week helping with costumes. Liam had been working overtime, or so he'd said. Double shifts, budget meetings, a training seminar in Sacramento. It made sense, didn't it? He was on track for Station Captain, buried in overtime and leadership courses and whatever else would make him look indispensable.
God, how many of those late-nights had been lies?
I thought of Jenna.
She was younger than me. Twenty-four, maybe twenty-five. Prettier, probably. I'd barely looked at her today, but I remembered her from the party. Long dark hair, athletic build. She was the kind of girl who made ponytails look intentional and sweat look good. She probably didn't stress-bake at two in the morning. Probably didn't have flour permanently embedded under her fingernails.
She was a firefighter. She did what Liam did, understood his world in a way I never could. When he talked about calls and protocols and the weird hierarchy of station life, she got it. She lived it.
I taught second graders how to share crayons.
My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them flat against the counter.
What did she have that I didn't? What had I done wrong? Was I too boring? Too predictable? Too focused on wedding planning and lesson plans and whether the buttercream ratio was right?
Had he been thinking about her when he pecked me goodbye this morning?
Had he been thinking about her every time?
I shoved away from the counter and grabbed the flour again.
Yes, that's what I needed.
More flour. More sugar. More butter.
This time I measured carefully. Like if I could just get the ratios right, everything else would fall into place too.
By the time the second batch went into the oven, my hands were steadier. I started chocolate chip cookies then, the recipe I'd memorized years ago. Cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs. Stir in the flour and⁠—
Three sharp knocks at the door.
I froze, wooden spoon halfway to the bowl.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was muffled through the door, but I'd know it anywhere. ""Piper, please. I know you're in there.""
The doorknob rattled and, just a few seconds after, his key scraped in the lock.
The door opened an inch and caught on the deadbolt.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was closer now, desperate. ""Please. Just let me in.""
I could see him through the gap. His face was pale, his eyes red-rimmed as if he'd been crying. Or maybe he'd just rubbed his eyes to make it look like he had.
""I need to talk to you,"" he said. ""Please, baby. Just open the door.""
Baby.
He'd called Jenna baby too, probably. Whispered it against her neck while his hands slid under her shirt.
""Piper, please.""
I walked to the door, each step deliberate.
He saw me coming and something like relief flooded his face. ""Thank you. Thank you, I just need five minutes to⁠—""
""How long?"" I asked.
His mouth snapped shut.
""How long, Liam?""
""Can we... can we not do this through the door? Please. Just let me come inside and we can sit down and talk like⁠—""
""How long?""
He closed his eyes. ""Piper⁠—""
""Answer the question or leave.""
There was a long silence. I could hear him breathing. Could hear someone walking down the hallway outside, keys jingling. A door opened and closed somewhere. The building settling around us, as if even it was bracing for what came next.
""Since March,"" he said finally.
March.
The word hung in the air between us, heavy and sharp.
March.
That's when I'd started testing cake flavors. Vanilla bean and lemon and champagne-raspberry. I'd made him try all of them, watched him deliberate like it actually mattered which one we chose. He'd pulled me into his lap and pecked buttercream off my lips and said he didn't care about the cake, he just wanted to marry me.
That was March.
""Say something,"" Liam said. ""Please.""
""We picked out invitations in March.""
""I know⁠—""
""I ordered your wedding band. We had your parents over for dinner. Your mom showed me her dress.""
""Piper—""
""You texted me during parent-teacher conferences."" My voice was steady. ""You sent me a photo of a Sacramento sunset, then said you wished I was there to see it.""
He didn't say anything.
""Was she there?"" I asked. ""When you took that photo?""
Silence.
""Was she there, Liam?""
""Yes."" His voice was barely a whisper.
Something cracked inside my chest. Not my heart... no, that had already broken. It was something else. Something that had been holding me together.
I unlocked the deadbolt.
The door swung open and Liam stumbled forward, catching himself on the doorframe. ""Thank you,"" he breathed. ""Thank you, I just need to explain⁠—""
""Get out.""
He froze. ""What?""
""Get your sh-it,"" I said, ""and get out.""
""Piper, no, just listen to me for one second⁠—""
""I don't want to listen."" My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them against my thighs. ""I don't want to hear about how it was a mistake or how you're sorry or how it didn't mean anything. I want you to pack your things and leave.""
""It didn't mean anything,"" he said anyway. ""I swear to God, Piper, she doesn't... you're the one I love. You're the one I want to marry.""
""You don't get to say that to me."" My voice cracked. ""You don't get to stand here and tell me you love me when you've been fu-cking someone else for months.""
""I wasn't... we... we didn't⁠—""
""Don't."" I held up a hand. ""Don't you dare try to tell me what I saw.""
""Okay."" He ran his hands through his dark blond hair, the same gesture he always made when he was stressed. ""Okay. You're right. I'm not going to lie to you anymore. But Piper, please, I made a mistake. A huge, terrible mistake, but we can fix this. We can go to counseling, we can⁠—""
""Get. Out.""
""This is my home too."" His voice shifted. Harder now. ""I'm on the lease, Piper. You can't just kick me out.""
I stared at him.
He was pulling the lease card. Actually standing here, reeking of guilt and another woman's perfume, and pulling the lease card.
""You want to stay here?"" I asked.
""I want us to work this out.""
""You want to stay in this apartment?""
""That's not what I⁠—""
""Fine,"" I said.
""Fine what?""
I turned and walked toward the bedroom. ""Keep it.""
""Piper, what are you⁠—""
I grabbed my duffel bag from the closet and started throwing things into it. Underwear. Bras. T-shirts. My hands were shaking so badly I kept dropping things.
""What are you doing?"" Liam appeared in the doorway. ""Piper, stop.""
I shoved past him to the dresser. Grabbed jeans, leggings, a sweater. I didn't even bother folding any of it, just stuffed it all into the bag.
""You can't just leave,"" he said. ""We need to talk about this.""
""Move.""
""No."" He planted himself in front of the closet. ""Not until you calm down and listen to me.""
""Calm down?"" I looked at him, the man I'd been planning to spend my life with. ""You want me to calm down.""
""This isn't... God, Piper, you're not thinking clearly.""
""I'm thinking very clearly."" I zipped the duffel bag. ""You cheated on me. While I planned our wedding. While I baked you cakes and folded your laundry and told my second-graders about how I was getting married to the best man in the world.""
His face crumpled. ""Piper⁠—""
""You want the apartment?"" I slung the bag over my shoulder. ""It's yours. Enjoy it.""
""Where are you going?""
""Anywhere that isn't here.""
""This is insane,"" he said. ""You're being insane.""
I pushed past him. He grabbed my arm and I jerked away so hard I stumbled.
""Don't touch me.""
""Piper, please⁠—""
I walked to the kitchen, grabbed my purse and my phone and my laptop. The duffel bag was cutting into my shoulder but I didn't care. I just needed to get out and breathe air that didn't smell like him.
Liam followed me to the door. ""You can't just walk away from this. From us. What about the wedding?""
I stopped and turned around.
""What about it?"" I asked.
""We have two hundred people coming. We have deposits. We have⁠—""
""Cancel it.""
""Piper—""
""Or don't. I don't care. Marry Jenna if you want. I'm done.""

2. the quantity of people, mapaonline food app or in person is sooooo many yet isa or dalawa lang kayo sa store? dagdag mo pa mga galit na ibabato sayo, which is understandable on the other end, pero even if you would like to provide a fast and effective service, di mo na gaano magawa dahil...

3. hindi ka na makakain. 30 mins break? jusko, wala yan kung maraming tao. hindi na makakain, sobrang stressed, at naliliyo na sa kakapaikot ikot.

4. idk if ganito sa lahat ng stores, pero in  our store grabe araw araw gusto kami ipagstraight? like 8am-10pm??? aba, hindi naman yata robot ang employees para ganunin. though bayad naman ang OT, still pano naman yung employees na walang pake sa OT at gusto lang magpahinga after 8 hrs? walang choice ganun? ewan ko ba. they keep on opening branches yet they are always understaffed on most case scenarios, tapos the existent employees are the one who suffer.

5. medyo may attitude ang supervisor. ewan ko lang ha, pero yung samin passive aggressive mag guide at halata mong iba ang treatment sa older baristas. kakainis pa yung ugaling  tsaka lang iimik pag nagkamali ka na sa gawain so asan ang ""guidance"" don?, ewan ko rin.

The silence stretched for a heartbeat. It wasn't the comfortable quiet of people working side-by-side, but... something else. Something that made my chest tighten.
There was a rustle of fabric. A sharp intake of breath.
My feet moved before my brain caught up. I moved up the steps, then into the hallway. The door to his cramped office was half-open, and I could see...
I could see...
Liam's hand was in Jenna's hair. His other hand, the one that had held mine just this morning, the one that would slip a ring on my finger in five weeks, was cupped against her jaw, tilting her face up to his. Her hands were fisted in his shirt, the navy station t-shirt I'd folded fresh from the dryer last Sunday. They were pressed together against his desk, and he was pecking her the way he used to peck me. The way he hadn't pecked me in...
God, how long?
How long had it been since he'd pecked me like that? Like he was desperate for it? Like he couldn't breathe without it?
Jenna made a soft, breathy sound, and Liam's fingers tightened in her hair. Something inside my chest cracked open.
His mouth moved to her neck. Her head tilted back, exposing her throat, and his free hand dropped to her waist, sliding under the hem of her shirt. She arched into him, and he lifted her—actually lifted her—onto the edge of his desk. The same desk where we'd eaten Thai food two weeks ago, where I'd sat and told him about the end-of-year field trip while he'd smiled and nodded and said all the right things.
Her legs wrapped around his waist.
His hips pressed forward.
It was too much. My fingers went dead, and the container slipped from my hands.
It hit the floor with a plastic crack that sounded like a gunshot in the quiet hallway. Eighteen perfect cupcakes exploded across the linoleum, buttercream and vanilla bean and hours of work scattered in a mess of plastic and frosting.
They broke apart.
Liam's head whipped toward the doorway. His face went white. Then red. Then something worse: guilty.
""Piper—""
His voice felt like barbed wire someone had tightened around my heart.
I turned and ran.
My feet hit the stairs too fast, and I grabbed the railing to keep from falling. Behind me, Liam was still calling my name.
""Piper, wait! Please, Piper!""
But I couldn't stop. Wouldn't stop.
The common room blurred past. The bay doors were open and the sunlight was too bright, too normal, too much like the world hadn't just split open. My hands shook so hard I dropped my keys twice trying to unlock my car. The metal bit into my palm when I finally got the door open.
""Piper!""
Liam was in the doorway now, shirt untucked, hair disheveled. Looking exactly like what he was.
I threw myself into the driver's seat, slammed the door and locked it. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely get the key in the ignition.
He reached my car and pressed his palms against the window. ""Please. Please just let me explain!""
The engine turned over.
I looked at him then. Really looked at him. At the man I'd been planning to marry in five weeks. The man I'd woken up at five in the morning to bake for.
His mouth was still red from pecking her.
I put the car in reverse and drove away.
I didn't remember the drive home.
One moment I was pulling out of Station 47's parking lot, and the next I was sitting in my car outside our apartment building, engine still running, hands locked on the steering wheel. The sun was still shining. A woman walked past with a stroller. Somewhere nearby, someone was mowing their lawn.
The world was exactly the same as it had been an hour ago. Except it really wasn't.
My phone buzzed in my purse.
Then again. And again.
I turned off the engine and ignored it.
The stairs to our second-floor apartment felt steeper than usual. My legs were shaking. Or, maybe, I was shaking. I couldn't tell anymore. I got my key in the lock on the third try, pushed the door open, and locked the deadbolt behind me.
The little dining table sat under the window, one chair still pulled out. Liam's jacket hung over the back of it, and I stopped in the doorway, staring. Navy blue fleece, worn at the elbows, smelling like smoke and his cologne. He'd thrown it there this morning before leaving for his shift, too distracted to notice it wasn't where it belonged. I'd walked past it a dozen times, barely noticed it.
Now I couldn't look away.
The wedding binder was on the coffee table. Three inches thick, bursting with magazine clippings and fabric swatches and my handwritten notes in the margins.
Ivory vs. cream? Ask about string lights. Liam's cousin is vegetarian, check menu.
Months and months of planning. A year of being engaged.
And I didn't even know how long he'd been lying.
My purse slipped off my shoulder and hit the floor. I walked past the binder, past his jacket, into the kitchen. As if by instinct, I opened the fridge. Our cake-tasting leftovers were still in there. Neat little slices wrapped in cling film, each labeled in my handwriting. Lemon poppyseed. Chocolate hazelnut. Vanilla bean.
Vanilla bean was the frontrunner, the flavor I'd spent the morning perfecting, as if precision could hold everything together. We were supposed to do a final test with the cupcakes, make the choice official. But he'd been so busy lately that I told myself I was being thoughtful, not desperate, when I brought them to him instead.
The cupcakes were probably still scattered across Station 47's linoleum floor. Perfect swirls of buttercream smashed flat, just like everything else I'd thought was solid.
I closed the fridge.
My hands were shaking again. I needed to do something. Needed to move. Needed to...
I pulled open the pantry and started grabbing things. Butter, flour, sugar, baking powder. I didn't know what I was making. Didn't care. I just needed my hands to be busy, needed the routine, needed something that made sense.
Measure. Pour. Mix.
That made sense.
The butter wasn't soft enough but I creamed it anyway, the wooden spoon scraping against the bowl. My phone buzzed on the counter. It was face down, but I could still see the screen lighting up over and over. I ignored it. Cracked eggs one-handed the way I always did, watched the yolks slide into the bowl.
My vision blurred.
I blinked and kept mixing.
The first batch went into the oven. Muffins, I think, or maybe they were supposed to be cupcakes. I didn't remember adding the baking powder. Didn't remember preheating the oven. But the timer was set and the kitchen smelled like vanilla and butter, and for thirty seconds I could almost pretend everything was fine.
Then I saw the engagement photo on the fridge.
Us at the beach last summer, his arm around my waist, both of us laughing at something his brother had said. I'd been so happy that day. We'd stayed until sunset, and he'd pecked me while the waves crashed behind us and told me he couldn't wait to marry me.
I yanked the photo down and shoved it in the junk drawer.
The timer went off and I pulled the muffins out. They were lopsided, too dark on top. Burnt. I stared at them for a long moment, then dumped the entire pan in the trash.
I leaned against the counter, breathing hard.
Jenna.
I'd met her at the Christmas party. Six months ago. She'd seemed nice, really. Quiet, and a little awkward in the way new people are when they're trying to fit in with an established group. She'd asked me about my classroom, complimented the scarf I was wearing. I'd liked her.
Had it started then? At the party, with me standing right there?
Or later. Maybe January. February. March.
How long?
I didn't even know how long.
I tried to remember March. Parent-teacher conferences. The spring musical rehearsals. I'd stayed late three nights a week helping with costumes. Liam had been working overtime, or so he'd said. Double shifts, budget meetings, a training seminar in Sacramento. It made sense, didn't it? He was on track for Station Captain, buried in overtime and leadership courses and whatever else would make him look indispensable.
God, how many of those late-nights had been lies?
I thought of Jenna.
She was younger than me. Twenty-four, maybe twenty-five. Prettier, probably. I'd barely looked at her today, but I remembered her from the party. Long dark hair, athletic build. She was the kind of girl who made ponytails look intentional and sweat look good. She probably didn't stress-bake at two in the morning. Probably didn't have flour permanently embedded under her fingernails.
She was a firefighter. She did what Liam did, understood his world in a way I never could. When he talked about calls and protocols and the weird hierarchy of station life, she got it. She lived it.
I taught second graders how to share crayons.
My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them flat against the counter.
What did she have that I didn't? What had I done wrong? Was I too boring? Too predictable? Too focused on wedding planning and lesson plans and whether the buttercream ratio was right?
Had he been thinking about her when he pecked me goodbye this morning?
Had he been thinking about her every time?
I shoved away from the counter and grabbed the flour again.
Yes, that's what I needed.
More flour. More sugar. More butter.
This time I measured carefully. Like if I could just get the ratios right, everything else would fall into place too.
By the time the second batch went into the oven, my hands were steadier. I started chocolate chip cookies then, the recipe I'd memorized years ago. Cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs. Stir in the flour and⁠—
Three sharp knocks at the door.
I froze, wooden spoon halfway to the bowl.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was muffled through the door, but I'd know it anywhere. ""Piper, please. I know you're in there.""
The doorknob rattled and, just a few seconds after, his key scraped in the lock.
The door opened an inch and caught on the deadbolt.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was closer now, desperate. ""Please. Just let me in.""
I could see him through the gap. His face was pale, his eyes red-rimmed as if he'd been crying. Or maybe he'd just rubbed his eyes to make it look like he had.
""I need to talk to you,"" he said. ""Please, baby. Just open the door.""
Baby.
He'd called Jenna baby too, probably. Whispered it against her neck while his hands slid under her shirt.
""Piper, please.""
I walked to the door, each step deliberate.
He saw me coming and something like relief flooded his face. ""Thank you. Thank you, I just need five minutes to⁠—""
""How long?"" I asked.
His mouth snapped shut.
""How long, Liam?""
""Can we... can we not do this through the door? Please. Just let me come inside and we can sit down and talk like⁠—""
""How long?""
He closed his eyes. ""Piper⁠—""
""Answer the question or leave.""
There was a long silence. I could hear him breathing. Could hear someone walking down the hallway outside, keys jingling. A door opened and closed somewhere. The building settling around us, as if even it was bracing for what came next.
""Since March,"" he said finally.
March.
The word hung in the air between us, heavy and sharp.
March.
That's when I'd started testing cake flavors. Vanilla bean and lemon and champagne-raspberry. I'd made him try all of them, watched him deliberate like it actually mattered which one we chose. He'd pulled me into his lap and pecked buttercream off my lips and said he didn't care about the cake, he just wanted to marry me.
That was March.
""Say something,"" Liam said. ""Please.""
""We picked out invitations in March.""
""I know⁠—""
""I ordered your wedding band. We had your parents over for dinner. Your mom showed me her dress.""
""Piper—""
""You texted me during parent-teacher conferences."" My voice was steady. ""You sent me a photo of a Sacramento sunset, then said you wished I was there to see it.""
He didn't say anything.
""Was she there?"" I asked. ""When you took that photo?""
Silence.
""Was she there, Liam?""
""Yes."" His voice was barely a whisper.
Something cracked inside my chest. Not my heart... no, that had already broken. It was something else. Something that had been holding me together.
I unlocked the deadbolt.
The door swung open and Liam stumbled forward, catching himself on the doorframe. ""Thank you,"" he breathed. ""Thank you, I just need to explain⁠—""
""Get out.""
He froze. ""What?""
""Get your sh-it,"" I said, ""and get out.""
""Piper, no, just listen to me for one second⁠—""
""I don't want to listen."" My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them against my thighs. ""I don't want to hear about how it was a mistake or how you're sorry or how it didn't mean anything. I want you to pack your things and leave.""
""It didn't mean anything,"" he said anyway. ""I swear to God, Piper, she doesn't... you're the one I love. You're the one I want to marry.""
""You don't get to say that to me."" My voice cracked. ""You don't get to stand here and tell me you love me when you've been fu-cking someone else for months.""
""I wasn't... we... we didn't⁠—""
""Don't."" I held up a hand. ""Don't you dare try to tell me what I saw.""
""Okay."" He ran his hands through his dark blond hair, the same gesture he always made when he was stressed. ""Okay. You're right. I'm not going to lie to you anymore. But Piper, please, I made a mistake. A huge, terrible mistake, but we can fix this. We can go to counseling, we can⁠—""
""Get. Out.""
""This is my home too."" His voice shifted. Harder now. ""I'm on the lease, Piper. You can't just kick me out.""
I stared at him.
He was pulling the lease card. Actually standing here, reeking of guilt and another woman's perfume, and pulling the lease card.
""You want to stay here?"" I asked.
""I want us to work this out.""
""You want to stay in this apartment?""
""That's not what I⁠—""
""Fine,"" I said.
""Fine what?""
I turned and walked toward the bedroom. ""Keep it.""
""Piper, what are you⁠—""
I grabbed my duffel bag from the closet and started throwing things into it. Underwear. Bras. T-shirts. My hands were shaking so badly I kept dropping things.
""What are you doing?"" Liam appeared in the doorway. ""Piper, stop.""
I shoved past him to the dresser. Grabbed jeans, leggings, a sweater. I didn't even bother folding any of it, just stuffed it all into the bag.
""You can't just leave,"" he said. ""We need to talk about this.""
""Move.""
""No."" He planted himself in front of the closet. ""Not until you calm down and listen to me.""
""Calm down?"" I looked at him, the man I'd been planning to spend my life with. ""You want me to calm down.""
""This isn't... God, Piper, you're not thinking clearly.""
""I'm thinking very clearly."" I zipped the duffel bag. ""You cheated on me. While I planned our wedding. While I baked you cakes and folded your laundry and told my second-graders about how I was getting married to the best man in the world.""
His face crumpled. ""Piper⁠—""
""You want the apartment?"" I slung the bag over my shoulder. ""It's yours. Enjoy it.""
""Where are you going?""
""Anywhere that isn't here.""
""This is insane,"" he said. ""You're being insane.""
I pushed past him. He grabbed my arm and I jerked away so hard I stumbled.
""Don't touch me.""
""Piper, please⁠—""
I walked to the kitchen, grabbed my purse and my phone and my laptop. The duffel bag was cutting into my shoulder but I didn't care. I just needed to get out and breathe air that didn't smell like him.
Liam followed me to the door. ""You can't just walk away from this. From us. What about the wedding?""
I stopped and turned around.
""What about it?"" I asked.
""We have two hundred people coming. We have deposits. We have⁠—""
""Cancel it.""
""Piper—""
""Or don't. I don't care. Marry Jenna if you want. I'm done.""

He's a really nice guy and I do think he's handsome but would never try anything since he's married with kids and obviously straight lol. 

What I am unsure about is I think he knows I'm gay and have a crush on him.

When he got to work while getting coffee he said ""so I'm the love of your life?"" While smiling. I said nope work is my new love. After that as we were the only two working due to government shutdown one day he was getting lunch I said I was good and while walking away said I'm just going to grab you something babe. Then got quiet said I'm just getting you something. As time has gone one we have gotten along well. We converse all the time even when me or him are showering in the morning after working out. He I think joked the other day when I was talking about a song I was listening to walking in the bathroom to shower, Linda rondstat long long time, I said that song I was listening to I hadn't listened to the words and it's sad. His response was the one you were playing for me.  We just laughed at how I thought it was a nice song when I was little and now know it's sad.  

My co worker thinks he knows too as he asks her about the person who broke my heart but she doesn't say anything.

1ot50l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ot50l5/my_alcoholic_family_tree_has_many_branches/,My alcoholic family tree has many branches,"365 days ago, I looked at my reflection – red rimmed glassy eyes, greasy hair and a puffy face, mouth salivating from throwing up white wine and the coffee I drank to convince myself I wasn’t as hungover as I really was. Hands gripping the sink as I chanted what had become the sentence I repeated over and over – “this has to stop.” When did I become a drunk?

I called in sick to work that day, and wasted away in bed while I wrestled with what I knew I wanted and what I feared the most – I had to stop. So I did, cold turkey, and one week melted into two weeks which both agonizingly slow and ridiculously fast became three months. I celebrated a sober Christmas and New Year, I deflated and could zip my winter coat and tie my shoes with gasping, slept so soundly I felt like I was in a coma and energy poured out of me like a 5’2 version of the energize bunny. 

I realized my alcoholic family tree has many branches and I whacked into each of them as I fell down the tree before collapsing in a heap of my very own rock bottom.

And slowly, I began to heal. And not just white knuckle heal this time, I put in the God damn work. I cried, yelled, read and breathed sobriety. I called myself a drunk and then proclaimed myself a warrior for trying to change.

Then suddenly, I was 8 months sober and it wasn’t so hard any more and instead of people asking me how long I was planning on going without drinking, they began to tell me they were proud of me. I became proud of me too, which was an entirely new feeling.

I racked up more sober wins – a birthday celebrated by painting pottery instead of drinking for the first time in years, a trip to Vegas where I tried caviar for the first time rather than $30 cocktails, and early mornings with my tiny dog who I don’t have to apologize to anymore for drunkenly crashing into the couch or not walking her because of the hangovers.

 

And now? Now it’s been a year. A whole year of no alcohol which is something I couldn’t fathom when I gripped the sink all those days ago, days that my sobriety counter has lovingly kept track of for me. 356 days of being clear and strong, of hoping one day I get to drive through a check stop or have someone ask me for a ride at 2am, of spending money on things that make me feel pretty rather than look like shit.

365 morning coffees and beautiful moments, of hugging my parents and admiring the sky. Days with no headaches, or back aches or heartaches over what I had done the night before, and instead evenings of finding myself and realizing that one day I’d be happy again and that it wouldn’t be alcohol that made it so, but rather my own self.

 

I’m almost looking forward to day 366 just as much as today, because to me it’s an even more important date. Because this isn’t over yet, I fear, and there is still work to be done. So with that I say, IWNDWYT. <3",6,1762750638.0,stopdrinking,1,0.88,False
1ot50j6,https://i.redd.it/c2av3wdn2d0g1.jpeg,New to using Libby (and kind of to using libraries too),"Hi, I'm hoping I can get some help and tips on navigating the app and library space in general since i havent been to one since i was a kid, and lets face it, child me didnt understand much about processes and just read whatever book was in front of me with a fun cover. 

A little backstory: Lately i have had time and opportunity to actually fully engage in my hobbies (healthy relationships/environments that enable me in positive ways yay), and i have started to get back into reading again. I have been buying books i know i will definitely read multiple times, but i want to actually use my local library and discover more books than the ones im sure about. I also  started spending the first half hour of my mornings with a coffee and a book, but then i ran out of books. 

I joined my local library and got the Libby app but i havent been able to find a single book that i have on my journal page of ""want to read"" recs. Admittedly, most of these books are philosophy related because I've also recently discovered that and am in love with all the ideas. I especially love reading books that engage you in a discussion with the characters, author, or book itself. 

My issue is, none of the books i search have any copies, and using the ""available now"" tag in advanced search options doesnt seem to narrow down my search to omit these books that my library doesnt have. I would just pop in to the library but im super nervous on how to navigate that appropriately and what the social expectation is there, or what is normal to ask for etc (i am a neurodivergent person)... so i havent been able to get myself to pop in yet, but i'm building myself up to it. 

My questions:

● Is there a better way to search in Libby?
● Does 0 copies mean it doesnt exist *at all* in my library or just that there is only 1 of that book with no *other* copies?
● Any tips for finding books I would be interested in reading either on Libby or at the actual library?
● Any tips on navigating the library space?
● Lastly, any recommendations on where to find the books on my list if my library doesnt have them? I am a uni student and have tried my uni library but got very confused. I also think some of the books on my list actually arent there either. 

Thank you in advance. I also added a screenshot of my want to read list so far from Libby for a snapshot of the kind of books I have been looking for (all show 0 copies available). Location is also in QLD Australia if that helps too.

The betting market has the Orlando Magic as a clear favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.74** (implied probability: \~57%) versus the Trail Blazers’ **2.14** (\~47%). The spread? Orlando -2.5, which is about as shocking as seeing a penguin in a swimsuit. The total is set at **235.5 points**, suggesting this could be another high-octane shootout—think of it as a fireworks show where both teams forget who’s supposed to win.

Portland’s recent performance is as reliable as a Wi-Fi connection in a subway tunnel. After losing to the Miami Heat 131-136 in a game that had more lead changes (19!) than a Netflix password, the Blazers’ bench was outscored 63-33. Their starting five tried to carry the load, but even Deni Avdija’s triple-double (33 points, 11 rebounds, 8 assists) couldn’t offset Shaedon Sharpe’s nine turnovers—though we’re 90% sure at least two of those were intentional attempts to trip up Miami’s defense.

Meanwhile, the Blazers’ other centers—Klingsberg, Ries, and Robert Williams—have stepped in like a well-rehearsed relay team. Klingsberg, for instance, dropped 13 points and 6 rebounds in 21 minutes against Miami, proving that sometimes, the third-stringer just needs a chance to shine (or at least a better

\-----





**In the quiet hills of Aleppo Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania, a young boy’s childhood was marked by nights of chilling howls echoing through the woods, and one terrifying confrontation that changed his family forever. More than seventy years later, John, now an elderly veteran, recounts the haunting events surrounding his grandfather’s final stand against what he called** ***the Dark Walker*****. Was it an unknown creature, a spiritual harbinger, or something far stranger?**



“When I was a boy, my mother and I lived with my grandfather, who owned a farmhouse in a rural area of southwestern Pennsylvania. My grandfather was a handyman who also worked in a small blacksmith shop in his old barn. My grandmother had died before I was born, and my father had also passed away while serving overseas in the U.S. Army.



Beginning in the summer of 1946, we started hearing strange howling sounds coming from the woods surrounding the property. The activity came at night and was very frightening when the howling came close. The sounds didn’t seem to bother my grandfather, though my mother and I were shaken whenever it began. The noises continued intermittently for about a year, but we never saw any animals. My grandfather and I hunted deer and squirrels in the woods during the colder months, but we never noticed signs of unusual wildlife activity.



One late afternoon in the spring of 1947, I was helping my grandfather in his shop when I noticed something moving at the edge of the woods, near an area where my grandfather kept a few junk cars and scrap. It was about 200 feet away, but I could clearly see something, or someone, moving around. I told my grandfather to look. He walked to the door, lit his pipe, and said nothing. After a minute or two, he turned around and got back to work. About that time, the thing moved into the woods and disappeared.



I couldn’t tell how big it was, but it reminded me of a magazine picture I’d seen of a large ape said to live in the jungles of Asia. Later that evening, I told my mother what I had seen. She was shocked because she knew I wouldn’t lie to her, and the howling had been getting closer. I also told her how my grandfather reacted when I pointed it out. She immediately went to him in the sitting room and demanded to know what it was. He shook his head slowly and said he’d hoped we wouldn’t ‘see it,’ because he was afraid we’d be scared and leave him.



After assuring him we would never leave, my mother pressed again. He looked away, took a deep breath, and said, ‘It’s a Dark Walker.’ He told us it had lived in the woods for many years. He said the native Indians called it *Stone Spirit,* an evil being that appeared when someone was about to die. The last time he had seen it was the night before my grandmother passed away. My mother was skeptical about the ‘harbinger of death’ part, but she sensed something unnatural was nearby.



The howling continued each night, though we hadn’t seen the Dark Walker again. One warm evening, as we sat on the back porch listening to the radio, we heard a few distant howls. Then, suddenly, my grandfather stood up and looked toward the barn.

He turned to me and said, ‘John, get my pistol and ammo. Hurry now.’



I ran into the sitting room and grabbed his .455 Webley revolver and a handful of bullets from an old steamer trunk. I handed it to him and watched him load the gun. He then picked up a hatchet and slid it into his belt. ‘Now, both of you get into the house. Now!’



My mother and I watched from the kitchen door as my grandfather ambled toward the barn. We saw him turn the corner and disappear into the dark. A few moments later, we heard three gunshots, and then a blood-curdling scream echoed from the woods near the barn. Then silence.



We froze, unsure what to do, until we heard him shout, ‘Stay in the house until I come back!’



Soon after, we heard his pickup truck start. I looked out and saw him drive behind the barn. A few minutes later, he backed up and pulled onto the road. There was something significant in the truck bed, covered by a tarp. My mother told me to go to bed.



The next morning, I came downstairs and sat beside my grandfather. He was drinking coffee and reading the paper. My mother sat across from him, staring. After a while, she said, ‘Well, Dad, tell him.’



My grandfather put the paper down, looked at me, and said simply, ‘I killed the Dark Walker.’



My mother told me never to speak of it again. We didn’t.



My grandfather lived another fifteen years. My mother stayed with him until his dying day. When I grew older, I moved away and raised a family. Each summer, I’d visit, and never again heard the howls.” *John, retired Federal employee, Nevada (originally Aleppo Township, Greene County, PA)*



**Patterns & Behavior:**

This account falls within a subset of *hominid or entity* reports where cryptid-like beings are associated with death omens or supernatural portents. The “Dark Walker” motif, appearing before a death, echoes the European “Black Dog” or *Grim* folklore and the Native American *Stone Spirit* or *Death Watcher* archetype.

**Witness Tone & Credibility:**

John’s tone is steady, nostalgic, and unembellished. At 81, his retelling carries the weight of authenticity and emotional restraint. His depiction of his grandfather as pragmatic yet spiritually wary lends the story a sense of lived realism rather than fantasy.

**Possible Correlations:**

* Similar Appalachian and Shawnee legends describe shadowy forest guardians or spirits that manifest before tragedy.
* Greene County, Pennsylvania, has had sporadic reports of Bigfoot-type sightings, lending potential overlap with cryptids.
* The creature’s lower gait and apparent animalistic movement suggest a hybrid morphology, rather than a purely humanoid one.

**Theories on Origin:**

* **Cryptid Hypothesis:** A regional, possibly subterranean or forest-adapted species exhibiting nocturnal patterns and territorial behavior.
* **Interdimensional / Ultraterrestrial Hypothesis:** The “harbinger” link suggests an entity capable of phasing between realities, appearing under specific emotional or energetic conditions.
* **Psychospiritual Manifestation:** The Dark Walker may represent a materialized energy form triggered by impending death or trauma, neither a ghost nor a beast, but something in between.



**Summary:**

**Whether corporeal or metaphysical, the Dark Walker of Aleppo Township remains one of the earliest documented cases tying Appalachian hominid phenomena to death-portent folklore. The convergence of fear, protection, and generational silence leaves the mystery unsolved, but unforgettable. Lon**

FAITH 

*“She stole my life.""*



That’s the short version.  
Doctors prefer long ones — case notes, acronyms, pie charts of repentance.  
I give you the director’s cut.

My room is beige from floor to theology — beige walls, beige coffee, beige optimism.  
Even the light has learned to whisper.  
Every bulb here hums like it’s afraid to wake the truth.

At 7:03 sharp, the pill cart begins its pilgrimage —  
metal wheels ticking down the hall like a clock that forgot how to tick.  
Nurses murmur dosages as if they were psalms.  
Someone laughs too softly.  
It always sounds rehearsed.

On my desk: twenty years of notebooks, spines mummified in tape, titles erased by time.  
Each one a fossil of a thought — carbon-dated in regret.  
They called it write therapy. I called it archeology with a pen.

We were both right, depending on who signed the chart.

I remember the years after the riverbank.  
What I don’t remember are the seventeen before — the years that built the person I forgot how to be.

They said there’d been an accident — a boy dead in the water, two girls, one found, one lost.

I was the found one.  
They called it a miracle. I called it a clerical error.  
The only thing they found on me was a small marble — green, ordinary, indecently calm.  
It means nothing to me.

They keep handing it back during therapy, as if memory could be triggered like a smoke alarm.  
I stare at it. Nope. Not working.

But I remember the smell more than the faces — a sharp, metallic wind coming off the river, as if the earth itself had rusted overnight. It clung to my hair for weeks, that faint taste of iron in the rain. I thought it was just the water. No one corrected me.

So I write.  
Every day. Longhand. No typewriter — too sharp an object.  
Apparently a well-placed comma can kill a man.

My notebooks speak in tongues: numbers, nuns, bruises, disinfectant.  
They call it imagination. I call it evidence waiting for a jury.

Then one morning the nurse waltzes in, gossiping over the pill cart.  
“Oh Faith, have you heard? That writer — Charity Hart — they’re making a movie now!”

That name.  
It cracked something. Not loud, just clean — like a bone giving up — and It slapped me like a wet piece of slate — but in a bad way. 

Inelegant, but effective. 

And then it happened  — twenty years of silence collapsing like rotten scaffolding.

The memories didn’t just return — they assaulted me.

Twenty years of amnesia, ambushed by a name.

By evening the memories came rushing back, uninvited and perfectly timed. My lost years. *All of them*. 

I asked for her book—the one everyone was talking about. Patients get one library request a month if they promise not to underline things. 

Ok, I promise.

It arrived one week later, plastic-wrapped, like evidence*.*  *Evidence — I’d say.*

I opened it. Started reading.

By page one I’d stopped breathing. By page three I was furious — no, worse —recognized.

It was me. My childhood, my adolescence, my bruises rearranged into literature.  
The orphanage, the ledgers, the numbers, the scars, the nuns. My lost seventeen years —  in Charity Hart’s book.  

She stole my life.

I tried to tell them. The nurses, the doctors, the ones with kind eyes and clipboards. They nodded the way people nod when they’re waiting for you to finish so they can call security. 

The nurses smiled like lifeguards watching a slow drown. The doctor nodded, wrote *paranoid ideation*, and offered decaf.

The more I screamed, the softer their voices got. 

The more I insisted, the heavier the pills. 

My paper cup rattled like applause for my own diagnosis.

“Faith,” they said, “you’re confusing fiction and reality again.”  
I said, “Reality’s the confusing part.”  
They wrote that down. They always do.

That’s when I understood: the truth doesn’t set you free — it gets you sedated. 

A lot. 

And silence tastes like mercy when it’s laced with enough milligrams.

So I stopped talking about Charity Hart. 

I had to. 

I stopped insisting. I learned the choreography of sanity: eye contact, agreement — the occasional smile. 

When they said we think you’re improving, I said oh yeah, I think so too.

They reduced my medication. They wrote *lucid.* I wrote *finally.*

That’s how you graduate: you pretend your clarity is a delusion that’s learned its manners.  
They shook my hand and wrote *Recovered***.**  

Then rolled me out to the world.

Now I’m free—technically. But freedom is conditional. I can walk in daylight, but I can’t tell the truth. Because if I tell them what really happened — they’ll send me back and adjust the dosage.

lmk what you think and if you have any others to add!!

1. write the goal in pen, and the execution in pencil / chase broader principles and values before outcomes. this doesn’t require a 5 year plan or make you boring because you only define yourself by your achievements.
2. instead of forcing yourself to do something, ask yourself, ‘how can i make myself enjoy this 1% more?’ it becomes a weirdly fun challenge, like when i’m doing the dishes. discipline < enjoying the process.
3. rule of 100: don’t quit something until you’ve done it 100 times, improving something incrementally each rep. the incentive to continue is to form a nuanced opinion and retain an open mind. it’s just “research”…
4. set non-negotiable deadlines but flexible execution: i do things in random order, spontaneously switch between tasks, take a lap around the block, buy a coffee, etc. but by tonight, everything will be done, guaranteed.
5. pick up an activity that gives you that dopamine hit but punishes impulsivity. chess punishes blunders and impulsive captures. distance running punishes keeping a speed you can’t maintain.
6. justify commitment occasionally, because a lot of the time, it actually gives you more options. e.g., a job with transferrable skills, managing personal finances effectively, fitness, a partner that actually makes you grow, etc.

1ot4rrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/StratteraRx/comments/1ot4rrr/adjustments_or_long_term_symptoms/,Adjustments or Long Term Symptoms?,"Hey all

I started atomoxetine about 8 weeks ago. I started off on a low 20mg a night and just a couple days ago got upped to 40mg. I’ve been experiencing some symptoms I’m kind of curious about. When I brought them up to my doctor we both agreed it was likely me not being used to having my symptoms be managed (this is my first time trying any kind of medication to help with my adhd or mental health and I’m almost 27F)/ probably needing a bit more since we started off at such a low dose. 
I know it’s only been five days since we upped but the symptoms are worsening and I’m wondering if they’re common and I’m just adjusting or it’s something else?

Prior to starting I would have a ton of motivation and had so many things I wanted to do for the day but would just get stuck. Even setting a small goal like watching a new episode of a show couldn’t be accomplished no matter how much I wanted to. I also was having a lot of issues feeding myself. If something didn’t sound good I couldn’t eat it. When my partner would try and suggest things to eat it made it worse. If I knew what I wanted and he suggested it I immediately sounded unappetizing. It felt similar to demand avoidance in a way. These two symptoms of my adhd were why we tried Atomoxetine. 

Now I not only have no motivation but I don’t even want to do anything at all. The urge to do things I previously enjoyed is just gone. I refused going to some of my favorite places without a second thought and not even thinking about it. Doing things anyway because I know I typically would enjoy them feels like nothing. I’m just going through the motions. 

While I have enjoyed not having a million active trains of thought I’m also struggling with the opposite. It’s quiet. And not in a relaxing way. 
I will get up and do something and then minutes later realize I did and it give a sense of blacking out. Or I’ll do things and feel like I’m not in control of it. Almost like I’m stuck going through the motions and can’t stop myself. It’s nothing dangerous, just daily tasks like drinking my coffee or giving me pets their food. 

I also have been staring. A lot of empty staring. I’m not thinking or listening to anything. I’m just gone. It’s very apathetic. Im not sure if this matters but I’m particularly staring at lights or bright spaces. Like lit up corners, reflections in windows or cars, walls that the sunlight hits, etc. 

Those are the most concerning symptoms since I haven’t really seen or heard much of it, especially the staring. Regular symptoms like loss of appetite I am also experiencing and have gone a full 24 hours without eating and not really feeling any affect from it. That one we are aware of and trying to combat actively by setting alarms and having easy sources on hand. 

My dr and I agreed to give it  another couple weeks and reevaluate but I guess I’m just curious if anyone has experienced this and if it went away or stuck around?

Edit to add:
I also am extremely uncaring about anything anymore. I don’t care about things I was meticulous about and in some situations things that break that I cherished I don’t care. 

It’s also important to add that I don’t feel like this when I am at work. The only symptom that follows me to work is loss of appetite. I never had adhd problem at work either even before medication. I only ever experienced them while I was in school and now in my personal life outside of work. ",2,1762749845.0,StratteraRx,1,1.0,False

## The Iconic Cities You Can't Miss (The Classics)

Let's get these out of the way. You simply can't visit Tuscany without paying homage to its heavyweight champions. But we'll focus on *how* to experience them.

### **Florence (Firenze)**
The cradle of the Renaissance. It's crowded, yes, but for a reason. Instead of just ticking boxes, immerse yourself.
*   **Climb the Duomo:** Pre-book your ticket to climb Brunelleschi's magnificent dome. The 360-degree view of the red-tiled roofs is a core memory in the making.
*   **Uffizi & Accademia (Smartly):** Don't just wander in. Book timed-entry tickets months in advance. For the Uffizi, focus on key halls (Botticelli's *Birth of Venus*) to avoid burnout. For the Accademia, your goal is Michelangelo's *David*—go straight to it and marvel.
*   **Get Lost in the Oltrarno:** Cross the Ponte Vecchio into the Oltrarno district. It's less touristy, full of artisan workshops, and home to the stunning Pitti Palace and Boboli Gardens.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=things%20to%20do%20in%20tuscany)

### **Siena**
Florence's medieval rival and a city that feels beautifully frozen in time. The heart of the city is the fan-shaped Piazza del Campo.
*   **Spend an Hour in the Campo:** This is the city's living room. Grab a coffee, find a spot on the bricks, and just watch the world go by. Imagine it filled with sand for the famous Palio horse race.
*   **Climb the Torre del Mangia:** For what is arguably the best view in all of Tuscany, the climb up Siena's tall tower is non-negotiable.
*   **Visit the Duomo di Siena:** A masterpiece of Gothic architecture. Don't miss the intricate marble floors, which are often covered for protection but are revealed for a few weeks each year.

### **Pisa & the Leaning Tower**
You know why you're here. The trick is to do it efficiently.
*   **See the Piazza dei Miracoli:** It's not just the tower. The entire square, with its cathedral (Duomo) and baptistery, is a stunning architectural ensemble.
*   **Take the *Perfect* Photo:** Don't just take the standard ""holding up the tower"" shot. Walk to the nearby lawn for a beautiful, classic view of the entire site.
*   **Explore Beyond:** Most tourists just see the square and leave. Stroll across the Arno River to the *other* leaning tower, the Torre di San Nicola, for a fun local fact and a more authentic Pisa experience.

## Get Lost in the Countryside: Medieval Hill Towns & Rolling Hills

This is the Tuscany of your dreams. Renting a car is essential for this part of the journey.

### **San Gimignano: The ""Manhattan of the Middle Ages""**
Famous for its 14 medieval towers. Climb the **Torre Grossa** for a view that will make you feel like you're flying over the Tuscan hills. Try the world-champion gelato at **Gelateria Dondoli**.

### **Montepulciano: The Wine Lover's Hill Town**
Perched high on a limestone ridge, this town is gorgeous. It's famous for its Vino Nobile wine. Wind your way up the main street, stopping for tastings in ancient cellars carved into the rock.

### **Pienza: The ""Ideal Town""**
A Renaissance-era town designed to be a perfect urban space. It's small, charming, and known for its **Pecorino cheese**. Walk the panoramic promenade for views that have been featured in films like *The English Patient*.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=things%20to%20do%20in%20tuscany)

### **Val d'Orcia: A Living Masterpiece**
This isn't a town, but a whole UNESCO World Heritage valley. As you drive through, you'll recognize every scene. Stop at the chapel of the **Cappella della Madonna di Vitaleta** and the winding roads near **Bagno Vignoni** (a village with a thermal pool in its main square).

***

## For the Foodie & Wine Lover (The *Sapore* of Tuscany)

In Tuscany, eating and drinking are a way of life.

*   **Drive the Strada del Vino Chianti Classico:** This isn't just a road, it's an experience. The route between Florence and Siena is dotted with family-run wineries (**fattorie**) offering tastings and tours. Look for the black rooster logo.
*   **Take a Cooking Class:** Learn to make fresh pasta from a nonna. Many **agritourismos** (farm stays) offer classes where you'll pick vegetables from the garden and cook a multi-course meal. It's one of the most rewarding **things to do in Tuscany**.
*   **Eat a Bistecca alla Fiorentina:** This is no ordinary steak. It's a thick-cut, T-bone porterhouse from a specific local cattle breed, grilled rare over charcoal. Find a trusted trattoria and go hungry.
*   **Discover Pici Pasta:** This thick, hand-rolled spaghetti is a local specialty in the area around Siena. It's simple, rustic, and utterly delicious, often served with a garlic and tomato sauce.

## Unique Experiences & Hidden Gems

Ready to venture off the beaten path?

*   **Soak in the Terme di Saturnia:** These cascading natural hot springs are free to access and open 24/7. Soaking in the warm, milky-blue water under the stars is pure magic.
*   **Explore the Island of Elba:** A short ferry ride from the mainland, Elba offers stunning beaches, clear water, and mountain hiking trails. It’s where Napoleon was exiled, and it's a fantastic seaside escape from the countryside heat.
*   **Visit a Marble Quarry in Carrara:** The majestic white mountains you see from the highway near the coast are not snow—they are marble. Michelangelo sourced his stone here. Guided tours take you deep into the quarries for a truly awe-inspiring industrial spectacle.

I work out of state and flew home for my friends wedding. I was a groomsman and she was a bridesmaid whom i never met.

We hit it off and spent most of the wedding reception making out, feeling eachother, and letting go. 

I was told by a friend that she had a boyfriend, so before i did any of this, i asked her directly. "" do you have a boyfriend"". She denied it and said they broke up.

We spent a week talking, texting, flirting, and having deep conversations. I thought we fit well together and talking was natural. 

The first red flag was her overreaction to a joke directed towards myself that she took as against her. She was looking at navajo jewlery and said i should get her something to remember me by while im gone. I made the simple joke "" ohh i bet ill buy you this and you will forget about me huh"". She took it as a gold digger type of insult to her. Mind you, she is out of my league, but im pretty charming and funny, some girls liked that. I apologised properly after reflecting on it and decided to get her coffee on friday.

 We hung out all day friday, it was good. We were laughing and joking, hugging, etc. She had somewhere to be that night and said we would hang before i left. 

The next day, i shot her a goodmorning text to no response. Followed up a few hours later, nothing. Same thing, nothing. Calls went to voicemail. Facebook messages delivered, not read while she was online. Tiktok comments restricted.

I find out talking to someone she works with, my friend, that she still has a boyfriend and they had a fight the day of the wedding. And that she probably worked it out with him cause they had been together for a while.

The thing that stings the most, is how real i thought she was, she was super honest about everything. But i ended up getting strung along to find out she was just using me. It also sucks cause i bought her a navajo bracelet she really liked and planned to give it to her on her birthday coming up, while i was out of state. ill either just hold onto the bracelet as a reminder or send it to her so she feels bad. Not sure yet.

Also, found out her boyfriend buys her expensive gifts alot, so kind if ironic she took offense to the whole gold digger thing. I didnt lose financially, about 50 bucks, but i lost emotionally because i really thought we had something worthwhile, it all just felt so natural with her.

Ever feel like you woke up as the Tin Man and forgot your oil can? Seriously, some mornings I swear my joints are protesting just getting out of bed! I'm creeping closer to that big 5-0 (okay, fine, I'm *well* past it!), and I've noticed things are... shifting. Not in a good way, either.

Anyone else experiencing this ""stiffness surprise"" after 50?

Well, I've been experimenting (because, honestly, who wants to feel like a rusty robot all the time?) and stumbled across something promising: a 10-minute stretch routine that some are calling an ""un-aging"" miracle. Bold claim, right?

So, mobility miracle or just hype? Let's break it down:

*   **It's FAST:** Seriously, 10 minutes. We're talking less time than it takes to make a decent cup of coffee. That's doable, even for the biggest time-cruncher.
*   **Focus on key areas:** Think hips, shoulders, back... basically, all the places that start to creak and groan the loudest. We believe in strongest people. Check out this free guide I found with some beginner-friendly routines: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts)
*   **No fancy equipment required:** Just you, a floor, and maybe a towel if you're feeling fancy.
*   **Noticeable difference (eventually):** I've been doing it consistently for a couple of weeks now, and I actually *do* feel looser in the mornings. Not magically 20 again, mind you, but definitely less like a rusty gate.

Now, I'm no yoga guru or anything. I'm just a regular person trying to keep my body moving so I can actually *enjoy* my retirement. But honestly, incorporating these stretches has helped. I'm chasing grandkids around without pulling a muscle, and that's a win in my book!

Is it a complete game-changer? Maybe. Maybe not. But it's 10 minutes out of your day.

What's *your* experience with stretching or mobility work? Any tips or tricks you've found that work for you? I'm always looking for new ideas! I'm curious about how you feel about mobility, fitness or exercises to stay fit and active.",1,1762749334.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

We started texting the next day, then hanging out once or twice a week at coffee shops or the park. The first 2 months were good, he would remember every small detail, even my childhood dog or my favourite go-to coffee order. Last month, I noticed the switch... shorter replies, less enthusiasm to make plans. When I brought it up, he said, “You’re overthinking. I’m just busy.” But then he’d still watch my stories minutes after I posted. If I became distant he would say ""Are u ok?, as if he just didn't want me to forget about him.  I did not even know what we were anymore. I’ve tried to leave twice, both times he pulled me back in with a long voice note about how he “cares deeply” but “isn’t good with emotions.”  

So I walked away and went no contact, I found out he was dating someone else. Maybe my boundaries and standards are TOO high and he couldn't keep up. 

(ABSOLUTELY NOT JUDGING OTHERS) I don't drink or smoke, I don't party, I maintain one arm distance with any guy, I am not close to male friends, I have never ever been on dating apps, no intimacy before marriage, no revealing dresses, etc. I also expect intentional gestures with effort such as handwritten letters, personalised playlists, things that are extremely thoughtful etc. If there's no commitment I won't even say ""I love you"", it has to be official, I won't even call them with cute names, I'd call him with his full name like his HR. 

Singlehood is a gift. No contact doesn't feel like me stopping myself from texting him, it rather feels like freedom from a bag of trash. My goal isn't a man, it's my own apartment, a car, travelling the world, a well paid job, and spoiling my family and friends with LOTS AND LOTS OF GIFTS.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Utah Jazz: A One-Way Street or a Three-Pointer to Nowhere?**

The Minnesota Timberwolves, currently riding a post-Thanksgiving food-coma level of dominance (5-4 record), face the Utah Jazz on November 10, 2025, in a game that’s less of a contest and more of a math problem. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a Twitter thread written by a sleep-deprived analyst.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Feels Like a Foregone Conclusion

The Timberwolves are favored by **-7.5 points** across most books, with the total set at **234.5 points**. Translating that into implied probabilities? Minnesota’s 1.34 decimal odds (per DraftKings) suggest a **74.6% chance to win**, while Utah’s 3.35 odds imply the Jazz are a **23.9% shot**. To put that in perspective, it’s like betting your dog will eventually stop digging in the yard versus betting it will start reciting Shakespeare.

Key stats? Minnesota’s offense ranks **5th in the NBA** (118.8 PPG), while Utah’s defense is the NBA’s leakiest sieve—**last in points allowed (121.7 PPG)**. The Wolves just smoked the Jazz **137-97** in their last meeting, a game so lopsided it made the Jazz’s coaching staff question whether they’d accidentally play 4-on-5 for the entire second half.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Depth, and Why the Jazz Should Pack a Towel

The Timberwolves are healthy enough to field a starting five that could bench a rookie and still win a trivia contest about 90s boy bands. **Anthony Edwards**, their human highlight reel, is on fire: 25.8 PPG average, 37 points in the Jazz game, and a smile so wide it could power a small city. **Donte DiVincenzo** is the NBA’s version of a coffee addict—hooked on threes. He’s averaging **3.3 3PM per game** (42.3% clip) and has made **five or more threes** in three of his last five games. Imagine if the Jazz’s defense treated him like a normal human being instead of a free-throw contest entrant.

The Jazz? They’re the NBA’s version of a group project where everyone forgot to show up. Key absences include **Lauri Markkanen** (indefinite) and **Walker Kessler** (questionable), leaving them with the frontcourt depth of a team that raid

from trillions to zero by 2032 with bot swarms scaling 4x/year. It cuts dependency by closing loops on food (50% local by boot, 100% by '32), waste-to-watts (98% nutrient recycle), soil detox (400M m³/year greened via bacterial brigades), and propellant (1k Starship loads/year from CO2 and H2O), freeing Starships for people, not potatoes—saving $102T/decade while boosting QOL 40% through garden therapy and Sunday ribeye rituals that rally ranks and rally sanity.

value add? It's the force multiplier: Psych surge from dirt-digs and petal parties fixes fade (NASA's CHAPEA nods), productivity pops 30% over freeze-dried drudgery, and community cookouts over bot-basted brisket forge unbreakable bonds, turning outposts into outlandish optimism hubs.

Success odds? Skyrockets from 20% (existing resupply roulette) to 90%—no single-point failure on Earth hauls, faster swarm scaling dodges dust devils, and self-sustaining cities make multiplanetary mandatory, not maybe. Humanity's backup drive? Installed, insured, and idiot-proof. Let's make Mars a feast, not a famine—before the bugs eat us out of house and habitat. 🚀🥩",1,1762749016.0,terraformingmars,0,1.0,False

1ot4fl4,https://youtu.be/LL7-_k9FXUY,4 Very Scary TRUE Dead of Night Roadside Horror Stories,"# ""The Red Dodge"":

I was seventeen, working the late shift at a doughnut shop in Tampa. It was one of those humid nights where the air felt heavy enough to choke on, and the streets after midnight had that eerie, empty quiet that made the world feel abandoned. When I finally locked up and got on my bike, I was too lost in my thoughts to notice anything unusual—too busy replaying all the things going wrong in my life. I had no idea that someone was waiting for me, hidden in the dark.

As I cut through a church parking lot around two in the morning—a shortcut I’d taken a hundred times before—a man suddenly stepped out from behind a parked car. Before I could react, his hand shot out, grabbing me by the neck and yanking me clean off my bike. I hit the pavement hard. Then I felt it: the cold press of a gun barrel against my temple.

“Don’t make a sound,” he hissed, his breath hot against my ear.

I froze. My mind split between disbelief and raw terror. He dragged me toward a car—a red Dodge, older model, the kind with wide doors and the smell of stale smoke baked into the seats. He shoved me inside, bound my hands with what felt like a belt, gagged me, then blindfolded me. I could feel the engine rumbling before I even heard it. And then we were moving. Fast.

Panic came in waves. My chest felt like it might explode. Every worst possibility flashed in my mind, and yet, through all that fear, something hard and steady sparked inside me: *I have to survive this.*

I focused on everything I could sense. Through a tiny gap in the blindfold, I caught fragments of the car’s interior—the white leather seats, the red carpeting, the word *Magnum* on the dashboard. I memorized each bump in the road, every turn he took, the rhythm of acceleration and braking. I didn’t know where I was going, but I was determined to remember how to get back.

After what felt like half an hour, the car stopped. He yanked me out, guided me up a flight of stairs—I counted them: fourteen—and into a small room that smelled faintly of cigarettes and old carpet. He pulled the gag from my mouth but left the blindfold on.

“Sit down,” he said. His voice wasn’t angry—just flat, controlled. That calm was somehow worse.

I sat on the edge of what felt like a bed. Then came the questions. “What’s your name? How old are you?” I answered truthfully, hoping honesty might make him see me as a person, not just a target. But then the assaults began. They blurred together—pain, fear, humiliation—until time lost meaning. I kept my breathing steady, telling myself that if I stayed calm, I might live long enough to get out.

At some point, he turned on the TV. The sound of a newscaster’s voice filled the silence, and then I heard it—my name. My picture flashed on the screen. I gasped. He turned sharply toward me.

“If you scream again,” he said coldly, “I’ll have to put a bullet in your head. Stop your crying.”

The way he said *have to* stuck with me. It sounded rehearsed, conflicted—like a man convincing himself. I decided to use that. I spoke softly, choosing my words carefully. “Why are you doing this?”

“I hate women,” he said. “They’ve all hurt me. This is payback.”

I nodded like I understood. “Yeah… I get it. People can be cruel. But I’m not like that. My dad’s really sick—he needs me. I can’t just disappear.” It was a lie, but I needed him to believe there was still something human in me, something worth sparing.

I kept him talking. About his life. About his pain. Anything to keep him from losing control again. “You could let me go,” I said gently. “I won’t tell anyone. I could even be your girlfriend—just... not like this. No one has to know.”

He went quiet. Then he said, almost childlike, “You promise?”

“Yes,” I said quickly, even though I didn’t mean it.

From that moment, I began leaving clues. When he let me use the bathroom, I made sure to touch everything—the sink, the doorknob, the counter. I even rinsed my hair in the shower so strands would stay behind. I counted steps—twenty-four from the room to the bathroom—and memorized the smell of pine from the air freshener. Anything that could lead the police to him later.

The hours crawled by. He assaulted me again, and in between, he’d talk like we were old friends. I played along, even as I fought to hold myself together. When he mentioned other women he’d hurt, I pretended to sympathize. “That must have been hard,” I said softly, making him believe I saw him, even when I wanted to disappear.

By the next afternoon, his mood shifted. The anger had drained from him, replaced by something uncertain. “You’re different,” he murmured. “Not like the others.”

And then—almost casually—he said, “Okay. I’ll let you go. But if you tell anyone, I’ll find you.”

He blindfolded me again, tied my hands loosely, and drove. I listened carefully: the engine sounds, the turns, the stops. We paused at an ATM—heard the beep of buttons—then a gas station, the squeak of a pump handle. When he asked where I lived, I gave an address near my grandmother’s house, not the real one.

Around four in the morning, the car rolled to a stop. “Wait five minutes after I leave,” he said. “Then take off the blindfold.”

He slammed the door, got in, and drove off.

I counted to three hundred, every second stretching forever. Then I pulled the cloth from my eyes. I was behind a building, an oak tree looming nearby, the faint hum of highway traffic in the distance. I ran. I didn’t look back.

When I burst into my grandmother’s house, pounding on the door, she and her boyfriend stared at me like I was crazy. My voice cracked as I told them what happened. They hesitated, unsure whether to believe me—but I made them call the police.

At the station, I gave them everything: the car, the mustache, the fourteen stairs, the pine air freshener, the “Magnum” logo. One detective listened—really listened—and pieced it all together.

Days later, they caught him. He wasn’t just a kidnapper. He was a serial killer. Other girls hadn’t been as lucky.

What saved me wasn’t strength—it was memory, and the stubborn belief that I could outthink him, even in hell.

But survival has a cost. You walk out of something like that, and the world never feels safe again. The fear dulls, but it never truly leaves.





# ""State Line"":

I was just nineteen back then, stationed at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha. Life felt simple most days — morning drills, late-night jokes in the barracks, cheap cafeteria food, and talk about where we’d go once our enlistments ended. That weekend, my roommate Tracy and I were bored out of our minds. Our friend Lisa, from another unit, had this old, wheezing Chevy that always smelled like gas and vinyl. She kept saying we should take a drive somewhere — “just to breathe air that doesn’t smell like jet fuel.”

Kansas City wasn’t far, maybe four hours if we kept it steady. Sounded perfect. No plan, no curfew, just a road and three young women with too much energy and too little sense. We packed light — extra shirts, a cassette mix, a couple sodas — and left that Saturday afternoon, laughing about nothing, radio turned up, windows down, the flat Nebraska wind in our hair.

The drive was easy at first. Endless cornfields, long shadows stretching across the highway. Lisa had a heavy foot, always did, and Tracy kept teasing her about it. I sat in the back, legs tucked up, watching the sky melt from gold to copper. We were just kids pretending to be adults.

Then the blue lights appeared in the mirror.

Lisa muttered a curse under her breath and eased the Chevy to the shoulder. “I wasn’t even going that fast,” she said, knuckles tight on the wheel. The patrol car pulled up behind us, lights spinning against the tall corn. For a moment, nobody moved. Then the trooper’s door opened.

He was big. Broad shoulders, tan uniform pulled tight, hat brim low. Mirrored sunglasses still on though the sun was almost gone. He walked slow, deliberate, hand resting near his gun like he’d practiced it a thousand times. He tapped the window once.

Lisa rolled it down. “Evening, officer.”

“License and registration,” he said, voice flat, no greeting. She handed them over. He looked at the papers, then at her. Then Tracy. Then me, in the back seat. His gaze lingered — not curious, not polite — just *measuring.* Something in it made the air in that car go cold.

We were two Black girls and one white, all in Air Force T-shirts and fatigues. Maybe that was what caught his attention. Maybe it was something else.

“You’re speeding,” he said finally.

Lisa nodded. “Sorry, officer. Won’t happen again.”

He didn’t move. Didn’t give the papers back. Just stared, face blank. Then, slowly, he said, “Follow me.”

Lisa frowned. “Excuse me?”

“Follow me to the station,” he said. “Or I take you in now.” His hand drifted to the cuffs on his belt. “Your choice.”

We froze. Tracy’s hand brushed mine in the back seat, fingers trembling.

Lisa’s voice was barely a whisper. “For speeding?”

He tilted his head. “Follow me.” Then he walked back to his cruiser and got in, lights still flashing.

Lisa started the car, engine rumbling. “This feels wrong,” Tracy said.

“I know,” Lisa whispered. “But he’s a cop. He’s got my license.”

So we followed.

The highway gave way to smaller roads, then gravel, then dirt. The fields on both sides seemed to close in, corn towering higher as the sky turned to ink. The cruiser’s taillights glowed red through the dust, leading us deeper into nowhere. No houses. No traffic. Just the hum of our engine and the rattle of pebbles under the tires.

I tried to tell myself it made sense — maybe the station was small, maybe out of the way — but it didn’t *feel* right. Every mile made my chest tighter. Tracy kept glancing back, like she expected someone to appear out of the dark.

Then the cruiser turned into a clearing.

An old barn sat there, half-collapsed, surrounded by rusted pickups. The metal glowed dull orange under a single hanging light. A few men stood around, leaning on the trucks. They looked like farmers or something rougher — shirts unbuttoned, shotguns resting easy against their legs, cans of beer in hand. When they saw us pull in, they straightened and stared.

Lisa’s hands trembled on the wheel.

The trooper got out, walked to our window, and pointed. “You,” he said to Lisa. “Out.”

“What about them?” she asked, her voice cracking just a little.

He smiled then — slow, thin, mean. “They wait.”

I could feel Tracy’s pulse hammering through her hand as she squeezed mine.

Lisa stepped out, every movement stiff, careful. The trooper led her toward his cruiser. They got inside, and the door shut.

The men by the barn kept watching us. One spat. Another grinned, whispering something that made the rest laugh low. My heart was beating so loud I could hear it in my ears.

“What’s he doing?” Tracy whispered.

“I don’t know.”

Minutes passed. The night pressed in, heavy and silent except for the crickets and our breathing. The barn loomed like a mouth ready to swallow us whole.

Then the cruiser door flew open.

Lisa stumbled out, face streaked with tears. She ran to the car, slammed the door, and gunned it. Gravel sprayed, the men stepped back, and we tore down that dirt road so fast the headlights shook. Nobody followed. I looked back once — the trooper just stood there, arms crossed, watching us vanish into the dark.

We didn’t stop until we hit the interstate.

“Pull over,” Tracy said finally, voice barely holding together.

Lisa eased to the shoulder. Her hands were shaking so badly she couldn’t get the key out at first. The engine idled rough.

“What happened?” I asked.

She stared straight ahead. “He said you two were trouble.” Her voice was hollow. “Used words I won’t repeat. Said if I didn’t… do something for him, he’d let those men have us. Said they’d make sure we ‘learned our place.’”

Tracy covered her mouth, eyes wet.

Lisa shook her head. “I started crying. Told him we were military. Showed him the base IDs. Everything changed. He went quiet. Told me to get out. Said, ‘Don’t come back this way.’ Then he gave me my license and just… stood there.”

We sat in silence, the car humming, headlights cutting through the black. The fear hit all at once — what if he hadn’t seen the IDs? What if we’d run? Who would’ve found us out there?

We drove straight back to base. No music, no talking. Just the sound of the tires and the wind and the three of us trying to breathe.

At the gate, the guards waved us through. We were safe. Supposedly.

We never reported it. Not then. Three young girls, two Black, one white — who would believe it? And even if they did, what would it change?

Lisa and I drifted apart after that. Tracy and I promised never to talk about it again. Years later, I heard rumors — about that stretch of road, bad cops gone missing, barns that burned in the night. Maybe someone found out. Maybe not.

But I still think about that night — about the way his sunglasses reflected our faces, about the dirt road curling into the dark, about how close we came to disappearing forever.

Now, every time blue lights flash in my mirror, my stomach knots. I drive slow, careful, quiet. Because you never really know who’s out there — waiting in the dark.





# ""The Bushland"":

It was a quiet December night in 1994 when my life changed forever. The parking lot outside my apartment in Port Elizabeth was still, the hum of distant traffic fading into the darkness. I had just come home from a night out with friends—pizza, laughter, the kind of easy warmth that made the world feel safe. I switched off the ignition and reached for my purse, ready to head inside, when a sudden knock on my driver’s-side window made my heart jolt.

A young man stood outside—mid-twenties maybe, clean-shaven, wearing a plain shirt. His expression seemed calm, polite even, as he motioned for me to roll the window down. I lowered it just an inch.

“Excuse me, miss,” he said softly. “I’m lost. Can you tell me how to get to the main road?”

I began to gesture toward the street when, without warning, the passenger door yanked open. Another man slid in fast, his movements sharp and controlled. A knife flashed in his hand, catching the streetlight—a long, thin blade, trembling just slightly as it pressed against my ribs.

“Move over,” he said flatly. “Don’t make a sound, or this goes in.”

My breath caught in my throat. I did as he said, sliding across to the passenger seat, trying to stay calm, to think. The first man slipped behind the wheel and started the car. He drove off slowly, blending into the quiet streets as though nothing was wrong.

“We’re just borrowing your car for a bit,” the driver said, glancing at me with an easy smile. “We’ll drive around, have some fun. You’ll be home soon.”

The man with the knife chuckled. “Yeah, don’t worry. We do this all the time.”

We drove through familiar streets, past late-night shops with their lights flickering out one by one. I thought of jumping out, of screaming—but the knife pressed harder, reminding me how close death was. I swallowed and tried to reason with them. “Please,” I said, my voice barely audible. “I have money in my purse. Take it, take the car—just let me go.”

The driver shook his head. “No need for that. Just sit tight.”

Streetlights gave way to open darkness. The city fell behind us. The road narrowed, turning into gravel, then dirt. I felt the tires bump over rocks, the air growing cooler and stiller. “Where are we going?” I asked, trying to mask the tremor in my voice.

“Somewhere quiet,” the man beside me said, a faint smile curving his lips. “To talk.”

When the car stopped, we were in a clearing surrounded by thick bushland—one of those picnic spots that looked harmless in daylight but felt menacing after dark. The engine died, and silence closed in.

“Get out,” the driver ordered.

I hesitated. The knife pressed harder into my side, and I obeyed. The night air smelled of salt and dust. Somewhere in the distance, I could hear waves crashing—a cruel reminder of how close civilization was.

They led me deeper into the brush, my feet stumbling over roots. Then everything unraveled. The one with the knife grabbed my arm roughly. “You think you’re better than us?” he sneered.

“No, please,” I begged. “I just want to go home.”

They didn’t listen. The next moments were a blur of violence—pain, fear, humiliation. I screamed until my voice broke, but the night swallowed every sound. When it was over, I lay trembling, covered in dirt and blood, listening to them talk as if I were nothing.

“We can’t let her talk,” the driver muttered.

“Yeah,” the other agreed. “Finish it.”

The knife returned, glinting in the dim light. The first stab tore into my stomach, then another, and another. The pain was beyond anything I’d ever known—white-hot, blinding. I felt my body giving way, but I clung to consciousness, to the smallest flicker of survival. Then they slashed at my throat—again, again—until warm blood streamed down my chest and the world went dim.

“She’s done,” one of them said.

Their footsteps faded, the engine roared to life, and then—silence. I was alone.

For a long time, I lay there, half-buried in the dirt, waiting for death. But something inside refused to quit. My body screamed with pain, but I forced myself to breathe. I thought of my family, my friends, the life I hadn’t finished living.

With one trembling hand, I pressed my abdomen to keep my insides from spilling out. With the other, I held my throat, feeling the deep, wet gashes. Inch by inch, I began to crawl. The bushes tore at my skin; every movement sent a shock of agony through me. Still, I kept going.

Eventually, I reached the edge of the road. Cars passed, their headlights washing over me before fading back into the night. I waved weakly, but no one stopped—until a small car slowed to a halt. A young man got out, eyes wide with horror.

“Oh my God,” he gasped. “What happened? Hold on, I’m calling for help.”

He knelt beside me, his voice trembling but steady enough to comfort. “Stay with me. You’re going to be okay.” He took off his jacket, wrapping it around me, pressing it against my wounds to slow the bleeding.

I couldn’t speak; my throat was destroyed. So I dipped a finger into the blood pooling beneath me and wrote the only clue I had—the names I’d heard them call each other—*Frans* and *Theuns*.

By the time paramedics arrived, I was barely conscious. They later told me that my head had been nearly severed, my throat and abdomen carved open. Thirty stab wounds. Yet somehow, my heart kept beating.

Surgeons worked through the night, piecing me back together. Against every odd, I survived. The police traced the names I’d written and found the men—Frans du Toit and Theuns Kruger—repeat offenders with a history of violence.

Months later, I faced them in court. No screens, no distance. I told the truth, every brutal detail, because they needed to hear it—and because I needed to reclaim my voice. Both were sentenced to life in prison.

The scars remain, inside and out, but so does the strength I found that night. I learned that survival isn’t just about living through the pain—it’s about refusing to let darkness define you.

Sometimes, when I park my car and sit in silence for a moment, I remember that December night—the knock on the window, the calm voice, the blade catching the light—and I remind myself how fragile life is, and how powerful hope can be when everything else is taken away.





# ""Twenty Feet Away"":

It was just past one in the morning when I finally clocked out from the small rural clinic where I worked as a nurse. The last patient had been a farmhand with a nasty hand injury, and the smell of antiseptic still clung to my scrubs as I stepped into the cold air. The drive home was familiar—thirty miles of empty county roads winding through farmland and forgotten towns. Usually, I liked the solitude, the soft hum of my old car engine and the endless dark fields on either side. But that night, something felt… off.

The sky was moonless, a black canvas swallowing the world beyond the reach of my headlights. The beams sliced through mist pooling low across the road, making everything look unreal—like the kind of silence that comes before something bad happens.

About ten minutes into the drive, I saw it. A shape up ahead on the shoulder—hunched, unmoving. My first thought was that it was an animal, maybe a deer hit by a car. I slowed down out of habit, easing my foot off the gas. The figure stirred, straightened. A man.

He staggered forward and waved one arm weakly, the other hanging limp at his side. Even from a distance, I could tell something wasn’t right—his clothes were torn, dark stains soaked through the fabric. My instincts as a nurse kicked in, overriding the unease prickling in my chest.

I pulled over about twenty feet away, leaving the engine running. The ticking of the cooling engine and the faint chirp of crickets were the only sounds. I rolled the window down an inch.

“Are you okay? Do you need help?”

He turned toward me, and my breath caught. Blood covered him—thick and glistening, smeared across his face and neck. A deep gash split his forehead, and his left arm bent at an impossible angle. He limped toward the car, his eyes wide and glassy in the glare of my headlights.

“Yeah,” he croaked, his voice raw. “Got hit by a car. Please—help me. My leg… it hurts bad.”

Every instinct I had screamed to help, but something about him made my pulse jump. It was the way he moved—too steady, too deliberate for someone that injured.

“Okay, just stay there,” I said, trying to sound calm. “I’ll call an ambulance. Don’t move.”

His head snapped up. “No ambulance,” he said quickly, limping closer. “Just give me a ride to town. Please—it’s not far.”

He was only ten feet away now, and I could see the whites of his eyes darting, his expression flickering between panic and calculation. I tightened my grip on the wheel.

“I can’t let you in,” I said. “I’ll get help here fast.”

“Come on!” he shouted suddenly, slapping a bloody palm against the glass. The sound cracked through the quiet like a gunshot. “I’m bleeding out here! You can’t just leave me!”

My stomach dropped. His voice wasn’t pleading anymore—it was angry. Demanding. I hit the lock button, the doors clicking shut.

He yanked at the handle, rattling it violently. “Let me in!” His face pressed against the glass, twisted with rage, blood smearing where his cheek met the window.

That was it. I slammed the car into drive and hit the gas. Gravel spat from the tires as I lurched forward, the rear fishtailing for a second before gripping the asphalt. In the rearview mirror, I saw him stumble back, his silhouette shrinking in the glow of the taillights.

My hands trembled on the steering wheel as I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.

“911, what’s your emergency?” The operator’s calm voice steadied me just enough to speak.

“There’s a man on the side of County Road 14,” I said, breathless. “Covered in blood—said he was hit by a car. He tried to get into my vehicle. I think he’s dangerous.”

The operator asked for my location, my name, every detail I could recall. I told her about the torn clothes, the broken arm, the blood—too much blood.

“Stay on the line,” she said. “Units are on the way. Are you somewhere safe?”

“I’m driving home,” I whispered, glancing into the rearview mirror again. No lights. No movement. Just the empty road stretching endlessly behind me.

It felt like the longest drive of my life. Every shadow looked like him—every roadside reflector like a figure waiting to step into the beam of my headlights. When I finally pulled into my driveway, I didn’t get out. I just sat there, doors locked, heart pounding, the 911 operator’s voice a lifeline in my ear until a deputy called me directly.

“Ma’am, this is Deputy Harris,” he said. “We found the man you described. He’s in custody now.”

“In custody?” I asked. “So he’s okay?”

“He’s alive,” the deputy said. “But he wasn’t hit by a car. He stole one earlier tonight—crashed it about a mile from where you saw him. Wanted for assault and theft in the next county over. You did the right thing not letting him in. Some of that blood was his, but we think some wasn’t.”

A cold shiver ran through me. “You mean—?”

“We’re checking it out,” he said quietly. “But you were lucky, ma’am. Real lucky.”

That night replayed in my mind for weeks. I scrubbed the blood from my car door the next morning, but I couldn’t wash away the memory of his handprint sliding down the glass. I stopped taking night shifts, started locking my doors twice, even installed a motion light by the driveway.

A month later, I ran into one of my clinic patients at the grocery store—a talkative older woman who liked to gossip. She’d heard about my encounter.

“Scary thing, that,” she said, bagging her apples. “My cousin had something like that happen last year. Guy flagged her down, said he was hurt. Tried to rob her when she stopped. Same road, too.”

The words chilled me. I went home and started digging through old local news articles, reading by the light of my kitchen lamp. There they were—stories scattered over the past few years. Men pretending to be injured, waving down cars late at night. Some ended in robberies. A few ended worse.

Robert Kline, the man from that night, wasn’t the first—and he wouldn’t be the last.

I told my coworkers, warned them during a coffee break. “If you ever see someone hurt on those back roads,” I said, “don’t stop. Call it in, but don’t stop.”

They nodded, wide-eyed. One young aide asked, “What did he look like up close?”

I thought for a long moment before answering. “Like someone who could make you believe him—for a second. That’s all it would’ve taken.”

Sometimes, when I drive home after dark, I still glance at the side of the road. Every shape in the shadows makes my pulse quicken. Because I know now that not everyone waving for help wants to be saved.",1,1762748722.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I like people who are real. The ones who tell stories that go somewhere, even if it takes a while. The ones who actually laugh when something’s funny and don’t force it.

I don’t need attention, just good conversation. The kind that sneaks up on you and makes the day feel lighter. If you’ve got something interesting on your mind or just want to trade thoughts, I’m around.
