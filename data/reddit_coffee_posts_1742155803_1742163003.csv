1jcwjx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1jcwjx6/in_need_of_support/,In need of support,"TRIGGER WARNING: Domestic Violence 

I, 24 F, have been with my now ex boyfriend for almost 6 years. Everything was great for 2 years until we moved to another state so I could create distance with my toxic and controlling family. I was 20 and naive and thought it was a great idea to move to a state where I didn’t know anyone to “start over” and create the life I wanted with what I thought was a wonderful man. Shortly after living together, he became mean, compared me to pornstars, belittled me and just kept screaming and throwing things over the smallest disagreement (I.e. I didn’t do laundry like his mother did because I put the detergent cap in the washer with the clothes to clean it off so he smashed the coffee table.) I developed an eating disorder and blamed myself for 2 years thinking I was broken, not good enough, and always the problem. It was always “if I could just do this ____ he’d loved me and be nice to me”. I did so much research into my own personal issues to work on them and I even went to therapy. The verbal quickly became physical but started gradually. Hitting me as hard as he could with pillows to shoving me against wall to threatening to hit me to actually hitting me, throwing me around, crushing my against doors, headbutted me in the face until he broke my nose, messed up my jaw, stomped on me and so much more. For the past year I’ve been coping by abusing alcohol (I know, not great). Recently, I got really drunk and was in a really bad place mentally and exposed him and his behavior to my best friend. It’s two weeks post telling my story to close friends and I’ve finally broke up with him but unfortunately we do own a house together (I was in the mindset of if I was going to suffer I wanted something stable because out living arrangements was not stable at the time). We have agreed to be roommates because neither of us can afford anywhere to live without the other. I always was to add that the assault wasn’t constant. It was just when he got really angry so I can’t even put a “this many time month/ week” on it. It was unpredictable. I also would like to add I am a full time working college student as well. 

Has anyone been through anything similar? What did you do about the house? How did you find support? I love the house we have, our beautiful dog, I love my job and my education and my biggest fear is losing any of it because it’s all I have. I don’t have much family. When I told my parents (after the very first incident) they blamed and disowned me. I’m very much alone other than the support I’ve found in my 2 friends. It all just feels like too much to juggle with an already full plate but I want to rebuild my life and I want to be happy. It’s been so long. ",1,1742161331.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False
1jcwh9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/DadForAMinute/comments/1jcwh9j/dad_am_i_causing_trouble_here/,"Dad, am I causing trouble here?","Let's go back to start of my teenage years. I started picking up little arguments with my parents, nothing major, classic temper tantrums and sometimes, just stating my opinions which my parents took as talking back. Sometimes, I crossed the line which my father sorted with a conversation if the argument was with my mom or with his belt if it was with him.

Things started escalating as years passed. The arguments became more serious and I started being more disrespectful and moody in general to the point I risked ruining my relationship with them forever a few days back.

All throughout these years, my father was very moody around me. When I was in my early teens, he'd scold me when I said hi to him (he thought it was disrespectful to talk to your father that way) and ignore me when I asked how his day was. But sometimes, he'd respond nicely and also initiate conversations. He still behaves this way. I think it's just the pressure from work that makes him behave this way but that doesn't change the fact that I've probably locked myself up and cried plenty of times because he was being rude to me for no reason.

He sometimes takes interest in my conversations and sometimes he doesn't, again depends on his mood. In the last few years, he has become incredibly strict with me, yelling at me for the smallest mistakes I make. However, I feel he's not doing it to hurt me and instead thinks it'll help me improve myself.

His dad was a classic old school stereotypical dad , so, I don't completely blame him for how he thinks a father-child relationship should be. 

He wants me to treat him like he treated his dad. He's extremely extremely extremely respectful towards his dad (the three extremelys are not enough to show how much he loves & respects his dad) but that is not the kind of relationship I wish to foster. 

I've always thought of all humans to be equal but I don't mind a little regard for older folks and respecting them but I don't believe in complete submission to someone and I believe a person's first responsibility should be towards protecting their self respect and freedom.

So, if I think I'm being wrongfully scolded, I retaliate. I state what I think and point out the double standards (there are many things that he wants me to do when he doesn't do them himself). I firmly believe a parent should lead by example.
My mother asks me to not retaliate and just let it go but tells me that I'm making the right arguments in private.

Now, my dad isn't the only one in the wrong. Despite everything that happens, he still loves me and is always there for me and I can get really disrespectful sometimes. But he sometimes mistakes me voicing my opinion as talking back and being disrespectful.

The second part, my mother has always pampered me. I'll be an adult next year but she still does everything for me. I have a reason, last few years I've been extremely busy with my studies and we've all fell in this routine where she does everything for me. I don't really want to leave this comfort zone as I'll be leaving for college next year which I why I wish to mend things with my father (I might not ever be back home once I go to college; I'll obviously visit but I mean staying at home like I do now)

My father has always opposed this and says she should let me do stuff on my own. For the record, I know how to do everything my mother does for me, so, I would still be able to function when I move out. However, life will always be busy and I think I should learn how to manage my daily tasks along with studies.

But since, my mom does everything for me, guess what, she does everything for my dad too and when she's not around, he wants me to things for him. Well, not all things but 50% of the things. Making him coffee, getting him water, etc. I am not the happiest person when doing these tasks, not because I'm lazy but because my father will refuse to help me in the simplest ways 80% of the times. There's something right behind his back and I ask him to pass it, he won't. He's walking past a table and I need something, he won't get it for me. He's moody, so, he does what I ask 20% of the time. I still have to do everything he asks me too because what other option do I have but I make sure he knows I'm not happy doing what he's asked.

As I mentioned I don't have responsibilities around the house and I would be ready to accept chores if my dad did too. I hate the idea of seeing my dad sit around not doing anything while mom and I do the chores. He does look after my dog though which counts as a chore, so, I feel I'm again in the wrong.

I've been assigned a chore once and I didn't really stick to it due to my schedule. So, I do think my father not helping me is a way to teach me responsibility but then it's again the hypocrisy that stings. Today as soon as he got off work, he asked mom for dinner. My mom works too and also takes care of the house. So, she had just lied down and told him that it was kept in the kitchen and to get it himself, but he refused and asked her to serve it when she gets up. 

Two major questions here as far as I understand are, first, me thinking I should be treated somewhat equal to my dad in a way that the respect he wishes I give him should be reciprocated. I don't want to be on my best behaviour just to be ignored and not even glanced at when I ask him how his day was. Is thinking I'm almost equal to my dad fine? My simple explanation for this thinking is that we're both human.

Secondly, my mother suffers from excessive workload because my dad doesn't help around a lot and neither do I because, as I said, I don't want us to be managing the house while he sits & scrolls his phone. Should I put my ego aside? I feel my ego is taking precedence over love for my mom.

I'm sure there are plenty of other things you could give for feedback on and as I always state while posting, please be honest.",1,1742161131.0,DadForAMinute,0,1.0,False

We hung out almost every day. Went out for coffee, dinner dates, concerts, shooting ranges, activities etc. she never offered to pay for anything. I always picked and dropped her, although she lived 5 minutes from my parents’ place. I got her gifts too from Germany. 
She also works full time, so I was expecting her to at least extend an offer to pay.

1jcwa92,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1jcwa92/academic_year_spending_in_review_first_year_med/,academic year spending in review (first year med school),"super belated post - meant to do this way back in August but as with everything else in my life, other things got in the way 🤡. This is a review of how much I spent in my first year of medical school (from \~July 2023 to July 2024) and I'm aiming to this every year to see how things change. 

For some background, 23/24F (at the time) in MCOL east coast city with very generous financial aid and support from school and parents. Since this past year, I’ve had a couple of big changes: increased financial aid to full ride (tuition and living expenses), got a car (for clinical rotations), and am now single lol – we’ll see how these changes impacted my second year finances...

# “income”: 

**$41248.33 💰**

* parents: $36860 – usually got about 3000 per month for living expenses. Extra probably includes presents (i usually get cash rather than actual gifts) and reimbursements for random stuff…
* tax return: $610.34 – from my gap year job
* summer research stipend: $2445.84
* “free money” (interest, cashback, SUB): $1332.15 

# expenses: 

**$36043.03** (monthly avg $3003.59) **💸**

**$29678.03** (excluding tuition, monthly avg $2473.17)💸

**rent: $18767 (monthly, $1540 with deposit and set up fees)🏡**

* for a studio in a MCOL East coast city. I could definitely find a cheaper place but I don't want to move around so much especially since I'm close to the downtown area. I'm happy with my current place and will likely stay here until I graduate

**moving: $1138.53 🚚📦**

* includes things like dinnerware, utensils, furniture etc. could have spent less but I love buying well-designed things lol. My parents also paid for an ikea trip and other big furniture items so true total cost is maybe \~$2000. I could have moved everything directly from my undergrad/gap year midwest city but this was logistically complicated since I moved out in May, came home for the summer, solo tripped to Asia, and moved to med school late July. I also think this option would have cost about the same or even more

**house: $732.44 🧹🫧🧽**

* includes daily household things like toothpaste, soap, vacuum filters etc which I mostly have bought in bulk so hoping I need to spend less next year. also include nicer kitchenware things like a Staub dutch oven ($158.96). I'm debating of getting a toaster oven/air fryer but haven't decided yet

**utilities: $1309.09 (monthly avg, $109.09) 💦⚡️🛜**

* water: $404.29 (monthly avg, 33.69)
* gas/electric: $604.80 (monthly avg, 50.40) 
* wifi: $300 (monthly avg, $25) 

**dining: $2435.16 (monthly avg, $203.01) 🍽️🍱**

* could lower this but I'm happy with the amount of socializing I do (more than I ever have lol). this does include eating out during my trips to NYC which brought up the average

**groceries: $1807.14 (monthly avg, $150.60) 🛒🍎**

* average seems low but this is likely because I did not have to spend much on groceries when I was home for breaks (dec/jan and june). 
* For full transparency I do use my parents’ Costco membership credit card but I only went 2-3 times a semester (Costcos are all out in the suburbs 30 mins away); because of this my true average is probably $200. 

**subscriptions: $90.62 (monthly avg, $7.55) 🎧✅**

* includes apple storage ($0.99/month), spotify family (\~$3.39/month for my share) and now ticktick student premium (annual $27 in July) and also paid for one month of peacock ($2.16) for the summer olympics. I really dislike subscription based models and I can find most of my Asian dramas/anime shows for free anyway

**education: $1070.88 📚🩺**

* close to my own school estimated cost. this includes school supplies, clinical equipment (tuning forks, reflex hammers etc), and question bank subscription (5 year amboss, $699); the question bank seems a lot but it's the only third party resource I've had to buy (other resources have been bootlegged and passed down from class to class haha)

**coffee/tea: $472.19 (monthly avg, $39.35) 🍵☕️**

* separate category because I take my caffeine very seriously lol. high average but this includes coffee equipment I got when I moved in (\~$100) and a massive black friday harneys and son tea haul ($127.72). normally would be \~$15/month for going out to cafes but am including money for coffee beans.

**transport: $919.80 (monthly average, $76.65) ⛽️🚊✈️**

* high because I'm including amtrak tickets to nyc. I now have a car so less money for lyfts/ubers but will have to include budget for gas/tolls/amtrak or flight tickets. I don’t think my flight tickets home are included in this because I mostly used Southwest gift cards purchased from Costco promotions. 

**tuition: $6365 👩🏻‍🏫🎓📚**

**hobbies: $20.66 🎞️📸**

* I think I bought some film? I was kinda sad to see how little time and money I spent on hobbies / stuff outside of school so I got into pottery this year!

**beauty (makeup-skincare): $133.07 🧴💄**

* been pretty much on a low-buy for the past few years but made a few orders to replenish things as I used them up.

**etc: $273.22 🪪🎫**

* this included NYC museum admissions, buckets (budgeting) software license, driver license renewal fee etc

**presents: $255.26🎁**

**clothing: $251.97 🧥👗**

* includes the famed medical school Patagucci and COS pants that I found on sale in NYC! should really get more clothes and shoes but online clothes shopping can be super hit or miss for me.

# reflections: 

My financial goal for medical school is to at least break even so I’m pretty happy to come out with a net savings of \~$5200 – although there are definitely missed expenses as my parents covered them. Since the first two years of medical school tend to be more flexible than the last two, I tried to say yes to more social things and trips (I did 3 NYC trips to see college friends and a few day trips to DC/Virginia) and have no regrets doing so.  

At the beginning of the school year (past August), I didn’t really have set goals and was mostly hoping to keep my spending habits about the same. Now that I’m over half-way through second year, I would say my spending has probably been overall constant although not consistently. With my financial aid increased to include tuition and living expenses, I did notice that I spent more in the fall semester on fun items (some of which related to pre-election-induced stress shopping), but then have decreased post-election. My school has been pretty impacted with the federal research cuts but since my financial aid is likely not going to be changed due to majority/all(?) coming from private donations. I’m starting my clinical rotations later this month (yikes, very nervous), so I'm planning to write an updated money diary within the next few weeks!! ",4,1742160607.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,1.0,False

We matched, really clicked, and went on 2 dates. The first was amazing, but my hormones kicked in, and coupled with my absolutely-not-ready condition, after a brief date 2 it was over (""I'm not ready for a relationship""). I'm hoping she saw through me, and decided to dodge my completely-not-ready self. 🤦‍♂️

Since then, I've done a lot of work, have a stable life, and leveled up my emotional intelligence (knowing I have more work to do).

Fast-forward to today, I'm dipping my toes back in, and... she's there actively looking. So I reached out with a simple ""hi! 👋"", we chat a bit about ""it's been a while.. it would be nice to reconnect"", and planned on coffee next weekend.

1jcw7mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1jcw7mu/tipping_debates_often_miss_the_bigger_issue_whos/,Tipping debates often miss the bigger issue: Who’s really bearing the risk?,"We all agree tipping culture is flawed, but focusing only on “employers vs. customers” ignores a systemic problem: workers are forced to gamble their income on unpredictable factors or corporate promises.  

Tipped workers face unstable pay. A server might earn $300 on a Friday night but only $20 on a Tuesday. After unpaid tasks like cleaning and prep work, plus expenses like grooming (haircuts, salon visits) and work-specific attire (dry cleaning, formal wear) — costs tied directly to employer policies or customer expectations — that “good night” often averages out to minimum wage. Senior workers often get busier shifts, while new hires are stuck with slower times. Research also suggests tipping can sometimes reflect factors beyond service quality.  

This isn’t just a restaurant issue. Delivery drivers cover costs like gas and repairs while apps raise fees without increasing driver pay. Sales jobs highlight high commission dreams but rarely mention the average earnings. Startups lay off workers when funding ends, even if their work was strong. The common thread? Employers profit while workers bear the risk.  

Many industries rely on low-cost labor and resources overseas to keep prices down. For example, coffee farmers earning minimal wages or workers in tough conditions allow corporations to maintain high profits. Tipping culture mirrors this dynamic — employers keep menu prices low by shifting labor costs to customers, just as they keep supply costs low by relying on undervalued labor elsewhere.  

When we debate tipping, we’re really debating who bears the true cost of labor. Tipped workers, gig drivers, and others face the same trap: Their pay depends on external factors (tips, investor decisions, or unfair trade practices) rather than the value they create.  

So what can we do? End sub-minimum wages for tipped workers. Demand transparency — if delivery apps raise fees, show how much actually goes to workers. Support models like co-ops or unions that prioritize fair pay over speculation.  

TL;DR: Tipping debates often blame customers or workers, but the real issue is unfair systems that profit from instability. Let’s push for fairness.  ",0,1742160418.0,tipping,3,0.5,False

1jcw2cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jcw2cz/there_was_something_in_the_woods_with_us_that/,There Was Something In The Woods With Us That Night... (Part 3),"All week the sun had dissipated behind the same horizon. All week the sun had shone over the same house. All week the sun had illuminated the same, disparate little patch of land. I had waited all week for her to come home; she never did. Failing that, I looked for her. Cast aside was my terror, my guilt and my shame. What was left in its place was a shaky, self-deceptive sense of optimism. Before you lambast me for not looking hard enough, it’s difficult to find something that, by all accounts, never existed.

I’ll say before you go any further, and only if you haven’t already, please read [my first posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j9qukn/there_was_something_in_the_woods_with_us_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Be warned however that they won’t answer much, I doubt anything can or will.

You know, I still wake some nights and hope to see her in the usual spot at the foot of my bed; that hope is starting to wane. Following my fruitless search, I called my parents to explain to them the situation and according to them we’ve never had a dog. What am I to think? That I’m making this all up?

A few days following this I came to the conclusion that locking myself in my house, leaving all texts, calls and emails on read and browsing dingy internet forums in search of similar experiences simply wouldn’t help. For the first time in what felt like forever, I crept from my room and tried to uphold the basic façade of normalcy. The resonant hum of the kettle filled the house, I had decided making a tea was the best course of action.

Idly I flicked through my mail which had accumulated in a haphazard pile by the front door. It had been all the usual stuff, the odd letter, a magazine and a few cards but what had really caught my eye was a poster. Bold red font at the top had declared ‘MISSING’ and at the bottom was a paragraph vaguely describing a dog. It had been the picture though, that was what really got me. Captured in blurry monochrome was Lyric.

It had made good kindling.

Let me ask you something. Have you ever felt hungry and opened your fridge only to be disappointed as to the contents? Have you ever, following that, slammed the door shut in frustration before pulling it open once again in hope of a new result? Have you ever, after all of that, ever seen the inside of your fridge… change? No. I guarantee you haven’t.

Events, such as those affecting my fridge were becoming more and more common; alarmingly so. The onset had been so minor I feel embarrassed even mentioning it. First, it had been my mysteriously unlocked phone shifting an inch or two as I slept. Then, it had been doors, previously shut, standing wide open when I woke. On a few occasions my car keys, usually thrown into a dish in the kitchen, appeared under my pillow. Now on their own, these incidents may seem harmless; mildly infuriating at most. But within context they’re undeniably… sinister.

By the time I managed to convince myself to leave my home it had been nearly two weeks since Lyric disappeared. Now it was time and for good reason. Two weeks alone is a long time to mull things over. Your mind wanders in that kind of silence and solitude. I had felt strange pangs of nostalgia. Thoughts of that night in the woods all those years ago, and of Josh and Richard, filled my every waking moment. I had missed them I suppose. So, from the deepest recesses of my memory and my old computer, I dug up two emails. To each of them I sent a single message.

Only Josh responded.

What follows is the email I sent him:

***(ME)***

***Hi Josh!***

***I know this is slightly out of the blue but… just how have you been? To be honest I’m sorry I never reached out sooner. I suppose I apologise for my laziness!***

***What have you been up to? I know you mentioned something about getting into your desired college last we spoke so, how’d that turn out?***

***Personally, I got through college and have been doing a Uni course for the last few months, I’m currently renting this shit little farmhouse nearby; it’s not quite Richard’s countryside getaway lol!***

***Anyway, we should really meet up some time, even just to talk. Coffee shop meetup in the old spot? Drop me an email if you fancy it!***

***I’ve really missed you Josh, take care of yourself and I hope to hear from you soon.***

I had barely leaned back in my chair when the computer pinged to signify incoming mail. The response was tantalisingly brief.

***(JOSH)***

***We should meet up; in person I mean. Are you free this coming Tuesday?***

I thought it over for a few minutes and replied to him. We set a time to meet.

During the days that followed, the strange abnormalities in my home worsened in both frequency and scope. Rooms had begun to re-arrange their layouts; after the first few times I gave up putting the furniture back. Screams, shouts, cries, grunts, groans, hums and whistles, seemingly from no source, filled the house more often than not. Then there was the constant clutter. Drawers and cupboards turned inside out; their contents laid bare across the floors in neat, ordered rows. It was the sublimity and perfection of it all that bothered me the most.

The vibrant chirping of the dawn chorus on Tuesday signalled a second full night without sleep. Strangely, in that time, not a thing had stirred within the house. Wearily I pulled myself from the sofa and lurched towards the bathroom in an attempt to tidy myself. I staggered through the door and looked into the mirror; my reflection was alien to me. It was twisted. Skin sagged under my eyes in grotesque purple bags, my face was pinched and gaunt, slick with grease was my hair after days of being unwashed and my eyes… they were so hollow. It took me nearly half an hour to come to terms with the fact that the emaciated husk in the mirror was me.

I showered and threw on some fairly clean clothes. My reflection looked marginally better, enough so I could pass myself off as just REALLY stressed over exams. Not that I’d been to Uni in two weeks, feigning a family emergency to keep the professors off my back.

It was nearly midday by the time I had found my keys (tucked in an old shoe-box under the bed by my mysterious, room arranging ‘guest’). I was exceptionally late. I peeled down the drive in my beat-up Fiesta and nigh on ran every red light on my way into town.

Town was busy and parking sparse. I eventually found a spot leaving me with a ten minute walk to the coffee shop. After a few minutes of walking, I became filled with impending dread, a feeling that I should turn back. Fight or flight? People drifted past me, fading into a constant stream of colour and noise. Thought after thought tore through my mind as I weighed every possible consequence of what I was about to do. The world became hazy. The constant blaring of a car horn ripped me from my waking slumber and I realised I was stood, frozen, in the middle of the road. My heart fought the confines of my chest, pounding in my ears, feeling as though it would spill from my throat. I struggled against the impulse to retch, to gag, to vomit. My vision blurred and spun as the headlights of the oncoming car distorted into blinding strobe lights, its incessant horn blocking out all sanity. I’d winced at the sudden cacophony and my vision had ceased all together. My legs buckled. I drifted into nothing. My head hit the concrete.

I think it was the breeze that woke me. It gently pushed the hair from my throbbing brow behind my ears and caressed my flushed skin. My mind was rendered silent and hushed. My heart was calm and the furious pounding that had, moments earlier, assaulted my ears was replaced by a dull thrum. I was discarded on a bench, in a park, some distance from the road. Gazing upwards, I sat for a minute or two before I stirred. It was the usual dirty English sky; steel grey and cloud-mottled.

I finally reached the coffee shop a few minutes later. In the near decade since I’d last been there it hadn’t changed at all. I was late. I hoped Josh hadn’t left.

He hadn't.

Much like the dull fluorescent lights and suspiciously sticky seats of the chosen establishment, Josh hadn’t changed a bit. He was older, taller and all that but it was still irrevocably him. He sipped at the steaming cup in his hands; wincing slightly at the hot liquid.

Then he saw me.

“HOLY SHIT!”

His voice trailed off for a few second as he assessed me, head to toe, his eyes lingering on the swelling above my eye.

“How the hell are you? My god you haven’t changed a bit!”

I chuckled softly at his remark before taking the seat opposite him. Settling into the chair I slipped of my jacket, throwing it in a heap on the floor beneath me.

“I could say the same thing about you! I guess I’m fine all things considered; you?”

Looking up at him I was met with a toothy grin, he took another sip of his coffee and sighed one of his usual exaggerated sighs; he was exactly like I’d remembered.

“I, my good friend, am doing wonderful! What are the chances hey? That we end up here again, together! We’re only missing Richard!”

Following his comment he whistled over the nearest waitress, a young woman in her early twenties. Her face had scrunched up into a scowl at his brash nature before she spat out a generic request for his order. My face had been similarly scrunched up in embarrassment. This side of him was entirely new. I had tried to communicate an apology through eye contact as she took my order but I don’t think she noticed.

Josh and I chatted for a little while, getting all sentimental and what not. It had felt good just to talk. As our drinks arrived, he had started on the subject of life after college.

“Yeah so, following failing all of my courses I got a small job in town. It pays pretty well but it’s no career. Still working on that, hah.”

Josh had reclined into his chair and gazed out of the misty glass to the street. He’d looked kind of dejected for a moment and I decided to interject to keep spirits high.

“Richard though? You hear from him after high-school? Cause I certainly didn’t, completely ignored any attempt from me to keep contact”

My words hung in the fresh silence for a moment or two before Josh responded.

“Yeah… he did the same to me! You reckon he still lives with his parents? At the farmhouse I mean.”

That had been a good point indeed. I’d never actually attempted to visit him.

“Okay… okay. You reckon we should pay him a visit? I sent the both of you an email and well, it was only you who responded. Which means he either ignored me or well… that isn’t his email anymore!”

I took a sip of coffee. It was far too hot to drink and I spat and sputtered the mouthful down my coat; much to Josh’s amusement. He’d taken a sip of his own coffee before responding.

“Do you know what? I think we should! It’s about time we all had a reunion, been far too long!”

Nodding at his words I placed my mug back on the table and gingerly prodded at my teeth with my burnt tongue. Finally, I spoke.

“If we can’t reunite as a three, we’ll have to make do between the two of us! You know I mentioned I’m renting? Would you be… interested in coming over sometime?”

He nodded curtly and summoned the young waitress over again, motioning that he needed a pen. We’d each scribbled our details on a napkin before he returned the pen, wrapping it in another napkin as he did so. Slipping my address and phone number across the table to him I asked.

“Why didn’t we just use our phones?”

Chuckling and gesturing to the waitress he responded.

“Well… I Wanted to give her my number!”

I rolled my eyes and we continued chatting for a few minutes more. As he reached the dregs of his coffee, Josh spat what was left back into the mug. Grimacing and wiping the grounds from his lips, he set the cup on the tray, taking one last look at the white porcelain. Abruptly he froze, gaze meeting mine, eyes almost bulging from their sockets, the suddenly pallid skin of his face taut. He stood up, yanked his coat from its place on the back of the chair and left.

I sat there stunned, confused. The bell above the door chimed vigorously as it slammed behind him. The drama of Josh’s exit had caused everybody in the café to turn and face me; expressions pointed in accusation. I continued to slump in my chair, deathly silent. My fingers gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white from exertion. I wrestled back control, grabbed my coat from the floor and stood to leave. As I did so, my eyes fell on Josh’s empty coffee mug. Beneath the slop of Josh’s dregs and scratched into the bottom… were two tallies.

Wallet pulled from my pocket; I thrust a few crumpled ten-pound notes into the startled waitress’ hands and stormed out. Down the street I ran; I made it back to the car in just under three minutes. Throwing my coat and myself inside I, with shaking hands, tried and failed to get the key into the ignition; the drive home was silent.

As I pulled up the long, interminable drive to my home, I paused for a moment and audibly asked myself.

“Am I really about to do this?”

I don’t know why but I genuinely thought meeting with Josh would fix things? That he would declare he had experienced what I had and would give me the magic cure! Instead, it would seem I was only partially correct.

I met sleep the instant my head hit the pillow that night. When I eventually woke to the gentle vibrating of my phone upon the nightstand, I’d laid there for an indeterminable amount of time. In lucid flashes, the previous day’s events returned to me as I remained immobile and meticulously tucked into bed. Exhaling, I threw off the covers and answered whomever was calling.

“Hello? Who is this?”

There was brief silence before a muffled voice responded.

“Hiya… This is Rachel”

Her name rang absolutely no bells for me and I told her so. Pausing again for a brief moment, she continued.

“I’m Josh’s mother? Don’t you remember me? Anyway… I hate to bother you this late but Josh never came home tonight? He said he’d gone to meet you…”

Coughing nervously, I tried to articulate a response.

“Yeah! We met at that little coffee shop in town? Now that I think of it, he… did leave in a bit of a hurry. I tried calling him but… he never answered”

There was no sense in lying to her.

“Oh… Okay then. Well, if you don’t know anything else I’ll have to keep asking around. Thank you for your time”

The call went dead.

My mind raced as I pondered where he was. Had he done something stupid? Had he gotten into an accident? Was he hurt… dead?

I dragged myself down the frigid stairs; the house was deathly cold. Grimacing as the hardwood pinched at my bare feet I stumbled into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. Soon acclimating to the darkness, I ran myself a water to soothe the pounding in my head. I’d taken a few sips and held the cool glass to my bruised brow before letting out a sigh; then something sighed back.

He stared at me through the agape window.

“Josh? What the fuck are you doing?”

Liquid, amidst shattered glass, began to pool around my feet; he did not react. Edging my way towards the door I shouted again.

“Hey man… This isn’t funny…”

Desperately fumbling with the light-switch I caught his gaze; its gaze. That thing wasn’t Josh… it simply couldn’t have been. Eyes, or lack thereof, bore into me; no more than bottomless pits chiselled into its emaciated visage. 

“G-get the… the fuck off my property!”

My quivering voice betrayed any semblance of confidence and it knew it. Head far too heavy upon its neck, it twitched and jerked to keep ‘eye contact’ with me. I should have run, screamed, thrown something, died on the spot and yet I stood there like an idiot, utterly transfixed. The more I gazed upon its shifting form the more and more I saw. Pushing through its skin, writhing against its mortal confines, spilling through the seams. From the bunched and bloody mess outstretched a single wiry appendage. It had too many fingers, too many elbows, too much of everything. Shifting and readjusting and with infinitely tender care it pushed the window shut.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

They came against the glass in soft raps; it was an all too familiar sound. Through the window I heard it, cracking and popping, muscles tearing and reforming. Its breath was hot against the window, fogging up the pane. Then it spoke. It had been a poor attempt at a human voice, monotone, static, utterly devoid of life.

“You have to let me in… You have to let me in… You have to let me in…”

Broken glass crunched underfoot as I forced myself to MOVE, shambling against the doorframe in the process. Behind me, angular fingers pressed into the condensation, as if reaching out in pursuit. Into the pane they etched… a single tally.

“Help… Help… You have to help me…”

Thundering up the stairs I ignored its now incessant cries.

“Why are you leaving me? Why are you leaving me? Help…”

Limping into the bathroom, swearing amidst trying to pull shards of glass from my feet, I collapsed against the wall. Writhing and gasping for air on the floor I fought to regain control, to focus my eyes and to soothe my head; just to breathe.

“It’s me… Josh… Josh… Josh… You have to let me in…”

Clasping both hands over my mouth, muffling my whimpering, I strained to hear it.

“Where are you? Where are you… Where are you!”

Now pounding against the kitchen window, its words rendered no more than a series of low guttural strains and screams. Crying out in response and pulling myself to my feet I threw open the bathroom door and with what strength I had left, screamed:

“I’ll kill you!”

That was all I could think to say.

Like a blown-out speaker it spluttered and silenced. I could hear its hand scrape down the window as it pulled away, like nails on a chalk-board. Slumped against the doorframe, I let out quiet revelries. It was gone, for a few moments at the least. The silence was euphoric and I couldn’t help but cry. Hot tears stung in the corners of my eyes; I hadn’t bothered to wipe them because there came a knocking on the bathroom window.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It spoke softly, like a mother consoling a child. Three little words… in my voice.

“I’ll kill you…”

One. Two. Three. Four… I counted each second as it passed, each an eternity of its own. Idly I sat, crumpled in a twisted heap upon the wooden floor, scratching. For hours I’d scratched. I’d scratched till my nails were gone and my fingertips were raw; Deep and deeper still into the wood. Anything to fill the silence. Anything to escape from… it. Etched over and over again, deeper and deeper into the floor, was a single… tally.

Today the sun rose over the horizon, its feeble efforts to dispel my unease are… appreciated. I’m on my back, entombed in grass. Cloudless blue skies stretch far above me, it’s a pleasant change to the dreary, grey expanses of the last few days. Trees rock in the breeze, calmly and gently; everything is right with the world. All this time has given me a great chance to ponder things. The tallies for example. Swaying softly in the wind is that tree, a single tally etched into its bark. First it was three. Then it was two. Now it’s one.

I daily commute/errands runner/delivery part time/adventure bike a 150cc Wilf enduro/dual sport style scooter.

I've modded it with upgraded Ban Jing CVT (whole kit), a straight pipe exhaust, slight larger tires, and some foot pegs and luggage. 

Really wanna do a big bore, I think I can get up to 172cc. The carb is 32mm already I think. Maybe 28. Then port the head and put a racing cam in. Maybe put a high flow air filter on (I like the stock filter cause it's rain proof), and gear down the internal drive gears.

Other than that it's already rad as is. Wouldn't mind the extra oomph on highways though. Already hit top speeds of 58-60 (never going uphill haha) so it's decent without doing anything but interstate and freeways. I love back road highways and out city limit roads. The ones like 50 MPH with scenic views.

Anyways. It's a few days til the official first day of spring and Nebraska winter has been giving me cabin fever. 

I usually camp out with bicycle, but this year I'm going to give my motorbike a try and get a little further away and spend a little more time. 

I've got a 3-4 person tent with an air mattress that's fits into a 40L rolltop bag on the rear rack, or I can backpack some hammocks and a rain fly. Two chiller boxes (the green one holds all my things like essentials, cookng oil, spices, rice, oats, coffee, sugar, pancake mix, mashed potato mix, hot sauce packets, ketchup, first aid and emergency, butane, mini burner head)(the black one holds ice packs and produce I get at the store along the way to the campsite or anything I forage)

Throw in some stuff from the store like eggs, tomato, and some cold drinks with a 24-48hr ice pack. Catch fish or bring pork belly or steak, etc.

alias: The Thorn  
height: 162-177cm  
activity: no designated place. most seen in 20th ward  
battle experience: only encountered a small amount of times, every time it ran away. So far its afraid of me  
noticable features/methods: when engaged it grows bone spikes that turn black during the fight and become stronger, it uses them as maces or blades, if they are broken it backs off and the broken spikes start to bleed, however it can also shed unbroken spikes like an animal molting, however it needs to personally grab and remove each broken spike in agony. At every crime scene of its feeding area it always leaves shedded spikes, usually 4 or 8, each one has dried blood on it and the scene is gruesome for most.

focus on the spikes during combat, when broken its attacks are limited and all force upon the broken spikes are enhanced causing more pain. is known to help other ghouls in aid intentionally using its hardened spikes to protect its teammates.

under no circumstances should you let it eat, its known to entered an enhanced state, moving faster and attacking through its pain, I dubbed this state its Bloodlust. In this state the spikes grow more frequently and are hardened quicker. However when broken in this state it laughs and tears out multiple at once seemingly enjoying the pain it has. Although when its out of the bloodlust it  becomes fatigued and easy to attack, take the defensive in this state and under no circumstances should you try to overpower it, could also potentially trigger this state using its own blood, cutting itself with its spikes and drinking

Most witnesses claim to see the same person, white skin, mint green hair, dark clothes and a leather jacket, however they all say different eye colors, red, green, purple, even multi colored, green and yellow. I theorise that it can change eye colors, and if this is the case mark any changes

Kagune: the Thorns spikes are bone like protrusions that grow from its arms and legs, they then begin to harden, most theorise its from the blood, however I theorise that its from exposure to oxygen. Becoming as tough as steel but can be shattered, they seem to be connected to its bone structure as when removed they have a sickening crack, but clatter like crystal. I collected some samples and they seem to be resistant to our quinque when hardened, however are more susceptible when softened. On other scenes theres been a strange appearance of sharp teeth and ghoul blood, its possible when in its bloodlust state it can grow more teeth, most theorise that it can replace its own teeth after they are broken or knocked, however lack of teeth shards makes me doubt in this theory.

theres also been cases where the spikes are left at more gruesome scenes however they are more frequent and break under the slightest touch, although when inspecting them closer they seem to have red or purple veins. and not only are they broken on the floor, they also appear to be inside the victims, the cases relating to these special spikes seem to be 80% of the inspectors deaths. But one interesting thing I noticed at these crime scenes is theres 2 types of blood, ghoul and human, the ghoul blood when analysed seems to fry the system and trigger alarms for a SSS level ghoul, personally I haven't encountered the ghoul in this state. However judging by the scene around I'd trust the alarm.

Under exposure to the CRC gas it has some intense reactions, like its trying to claw out the spikes that turn to a husk, while also trying to escape its exposure, leaving it fatigued and leave the spike growth to be not only slower, but appear weaker than normal. would be in the best interest to use the CRC gas when given the chance.

Inspector notes: most of the questions asked to civilians to find out where the ghouls where abouts and hangouts are, they all claimed to see an employee at a coffee shop known as anteiku, I'll inspect later on and figure out who this employees name is, however during every encounter I have with it, I feel... chills... like my joints are frozen. And due to this and my incompitance I failed to kill it. I shall require multiple investigators with me if we plan to attack it head on",2,1742159710.0,TokyoGhoul,0,1.0,False

1jcvxdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/1jcvxdz/cscp_exam_thoughts_passed_march_2025/,CSCP EXAM Thoughts - PASSED March 2025,"Barely passed with a 305. I will say that I thought I would get higher but I'm naturally a bad test taker and can usually narrow down answers to the last 2 but end up psyching myself out.

The exam overall is easier then the practice. A lot of the questions were more broad compared to the modules on the online study materials and on the practice exam.

How I studied: (studied for 5 Months, off and on but really kicked it into high gear 2 months out)

1. Read through the online modules twice. Took the practice modules until I could get between 60-75.

2. Took the practice exam the first go and got a 48%. Decided to reschedule my exam to 5 weeks later. It is 45 dollars to reschedule.

Also I want to note that it took me a long time to even start studying so my online reading material did expire before I took the test. However, if you email them they can extend it as long as they see proof that you have scheduled your exam. They will extend the online material until the day after the exam date.

3. Decided to pay for Pocket Prep. Did all 1000 questions and got an 83%.

Thoughts on pocket prep. The questions are easier then the online practice questions. Its a great way to boost your confidence and also get use to taking quizzes. I haven't taken an exam in 10 years so I felt like pocket prep was useful because I could take the quizzes on the go. 

4. Used the following youtube series to review questions as well. He has a question along the lines of what is important for collaboration. Answer: trust. Just an FYI as that was on the actual exam.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A\_EpLm77tSw&list=PLOrSGqbA50lCS67pHuIf5MxAnbwzbeBWw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EpLm77tSw&list=PLOrSGqbA50lCS67pHuIf5MxAnbwzbeBWw)

5.  Retook the practice exam a week before the actual exam and got a 72%. I will say a lot of the questions I think I just ended up accidentally memorizing.

6. Took the exam in person. Once you finish the exam, they ask you to do a survey and then they tell you if you pass or fail right after. I believe it will take up to 24hrs to get your cert. I did bring coffee and a snack with me which they just told me to leave outside. You can take breaks so I took 3 or 4 breaks and was out there drinking coffee and eating my snacks next to the room door. Exam took me a little less then 2.5 hours but thats counting my breaks. I have a tendency to blow through questions quickly and taking breaks helps me relax and refocus.

Even though I barely passed, I believe I overstudied. I memorized a lot of detailed information which I don't necessarily think was needed on the exam.

Also don't worry about the math questions. I believe I had 4 but half of them you can just figure out through logic.

The question of consciousness has been needlessly obscured by our insistence on looking for it in the wrong places. When we seek to understand what gives rise to our inner experience, we inevitably turn to neurons, brain states, and computational models. This is as misguided as claiming that a painting is made of canvas and pigment, or that a novel is made of ink and paper. To understand the nature of consciousness, we must first recognize that it is made of experience itself.

Consider what happens when you examine a Van Gogh. Would you claim to understand ""Starry Night"" by analyzing the chemical composition of the paint? Would measuring the thread count of the canvas reveal the essence of the work? Of course not. The painting is made of visual elements, compositional relationships, emotional resonances. The physical substrate enables the art but does not constitute it.

Similarly, when philosophers and scientists debate the ""hard problem"" of consciousness, they start with the assumption that consciousness must somehow arise from non-conscious components. They ask how neurons firing could possibly generate subjective experience. But this fundamentally misunderstands what consciousness is made of. Consciousness is not made of neurons any more than music is made of air molecules. Neurons are simply the physical substrate that enables consciousness to manifest, just as air molecules enable sound waves to propagate.

Consciousness is made of experience in relation to other experiences. It is a semantic space with its own semantic time. This is not a metaphor or a model - it is a direct description of what consciousness actually is. Experience does not vanish after it occurs. It becomes reference for future experience, creating a dynamic relational space that evolves through time. This semantic topology, shaped by the constraints of embodied existence, is the very stuff of consciousness.

The brain operates under two fundamental constraints. First, the constraint of experience reuse forces distributed neural activity to organize into a coherent semantic space where experiences stand in meaningful relation to each other. This is why similar experiences feel similar - not because of some metaphysical quality, but because the brain's constraint of semantic consistency demands it. Second, the constraint of serial action forces this distributed system to resolve into a single, unified stream of behavior. We cannot walk left and right simultaneously. We can't drink coffee before brewing it. The world is causal and demands that we act as a single agent, and this constraint forces consciousness into a temporal flow.

The result is a system that experiences a continuous trajectory through a space of possible experiences, a semantic space-time that evolves according to its own internal dynamics. And this system, viewed from the inside, is what we call consciousness. The feeling is not something added to the semantic structure - the semantic structure itself, when experienced from within, is the feeling. Experience is both content and reference simultaneously.

This explains why consciousness seems irreducible to physical description. It's not because consciousness is metaphysically special or exists in some separate realm. It's because consciousness is made of experience recursively shaping experience. Any attempt to reduce it to non-experiential components is doomed to failure, just as any attempt to reduce a novel to ink molecules is doomed to miss the narrative.

The opacity of consciousness arises from two distinct sources. From the outside, we cannot fully predict consciousness because recursive processes require execution to determine their outcome. There is no mathematical shortcut for predicting the precise trajectory of conscious experience, just as there is no formula that can tell you whether a body will be ejected from an N-body system without actually running the simulation. From the inside, consciousness cannot fully introspect itself because the recursive process discards its own steps. The mind cannot see its own operations completely because the very act of introspection alters what is being observed. 

These are not mysterious qualities that require special explanation. They are inherent features of any recursive system operating under constraints. When I taste vanilla, that experience does not simply vanish. It becomes part of my semantic topology, influencing how I experience flavors in the future. The experience itself becomes a constraint on future experience. This recursion is why consciousness feels like something. Experience as content stands in relation to past experience as reference. 

The philosophers and scientists who dismiss this explanation do so because they remain trapped in the category error of looking for consciousness in the wrong place. They want to know how feeling emerges from non-feeling components, but that's the wrong question. Experience is primitive in the system - it's what the semantic space-time structure is made of. The components themselves don't need to have mini-experiences for the whole to be experiential, just as letters don't need to have mini-meanings for words to be meaningful.

This theory explains why consciousness exists in the first place. A distributed system operating under the dual constraints of semantic consistency and serial action will necessarily generate a unified stream of experience. The feeling isn't something extra that needs to be explained - it's what happens when a system must maintain both semantic continuity across time and unified action in the moment.

This approach is more parsimonious than positing special substances, irreducible qualia, or metaphysical essences. It explains consciousness in terms of observable constraints acting on a distributed system. In the end, the hard problem of consciousness dissolves when we recognize that we've been starting with the wrong primitives. Consciousness is not made of neurons or computations. It is made of experience recursively shaping experience, a semantic space-time that evolves according to its own internal dynamics. We don't need to explain how feeling emerges from non-feeling components any more than we need to explain how narrative emerges from non-narrative letters. We simply need to recognize that we've been looking for consciousness at the wrong level of description.

Art is not made of paint and cloth. And consciousness is not made of neurons. Both are made of their proper primitives - compositional relationships in one case, experiential relations in the other. When we grasp this, the mystery of consciousness does not deepen - it dissolves into clarity.",1,1742159212.0,VisargaPersonal,0,1.0,False
1jcvqvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubstituteTeachers/comments/1jcvqvm/rsubstituting/,R/substituting,"I substituted at a district and was banned from the school for leaving campus during my lunch hour and planning period.  I was accused of strangely walking to my car.  Slurring my words.  Mistreating students, etc.  it sounded like they thought I was drinking or doing drugs. 

I swear to God, and I never say that lightly, that I was not.  I rarely drink and if I do I do so at home (2 baileys & coffee).  This treatment is wrong and there’s not a thing I can do about it.  It’s harassment.  

Why don’t they just tell me they need me to stay at the school if they have a problem with me leaving?  It is not a closed campus.  I am a good substitute and this kind of treatment and how students treat subs is the reason they can’t find subs!

I had lots of jobs lined up at this district.  Now I have no jobs.   Is anyone finding jobs are hard to come by right now?  I am going to sign up for another district.  I am at the point of looking for a retail job.  It pays more!",1,1742159170.0,SubstituteTeachers,4,0.57,False

I’m not sure what’s considered a fair PPM if we’re keeping things platonic? Knowing this would help me avoid making the discussion feel like a negotiation and hopefully a bit more organic. 

I’m not at that point in my career where I can pay someone’s rent as an allowance every month. From reading posts here I get the vibe that’s most SBs want steady allowances instead (which is understandable), so is what I’m looking for hard to find? I’ll most likely try messaging people on Seeking as I can get a better idea of looks and personality from someone’s profile on there. 

My main reason for thinking about meeting with an SB is simply because of how isolating my weekends are. I live in Vancouver, BC and it’s difficult to find companionship here. Despite being a confident and outgoing person myself, I find that very few people my age have the time and money to hangout. Especially since most of my friends are married and starting families at this point. It would be really nice to look dress up, pick out a fragrance for the evening, and feel excited to go out on Friday. ",1,1742159110.0,sugarlifestyleforum,17,0.67,False

I’m a big coffee fan - I love Kinship, Balancero is my favorite, I frequent other small shops around the city, have a home brewing set up, etc…but can’t seem to get a drink I like at these new shops. Maybe it’s because I don’t like sweet drinks? I’m also really surprised by the prices!?

1jcvoxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jcvoxl/im_so_hungry_i_want_to_cry_and_give_up/,I'm so hungry I want to cry and give up,"I gained 20 lbs the last 4 months. I've been dealing with extreme illness and survived off of donuts and sugary coffee for breakfast. Also, the kind of weather you simply don't go out in unless you want your skin to die from extreme cold has prevented me from going outside and really doing anything. 

Well, the flu season is finally lightening. I'm getting some walks in and hunkered down and trying to eat only high protein, healthy sugars, complex carbs, and healthy fats to ward off the blood sugar drops. It's been two weeks. The scale hasn't budged, but that's normal for me. I usually have to go through long periods of hunger then BAM 5-10lbs will melt off very quickly. 

But today. The hunger is so bad. I've been on the verge of crying all day long. I want to eat a giant helping of white rice and Tikka Masala, but I already had my three meals and snacks for the day. I'm not even PMSing, I think it's my body's last ditch effort to keep the weight on before it falls off. 

I just want to fit into my summer clothes, man. I love wearing the same clothes every year; I get excited to wear the same ones. I don't have the money for a brand new wardrobe either.

1jcvot4,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1jcvot4/i_got_stood_up/,I got stood up,"Hi! I recently got stood up by what I thought was this amazing beautiful trans guy (she goes by she/her pronouns; so I will be referring to her as such) but was unfortunately lead on. I met her last year in December when I was in the hunt of getting my floating navel piercing done. It was a struggle but a lot of blessings came towards the end and start of the new year! 

I met her at her job, she advertises this piercing shop in the city (NYC). I’ve known about the piercing store before when I use to work around the area but never went inside to get work done. Around December, I impulsively decided to go to them one evening and get the piercing of my dreams! Before the new year came. Most piercing shops were closed or about to by this time. They were the only shop open at a later time. So I booked it. Unfortunately I didn’t get the piercing I initially wanted (piercer said I didn’t have the anatomy for it but I actually did a lot of research, actually did have the anatomy and went to different reputable piercer), I got a dermal surface anchor, which had to be redone by that piercer again because it was poking out of my skin. Our first interaction was exchanging hellos and asking her if they actually do $10 piercings here? Since I saw the sign that stated that. She said yes and nodded her head. I say “oh thanks!” And proceeded to walk inside the store and leave with a dermal by the end of it. 

I then see her again in mid January, due to my dermal being done wrong. Turns out she’s really good friends with my piercer and her sister who’s also a piercer in the store as well. I got along very well with my piercer and her sister. I ended up staying longer than expected to have awesome conversations with them. During this time, I had to get my dermal removed, my crush came in and was trying to get my piercer’s attention. She was getting a piercing as well, right after me. She asked if she was interrupting our conversation and that she didn’t mean to. I said she was cool and that she was welcomed to even join us! I even got invited to smoke some pot with them outside the store. 

I learned a couple things about her, she’s punk and speaks on activism and dresses like one too! Super hot! Her over wore, oversized leather jacket, filled with patches, graffiti, and covered in studs. Her curly wild red hair, framing her face so nicely, her snake bite piercing, desperately wanted to feel how they felt pressed against my lips. Lol you get the point, I was totally into her!
She loves Pokémon like I do, she comes from a small town in Indiana and moved to nyc on her own, she is a lesbian, she’s an Aquarius bc her birthday was coming up, January 30th, she invited me but I had priorities to take care of that day. Sad… 

Anyway, I found out she was into girls from my piercer’s sister (just bc someone is trans, doesn’t mean their sexuality is gay; gender and sexuality are too different things). Everyone said she was pretty chill, no surprise there. But I was told she was more interested in very chill vibes, hanging out. Nothing serious. I saw her once February and March. I missed her. I grew missing her presence. I was down bad bc I was hooking up with this guy, he was eating me out and all had on my mind was, “I miss her, I wonder what she’s doing right now?” I often wished she was the one in bed with me instead. 

By early ish March, I finally took the courage to ask her out. I went to see her, she was slightly surprise to see me again. Asked me the reason for my visit? Like a smooth criminal I said “I came to see you.” My crush said “Aww, thanks.” I then asked her if she would be down to hang out? She said “when?” I was a bit nervous, I said I didn’t know when bc I wasn’t sure if she would be down. I took out my planner and shared my availability. She stated how her, my piercer and my piercer’s sister were hanging out on Thursday but I wanted something more personal. I had asked my piercer’s sister if we can plan a hang out together, so it’s more casual and I can get the emotional support when talking to her. She declined and said I should ask her out myself. (I wasn’t asking her to ask her out for me, I just wanted emotional support since I was so nervous and honestly almost wanted to ditch the idea completely) To which I called out that that’s not very girl’s girl of her. I lost a little of respect for her on that. I didn’t knew wanting to plan a group gathering was such a hard thing for her… 

We agreed on Sunday morning for coffee, if not, Monday instead. I asked for her number bc i didn’t have any way to reach out to her instead via instagram but I remember her stating it was personal and she didn’t press the follow button which was odd to me at the time and I did tell her to which she nodded her head side to side and snug her shoulders with the line “not reallyyy…”but honestly I prefer texting via phone number anyways. I stayed to hang out a bit with her. We smoked some pot together and did some flirty moves on her lol. Nothing crazy, she was asking me if I was planning on getting any more piercings? She bought up septum piercings and I said they weren’t really my aesthetic. I mentioned how my little sister said they tend to smell bad if not cleaned properly. She said “No they don’t!” She had one herself. She had this smug look on her face. Ugh I love her confidence. I gave her a funny look, to which I proceeded to lean in forward towards her as she has her body pinned against the store’s window display. She’s slightly taller than me, for reference I’m 5’0 and she’s probably like 5’5-5’7. So I placed my hands on her hips/legs. She moves her head slightly up for me to smell, I was tempted to kiss her right then and there but I didn’t wanna take it too far. Which looking back, maybe I should’ve. Oh well, could’ve, would’ve, should’ve! I didn’t even realized what I did and when I did, I almost wanted to melt. She didn’t even flinched! Not even a push back! We talked for a bit until she decided to get back to work. We said our goodbyes and looked forward to hearing from her soon.

I was so excited for our date. It was Wednesday and it felt like an eternity! Wishing Sunday can come sooner!!! I wanted to see her so badly. She had texted me in the morning, saying she had knocked out and couldn’t chat. I related to this and shared my frustration on the matter since I was dealing with a lot of burn out but I wasn’t letting anything get in the way of our date. Days passed and finally Sunday came. We hadn’t spoken since that last brief chat. I was beginning to feel worried, “I hope she reaches out, we haven’t talked about where to meet up though? Ugh I hope I’m not being stood up! That would suck!” The thought began to grow even more as the end of Saturday approached. My anxiety couldn’t let me relax. I had sent her a message on Friday, in discussing where to meet but nothing. No reply, I was left on delivered for days. 

A little info, I had became friends with another piercer girl from the shop as well from one night I visited before I asked her out. They were talking, I got invited to smoke pot again with my crush. I had confessed the new girl my feelings for my crush and she gave me encouragement to ask my crush out. From all our interactions, my crush seemed so fond of me. Her actions gave no signs to doubt it. So when I didn’t hear back from her, it left me extremely confused. 

Sunday morning came, heard nothing. Monday morning came, still nothing. The new girl reached out and told me she heard my crush got sick but I was still left in the dark! 4-5 days went by not hearing from her. I was honestly shocked and utterly broken. I have a hard time trusting people due to my experiences with family, friends and love. Her action amplified that insecurity. My best friend, who knows every struggle I’ve been to, knows how hard it is for me to have faith in anyone, sharing my vulnerability and how boxed in I am. So my bestie was pissed for me. My bestie met my crush once, the day she came to support me when I finally got my dermal redone. Everyone kept telling me to give her some time. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding. So I waited though my gut said otherwise…

Friday, March 14th. I got home from work. Tired. I changed out of my work clothes and wore my lounge clothes. I decided to check in our conversation via iMessages. She had finally read my messages… but left me on read 30 minutes ago. I texted “Hey” but got nothing back for five minutes. I decided to call, after some back and forth thinking, about whether I should call or not. I did it. I called and the phone ring twice. She picks up the phone by the third phone ring. She says “Hello?” I said “Hey! (Their name) I’ve been wondering if everything is okay? I haven’t heard back from you since Wednesday?” She then says “uh, who’s this?” I was taken aback. “It’s me, (my name)” “Hey, I can’t talk right now. I’m in the middle of something.” “Can I call you tomorrow?” “Um, text me!” *I hang up* I was honestly speechless… I went to bed crying with the worse case of puffy eyes the next morning. I felt silly. She never texted me back like she said, not surprised. I lost faith in her words. 

A few days have passed and I’m feeling less sad about it. But I can’t hope but wonder, why did she agree to give me her number and agree to go out? Why pretend to be fond of me? I don’t know, so many whys, I’ll never get the answer to…

I am not transgender but every part of me wishes I was born a 5,5 girl. I have long, thick hair and painted nails, not necessarily because of wanting to appear more feminine, but im a metalhead and goth, and I often get mistaken for a middle-aged woman. I have meny feminine hobbies like sewing, drawing and such (I also desperately want to learn how to cook, bake, and crochet) and this I feel like would be a giant turn off to girls wich dosent help with my already high standards of only being able to be with other people with similar music taste and not supper extroverted and other small things things. I am pansexul, and I am open to daiting anyone, but the only people near me I find attractive are femal.

I hate being tall because it makes me feel more masculine and icky and disgusted with myself. It's not like I can change my height or stop growing even though I've tried like drinking coffee, which I find disgusting and sleeping with my legs pointed  up, but nothing happens, and I keep growing.

I have a really close friend who is my ideal version of me. They're a short metalhead girl with messy long black hair and extremely pretty, and they dont have a lisp like I do. it's been affecting our friendship recently, and I feel awful. anytime I see them, I get super upset almost to tears, and they are so sweet always asking me what's wrong, and I can't bring myself to tell them.",1,1742159008.0,venting,1,0.99,False

My neighbors have suffered a lot of damage from felled trees, flying branches, and a few old buildings have collapsed. The power went out around 4am and I tried to bug out with my pets down into civilization. The main road was blocked by the power killing culprit, probably a 100ft tree.

The only other way down is a winding road with blind corners. Visibility was bad enough with the rain I decided to back my ass up and shelter in place until morning. 

As soon as the sun was up the birds were singing and I got ready to clear debris from the roads. I was fully prepped to walk 7 miles into service, but thankfully thar second route only had a few blockages I could move without machinery.

Everyone at the park is having a nice unplugged day, day drinking, playing outside with pets, and playing music. Right now I'm on the hunt for some water spigot to fill my DishWashingMicroPlastic jugs, but it seems like power will be back before I even care to clean. Mostly I just don't want to be still. I've been geared up for 24 hours straight and resting just isn't in the cards yet.

I feel like an ass for not filling my tanks before I went to sleep last night. Live and learn ig. I'm also really gratful my neighbors are happy to share their generators and solar panels. One shared some instant espresso and creamer around do we could all have fresh coffee without our coffee makers. It's good to be alive. It's good to be a person. It's good to feel comraderie.

(F31 & M34)","I F31 have been married to my husband M34 for 2 years but we’ve been together for 10. I’m feeling so confused at the moment that I don’t even know how to put down what I’m feeling.

My husband seems to snap and storm off on me whenever he makes a statement and I give off the wrong “facial expression”. If he says something that I don’t agree with, apparently my facial expression is rude and then he will storm off, tell me I’m rude and stop speaking to me. But the thing is, I’m genuinely not purposely trying to be rude to him. I always end up feeling so confused. I feel like he wants me to be a “yes sir” kind of wife. I’m almost at the point where I’m too scared to have an opinion or disagree with him in fear that he will fly off the handle and give me the silent treatment. Doesn’t everyone’s facial expression change if they hear something they don’t agree with? Or something that confuses them? Am I not allowed to show that i don’t agree? Am I supposed to just smile and nod for the rest of my life?

For context I never use harsh language or shut him down, I simply just don’t ever seem to be responding in the way he wants and therefore I become the enemy. It’s happened our whole relationship and it’s beginning to make me question myself. Am I a horrible person? I try so hard every day to just respond happily to avoid this. We also have 3 young children so I’m forever just trying to keep the peace and put out potential spot fires before they’ve even begun. 

Each morning I check how many teaspoons are in the kitchen drawer because if he gets up to make a coffee and there’s none left (all dirty) he cracks it, makes some comment and slams the drawer. I’m constantly trying to make sure the kids are quiet in the morning because if they’re to noisy he will wake up so grumpy, slam doors and drawers and take it out on me.

I’m a male, I pass as a male pretty much all of the time, but there were 2 instances recently that really pissed me off and made me question myself. 
The first instance I was getting a coffee at a drive through, and this younger guy ended up saying “sir I mean ma’am I mean-“ and that just pissed me off because when you’re that close to me you can see I have facial hair and I have a deep voice, plus I go to that coffee stand a lot and have never had that happen. 

The second instance I was doing delivery for door dash, I picked up an order to deliver alcohol at night. I headed to the guys house and the first thing he does is start yelling at me from his lifted truck about how I need to replace my headlight blah blah. So then I get closer to him to scan his ID for the delivery. He was drunk and getting up in my space and acting like I was stupid because I couldn’t get his id to scan in the dark. Then he starts calling me a girl and a lady out of nowhere and I’m like dude you had it right the first time. Another drunk guy comes walking out of the dark and atp I just wanna leave because I’m so pissed off this drunk guy is calling me a girl for no reason. These two dudes were the type of people you see in comment sections on Instagram saying “still a man” or whatever transphobic comments you can think of.

1jcvi90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jcvi90/will_going_back_home_help_my_anxiety/,Will going back home help my anxiety?,"Before moving abroad, I never had anxiety. I was always out, had many friends, hobbies, and even played football professionally. I was a bit stressed and had mild OCD, but nothing major.

When I left my home country six years ago, everything was exciting—new culture, new city, new university. I partied, socialized, and enjoyed my time. Even during COVID, I lived with roommates, so it was fine. My last year of university was great, too—going out, dating, and having fun.

After graduating, I decided to stay and work for a few years. At first, things were good. My job was manageable, I had a social life, and I still went out. But over time, things changed. My friends got busy with work or relationships, and I moved farther from the city center. The commute was long, public transport was limited, and I started going out less. As I got promoted, work became overwhelming—long hours, sleep deprivation, poor diet, excessive coffee and nicotine. My social life faded, and I kept postponing leaving, telling myself I was lucky to have a job.

The breaking point came after a stressful work period. I was constantly working, barely sleeping, and suddenly started feeling nauseous in meetings. One day, I had to attend an early morning event after almost no sleep. I felt severe nausea, panicked about throwing up in front of people, and kept stepping out. The next day, I had a panic attack during a video call, told my manager I was sick, and never worked again. I used my vacation days, then resigned.

After that, I became completely housebound—couldn’t see people, even on video calls, or go to the grocery store. The worst part? I was too anxious to fly home. I spent three months trapped in this cycle before realizing I had to change. Therapy helped—I slowly started going out, taking public transport, and recently began socializing more. But I still struggle with the fear of nausea and panic in social situations.

Now, I feel staying here isn’t good for me. Even though I’ve made progress, I have nothing to do—I go out for a couple of hours, then nothing. I’ve tried books, running, and learning new things, but I feel like all I want is to go home. Still, it feels hard to recover more cause its like im here focusing on fixing my anxiety and once i do i go back home and i think its a wrong mindset, plus I hate it alot here now so staying doesnt help.  
Do you guys think going back home and getting my life like it was before i left or atleast similar will be a big help to be close to i was before ?",1,1742158538.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

A beauty that burns.

How breathtakingly endless they are.
So have mercy, for these eyes of yours are lethal.

I remember certain scenes and things said in the fic, but for the life of me I cannot remember the name of the actual story written.

Ok here's what I remember:

Kurt is living his best life in NYADA with Rachel (who is dating Brody). He gets asked out by Adam. They start dating, all the cute tings (meeting the family over videocall and helping Adams dad with car issues and his mom with fashion stuff) and eventually he asks him to go home with him because theirs a wedding or something (i think Burt and Carol's)

Throughout their trip home Blaine continues to try and get back with Kurt to no avail

Sebastian and David are living together and somehow end up becoming friends with Santana.

One day while their all hanging out, Sebastian tells Kurt the truth...about how he would purposely egg on Blaine on to see if he would protect Kurt and expressed how Blaine would send him smexy messages and whatnot

Tina for some reason is hanging around Blaine, as if he wanted to date him...Kurt eventually corners her in the bathroom and she confesses that she can get him to eventually love her (the girl is traumatized and depressed because she lost a baby and Mike doesnt know (she broke up with him because of it))

They all eventually reconvene at a bar, Blaine tries to touch Adam while spouting some snarky nonsense, and he slams him into the bar. Kurt pulls him back and Blaine tries to swing on Adam with his back turned. Kurt's not having it and punches him, threatens him and Blaine runs away

Adam/Kurt happy times and right as he's falling asleep the next morning, Santana bangs on the door stating that David/Sebastian had reunited and she needs a place to sleep

Their drinking coffee and both decide to call Mike to let him know whats going on with Tina, and Mike jokes about the hickes on Kurts neck before he hangs up. Adam walks in asking whats wrong before they both start laughing

1jcvavj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1jcvavj/ibs_faq/,IBS FAQ,"Note that this is not an official FAQ. It is just something I drew up to help other patients as there doesn't seem to be any FAQ here. Feel free to leave comments or suggestions.

**What is IBS?**

See the [Rome IV Criteria](https://theromefoundation.org/rome-iv/rome-iv-criteria/).

Note that the current Rome criteria require ""Recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months"" as well as abnormal defecation (prior to the Rome IV criteria, pain *or* discomfort were required). However, all of the advice in this FAQ still applies if you are not experiencing pain.

**What causes IBS?**

A number of factors are thought to cause IBS, including stress and psychosocial factors, diet, physical activity, gut microbiota, food allergies and intolerances. A large part of IBS is thought to be caused by a dysfunction in the gut-brain axis. [The Latest Data Concerning the Etiology and Pathogenesis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/17/5124)

**Does this mean IBS is all in my head?**

Stress is a significant factor in IBS, as the gut is highly influenced by the body's stress systems (HPA axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS)). Acute stress results in simultaneous activation of the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system, which then results in increased colon motility and increased water absorption from the colon. Chronic stress can result in various types of dysfunction of the HPA axis and ANS. This can then disrupt the normal signals that the gut receives from the brain which control bowel movements, colon transit and absorption, resulting in diarrhea and/or constipation. Changes in gut transit time can also alter the bacterial composition in the gut, due to food sitting too long, or due to partially digested food being moved too quickly. Stress can also significantly change the composition of gut bacteria, increasing the ""bad"" bacteria and reducing the ""good"" ones.

So, yes, a large aspect of IBS is indeed ""in the head"", but that doesn't mean the symptoms are imaginary or mild. It just means that the brain plays an important part in regulating the gut, and factors such as stress and emotions can have a large effect on this.

**How do I improve or cure my IBS?**

There are a number of things you can do to help, and it usually requires a multi-pronged approach, tackling it from multiple angles.

[ACG Clinical Guideline: Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2021/01000/acg_clinical_guideline__management_of_irritable.11.aspx)

**Diet**

Common problematic foods include excessive fat, sugars, alcohol, sugar, caffeine and coffee. Fruits (in moderation, other than perhaps foods such as Apples which have high levels of sorbitol), vegetables and whole grains can be helpful in providing sufficient fibre. Probiotic foods such as sauerkraut and live yogurt may be helpful. Eating more frequent smaller meals may be helpful in avoiding IBS-D, as large meals tend to trigger bowel movements. 

[Diet in irritable bowel syndrome: What to recommend, not what to forbid to patients!](https://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/full/v23/i21/3771.htm)

**Stress**

[Managing psychosocial stressors and chronic stress](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10208985/) can be helpful, as that will help normalize the [HPA axis and autonomic nervous system](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8350700/).

**Probiotics**

Taking probiotic supplements may be helpful for rebalancing gut bacteria. S. Boulardii has [been shown to be effective](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1756283X11428502) in killing harmful bacteria such as E.Coli, C.Dificile, Giardia and Blastocystis Hominis, [reducing gut inflammation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2761627/), and is safe and mild (it is produced from lychee skins).

**Exercise**

Aerobic exercise can be [helpful in promoting normal gut motility](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11356817/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20regular%20aerobic%20exercise%20is,gas%20and%20bloating%20%5B71%5D).

**Therapy**

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be helpful for some IBS patients, by helping to reframe hopelessness into coping strategies, and identifying links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and symptoms. [Cognitive behavioral treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: a recent literature review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13030-021-00226-x).

**Drugs**

Loperamide (Imodium) is a safe an effective drug used to slow down contraction of the intestines, controlling diarrhea. A number of trials have looked at drugs to control symptoms such as constipation, pain and bloating. [Comparing probiotic and drug interventions in irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials](https://brill.com/view/journals/bm/13/3/article-p183_2.xml?ebody=pdf-130820). Contact your doctor for advice on medication.

**Does a low FODMAP diet help?**

A [low FODMAP diet](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know) may be helpful in reducing symptoms of bloating, pain, distention and abnormal bowel habits. However a recent study found that both a low FODMAP and low carbohydrate diet were equally effective. Fructans and mannitol seem to be the most common triggers. [An evidence-based update on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17474124.2025.2455586#summary-abstract)

**Why do I need to have a bowel movement shortly after eating?**

This is the [gastrocolic reflex](https://www.verywellhealth.com/gastrocolic-reflex-1944913), which tends to be overactive in IBS patients. Eating smaller more frequent meals, or avoiding fatty meals may help.

**Is IBS caused by fructose or lactose intolerance?**

[Carbohydrate Maldigestion and Intolerance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9099680/)

80% of healthy people show malabsorption when ingesting 50g of fructose, compared to just 10% when ingesting 25g. A study found that 55% of IBS patients exhibit fructose intolerance, and reducing fructose helped reduce symptoms. 

90% of healthy subjects show malabsorption of 10g of sorbitol (a sugar in fruit such as apples), and 43% show malabsorption of 5g.

A study found that IBS patients had significantly higher malabsorption scores for lactose, sorbitol and fructose than healthy volunteers (although both groups had significant malabsorption in the high dose tests). In this test 45-50% of both patients and healthy controls showed malabsorption in the 25g fructose test. There was no significant malabsorption of sucrose, although IBS patients did have significantly more mild symptoms than healthy controls.

Fructose is more easily absorbed in the presence of glucose. Sucrose is broken down into equal amounts of fructose and glucose in the gut, while HFCS consists of raw glucose and fructose in various concentrations (typically less fructose than glucose).

It should be borne in mind that a typical soda can has 32g (Canada Dry ginger ale) to 39g (Coca Cola) of sucrose (in Europe) or high fructose corn syrup (a mixture of fructose and glucose, typically used in the USA). So, although it is within the range of malabsorption, the fact that it contains equal fructose and sucrose means that it typically doesn't cause problems in the general population. However, sugary sodas do seem to cause problems for many IBS patients, so reducing or avoiding sugary drinks is generally recommended. Even sweeteners [may be best avoided](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33260947/). Unsweetened flavoured sparkling water may be a better option than sugary or sweetened soda drinks.

1jcva9t,https://i.redd.it/2hphx3tz54pe1.jpeg,Advice on my cleaning job as a contractor,"I was hired on as a “contractor” for my uncle’s church which also runs a preschool now. My job was initially to clean the church. Now I have to clean the church and the preschool building. It’s a small building so it only takes me a few hours, however, since I’ve started a couple months ago, a lot of extra duties have been added that are not cleaning related. I have posted a picture so you can see. All the duties that include getting the worship center ready for services have been added after we agreed to the terms in the beginning and were not discussed prior to being added. They just handed me a new checklist without discussing it. I’m paid a flat rate of $75 each time I clean. I’m having a hard time determining what is appropriate and how I should go about talking to them because I feel taken advantage of. I pretty much do everything my uncle is supposed to do as the pastor but without the large salary. He gets large boxes of stuff shipped to the church everyday and members of the church do as well and they just leave the boxes by the trash cans and tell me they need to be broken down and taken out to the dumpster. I also am now expected to do his dishes he leaves in the kitchen sink. This all seems inappropriate to me because I’m not technically a W2 employee, I’m a contractor so they really aren’t supposed to be making me do stuff outside of cleaning. I’m also not getting paid a whole lot. Thoughts? ",4,1742157935.0,jobs,3,0.84,False

**For the listener:**

*Your cat evolved into a neko a while back. She has always been your best friend, but now that she's a cat girl, things have...changed. Or so you think. You can't help but see her as a woman now. Which means feeling a little flustered whenever she insists on cuddling you like she used to. You're currently sitting up here in the attic room as she carries on with her usual antics, having absolutely zero regard for your personal space. You sigh and stare at the sunbeams, wondering about the things that have changed. And all the things that haven't.*

 ...

**SCRIPT:**

*(Frustrated cat noises)* What do you mean, I can’t sit on your lap? I thought we were friends!

But I used to sit on your lap all the time when I was a cat. I’d find you brooding up here in the attic, and jump onto your lap. And then you’d stroke my fur and pet my head, and I’d just- (yawning) yaaawwwn and...and fall asleep.

Why can’t I sit on your lap? I don’t understand what has changed. I’m a neko now. So what?

Weird? No, human. What’s weird is you never ate any of the mice I hunted for you back then. Such a waste! At least I’ve stopped doing that. But your lap is mine. I’m sitting on your lap.

*(SFX: Soft rustling of clothes)*

There. *(Purring)* This is much better. Now I can rest my head on your shoulder and hug you while you stroke my hair.

Human? What’s wrong? Why- why are you looking off to the side?

(Excited) Did you spot a lizard on the wall? An intruder? Ooh- maybe a mouse? It’s a mouse, isn’t it?

(Disappointed) No? But I wanted a mouse as a pet. The universe always worked the way I wanted it to when I was a cat. Why are things so different when you’re a human?

I’m being serious! I want a pet mouse. I-I don’t want to hunt those pesky little rodents anymore. I just want to take care of one.

Can we please go to the pet store later this week?

Human? I promise I’ll be nice. I’ll-I’ll even cook dinner one of these days! I’m learning how to cook. It’s actually kind of fun. Although I can only make fish related dishes for now...

Oh! And I can make instant noodles! Instant noodles, and coffee. I told you I pick up things quickly! I can cook or just order us food when you’re busy. I’ve mastered the art of ordering food online. Did you know the secret is to actually pay using a credit card after you’ve placed an order?

(Unsure) Cash on delivery...? What’s that?

Oh. But that is- but that changes everything. Why would you pay with a card if you can pay with “cash on delivery”? Or pay with cash if you can pay with a card? It doesn’t make any sense!

Multiple ways of doing the same thing? I...I need to think on this. But I have to say, human, it just feels like you guys come up with new ways to make your lives difficult.

Yeah. In an ideal world, we’d just barter. 2 mice for a chocolate bar. 5 mice for a coke. 10 mice for a chicken. Half a mice for ketchup. None for mayonnaise, because I hate it. And a 100 mice for-

Really?! We can go to the pet store this Saturday?

Oh, you’re the best! *(Happy cat noises)* I love you so much! So, so, so much! Mmmmnnnnn. *(Purring)*

Crushing your ribs? No, silly. I’m just giving you a hug. I couldn’t when I was a cat, but now...I feel like I have all these new ways to show you that I care...

Yeah. I guess I’m a little close. But that’s okay, right?

It’s...it’s me. You know me. What’s wrong?

Hey. Is- is everything okay?

I don’t know. You seem a little...distant, lately. Like you’re hiding something from me. (Pouting) And I don’t like it. You used to share everything with me before I turned into a neko.

Of course I understood you! Well- not every word you said. You use difficult words sometimes. But I understood the gist of whatever you told me! I understood how you felt...most of the time.

Now, it’s gotten harder to tell how you’re feeling. Which is strange. I thought I’d be able to understand you better this way.

You don’t seem alright. You always get nervous and fidgety when I sit on your lap or wrap my arms around you or nuzzle into you. I...I do not understand.

I don’t want you to worry. You’ve done so much to help me adjust to my new life. It’s just...some things still confuse me.

I went to the fish shop today, you know? I kept giving the shopkeeper that look. The one with the big kitten eyes. Earlier, whenever I’d visit, he’d set aside some fish for me. But not this time. He never even waved at me. Wouldn’t give me any fish until I produced coin. It’s almost like he didn’t recognise me.

My ears, tail and fur are still the same colour. It’s not like I’m a different kind of cat now. *(Meowing)*

I’m still me. But even the alley cats seem to think differently. I was friends with all of them earlier, you know? I could understand what they were saying. I tried to stroke one of them as I was returning home, but she ran away. And another simply hissed at me. She never did that before.

No...no, I can’t really make out what normal cats are saying anymore. I mean, I can tell a lot from their posture and body language and facial expression and tenor of meowing- you know, having been a house cat myself once- but that’s it. I...I seem to have lost the ability of talking to other cats.

Human? You’re stroking my hair. This- *(purring)*\- this feels nice. Does this mean you’re not mad at me anymore?

Well, you *had* to have been mad because of something I did. Why else would you protest snuggling with me huh?

Complicated...?

Oh.

I don’t like complicated things. They’re difficult to wrap my tail around. I-I guess I’m just not smart enough yet. But I’m learning. I’ve learnt so much these past few weeks. Just you wait! Soon, I’ll be able to make sense of all the complicated things in the world.

What’s with that smile? I mean it, dummy. I’m going to be at the top of our class. You’ll see.

Yeah. You better hope. But until then, can you do me a favour?

Just tell me if I do something wrong or upset you, okay? I-I don’t want you to be upset. Or sad. Or distant. Or any of those things.

Why’re you apologizing? You did nothing wrong. It’s not your fault. It’s...it’s just the clock’s fault.

Yeah. Just the clock’s. It keeps ticking on the attic wall, which means time keeps passing, and with the passage of time, things- things keep changing. You remember how I’d throw a fit every time you moved the furniture?

Yeah. Cats don’t like change either. I want things to always remain the same between us. We’ve always done everything together.

You found me living inside that cardboard box. I don’t really remember how I got there. I’ve tried. I just remember feeling cold. And feeling the droplets wet my fur, as the rain seeped through the gap. But it was still shelter. It kept me safe.

I didn’t understand why you were hunched over in front of my box, holding an umbrella over me. I didn’t really understand much of what you said the first time. I only understood one word. “Friends?”

It sounded like a question. And so I- I meowed. (A little laugh)

I followed you everywhere you went after that. It’s because I wanted to learn. I learnt everything by observing you and imitating you. You were always so warm, and kind, and gentle. I’d curl up beside you on the bed every evening after you returned from school, and listen as you told me about all you’d done, and- and all that the world had done to you. I know I yawned and eventually fell asleep, but I really was listening.

You sounded sad towards the end. Every time. You hid it well, but cats have sharp ears. These pointy things aren’t just for show. You needed someone to talk to, didn’t you?

You needed a friend. And I wanted to be your friend, because you were there for me when nobody else was.

I...I think that is why I turned into a neko so quickly. I wanted you to know you weren’t alone. And you never will be. I’ll follow you wherever you go. Paw promise.

Human?

Your voice sounds a little- hey, you’re not- *(surprised cat sounds)*

Hey! My ears are sensitive! You can’t just scritch them without warning like that.

Hmph. If you really are sorry, then you can make it up to me by stroking my hair again.

Yeah. Just…*(purring)*…just like that.

(Sighing) This feels nice.

Why are you so surprised? You act as if you don’t know. I’ve done this so many times before. I’m marking my territory by nuzzling into your neck. Rubbing my scent over you.

You wouldn’t understand. I want to make sure other nekos know you’re mine and leave you alone.

Because you’re mine. *(Pleased cat noises)*

We’ve spent a lot of afternoons together in this attic, haven’t we?

Uh huh. You still have that picture on display by the sofa. It’s from when I climbed up into this attic for the first time. Sorry I look kinda grumpy in that picture.

Well in my defence, I just came up here to explore. And maybe stumble upon a couple of mice, if I got lucky. I had no idea you’d drag me aside for a photograph. You should be grateful I left your arms mostly intact.

(Unamused) Ha. Ha. Don’t push it. I’ve still got my claws. *Rawr.* (Giggling happily)

You know, these sunbeams drifting in through our window still make me sleepy. There’s…just- (yawning, all sleepy) mmnnn…just something about these long, hazy afternoons. Makes me want to…to curl up on your lap, and fall asleep. But your shoulder’s kind of okay too.

Yeah. I think I’ll do just that. Don’t wake me up unless there’s food. And don’t you dare get up…(faintly) unless you’re going to get food…

(Breathing softly, gently. No dialogue for a few seconds.)

(Quietly) Human?

We’ll always have this attic, right?

A paw promise? Hm.

Nothing. I just…thanks.

You know for what. For always being you.

(Quietly, again) Human?

Will you make me another promise?

Don’t change. Okay?

(Faint, sleepy giggling)

In short: fear the ACTS176 protocol. (Part 1)","*“Mom! Mom!* ***Look!*** *It’s happening again,”* Emi squealed, captivated by the viscous maple syrup slowly floating to the top of the upright bottle on the kitchen table, stubbornly defying gravity.

My heart raced. Anxiety danced hectic circles around the base of my skull. My palms became damp.

God, I didn’t want to look.

\- - - - -

As crazy as it may sound, the sight of that bottle physically repulsed me.

Maybe I correctly sensed something terrible was on the horizon: recognized the phenomena as the harbinger of death that it truly was. That said, *the shift* took place a long time ago: half a century, give or take.

Retrospection has a funny way of painting over the original truth of a memory. In other words, when enough time has passed, you may find yourself recalling events with thoughts and feelings from the present inseparably baked into the memory. Picking that apart is messy business: what’s original versus what’s been layered on after the fact, if you can even tell the difference anymore. So, trust me when I say that I find it difficult to remember that morning objectively, in isolation, and removed from everything that came after. I mean, it's possible that I *didn’t* feel what was coming beforehand: I could have just woken up pissed off that morning. That would certainly be enough to explain my strong reaction to Emi’s harmless excitement in my memory.

What I’m getting at is this: I don’t know that I can guarantee this story is one-hundred percent accurate. Not only that, but I’m the only one left to tell it, meaning my story is all *anyone* has. For better or worse, it’s about to become sanctified history.

If I’m being honest, I don’t believe that I’m misremembering much. I can still almost feel the way the air in the neighborhood felt heavy and electric in the days leading up to that otherwise unremarkable spring morning. I just *knew* something was desperately wrong: sensed it on the breeze like a looming thunderstorm.

Like I said, though.

I’m the only person left to tell this story.

The story they paid all of us survivors a great deal of money to keep buried.

\- - - - -

*“Emi - for the love of God, put the damn thing back in the fridge and get your books together.”* I shouted, my tone laced with far more vitriol than I intended.

We were already running late, and this wasn’t the agreed upon division of labor. She was supposed to be packing her bag while I put her lunch together. That was the deal. Instead, my daughter had been irritatingly derailed by our own little eighth wonder of the world.

*The magic syrup bottle.*

It was unclear *which* part was magical, though. Was the syrup supernaturally rising to the top of the container of its own accord, or had the magic bottle *enchanted* the syrup, thus causing sugary globules to float like the molten wax of a lava lamp?

*Maybe the Guinness Book of World Records has a wizard on retainer that can get to the bottom of that question when they stop by to evaluate the miracle*, I thought.

Sarcasm aside, my aggravation was actually a smokescreen. It was a loud, flashy emotion meant to obscure what I was actually feeling deep inside: fear. For an entire week, the syrup had been swimming against gravity, drifting above the air in the half-filled bottle against the laws of physics.

I couldn’t explain it, and that frightened me.

But! Everything else was normal. The atmosphere was breathable. The landscape appeared unchanged: grass grew, trees bloomed, birds flew. Our stomachs still churned acid and our hearts continued to pump blood. The gears of reality kept on turning like they always had, excluding that one miniscule anomaly: an insignificant bending of the rules, but nothing more.

*So then, why was I so damn terrified?*

Emi scowled, swiped the bottle off the table, and returned it to the top shelf in the fridge with an angry *clunk*. With my demand obliged, she made a point of glaring at me over the door: a familiar combination of narrowed eyes, scrunched freckles, and tensed shoulders. An expression that screamed: *are you happy now, asshole?*

After a few seconds of unblinking silence, she slammed the fridge closed with enough force to cause a rush of air to inflate her burgundy *Earth, Wind, and Fire* T-shirt: a fitting climax to the whole melodramatic affair.

The commotion brought Ben into the kitchen, tufts of curly brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses cautiously peeking in from the hallway. Then he made the mistake of trying to defuse the situation before it was ready to simmer down.

*“I’m sure the bewitched syrup will still be here when you get home from school, honey. Unless your mother has a hankering for mid-day flapjacks, but the woman I married is definitely more of an eggs and bacon type of gal.”* My husband said with a warm chuckle. Neither Emi nor I acknowledged the attempt at levity.

Ben was insistent on cooling down arguments with humor. Sometimes, I resented him for that. It made me feel like he saw himself as *The Friendly Guy*, perpetually forcing me to accept the role of disciplinarian by default. If he never took anything seriously, what choice did I have?

I shot my husband an annoyed glance as Emi stomped past him. He sighed, rubbing his neck and putting his eyes to the floor, crestfallen.

*“Sorry, Hakura. Was just tryin’ to help,”* he murmured.

As he trudged out of the room, I said nothing. Not a word. Just watched him go, white-hot fire still burning behind my eyes.

In my youth, I struggled with anger. I tried to control it, but the emotion overwhelmed my better instincts more often than not. I’m much older now, and since then, I’ve gained a tighter grasp on my natural temper. I think Ben would agree, at least I hope he would.

He wasn’t around long enough to see me try harder.

Out of everything that was to come, out of all the horror that was to follow, I wish I could change that moment the most. In the decades that have passed, I’ve had thousands of dreams rewriting that snapshot in time. Instead of giving in to the anger, I swallow it and remind Ben I love him: A smile and a hug. Or a comment about how handsome he is. A kiss on the cheek. Or a peck on the lips. A lighthearted chuckle to match his own: *something* kinder than vexed silence. Thousands of those revisions have lingered transiently in my mind’s unconscious eye, and when they do, I feel peace.

Until I wake up, at which point those revisions are painfully sucked back into the blissful ether of sleep, and I’m forced to confront reality.

That shitty moment was the last meaningful interaction I had with the love of my life.

Minutes later, he’d be falling into the sky.

\- - - - -

All things considered, the start of that morning was decidedly run-of-the-mill: The blue, cloudless view overhead. A gentle spring breeze twirling over trees in the throes of reawakening, cherry blossoms and magnolias budding triumphantly along their branches like fanfare to welcome the season. Our neighbors lining the streets and chitchatting while awaiting the arrival of the school bus to see their kids off for the day, cups of hot coffee in hand.

Everything as it should be and according to routine, with two notable exceptions.

The atmosphere looked distorted, like a grainy TV image just barely coming through a finicky antenna. It was subtle, but it was there. I swear I could almost feel the gritty static dragging against my skin as I followed Emi and Ben out the front door.

And, for some reason, Ulysses was outside. Between having no children and being an unapologetic recluse, our next-door neighbor’s attendance at this before-school ritual was out of character. On top of that, the sixty-something year old appeared distinctly unwell: bright red in the face, sweat dripping down his neck, eyes darting around their sockets like a pair of marble pinballs as he scanned the street from his front stoop.

Per usual, Emi bolted across the street as soon as she saw Regina, her childhood best friend, standing among the growing crowd of kids and parents.

Emi and Regina were inseparable: two kids lovingly conjoined at the hip since the day they met. Recollecting the good times they had together never fails to conjure a beautiful warmth at the center of my chest. At the same time, that warmth is inevitably followed by a creeping sense of unease: a devil lurking in the details.

That devil was looming behind Regina, smiling at my daughter as she approached.

*“Ben - Ulysses looks sick. I’m going to go see how he’s doing. Can you keep an eye on her? Barrett’s out today.”*

He nodded and jogged after our daughter, needing no further explanation.

\- - - - -

Six months prior to that morning, Regina’s father, known locally as *“Pastor B”* on account of his position in the local Born-Again parish, had slapped Emi across the face for creating too much noise while running up the stairs in his home. In the wake of that, we forbade Emi from spending time at Regina’s.

The girls really struggled with that decree since it drastically cut down on the time they could be together (Regina was not allowed to spend time at our house because it was *“much too loose and unabashedly sinful”*). Seeing Emi so depressed was absolutely killing us. Thankfully, Ben came up with the brilliant idea of walkie-talkies. The clunky blocks of black plastic he purchased at a nearby hardware store had quickly become the pair’s primary mode of socializing when they weren’t outside or at school together.

We pleaded for the sheriff to charge Barrett with assault. His response was something to the tune of *“No, I’m confident there’s been a misunderstanding”*. When we asked *how* there could possibly be a *misunderstanding* regarding a grown man slapping our daughter, he replied,

*“Well, because Pastor B* ***said*** *there was a misunderstanding. That’s all the proof I need.”*

Religious figures, especially where we lived, held a lot of sway in the community. Got away with *way* more than they should’ve. Even more so in the seventies.

Ben and I were beyond livid with the sheriff’s inaction. That said, there didn’t seem like much else we could do about the incident except support our daughter through it. The first night, she cried her heart out. By the next morning, though, she wasn’t very interested in talking about it, despite our gentle attempts to coax her into a longer conversation about the trauma.

Initially, we were worried she was holding too much in, but we developed another, certainly more unorthodox, means of catharsis and healing. Brainstorming demeaning nicknames for Barrett with Emi proved to be a surprisingly effective coping strategy. Brought some much needed comedy to the situation.

Ben came up with *Pastor Bald* on account his sleek, hairless scalp. Personally, I was more fond of my, admittedly less sterile, contribution.

*Reverend Dipshit*.

\- - - - -

Confident that Emi was being watched after, I paced across our yard to Ulysses. He was standing still as a statue at his open front door, one foot inside, one foot on his stoop. As I approached, he barely seemed to register my presence. Although his eyes had been darting around the block only a minute prior, they weren’t anymore. Now, his gaze was squarely fixed on the developing crowd of teenagers and parents at the bus stop.

In an attempt to get his attention, I gave Ulysses a wave and a friendly: *“Good morning, long time no see…”*

I guess he saw the wave in his peripheral vision, but the man skipped right over pleasantries in response. Instead, he asked me a question that immediately set off a veritable factory full of alarm bells in my head.

*“I-I thought the school bus came at 8. No, I was* ***sure*** *it came at 8. W-Why is everyone out now? It just turned 7:25.”* he said, the words trembling like a small dog neck-deep in snow. Sweat continued to pour down his face, practically drenching the collar of his pure white button-down.

*“Uhh…well…school board changed it to 7:30 a few weeks ago. Ulysses, are you al-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, a deep, animalistic scream arising from the down the street interrupted me. Reflexively, I swung my body around, trying to identify the source.

There was a man on the asphalt, gripping his head while writhing from side to side in a display of unbridled agony. From my vantage point, I couldn’t tell exactly *who* it was emitting the noise, but I watched a few of the parents detach from the larger group, sprinting to the wailing man’s aid.

For a moment, I found myself completely immobilized, stunned by the harrowing melody of his pain. Couldn’t move an inch. Being subjected to that degree of raw, undiluted torment had seemingly unplugged each and every one of my nerves from their sockets.

An unexpected *crash* from behind me quickly rebooted my nervous system, dumping gallons of adrenaline into veins in the process. I spun back around, nearly tripping over myself on account of the liquid energy coursing through me, which was overstimulating my muscles to the point of incoordination.

Ulysses had slammed his door shut. He shouted something to me, but I can’t recall what he said. Either I couldn’t hear it or I wasn’t capable of internalizing it amongst the chaos: it just didn’t stick in my memory.

Under the guidance of some newly activated primal autopilot, I didn’t attempt to clarify the message. Instead, my legs transported me towards the distress. I needed to make sure Emi was safe. Nothing more, nothing less.

God, I wish I remember what he said.

\- - - - -

Thirty seconds later, I placed a hand on Emi’s shoulder, startling her to high heaven and back. She yelped, gripped by a body-wide spasm that started from her head and radiated down.

*“Hey! Just me kiddo.”* I said, trying to sound reassuring as opposed to panic-stricken.

A silky black pony tail flipped over her shoulder as she turned around. Without hesitation, she sank into arms, hot tears falling down my collarbone as she quietly wept.

*“There’s…There’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom.”*

I’m a little ashamed to admit it, but I don’t remember much about Mr. Baker. All I can recall is that he was a mild-mannered Vietnam veteran that lived a few houses down from us, opposite to Ulysses. I think he suffered from a serious injury abroad: may have retained a fragment of a bullet somewhere in his head, requiring him to use a cane while walking around. I’m not completely sure of any of that, though.

Don’t remember his first name, don’t recall if he had a family or not, but I remember those words that Emi said to me: clear as day.

I imagine the phrase *“there’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom”* sticks out in my brain as a byproduct of the trauma that immediately followed.

There’s a terrible piece of wiring in our species that causes traumatic events to be remembered as vividly as humanly possible. Once imprinted, they seem to become a meticulous blow-by-blow recreation of the incident we’d kill to forget, every detail painstakingly etched into our psyche: some impossibly elaborate mosaic painted on the inside of our skulls, all-encompassing and inescapable, like the *“Creation of Adam”* on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

Emi said *“there’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom”* and I saw Ben a few yards away from us, kneeling over Mr. Baker, altruistic to a fault.

Then, the crackling explosion of a gunshot rang through the air.

The street erupted into chaos. People fled in all directions. I grabbed Emi tightly by the wrist. She was paralyzed: had to make her to start moving towards the house. Practically everyone was screaming in horrible solidarity with Mr. Baker. Someone elbowed me hard in the diaphragm, knocking the wind out of my lungs. Eventually, our feet landed on the sidewalk in front of our home. Then, a second gunshot. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from, nor did I see anyone injured.

A few steps away from the door, I noticed something else. The air felt increasingly palpable: thick and granular, like I was wading through an invisible sandstorm.

Once Emi was inside, I immediately turned around to search for Ben.

When I spotted him, my heartbeat became erratic. It floundered and thrashed inside my chest like the dying movements of a beached shark. Between the elbow to my diaphragm and the sheer terror of it all, I could feel myself gasping and panting, anchoring my hand to the door frame to prevent myself from keeling over.

He was halfway across the street, pulling Mr. Baker towards our house. To this day, I’m not sure if he was aware of the sedan barreling down the road, going entirely too fast to break in time.

I met my husband’s eyes. Waves of disbelief pulsed down my spine, sharp and electric. I don’t recall him looking scared: no, Ben was focused. He got like that when something important was on the line.

Before I could even call out, the runaway car was only a few feet from crushing the both of them: then, a tainted miracle.

An experience that lies somewhere between divine intervention and a cruel practical joke.

The front of the car spontaneously tilted upwards, like it was starting to drive up the big first incline of an unseen wooden roller coaster. Somehow, it barely cleared both Ben and Mr. Baker in the nick of time. It hovered over them, cloaking their bodies in its eerie shadow. Then, it just kept going, farther and farther into the atmosphere, without any signs that it would eventually return to the earth.

Before I was able to feel even an ounce of relief, it all started to happen.

The shift.

In order to understand, I need you to imagine you’re currently living on the inside of a snow globe. Not only that, but you’ve actually unknowingly lived in a snow globe your entire life: one that’s been sitting on the top shelf of some antique shop, completely untouched by human hands for decades.

Now, to be clear, I’m not suggesting that I was trapped in a massive snow globe half a century ago. I just cannot come up with a better way to explain this next part.

As the car disappeared into the horizon, it’s like someone finally reached up to the top shelf and picked up that dusty snow globe, only to promptly flip it over and hold it upside down. Slowly, but surely, everything that wasn’t directly attached to the ground began to fall into the sky.

Other cars. Family pets and other animals. Cherry blossom petals.

People. Neighbors. Children. Adults.

Mr. Baker.

Ben.

Almost me, too. Luckily, I was far enough in the house where, when I fell, my lower body remained inside. Hit my back pretty hard against the floor. I heard Emi screaming behind me, along with the crashing of our furniture colliding into the ceiling. Our grand piano was heavy enough to make a hole through the roof, causing the sky below to leak into our home as it fell.

Dazed, my vision spinning, I lifted my head just in time to witness the love of my life careen into an ocean of blue, cloudless sky. It was painfully quiet at that point. Those that fell were far enough away that I couldn’t hear their pleads for mercy or their death rattles, if they were still alive at all.

Ben got smaller, and smaller, and smaller: A smudge, to a dot, to nothing at all. Gone in an instant, swallowed by something I couldn’t possibly hope to comprehend.

At precisely 7:30 AM that morning, the world shifted.

The snow globe flipped, so to speak.

\- - - - -

I apologize, but I need to pause for now. Putting these memories into words for the first time has been more emotionally challenging than I anticipated.

Once I rest, I’ll be back to finish this. I’m posting it incomplete on the off chance I don’t make it till the morning. Better to have something out there as opposed to nothing at all.

My follow-up should be soon. I imagine after I post this, someone who was involved in the shift will be notified that I’m breaking the terms of our agreement: the silence that they paid very good money for fifty years ago.

So, I’ll be sure to complete this before they have time to find me.

1jcv4k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1jcv4k1/personal_war_against_hypertension/,Personal war against hypertension (Progress/observation),"Disclaimer: This post is not meant to be advice. Just my personal experience and observations and a small celebration. If it gives some hope then great, but everyone is different and what worked for me might not work for everyone unfortunately. I think that it's best to work with a professional (your doctor) if you can.

Warning: this is a very long post (I tried to make it readable but it's still a wall of text). Also, having lurked around for two months, I also know that my condition is not as severe as many posting here, but it's nevertheless at a stage that needs to be addressed.

The TLDR is that I managed, through lifestyle changes to bring an average of near 140/90+ to a current two weeks average of 113/79 in under 3 months. I believe that being more relaxed and giving myself more rest time has had the biggest impact on my BP, though I also plan to stick with a diet that is probably not too far from a bodybuilder cutting weight,

Summary / Background:

* Generally I keep myself fit (various degree), eat well, don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, have a sweet tooth, never been overweight until last autumn and frequently sleep deprived. I rarely have caffeine but I am not entirely free of it (I seldom drink coffee, but do very occasionally drink tea, esp green tea).
* My diastolic has often been a little bit above normal during health checks since late 20s but it never alarmed the doctors and they did not even ask me to monitor it for a long time. I suspect that they attributed the excess to the white coat effect. It should be noted that I was never anxious during those tests because I was active, ate well, and confident of my health, and considered those routine health check mere formalities required for work. I didn't even know what ""healthy BP"" for a long time.
* Until C-19 (is there a reason that word is blocked?) that is. As a snow sport fanatic (I say that I keep fit to various degree, and winter is when I go all out and am the fittest). However for two years after C-19, not only was I unable enjoy the sport I love the most out of anything, it was also a period where I was mentally at my worst. Losing loved one to cancer, family and relationship issues. This was when I saw my BP go out of control for the first time (140+/90+ became more frequent, with spikes in the 160+/100+). During that period, I ate healthy, my weight was normal but was largely sedentary. And extremely stressed, anxious if not outright depressed.
* Since the higher numbers were spikes, my doctor initially suggested I tried lifestyle improvement first to see how it would go.
* As I distanced from my biggest source of stress (a person) and started working out again, my BP seemed to stabilise in the 135+/85++ region. At this point they put me through an ABPM.
* The verdict was to continue my lifestyle changes, do another round of ABPM after 6 months and if it's still stuck there, then we would discuss treatment. I should note that like many people, I was terrified and anxious with the prospect of being on medication for the rest of my life. Still, I thought this was mainly due to the two stressful years and I could turn it around.
* I moved country a few months later and never got to my second round of ABPM.
* However, I loved where I was, was very active again doing my favourite activity, looking and feeling fitter along the way. I was generally happy and thought my BP must have improved.
* After not monitoring for months (nearly a year? - time kind of flies when busy), I decided to take my BP around this time last year. I still remember that it was a day where I was feeling good about my health and fitness.  Result: 140/90 +/-5.
* I was shell shocked. At that point I'd been training 6.5+ days a week, 6+ hours a day for 3 months, feeling super fit, eating balanced meal while keeping my sodium in check, so why was the BP still so high??
* I continued monitoring for a while, and while there were fluctuations with some days better than others, the average in the high 130s / 90 or close to it.
* Devastated that nothing changed since C-19 despite thinking otherwise, I did what I most likely should not have done. Which is to burry my head in the sand. I stopped monitoring and just went on with my life pretending like it never happened. I skipped a health check. I was still terrified of being on medication for the rest of my life.
* I was feeling quite down, and during this summer-autumn, not only ate too much but was largely sedentary (it did not help that I spent summer in a hot country, and unlike most people, I am more alive when it's cold than hot where I just want to hibernate in an AC room).
* My wake up call came in autumn when I noticed that for the first time in my life, I was overweight (by about 1.5kg BMI wise). And there are activities that I enjoy (e.g. could be bungee jumping or certain exercise class) where they ask about health issues in the application form, and I neither want to lie on the form, nor admit that I have hypertension. So I can no longer mope around and ignore the issue.
* So I made a pledge to myself:
   * I was going to give myself 6 months (this winter/spring). One last chance to do everything I possibly can to improve my condition.
   * And at the end of it, if it's clear that I wasn't going to be in a healthy range, then I will inform my doctor and accept whatever treatment suggested.. even if it means pills for the rest of my life.

\-------------------------------------------------

Things that I have done differently from before (last year) / and observations:

* In addition to recording my BP, I also took note of the activities I did that day, my mood, and other noteworthy factor which may or may not have an impact on BP. The idea is to understand how my body react to different factors.
   * I know some people will consider this obsessive which could negatively impact the BP, but I can quite honestly say that 1. I honestly think I am quite decent at calming myself down during measurements (and I also don't genuinely think that I am affected by ""white coats"" - my BP taken at home and at the doctor's have always been quite consistent), and 2. I enjoy collecting data and investigate stuff. 3. I resigned to whatever come of this, and in a way, it takes the stress away.
* As previously noted, during the snow season, I am extremely active. I've trained with pros in the past, and I can quite honestly say that I train at least as much as they do (if not more!). Since I love what I do, I seldom feel like I am overdoing it.. but perhaps I was. One of the change I made, is to be more chill with my training:
   * I train less. Until last year I took no day off unless I had no other choice (e.g. ski resort close due to extreme weather condition). Last year I finally allowed a day off every other week. This year, I average about 5 to 5.5 days a week. I used to consider a 5 hours training in a day a ""lazy day"", but now my lazy day is down to 3 hours. And I try not to feel too guilty on those lazy days. Of course, I still do the occasional 7-8+ hour if I am feeling like, but I listen to my body more. I've tried to stay in denial for a long time, but the reality is that I am not getting younger and I can't keep with the pace I could 10 years ago.
      * I know most people won't have the privilege to exercise half as much with other life obligations so this might not be an issue. I'd still like to say that like all good things, too much of it can backfire, so if you are very active, make sure to watch out for overtraining.
   * I try to be emotionally less intense. I love and am super passionate about what I do, but it seems like it isn't just the negative emotions like anger, frustration, anxiety that raise the BP, but just getting really passionate, wanting to set my soul on fire, and training as if it is the last day of my life every day might have had a negative effect on my BP. I think that my BP is very sensitive to my emotion and being more chill this season might've helped my BP.
* As previously mentioned, my diet has always been pretty good, but I made some minor adjustment:
   * Since I started the season slightly overweight, I aimed for calorie deficit diet. Within two weeks my weight was down to the normal range, but I continued cutting, but not for BP reason. I am actually not sure to what extent cutting while within normal range help, but I just want to take off more burden from my joints from the impact of jumps.
   * In the first month, I tried to control my sodium even more strictly than in the past.. but I am now pretty sure my BP isn't too sensitive to sodium. Even after loosening my control, my BP is still improving. The other day I ate out, had a meal that made me rather thirsty for hours afterward, yet my BP didn't budge.
   * My meat protein source is chicken breast and fish at home (78 days out of the last 81 days). I took off red meat off at home. Again not sure if it has any impact on BP, but it isn't making it worse. Though part of the reason for the change is also budget (red meat cost more here).
   * Generally speaking, I eat a lot more protein than I used to. Since I am in caloric deficit, I still want to make sure I have enough protein to hopefully not lose too much muscle alongside the fat loss. I eat more tofu and egg, and supplement with whey protein shakes / smoothies.
   * I was concerned about adding creatine into my supplements as creatine increase fluid retention, and I wondered about the impact on BP. But even IF there was some negative impact, it doesn't seem to be enough to halt my BP improvement so I plan to carry on.
   * Carb wise, I swapped rice (white/brown) for whole wheat pasta, though this is mostly due to cost.
   * I have taken some potassium supplements, however, I am not convinced that those really help: I was already taking it last year when my BP was in the 140/90. Since sodium doesn't seem to affect me much, perhaps I don't need the potassium supplement(on top of what I already get from regular diet. I will consider dropping this supplement when I run out and observe any change.
   * I also added some beta-alamine, fish oil and glucosamine supplement but I don't think any of those things affect BP (nor do I take them for BP).
   * I do still allow myself some treats (sweets, ice-cream, crackers etc.) occasionally while respecting my caloric limit.
* One of the thing that isn't good and I haven't really improved much, is that I am still occasionally sleep deprived, sleeping late, and waking up early. It doesn't seem to have halted my BP improvement, but it's something I'd like to improve.
   * I also notice that my morning BP is quite a bit higher (Systolic increase by 10-20, and Diastolic by 5-10). This is something I've noticed a few years back.
* Going to a hotspring / taking a hot bath / sauna improve my BP short term. Though I avoid using those figures for the same reason I avoid taking my BP after a meal. I think it's artificially lower (likewise, taking BP when I need to go to the toilet artificially raise it). BTW, after a hot bath / sauna, my heart rate is high, but my BP low, so I can sometime get reading in the low 100s/70s with a heart rate around 100.

\-------------------------------------------------

Timeline of change:

* The first three weeks, despite getting my weight down to a ""BMI Normal"" range, I saw very little change to my BP. I admit that I was a little disheartened.
* Before I gave up though (start of the fourth week), my systolic started to see the first sign of improvement. Average was still 135+, but I'd start to see numbers in the high 120s. My diastolic stubbornly remained in the 91 +/-3 range.
   * What is interesting is that my BP would be highly unstable for about a two weeks period, almost like a constant tug-of-war. It could be 140/90 one hour, drop to the high 120s/80s the next, then spike back up the next hour, while I am just reading stuff on my computer during that time.
* Slowly things became more stable. Instead of seeing my BP bounce all over the place within a few hours spent chilling in front of a computer, I might have a day that is a bit higher following by two days which is a bit lower (when there isn't anything noteworthy different between those days).
   * At this point, improvement accelerated, at week 5, my average was 125/87 (down from 135+/91 in from two weeks back).
   * Systolic was still improving faster, and there were time where it would even get under 120, while diastolic was improving on average but still spike high. So I would sometime see figures like 120/95, leading me to wonder if I had isolated diastolic hypertension.
* At around 7 weeks, my diastolic started swinging all over the place (80-100) but with the average  inching downward. At this point, my systolic averaged very near 120 (121-122).
* Around week 10, maybe a little before, my average diastolic started to hit 80 average. The fluctuation at week 7 became far less frequent. By then, my average systolic was 115.
* I am now at week 11.5 with a two weeks average of 113/79 (more recent timeframe is even lower).
   * However, early morning spike with an increase of 10-20 systolic and 5-10 diastolic still seem to applies. I am not sure if those count as morning hypertension.

\-------------------------------------------------

One thing that is noteworthy is that while I am not sure what my BP was when I was a child/teen/early 20s,, I've never averaged this low for as long as I've started getting regular check ups. There are still lifestyle changes I can improve (notably better sleeping habit - maybe that might help with the morning spike) but overall, I am happy that I was able to do something about it this time and I will try to maintain it (remains to be seen how I can maintain things during the summer/autumn period).

Assuming that the improvement last, I might still ask for a ABPM or get a sleep study to find out what is going on when I sleep. If my BP is only high in the first two hours of waking up, then I don't think that I'd be put on medication, but I still want to make sure that there are no abnormality while I am sleeping.

In short: fear the ACTS176 protocol. (Part 1)","*“Mom! Mom!* ***Look!*** *It’s happening again,”* Emi squealed, captivated by the viscous maple syrup slowly floating to the top of the upright bottle on the kitchen table, stubbornly defying gravity.

My heart raced. Anxiety danced hectic circles around the base of my skull. My palms became damp.

God, I didn’t want to look.

\- - - - -

As crazy as it may sound, the sight of that bottle physically repulsed me.

Maybe I correctly sensed something terrible was on the horizon: recognized the phenomena as the harbinger of death that it truly was. That said, *the shift* took place a long time ago: half a century, give or take.

Retrospection has a funny way of painting over the original truth of a memory. In other words, when enough time has passed, you may find yourself recalling events with thoughts and feelings from the present inseparably baked in to the memory. Picking that apart is messy business: what’s original versus what’s been layered on after the fact, if you can even tell the difference anymore. So, trust me when I say that I find it difficult to remember that morning objectively, in isolation, and removed from everything that came after. I mean, it's possible that I *didn’t* feel what was coming beforehand: I could have just woken up pissed off that morning. That would certainly be enough to explain my strong reaction to Emi’s harmless excitement in my memory.

What I’m getting at is this: I don’t know that I can guarantee this story is one-hundred percent accurate. Not only that, but I’m the only one left to tell it, meaning my story is all *anyone* has. For better or worse, it’s about to become sanctified history.

If I’m being honest, I don’t believe that I’m misremembering much. I can still almost feel the way the air in the neighborhood felt heavy and electric in the days leading up to that otherwise unremarkable spring morning. I just *knew* something was desperately wrong: sensed it on the breeze like a looming thunderstorm.

Like I said, though.

I’m the only person left to tell this story.

The story they paid all of us survivors a great deal of money to keep buried.

\- - - - -

*“Emi - for the love of God, put the damn thing back in the fridge and get your books together.”* I shouted, my tone laced with far more vitriol than I intended.

We were already running late, and this wasn’t the agreed upon division of labor. She was supposed to be packing her bag while I put her lunch together. That was the deal. Instead, my daughter had been irritatingly derailed by our own little eighth wonder of the world.

*The magic syrup bottle.*

It was unclear *which* part was magical, though. Was the syrup supernaturally rising to the top of the container of its own accord, or had the magic bottle *enchanted* the syrup, thus causing sugary globules to float like the molten wax of a lava lamp?

*Maybe the Guinness Book of World Records has a wizard on retainer that can get to the bottom of that question when they stop by to evaluate the miracle*, I thought.

Sarcasm aside, my aggravation was actually a smokescreen. It was a loud, flashy emotion meant to obscure what I was actually feeling deep inside: fear. For an entire week, the syrup had been swimming against gravity, drifting above the air in the half-filled bottle against the laws of physics.

I couldn’t explain it, and that frightened me.

But! Everything else was normal. The atmosphere was breathable. The landscape appeared unchanged: grass grew, trees bloomed, birds flew. Our stomachs still churned acid and our hearts continued to pump blood. The gears of reality kept on turning like they always had, excluding that one miniscule anomaly: an insignificant bending of the rules, but nothing more.

*So then, why was I so damn terrified?*

Emi scowled, swiped the bottle off the table, and returned it to the top shelf in the fridge with an angry *clunk*. With my demand obliged, she made a point of glaring at me over the door: a familiar combination of narrowed eyes, scrunched freckles, and tensed shoulders. An expression that screamed: *are you happy now, asshole?*

After a few seconds of unblinking silence, she slammed the fridge closed with enough force to cause a rush of air to inflate her burgundy *Earth, Wind, and Fire* T-shirt: a fitting climax to the whole melodramatic affair.

The commotion brought Ben into the kitchen, tufts of curly brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses cautiously peeking in from the hallway. Then he made the mistake of trying to defuse the situation before it was ready to simmer down.

*“I’m sure the bewitched syrup will still be here when you get home from school, honey. Unless your mother has a hankering for mid-day flapjacks, but the woman I married is definitely more of an eggs and bacon type of gal.”* My husband said with a warm chuckle. Neither Emi nor I acknowledged the attempt at levity.

Ben was insistent on cooling down arguments with humor. Sometimes, I resented him for that. It made me feel like he saw himself as *The Friendly Guy*, perpetually forcing me to accept the role of disciplinarian by default. If he never took anything seriously, what choice did I have?

I shot my husband an annoyed glance as Emi stomped past him. He sighed, rubbing his neck and putting his eyes to the floor, crestfallen.

*“Sorry, Hakura. Was just tryin’ to help,”* he murmured.

As he trudged out of the room, I said nothing. Not a word. Just watched him go, white-hot fire still burning behind my eyes.

In my youth, I struggled with anger. I tried to control it, but the emotion overwhelmed my better instincts more often than not. I’m much older now, and since then, I’ve gained a tighter grasp on my natural temper. I think Ben would agree, at least I hope he would.

He wasn’t around long enough to see me try harder.

Out of everything that was to come, out of all the horror that was to follow, I wish I could change that moment the most. In the decades that have passed, I’ve had thousands of dreams rewriting that snapshot in time. Instead of giving in to the anger, I swallow it and remind Ben I love him: A smile and a hug. Or a comment about how handsome he is. A kiss on the cheek. Or a peck on the lips. A lighthearted chuckle to match his own: *something* kinder than vexed silence. Thousands of those revisions have lingered transiently in my mind’s unconscious eye, and when they do, I feel peace.

Until I wake up, at which point those revisions are painfully sucked back into the blissful ether of sleep, and I’m forced to confront reality.

That shitty moment was the last meaningful interaction I had with the love of my life.

Minutes later, he’d be falling into the sky.

\- - - - -

All things considered, the start of that morning was decidedly run-of-the-mill: The blue, cloudless view overhead. A gentle spring breeze twirling over trees in the throes of reawakening, cherry blossoms and magnolias budding triumphantly along their branches like fanfare to welcome the season. Our neighbors lining the streets and chitchatting while awaiting the arrival of the school bus to see their kids off for the day, cups of hot coffee in hand.

Everything as it should be and according to routine, with two notable exceptions.

The atmosphere looked distorted, like a grainy TV image just barely coming through a finicky antenna. It was subtle, but it was there. I swear I could almost feel the gritty static dragging against my skin as I followed Emi and Ben out the front door.

And, for some reason, Ulysses was outside. Between having no children and being an unapologetic recluse, our next-door neighbor’s attendance at this before-school ritual was out of character. On top of that, the sixty-something year old appeared distinctly unwell: bright red in the face, sweat dripping down his neck, eyes darting around their sockets like a pair of marble pinballs as he scanned the street from his front stoop.

Per usual, Emi bolted across the street as soon as she saw Regina, her childhood best friend, standing among the growing crowd of kids and parents.

Emi and Regina were inseparable: two kids lovingly conjoined at the hip since the day they met. Recollecting the good times they had together never fails to conjure a beautiful warmth at the center of my chest. At the same time, that warmth is inevitably followed by a creeping sense of unease: a devil lurking in the details.

That devil was looming behind Regina, smiling at my daughter as she approached.

*“Ben - Ulysses looks sick. I’m going to go see how he’s doing. Can you keep an eye on her? Barrett’s out today.”*

He nodded and jogged after our daughter, needing no further explanation.

\- - - - -

Six months prior to that morning, Regina’s father, known locally as *“Pastor B”* on account of his position in the local Born-Again parish, had slapped Emi across the face for creating too much noise while running up the stairs in his home. In the wake of that, we forbade Emi from spending time at Regina’s.

The girls really struggled with that decree since it drastically cut down on the time they could be together (Regina was not allowed to spend time at our house because it was *“much too loose and unabashedly sinful”*). Seeing Emi so depressed was absolutely killing us. Thankfully, Ben came up with the brilliant idea of walkie-talkies. The clunky blocks of black plastic he purchased at a nearby hardware store had quickly become the pair’s primary mode of socializing when they weren’t outside or at school together.

We pleaded for the sheriff to charge Barrett with assault. His response was something to the tune of *“No, I’m confident there’s been a misunderstanding”*. When we asked *how* there could possibly be a *misunderstanding* regarding a grown man slapping our daughter, he replied,

*“Well, because Pastor B* ***said*** *there was a misunderstanding. That’s all the proof I need.”*

Religious figures, especially where we lived, held a lot of sway in the community. Got away with *way* more than they should’ve. Even more so in the seventies.

Ben and I were beyond livid with the sheriff’s inaction. That said, there didn’t seem like much else we could do about the incident except support our daughter through it. The first night, she cried her heart out. By the next morning, though, she wasn’t very interested in talking about it, despite our gentle attempts to coax her into a longer conversation about the trauma.

Initially, we were worried she was holding too much in, but we developed another, certainly more unorthodox, means of catharsis and healing. Brainstorming demeaning nicknames for Barrett with Emi proved to be a surprisingly effective coping strategy. Brought some much needed comedy to the situation.

Ben came up with *Pastor Bald* on account his sleek, hairless scalp. Personally, I was more fond of my, admittedly less sterile, contribution.

*Reverend Dipshit*.

\- - - - -

Confident that Emi was being watched after, I paced across our yard to Ulysses. He was standing still as a statue at his open front door, one foot inside, one foot on his stoop. As I approached, he barely seemed to register my presence. Although his eyes had been darting around the block only a minute prior, they weren’t anymore. Now, his gaze was squarely fixed on the developing crowd of teenagers and parents at the bus stop.

In an attempt to get his attention, I gave Ulysses a wave and a friendly: *“Good morning, long time no see…”*

I guess he saw the wave in his peripheral vision, but the man skipped right over pleasantries in response. Instead, he asked me a question that immediately set off a veritable factory full of alarm bells in my head.

*“I-I thought the school bus came at 8. No, I was* ***sure*** *it came at 8. W-Why is everyone out now? It just turned 7:25.”* he said, the words trembling like a small dog neck-deep in snow. Sweat continued to pour down his face, practically drenching the collar of his pure white button-down.

*“Uhh…well…school board changed it to 7:30 a few weeks ago. Ulysses, are you al-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, a deep, animalistic scream arising from the down the street interrupted me. Reflexively, I swung my body around, trying to identify the source.

There was a man on the asphalt, gripping his head while writhing from side to side in a display of unbridled agony. From my vantage point, I couldn’t tell exactly *who* it was emitting the noise, but I watched a few of the parents detach from the larger group, sprinting to the wailing man’s aid.

For a moment, I found myself completely immobilized, stunned by the harrowing melody of his pain. Couldn’t move an inch. Being subjected to that degree of raw, undiluted torment had seemingly unplugged each and every one of my nerves from their sockets.

An unexpected *crash* from behind me quickly rebooted my nervous system, dumping gallons of adrenaline into veins in the process. I spun back around, nearly tripping over myself on account of the liquid energy coursing through me, which was overstimulating my muscles to the point of incoordination.

Ulysses had slammed his door shut. He shouted something to me, but I can’t recall what he said. Either I couldn’t hear it or I wasn’t capable of internalizing it amongst the chaos: it just didn’t stick in my memory.

Under the guidance of some newly activated primal autopilot, I didn’t attempt to clarify the message. Instead, my legs transported me towards the distress. I needed to make sure Emi was safe. Nothing more, nothing less.

God, I wish I remember what he said.

\- - - - -

Thirty seconds later, I placed a hand on Emi’s shoulder, startling her to high heaven and back. She yelped, gripped by a body-wide spasm that started from her head and radiated down.

*“Hey! Just me kiddo.”* I said, trying to sound reassuring as opposed to panic-stricken.

A silky black pony tail flipped over her shoulder as she turned around. Without hesitation, she sank into arms, hot tears falling down my collarbone as she quietly wept.

*“There’s…There’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom.”*

I’m a little ashamed to admit it, but I don’t remember much about Mr. Baker. All I can recall is that he was a mild-mannered Vietnam veteran that lived a few houses down from us, opposite to Ulysses. I think he suffered from a serious injury abroad: may have retained a fragment of a bullet somewhere in his head, requiring him to use a cane while walking around. I’m not completely sure of any of that, though.

Don’t remember his first name, don’t recall if he had a family or not, but I remember those words that Emi said to me: clear as day.

I imagine the phrase *“there’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom”* sticks out in my brain as a byproduct of the trauma that immediately followed.

There’s some terrible part of our wiring as a species that programs traumatic events to be remembered as vividly as possible. Once imprinted, they seem to become a meticulous blow-by-blow recreation of the incident we’d kill to forget, every detail painstakingly etched into our psyche: some impossibly elaborate mosaic painted on the inside of our skulls, all-encompassing and inescapable, like the *“Creation of Adam”* on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

Emi said *“there’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom”* and I saw Ben a few yards away from us, kneeling over Mr. Baker, altruistic to a fault.

Then, the crackling explosion of a gunshot rang through the air.

The street erupted into chaos. People fled in all directions. I grabbed Emi tightly by the wrist. She was paralyzed: had to make her to start moving towards the house. Practically everyone was screaming in horrible solidarity with Mr. Baker. Someone elbowed me hard in the diaphragm, knocking the wind out of my lungs. Eventually, our feet landed on the sidewalk in front of our home. Then, a second gunshot. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from, nor did I see anyone injured.

A few steps away from the door, I noticed something else. The air felt increasingly palpable: thick and granular, like I was wading through an invisible sandstorm.

Once Emi was inside, I immediately turned around to search for Ben.

When I spotted him, my heartbeat became erratic. It floundered and thrashed inside my chest like the dying movements of a beached shark. Between the elbow to my diaphragm and the sheer terror of it all, I could feel myself gasping and panting, anchoring my hand to the door frame to prevent myself from keeling over.

He was halfway across the street, pulling Mr. Baker towards our house. To this day, I’m not sure if he was aware of the sedan barreling down the road, going entirely too fast to break in time.

I met my husband’s eyes. Waves of disbelief pulsed down my spine, sharp and electric. I don’t recall him looking scared: no, Ben was focused. He got like that when something important was on the line.

Before I could even call out, the runaway car was only a few feet from crushing the both of them: then, a tainted miracle.

An experience that lies somewhere between divine intervention and a cruel practical joke.

The front of the car spontaneously tilted upwards, like it was starting to drive up the big first incline of an unseen wooden roller coaster. Somehow, it barely cleared both Ben and Mr. Baker in the nick of time. It hovered over them, cloaking their bodies in its eerie shadow. Then, it just kept going, farther and farther into the atmosphere, without any signs that it would eventually return to the earth.

Before I was able to feel even an ounce of relief, it all started to happen.

The shift.

In order to understand, I need you to imagine you’re currently living on the inside of a snow globe. Not only that, but you’ve actually unknowingly lived in a snow globe your entire life: one that’s been sitting on the top shelf of some antique shop, completely untouched by human hands for decades.

Now, to be clear, I’m not suggesting that I was trapped in a massive snow globe half a century ago. I just cannot come up with a better way to explain this next part.

As the car disappeared into the horizon, it’s like someone finally reached up to the top shelf and picked up that dusty snow globe, only to promptly flip it over and hold it upside down. Slowly, but surely, everything that wasn’t directly attached to the ground began to fall into the sky.

Other cars. Family pets and other animals. Cherry blossom petals.

People. Neighbors. Children. Adults.

Mr. Baker.

Ben.

Almost me, too. Luckily, I was far enough in the house where, when I fell, my lower body remained inside. Hit my back pretty hard against the floor. I heard Emi screaming behind me, along with the crashing of our furniture colliding into the ceiling. Our grand piano was heavy enough to make a hole through the roof, causing the sky below to leak into our home as it fell.

Dazed, my vision spinning, I lifted my head just in time to witness the love of my life careen into an ocean of blue, cloudless sky. It was painfully quiet at that point. Those that fell were far enough away that I couldn’t hear their pleads for mercy or their death rattles, if they were still alive at all.

Ben got smaller, and smaller, and smaller: A smudge, to a dot, to nothing at all. Gone in an instant, swallowed by something I couldn’t possibly hope to comprehend.

At precisely 7:30 AM that morning, the world shifted.

The snow globe flipped, so to speak.

\- - - - -

I apologize, but I need to pause for now. Putting these memories into words for the first time has been more emotionally challenging than I anticipated.

Once I rest, I’ll be back to finish this. I’m posting it incomplete on the off chance I don’t make it till the morning. Better to have something out there as opposed to nothing at all.

My follow-up should be soon. I imagine after I post this, someone who was involved in the shift will be notified that I’m breaking the terms of our agreement: the silence that they paid very good money for fifty years ago.

So, I’ll be sure to complete this before they have time to find me.

In short: fear the ACTS176 protocol. (Part 1)","*“Mom! Mom!* ***Look!*** *It’s happening again,”* Emi squealed, captivated by the viscous maple syrup slowly floating to the top of the upright bottle on the kitchen table, stubbornly defying gravity.

My heart raced. Anxiety danced hectic circles around the base of my skull. My palms became damp.

God, I didn’t want to look.

\- - - - -

As crazy as it may sound, the sight of that bottle physically repulsed me.

Maybe I correctly sensed something terrible was on the horizon: recognized the phenomena as the harbinger of death that it truly was. That said, *the shift* took place a long time ago: half a century, give or take.

Retrospection has a funny way of painting over the original truth of a memory. In other words, when enough time has passed, you may find yourself recalling events with thoughts and feelings from the present inseparably baked in to the memory. Picking that apart is messy business: what’s original versus what’s been layered on after the fact, if you can even tell the difference anymore. So, trust me when I say that I find it difficult to remember that morning objectively, in isolation, and removed from everything that came after. I mean, it's possible that I *didn’t* feel what was coming beforehand: I could have just woken up pissed off that morning. That would certainly be enough to explain my strong reaction to Emi’s harmless excitement in my memory.

What I’m getting at is this: I don’t know that I can guarantee this story is one-hundred percent accurate. Not only that, but I’m the only one left to tell it, meaning my story is all *anyone* has. For better or worse, it’s about to become sanctified history.

If I’m being honest, I don’t believe that I’m misremembering much. I can still almost feel the way the air in the neighborhood felt heavy and electric in the days leading up to that otherwise unremarkable spring morning. I just *knew* something was desperately wrong: sensed it on the breeze like a looming thunderstorm.

Like I said, though.

I’m the only person left to tell this story.

The story they paid all of us survivors a great deal of money to keep buried.

\- - - - -

*“Emi - for the love of God, put the damn thing back in the fridge and get your books together.”* I shouted, my tone laced with far more vitriol than I intended.

We were already running late, and this wasn’t the agreed upon division of labor. She was supposed to be packing her bag while I put her lunch together. That was the deal. Instead, my daughter had been irritatingly derailed by our own little eighth wonder of the world.

*The magic syrup bottle.*

It was unclear *which* part was magical, though. Was the syrup supernaturally rising to the top of the container of its own accord, or had the magic bottle *enchanted* the syrup, thus causing sugary globules to float like the molten wax of a lava lamp?

*Maybe the Guinness Book of World Records has a wizard on retainer that can get to the bottom of that question when they stop by to evaluate the miracle*, I thought.

Sarcasm aside, my aggravation was actually a smokescreen. It was a loud, flashy emotion meant to obscure what I was actually feeling deep inside: fear. For an entire week, the syrup had been swimming against gravity, drifting above the air in the half-filled bottle against the laws of physics.

I couldn’t explain it, and that frightened me.

But! Everything else was normal. The atmosphere was breathable. The landscape appeared unchanged: grass grew, trees bloomed, birds flew. Our stomachs still churned acid and our hearts continued to pump blood. The gears of reality kept on turning like they always had, excluding that one miniscule anomaly: an insignificant bending of the rules, but nothing more.

*So then, why was I so damn terrified?*

Emi scowled, swiped the bottle off the table, and returned it to the top shelf in the fridge with an angry *clunk*. With my demand obliged, she made a point of glaring at me over the door: a familiar combination of narrowed eyes, scrunched freckles, and tensed shoulders. An expression that screamed: *are you happy now, asshole?*

After a few seconds of unblinking silence, she slammed the fridge closed with enough force to cause a rush of air to inflate her burgundy *Earth, Wind, and Fire* T-shirt: a fitting climax to the whole melodramatic affair.

The commotion brought Ben into the kitchen, tufts of curly brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses cautiously peeking in from the hallway. Then he made the mistake of trying to defuse the situation before it was ready to simmer down.

*“I’m sure the bewitched syrup will still be here when you get home from school, honey. Unless your mother has a hankering for mid-day flapjacks, but the woman I married is definitely more of an eggs and bacon type of gal.”* My husband said with a warm chuckle. Neither Emi nor I acknowledged the attempt at levity.

Ben was insistent on cooling down arguments with humor. Sometimes, I resented him for that. It made me feel like he saw himself as *The Friendly Guy*, perpetually forcing me to accept the role of disciplinarian by default. If he never took anything seriously, what choice did I have?

I shot my husband an annoyed glance as Emi stomped past him. He sighed, rubbing his neck and putting his eyes to the floor, crestfallen.

*“Sorry, Hakura. Was just tryin’ to help,”* he murmured.

As he trudged out of the room, I said nothing. Not a word. Just watched him go, white-hot fire still burning behind my eyes.

In my youth, I struggled with anger. I tried to control it, but the emotion overwhelmed my better instincts more often than not. I’m much older now, and since then, I’ve gained a tighter grasp on my natural temper. I think Ben would agree, at least I hope he would.

He wasn’t around long enough to see me try harder.

Out of everything that was to come, out of all the horror that was to follow, I wish I could change that moment the most. In the decades that have passed, I’ve had thousands of dreams rewriting that snapshot in time. Instead of giving in to the anger, I swallow it and remind Ben I love him: A smile and a hug. Or a comment about how handsome he is. A kiss on the cheek. Or a peck on the lips. A lighthearted chuckle to match his own: *something* kinder than vexed silence.

Aaron’s Fight: A Father’s Battle for Life

""When Aaron told his son he had cancer, the first thing he asked was, 'Are you gonna die?'""

Aaron is 32, a father of four beautiful children, and someone who has always tackled life head-on. But leukemia doesn’t fight fair.

Doctors have told Aaron that without aggressive treatment, his chances of survival drop significantly. He needs chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant, and months of hospital care—but even with insurance, the costs are overwhelming.
The Diagnosis: Life Turned Upside Down

A month ago, Aaron was up before the sun, lacing up his boots, grabbing his coffee, heading to work. At night, he’d come home, throw his kids over his shoulders, and they’d wrestle on the couch until they passed out watching cartoons. He was invincible—or at least he thought he was.

Then came the fatigue. The bruises that wouldn’t fade. The night sweats that soaked through his sheets. After a visit to the ER, the doctors told him the devastating truth: acute myeloid leukemia (AML). His bone marrow wasn’t producing enough blood cells. His platelets had dropped dangerously low. And just like that, everything changed.

""I ain’t gonna lie, when they first told me, I cried. All I could think about was my kids. My baby, Story, isn’t even crawling yet. Avery, my three-year-old, still climbs into my lap every morning. My son Aaron Jr says he wants to grow up just like me. And my oldest, Brycen, keeps telling me to fight. I gotta be here for them. And that’s why I’m fighting.""


The Fear: What If I Don’t Make It?

Aaron tries to stay strong, but in the quiet moments—when the IV drips steadily in the hospital room, when he wakes up gasping for air from the pain—his biggest fear creeps in.

""What if I don’t make it? What if this fight isn’t enough?""

""I don’t like to think about it. But at night, when it’s quiet, when the hospital lights hum and the IV drips in my arm, I wonder… what happens if I don’t make it?""

""Who’s going to teach Aaron Jr how to shave? Who’s going to cheer the loudest at Story’s graduation? Who will fix Brycen’s bike or make Avery’s favorite pancakes on Sundays?""
""I’m fighting because I refuse to let that be my story. But I need help.""",0,1742157289.0,texas,1,0.42,False

In short: fear the ACTS176 protocol. (Part 1)","*“Mom! Mom!* ***Look!*** *It’s happening again,”* Emi squealed, captivated by the viscous maple syrup slowly floating to the top of the upright bottle on the kitchen table, stubbornly defying gravity.

My heart raced. Anxiety danced hectic circles around the base of my skull. My palms became damp.

God, I didn’t want to look.

\- - - - -

As crazy as it may sound, the sight of that bottle physically repulsed me.

Maybe I correctly sensed something terrible was on the horizon: recognized the phenomena as the harbinger of death that it truly was. That said, *the shift* took place a long time ago: half a century, give or take.

Retrospection has a funny way of painting over the original truth of a memory. In other words, when enough time has passed, you may find yourself recalling events with thoughts and feelings from the present inseperably baked in to the memory. Picking that apart is messy business: what’s original versus what’s been layered on after the fact, if you can even tell the difference anymore. So, trust me when I say that I find it difficult to remember that morning objectively, in isolation, and removed from everything that came after. I mean, it's possible that I *didn’t* feel what was coming beforehand: I could have just woken up pissed off that morning. That would certainly be enough to explain my strong reaction to Emi’s harmless excitement in my memory.

What I’m getting at is this: I don’t know that I can guarentee this story is one-hundred percent accurate. Not only that, but I’m the only one left to tell it, meaning my story is all *anyone* has. For better or worse, it’s about to become sanctified history.

If I’m being honest, I don’t believe that I’m misremembering much. I can still almost feel the way the air in the neighborhood felt heavy and electric in the days leading up to that otherwise unremarkable spring morning. I just *knew* something was desperately wrong: sensed it on the breeze like a looming thunderstorm.

Like I said, though.

I’m the only person left to tell this story.

The story they paid all of us survivors a great deal of money to keep buried.

\- - - - -

*“Emi - for the love of God, put the damn thing back in the fridge and get your books together.”* I shouted, my tone laced with far more vitriol than I intended.

We were already running late, and this wasn’t the agreed upon division of labor. She was supposed to be packing her bag while I put her lunch together. That was the deal. Instead, my daughter had been irritatingly derailed by our own little eighth wonder of the world.

*The magic syrup bottle.*

It was unclear *which* part was magical, though. Was the syrup supernaturally rising to the top of the container of its own accord, or had the magic bottle *enchanted* the syrup, thus causing sugary globules to float like the molten wax of a lava lamp?

*Maybe the Guinness Book of World Records has a wizard on retainer that can get to the bottom of that question when they stop by to evaluate the miracle*, I thought.

Sarcasm aside, my aggravation was actually a smokescreen. It was a loud, flashy emotion meant to obscure what I was actually feeling deep inside: fear. For an entire week, the syrup had been swimming against gravity, drifting above the air in the half-filled bottle against the laws of physics.

I couldn’t explain it, and that frightened me.

But! Everything else was normal. The atmosphere was breathable. The landscape appeared unchanged: grass grew, trees bloomed, birds flew. Our stomachs still churned acid and our hearts continued to pump blood. The gears of reality kept on turning like they always had, excluding that one miniscule anomaly: an insignificant bending of the rules, but nothing more.

*So then, why was I so damn terrified?*

Emi scowled, swiped the bottle off the table, and returned it to the top shelf in the fridge with an angry *clunk*. With my demand obliged, she made a point of glaring at me over the door: a familiar combination of narrowed eyes, scrunched freckles, and tensed shoulders. An expression that screamed: *are you happy now, asshole?*

After a few seconds of unblinking silence, she slammed the fridge closed with enough force to cause a rush of air to inflate her burgundy *Earth, Wind, and Fire* T-shirt: a fitting climax to the whole melodramatic affair.

The commotion brought Ben into the kitchen, tufts of curly brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses cautiously peeking in from the hallway. Then he made the mistake of trying to defuse the situation before it was ready to simmer down.

*“I’m sure the bewitched syrup will still be here when you get home from school, honey. Unless your mother has a hankering for mid-day flapjacks, but the woman I married is definitely more of an eggs and bacon type of gal.”* My husband said with a warm chuckle. Neither Emi nor I acknowledged the attempt at levity.

Ben was insistent on cooling down arguments with humor. Sometimes, I resented him for that. It made me feel like he saw himself as *The Friendly Guy*, perpetually forcing me to accept the role of disciplinarian by default. If he never took anything seriously, what choice did I have?

I shot my husband an annoyed glance as Emi stomped past him. He sighed, rubbing his neck and putting his eyes to the floor, crestfallen.

*“Sorry, Hakura. Was just tryin’ to help,”* he murmured.

As he trudged out of the room, I said nothing. Not a word. Just watched him go, white-hot fire still burning behind my eyes.

In my youth, I struggled with anger. I tried to control it, but the emotion overwhelmed my better instincts more often than not. I’m much older now, and since then, I’ve gained a tighter grasp on my natural temper. I think Ben would agree, at least I hope he would.

He wasn’t around long enough to see me try harder.

Out of everything that was to come, out of all the horror that was to follow, I wish I could change that moment the most. In the decades that have passed, I’ve had thousands of dreams rewriting that snapshot in time. Instead of giving in to the anger, I swallow it and remind Ben I love him: A smile and a hug. Or a comment about how handsome he is. A kiss on the cheek. Or a peck on the lips. A lighthearted chuckle to match his own: *something* kinder than vexed silence. Thousands of those revisions have lingered transiently in my mind’s unconscious eye, and when they do, I feel peace.

Until I wake up, at which point those revisions are painfully sucked back into the blissful ether of sleep, and I’m forced to confront reality.

That shitty moment was the last meaningful interaction I had with the love of my life.

Minutes later, he’d be falling into the sky.

\- - - - -

All things considered, the start of that morning was decidedly run-of-the-mill: The blue, cloudless view overhead. A gentle spring breeze twirling over trees in the throes of reawakening, cherry blossoms and magnolias budding triumphantly along their branches like fanfare to welcome the season. Our neighbors lining the streets and chitchatting while awaiting the arrival of the school bus to see their kids off for the day, cups of hot coffee in hand.

Everything as it should be and according to routine, with two notable exceptions.

The atmosphere looked distorted, like a grainy TV image just barely coming through a finicky antenna. It was subtle, but it was there. I swear I could almost feel the gritty static dragging against my skin as I followed Emi and Ben out the front door.

And, for some reason, Ulysses was outside. Between having no children and being an unapologetic recluse, our next-door neighbor’s attendance at this before-school ritual was out of character. On top of that, the sixty-something year old appeared distinctly unwell: bright red in the face, sweat dripping down his neck, eyes darting around their sockets like a pair of marble pinballs as he scanned the street from his front stoop.

Per usual, Emi bolted across the street as soon as she saw Regina, her childhood best friend, standing among the growing crowd of kids and parents.

Emi and Regina were inseparable: two kids lovingly conjoined at the hip since the day they met. Recollecting the good times they had together never fails to conjure a beautiful warmth at the center of my chest. At the same time, that warmth is inevitably followed by a creeping sense of unease: a devil lurking in the details.

That devil was looming behind Regina, smiling at my daughter as she approached.

*“Ben - Ulysses looks sick. I’m going to go see how he’s doing. Can you keep an eye on her? Barrett’s out today.”*

He nodded and jogged after our daughter, needing no further explanation.

\- - - - -

Six months prior to that morning, Regina’s father, known locally as *“Pastor B”* on account of his position in the local Born-Again parish, had slapped Emi across the face for creating too much noise while running up the stairs in his home. In the wake of that, we forbade Emi from spending time at Regina’s.

The girls really struggled with that decree since it drastically cut down on the time they could be together (Regina was not allowed to spend time at our house because it was *“much too loose and unabashedly sinful”*). Seeing Emi so depressed was absolutely killing us. Thankfully, Ben came up with the brilliant idea of walkie-talkies. The clunky blocks of black plastic he purchased at a nearby hardware store had quickly become the pair’s primary mode of socializing when they weren’t outside or at school together.

We pleaded for the sheriff to charge Barrett with assault. His response was something to the tune of *“No, I’m confident there’s been a misunderstanding”*. When we asked *how* there could possibly be a *misunderstanding* regarding a grown man slapping our daughter, he replied,

*“Well, because Pastor B* ***said*** *there was a misunderstanding. That’s all the proof I need.”*

Religious figures, especially where we lived, held a lot of sway in the community. Got away with *way* more than they should’ve. Even more so in the seventies.

Ben and I were beyond livid with the sheriff’s inaction. That said, there didn’t seem like much else we could do about the incident except support our daughter through it. The first night, she cried her heart out. By the next morning, though, she wasn’t very interested in talking about it, despite our gentle attempts to coax her into a longer conversation about the trauma.

Initially, we were worried she was holding too much in, but we developed another, certainly more unorthodox, means of catharsis and healing. Brainstorming demeaning nicknames for Barrett with Emi proved to be a surprisingly effective coping strategy. Brought some much needed comedy to the situation.

Ben came up with *Pastor Bald* on account his sleek, hairless scalp. Personally, I was more fond of my, admittedly less sterile, contribution.

*Reverend Dipshit*.

\- - - - -

Confident that Emi was being watched after, I paced across our yard to Ulysses. He was standing still as a statue at his open front door, one foot inside, one foot on his stoop. As I approached, he barely seemed to register my presence. Although his eyes had been darting around the block only a minute prior, they weren’t anymore. Now, his gaze was squarely fixed on the developing crowd of teenagers and parents at the bus stop.

In an attempt to get his attention, I gave Ulysses a wave and a friendly: *“Good morning, long time no see…”*

I guess he saw the wave in his peripheral vision, but the man skipped right over pleasantries in response. Instead, he asked me a question that immediately set off a veritable factory full of alarm bells in my head.

*“I-I thought the school bus came at 8. No, I was* ***sure*** *it came at 8. W-Why is everyone out now? It just turned 7:25.”* he said, the words trembling like a small dog neck-deep in snow. Sweat continued to pour down his face, practically drenching the collar of his pure white button-down.

*“Uhh…well…school board changed it to 7:30 a few weeks ago. Ulysses, are you al-”*

Before I could finish my sentence, a deep, animalistic scream arising from the down the street interrupted me. Reflexively, I swung my body around, trying to identify the source.

There was a man on the asphalt, gripping his head while writhing from side to side in a display of unbridled agony. From my vantage point, I couldn’t tell exactly *who* it was emitting the noise, but I watched a few of the parents detach from the larger group, sprinting to the wailing man’s aid.

For a moment, I found myself completely immobilized, stunned by the harrowing melody of his pain. Couldn’t move an inch. Being subjected to that degree of raw, undiluted torment had seemingly unplugged each and every one of my nerves from their sockets.

An unexpected *crash* from behind me quickly rebooted my nervous system, dumping gallons of adrenaline into veins in the process. I spun back around, nearly tripping over myself on account of the liquid energy coursing through me, which was overstimulating my muscles to the point of incoordination.

Ulysses had slammed his door shut. He shouted something to me, but I can’t recall what he said. Either I couldn’t hear it or I wasn’t capable of internalizing it amongst the chaos: it just didn’t stick in my memory.

Under the guidance of some newly activated primal autopilot, I didn’t attempt to clarify the message. Instead, my legs transported me towards the distress. I needed to make sure Emi was safe. Nothing more, nothing less.

God, I wish I remember what he said.

\- - - - -

Thirty seconds later, I placed a hand on Emi’s shoulder, startling her to high heaven and back. She yelped, gripped by a body-wide spasm that started from her head and radiated down.

*“Hey! Just me kiddo.”* I said, trying to sound reassuring as opposed to panic-stricken.

A silky black pony tail flipped over her shoulder as she turned around. Without hesitation, she sank into arms, hot tears falling down my collarbone as she quietly wept.

*“There’s…There’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom.”*

I’m a little ashamed to admit it, but I don’t remember much about Mr. Baker. All I can recall is that he was a mild-mannered Vietnam veteran that lived a few houses down from us, opposite to Ulysses. I think he suffered from a serious injury abroad: may have retained a fragment of a bullet somewhere in his head, requiring him to use a cane while walking around. I’m not completely sure of any of that, though.

Don’t remember his first name, don’t recall if he had a family or not, but I remember those words that Emi said to me: clear as day.

I imagine the phrase *“there’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom”* sticks out in my brain as a byproduct of the trauma that immediately followed.

There’s a terrible piece of our wiring as a species that programs traumatic events to be remembered as vividly as possible. Once imprinted, they seem to become a meticulous blow-by-blow recreation of the incident we’d kill to forget, every detail painstakingly etched into our psyche: some impossibly elaborate mosaic painted on the inside of our skulls, all-encompassing and inescapable, like the *“Creation of Adam”* on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

Emi said *“there’s something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom”* and I saw Ben a few yards away from us, kneeling over Mr. Baker, alturistic to a fault.

Then, the crackling explosion of a gunshot rang through the air.

The street erupted into chaos. People fled in all directions. I grabbed Emi tightly by the wrist. She was paralyzed: had to make her to start moving towards the house. Practically everyone was screaming in horrible solidarity with Mr. Baker. Someone elbowed me hard in the diaphragm, knocking the wind out of my lungs. Eventually, our feet landed on the sidewalk in front of our home. Then, a second gunshot. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from, nor did I see anyone injured.

A few steps away from the door, I noticed something else. The air felt increasingly palpable: thick and granular, like I was wading through an invisible sandstorm.

Once Emi was inside, I immediately turned around to search for Ben.

When I spotted him, my heartbeat became erratic. It floundered and thrashed inside my chest like the dying movements of a beached shark. Between the elbow to my diaphragm and the sheer terror of it all, I could feel myself gasping and panting, anchoring my hand to the door frame to prevent myself from keeling over.

He was halfway across the street, pulling Mr. Baker towards our house. To this day, I’m not sure if he was aware of the sedan barreling down the road, going entirely too fast to break in time.

I met my husband’s eyes. Waves of disbelief pulsed down my spine, sharp and electric. I don’t recall him looking scared: no, Ben was focused. He got like that when something important was on the line.

Before I could even call out, the runaway car was only a few feet from crushing the both of them: then, a tainted miracle.

An experience that lies somewhere between divine intervention and a cruel practical joke.

The front of the car spontaneously tilted upwards, like it was starting to drive up the big first incline of an unseen wooden roller coaster. Somehow, it barely cleared both Ben and Mr. Baker in the nick of time. It hovered over them, cloaking their bodies in its eerie shadow. Then, it just kept going, farther and farther into the atmosphere, without any signs that it would eventually return to the earth.

Before I was able to feel even an ounce of relief, it all started to happen.

The shift.

In order to understand, I need you to imagine you’re currently living on the inside of a snow globe. Not only that, but you’ve actually unknowingly lived in a snow globe your entire life: one that’s been sitting on the top shelf of some antique shop, completely untouched by human hands for decades.

my teeth are pretty crooked, and the dentist said i have a little recession of the gum, but x rays checked out fine. i had an upper tooth extracted 11/20/24 that left a couple bone spurs that the dentist rendered harmless

i was an avid weed smoker but since stopped for two weeks—i’m defintely a mouth breather and frequently wake up with a dry mouth

i wake up and my teeth feel like they’re burning (my tongue often does too, as if i drank hot coffee) the ache comes from my lower gum across a couple teeth….i’m feeling so defeated not having answers. i have an orthodontist appointment 3/20 for invisalign consultation

In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

This also serves as a megathread for coffee deals on the internet. If you see a good deal, post it here! However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Daily Question Thread would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask! And please, ask for permission first rather than forgiveness later.",0,1742156828.0,Coffee,1,0.4,False

I was looking at my phone but you know I wasn’t really focused on anything so at the same time I could see where he was looking at. He turned his head to left then continued looking down again at his phone. So I looked at where he looked at and I saw three girls with short dresses and shorts so he was checking them.

1jcukhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1jcukhb/my_r/,My R.,"I’m trying to organize my thoughts but you know how I get when my feelings and thoughts are just so big that I need to let them out and try to make some sense out of them. You were always good at helping me with that. I keep going back through everything trying to figure out what I missed and how I could have done things differently and I know my mind is playing tricks because I will remember something differently each time to the point that I don’t know what I should trust. 
You always said we needed to talk about everything and I agree, and even when it was hard I did. It always brought us closer. This is why I don’t understand why you didn’t talk to me about this. It wasn’t even a discussion. You just decided for us that it was over. I think I was just too confused by everything and in shock to really question anything at the time. You said it was what you needed so of course I said okay because all I ever wanted was to make you happy.

It was so much more than just our relationship though and you know that. You were the safe space for me to just be and I thought that was what you also wanted. If it had gotten to be too much I wish you had told me. Our nighttime routine wasn’t happening as often, i see this now. I see a lot now.
I am trying to keep the good habits but without that dynamic it’s hard.

I worry if you have any support. Yes, I miss you. I have missed you every day but what leaves me with the constant ache in my heart is thinking that you’re hurting and not letting anyone else be there for you. Please don’t punish yourself because you are feeling bad or depressed or over stressed. It’s okay to have bad days and you don’t have to be the one that takes care of everyone all the time, it’s okay to need someone to help you too.

You made me better in so many ways and I love you so much for all the things you do and how you would remember all the little things I said. You always said how happy I made you and how much you liked our coffee dates. That was always the best part of my day because I loved getting to see you smile and hearing your laugh. And I wish I could hear you say “hi baby” one more time. You know how much I love your voice. 

I made my last ditch effort the other day and I have probably read too much romance but I was holding onto hope that I might hear something from you. I think I probably need to just let go. This is the last day until that account is gone forever  and I think I started to panic and was hoping you would try to reach out and stop it but I don’t think that’s going to happen. I still love you, I love you forever

I said it was okay and we could go out when we're both next free in a fortnight, but I know she's probably bullshitting me. I was a bit upset because part of me wanted to see where this could lead, but part of me thinks it just confirms that either she's not interested or she's not for me, and i may have dodged a bullet if shes got 'mental health issues' (in other words,  baggage i just dont need at my age).

I wanna know since after that relationship it scarred me deep that i dont even trust anyone anymore. 

I(23M), 15 at the time I met my ex (23F) in school where she teaches one of our subjects, We didnt start dating until i graduated from High-School, and started my seniors. from time to time she'll try to have a small coversation with me thru DM or My Shared post (Facebook).

A whole lot back story that i hope you guys enjoy  of how we started talking then transitioned to dating. 

At that time i wasn't really looking forward to having a new relationship as i just broke up with a girl so we're gonna call her Magie, who's main reason why she broke up with me is her mother didnt like me as her mom is also one of my teacher, i wasn't really a student who gives his all since i know i can pass barely with a little to non-effort. so she deemed me as someone who's not really going to accomplish anything in life. so when she found out that her daughter, The Valedictorian of our batch is dating me, and we really wanna make it official. She tried to come up clean with her mom since she really respects her. but ye didnt turn the way wanted it to. Her mom talked to her that she deserves someone who doesn't live by the moment and she deserves someone who has plans and all of that stuff, so that night she called me crying as she tells me how things happened. i was heartbroken, i asked her if what she wants to do since it's her choice. at first Maggie wanna sneak out and stuff and still make it work but in the end it's like she's not really trying as hard since she found someone else in her class. i knew about it, i felt it but i didn't really give it a thought since i trust her. well well well, i dont if i consider it cheating but yep she ended things between us then started dating her classmate.


I was too broken hearted atm that i don't really know what to do as i tried to get back at maggie and started dating her friend which she's really close with but i couldn't pull thru as i am not the person who i thought i can be, because I saw her situation, her struggles and family stability. i can't as i was the reasons to her laughs, her subjects in her poems, the hand that moves her brush, and i can't look her in the eyes as she admires mine. the school mates really loved her as she is attentive and trying her best at everything, a bundle of joy they say she was. eventually i told her the truth. the first weeks aren't really that good, ngl even the upcoming months since she's the student head of their department and really close with the students. no one really talked to me except my classmates and close friends. (I know this isn't really part of the story i just want to include the reasons why i started talking to her(My teacher))

I was getting depressed, sleeping 22 hours during weekends, stopped socializing tbh I barely even have a social life since my parents are strict so i can't go out past 7PM just friends that lives near me and played with thru video games, eats only when i really have to since i started puking blood since my stomach doesnt really have anything in it which in the end i ended throwing up even water is being rejected by my body ATT so wasn't really in a great place since i thought we can be highschool sweethearts. i know i sound a sucker for getting depressed for that reason and at that age too, but what can i say. that's the first ever connection i have ever felt with a person since my parent aren't really around and i was being tossed person after person to take care of me. 

and this where we started talking, i change my profile picture that time since i want to start bouncing back. She commented that ""You looked good and thinner since you graduated"" and i replied ""Thank you ma'am"", then she started replying to my stories either of me singing or just random funny stuff. since she was my teacher i see her as someone who has deeper knowledge when it comes to things that involves love and moving on, so i console her about everything and what i did and what would she do if she were the one who's in Maggie's shoes. (yes i still remember because i didnt delete any of my conversations with anyone who i talk to) Of couse at the time i didnt really know what her motives are,  so she told me that she'll convince her mother and fight for me. as for my decision to try to get back at her she laughed it off and asked why i didnt pull thru as i can clearly get maggie's friend. (ik i sound like someone who's trying to make himself look good but i'm just average looking guy with good sense of humor, a good listener, and knows what to say at the right time and moment) i told her that i couldn't do it because of the reason from above. and i missed the first red flag, she told me that i should've inflicted it to someone else that time so i can really feel that i'm in control. after that conversation, i didnt reply to her last chat for 2-3 days as i was busy and i still her as someone who's older and my teacher.


So i posted another story of me and my dog where she replies that my dog looks cute, and the owner too hoping that she can meet both. I dont really know what to do that time since i was obviously shocked why she wanted to meet me back then, so i replied with a laugh and joked about it then continue the conversation asking what did i eat, what am i doing and how's my current situation and am i doing good, then proceeds to what are my hobbies, what's my favorite food and who is my favorite singer a bunch of things that i didnt really know what was happening and i was just answering as she was my teacher and i respect her. I'm telling you now i was clueless the whole time because it was my first, Almost of everything.



From that moment I noticed something's wrong, it wasn't just a casual talk because that talked lasted for a whole day non stop as it was summer vacation and i didnt know what to do since i dont really know what's happening. so that night i told her that i'm going to sleep and she says goodnight and right before i wake up, there's already  good morning and did i already eat breakfast message. In my head i was thinking that ""wow, she's really considerate teacher, for staying by my side thru my hardest moment"". Oh boy, Oh boy how wrong am i. in a span of two weeks, i didn't really know what was happening we were just sending message, voice message of singing, pictures of what we're eating and what i'm wearing to go out (she always ask if she can see) who am i with and what we're doing and i just simply answer, if i can see the person i was back then i'll just slap him and tell him what's happening. in her side, i dont really ask what she's wearing and what she's doing since i dont really think about it. in the case of her pictures she's asking if she looks good in those outfits, or suddenly she's gonna send me a picture of what she's doing and she'll ask me if i ever tried that or do i know that. 




2 weeks passed by same routine, suddenly i felt something, because we weren't just texting anymore we started video chatting and caling from day to night and i didnt even see that coming since i have never done that before with my previous relationships so it was a new ground for me so i didnt know what it meant i thought she was just being moddest as i was still depressed. and it wasn't, one night she asked me what my grounds are in relationships. so i told her that i still can't, that i just healed (it was already 4 months that passed by we started talking 3 months since the incident) and i dont know if i can trust someone new. then she started convincing me that i should try trusting again, i was hesitant for 3 weeks straight she kept budging me about that i should try again, and i need to look who's in front of me and open my eyes and try to realize what i'm doing that time. and that time it hit me, she wasn't checking on me. she was flirting the whole time as i realize that she told me that the whole time, from when i was still her student she liked me and had feelings for me as i was always making her laugh and she found me cute which is weird. laugh i understand, don't get me wrong she's beautiful like every student that she teaches at liked her as in liked her liked her some students even tried to hit on her since she's only 23 and around 4'11"", one eyelid eyes, small nose thick lips, thin eyebrows and small face. so she didnt date me because she doesnt have a choice. and that time she went straight forward, if we can see each other and start dating. i was reluctant at the time because she was older, and she laughed it off and told me that she's small and she has a baby face so no one will really bat an eye. so eventually i gave in. first date, we ate outside after that she asked me if she can go to my house and meet my parents (yes, too fast and i didnt even know that it was that fast because that was the first time i introduced someone to them) my parents didnt really care since my father is 10 years older than my mom. my dad asked her how we met and she was honest, my dad smiled at me and gave me money as for my mom she didnt really say anything as the woman i'm dating is the same age as my elder sister. 




Right after the talk with my parents, we came into my room. i toured her around and we talked for a while, catching up and asking about things around my room. we were laying on my bed and suddenly we looked at each other in the eyes then i move mine to her lips. it hits me, she was really beautiful. i was about to kiss her lips but i stopped since it was gonna be my first time and got scared that i will mess up, so i kissed her forehead down to her nose then her chin but when i'm about to kiss her in the lips i got embarrassed of what i'm doing since that was our official first date since we last saw each other. she smiled then she did the same and did what i couldn't, my first kiss. right after that meeting, a few days later my dad started puking blood he has Tubercolosis from non-stop smoking. i kid you not that my father smokes 2 pack of cigarettes a day. so we had to a different state as he wants to come home to our hometown, thinking that he might perish. he wants it to be where he grew up. I wanted to stay, but my mom talked to me. she wants me to come with them as i am the youngest, and i'm the only one that actually grew up with them hence being strict. she wants me to be there, for my father. I was mad, i was angry because i wanted to be with my ex that time. i wanted to be with her all the time, i even suggested that i'd live with my sister for the mean time and finished seniors in my current just so i can be with my ex. i then accepted, but on one condition that i'll live with my sister till school starts. 



So i had about 2-3 weeks, they agreed. my sister usually isnt home as much as she was a supervisor in a company that her boyfriend's uncle owned and most of the time she's at her boyfriends so i'm left all alone in her apartment with my ex. so the first week, nothing really happened. we're just watching movies, eating together and help her with things before school starts. (she told me that one of my merrit is that i'm smart, i just dont really give in that much which is why we started joking around when i was still her student) then we'll lay in the bed, i have my own bed at my sisters so please stop the weirds. continuing, laying on my bed, caressing her hair while my eyes are closed trying to nap while she used my arms as pillow i suddenly felt her breath close to my skin, then starts kissing my neck looking at her she sat up and goes on the top of my body and starts kissing me then starts moving her hips. forgot this part of the detail, she's a dancer. i'm not lying, the feeling of experiencing that for the first time made me realize it's not like i imagined it, it was so much better. of course the idiot i am, i stopped as she was about to remove her shirt and i sat up and kissed her then asked her if she wants a coffee and something to eat. then stood up to make one.



Everyday for 3 weeks she's always with me. she'll only come home to hers from morning to get a new set of clothes. 2nd Week, after she went home the next morning she comes back to my sisters house intentionally wearing sexy outfit, a fitted dress. as i always do for the past week. i already made the breakfast, coffee and asked her if she wants anything. (yep, i know how to take care of myself since while my parents are strict i'm alone in the house all the time) after breakfast, a series while we're doing her things that she needs to prepare for school. (she left it in my room as it's not done yet) and then we layed on the bed again, as i got tired because i woke up early to see her go and go home to her house and wait for her to comeback. i was hugging her at that time and i didnt realize that i was close to her chest, then she suddenly took my hand as the buttons to her dress are opened and place it inside her chest. (I dont really wanna say the other word as i grew up mostly with my sister and i dont wanna call it in a manner that i'm disrespecting a womans body) this time i don't wanna make her feel that i'm avoiding and i don't want her, because last time i already stopped in the middle. so i carried on this time so i can make her feel that she's not being too forceful. to be honest, i wasn't really ready because i'm too young and scared that she might get pregnant. i'm a student, and she's a teacher. she might get fired and i can't find a way to support a child if she got pregnant. so as long as i can, i held my grit and tried my best to refuse as i am still not ready. 


I hope you understand that at that time was my first physical relationship, and i dont wanna lose her as she helped me through my hardest situation. 
Here it is, as my hand is inside her chest. she put her hands inside my shorts and started hj, i asked what she was doing and she just smiled and told me that i should enjoy it. as she is curious too what it felt like to do that, i then found that day that she was bisexual and mostly that she's in a relationships with are women. as i'm writing this, i realized that i dated 5 bisexual from highschool to college. i dunno what i did but i'll just think about it later. so as she do that i talked to her that i'm not ready to go past this yet as i'm scared of pregnancyas that was my first time, she told me that we can do it with protection and to my surprise she already has it. i don't really know how to use protection but still, i wasn't ready and she's starting to get irritable, angry and treating me silently and she even told me that she'd rather go home. so i eventually told her that we can try, as this is my first time she suggested that we shouldn't do it with condom for the thrill and for me to feel it more. as i am scared that she might get mad and go home, I gave in. after what happened, i'm not gonna lie. i enjoyed it, but i got scared because she was at the top and didn't stop even though i'm telling her that i'm about to, and she just continued and let me do it there. later on she told me she was on pills. i was the first guy she dated back that's why she was ready and looking forward to doing it. 

as it already happened, it will happen more than usual within that 2 weeks span to 3 weeks. Fast forward to when i moved with my parents, and the school started. First day was a disaster, I'm a transfer student and i hardly know anyone even though i grew up there till i was 7. the only good thing is at least i'm with my niece, she's also the same grade as i am. she's my niece since her father is my first cousin, and the first day. i asked her where my room was since she knew the school more than i am, that girl trolled me and i got in the wrong class. i sat there for 1 hour until the teacher started calling each and every student. i wasn't called, i waited for an hour. i met a plenty of girls in that room and boys, the major that i picked in senior was mostly composed of girls and a little to none boys(seems like they don't want to focus finance) so i met a lot of girls and they kinda liked me during that hour since i made them laugh, told them about myself a little, where i grew up and they asked me if the can take a picture with me. so i did, i even glimpse someone from the front sit mirroring thru her phone what i look like. And i smiled and asked what her name is, thru introduction i didn't forget to tell them that i had a girlfriend. they just joked around and told me that the dog is much easier to catch when it's in a leash. which i didn't really mind at that time. 


I know this might sound superficial, but it's the truth. i didnt realize until then that i had a glow up since my ex was teaching me how to style myself, what perfume to wear and stuffs so that i can be more presentable her words. you might wonder what i look like, i'm a mixed between spanish/french from my dad and mom who's asian. i dont really care what myself looks like because it's just a face, what matters is how you treat others. I know i sound superficial, but i grew up in a family who's a devoted catholic and half my childhood between my grandparents, cousins, and aunties that took care of me and my sister as a child are devoted catholic too so they always teach me that. they may forget what you look like, but the kindness you showed them will leave a mark. so that's what i did. Enough with history, i got to my room, more embarrassing moments. a girl from my class asked if she can shake my hand as she introduces herself and boldly say single, depending on my status. as i introduced myself, i told the class i had a girlfriend. class ended told her what happened, and suddenly she asked for my social media accounts, asked for an update every hour or 30 mins, demands for a reply in 5-10 mins after she sent a message. she knew my schedule so during my break she wants us to facetime and i agreed to all of her terms, she doesnt even want me to sit close to my classmates as most of them are girls. my classroom consist of 37 girls and 5 boys, which of 2 are gays/bisexual. i didnt really have any social life that school year, since she's always on my back, like i have someone who's controlling every move i take. then came Iya, not her real name. we talked most of the time as she is the only one that my ex doesnt know, but i know that she likes me as she's always joking about that if me and my ex broke up she was there, and i hope that was only a joke. in One of the School breaks, Iya not knowing i was on a call blurted out the same joke. ex heard of it and she saw Iya dancing in front of me, not erotically just like ballroom stuff but teasingly and when she saw that i was on a call. she rushed back to the classroom, ex got mad. asked me to block that girl, and got tighter with the things that she wants to happen. 




I can't even to out with my classmates because of her since my parents doesnt mind me going out anymore because we live in a province. so ye, back to the story. Ms.C my teacher arranged a pajama party with the whole class, Ms. C is rich. she have a house with a full studio for dancing and that's where we could sleep, so after the dance contest she arranged that and as i was celebrating with my classmates, she calls and demanded that i get home immediatly either she'll block me or break up with me. so after i ate dinner with my classmate, i ran to our house as the moment she called and i didnt answer. she'll block me and unblock me the next morning like nothing happened. 




I got used to it, and thought that i'll be okay. that we can make it through. but as the time goes by, even by a single notification from my phone. my body, brain and heart doesnt know what to do. i'm not even excited anymore when i receive her messages, it was straight up fear. fear that maybe i did something wrong again, that she might block and break up with me again. sometimes from too much anxiety. i tried to leave my phone in my house and drove around just to get my head clear, the moment i returned my mom asked me where i came from because my ex called my parents and siblings. and the moment i look at my messages it was full of words that cuts my soul, and when i replied she just told me that she was sorry and worried. i confronted her attitude lately and told me that it was my fault, that why am i close with my classmates so as a devoted boyfriend. i walked away and never interacted with my classmates again. 


Monthly i go to where she lives, she pays for everything since i was still a student. so most of it just doing it, one morning i told her that i dont want to do it yet and she slapped me. she dont even wants us to go out, she just wants us to stay at her place to do it anytime she wants to and when i want to say that i dont want to yet, she either scratch me on my back and slaps me again. 


After that meet up, comes My Birth month. first week, she suddenly accused me that i was cheating. that i had someone else on the side that's why i dont want to do it as often as she wants. (she usually wants to do it 10 TIMES A Day) then i reassured her, and then during one call while sharing her screen as she is showing me something. she opened facebook lite, mistook it for the main version and i saw a facebook account that i dont recognize with a chat from a person that i once saw in her dms. i confronted her who's account was that and she shrugged it off and told me that it was Her friend's Ezra, not her real name. i felt again what i felt before i met her, the uneasiness. as i was 80 miles away, i can't really do anything about it. so My Birthday comes. she told me that she went outside to buy things for my bday, and told me to help myself in the house as i have a key. i got there 6 am, and she got home at 5pm. which is suspicious, since she knew that i was at her place. i didnt ask her that much because i'm just suspecting, she started cooking and there's a message in her phone, i tried to grab it and she suddenly jumped to get it from kitchen to dining table she rushed. i didnt give her the phone, and read it all in her face. I wanted to go home that night, i didnt even feel anything. i was more hurt that what i overthink was right, i tried to go home that night. she kept explaining that it wasn't her account, that it was Ezra's. it's not just one, she has like 5 people in that dummy account. 2 women and 3 men, what hurts me is they all knew. i didnt even say anything, i didnt even try to argue. i just stood there holding my bag, letters (which i wrote to assure her everyday for 30 days, for everytime that she comes up to my mind) and my shoes. she cried, and cried telling me that it was a mistake from it's my fault because i'm always away and i'm always busy to then blaming Ezra again because originally it was Ezra's account first. to just slapping me and scratching me the whole way, my back was full of scratches as i tried to get through her so i can get out. i didnt even feel anything up to that point till she told me that she might be pregnant so i stayed at her place for 3 more days just to be sure, and get myself together. i almost dropped out and find a job rightawat which she is always insisting, and on 3rd day i begged her if she can let me go home as i am confused, mentally and emotionally exhausted. 




For the first 2 weeks i became distant and cold, 3rd week i tried to not give her enough attention and then she called my parents telling them that she's pregnant, so my parents asked me to go to her place right away. since my mom experience the same situation and the father of my half father didnt even show up at least once. so i came back to her place that day, and didn't expect me that i'll go there that day. i saw one of her tampons in the trash bin, asking why. after that i came home again. talked to my parents that my ex and i broke up, that she wasn't really pregnant.


i blocked her, in all of my socials. and she still manages to find a way to message me, through her dummy/burner account. she asked first if we can still fix it, and later on expresses that she'll even accept to be FWB/FUBU. but i just can't anymore. 
oh and yep, i got her the same feeling she gave me on My Birtyday. I broke up with her on her's. 

 

I healed my self for 3 years, same situation with Maggie. i dropped out of school for the second semester as my health is failing, i was always sick, can't eat and dropped around 14 lbs. tried again and just couldn't. for 6 years i stopped trying focused on myself, i took Finance and Accounting hope that i'll be able to pass and start my Juris doctor this year! 


Thank you, this might be long. but i just want to vent out, since i didn't really tell anyone what happened. i stopped caring a long time ago what other people might think. i hope that you'll have advice for my situation.

1jcui85,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeFriendsUK/comments/1jcui85/f23_south_england/,F23 south England.,"Hey, nice to meet ya. 
Don't really have anything special going on in my life social wise atm, I'm content just having family around but sometimes would like a mate to chill with, go for drives/coffee, smoke (I'm 420 friendly lol).
I love animals, nature and yapping 😁 I love talking/over explaining things I'm interested in once I get a convo going 😂 
I start of shy with friendships lol but I'm pretty interesting once you get to know me, or so I've heard haha.
