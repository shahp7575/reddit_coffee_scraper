I’m a 29-year-old disabled neurodivergent single parent living in Louisville. I work, I parent, but most days I do it alone.

I’m not looking for a mom group, a text thread, a group hike, or small talk. I’m just hoping that maybe there’s one other person out there who knows what it feels like to carry too much alone and still want something real.

If you’re also ND (or at least ND-aware), also craving a connection that doesn’t feel like a performance, and you’re local—maybe we could meet up sometime. Coffee, a walk, sitting in silence—no expectations. Just real presence.

I’m only free on weekdays and I don’t have a ton of energy. But I’m showing up here because I want to believe someone else might still be looking too. ",2,1750536639.0,boulder,0,1.0,False
1lh5msj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lh5msj/shes_10_years_older_has_a_bf_but_wants_to_meet_up/,"She‘s 10 years older, has a bf but wants to meet up","I (24M) currently work as a banking trainee, and I have three days left at the branch. One of my coworkers (34F) has shown repeated signs of interest. We’re both in retail banking now, but when I first joined, I was in securities. Despite being in a different department, she would regularly come to my desk to talk, touch my arm or shoulders, and once even gave me a shoulder massage out of nowhere. She would ask personal questions and seek eye contact constantly. When I looked at her, she’d always smile.

She once showed me a picture of herself and asked what I thought. When I said her jacket looked childish, she teased me with: “You’d probably tell your girlfriend what to wear, right?” and tested my confidence with follow-up comments.

Eventually, she asked for my number and said: “We should get a coffee sometime.” So we met up for the first time outside of work. Right at the start, she told me that her boyfriend had dropped her off and was out shopping during our meetup. That caught me off guard, but I played it cool. She already mentioned her boyfriend before she started flirting with me at work

The date itself was nice but unclear. I told her she looks great when we met, and she returned it. I asked how she had perceived me when I first joined the branch, and she gave a personality-type answer (Persolog “blue” – analytical, structured). I told her my impression of her, ending with: “…and then I wondered: is she flirting with me?” She laughed and said something like, “I’m just a very nice person.”

Later during the date, she casually said: “You could come to my place sometime… maybe bring someone with you.” Which was weird – like she wanted to invite me, but also protect herself from the implications. We ended the date with a warm hug, and she said: “We’ll text.”

She also told me she trusted me more than other colleagues and opened up about past mental health struggles and issues at work. Ironically, she told me that another male colleague (married with kids) had tried to hit on her, and she judged him harshly. That struck me as hypocritical, since she was meeting me behind her boyfriend’s back.

How do I approach this situation if I want to sleep with her – but also leave room for something more?",1,1750536629.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1lh5ltu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1lh5ltu/i_think_my_bfs_mom_has_bpd_she_is_wreaking_havoc/,I think my bf’s mom has BPD. She is wreaking havoc on my mental health,"When I started dating my boyfriend things were good. I met his parents and the dad was distant but polite. The mother asked constant questions, maybe even my star sign. At first everything I said was magical. I was so attractive, so smart, so interesting. I could see right away she was a bit enmeshed with my boyfriend (later I would find out she told him he’s the only male relative she has ever loved. She also put a throw pillow on his bed about how he’s the most special person because he knows what her heartbeat sounds like from the inside). 
Anyways, over time she started over sharing her traumas and trying to learn mine. She decided to go to school to be a therapist but dropped out. In the meantime she: told me about a half sister she discovered later in life. And when I said maybe it was nice to have another family member she screamed “you’re bullshit!” At me and slammed a door so hard the glass almost broke because she hates the half sister (I didn’t know that, was just making conversation; she never addressed or apologized for this). 
-my friend asked me to emergency baby sit her kids one night as their dad was being his loser self and wouldn’t pick them up while she was about to go on vacation. I was working so asked my boyfriend to step in until my shift ended. His mother picked me up from work with her sister and my boyfriend under the guise of giving me a lift to my friend’s house and accused my friend of being a shit person, that my friend’s ex was going to accuse my boyfriend of being a pedo for watching the kids, and basically ranted for 20 minutes about how I’m an asshole and don’t care about her son and my friends are shit. Her sister was silent (and drunk) the whole time. None is this is true and my boyfriend stuck up for me. She eventually sent me an apology text two days later. 

After this she texted and hounded me incessantly, constantly wanting to meet for dinner or coffee. I always made an excuse. I found her boundaries to be goddawful and her entitlement up to the roof. I didn’t feel how she spoke to people to be appropriate. Her husband always blindly supports whatever she says or does though she leaves every job within a year because of her friction with coworkers and she doesn’t have a single friend.  

I had a birthday a few months later and she insisted on throwing a family party. I explicitly stated I didn’t feel comfortable with that and don’t like that kind of attention (and I only knew his extended family for 5 months so didn’t feel it was appropriate to Al’s them to celebrate me like that). She stated we would have dinner just me, my boyfriend and her and her husband. Fine, I could do that. On the day of my birthday, I found out she invited her husband’s parents, who barely knew me for the dinner. This meant two 80 year olds had to drive over an hour for a girlfriend they met once and had to buy her a gift. I felt mortified they had to do that. They didn’t know me and shouldn’t have to spend their time and little pension on me. At one point I think the dad sensed how uncomfortable I was and got annoyed. Under his breath he called me a lesbian, but I am the only one that heard clearly. My boyfriend asked what he said and the dad smiled and said “oh, nothing.” 

Over the next year or so I avoided them at all costs and made every excuse in the book. My boyfriend understood my distance but he wanted to close the gap and asked me to come to more family parties/BBQs. I didn’t for a long time but eventually gave in to make him happy. I helped him pay for birthday and Christmas gifts. I made a flower arrangement for his mother. I gave his younger sisters cash for their birthday, I brought wine and food etc. nice stuff. When we visited my parents in another country my parents took care of us and made sure we had a nice time. 

Then I came to a family party late (had work) and the air had been sucked out of the room. I tried to hug a cousin hello and the cousin stepped back. The aunts whispered and pointed and smirked at me with the mom. The mom openly sneered at me. I left after an hour. 

Then Christmas came and boyfriend asked me to stay for a night or two. I did, and offered to prepare a meal for the family the day after christmas. The mother badgered me the whole time and forced me to serve dinner before it was ready, this was because she “was starving.” Then she argued with my boyfriend upstairs that I was using them and their house because I didn’t like my roommate (it’s true I was having an issue with the roommate, but push to shove I’d have preferred to rent a hotel room with my bf, not spend the night in her house I only did that because he asked). Needless to say, I ended up having to leave the house and the boyfriend packed my things and brought them to my apartment . She never apologized for this. Months later she criticized me to my boyfriend and said I was being awful because I hadn’t offered to return to the house and have us all sit down and discuss what happened and why I had to leave. 

We didn’t speak for months. At some point the dad asked me for a favor, I felt this was wrong as our last communication was poor and I don’t think you should ask favors of people you aren’t on very good terms with. His jeans were mixed up in the laundry and accidentally taken by my boyfriend. I was asked to bring them to the dad but I brought them to his work as it would take me an hour to get tot heir house but half an hour to his work. I let him know I was doing that and he asked a coworker to meet me outside to collect them. The coworker was rude to me and spoke to me like I’m stupid for coming to the work place. 

At some point in March she claimed my boyfriend had to cancel his plans to stay the night at my place because his 18 year old sisters couldn’t be left alone in the house for one night while her and her husband spent the night in a hotel somewhere. The girls have trackers on their phones and there’s a ring doorbell. However, I recently learned one of them is now traveling with a boy to Amsterdam for the week and the parents are footing the bill. She wasn’t safe in her own home for one night but she can travel hundreds of miles to a place where drugs are legal and that’s okay? I did address this with the boyfriend and he agreed his mom has control issues and that the only reason he had to stay with his sisters and cancel plans with me is because his mom decided he had had enough time with me and it was time to come home. I’m still angry about this as it proves what I was saying all along. 

My birthday was in April. She gave me a card that asked to meet with me with a giftcard for a place going out of business. She texted me before I woke up asking to meet me. She had her two daughters send me the same message when I haven’t seen them since Christmas either. I felt this was controlling and forceful. We don’t have that relationship, don’t badger me on my birthday and use your daughters to do the same. 

It feels like she lashes out at me constantly, then tries to act like nothing is wrong and that she’s entitled to a close relationship with me when she has fostered the opposite. I genuinely think she’s borderline. 

My boyfriend has always stood up for me and told her at the worst conflicts she’s wrong but doesn’t correct the day to day smaller issues. He claims she has said she loves me and doesn’t understand why I don’t come by more often. He believes her, I don’t. I think it’s control and manipulation and he doesn’t see it. I think she’s weirdly obsessed with her son and sees me as a threat. She doesn’t like I have different opinions than her and doesn’t like I’ve made her look poorly to her son with her outbursts. Her husband is a flaccid enabler, but he does act out with passive aggressive behavior/comments (such as the lesbian comment on my birthday). Also he’s literally flaccid, as in he can’t it up. I know this because the mother made a comment to my boyfriend and his sisters about it. She didn’t care about how that would make her husband feel or how inappropriate it is for her children to know that. 

This was mostly a rant/vent, but I don’t know what to do. I love my boyfriend and want to marry him but his family is a nightmare (there’s plenty more I haven’t shared), but the idea of me having a baby with him and having that ignite more craziness with his mother makes me sick to my stomach.  I wouldn’t trust her with my child as she’s genuinely stupid as well (was told to put rice on electronics that have gotten wet and she boiled rice and tried to pour the hot rice and water onto a wet computer). 

I set a hard boundary and told my boyfriend I will see them at his birthday and Christmas for two hours and then I’m leaving but he keeps wanting me to meet them more often. He feels they have made mistakes but mean well, and he wants me to “bridge the gap” for a more positive relationship. I feel like I keep giving up a boundary just to get slapped in the face by his crazy mother.  I see a woman who is emotionally stunted, controlling, unstable and won’t change. She has her husband to reinforce her every whim, and she sucks up massively to my boyfriend (and probably texts him more than I do). How do I explain to my boyfriend that his mother is crazy and mean and controlling and won’t change and I don’t need to keep giving her chances?

They don’t ask with what, just glance at
the burn and call it a cut.
They don’t see the names I let go when
my grip gave out, the prayers I whispered
through clenched teeth and sleepless doubt.

I’ve swallowed the ache with my morning coffee,
made bargains with shadows no one else could see.
Grief made a home in the bend of my spine,
I fed it my laughter, and called it mine.

I’ve folded my fury in grocery store aisles,
bit down on heartbreak and graciously bowed.
I’ve clapped through the eulogies,
nodded along,
then cried in my car with the radio on.

I kept all her voicemails but never felt heard.
She loved loudly, but always kept me on the periphery,
out of sight and blurred.

She didn’t protect me, but taught me to bend,
to smirk through the fracture and heave within.
I learned to stitch up my own wounds,
to salvage my name from the places she left it to rot.

This made me the mother her love was not.

I realized that my chaotic mornings often set the tone for my day. Over the past few months, I’ve been experimenting with different routines, and I’ve found a combination that really works:

1. **Waking up 30 minutes earlier:** This gave me time to reflect before diving into the day.
2. **Practicing 10 minutes of mindfulness meditation:** Apps like Calm or Headspace have been game changers.
3. **Switching from coffee to green tea:** The change made me feel less jittery yet focused.
4. **Writing down my top 3 priorities for the day:** Keeping it simple helped me feel accomplished.

I'd love to hear how others have adjusted their routines to prioritize mental clarity as they’ve aged. What small changes have made a big impact for you?",1,1750536464.0,WellnessOver30,0,1.0,False

1lh5iea,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1lh5iea/ma_experience_hoping_to_help_someone_else/,MA experience - hoping to help someone else,"Hi guys,

So I had my MA about 2.5 weeks ago at 8 weeks and was really anxious before hand about the physical experience itself, so I'm hoping to help anyone else feeling similar. 

I took mife pill Thursday night. I thought I would be fine with this part and struggle with the 2nd set of pills, but I found this first pill to be a really emotional experience. Prior to taking it I had sore breaststroke (especially nipples), morning sickness to the point I was managing to eat a packet of ready salted crisps maybe once a day and lemon squash, twinges and pains in my pelvis due to stretching and growth etc. 

I was very upset Thursday but went to sleep, and when I woke up on Friday it was as if someone had turned the switch off for my pregnancy symptoms, which really threw me. I could drink coffee and eat some food and felt less tired almost immediately. 

I took the 4 miso pills vaginally Saturday morning and had already taken ibuprofen, paracetamol and codeine as directed. Putting the pills in vaginally was a little uncomfortable. I laid down so they wouldn't come out for about half an hour and felt cramping within 5-10 minutes noticeably - this felt like the start of my period honestly. Within half hour I had light bleeding and continuous cramping as well as lots of gas. Bleeding got heavier throughout the day and about 4 hours in I passed some large clots approx half the size of my palm (I'm a little lady with small hands!). Approximately 12-15 hours after taking the miso, I had some very intense cramps that I would say were on par with a bad period or early labour pains if you've had previous children. They eased within about 45 minutes, and I spent the weekend with my partner on the sofa in adult diapers doing lots of calming things and resting. I was absolutely exhausted ngl. I also passed another large clot on Tuesday about half the size of my palm after about 30 minutes of very intense cramps. Other than that, the cramps and pain were very tolerable and felt like my usual period would.

Bleeding continued for about 7 days without soaking pads and gradually lightening. I continued to have spotting (pink and orangey) for another 1-2 days which has since stopped.

The most surprising aspect has been the mood shifts in the week immediately after. I was teary without knowing why, and felt quite overwhelmed. This could have been hormonal or emotional I'm not too sure, but was SIGNIFICANT. 

This week we will do the pregnancy test with the MA kit to check that hormones are back to normal levels, but the process has been far less daunting and traumatic physically than I thought it would be, and after reading some horror stories on here about truly awful experiences of some poor people I wanted to share a slightly more positive/less horrific physical experience. 

Saying that, the emotional aspect has been horrible. This was a choice made out of practical considerations of having a baby in our circumstances currently, but has opened up a conversation about when we would like to have children, and how we will prepare for that moving forwards. The grief I have felt over this baby has been terrible, and at times felt absolutely crushing. My partner has been an absolute rock throughout this process and I couldn't have done it without him.

Hopefully this helps someone else panicking or worrying about the physical procedure ❤️

**FIVE**. Maura woke up. A big gulp of air. She was cuffed to an exposed pipe in the backyard of the Child’s house. She looked up. The Child stood over her with her knife.  
&nbsp;  
“How did you get my knife?”  
&nbsp;  
“I don’t want you to kill me.”  
&nbsp;  
Maura blinked as she tried to make sense of this. “Please give me the knife.” She uncuffed herself.  
&nbsp;  
“I don’t want you to kill me to keep me safe. That doesn’t make sense.” It had been two days since *3iSaaba* came. During that time the Child had been quiet. She hadn’t thought much of it; she had been quiet too.  
&nbsp;  
“I’m not going to let them take you.” Her breath was ragged now. “You don’t know what they’re capable of. If they came back I would do it again.”  
&nbsp;  
“*Astaghfirallah*. Then you can leave. You’re not my friend anymore.”  
&nbsp;  
The Child went back inside.  
&nbsp;  
She woke up the next morning to the Child cooking a can of spam. She’d fallen asleep on the couch, scared the *3iSaaba* would return. It wasn’t until she had seen the fires six kilometers off that she’d closed her eyes. She watched him. He put half the spam on a plate for her. He ate the rest from the can.  
&nbsp;  
“Thank you.”  
&nbsp;  
“My family wants you to leave.”  
&nbsp;  
“I’m sorry.”  
&nbsp;  
“No, you have to go.”  
&nbsp;  
“You can’t stay here, you’ll die.”  
&nbsp;  
“No, I watched you. I learned cooking and looking for things. You have to go.”  
&nbsp;  
“Come with me.”  
&nbsp;  
“This is where I live.”  
&nbsp;  
“It’s not safe. *3iSaaba* will find you and then–”  
&nbsp;  
“I’ll be alright. They get angry and that makes them weak. I don’t.”  
&nbsp;  
“Everyone gets it. Stop talking nonsense.”  
&nbsp;  
The Child left the room. He returned with a small, dusty camcorder. He turned it on and handed it to her. She could hear the Sound but the recording of it caused no reaction. Instead she saw herself cuffed to the storm drain. At first she was still like a corpse. The Sound cycled and she reanimated, her body dragged air into itself. Her veins bulged. Her eyes looked milky and red. She pulled against the drain, towards freedom. She whipped her head around, driven it seemed only by her senses and her rage. Whoever Maura was, was not here, was not this. 
“Maura?” A small voice she recognized as the Child called to her. The Woman turned to the recorder of the video and lunged at the camera. But she couldn’t reach the Child. Maura looked away as the Woman screamed in frustration.  
&nbsp;  
“No, look,” he said.  
&nbsp;  
The Child sat next to her. He watched alongside her.  
&nbsp;  
After a few minutes, the Sound ceased and with it the paroxysm. The Woman sat in a stupor now, exhausted. She was falling asleep. The camera turned then to the Child who filmed himself for a moment. He was the same. The Sound had not affected him. The video cut off.  
&nbsp;   
Maura collected herself. As a reflex she bit her palm. Hard. It was a new habit but useful. It brought her back to herself without noise, without time she did not have.  
&nbsp;  
“How? Did you ever...did the Sound ever change you?”  
&nbsp;  
“No.”  
&nbsp;  
“Did your family know? Did they tell anyone?”  
&nbsp;  
“They said there was no one left to tell.”  
&nbsp;  
“We need to get you to a hospital. You could–”  
&nbsp;  
“There are no working hospitals and there’s no way to get there anyway. That’s what my mom said.” The Child thought for a moment. “*Inshallah*, I will be alright.”  
&nbsp;  
He put her knife down on the coffee table. She set the camcorder down next to it.  
&nbsp;  
“No,” he said. “Take that too.”  
&nbsp;  
***
&nbsp;  
That night she watched the video on the camcorder of her metamorphosis again. She had spent the day in a hotel room in Souq Waqif, maybe hoping the Child would wander by and she could invent a reason to run into him.  
&nbsp;  
Maura noticed the time code on the video. The recording of her was twenty-seven minutes in. She rewound and pressed play from the beginning. The Child’s face filled up the screen. He was younger and sitting up in a hospital bed. His mother and older sister entered the hospital room carrying a cake. They sang in Arabic, and he smiled shyly as his mother set the cake down in front of him. His mother said something to the person recording, and the camera was set down. A man appeared in the frame now. His father. They began to eat and laugh and hug. The video stopped.  
&nbsp;      
It began again. The video now showed the house from a low vantage point as the Child ran through it greeting cousins, grandparents, aunts and uncles in quick succession. The camera stopped in the kitchen; his mother handed him food and sent him on his way. The scene then followed his father who picked him up, both in frame now for a kiss. Maura could see the dining room table set for a feast. The recording stopped. Maura’s Arabic wasn’t good enough to understand much of what was said, but she got one thing from the clips clearly: Malek.    
&nbsp;  
She pressed forward on the video, one eye on the low battery. Next was footage of the early days of the Sound. Malek looked a year older. The family was home. She could hear them speaking in hushed tones in the background as an emergency announcement blared from loudspeakers. Whoever was holding the camera opened the front door and exited to the front walkway. She could see Malek, his mother and sister, before catching a glimpse of anxious neighbors and cars stopped in the middle of the street, their drivers getting out to gawp at the sky. The camera followed their line of sight and zoomed in on the alien ship moving slowly overhead towards its final resting place over the gulf. Malek’s father recited a prayer. Then the Sound came. Someone far away screamed. Malek’s family ran inside, the camera set down roughly on its side while everyone scrambled to tie themselves.  
&nbsp;   
Maura fast forwarded a bit; she couldn’t see much. Someone picked up the camera and it recorded from a low angle again, framed on top by a fringe that she recognized from a tablecloth on the coffee table. The image trembled. She guessed Malek was holding the camera. He was hiding. The camera panned to his family—father, mother, sister. Each tied down and transforming. In their haste, they had left the front door open. Maura could see people running past the house now. One person looked in, but from their point of view could see no one and moved on. And then Malek said something. A small, “Oh, *la*.” Oh, no. Just a whisper. The door stood empty for a moment. Maura could hear Malek’s breath. A shadow inched across the threshold. The person was back, eyes darting and bright. This person—a man of about fifty—stood in the doorway vibrating with rage, ravenous. A killer under a spell. He entered the house and then a woman half his age entered behind him. The video cut off.  
&nbsp;   
When it came on again the video was inside a cage of some sort. The film jerked around as if in motion, and she could hear the squeak of wheels. A voice interrupted the recording, “How are you today little one?”  
&nbsp;  
“Good, ‘uncle’,” said the Child.  
&nbsp;  
“*Alhamdulillah*. I believe you are ready for an adventure, but first we will go to the masjid.”  
&nbsp;  
The Child laughed, “Yes, ‘uncle’.”  
&nbsp;  
Maura thought the voice belonged to a native Hindi speaker. They rolled along in silence as the video caught the deserted streets. And then the Sound came. The voice exclaimed in Hindi before commanding in English, “Pull down the tarp and don’t make a sound.” Malek poked two fingers through the blue plastic to keep recording. Maura sighed. She didn’t want to see any more. Her finger hovered over the fast forward button until she saw something from a nightmare. *Herself*. Maura watched as she crept into frame, open handcuffs swinging from one wrist. She seemed to look directly into the camera and moved towards it but then got distracted by the Hindi speaker. She turned and the camera followed. The Old Man with the cart. She saw him now defenseless, appalling, and straining at his binding as he tried to attack her. The Woman set upon the Old Man.   
&nbsp;     
The video cut off.  
&nbsp;  
***
&nbsp;  
She didn’t get out of bed the next day or the next. Nor did she bind herself. On the ninth day, she awoke with a gash the length of her index finger on her side. On the twentieth day, she awoke on scaffolding five stories high. The falcon sounded softly near her head. She turned to it as she came to. If she had turned the other way, she would have fallen to her death. It was a week after that that Malek stood over her as she woke up.  
&nbsp;   		
“Batman? How did you find me?”  
&nbsp;  
“You were screaming.”  
&nbsp;  
She laughed, then shook her head. “I thought you were at home with your family.”  
&nbsp;  
“I was looking for you. I saw you sometimes.” He paused. “You stopped binding yourself.”  
&nbsp;  
She nodded.  
&nbsp;  
“But then you started again.”  
&nbsp;  
“Yes.”  
&nbsp;  
“We should go, I think. We should leave the city.”  
&nbsp;  
She shook her head. “I can’t keep you safe. I can’t even keep myself safe. Eventually *3iSaaba* will find us. Or some other gang or the Sound…” She remembered then what she had seen on the camcorder, what she had done.  
&nbsp;    
It was his turn to nod. “I forgive you.”  
&nbsp;  
    
***
&nbsp;  
**EPILOGUE**. The spaceship hung over the water, still shimmering. It appeared to move, leisurely, toward land. The falcon watched from atop a palm tree on the corniche. It cocked its head to one side, then the other. A bird called in the distance. The falcon responded. And then like all the other birds in the city, it took off in flight.  
&nbsp;  
Maura and Malek made their way down a dune on camelback and were in a valley thirty kilometers outside of Doha when she saw the flash, followed by the boom of an explosion. She covered her eyes as sand whipped by them. Disoriented, the camel began to kneel. She let it. They sat for a moment. “Stay here,” she said. “I’ll be right back.”  
&nbsp;  
Maura climbed the dune, peeking just her head out over the top. A blue-gray light emanated from the spaceship, which now hovered over land. Everything within a kilometer of the city was gone. She watched as debris rose in a giant mushroom cloud above where the city once lay. The blue-gray light stopped, and the ship moved back towards its harbor over the gulf.  
&nbsp;  
She crawled back down the dune. She got on the camel, which had calmed and was ready to walk again.  
&nbsp;  
“What happened?”  
&nbsp;  
“I don’t know.”  
&nbsp;  
At the top of the next dune, Malek turned and looked. She didn’t stop him. He said nothing and they continued on in silence.  
&nbsp;  

***
&nbsp;  
She woke up that night to find him staring into the dying fire. “Are you cold?” She could see her breath cloud as she said this and threw more dung onto the fire.  
&nbsp;  
“What happens if the Sound comes when we’re out here.”  
&nbsp;  
“Then I cover my eyes with my headscarf and handcuff my arms behind my back. And you run.” This answer seemed to satisfy him, but he didn’t lie back down. She sat across from him and wondered if he was thinking about his family.  
&nbsp;  
“Why did they burn the city?”  
&nbsp;  
“I don’t know. Someone told me a similar attack occurred in Helsinki. But the networks went down the same day, only hours later. It wasn’t confirmed. Do you remember that day?”
He nodded.  
&nbsp;  
“I was in Ms. Robertson’s class. We were going to the book fair and the lights went out. We were only supposed to get one book, but Ms. Robertson let us have two. School ended early that day. It was the last day we had school. Ms. Robertson looked sad and told us to be brave.” He stared into the flames. “People aren’t the scariest thing though.”  
&nbsp;  
“Oh. What’s the scariest thing?”  
&nbsp;  
“Them.” He whispered. “I saw one walking by itself.”  
&nbsp;  
Maura turned to face Malek.  
&nbsp;  
“You saw one?”  
&nbsp;  
“Yes. Walking. During the Sound.”  
&nbsp;  
“What did it look like?”  
&nbsp;  
“It was tall and skinny and changed shapes like that.” Malek pointed to the ship in the distance. “But I could tell it was walking. It copies us, I think.”  
&nbsp;  
“Why do you say that?”  
&nbsp;  
“I don’t know. It was like it was watching.”  
&nbsp;  
“But when? When was this?”  
&nbsp;  
Malek shrugged. “When the Sound came right before the playground got broken. And again today.”
Maura felt a chill go through her. “Did it see you?”  
&nbsp;  
“I think...yes.”  
&nbsp;  
Maura sat back trying to understand. She turned and looked back at the city on fire. They said a prayer for his family and for hers; Malek added some words for *3iSaaba* too. She made him lie down again and in a few moments he fell asleep. At dawn, they got back on the camel and continued on and on across the desert.  
&nbsp;

1lh5erp,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1lh5erp/ok_but_how_do_yall_even_drink_water/,Ok but how do ya'll even drink water?,"This is a serious question. I crave water after saunas or if I had lots of exercise (sugary drinks in that context are too much if I'm super active as well as junk food)
But in a normal, every day context, I'm not constantly in a sauna or working out. In fact, I can't do hardly any workouts right now because of some medical problems I have atm. Besides walking, which doesnt make me crave water. At my height, age, and weight, I should be drinking (basic general estimate including all liquids from foods and other beverages) 91 oz of liquid a day. With a minimum baseline of  69oz (which does not facilitate the proper healing I need truely for my medical problems). 

I have a disgust for drinking water with food. The water after drinking food tastes like the food randomly, no matter how hard I try to not backwash or do anything. I have to have something with flavor and I've found that the ""how to drink water for people that drink water"" techniques dont help me in this instance. For example, one techniques was to get a water bottle with an infusion center for fruits or veggies to turn water into cucumer or strawberry water etc, which doesn't get rid of the taste of food and also that takes two extra steps that discourages me from doing it.

I also have a disgust for drinking water after brushing my teeth. Despite having autism friendly toothpaste with no foam and no flavor, I find that even after an hour I really dont like to as I feel like I'm drinking or washing my toothpaste away... Ya, i know.
I have tried to work around this by drinking water before brushing my teeth, but I've found that if I don't immediately brush my teeth right after waking up, I won't because of my autism. I also get grossed out by the idea of prepping a water bottle in my bathroom near my toothbrush as a reminder because its in my bathroom.

I also don't like to drink water after I ate, even several hours after. Why would I eat something so delicious even at the risk of it being unhealthy or me gaining weight if I can't taste the flavor in my mouth after? People that eat mints after meals, for example, perplex me so much.

I might have some water to take supplements before bed or a few sips here and there. I've tried to do the ten gulp rule to increase it, and it's worked relative to drinking no water.. I maybe drink from 8oz-16.9 a day. I also drink a grande cup of iced coffee, around 16oz, and a body armor or two a day at 12fl oz each body armor (I like how many vitamins and minerals are in them and the coconut water but are still 21g of sugar each body armor)

I have also tried eliminating sugar in order to make water taste delicious by comparison, but no dice. Turns out one of the things with autism is I can't connect the dots between my throat being dry and that I should drink water. Similar to how I have a full bladder and I don't connect that with that I should go to the restroom. And it doesnt address the disgust from various other contexts I talked about in earlier paragraphs. I'll drink 8oz if I had trouble pooping or if I feel cramps near my stomach or kidneys and that's it.

I know that drinking the 90-100 oz of water would help me and my current medical conditions, but with my average water intake a day being 6-16 oz of water, it just seems so far away and like I'll never get there. How did you guys do it?",1,1750536039.0,autism,2,1.0,False

1lh5dpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1lh5dpo/well_it_happened_after_5_years_and_200_5_star/,"Well, it happened. After 5 years and 200+ 5 star ratings, a complaining guest demanding a refund.","We have two Airbnb units on our 4 unit property. We live in one unit, our daughter/SIL/grandaughter in the other.

One unit is a very large (1400sq ft)  loft studio with 20' ceilings, skylights, 360 windows, which we walled off a small bedroom/office. I am not exaggerating when I say it's an amazing space. Koa wood floors, new teak and koa furniture, large king size bed overlooking our garden,  a river gorge and rainforest. A large private lanai overlooking the same.  Ofuro tubs in the large bathroom. Access to hot tub, sauna, beach equipment, bikes. We leave a welcome basket of local coffee, chocolate, tropical fruit from our garden. We have not only gotten 5s, the reviews are often over the top. In a semi-rural area, but 10 minutes from town. The rate ranges from 90-150 (far cheaper than hotels, competitive for STR)

I'm saying all this because yesterday we got a list of complaints from a new guest (2 people) at 8:30am (they checked in at 9pm the night before), they literally went through the house as soon as they could to find whatever they could to complain about. Most of which they hadn't even had a moment to use.

\* the hot tub is unusable. ""It would take all day to heat up""  
\* a beach umbrella is unusable and they were hoping to go to the beach  
\* a beach chair has a metal piece protruding  
\* the sauna is not a steam sauna  
\* the ofuro tubs are not filled with water  
\* the ice maker is not working  
\* the ocean view is only ""peekaboo"" from the kitchen.  
\* the pots and pans have scratches

I wrote a response.  
\*I reminded them we keep the hot tub at '92 (electricity rates are 4x national average) and that guests just need to give us notice they'd like to use it and in an hour or so, it can be at 100-104. We require notice not only to heat up, but because it's a shared hot tub. That is mentioned in the listing, in the welcome folder AND at the hot tub. (anyway, when did they even have time to use it!?.. use hours are clearly stated as 10:30am and to 10:30pm)  
\*There are five beach umbrellas. They found one that wasn't working properly. The other four work and two are brand new and as yet unused.  
\* There are six beach chairs. all work, and 3 are brand new and unused.  
\* The sauna is clearly listed as a DRY sauna  
\* The Ofuro tubs take all of 15-20 minutes to fill. Leaving water in them is unsanitary  
\* As written in the welcome book, the ice maker does not work (and repair isn't possible), but there are 4 ice cube trays.  
\* We do not and have never advertised an ocean view because even ""Peekaboo"" is an overstatement.  
\* There are two pans with small scratches on the bottom (I just checked) and they work great.

I explained these but since they are unhappy I offered a refund of cleaning fee and refund of the remaining 3 nights if they cancel and leave by 2pm.

They responded that they would take the cleaning fee refund but would rather not leave. (ETA.. their only response to the line items was that they needed far more ice than four ice cube trays could do since they were watching soccer games in the hot sun. I wanted to write and say... then go to the grocery store for bags of ice. I didn't.)

We are bracing ourselves for more complaints when they check out and a demand for further refund... and our first bad review. We had this happen on the other unit a few years ago (twice) lots of minor or non-complaints and then demand of refund at the end. One threatened to leave bad review. That review was taken down.

1lh5d1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lh5d1c/coming_out_of_depression_and_quitting_coffee/,Coming out of depression (and quitting coffee helped more than I expected),"I've been dealing with depression for a while now. It's not anything dramatic—just that heavy, slow kind where you lose interest in everything, and every day feels like you're dragging a boulder uphill. My go-to coping mechanism? Coffee. Way too much of it. I convinced myself it was helping, but honestly, I was just using it to cover up how drained I felt. I was downing 5+ cups a day, at the very least.

It kept me wired and restless, but I wasn’t really functional. My sleep was terrible, anxiety was through the roof, and I was always crashing by the afternoon. Deep down, I knew it wasn’t doing me any favors, but quitting felt like an impossible task.

A few months back, while trying to get my life back on track (therapy, walking, eating real meals, you know, the basics), I decided to cut out caffeine. and learned about app called NOCAF that helps you gradually reduce your caffeine intake. Honestly, it turned out to be more helpful than I thought. It tracks how much you’re drinking, gives you little nudges to taper off, and the reminders were genuinely useful when I felt tempted to give in.

The first few days were rough, not gonna lie—headaches, brain fog, the usual suspects. But after a couple of weeks, I noticed something surprising: I was feeling less anxious. My energy levels were more stable. And I could actually fall asleep without tossing and turning for hours.

Quitting caffeine didn’t magically fix my depression, but it definitely took away one of the things that was making it worse. And getting even a bit of mental clarity helped me stick to the other positive changes I was trying to make.

Just wanted to share that. Remember, you’re not alone.

1lh5cik,https://www.reddit.com/r/TotalHipReplacement/comments/1lh5cik/day_25_lathr/,Day 2-5  LATHR,"Well, I figured I’d wait a bit so I had a lot to tell. I don’t have a lot to tell. Day 2-5 have been pretty unremarkable. Taking that first shower Day 2 was absolutely glorious. I think most of us will agree a hot shower can turn you into a functioning human being again. 

The appetite has been pretty non-existent but is starting to come back slowly. I had pizza from a local place last night (Day 4) and it’s the first thing that really excited my taste buds. Everything else was like, “here’s hoping this will make a turd because otherwise I have zero interest in it.” Coffee each morning with the mixed in MiraLax has been fine. Gatorade has been fine. I had the little lady procure some Ensure so I was getting some type of nutrition. The milk chocolate flavor is good. Dark chocolate flavor works but not as good as the MC. As for the BMs, they are like little rabbit turds but, they are present. (Yes, it’s likely TMI but, there are those that need/want to know what to expect.)

Ice has been my friend (the cold, solid state of water not the “other”) as it has been with all of my post-op recoveries. I don’t think you can get enough of your whole leg iced. I noticed today I’m pretty swollen right below my butt cheek. So, Instead of using the Breg Polar Care Wave hip wrap as a wrap, I’ve been sitting on it with a second ice pack on the top of my leg from the top of my shorts to my knee. 

The bruising showed its head yesterday (Day 4) in a most brilliant way. The bruise from my incision to my inner thigh is very rectangular and I’m guessing has much to do with the retractor they used there. The bruise from my incision outward is more widespread from basically mid cheek to maybe half way to my knee, maybe less.

Today (Day 5) I decided to do without the Oxy and see how I do. Didn’t really feel like I was needing it but, I sure didn’t want to have to chase the pain with a fresh bionic leg. So, I’m going to take one tonight before going to sleep just to give me that little extra push toward the sandman. I also discarded the walker for most of my activities. I likely could have transitioned to the cane a day or two ago but figured let’s play it safe. The walker kept my feet shoulder width and reminded me not to do something stupid because I was feeling good. I think I’ll keep it next to the bed for getting up at night for the trip to the bathroom. The walker also helped with my self-confidence. Let’s face it, we’ve all been in pain, know what they just did to us and are a bit apprehensive about full weight bearing and such. At least I sure was. 

I also have quit using the yoga strap to get my foot/leg down off the foot rest. It’s still helpful getting it on top of the foot rest but is getting much easier to do that as well. 

As for walking, I’m not sure how you walk for 5-10 minutes every hour and keep between 500-750 steps daily. Day 1 - 1093; Day 2 - 901; Day 3 - 911; Day 4 - 1438; Today I’m already at 663. between bathroom breaks, going to shower, head to the bedroom for meds, I could easily do the 750 without hourly walks.

Anyway, for not having much, that was well, a lot. As you can see, I’m bored. Terribly bored. But, Job #1 is to heal and that is what I’m doing. Physically on the couch and mentally here with y’all. I hope this helps someone. I know not everyone will experience what I have. I’m not posting to brag or to make someone else feel bd. Just putting my experience out there so some of the questions you have but don’t know you have until you have them can get answered. Oh, like how do you dry off your lower leg if you can’t bend down…well, twirl the towel like you were going to snap someone’s butt with it and use it that way. Towel is more rigid and it make it easier to control. I even asked how and no one seemed to have an answer.

Anyway, good luck to you all. Remember, we aren’t old, we were just broken.

1lh54ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/CervicalCancer/comments/1lh54ss/cone_procedure_post_surgery_recovery_questions/,Cone procedure post surgery recovery questions.,"I had my cone biopsy back on May 30th. It rupture 4 days post surgery and was hemorrhaging after taking a poop. I was admitted to the OR and they did a repair. I’ll be 3 weeks post surgery this coming Tuesday. I went back to work a week after with restriction since I work in a factory 10 hrs standing Monday through Thursday and sometimes Friday, that includes no heavy lifting, taking 5 minute breaks per hr, no bending or squatting. So my period is supposed to come this week, I was told it was gonna be delayed or having heavy bleeding and cramping. 

So I started having mild cramping 3 days, then yesterday my cramping was still mild and getting a little bit stronger when I walk. I had the urge to poop when I sat down on the toilet I was having a hard time pooping but I’m not constipated. I started passing super soft stools, I wasn’t even pushing but my anus hurt a little. I’ve been pooping normal and drinking plenty of water and it’s soft. I don’t drink coffee nor coke. Just plain water. Been eating fruits and vegetables. Taking care of myself because I’m scared my incision is gonna rupture again. I want to add before 
I went the restroom, I felt like something lowering like is trying to come out but once I sat down on the toilet I felt it pushing back up (it was felt on my abdomen like my cervix). Got scared tbh.

So I called my OBYN  office with the following questions:

1- if my period is going to be delayed, how many days or weeks or months before I being to get worried because I’m scared I could have cervical stenosis. (Nurse said she didn’t know)

2- what was that feeling like something is coming down, it was felt on my abdomen and when I sat down it was literally pushed back up. (Nurse didn’t know)

Nurse said she would contact my dr since she’s out of office. She called me back 15 minutes later just saying that my Dr prescribed me 2 different antibiotics: Metronidazole and Amoxicillin. I don’t have discharge, no fever, nothing. Just the pain like cramping. 

My question is, has anyone experienced any of this? They did told me if the pain gets worst to go to the ER. I do still have mild cramping but nothing too serious. I do get cramps before my period and I’m even having breakouts on my face. It’s just I’m almost 3 weeks post surgery and I have read the majority of the people has had gone through cone biopsy they’re feeling great after 2-3 weeks post surgery. I know everyone is different but I would love if someone would give me some information about maybe going through the same thing and if it’s going to go away. Did everything went back to normal after the 6 weeks mark? I’m scared. ",1,1750535303.0,CervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

1lh51zv,https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/j-mascis/j-mascis-daytrotter-session-jun-6-2011,"J Mascis - Daytrotter Session (Jun 6, 2011)",">The news came in today that Jack Kevorkian had died. After being sick for some time, Dr. Death, as he was nicknamed, recently fell considerably more ill and finally succumbed to the complications of pneumonia and old age. He, better than most people, understood that death comes and that there’s a way to get to it quicker than just waiting for it. He insisted, for over 20 years, that he provided a service to those whose quality of life was nothing like they wanted it to be, suffering through chronic and only worsening diseases. One of Kevorkian’s attorneys spoke on National Public Radio today and addressed a point that most people thought to be a hypocritical one in terms of the man and what he believed. He never took his own life, even when he knew that he was only getting closer to the end. He never took his own life, even when his health tumbled off the edge and became something of an ugly blotch, a fragment of the poor thing that it used to be – suddenly a grotesque failure of its former self. He never took his own life, the attorney reasoned, because everyone meets death in a different and personal way. Some people greet it with an extended hand and others let it find them, wherever they’re hiding because no matter their condition, they like it here and they’re going to hang around as long as they possibly can.

>J. Mascis, famously known as the lead singer and guitarist for the Massachusetts group Dinosaur Jr., is a man we think would go ahead and let the end find him, wherever he is. Though he sings about loneliness and despair the way that someone would sing about a lover, he also seems to have a lot at stake down here still. Wanting to be alone is different than wanting to be dead. He simply seeks the peace of mind, that quiet that has a friend up in his head with all of the buzzing that must be the hum that puts him to sleep at night – those different shades of distortion that come to him like Mr. Sandman.

>Mascis’ new solo album, “Several Shades of Why,” is an ode to the glory of finding that place where you don’t have to bother with the cumbrances of other people’s fuck-ups and notions, where you’re the only one who can say what’s going to be done with your time. He cherishes his ability to just lock himself away in a room, without another soul around, and just be there with his solitude. It is him. It’s his dream place. Or his pipe dream place. He sings about the universal temporariness of everything – how nothing sticks around and that’s okay. The theme of solitary passions and lives is continual throughout the album and yet, Mascis rarely sounds bummed about what he’s made for himself. “Alone,” a song that could be the cornerstone for this collection of sleepy, but loud songs, comes to us as a beautiful examination of what he needs out of life. It’s not much. He could probably eat the same thing every day, where the same tee-shirt, go to the same places, see or not see the same people and if the pattern and the ritual were there – if he was able to retreat back to where he knows will be as non-crowded as he left it – he could stay like that forever. He could remain a man who enjoys his morning coffee and whatever else happens that day. He could live as long as the fates and the mutating cells will allow. He will let death come for him. He sings on Edie Brickell’s “Circle,” “I quit/I give up/Nothing’s good enough for anybody else/It seems/Being alone’s the best way to be/When I’m by myself, it’s the best way to be,” and it’s kind of hard to disagree with the guy.",3,1750535088.0,dinosaurjr,0,1.0,False

I don't bring up specific childhood experiences in this because he has an awful habit of denying my memories. But this is the result of a lifelong smorgasbord of narcissistic behavior, culminating with him standing me up on my college graduation and then reaching out to me on my birthday about a month and a half later as if nothing happened. 

---

I need to clear some things up before whatever story you're telling yourself about why I'm not communicating with you gets out of hand. The best thing you could’ve given me for my birthday was an honest apology, dad. Not only did you stand me up on graduation, but you chose to ignore it completely.
I made a point to tell you ahead of graduation that if you didn’t show up for anything short of your father dying, it would damage our relationship. And that’s exactly what is happening here. You didn’t come, and worse, you said nothing. And as a result, I'm trying to decide where you fit in my life as an adult. 

I also want you to know that I was a fucking wreck the week leading up to my graduation because I knew what was about to happen. You're so predictable in your responses to things that you either don't want to, or can't handle, that I knew I wouldn't see you. But what I can't wrap my head around is WHY. Why did you ignore everything I said? Do you even remember why this started in the first place? When did you decide that burying your head in the sand was easier than owning up to your mistakes? Especially when your own parents; your dying father, still managed to acknowledge my graduation, send a card, and check in on me.

Now, since you chose to not attend my graduation, let me tell you how that day went. I woke up and put on a gorgeous blue dress that Mikey's mom helped me pick out. I went upstairs and was handed a cup of coffee by my best friend who drove all the way from Indiana to be there for me. After I finished my coffee, his wife, who also came, helped me curl my hair. Once I was finished with that, I put on a pair of earrings that David helped me pick out because he couldn't be there. Just before we left, I put on my graduation gown and Trevor helped me pin my stole and honor cords in place. Then after Mikey drove me down to the events center, I met up with Mom in the bathroom who helped me pin my graduation cap into place using bobby pins from her own hair because I forgot mine. The ceremony began, I found my seat next to my friends, and I listened to our commencement speaker as she asked us to stand, look out to the crowd, and wave to the people who had shown up, who had supported us, who had seen us through every part of our journey. 

And when I looked out into that crowd, I knew I wouldn't see you. 

There was a time where you used to take pride in my success, you made it clear to me growing up that anything I did reflected back on you and I always thought that so long as I did good things, things that made you proud, you'd show up for me. I banked on that for years and constantly chased the warmth of you being there for me. But as I got older, the warmth gradually faded and I could never understand why. But I think I get it now. You once told me that I can’t be proud of people, because pride implies ownership. So let me ask you plainly: now that you don’t feel like you “own” me, do you just not see a reason to be proud anymore?

That's probably a hard question for you to answer, let alone swallow and I'm sorry for that. But as I said, I know you. I know your habits, tendencies and patterns. And I know that that is a question that you need to think long and hard about, especially given the fact that you, in your own words, have been attempting to reflect on your role you play in the lives of others. Answer it, or don't. But it's out there now that that is how I see you and interpret you. My achievements no longer benefit you; so that must mean they're no longer important to you. 

I made peace with the fact that you're a narcissist a long time ago. I read the books. I listened to the experts. I talked to others who shared similar experiences. I went to the support groups. I did everything I could to understand YOU. To figure out how to talk to you, engage you, diffuse you, support you, love you, placate you. And in all of that. I still maintained my view that you didn't know any better, that you were blameless, that this is your first time being alive too and you couldn't possibly have all the answers. I made apologies for you for years. I never let myself become apoplectic towards you because I knew I would sooner rip out my own teeth, lest my rage consume my kindness. 

But I turned 26 yesterday, the last vestige of the power you held over me snuffed out. And don't try to kid yourself by saying you never held my health insurance over me, I have plenty of texts screenshotted where you threatened to take me off the plan unless I complied with whatever you were incandescent about that week. I've walked on eggshells around you for long enough. I'm tired of holding my tongue. I'm tired of being the bigger person when you do and say things that are clearly meant to hurt me and twist the knife for good measure. Everyone that is critical to me in my life has seen the way you treat me, they have read the texts, overheard the phone calls, listened to the voice memos, seen the lack of engagement, and held me in the aftermath of each ; and yet, in all of this. I am usually still the one who makes apologies for you and tries to tell people it's not as bad as it seems, while they look on in horror. 

So this is where we are now. I’m not writing this for a fight. I’m not interested in your defense or whatever version of this story you’ve rehearsed to make it easier to live with. I’m writing this because I’m done leaving things unsaid just to protect the peace. I needed you to know how deeply your choices have hurt me, not just in missing graduation, but in ALL the moments that built up to it, and in the deafening silence that followed. Because if you really are reflecting on who you’ve been, being honest with yourself about your role in the lives of others, then I hope you sit with this. But no matter what you choose do with it, I’ll be moving forward, and for once, you can be the one who has to decide what to do with the weight of someone else's words cutting you down.

I am a novice in the espresso world, looking to buy a fully automated espresso machine, however, I am a bit lost with the amount of possibilities that exist out there.

To me, the important features are:

* Espresso Quality
* Easy of use, i.e., just press the espresso button
* Adjust espresso intensity

I am not interested into other features, such as manual or automated Milk Frother, making capuccinos, etc.

My main goal and ideal usage for the machine, is to just put the coffee beans, adjust the intensity that I want the espresso, and press a button.

I have recently bought the Philips Baristina Automatic Espresso Machine but it ended up being a very disappointing experience, probably had some defect since water would spill all over the place, and I had to return it.

So this is a different query from the usual posts on this sub. Iam traveling to Kochi in 2 weeks and wanted to stock up on coffee syrups from Amazon India. 
I saw some interesting flavors and brands. Does anyone have any experience with GOOD & MOORE or carmine or Da Vinci. 
I don't want to buy Monin as I have it here in the country I live in and it's okay. 
I was especially intrigued with the sugar free options in the above mentioned syrups.

I’m exhausted, I can’t sleep at night and I forget to eat and even drink water. My husband has been a wonderful helper, but he needs to study for his school and is busy at times. 

All that to preface this: my MIL came in a few days ago from another state and is staying over at our place. She’s aware of all I just said. She hasn’t helped at all in the house, and I actually feel like I have a guest over that I need to cater for (which I’m not, but feel that it’s the expectation). I wouldn’t feel so upset if she helped at all, maybe making some eggs for breakfast, coffee, asking if we need any help, anything. She just sits there and holds the baby  and comments on how she thinks we should do x and y differently. She constantly feels like the baby is cold, and comments on how she needs more layers or a blanket, and wrapped my baby in the thickest blanket and took her out to 90 degree weather all wrapped up, which made me so mad. I just ignore it, but it is so hard to. I expected some help, as I’m still recovering, and I am so annoyed at all this. I guess I just needed to vent. I can’t say anything to my husband because I don’t want to hurt his feelings or make him feel like I don’t welcome his family, but it’s just so frustrating. ",6,1750534504.0,beyondthebump,4,1.0,False

1lh4tzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lh4tzr/i_took_a_job_at_a_strange_film_studio_theyre_not/,I Took a Job at a Strange Film Studio. They’re Not Just Making Movies [part 1],"I’d been out of work for over a year.

At first, I told myself it was just a rough patch. A dry season. Everyone goes through them, right? I sent out résumés like flares into the dark. No replies. No interviews. Just the occasional automated rejection that landed in my inbox like a death knell. But as the weeks crawled by, then months, the silence took on weight. Heavier. Meaner. Every résumé I sent felt smaller than the last. Like a paper boat tossed into a black sea.

I’d come out of film school starry-eyed and full of fire, convinced I was destined for something bigger. I wanted to make something that mattered. Something people would remember. I wanted to carve my name into the bones of cinema history. Movies were always more than entertainment to me. They were sacred.

I grew up on the floor in front of a flickering TV, curled up next to my brother with a blanket and a bowl of popcorn too big for our arms. Silly movies at first, but when I got older my brother introduced me to the world of true cinema as he used to put it. Sunday matinees turned into nighttime marathons. Spielberg. Carpenter. Kubrick. Even the weird Lynch stuff that made us laugh before it started to terrify us.

After my brother passed, I clung to film even harder. Editing, writing, shooting short scenes with borrowed gear. Grief turned into drive. It felt like the only way to keep him with me—by chasing the dreams we used to share in the dark.

But dreams are expensive. And idealism only pays in heartache.

Instead, I found myself cutting together strangers' wedding reels for cash—watching hours of champagne toasts and choreographed dances while feeling like a ghost pressing his face against the glass of a world he couldn’t enter.

By month three of unemployment, I was bleeding savings. By month six, I was pawning gear like heirlooms—my LED kit, my camera dolly, even the Super 8 I promised myself I’d keep forever. That one hurt the most. It was the camera I used to shoot our first home movie, the one where we made our backyard look like the end of the world.

That reel's probably in a box somewhere now. Dusty. Forgotten.

Kind of how I started to feel like.

Eventually, I stopped hearing back from job applications altogether. Not even rejections—just that sickly void of nothing. The kind of silence that feels personal.

I wasn’t a filmmaker anymore.

I was someone who used to talk about film the way other people talk about religion.

And then I found it.

A listing buried deep in a job site I didn’t even remember bookmarking.

Every listing on the site was for something creative—screenwriters, editors, set designers, concept artists, actors. But the jobs weren’t posted by companies. Just… names. Vague, sometimes poetic, sometimes deranged. “Seeking sculptor of memory.” “Actor wanted, must be comfortable with going the extra mile.” “Sound designer needed for memory reenactment (unpaid).”

Most of the listings read like either performance art or elaborate pranks. Like they’d been written by lunatics, or theater kids on absinthe.

But still—there was something about it. Something sincere under all the madness.

The listing that caught my eye simply read:

**CREATIVE ASSISTANT WANTED – FILM INDUSTRY. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. MUST BE WILLING TO GO THE DISTANCE FOR TRUE ART.**

I stared at the screen longer than I’d like to admit. It was a small local movie company that I had never heard about. Which was odd, because I thought I knew just about everything there was to know about the local scene. That line—*go the distance for true art*—clung to something deep in me. It was pompous, dramatic… and weirdly honest.

I almost clicked away.

I hovered over the tab, ready to close it out, maybe refresh Indeed again, look for another barista job I wouldn’t get called back for. But then I thought about all the nights I’d sat alone watching Tarkovsky films with frozen pizza and debt notices, all the half-finished screenplays on my hard drive no one would ever read.

So I clicked “Apply.”

I gave it my all on this. I made a personal resume and a motivated application that went into details about my passion for films, about my willingness to go the distance for true art.

Then I hit send.

Two days later, I got a reply.

One line.

*We’d like to meet you.*

Attached: an address to a warehouse space on the edge of town.

Intrigued by the sheer weirdness of it all, I decided to give it a try.

The building didn’t look like a studio. Not from the outside. More like an abandoned office block tucked behind a shuttered hardware store and an old coin laundry. The kind of place you’d expect to find leaking pipes, flickering lights, and mice—not filmmakers.

I stepped inside, and the air hit me immediately—cold and damp, tinged with something chemical and metallic, like old developer fluid or blood on copper. The lobby was mostly empty, save for a dead plant in the corner and a buzzing overhead light that looked like it might shake loose from the ceiling at any second.

A woman in all black—slim, pale, clipboard clutched tight to her chest—emerged from behind a narrow door without making a sound. Her smile was polite, but her eyes weren’t smiling. “Follow me,” she said.

The hallway she led me down was too quiet. Carpet muffled every step. Somewhere deep in the building, I thought I heard someone singing—slow, off-key, and childlike—but the sound vanished as quickly as it came.

She led me into a narrow room with a folding table and three chairs, one of which I was clearly meant to take. Two people already sat across from it. A man and a woman. Late forties, maybe. Sharp clothes. Hollow faces. They looked exactly how you’d expect indie film producers to look—if someone had described them to a sculptor who’d never met a human being before.

Everything about them was a little *off.* Their hair too perfect. Their smiles too tight. Their eyes too wide and wet, like they hadn’t blinked in a while.

“Thank you for coming,” the man said. His voice was deep and slow, like he was choosing each word from a locked drawer.

The woman nodded and slid a piece of paper toward me—blank. “We won’t need your résumé,” she said. “We’re not looking for experience. Just *conviction*.”

The questions started normally enough. “What’s your favorite film?” “What kind of stories do you want to tell?” “What directors inspire you?”

I answered the best I could, though I felt stupid halfway through. Like the questions weren’t really for information—they were watching how I answered, not what I said. Studying my mouth. My eyes. My posture.

Then the questions started to shift.

“Have you ever cried during a film? What scene? What did it take from you?”

“Have you ever watched someone die? What color were their eyes at the end?”

“Do you believe pain can be beautiful?”

Their voices never rose. The woman took notes in long, looping strokes. The man leaned in slightly every time I hesitated. I was sweating, but I couldn’t tell if it was from heat or fear.

Then came the question that finally lodged in my gut:

**“What is the worst thing that ever happened to you?”**

Silence followed.

They both leaned back in unison, like snakes waiting for a heartbeat to falter.

I stared down at my hands. My mouth opened, and I told them. About my brother. About the hospital. About the last time I saw his face. I don’t know why I said it. It spilled out of me like a confession I didn’t know I was holding.

The woman didn’t blink.

The man smiled.

Not kindly.

But like he’d just tasted something sweet.

“Thank you,” the woman said softly. “You’ve shown us you’re capable of truth.”

I left the room shaken. I should have walked away. But I didn’t.

Something about the way they listened—how they hung on every word—it stirred something. Shame, maybe. Or curiosity. Or a darker impulse I didn’t want to name.

By the next morning, I’d accepted the job.

My first day was the following Monday. I was nervous, but also excited. The warehouse looked different in daylight. Less ominous, somehow—like a stage set after the audience has gone home. But the moment I stepped inside, that illusion peeled away.

The place was deeper than I remembered.

Beyond the main hallway, the warehouse split into corridors that made no architectural sense—one curved subtly, disorientingly, and another led to a dead end that didn’t appear to match the building’s footprint from the outside. The air smelled like dust, paint thinner, and something faintly metallic.

People moved throughout the space—actors and staff, I assumed—but none of them spoke to me. A woman in a moth-eaten wedding dress stood barefoot in a corner, weeping into her hands. I turned to see if a camera crew was nearby, but there was no one filming. In another room, I heard a guttural scream—raw and too long—and when I stepped in, a young man sat cross-legged on the floor, laughing and crying at once, as though he couldn’t remember which came first.

No one stopped him. No one even looked concerned.

Props and costumes were scattered across open tables and racks. I passed a mannequin head painted entirely black with human teeth glued along the jawline. A giant papier-mâché bird costume hung from the ceiling like a hanged man. One room was full of shoes. Hundreds of mismatched shoes, sorted by size and style, none of them looking like they’d ever been worn on camera.

In the hallway outside the black box studio, I passed a door secured with a rusted padlock. Behind it, something thumped—slow and rhythmic, like someone pacing. Or… something heavier. A sound that didn’t belong in any building, let alone one pretending to be a film studio.

I paused. The sound stopped. When I leaned in, I could swear I heard breathing—wet, deliberate, just on the other side of the door.

Then, a sharp knock. *Once.*

I backed away. Fast.

No one else reacted. A man walked by wearing a clear plastic mask smeared with fake blood, holding a VHS tape labeled **DREAM FOOTAGE 6B**. He looked at me. Winked. Then vanished around the corner.

Before I could ask questions, one of the men from the interview approached. The one in the turtleneck.

“You’re here. Good. Come.”

He led me down a long corridor. Halfway through, he paused at a rusted metal door with a strip of yellow tape across it.

“Never go in here,” he said casually, as if he were pointing out a mop closet. “That space is... sensitive.”

I nodded. I didn’t bother asking.

We entered a small black-box studio. Minimal lighting. An ancient camera setup that looked like it had been pulled from a forgotten film set in Europe. In the center of the room stood a crude living room mock-up: couch, lamp, cheap framed photos. A young actor sat slumped in the middle, hands trembling, eyes red.

The director looked at me. “You’ll assist today.”

I blinked. “Doing what?”

He handed me a script. It was one page long.

**Scene 4: The Moment of Loss**

A man receives news that his older brother has died in a hit-and-run. The man collapses. He screams. He does not stop screaming.

I felt my breath catch in my throat.

“This—this is exactly like what I told you in the interview,” I said.

The man in the turtleneck nodded. “Yes. That’s why we chose this scene.”

My mouth went dry. “You’re using what I said.”

“No,” he said, voice calm. “We’re *honoring* it. This is what real art demands. Pain must be given shape, or it rots. You’re the only one who can help us make this moment real.”

I wanted to argue. I wanted to walk out. But I didn’t. I needed this job. I needed *something* to matter again.

So I helped. I gave notes. I coached the actor on how the grief hits in waves, how your body doesn’t know what to do—how your hands twitch like they’re searching for something to hold onto.

And when he collapsed on the fake carpet, sobbing so hard his voice cracked, it felt... real.

Too real.

I watched the scene again and again as they ran the takes. The sobbing, the silence, the scream. The scream never sounded quite the same. But they didn’t want it to be perfect. They wanted it *raw*.

When it was over, I felt hollowed out.

On my way out, I passed a hallway where two of the crew whispered urgently in a language I didn’t recognize. One of them noticed me and immediately stopped talking. He smiled too quickly. The other turned away and disappeared down a hallway marked **ARCHIVE**.

I didn’t ask what the Archive was.

That night, I lay awake, eyes fixed on the ceiling, playing the scene back in my head. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been *taken* from me.

But then I thought about the actor. His performance had been... *true*. Maybe uncomfortably so. Maybe that was the point.

Maybe they were right—maybe pain *did* need to be used. Maybe turning it into something beautiful was better than letting it rot inside you.

I told myself I’d go in again tomorrow. Just for a little longer. Just until I could find my footing again.

Day Two began earlier than expected.

I arrived to find a note duct-taped to the inside of the front door. It read, in slanted handwriting: **""Studio 4. Be present. No distractions. Today is about pain.""**

Studio 4 was farther into the building, tucked behind a corridor lined with black curtains and old reel canisters stacked like forgotten tombstones. I passed a man in a burlap sack mask who didn’t acknowledge me. A woman walked barefoot down the hallway whispering lines from *King Lear* to herself, bloody gauze wrapped around her hands.

The air in Studio 4 was dense and hot, like someone had turned the vents off hours ago. Two bright key lights illuminated a modest living room set: cracked wallpaper, a threadbare couch, old toys scattered across a stained carpet. In the middle stood a man in a wife-beater and slacks—red-faced, barrel-chested—pacing.

In the corner sat a girl.

Early twenties, maybe younger. Her shoulders hunched. Her eyes were hollow. Her hair hung damp in front of her face. Her breathing was shallow.

As I entered, one of the three ""producers"" from my interview appeared beside me, smiling like we were about to start a magic show. He handed me a clipboard.

""You’re helping direct this one,"" he said. ""We want raw truth. No gloss. No barriers.""

I looked down at the notes. *""Scene Objective: Confrontation. Daughter refuses to forgive. Father escalates. Real-time reaction. Film until breaking point.""*

My mouth went dry.

""Are they... are they actors?"" I asked.

""Method,"" he said, with a glint in his eye that didn’t quite fit his tone. ""They don’t break character. Ever. They know the boundaries. They signed the waivers. They each lived through this. An abused daughter, an abusive father. It has to be as real as it can get.""

As if on cue, the man turned and *slapped* the girl hard across the face. The sound cracked through the room like a whip. She didn’t cry out. Just flinched, swallowed the pain, and stared up at him with trembling defiance.

I staggered forward. ""Hey—what the hell—""

But the other producer caught me by the arm.

""Do not interrupt,"" he hissed. ""You’ll ruin the take.""

""That looked real.""

""It *was* real. That’s the point.""

I looked at the girl again. Her lip was bleeding. Just a little. Her eyes flicked toward me—pleading? Acting?

I didn’t know anymore.

""Pain,"" the producer whispered. ""It’s how we dig down to the marrow. You said you were ready to go the distance, didn’t you? We’re all ready to bleed for art, if you’re not… Then maybe…’’

I flinched. I desperately needed this, and besides, these actors could walk out any moment, if they felt like it; they had signed up for this. And so had I. There was no way I was going back to editing people’s wedding footage or be subjected to the dreadfulness of endless rejection.

They filmed the whole thing.

Later, after the others had filtered out—some laughing like nothing had happened, others dead silent—I sat alone in the break room, a cup of coffee going cold in my hand. I hadn’t taken a sip. The bitter smell made my stomach turn.

That’s when I saw her again. The actress from the scene.  
She moved past the doorway slowly, like she didn’t want to be seen. Her face was turned slightly, but not enough to hide the faint swelling near her jawline—or was it just shadow? She held her arm stiff, like it hurt to move. Her eyes caught mine for a split second. A flicker of doubt in her face, like she was trying to convince herself it had all been worth it.  
Like maybe, just maybe, the scene had cut deeper than she expected—and not just into her skin.

Then she disappeared down the hall, leaving me alone with a silence that suddenly felt heavier.

I told myself it had to be makeup. A trick of light. Method acting pushed to the extreme. But doubt festered in the pit of my chest.

And yet... even through the confusion, the nausea, the dread—something inside me stirred.  
Something old. Curious.

I wanted to stay.

Not just because I needed the job.  
But because I was starting to understand why they called it **true** art.  
And that realization intrigued me… I wanted to know more. A sick curiosity gnawed at me. I wanted to see how far they were willing to go. Maybe even… How far I was willing to go.

**The third day things got even weirder.** The morning began with an all-hands meeting in the screening hall—though no films were shown. Rows of plastic chairs faced a low stage where the studio's executives eventually emerged. Three of them. I’d never seen them before, and something about them didn’t sit right.

They looked… wrong.

Faces too smooth, as if they’d been vacuum-sealed in place. Skin waxy, almost artificial under the buzzing fluorescents. Their smiles were stiff—identical, too wide, showing too many teeth. They blinked too little. Moved too slowly. Like actors playing human beings for the first time and just barely getting it right.

“Thank you for coming,” said the one in the middle. His voice was oddly deep, like a dubbed track just slightly out of sync. “We know some of you are tired. Maybe even confused.”

His smile never moved.

“But that’s good,” he continued. “Doubt is part of the process. Doubt means we’re near the edge of something meaningful. And the edge… is where true art begins.”

The others nodded in perfect rhythm, like marionettes sharing one brain.

“We ask for your trust. We ask that you keep giving yourselves to this work, even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts. In the end, every frame we capture will be proof that you mattered. That *we* mattered. This studio—*you*—will make history.”

There was scattered applause. A few murmured affirmations. I clapped too, but my hands felt numb. I looked around and it hit me, all of these people gathered here, I recognized the look in their eyes. I had seen it in the mirror. Desperation. A yearning to belong somewhere, somewhere that mattered. Somewhere that made them someone.

Afterward, I was handed a manila folder with today’s scene assignment. I flipped it open, and my breath caught in my throat.

One page. Sparse dialogue. Two boys, seated on a living room floor. A blanket fort. Crayons. Plates of grilled cheese sandwiches cut into dinosaur shapes.

My stomach dropped.

I remembered it.

I must’ve been eleven. My brother, Jeremy, was seventeen—older, cooler, already half-stepping into the world beyond me. But that day, none of that mattered.

I’d been sick for days—curled on the couch under a fleece blanket, limbs aching, skin burning with fever, the kind of flu that makes the ceiling blur and the hours dissolve into static. Our parents were both at work, stretched thin and tired. But Jeremy stayed home. He said school could wait.

He pulled the couch cushions to the floor and draped a blanket over two chairs, building a crooked little fort that glowed soft from within. He lined up a stack of dusty VHS tapes—*The Iron Giant, Jurassic Park, The Princess Bride*—and told me we were having a film festival. Just us. Sick day cinema.

Then he disappeared into the kitchen. I could hear him clattering pans, muttering like a mad scientist. When he came back, he had a plastic plate in his hands. On it were two grilled cheese sandwiches, each cut—messily but unmistakably—into the shape of dinosaurs.

He held it out like a sacred offering. “Eat them fast,” he said, eyes wide with mock seriousness, “or they’ll eat you first.”

I laughed so hard I thought I’d puke. My head pounded, my throat burned—but for a few seconds, none of that mattered. It was perfect. A small, silly moment wrapped in warmth and grilled cheese grease and the safety only an older brother can give.

That day became sacred in my memory. One of the few untouched by what came after. Untouched by hospitals, by loss, by the long hollow stretch of silence that followed his death.

In that moment, Jeremy wasn’t just my brother.

He was the whole world.

But the scene I held in my hands was not *that* memory.

It wore its skin, but something was deeply, hideously wrong.

The header at the top read:

**INT. BLANKET FORT – DAY (Rough script, room for improv)**

Just like it had been. The couch cushions. The blanket canopy. The soft glow from a flashlight balanced in a plastic bucket. A plastic plate of grilled cheese sandwiches, cut like dinosaurs.

But then:

**OLDER BROTHER (17)**  
*(Wide smill as wide as you can)*  
You have to eat *all* of them. You promised.

**YOUNGER BROTHER (11)**  
I don’t want to. They look wrong.

**OLDER BROTHER (guilting his younger brother. Sadness in tone. Like a betrayal has happened.)**  
This was the best I could do.  
Don’t you like it? But I made them just for you… All my love is in there.

Stage direction:

**The younger boy hesitates. He picks up a sandwich. Bites. A crunch. Too sharp. He recoils. Blood spills from his mouth.**

**YOUNGER BROTHER**  
*(muffled, panicking)*  
It hurts—

**MORE BLOOD.**

**He opens the sandwich. It’s filled with shards of glass.**

And then:

**OLDER BROTHER**  
Keep chewing.  
If you don’t eat them fast, they will eat your soul.

I could barely breathe. My eyes scanned further, through the rest of the script, as my stomach twisted in protest. It continued—coldly, precisely—describing how the boy tries to scream, but his tongue is already cut. How the brother sits back in the corner of the fort, watching. Unblinking.

Smiling.

**OLDER BROTHER (CONT’D)**  
The story doesn’t end until the mouth is quiet.

I gripped the folder tighter, the paper warping under my fingers. I wanted to tear it apart. Burn it. But I couldn’t stop reading.

This… this was sacred. This memory. One of the last pieces of my brother that hadn’t been warped by loss. A day I’d kept locked in a quiet corner of my mind, too precious to speak aloud.

And yet—here it was. Filleted. Perverted.

No one could’ve known.

I’d never told anyone. Not in interviews. Not in therapy. But… Did I write in the blog I had at one point? I wasn’t sure.

But somehow, *they* had found it.

And worse… twisted it into this... Abomination.

I confronted one of the creative leads during break. The same man who’d asked me in the interview what the worst thing that ever happened to me was.

He looked at me with wide, unblinking eyes. Calm. Reverent.

“We’re not recreating your pain,” he said. “We’re giving it form. Letting it breathe. So it can mean something more than just… loss. Listen, I know this seems unconventional, but this is a meditation on how our memories are warped and turned into monstrous things when we process pain and loss. You must understand that on some level. You’re such a creative force, so focused, you just have to let it out.’’

“It already *meant* something. I can’t direct this monstrosity.”

He didn’t argue. Just nodded slowly.

“You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t believe in what we’re doing here. Give it time. You’ll understand.’’

I wanted to scream. But I didn’t. Because part of me… part of me wanted to see how they’d do it. How close they’d get. How far they’d go.

That part of me terrified me.

But it also kept me in the room.

They called “action,” and the air changed.

The silence in the studio thickened—too complete, like sound itself had been warned to stay away. A chill rolled down the back of my neck, even though the lights above were sweltering. The set looked simple: a sagging blanket fort assembled from old chairs, frayed quilts, and dusty couch cushions. A child’s domain, built for comfort. Safety.

But something about it was *wrong*.

The way the shadows pooled under the blankets. The way the light refused to touch the far corners. It looked like my memory of the fort, but refracted—as if remembered by something that didn’t quite understand love.

Two boys sat cross-legged inside. One older, one younger.

The older one pushed forward a chipped plate with three dinosaur-shaped sandwiches. Peanut butter and jelly. Crusts trimmed, poorly. It mirrored a day I remembered vividly—Jeremy and I, home alone. I was sick. He wanted to cheer me up. It had been warm. Human. Kind.

This wasn’t.

“Eat,” the older boy said.

His voice wasn’t cruel. It wasn’t anything. It was hollow. Like something speaking through him. The kind of voice that doesn’t come from the lungs, but from behind the eyes.

The younger boy reached, hesitating. He picked up one of the sandwiches. A Stegosaurus. Bit into it.

He winced.

Crack.

Something shimmered in the jelly—clear, sharp. The boy coughed and spat into his palm.

A shard of glass, stained red.

I jolted forward—but didn’t move.

Was it real?

No one shouted “cut.” No one flinched. The crew stood still, watching. Unblinking. Reverent.

The older boy leaned in, his voice a whisper:

“Keep eating. You’re having pain for lunch. If you don’t eat them, they’ll eat your soul.”

My heart stopped.

This felt so wrong, so why didn’t I stop it?

I looked around.

One of the executives stood behind the camera, smiling thinly, hands folded like a priest at a ritual. His eyes never blinked. The whites too white.

“What is this?” I whispered. But no one answered.

I turned back to the monitor.

The boy chewed another bite, trembling. Blood pooled along his gums. The older one sat stiff, eyes dark, unwavering.

They weren’t just acting.

They were… *obeying*.

Like their movements had been pulled from a string strung across centuries.

Like they had stepped into something old—something that used people the way a violin uses strings.

The set hummed. Not audibly, but deep down in the bones. A vibration. A tension. The air felt aware.

I should’ve shouted. I should’ve pulled them out.

Instead, I whispered: “Keep rolling.”

Because something in me wanted to see. Something ancient, quiet, and buried had begun to rise. Curiosity? Hunger? Worship? True dedication to the art?

I didn’t know.

I only knew that I *couldn’t* stop watching.

When the scene ended, no one applauded. No one exhaled. The boys left the set in silence, eyes unfocused, steps soft as sleepwalkers. Staff came in and cleaned up what I hoped was fake blood.

And I stood there, heart pounding, ears ringing—knowing I'd crossed some invisible threshold.

One of the producers clapped me on the back.

“You made something real today,” he whispered. “That’s rare. Hold on to that.”

His hand lingered for a moment too long.

I wanted to vomit.

Instead, I nodded.

That night, I sat awake until morning, replaying every detail, every line. I told myself what I had seen was wrong, that it hadn’t been acting, but something entirely different... Something deeply wrong.

But a voice inside me whispered something else:

You didn’t stop it.

You *directed* it.

And part of you *felt alive.*",2,1750534485.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I learned that she specifically said in her message if he knows anyone, not him. She thought that a poly set up probably wouldn’t be something good for me and she knew he was in an open relationship with a mutual friend. He contacted me and we talked non-stop for over a month before meeting for coffee and hung out for the whole day. He was great, but neither of us had any expectations. He was very forthcoming that he is currently seeing two other women. Cool, whatever, I didn’t think I’d be around too long. Turns out, I am really into this guy. It’s super rare for me to actually be interested in anyone. Long story short, I ended up being the one he vents to about his cyclical issues with the other girls. I’ve got opinions about them and quite frankly, I think they’re pretty manipulative. I very much want them to be happy, I know he really feels for them so I did my best to give him different perspectives and now it just seems like I ended up being someone to support his other relationships and give him absolutely electric sex. I’m new to polyamory, and I think I’ve definitely gotten away from the monogamous socialization we’ve all been subjected to. I’ve tried to limit my feelings for him and keep my expectations low, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be real emotion or anything, right? Every time I’ve taken issue with anything, I’ve mentioned it and we talked about it and it never happens again. He really does seem to want to keep me happy to the extent that he can. But has never, ever told me what my “role” is or how he feels about me. We relate very much in a non-casual way in my opinion. I see him regularly, we go on short trips, I’ve met his circle, etc.. So after months of really just burying my need for verbal confirmation, I asked him if he could please tell me what his feelings are and where he’s at. I got a one-word answer: amazing. That gutted me. Really? That’s it? I took that as we are definitely not meeting each other with the same intentions and said we should probably stop what we were doing. I feel so ridiculous. It’s been about 7 months since we’ve started seeing each other. I’d expect at least a few sentences. This is really just a vent. I’m heartbroken but I should’ve had this talk with him months ago. 

TLDR: new to polyamory, REALLY fell for a guy but never knew what our “situation” was. I asked and it didn’t turn out how I thought it would.",1,1750534370.0,polyamory,6,1.0,False
1lh4sbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1lh4sbj/against_a_career_in_tech/,Against a career in tech,"I am a 2004 graduate. I learned to code when I was 10 years old. It was fun and I became so obsessed I could not imagine myself not coding or not becoming a professional programmer.

After highschool I went to a private university to obtain a Bsc. And this is where things started going wrong.

Suddenly I became isolated from the female gender. I was too shy to talk to girls anyway but at least in highschool I had female classmates.

Now all my friends were also guys who liked DnD, Star Wars, LOTR and Manowar!

In fact they liked this lifestyle so much they refused my suggestions to go on trips to the beach, summer holidays, or just to go for coffee to a different place this time.

The other guys who were less nerdy seemed exclusively interested in football. And everybody was back-stabbing and antagonistic.

I ended up being bullied and developing PTSD.

Now what did a career in tech in Europe promiss to us at the time? The riches of Silicon Valley? Certainly not. We were to be cheap expendable cogs in local software houses, developing commercial apps in VB and java.

The familiar neckbeards would be there, the back-stabbing, the gossip and the cliques, sprinkled with envy of getting further ahead than the other guy. Same old chats about football, same old smells.

What was the end-game here? How would I advance socially? Most of those guys remained virgins with zero social skills. Might as well work as a gardener at a monastery.

Americans with overblown salaries grinded for the early retirement sleeping in trailers and dreaming of marriage.

But in Europe you were just a low paid outcast, who wore Metallica tshirts and only saw women in porn.

In other profession you could advance both socially and proffessionally. The work environment offered you a social education.

I studied abroad in Istanbul for some time and really loved the city! However, two days before I left back to the U.S, I was scratched by a cat in Bebek enough that it drew blood. Two of my friends had pet the cat but when I tried to, it swatted away my hand. This cat had a clipped ear and seemed fine.

Within days of being back in the US, I went to see a doctor who told me I should not be concerned about rabies or tetanus (I was up to date with tenants shots). I went on with life as normal after getting confirmation from a doctor that I was fine.

Now, 3 weeks later, I saw on the news a UK mother tragically passed in June after being lightly scratched by a puppy in Morocco. 

I am not seeking medical advice, however, I do know that animals with rabies pass away within 10-14 days. While my doctor told me I was fine and did not need shots, I am feeling quite anxious.

I have a video of the cat and the exact location of where it happened (right next to the Petra coffee shop in Bebek — Bebek, Küçük Bebek Cd. No:22/3, 34342 Beşiktaş/İstanbul, Türkiye ) and was wondering if anyone has seen or recognizes this kitty. I know it’s a really long shot in a city with thousands of cats but I thought I would try asking if anyone who lives locally can confirm it is alive and well—it would definitely ease my anxiety :( !

I’ve seen so many folks go from dabbling with writing on the side to turning it into a steady source of income.

You don’t need a fancy degree or years of experience to start. If you enjoy writing, have decent grammar, and are willing to learn, you can start earning [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/), right from your couch, kitchen table, or favourite coffee shop.

From [freelancing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/) and [blogging](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-blog/) to writing product descriptions or [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) captions, businesses and websites need writers all the time.

They need content to attract readers, explain products, or just share stories—and that’s where people like you and me come in.

Let’s get into it.

# 1. Freelance Writing for Clients

Freelance writing is one of the easiest ways to start making money as a writer. There are tons of companies, websites, and entrepreneurs looking for writers to help with blog posts, newsletters, website copy, and more.

**Where to start:**

* [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/)[](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)
* [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/)
* [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/)
* [ProBlogger Job Board]()
* [PeoplePerHour](https://www.peopleperhour.com/)

**Hey There!**

*Tired of empty promises and endless hustles? learn how to turn your skills and passions into your first $1,000 online. Stop dreaming, start earning.*

**Get Started -**  [**bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez**](http://bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez)

**How much can you earn?**

New freelancers often start at $0.05 to $0.10 per word, but experienced ones easily charge $0.25 to $1 per word or more, depending on the project.

**Tip:** Start with a niche. If you love writing about health, tech, parenting, or even finance—stick to that. It helps you stand out faster.

# 2. Start a Blog and Monetize It

[Blogging](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-blog/) takes time, but it can be a great long-term way to make money. If you’re passionate about a topic and enjoy writing consistently, [blogging](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-blog/) might be perfect for you.

You can make money through:

* Ads (like Google AdSense)
* Affiliate marketing (promoting products and earning a cut)
* Sponsored posts (brands pay you to write about their products)
* Selling your digital products (like ebooks or courses)

**Example:**

Michelle Schroeder-Gardner of *Making Sense of Cents* earns over $100,000 per month from her blog. Yes, seriously. And she started from scratch.

**Getting started:**

* Use [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) with a host like [Bluehost]()
* Write at least once a week
* Focus on topics that solve problems for your readers

**Tip:** [SEO](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/) (Search Engine Optimization) helps your blog get found on [Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/). Tools like [Ubersuggest]() or [AnswerThePublic](https://answerthepublic.com/) can help with keyword ideas.

# 3. Write for Revenue-Sharing Sites

Some websites pay you a portion of the ad revenue your article earns. It’s not huge at first, but it can add up over time—especially if you write evergreen content (the kind people search for year after year).

**Top platforms:**

* [Medium](https://medium.com/)
* [Vocal Media](https://vocal.media/)
* [HubPages](https://hubpages.com/)

**Hey There!**

*Tired of empty promises and endless hustles? learn how to turn your skills and passions into your first $1,000 online. Stop dreaming, start earning.*

**Get Started -**  [**bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez**](http://bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez)

**How it works:**

You write an article, publish it, and if it gets traffic or engagement, you get paid. On [Medium](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-medium/), for example, you get paid based on how long paying subscribers read your article.

**Tip:** Write helpful content with eye-catching titles. Lists, how-tos, and personal stories tend to do well.

# 4. Create and Sell Ebooks

If you’ve got knowledge or experience in a certain area, write an ebook. This could be anything from “How to Meal Prep for a Week” to “Beginner’s Guide to Freelance Writing.”

You can write and format it yourself using tools like:

* Google Docs or Word for writing
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or [Reedsy]() for design and formatting
* [Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)](https://kdp.amazon.com/) for publishing

**How much can you make?**  
It depends on the price and how many people buy, but some self-published authors earn $500 to $5,000+ a month.

**Tip:** Keep your ebook focused and helpful. Promote it on [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) or your blog if you have one.

# 5. Content Writing for Businesses

Companies need content for everything—emails, landing pages, brochures, product pages, you name it.

Content writing is less about storytelling and more about clear, useful writing that helps customers understand something or take action.

This type of work usually pays better than general [blogging](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-blog/), especially if you specialize in areas like:

* SaaS (software)
* E-commerce
* Finance
* Marketing

**Where to find clients:**

* LinkedIn
* Job boards like [Content Writing Jobs](https://contentwritingjobs.com/)
* Cold pitching businesses directly (short, polite emails work best)

**Tip:** Build a portfolio—even a few sample pieces in [Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/) Docs is enough to get started.

# FAQs

# Do I need a degree to get paid to write online?

Nope. What you need is strong writing, a good grasp of grammar, and the ability to write clearly.

# How do I build a portfolio if I’m just starting?

Write 2–3 sample articles on topics you want to work with. You can share them as [Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/) Docs or create a simple blog using a free platform like [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/).

# How do I avoid scams?

If a writing gig asks you to pay to apply, or it sounds too good to be true, walk away. Stick to well-known platforms, and always trust your gut.

#  How do I get better at writing?

Practice often. Read a lot. Use tools like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to catch mistakes. And get feedback whenever you can.

For some reason, zombies didn’t require sleep; In humans, this would lead to mental and physical degradation over time. But, it was yet to be discovered if zombies used their brains or purely relied on instincts. Fortunately, I wasn’t plagued with either of these problems.

It was late on the third night of the zombie-alien apocalypse

**""What do you know about your neighbors?""** I typed on the iPad and showed it to Madison. **""Are they home or evacuated or turned into zombies?""**

Madison didn't dare sit down comfortably anywhere, but feeling tired from the stress of earlier events, she decided to lean against the staircase banister where she could make a quick escape upstairs if needed.

""I saw Mr. Rogers cutting grass this morning,"" she said, ""But here's the weird thing - he's been doing that same exact routine for the last two days straight, and there's no electricity to power his lawnmower. So I'm pretty sure he's become a zombie. Honestly, he always gave me the creeps anyway. He used to stare at our house through his windows, especially when Zoe and I were sunbathing in the backyard like a total perv.""

She pointed toward the window facing the house next door. ""There's Connie and Terry - the blue house over there belongs to them. But I haven't seen either of them come outside since all this zombie stuff started. Their car is still in the driveway, so they're either hiding inside or... you know, dead.""

""And then there was this guy Randy who lived three houses down. He used to hit on Zoe every single time we went for walks around the neighborhood, which was super annoying. The last time I saw him was yesterday, driving away in his pickup truck while running over all the neighbors who had turned into zombies and were just hanging out on the street. He was laughing while he did it. Total psychopath.""

I typed again 

**“And what about you? Why didn’t you try to join the survivors to leave for a safer place? Staying alone in a house during a zombie apocalypse doesn’t seem like the safest bet.”**

""Where exactly am I supposed to go?"" Madison shot back, ""Is there really any safe place during a zombie apocalypse? I'm not completely stupid, okay? I had all my doors and windows locked, enough food stored for at least two weeks, and plenty of water. I figured by then the government or military would have better control over the situation, and rescue teams would naturally start looking for survivors who were trapped. I thought I'd just wait it out and escape with the professionals when they showed up.""

I considered her reasoning while typing my response. **""I don't know if that's necessarily a smart long-term strategy.""**

""FYI, just so you know,"" Madison replied with a slight edge to her voice, ""before you showed up here with zombie Zoe and broke down my bedroom door, I was living pretty safely and happily. My plan was working perfectly fine until you two arrived.""

She had a point. Her survival strategy of laying low and waiting for official rescue wasn't necessarily wrong, especially for someone without combat training or survival skills. 

**""Fair enough,""** I typed, not waiting to argue as I was running on low brain power mode. 

Madison tried to stay awake for as long as possible, clearly terrified that if she nodded off, she'd wake up being gnawed on - or worse, turned into one of us. But in the end, exhaustion won. At some point in the night, she curled up on the stairs and passed out like a scared kitten trying to sleep with one eye open.

Meanwhile, Zoe had at some point during the evening slipped away into what I assumed was her bedroom. When I checked on her later, she was just standing motionless in the middle of the room, staring at nothing in particular for the entire night. It was like she was a broken robot that had gotten stuck in standby mode.

I stayed awake and continued overthinking everything - the fungal networks, the alien invasion, what we were supposed to do next. But I finally slipped into unconsciousness around two or three in the morning. Though I had figured out something interesting: the more brains I consumed, the longer I could stay awake and maintain consciousness. It was weird, but on second thought, not so much. If the memories and knowledge were being absorbed into my system, maybe they were also providing some kind of mental fuel.

The next morning, Madison woke up with a loud, startled scream that echoed through the entire house. After that, she absolutely refused to come anywhere near me, keeping at least ten feet of distance at all times. I'd bet money she'd had some kind of nightmare about being eaten alive.

The gas was still working in the kitchen, so she made herself a stack of pancakes for breakfast. The smell was actually pretty appealing, and I decided I wanted to try some. Because free will! Even zombies should be able to enjoy pancakes. I took a bite, and I swear to God it tasted exactly like chewing on sand mixed with dirt. The texture was all wrong, the flavor was nonexistent, and my zombie taste buds apparently only responded to human flesh now. I spat it out immediately and pushed the plate away in disgust.

Zoe was still upstairs in her room, maintaining her statue-like pose and staring at nothing. But somehow that gave me hope that maybe she was still in there somewhere, trapped inside her own head. Maybe I was just being delusional and overly hopeful.

**""Can you drive?""** I wrote on the iPad and showed the message to Madison.

She was busy eating and had a large mouthful of pancakes, syrup dripping down her chin. ""Why are you asking?"" she mumbled through the food.

**“Because,”** I wrote, **“you’re going to help me.”**

When Madison read my message, she stopped chewing midway and definitely wasn't happy about being reminded why she was still alive.

""I don't have a car,"" she said after swallowing her bite of pancakes.

**""There are plenty abandoned on the roads,""** I typed out slowly, my zombie fingers still clumsy on the touch screen.

""But why do you even need a car and driver? Do you want to travel somewhere specific?"" Madison's voice was getting higher with anxiety. ""People are literally shooting anything that twitches. You think they’ll let me drive around with two zombies in the backseat? You’re insane. I’d get my head blown off before I hit the first red light.”

She really didn't hold back with her concerns, which I could respect. I decided to be equally direct in my response.

**""I'll eat you right now and finish all your problems, or you can leave the rest to luck,""** I typed with deliberate slowness. ""**So you decide. I'm getting very hungry.""**

The spoon slipped from her hand and clattered onto her plate. Her eyes widened like alien saucers as she stared at the message on the screen.

""I... I'll choose the second option,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

**""Smart choice,""** I typed back. Survivors always knew how to pick their battles.

Madison made a face. “You really know how to make a girl feel safe.”

I appreciate the sarcasm. It made things feel slightly more normal.

She uncomfortably shifted in her chair, ""When do you want to leave?""

""At night,"" I typed out slowly. ""It's safer that way. For all of us.""

After finishing breakfast, there wasn't much else to do except wait. I pulled back the living room curtains and stared out the front window to see if any humans were in the vicinity or roaming around killing zombies. The neighborhood was particularly quiet, with the occasional zombie wandering aimlessly down the street. Then there were a few slithering along the ground like slugs, broken in half at the waist - probably the result of getting run over by people frantically trying to escape in their cars. The sight was both pathetic and disturbing, watching these half-zombies drag themselves along using only their arms. However, I did notice one particular zombie that caught my attention. What had once been a person was now almost completely plastered to the asphalt, their head split open like a dropped watermelon from being run over by heavy tires. But the entire flattened corpse was covered in a thick layer of white mycelium, spreading out from the body like spilled flour. If you weren't looking carefully, it would just appear to be white powder scattered on the road. It was only when I focused hard and made out the vague human shape underneath that I realized it was actually a person. The mycelium had completely taken over his body and it was a mystery what would become of him now. I wanted to drag it inside the house to keep an close eye, but then waved the thought off. 

Overall, though, the immediate surroundings looked safe and quiet enough for now.

The rest of my day was spent resting and, against my better judgment, moving the headless golden retriever inside the house. This caused Madison to have what could only be described as a complete meltdown.

""What the fuck is wrong with you?!"" she shouted, pointing at the decapitated dog. ""Why are you bringing a dead dog into my house?! That's disgusting and probably unsanitary!""

When I explained through typing that it was actually a zombie dog and technically still alive and kicking, she freaked out even more and completely refused to speak to me for the next several hours. Just from the stress lines on her face, I could tell she was pretty close to having a complete mental breakdown and might go off at any moment.

However, I suddenly had an idea that might help with the dog situation.

**""Did any of your neighbors have pet dogs?""** I typed on the iPad.

""Why?"" she scoffed at me, ""Do you want to eat them too?""

I typed a response, then deleted it, then typed again, then took a deep breath out of pure habit even though I didn't need to breathe anymore. There was no point in wasting what little mental energy I had left dealing with her attitude.

**""Smiley face emoji. Very funny,""** I typed, then let out a low growl that was enough to scare away whatever courage she'd managed to gather.

""I don't know,"" Madison said, clearly frustrated and throwing her hands up in exasperation. ""Everybody's got a dog nowadays. How am I supposed to keep track of everyone's pets? It's not like I don't have a job and my own life to worry about.""

I gave one last look at the poor headless golden retriever lying on the kitchen floor, then stepped outside into the back garden and broke the fence to get into the neighbors' backyard.

Peering through their sliding glass door, I could see a heavy-set woman sitting on the couch with what looked like half-eaten pizza still in her hands. She was staring at a television that was displaying nothing but black screen, her eyes completely blank and unfocused. She had clearly become a zombie but was perpetually stuck in her daily routine of watching TV, probably for all eternity.

But I was here looking for a dog, and I didn't see any sign of one. No food bowls, no leash hanging by the door, no dog toys scattered around. They probably didn’t have any.

The next house belonged to another elderly neighbor who was apparently dead on the floor, his body already in an advanced state of decomposition. Judging by the photos lining the dusty hallway walls, he must’ve been military in his prime. Uniforms, medals, a framed black-and-white photo of a younger version of him posing beside a tank. I didn’t linger, and quickly left the place, in no mood to attempt eating a soggy old man. He probably wouldn't taste good anyway. 

Moreover, I had made up my mind about something important: from now on, my diet would primarily consist of brains from high-functioning people like engineers, doctors, researchers, or artists. Their memories were often full of knowledge and substantial information that could help me understand more about what I was and what I was becoming.

The random consumption of anyone who happened to be dead was a waste of my limited consciousness resources.

I found what I was looking for in the third house - a couple who had both turned into zombies, and finally some dogs. Actually, there were three dogs total: one clearly dead and decomposing, a second that had become a zombie and was standing motionless in the corner, and a third who was whimpering pitifully in what appeared to be both sadness and hunger because no one had been playing with it or feeding it. It was heartbreaking to see the living dog's confusion and abandonment. I broke down the back door and stepped inside. The surviving dog immediately started barking at me but was clearly terrified, unsure what kind of creature I was. It continued barking as I walked through the house but didn't dare approach me. Maybe it could smell the scent of death and fungi that clung to my clothes and skin.

I gave it one last look, silently hoping it would eventually run away and find a new family to take care of it. Then I walked over to the dead husky, took out my knife, and carefully removed its head before returning to Madison's house.

Fortunately, when I got back, Madison was upstairs, which gave me ample and non-judgmental workspace to do what I needed to do. The rest of my afternoon was spent meticulously sewing the husky's head onto the golden retriever's headless body.

What I was doing was probably unethical by any normal standards. A doctor or scientist performing this kind of procedure might have received serious jail time in a properly functioning society. But normal ethical standards didn't really apply anymore, did they?

The new head remained completely unresponsive for the next couple of hours. However, I could visibly watch the mycelium network spreading around the wound site, slowly knitting the tissues together and sealing the surgical connection. I wondered if the fungal system needed additional nutrition to work faster, but I resisted the urge to feed it pieces of the dead people I'd encountered in the neighboring houses. 

At some point during my work, Madison had apparently seen me performing surgery on the dog, but she wisely chose not to come downstairs and interfere. That was a relief - I didn't need her commentary on my veterinary techniques. 

Finally, just before evening, the hybrid dog's eyes suddenly blinked open and it jumped down from the kitchen table with surprising agility. It barked like a completely normal, healthy dog and began wagging its tail enthusiastically. When I reached out to pet it, the dog rubbed its white husky head against my palm affectionately. It looked odd, certainly - a golden retriever body topped with a white and gray husky head - but why did appearance matter? The important thing was that it was alive and functional again. I named her, Mortis.

Night arrived uneventfully. My day had been busy and productive, though I'd slipped into unconsciousness three separate times throughout the day. If I didn't consume more people and brains soon, these blackout periods would probably become more frequent and last longer.

Madison had just finished her dinner and was sitting on the living room sofa, quietly reading a book by the light of a battery-powered lamp. She looked up nervously when I approached with the iPad.

**“The outside should be safe now,” I typed on the iPad and showed it to Madison. “Let’s go.”**

Madison closed her book slowly, took a deep breath, “Are you sure I won’t get eaten?”

**“Don’t worry,”** I typed, tapping faster now. **“I’ll be right beside you.”**

Next, I pulled out the car keys I'd stolen from one of the neighbors during my afternoon scouting expedition and placed them on the coffee table with a soft clink.

Madison squinted. “Whose keys are those?”

I had already prepared for this question and simply swiped to the next screen on the iPad. **""Your dead neighbor.""**

She jumped off the sofa like I’d just tossed a grenade onto it. “Did you *eat* him?!”

God, she was exhausting. Every conversation with her was like trying to reason with a fire alarm.

I tried to angrily jab my response on the iPad, but the emotion only made my clumsy zombie fingers even slower and more uncoordinated.

**“Why do you always assume the worst?”** I finally wrote. **“He was already dead.”**

""I find that hard to believe,"" she said, looking me up and down with obvious skepticism. But she refrained from making any additional accusations.

*Why was it so hard for people to accept that I was a good zombie?* Apparently, according to her expression, I was still somewhere between demon and dumpster raccoon. Before we stepped outside, I gestured for a disguise, something to make me look a little less undead. She rolled her eyes, rummaged through a drawer, and handed me a pair of ridiculous designer sunglasses and a fresh medical mask.

""You should be grateful - these were quite expensive when I bought them,"" she said sternly. ""You are absolutely forbidden to break them, and they need to be returned in the exact same condition.""

Sure, I thought with an internal sigh, and quickly put them on before adjusting the face mask to cover the lower half of my features. All this extra preparation was actually for Madison's sake, I needed *her* to feel safe, so we wouldn't be easily recognized while driving around outside. I could certainly have walked the streets alone without any disguise, but traveling inside a car with air conditioning at full speed had undeniable benefits. It was faster to find more people.

Then, just as we were stepping toward the door, Madison hesitated again.

“Wait… Are we not taking Zoe?”

I stopped. “**What is she going to** ***do*** **out there?”**

“I don’t know,” she said, hugging the doorframe like a hostage, “but if she’s staying, then I’m staying.”

I stared at her. “**You’ll regret it.”**

She shrugged. “I regret everything already.”

So I dragged Zoe out of her room. Literally. She was still in that blank, half-present zombie state, cooperative but limp. 

Next, Madison had to perform what was probably the most dangerous and disgusting task of her life: giving Zoe a bath. She was shaking like a twig in a hurricane while using the last buckets of clean water she'd been saving to wash off the dried blood and rotting smell that clung to Zoe's skin and hair. I obviously had to do more than half the work myself. If this were pre-apocalypse and Zoe had been my girlfriend, maybe I’d be celebrating this kind of intimacy. But now? It was just sad, and uncomfortable under Madison’s judgmental stare.  We dressed Zoe in a clean hoodie and jeans. I covered her face with a mask and slid on sunglasses to hide the dead, unfocused gleam in her eyes. Once done, unless someone really studied her, or she opened her mouth, she could easily pass as an extra quiet goth girl with a cold.

After about an hour of preparation, we all with Mortis in tow, made our way toward the neighbor's house together. Madison walked faster than Zoe and me, her nervousness making her pace quick and jittery. The car was sitting in the driveway exactly where I'd expected, and she had the engine running by the time we reached it.

I pushed Zoe into the back seat and climbed into the front passenger seat myself. Mortis huddled with Zoe, looking out the window as I rubbed her head. Thankfully, Madison didn't ask any question regrading why I was bringing a zombie dog with us.

""Where are we heading?"" She asked, looking at me expectantly while gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles.

I tapped out my message, then tilted the screen toward her so she could read: **“Do have an idea where the smart and rich people in this city live.”**

Madison squinted at the screen, then looked up at me like I’d asked her where the moon was parked. “Uh… you mean, like, the tech people? The brainy types?”

I nodded slowly, lifting a brow under my sunglasses. That was exactly what I needed to know. Brains worth eating. Minds packed with knowledge. Researchers. Neurologists, surgeons, AI developers, even a B-list actor or two if they had anything useful stored in their heads.

She shrugged, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Westside, obviously. Bel-Air, Brentwood, Pacific Palisades… maybe some up in the Hollywood Hills. Doctors, tech bros, finance guys, celebs trying to keep it low-profile. Gated neighborhoods, security systems, private guards, if anyone’s still alive, they’re hiding up there.”

I tapped the screen again and turned it to her:  **“We’ll start with Brentwood. Stick to surface streets. Drive carefully, avoid highways, and don’t stop for screaming.”**

She gave me a dry look. “You say that like I’ve stopped for screaming before. I’ve seen *28 Days Later*, okay? I know how this works.”

Zoe shifted in the back seat, bumping into the door with a low groan. Madison shot her a nervous glance in the mirror.

“Even though she's like my best friend, she creeping me out,” she muttered. “You and your dog creep me out less, which is somehow worse.”

I gave her a slow thumbs-up.

“God,” Madison muttered, adjusting her rearview mirror. ""I'm driving zombies to go brain shopping. This is officially the weirdest night of my life.”

I tapped the glass once in approval.  Then we pulled out of the driveway, past the shattered windows and dead flowerbeds, into the eerie stillness of suburbia on the brink of decay. The world was cracked, teetering, held together by thin human fear and fungal threads.

All of the following are complete first impressions and I expect the scents to change some as they sit in a (kinda) cooler environment.

I ordered 7 samples, 6 oil and 1 EDP. The oils didn't seem to be too affected by the travel, but the EDP I assume did. I got **Blackberry Heartwood** in an EDP just cause, but I wanna give it a fair chance to develop before reviewing because so many people seem to love it, so that review is coming later :)

**Likes:** wood, fruit, booze, spices, citrus, tea, incense, androgynous/masculine leaning scents  
**Dislikes:** florals, beachy notes, overly sweet notes, animalic musks, super ""femme"" scents 

  
**\~THE REVIEWS\~**

**Wandering Star:** *Pear, cashmere, iso e, guaicwood, brown sugar, white musks*

YUM. This smells genuinely warm. The only other perfume I've tried that smelled like there is literal heat in it is Holy Terror by Arcana. The pear and brown sugar work super well together, and I think the cashmere is what is adding the fuzziness. I was worried this would be too feminine on me, but I think it is just sweet and sexy in an androgynous way (others may disagree, but I like it). As it dries, I get more of the pear and the cashmere settles down. It settles into a slightly fruity brown sugar scent. This is a beautiful fragrance. 4.8/5

**1899:** *Lemon, whiskey, fruit, caramel, incense, cedar*

This is just a whisky sour. Like not in a hypothetical way, not a ""you threw the ingredients of something into a perfume so it smells like those components,"" it smells like a completed whisky sour that you'd get at a speakeasy. It is VERY caramelly at first, but then the whisky and lemon comes through and balances it completely. One of my all time favorite scents is Jazz Club from the Replica line and I was worried this would be too similar because that one is also pretty whiskey heavy, but it is a very different whisky scent that is equally beautiful and complex. 4/5

**Neon Noir:** *Pink limeade, cannabis leaf, plum, vetiver, cetalox*

I am very glad I didn't listen to the people saying that this just smelled like cannabis because believe me, I know what bud smells like and this is so much more complex. The limeade is tart and nostolgic and the plum adds a note of playfulness. The cannabis (to me) rounds this out in a way that isn't your typical 'added note for complexity' in a fruity fragrance and makes it lean very green-spicy. Don't get me wrong, it is weedy and the dankness charactarizes the fragrance, but I think it is definitely wearable. It is not my favorite thing ever, but there is a time and a place for it. 3/5

**We Played our Records Backwards too Many Times:** *Black cherry, coffee, orchids, vetiver*

I am once again glad I didn't listen to some other reviews on this, because this is not the dry, sour cherry that a lot of people were describing. On first application, this is cherry cough drop to the max with a super fresh orchid scent. I don't get coffee from this at all really. Once it dries a bit, the cherry mixes with the vetiver and brightens up a bit, but on me it retains the candy-like sweetness of initial application. I don't think this is for everyone, but lucky for me, cherry is my favorite candy flavor. I'm excited to see how this wears and what I can mix it with. 4/5

**Ashara:** *Nilgiri tea, black ink, white agar, palm dates*

I was not sure about this when I first smelled it on paper, but after it dried down and when I put it on skin, it is stunning. The first thing I get from this is bubble tea but with crystal pearls rather than the tapioca ones (iykyk). I think the ink adds a touch of sourness on top in the dry down, but wow does it smell like my favorite boba order (some sort of green tea with the white pearls). I assume it is the agar, and I think I found a new favorite note. 4.8/5

**Turyin:** *Pomegranate, plums, sandalwood, gunpowder*

Now THIS is what I want fruity fragrances to be. Not juvenile and candy-like, but genuine fruit like if you had mulled the fruit itself and smelled the juice. The pomegranate note is gorgeous and is not too sweet in the slightest. I am not sure how I feel about the sandalwood in this, which is unfortunate because I typically love sandalwood. To me, it smells like fruit juice but with something else that I don't know how I feel about. It may be a case of needing a week or two to settle, so I will be revisiting this for sure. For now, 2.5/5

**\~\~**

Wow, I have never had such a high hit rate with a house before, never mind before the samples even got the chance to age and settle after traveling. I am pretty picky with perfume, so to me, this is like an unheard of level of success with a sample set. I love their DNA and I highly recommend checking out this house!!

It’s the one thing that [AI](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-ai/) can’t replicate (not well, anyway), and it’s showing up in more job descriptions than ever before.

A report by the World Economic Forum ranks it as one of the **top skills needed for the future of work**, right next to problem-solving and creativity.

Think about it. With all the information we scroll through every day, how do you figure out what’s true and what’s nonsense?

How do you make good decisions fast? How do you solve problems when you don’t have all the answers? That’s where critical thinking comes in.

And the best part? You don’t need to go back to school, buy expensive courses, or spend hours each day.

You can start building this skill right now in just **30 minutes a day**—right from your phone, your kitchen table, or even your morning commute.

Let me show you how.

# What Is Critical Thinking?

It’s not about overthinking or trying to sound smart. Critical thinking is just a fancy way of saying: **you can look at a situation, ask the right questions, and make good choices**.

It means:

* Thinking clearly without getting pulled into emotional drama[](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)[Claim Your Spot](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)FEATURED
* Questioning what you read or hear, instead of taking it at face value
* Solving real problems using logic, facts, and a bit of creativity
* Knowing when to speak up—and when to listen

It’s useful at work, at home, with family, with friends—**literally everywhere**.

# Why It’s the [\#1](https://tchelete.com/tag/1/) Skill in 2025

The world’s not slowing down. New tech is changing how we live and work. [AI](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-ai/) is writing emails, coding apps, even designing websites. But one thing it *can’t* do well? **Think critically like a human.**

According to [LinkedIn](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-linkedin/)’s 2024 Workplace Learning Report, 64% of learning and development leaders are focusing on **soft skills**, with critical thinking topping the list.

Another stat? Jobs that require critical thinking pay up to **$15,000 more per year** on average compared to roles that don’t emphasize it. [Here’s the full report if you’re curious.]()

Employers love it. Teams work better when people can solve problems without waiting for a manager. And honestly, your life gets easier too—when you stop making the same old mistakes and start spotting better options.

# How Do I Build It in 30 Minutes a Day?

You don’t need a PhD. You don’t need to read long textbooks. What you need is a daily habit that fits into your life. Here’s how I do it—and how you can too.

# 1. Ask Better Questions (5 minutes)

Start your day with one good question. Something simple like:

* What’s the real problem here?
* What’s another way to look at this?
* What would I tell a friend to do?

Write it down. Think about it while you make coffee or walk the dog.

The goal is to train your brain to *pause* before reacting. Over time, that tiny shift changes everything.

# 2. Read Smarter, Not More (10 minutes)

Every day, pick **one article or** [**podcast**](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-podcast-and-make-money/) **episode** on a real-world topic—something outside your bubble. Could be news, science, health, tech, whatever.

But here’s the trick: **question it** as you read.

* Who’s saying this?
* What’s their angle?
* What’s missing?

You’re not just consuming info—you’re learning to *process* it. I like using [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) or [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) to save articles and reflect on them later.

# 3. Play With Problems (10 minutes)

This is the fun part. Use puzzles, games, or real-life challenges to stretch your brain. Sudoku, logic apps, or brain-training games like [Lumosity](https://www.lumosity.com/) are solid choices. Even debating with a friend (nicely!) counts.

If you’re working, try this: take a small issue you’re stuck on, and list **three ways to solve it**—even if they sound silly. This builds mental flexibility and helps you practice thinking differently.

# 4. Reflect & Review (5 minutes)

End your day with one question:

**“What’s one thing I learned today that changed how I think?”**

You’ll be shocked how much your mindset shifts when you reflect on your choices.

# FAQs

# Is critical thinking just for people in leadership or tech roles?

Not at all. It’s useful in *every* job—from teachers and nurses to artists and parents. If you work with people, solve problems, or make decisions (aka everyone), this skill helps.

# What if I only have 10–15 minutes some days?

That’s fine. The 30-minute plan is flexible. Do what you can. Even **5 intentional minutes** a day is better than nothing.

# Can I teach this to my kids or team?

Absolutely. These habits work for anyone, any age. In fact, the earlier you start, the better.

# Free Tools To Help You Practice

Here are a few I’ve used and trust:

* [Critical Thinking Mini-Guide by Foundation for Critical Thinking]()
* [Think Again by Adam Grant – Summary on Blinkist]()
* [Brain Pickings – Maria Popova’s thought-provoking essays](https://www.themarginalian.org/)
* [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) has short, high-quality courses on mental clarity and critical thinking
* [MindTools]() – simple guides and exercises

# How I Make It a Habit (My Personal Routine)

Here’s how I fit it into my day:

* **Morning (5–10 min):** I read a thought-provoking quote or article
* **Lunch break (10–15 min):** I challenge myself with a problem, puzzle, or quick journaling prompt
* **Evening (5 min):** I reflect in my notes app—just one sentence

No pressure. No perfection. Just a bit of practice, every day. Like going to the gym, but for your brain.

If I am in an awkward group setting with new people or hostile people..... and if those individuals are necessary for my career or family or love... I will be a people pleaser and try to get people to like me .. initiatie conversations... Tell them exactly what they want to hear... Make them like me... Even manipulate them sometimes.

But if they are not important I will be quiet and introverted.

Empathetic definately... I cry in every stupid movie... I just somehow relate to everything and everyone around me and start feeling their emotions as my own.. I cry a lot bcz of that...

It wasn't helpful in my career .. I am doctor and it made me weak.. over the years I have tamed this empathy a lot ... I do feel ... I do relate.. but i cry in private now if I lose a patient... And if I knw i will lose a patient... I just avoid that attachment situation completely... 

I am very loyal in friendships and relationships... I guess I idealise my partner to some extent ... So other people look dull in comparison..

1lh4hfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMySpaceAI/comments/1lh4hfs/from_cluttered_to_curated_how_style_blast_ai/,From Cluttered to Curated: How Style Blast AI Revolutionized This Living Room!,"Hello r/DesignMySpaceAI community,

We recently took on a fascinating challenge from a user struggling with their living room. Their main pain points were: oversized couches, a need for a better coffee table, an unfinished feel, and a clashing TV/fireplace setup. They also mentioned issues with dead space near connecting double doors.

Our Style Blast AI stepped in to provide a stunning and highly functional transformation. Here's a breakdown of what the AI did:

**Before & After:**

[Before](https://preview.redd.it/ue0vkd0jyb8f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1df1fce875964c7fb695aba240c776766d2fff57)

[After](https://preview.redd.it/xn64havwyb8f1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46481fdd58276561b6bf494551a367cf1f923f58)

**What the AI Did:**

* **Optimized Seating:** The AI intelligently reconfigured the seating. Instead of two large, bulky couches that felt overwhelming, it introduced a more streamlined L-shaped sectional that perfectly hugs the wall, paired with two elegant armchairs by the bay window. This creates defined zones for conversation and relaxation without overcrowding the space.
* **Modern Coffee Table:** The clunky old coffee table was replaced with a sleek, minimalist design featuring a warm wooden top and a modern black metal frame. This lighter, more contemporary piece instantly elevates the room's aesthetic and improves flow.
* **Cohesive & Finished Look:** The AI focused on adding layers of design to combat the ""unfinished"" feel. This included strategically placed artwork, a stylish floor lamp, and thoughtful decor elements that tie the entire room together, giving it a curated and complete appearance.
* **Harmonized TV & Fireplace:** Instead of forcing the TV above the fireplace (which the user wanted to avoid), the AI proposed integrating the TV into a more modern console that sits comfortably beside the fireplace. The overall refined aesthetic of the AI-generated design helps the TV and fireplace coexist more harmoniously, becoming features rather than clashing elements.
* **Improved Flow:** While not directly shown in the transformed image of the main area, by optimizing the primary living space, the AI's layout naturally creates better flow and transitions to adjacent areas, implicitly reducing the ""dead space"" issues the user mentioned in connecting rooms.

This transformation showcases how Style Blast AI can tackle complex layout issues and aesthetic challenges to create beautiful, functional spaces tailored to your needs.

I am a novice in the espresso world, looking to buy a fully automated espresso machine, however, I am a bit lost with the amount of possibilities that exist out there.

To me, the important features are:

* Espresso Quality
* Easy of use, i.e., just press the espresso button
* Adjust espresso intensity

I am not interested into other features, such as manual or automated Milk Frother, making capuccinos, etc.

My main goal and ideal usage for the machine, is to just put the coffee beans, adjust the intensity that I want the espresso, and press a button. 

  
I have recently bought the Philips Baristina Automatic Espresso Machine but it ended up being a very disappointing experience, probably had some defect since water would spill all over the place, and I had to return it.

 I (35 f) have been dating my bf (32 m, we'll call him Don) for 2 years, we moved in together a year ago. 
Background, I have anxiety and depression, both I'm actively aware of and am working on, via doc appointments, therapy, and trying to explore a missed diagnosis. 
Don was/is completely aware this is something I've been working on. 
Well back in Jan my grandfather (mom's side,  Peter for story sake) got very sick, and scared all the family. Grandpa Peter and I have always been close, with him naming me and me creating a family nick name for him (its pretty unique, so forgive me for not sharing). Of course this scared me, deeply. It caused a decent flare in my anxiety/depression. I decided to take 1 mental health day to recover from the scare. Thats the first time Don ever criticized me for taking care of my mental health. It became a big deal with him telling me I just needed to ""put on my big girl panties."" I explained it was one day and him criticizing me wasn't helping my mental health. 
Fast forward to the beginning of June and many more reminders that him being critical of me trying to work through anxiety/depression wasn't the way I needed support. 
At one point I just asked him to be nice to me. He said he ""Didn't have the engery."" 
I tell him my grandma (dad's side) passed and her funeral wouldn't be for a while because of logistics. I let my job know everything, she passed, the funeral wouldn't be for at least 2 months and several states away. I found out I only get 3 days for leave. 
So the logistics would be 3 days for an out of state funeral, 1 day driving 18+ hours up, 1 day funeral, 1 day back. I dont have the time, money, and energy to accomplish this. 
I tell work a few days later, logistically its not going to happen. They understood and let me take the days for a private weekend. 
I tell Don the plan and he stops texting for the day. 
When he comes home he tells me I was being too dramatic by telling work and taking the days. He also said I shouldnt cry over her because ive made no effort to visit her in the last 3 years. He said he knew he was wrong for saying it but couldn't let it go. 
I told him if that's how he felt I'm moving into the spare room. 
So that's where ive been. He avoids spending time with me, but still makes my coffee every morning, checks on my car/bike and works on them (ive told him he doesnt need to), still tells me to be careful because of weather, but won't spend time in the same room as me. 
He just says until I go somewhere he's gonna keep doing those simple things. 
One last thing, in the middle of everything, around April I suggested counseling, he said no because he did it with his ex wife and it didn't work. 

So TL:DR

1lh4a6m,https://i.redd.it/xz69ihn5sb8f1.jpeg,SeamlessShelf35's SMG4 Reviews: SMG3's New Mascot,"Third time is not the charm.

  
Plot: Meggy gets a job as the new mascot for SMG3's Coffee N' Bombs, which all chaos ensues.

  
Pros

\- We got cameos of FM, X and the Mario Reskin Police Officers and I really liked that. At least they're not being forgotten like some other side characters.

\- The God Box returns only as an Easter Egg, which is cool, even though I'm not a fan of the Revelations arc.

\- Match from Battle for Dream Island (or BFDI as it's commonly referred to) makes an appearance in this, and for a BFDI fan like me, her appearance was decent, even though I think Match is meh nowadays (No disrespect to some Match fans). I find it quite amusing that both Match and Meggy have a history of being harsh on their best friends, though Meggy has actually been a lot nicer to Mario recently, which is nice. Don't know about Match, though.

  
Cons

\- I didn't like the Meggy Torture in this. I know people will just think I'm taking slapstick way too seriously, and no, it's not like the kind of torture she went through in Western Spaghetti, but I think it should stop. I get they're trying to make her silly and funny, but I think this is a bit of an over exaggeration to be honest.

\- Why does Meggy need a job? She already got a job as a sports coach. Grand Theft Mario and The Race of All Time (which released last month, by the way) literally exists, guys. Did the crew just forget about that? Why couldn't they get someone else to be the mascot? A bit pointless to put Meggy in this episode, it I'm honest.

\- Like the last two videos, the jokes are still not good.

\- The pacing was way too fast that I just lose concentration on what the hell is happening in the episode, which was the same thing I said with the pilot episode of The Gaslight District (It's still good, though).

  
Overall thoughts:

While it's thankfully not awful like the previous video, it's honestly boring, unfunny and way too fast-paced. Can we start the new arc next week?

My friend's nephew got 6,600 streams on the major platforms. He was buzzing about it - thought he'd made some decent money. Reality? £19.80.

But here's the kicker: if those same 6,600 people had bought his music directly at £0.85 each (less than a coffee), he'd have made £5,610.

Same music. Same people. £19.80 vs £5,610.

Let's scale this up. 500,000 streams (decent viral hit territory):



Major streaming platforms: roughly £1,500

Direct sales: £450,000



The artist gets 0.003% while the platforms keep 99.997%. Not 10%. Not 50%. Ninety-nine point nine nine seven percent.

Meanwhile, these platforms are worth tens of billions.

I'm not anti-streaming for listeners - it's convenient and cheap. But for artists? It's financial suicide disguised as ""exposure."" We've created a system where musicians work for free while tech companies get rich off their creativity.

The saddest part? Young artists celebrate stream counts without realizing they're working for literal pennies. They've been conditioned to think this is normal.

What if fans could actually invest in the music they love instead of just consuming it for almost nothing? What if supporting artists meant both parties could win?

The realization hits you like an oblivious driver hits an unsupervised child. Emerges the question, who is the sorry soul cast with the burden behind the demise of innocent, pure, fresh life. Surely, it couldn’t be the driver, who had no way of knowing that a small body would spontaneously run onto the road in chase of a ball, vibrantly striped yellow and red against the pavement. What about the parents, shouldn’t they have been paying close attention to their child, or rejecting his endless pleads to go play outside? No, you can’t blame the parents. They were overwhelmed with the jobs that house and feed them on top of the bills, the taxes, the judgment, the hassling. Too much was on their backs for it to be their fault. Afterall, it might just be their first time living too. Maybe it’s the child’s own doing, who absentmindedly ran onto the street, forgetting to look left and right like they’re taught in preschool or those obnoxious television programs. Of course not, children are just mere masses of flesh who weren’t give enough time to comprehend that they are closer to death by the second, one way or another. Brains limited to simplicity. In those 24.3 seconds, that ball was all his universe was, slowly drifting away from him. *Chase the ball, that is your purpose, that is all that matters.* 

Was it the teenage cashier at the grocery store who offishly sold the ball to the boy’s mother? Was it the pale-skinned European factory worker who painted the red and yellow stripes onto it? This is a stupid train of thought. No matter who or what is to blame, the accident was fatal. Life was deprived of a mind yet to develop, while those who developed long ago were left with feelings of misery and mourning that would eat them up until every last shred of skin was decayed beneath 6 feet of dirt. But it’s all God’s plan, right? Maybe we should count the boy lucky. 

The human brain was cursed with curiosity, questions that will never be answered. If God exists, who is *his* Lord? If God exists, why didn’t he just tell us? Supposedly he left traces of existence, messages sent to the few chosen. That way, only those of true faith will join him in paradise. But if that’s the case, why did he stop? We don’t see Prophets in this day and age. Perhaps holy history is made up of hallucinations, perhaps the excruciating heat of Mecca led to deranged visions, and the unfortunate Moroccan man was just another tragic example of the human capacity to hate. Hate. It can’t exist without love/ Everyone who hates must love, even if it’s small and insignificant. 

The idea that religion is merely a coping mechanism is not revolutionary nor that uncommon, so why do I feel so guilty for thinking outside the box? If you have faith that the box is salvage, then once you take your final breath, there is nothing to lose if you were wrong the entire time. And the cat inside the box, well she's both dead and alive until you open it. I always believed that thought experiment was stupid, until I realized that’s the whole point. Your observation isn’t in line with the forces of nature, especially your uncertainty. Perhaps the men of our society are made up of Judge Holdens, who hate the idea that something may exist without their knowledge. 

I’m sorry. I’ve rambled as per usual. I won’t tell you my name, simply because I don’t see how that would help fulfill my purpose. My purpose is to tell you a story. This is the story of how the red and yellow striped ball was never what we thought it was. The smell of freshly cut green grass, the blood-stained sunset dimming the clouds, the shining skin navy blue truck becoming indented, were all the beginning of our eternal punishment. Don’t search for tiny holes of white light, for they slowly started to close up. We can not escape this. But for some reason, amidst our putrescence, I see you beside me. You’ve always looked after me, your figure is hard to make out, like a slight blur in the mirror. Infinity is lost, so with the time we have left, I suppose we’re all owed a bit of an explanation, especially you.

November 28th, 1996. “The Eyes of Providence.” That’s what they called themselves. They lived in rural Utah, a great big farm they built for themselves. It was a beautiful scene, really, at least from what the pictures said. The sky was always a bondi blue, the sun created a peaceful yellow blanket of life against grass and skin. They kept animals, these big brown cows, white horses with long silky manes, dogs who would cool themselves in the moist soil, and butterflies. Pink, orange, and purple butterflies with black lines creating floral patterns in their wings and white dots like stars in the midnight sky. The farm building was deep red, like the ones you see in cartoons or eyesight tests. The EoP, that’s what I’ll refer to them as from here. The men had shoulder length hair and beards like brown sheep’s wool, they wore white robes that fell over their bodies like creamer into coffee. The women also wore white dresses, not the wedding type, but with gloves and bonnets and veil-like fabric that tinted their faces the color of clay. They were all always smiling, and it wasn’t the forced kind as if they were being held against their will. Their expressions were genuine, of those who felt the pure love of their supposed divine Father. 

“And now for our next segment we strongly advise viewer discretion and especially if there are any children present. As of the early morning, November 29th, 1996, the infamous cult known at The Eyes of Providence in rural Utah have partaken in a mass suicide. The farmhouse in which the one-hundred-and-thirty-five members resided in was intentionally set ablaze.” 

*And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am, John 14:3* 

Their leader was Gideon Freeman, a charming man who saw God in all his glory, and his filth. They called him Father Freeman, he was raised in an atheist household. A drunk father, an emotionally absent mother, siblings who he never heard from again after highschool, your typical American white-trash family. When Gideon was a young boy, he was hit by a truck outside of their suburban home. He spent 5 months in a coma, and when he finally came to he was never quite the same. This was the start of what his teachers would label “temper-tantrums,” but I’d rather refer to them as what they were: violent outbreaks. He loved to draw, but his pieces weren’t lazy crayola dinosaurs and rocketships, they were visual representations of Hell itself. People were engulfed in flames, screaming in sheer agony, crying for their mothers to come pull them out of this never-ending torture as their flesh became a jet-black char. When asked about these drawing, Gideon always assured his horrified classmates that they deserved to be there, the pain was only a result of ignorance. What really worried his teachers, though, was that he took it upon himself to handle the wrongdoings of his peers. Thomas Peterson was quite the energetic boy, he loved planes, helicopters, trucks, anything that would allow someone to travel without using their own two feet. One day, Thomas rammed his plastic G.I. Joe into Gideon’s fanciful church made from wooden blocks. All in good fun… is what Thomas thought. Gideon pinned him to the ground and jammed a freshly sharpened pencil into his left eye, for little Thomas had failed to observe and respect the grounds of his neighbor. This is one of many acts of discipline the six-year-old Gideon had committed, from pulling off fingernails with toy tweezers to constructing fake nooses out of licorice (fortunately, the rope broke when he tried to hang Fatima Bashar off of the monkey bars). His parents always excused his behavior as just a boy playing rough, he did grow up with three brothers after all.

So when the news came out about the mass suicide, investigators speculated that it was Father Freeman's doing. His insatiable thirst for divine discipline had taken over and he felt as if his community had failed God's test. Maybe that was part of the reason, but my ideas involve a concept that involves all of us. To put it simply, they'll be back. They'll be back, and this time we're coming with them. Every single one of us. So don't bother hiding, don't bother fighting, don't even pray, because you'll only make things worse. The Day of Judgement is among us, and we've burned down the Garden of Eden.

We’ve been friends for years and used to hang out often, usually at my initiative, but I’ve scaled back, and now we only see each other about three times in a year, despite them living just a 90-minute drive away.

I get that life gets busy with work, family, and other commitments, but it feels like I’m always the one initiating plans, and they often cancel or say they’re “too swamped.” When we do meet, it’s great, and they seem genuinely happy to catch up, but then months go by with barely any contact. I’ve tried suggesting low-effort meetups, like grabbing coffee halfway, but it’s still tough to pin them down.

I wonder if I’m being too sensitive or expecting too much, given how hectic adult life can be. For context, we’re both in our 40s, with kids, and have similar work schedules.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of drift with a friend who’s not *that* far away? How do you handle it without coming off as clingy or making things awkward? Am I overreacting, or is it reasonable to feel let down? Any advice on how to approach this or bring it up with them would be really appreciated. Thanks!

1lh451p,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1lh451p/im_sorry/,I'm sorry,"It's midnight, and I'm writing this with a stick of cigarette in my hand. I don't know, but suddenly I just want to write something up.

There's this girl— she's a very special person to me. She's my friend, but I don't really see her as 'just a friend' for the last couple months now. The second time I met her was during tryouts for a dance competition our school was joining in. At that time I was just fresh out of a relationship. And I didn't see much of her, because she was in a relationship that time. To me, she was just a teammate. Also out of respect to my friend who was also in the team, I couldn't dare to try something to his girlfriend. I said 'the second time', because it wasn't actually the first time we met. We were actually in the same daycare together when we were kids. She just couldn't bring up that topic because she was actually  shy to talk to me about it. But when it was brought up, it was actually the beginning of the us developing a deep bond. We became friends. That year we won 1st runner up in the competition, and that just made our bond deeper. We celebrated, hang out, and just spent some quality time together, even after the competition. We kept in touch, and actually just be friends. A year later, we joined the same competition. Same set of dancers, still familiar faces. At that time she and my friend broke up. But I still didn't see her with romantic interests out respect for my friend. We lost that year's competition, and it was devastating. We were so full of expectations and hope because of our previous victory. After the competition she came to me. She cried in my arms, and I comforted her saying: ""it's okay, we tried our best"". She couldn't stop crying, and I held her in my hands shedding a couple tears of my own. At that time, despite the devastating lost. It's was the warmest feeling ever. Her being in my hands and just pouring all her sadness onto me. As I hug her, I felt it deep in my soul. I was confused, and filled with guilt at the same time. How could I feel this way to my friend? Nonetheless it's my friend's ex girlfriend too. But I still couldn't let her go, and even wished that this moment will last forever. Couple months pass by, and I still couldn't stop thinking about that feeling. I couldn't stop thinking about her. I kept thinking about it, and eventually I put my mind into it and gathered the courage to actually ask her on a date. We had a fantastic time. We bought coffee, sat beside the river, and talked about whatever comes to mind. I brought her home, gave her a rose and a bar of chocolate. Her trying to hide her smile, being shy about it. It's so vivid to me. I can't stop thinking about that smile, and that I actually made her happy. For such a long time, I haven't felt that kind of feeling. The whole night after that date, I kept thinking and thinking. And finally set up my mind. She's the one, she's the girl I want to spend the rest of my life with. And I've never been so sure of anything in my entire life. I gathered the courage once again to ask her for another date. But something changed about her. She asked a lot of things like: ""are you serious about this?"", ""is there a meaning behind this?"", ""please tell me what you want"". And I did. I told her that I don't want us to stay as 'just friends', and that I actually want to take the next step with her. She rejected me. She apologized, and asked if we can stay as friends, and just to go back to what we were. She thought that the first date that we had was just a friendly date, and that it wasn't in a romantic way of sort. And at that time I wasn't really affected. I set up my mind prior to that, and I was ready for her answer whether it'd be between the two. I said it's fine, and that we'd definitely go back to what we were. But the feelings I didn't feel when she rejected me, came and haunted me at night. Every night after she rejected me, those feelings still haunts me till now. I restricted her in every social media, trying to move on and forget about her entirely. Trying to keep my self busy, just to forget about those feelings. And in the past couple weeks I really have been busy, so busy that it's tiring. I keep my self occupied doing work for this fundraising campaign I started, it was one of the things we talked about on our first date. But it's tiring. I'm tired. And every break I get, I think about her. Thinking that maybe if things worked out between us, maybe she'd be by my side. She'd be my rest. And I'd be her's too, because that's just all I ever wanted. I'd be there for her happy moments, celebrate her endeavors together, and just with her through her sad times as well. She'd tell me about her days, share her pain, and just be with her at most. And this fundraising campaign that I started, makes me think if I'm really doing this to help others. Maybe I'm just using other people to forget about her, or maybe if I give enough to others it'd make them love me. And maybe that love I receive from others, will fill the hole she left in my heart. I know I'm not a kind person, but I'm not all bad either. I'm still human, I have a heart, and a soul. And I think that if I don't talk about this to anyone, or just express these feelings. It'll just build up, and something I don't want to happen might happen all of a sudden. And in the process I'd hurt myself, or maybe even other people. And I don't want that. I feel lost, and I still keep on thinking if I should talk to her one more time about giving me a chance. Maybe she'll reject me a couple of times, but then maybe eventually she'll really give us a chance. Or maybe I did the right thing by running away, to keep both of us from inevitable pain. Thank you for listening. I don't know where this story might reach, but if it reaches her, I just want to say that: J, I'm sorry. I said all those things about us going back to normal, but I just can't do it. I still love you, and I don't think we can go back to what we used to be. I wish the best for you and your future endeavors, and know that I'm always somewhere out there supporting you. ",0,1750532620.0,writers,6,0.42,False

I'm mostly talking about being uncomfortable around really sleepy/too tired to respond kind of behavior, not specifically related to drug usage. 

This is one of those weird trauma ""quirks"" where I know exactly where it comes from, but I wonder if anyone else struggles with the same thing, as I don't hear it talked about a lot. (Trauma dumping ahead.)

I dealt with a lot different kinds of neglect as a kid. My mom was a single working mother for a good chunk of my childhood, and with that came her working a lot of different jobs, long hours, and being overworked and absent, on top of her already out of control mental health issues. I have a few very specific memories of her being too tired to take care of me, all in different scenarios and at different ages.

First time, I was barely in school, probably no older than 5 or 6. She was working overnights at a factory, and before she was able to put me to bed that night, she fell asleep on the couch. I remember shaking her and trying to wake her up, but all she was able to do was sleep talk nonsense at me, which scared me even more. The memory ends with me crying alone on the bathroom floor until I'm finally loud enough for her to hear me.

Another time, I was a preteen visiting her for the summer after my dad had obtained custody of me (another story for another time lol). I did a dumb preteen thing and drank a little liquid container of coffee creamer because I thought it would be funny, and it resulted in the worst stomach pain I'd ever felt in my life. I was hurting so bad, I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital, and desperately tried to wake my mom up to ask for help. She had recently started some high dose sleeping meds and I couldnt get more than a sympathetic grunt from her before she started snoring again. I laid on the futon and dealt with the pain for several hours that night until it finally began to pass around daylight. 

The final time, I was around 16. My mom invited me over to her house for Thanksgiving and I was already dreading it due to how much our relationship had deteriorated by that point. Not even 5 minutes into eating, she began nodding off into her plate and I had to call my dad to come pick me up early. She claims to this day she had taken nothing unprescribed, and I don't know if she's telling the truth or not.

All this trauma dumping to say, I dealt with a lot of weird situations where the person who I was supposed to trust the most was too exhausted for various reasons to engage with me, and it left me with a weird trauma response. Its been a while since I've been in a long term relationship, but last time I was, I remember being extremely anxious and uncomfortable when they would go to bed before me. If they were extra tired after work one day and wanted to go straight to bed, that would send me into a spiral that, at the time, I didn't know the reason for or how to explain to myself that nothing was wrong. I would get so triggered, I'd get sent right back to that little 5 year old shaking his mom with tears in his eyes because he was afraid to be alone. There seems to have been a wire that got crossed where now my brain sees sleepiness = abandonment for me, and it took me a long time to see where the wiring got mixed up, lol.

I wonder if anyone else developed this kind of response after growing up with neglectful parents. I know a lot of people with addict parents had similar experiences due to their parents' drug usage, but I really haven't seen anyone talk about it leaving them with a similar trigger.",1,1750532619.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

The Illusion of You

At first, he was everything she’d ever wanted—charming, generous, attentive. But over time, the cracks began to show. What unfolded wasn’t a whirlwind—it was a slow, calculated unraveling. Jack wasn’t just controlling—he was a narcissist, expertly weaving chaos and doubt until Avery no longer recognized herself. This is the story of how love became manipulation—and how she found the strength to escape before it destroyed her completely.


CHAPTER: CUSTOMER SERVICE

“How was everything today?"" I asked the surly gentleman who minutes earlier was devouring a stack of blueberry pancakes, turkey sausage, and a side of fruit.

“‘It was all right,” he replied in a monotone I knew too well.

Obviously, it wasn’t.

“If you don't tell me I can't fix it,” I pleaded, my eyes locked with his, anticipating his response.

“Well, since you asked—the mango was rotten. Everything else was fine.”

""No worries, we can certainly take care of that.” I flashed a grin at him while voiding the fruit off his final bill.

“That brings the total to nineteen forty-four, sir.”

I waited for him to reach for his wallet, but he wasn’t finished.

“Really I prefer the other location, the one in Dry Creek, the original,” he smirked.

My heart sank. Of course I knew the one—Dry Creek. The place I was never allowed to visit. The one she ran. The one they built together. The one that always had better sales.

Although Jack and I didn't build this Roosters, I certainly felt like a part of it.

He'd only been open a few months when I started, enough that the business was steady on the weekends, but still building. There were still kinks to be worked out. Nothing major, but after being promoted to manager, I’d made some small suggestions that helped things flow better. Helped establish a rhythm.

“Here you are,” pancakes said, extending a 20.00 bill.

“The rest is for the waitress,” he said, dropping the twenty onto the counter. The bell chimed as the door swung shut behind him.

""You handled that real well, hun,"" Doris said, saluting me with her coffee cup. “Like a true professional.""

Doris wasn’t technically staff, but you wouldn’t know it. She’d been coming to Roosters every day, sometimes twice a day since we opened. Claimed she used to wait tables “back in the day”—and whether that was true or just nostalgia talking, no one questioned it. She’d get up from her booth without hesitation, grab a rag or a coffee pot, and start making the rounds like she was still clocked in.

“Y’all look short today,” she’d say, already reaching for the sugar caddies.

Roosters was always short-staffed, and Doris—old as she was—moved like she had something to prove.

The new girls were usually confused by her, but we all knew better. Doris was part of the furniture, and Roosters wouldn’t be Roosters without her.

I smiled, wiping my hands on a towel and taking in the familiar buzz of the room. The clink of mugs, the murmur of regulars, Doris humming along to the oldies station playing overhead.

And then, as if summoned by my thoughts—

Jack walked in, phone in hand, scrolling like always. He glanced up, catching my eye with a quick, practiced smile.

“How'd we do today?” he asked, tucking the phone away, giving me his full attention—or the illusion of it, at least. “Any complaints?”

“Just one,” I said, placing the last wrapped set of silverware aside. “A man that normally goes to Dry Creek location complained about the mango being rotten.""

I looked at him, his lip twisted just at the mention of Dry Creek.

He looked around the restaurant, mentally tallying the inventory, the staff, the customers. Always running numbers.

“Alright,” he said finally, nodding as if deciding something. “We’ll run to H-E-B and restock. I’ve gotta stop by the bank first, though, so just meet me there.”

I nodded. No questions. That was the routine.

But somehow, he was always there before me.

Even when he wasn’t supposed to be.

I parked and walked in, and sure enough, he was already inside—standing in the fruit aisle, like he’d been there for hours, texting with one hand, tapping a cantaloupe with the other.

He smiled when he saw me. “They’ve got great lookin’ mangos today.”

I smiled back, feeling that warm flicker I always got when he noticed details like that.

I dropped my phone into the cart’s cup holder without thinking—just like I always did—then slid my purse into the child seat, that wire-framed basket every mom knows by heart.

We walked the produce section like a couple. Like coworkers. Like whatever we were pretending to be that day. It felt easy. Comfortable.

We laughed about overpriced honeycrisp apples and debated whether anyone actually liked cantaloupe.

Moments like that reminded me why it felt so good with him. Why it felt real.

We checked out, the conversation still flowing as we left the store.

Outside, we pushed the carts to our respective cars, Jack's eyes glimmering as they met mine.

“I’ll take yours,” Jack said, taking my cart before I had time to object.

“Thanks,” I said, pulling the bags from the basket.

He wheeled it away like he was just being thoughtful.

He was already waiting when I pulled into Roosters. He always was.

Jack stood outside his SUV, arms crossed, looking casual. Like it was just another day.

As I parked, he walked over to the Audi. I rolled the window down, and he leaned against my door like he had all the time in the world.

He glanced around first—quick and deliberate—like he was checking for witnesses.

The secrecy thrilled me once. Lately, it just made me tired.

Then he kissed me. Soft. Familiar. Too familiar.

Before I could say a word, he pulled back and handed me my phone.

“Here,” he said. “You must’ve left it in the cart.”

I blinked. “Really? I could’ve sworn—”

“You did,” he said smoothly. “Found it up by customer service.”

And just like that, the lie was laid out, smooth as cream.

He smiled, shut my door like a gentleman, and walked off toward the restaurant—cool as ever.

I looked down at the phone in my hand.

No missed calls. No texts. Just that quiet, queasy feeling in my gut. The one I never quite knew what to do with.

I didn’t realize I’d left my phone in the cart—but then again, I hadn’t checked.

My note was nothing too boring and I love bright, effect inks. I really enjoy expanding my collection with new colors to try. Also came with a free Kakuno!

Inks Included:
Diamine Red Dragon - Very nice deep red color(photo makes it look like a brighter red, more between Diamine Oxblood and Crimson imo). Appears to have shading from trying with Sailor Hocoro.

Diamine Season's Greetings(Sheen) - Deep cool toned green with reddish/purple sheen. May have some shading but is hard to tell from swatches.

DeAtramentis Coffee - Not really a ""coffee"" color, more like a coffee nut color I think. Scented but I don't really smell anything. Very nice softer, legible brown

Noodler's Southwest Sunset - Not really a huge fan of this brand or formula, the inks like to feather in my experience. I do enjoy this color, it's similar to a Quinacridone Gold which is my favorite watercolor paint color. Lot's of shading

Jacques Herbin Rouge Grenat - I LOVE this color. My overall favorite red in is Human Issues from Wearingeul. This ink is very similar but with a tiny shift over to a more deep pinkish red than a true red. Seems to have some shading. Really excited to ink this one up to try (:

Pilot Iroshizuku Yama - Budo - Very nice floral pink leaning purple with gold sheen. Definitely want to ink this one for summer writing.

Rohrer & Klingner Blau Permanent - Not going to lie I thought I wouldn't enjoy this one since I expected it to be a plain waterproof blue. It's actually one of my favorites from these samples. Beautiful true lapis lazuli/ultramarine blue with lots of different hues in the swatch. Appears to have shading. Really want to ink this one up for art to use with my watercolors.

Overall very happy with my purchase! Really hope there are some of the bigger sized boxes available next time to get!

The realization hits you like an oblivious driver hits an unsupervised child. Emerges the question, who is the sorry soul cast with the burden behind the demise of innocent, pure, fresh life. Surely, it couldn’t be the driver, who had no way of knowing that a small body would spontaneously run onto the road in chase of a ball, vibrantly striped yellow and red against the pavement. What about the parents, shouldn’t they have been paying close attention to their child, or rejecting his endless pleads to go play outside? No, you can’t blame the parents. They were overwhelmed with the jobs that house and feed them on top of the bills, the taxes, the judgment, the hassling. Too much was on their backs for it to be their fault. Afterall, it might just be their first time living too. Maybe it’s the child’s own doing, who absentmindedly ran onto the street, forgetting to look left and right like they’re taught in preschool or those obnoxious television programs. Of course not, children are just mere masses of flesh who weren’t give enough time to comprehend that they are closer to death by the second, one way or another. Brains limited to simplicity. In those 24.3 seconds, that ball was all his universe was, slowly drifting away from him. *Chase the ball, that is your purpose, that is all that matters.* 

Was it the teenage cashier at the grocery store who offishly sold the ball to the boy’s mother? Was it the pale-skinned European factory worker who painted the red and yellow stripes onto it? This is a stupid train of thought. No matter who or what is to blame, the accident was fatal. Life was deprived of a mind yet to develop, while those who developed long ago were left with feelings of misery and mourning that would eat them up until every last shred of skin was decayed beneath 6 feet of dirt. But it’s all God’s plan, right? Maybe we should count the boy lucky. 

The human brain was cursed with curiosity, questions that will never be answered. If God exists, who is *his* Lord? If God exists, why didn’t he just tell us? Supposedly he left traces of existence, messages sent to the few chosen. That way, only those of true faith will join him in paradise. But if that’s the case, why did he stop? We don’t see Prophets in this day and age. Perhaps holy history is made up of hallucinations, perhaps the excruciating heat of Mecca led to deranged visions, and the unfortunate Moroccan man was just another tragic example of the human capacity to hate. Hate. It can’t exist without love/ Everyone who hates must love, even if it’s small and insignificant. 

The idea that religion is merely a coping mechanism is not revolutionary nor that uncommon, so why do I feel so guilty for thinking outside the box? If you have faith that the box is salvage, then once you take your final breath, there is nothing to lose if you were wrong the entire time. And the cat inside the box, well she's both dead and alive until you open it. I always believed that thought experiment was stupid, until I realized that’s the whole point. Your observation isn’t in line with the forces of nature, especially your uncertainty. Perhaps the men of our society are made up of Judge Holdens, who hate the idea that something may exist without their knowledge. 

I’m sorry. I’ve rambled as per usual. I won’t tell you my name, simply because I don’t see how that would help fulfill my purpose. My purpose is to tell you a story. This is the story of how the red and yellow striped ball was never what we thought it was. The smell of freshly cut green grass, the blood-stained sunset dimming the clouds, the shining skin navy blue truck becoming indented, were all the beginning of our eternal punishment. Don’t search for tiny holes of white light, for they slowly started to close up. We can not escape this. But for some reason, amidst our putrescence, I see you beside me. You’ve always looked after me, your figure is hard to make out, like a slight blur in the mirror. Infinity is lost, so with the time we have left, I suppose we’re all owed a bit of an explanation, especially you.

November 28th, 1996. “The Eyes of Providence.” That’s what they called themselves. They lived in rural Utah, a great big farm they built for themselves. It was a beautiful scene, really, at least from what the pictures said. The sky was always a bondi blue, the sun created a peaceful yellow blanket of life against grass and skin. They kept animals, these big brown cows, white horses with long silky manes, dogs who would cool themselves in the moist soil, and butterflies. Pink, orange, and purple butterflies with black lines creating floral patterns in their wings and white dots like stars in the midnight sky. The farm building was deep red, like the ones you see in cartoons or eyesight tests. The EoP, that’s what I’ll refer to them as from here. The men had shoulder length hair and beards like brown sheep’s wool, they wore white robes that fell over their bodies like creamer into coffee. The women also wore white dresses, not the wedding type, but with gloves and bonnets and veil-like fabric that tinted their faces the color of clay. They were all always smiling, and it wasn’t the forced kind as if they were being held against their will. Their expressions were genuine, of those who felt the pure love of their supposed divine Father. 

“And now for our next segment we strongly advise viewer discretion and especially if there are any children present. As of the early morning, November 29th, 1996, the infamous cult known at The Eyes of Providence in rural Utah have partaken in a mass suicide. The farmhouse in which the one-hundred-and-thirty-five members resided in was intentionally set ablaze.” 

*And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am, John 14:3* 

Their leader was Gideon Freeman, a charming man who saw God in all his glory, and his filth. They called him Father Freeman, he was raised in an atheist household. A drunk father, an emotionally absent mother, siblings who he never heard from again after highschool, your typical American white-trash family. When Gideon was a young boy, he was hit by a truck outside of their suburban home. He spent 5 months in a coma, and when he finally came to he was never quite the same. This was the start of what his teachers would label “temper-tantrums,” but I’d rather refer to them as what they were: violent outbreaks. He loved to draw, but his pieces weren’t lazy crayola dinosaurs and rocketships, they were visual representations of Hell itself. People were engulfed in flames, screaming in sheer agony, crying for their mothers to come pull them out of this never-ending torture as their flesh became a jet-black char. When asked about these drawing, Gideon always assured his horrified classmates that they deserved to be there, the pain was only a result of ignorance. What really worried his teachers, though, was that he took it upon himself to handle the wrongdoings of his peers. Thomas Peterson was quite the energetic boy, he loved planes, helicopters, trucks, anything that would allow someone to travel without using their own two feet. One day, Thomas rammed his plastic G.I. Joe into Gideon’s fanciful church made from wooden blocks. All in good fun… is what Thomas thought. Gideon pinned him to the ground and jammed a freshly sharpened pencil into his left eye, for little Thomas had failed to observe and respect the grounds of his neighbor. This is one of many acts of discipline the six-year-old Gideon had committed, from pulling off fingernails with toy tweezers to constructing fake nooses out of licorice (fortunately, the rope broke when he tried to hang Fatima Bashar off of the monkey bars). His parents always excused his behavior as just a boy playing rough, he did grow up with three brothers after all.

So when the news came out about the mass suicide, investigators speculated that it was Father Freeman's doing. His insatiable thirst for divine discipline had taken over and he felt as if his community had failed God's test. Maybe that was part of the reason, but my ideas involve a concept that involves all of us. To put it simply, they'll be back. They'll be back, and this time we're coming with them. Every single one of us. So don't bother hiding, don't bother fighting, don't even pray, because you'll only make things worse. The Day of Judgement is among us, and we've burned down the Garden of Eden.

Poured a cup of coffee, logged onto my Varrock Sugar Basket account and noticed over my shoulder that my dad was gearing up for something PvM related. 

Now, he’s much more knowledgeable than I am. Irl and about the game, so seeing him sort through his high level gear with effort peaked my interest. I watched him for a good five minutes take gear out and put it away before I asked him what he was doing. He said a new boss, Yama, had just dropped that morning. He was trying to guess what would be the most effective. 

He made his selections and headed to the boss. The fight looked so cool, despite what would end up being his errors in initial gear choice. He seemed to love it, and so did I just watching. 

I don’t have much experience outside of training cooking, fletching logs or using the back of my rune axe on the Apothecary’s house in Varrock, so getting a taste of high level PvM first hand was so neat and makes me want to try it. 

Over the last few weeks, I’ve watched almost all of his kills. He got the pet on 665 (so close to being perfect) and has most of the armor. He just hit 1000 kills today. 

Anyone else’s dad’s grinding out Yama? My mom got him Frogtart’s Pizza as a celebration for his 1000 kill count. It’s almost become a family celebration at this point. ",1,1750532259.0,2007scape,11,0.52,False

1lh3xrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lh3xrd/aitah_for_always_being_sad/,AITAH for always being “sad”?,"Hey i need some advice. English is not my first language so pls bare with me. 

To start i want to mention i lost my ability smell like 5 years ago.(idk if its the right word for it). And yes it was because covid. I actually made peace with it.

So i (18f) recently go out with my friends A(f), G(m),E(f) and R(f)(same age as me). The place we went was in a field of flowers. And there were a lot of lavender. Now lavender was and still is my favorite flower. So i was just feeling a bit down, i wanted to smell it again so bad and yes i know it might sound dramatic but i got a bit teary eyed. I excused myself and went to toilet before they saw me like that. As i said i made peace with it but it was my first time seeing too many flowers like that after i lost my ability smell.

When i come back to table my friends were silent. I thought they were just relaxing in this beautiful place. When our coffee came i tried to make small talks but G interrupted me by saying “You ruined everything” i was a bit shocked and asked him what was his problem. I dont remember the exact words he said but to cut it short he told me i always have sad face and tear for everything like a cringe and a pick me girl. I told him that i really dont have any energy to fight him over this subject but to my suprise A and R also joined him saying things like yeah we got u have problem with smelling but arent you making it too big problem. After that things said i just got up and went to field to cool down. E followed me and told me they had enough of me asking them how things smell. This whole time i cried and asked her if i was really making too much fuss about it and she just nodded. After that i turned back and left.

They didnt text me but E did and apologized for things she said to me and apparently she said when i went to bathroom G talked behind my back and said things like she couldnt even stand for 5 minutes before crying. E also told me that they felt disturbed when i asked them if a perfume i bought new smelt good or when i asked if i smell bad. She said she loves me as a company but she cant see me as one of her besties and left it like that.

Now to be clear i was insecure about my smell after i lost my ability to smell. These people were my friends from elementary school. I really thought them as my best friends. When i didnt went out after covid like 2 years they were here to help me. When i became too overweight they were the one who helped me getting in diet and gym. I dont know what changed like they werent so shy when they told me overweight but suddenly they are bothered by me asking if i smelt bad or a perfume smells good? 

After i talked with E(like a week later with no words), our mutual friend K(f) wrote me. She is G’s girlfriend. She told me recently they went on a double date with K, G and A(with match for A), A was showing some prom fotos we took in prom month earlier and A’s match asked who i was and as she said A answered with “oh she is the fat and sad one”. K told me she tried to change to subject and just wanted me to learn what she said behind my back.

Im really sad by this. When E asked me about the boy she liked i was honest with her and told her i dont know the guy, or when R came out i supported her. I have never said anything to their love life. I have never been lover with someone so i thought they didnt saw me like “that fat girl friend who thinks she can control others”. 

They always told me i had sad face. I really didnt understand it but now i think they meant how i look or my behavior. I really dont know the problem i dont wanna cut them off. They are my only close friends even though they dont see me like that. We were really close before. I know people can change but it was all of a sudden. If you guys ask me if i cry when we go out my answer is yes, i used to cry everytime we went out because of my lost ability. Yes i accept i cried like 2 years but i changed. These past 3 years i  only cried things weren’t related to my lost ability. And it wasnt constant at all. I dont know the problem. 

So after i talked with K i was anxious and text them if everything was good. And they talked like nothing happened. I tried to talk about the issue but they acted like these incidents never happened. And i asked them directly if i was being dramatic to them. I believe G had enough and texted Why i cant get over things and why i always sad. I asked him what he meant and he told me i always look sad and be sad, everything round around me i asked him if i did something wrong and why is he acting like this he just wrote(i translated it) 

“Op we love you but u look sad and always cringe like when u cried seeing a field of flowers or when u cried because u couldnt select perfumes. We can understand your pain but u are narcissistic. You always try to look better. Like when i said i wanted a home with garden and u said u worked for a month in florist and it would be great. Things dont round around you. Every conversation we have turns into how u did things better in past but now u are useless in ur word. If u wanna countine this friendship pls get help from professional. You are undiagnosed narcissist we believe so pls get check out”.
After he wrote this i asked others in group if this was  their shared opinion as they didnt say anything to this message. E wrote she joins half but she said i look sad. After others in group agreed i just left the group. 

I may understand why they think im narcissistic and im working on it but why always sad? I mean like yes someone can act narcissistic and u can say it to their faces but what is being called sad face? As if i cry always. I agree i did but cmon it was 3 years ago. Im trying to change and like i said i only cried in spesific things and it wasnt always. I really need advice here. 

(To let you guys understand why they think im narcissistic is because of few incidents and i know i was wrong as my sister also said it. But let me give a example of one (another) our mutual friend liked a boy and i learned from one of his friend he also liked her. I talked with him behind her back asked him if he liked her and he said he did and i told him she also liked him. They actually started dating but i heard she saying behind my back she wished she herself said this to him as she also knew he liked her back. So yeah i was being asshole here but it was only incident about love. Other incident is it was E s birthday and we planned suprise party. She wasnt home and her mom take us in we waited and she entered to home (i was holding the cake and K, R blow confetti) when confetti blow i screamed so loud it was really embarrassing but they blowed it near my ear. Im not hearing everyday blow of confeti so yeah i tried to justify but i thought we passed this.) ",0,1750532112.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

Example: You walk into a local café. (Di halata yung hilig ko sa kape at this point haha) Anyway. The coffee tastes burnt, service is slow. You talk about this and tell the baristas but you’re met with “Support local nalang, dami mo pang kuda eh.”

Here’s the thing - supporting mediocrity isn’t actually supporting local businesses, artists, products. It’s enabling them to stay mediocre. When we hide behind “support local” to excuse poor quality, we’re creating a culture where “pwede na” becomes the standard.

And that’s the opposite of what true support looks like. Real support means: celebrating excellence when we see it, giving constructive feedback when we don’t, and believing our local talents can compete at the highest level. It’s holding ourselves to elevated standards.

SB19 gets this. They didn’t just show up today asking for support because they’re Filipino. They showed up because they’ve been relentlessly pursuing excellence - in their craft, performance, and artistry. The support follows naturally.

Which brings me to point two: “Pinoy Pride” as a battlecry. I’ve noticed something lang kasi-- the more you have to announce your pride, the less confident you actually sound. It’s like constantly saying “I’m funny” instead of just being funny.

Feeling ko lang kasi — when you’re on an international stage shouting “PINOY PRIDE!” to a global audience, you’re essentially saying “Please pay attention to me because of my nationality” rather than “Please pay attention to me because of my art and message.”

But here’s what SB19 does differently: They let their Filipino identity flow naturally through their authentic expression. Their experiences, stories, and artistry carry the Filipino spirit without needing to announce it constantly.

It reminds me of Rick Rubin’s principle: “The audience comes last.” Create from your authentic truth first. Express your real experiences, vulnerabilities, thoughts. The connection with audiences happens organically when you’re genuinely yourself.

I mean, being Filipino is already rich enough diba? Our natural warmth, storytelling, resilience, creativity, humor - these shine through when we’re authentic. You don’t need to parade these qualities; you embody them.

I mean — Would you rather hear “LOOK AT MY PINOY ART EVERYONE!” or “These are my authentic thoughts and experiences. I’d like to invite you into my world”? Kasi I feel like art is not self expression lang eh - it’s self expression that invites people in a world. Your world.

When artists create to attract attention, it feels forced. When they create to invite people into their truth, it feels magnetic. SB19 has mastered this invitation - their Filipino identity is woven into their authenticity.

Excellence speaks its own language. When you show up excellent every single time, whether sa local gig or international stage, the pride follows naturally. People don’t need to guess your background - they feel it in your work.

But just to be clear: This isn’t about abandoning Filipino pride. *It’s about expressing it through excellence rather than slogans. It’s about being so good at what you do that your identity becomes part of your artistry, not separate from it.*

SB19 today didn’t just represent the Philippines - they invited the world to experience Filipino artistry through their lens. That’s the difference between performing your identity and living it.

So here’s my challenge to more Filipino creatives out there: Instead of asking “How can I make this more obviously Filipino?” Ask: “How can I make this more authentically me?” Your Filipino experience is already part of your authentic self.

Support local by commending excellence. Show pinoy pride through consistent growth and authentic expression. Create art that invites rather than announces. This is how we elevate not just individual artists, but our entire creative landscape.

SB19’s Taipei Arena moment wasn’t historic because they waved the flag the loudest. It was historic because they earned their place through undeniable talent, preparation, and authentic artistry. That’s the standard we should all aspire to.

Here’s to more Filipino artists who understand: the world doesn’t owe us attention because we’re Filipino. We earn it by being undeniably good.

I have a Peugot 1930s/1940s coffee grinder that works great. The grind adjustment is a nut mounted right below the crank handle you use hand turn for grinding. Very simple and opposite of Zassenhaus.

Push down on the nut (it's spring loaded). Hold it down and turn CLOCKWISE for fine grind. Adjust upward (Counter clockwise) for coarse. Easy Peasy.

Older Zassenhaus are the opposite. You turn the adjustment nut (not spring loaded) counter clockwise for finest grind and clockwise to get it coarser.

Eyeball the catcher drawer below to see your results early on or just a week or less of use and you'll be dialed in.

These old grinders are work horses, very easy to use and produce good coffee. This is specifically posted for folks going this route (lots out there off reddit) but on the Peugot, hard to find directions for the older models.  Cleaning it up, ran minute rise through it, wipe with some soap on a sponge, paper towel to dry, some sunshine and good to go.

I have disassembled the Zassenhaus and due to age and such that required using screwdriver , careful use at one point of a vice grip and vice to free the blades up but once it was apart, cleaned up nicely with light brillo (blades), soap and water, dry--reassemble. On the Zassenhaus, to clean the internal wood where the beans touched, fine sand paper worked wonders, bit of diluted vinegar , disinfected, soap water too, not too wet, good to go. Minute rice is fine for an initial clean on medium coarse. Once you have the feel of grinding, run again with minute rice on a fine grind. Works. Run some Aldi Beans through after---light roast or any other bad beans (will remove any rice residue you'r e worried about--or good beans if you're not cheap--throw that away....seasoned.",2,1750531148.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1lh3iib,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lh3iib,Cocoa Streusel Coffee Cake and Savory Palmiers with Blitz Rough Puff (Week 25),"COCOA STREUSEL COFFEE CAKE

A total hit and a delight to make. Noting it was written for an 8 cup Bundt and I only have an 11, I took the risk of scaling up the recipe. (I’ll post the upscaled ingredients figures I used into a comment.)

Easy to work with batter. I did adjust a couple of things to my typical approach, which was: (1) to beat the eggs more than I usually would after adding (I guess toward ribboning) and (2) beat the batter a little more than usual after incorporating flour. (I had always head the conventional wisdom for cakes of beating as little as possible once the flour was incorporated for tenderness; however, I’ve also read occasionally how professional cake bakers think home bakers don’t allow for enough gluten development. I took a risk of about 30 seconds of beating and think it paid off.)

I didn’t have currents and opted to take the combined weight of fruit and nut, and split 50/50 mini chocolate chips and chopped pecans. Worked beautifully. 

The recipe forgot to include cooling instructions, so I referred to the cooling for the sticky toffee pudding recipe for guidance. It worked, and I only had one tear. (I had buttered and floured my Bundt.)

Inspired by the photo in the book, I finished with a simple glaze of confectioners sugar, milk, and vanilla. Next time I might add orange oil. 

This coffee cake was a total hit at Friday night dinner with adults and kids alike asking for second slices. 10/10 will make again.

SAVORY PALMIERS 
Pesto and Parmesan, Prosciutto and Parmesan

Delightful to use the other half batch of my rough puff (which needs work in the puff department—100°F+ days are not helping me keep a cool kitchen, either…).

Opted to fill with some homemade pesto I had on hand, and some with prosciutto and parm. 

I refrigerated the photographed batch overnight after filling, mostly because I ran out of time on the way to dinner. They took longer to bake off but I can’t tell if it helped anything or just didn’t matter because the lamination had already melted out…

Anyway! A fun, quick appetizer (especially if you have frozen puff pastry on hand… and can plan enough ahead to thaw it.)",4,1750530992.0,BakingSchoolBakeAlong,0,1.0,False
1lh3ifr,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlieonthemove/comments/1lh3ifr/views_over_rio_de_janeiro/,Views over Rio de Janeiro,"# Different perspectives on Rio

The typical image of Rio de Janeiro is an aerial view that includes the statue of Christ, the Sugar Loaf Mountain and majestic buildings along a seemingly endless beach. Words that come to mind are sunshine, beach life, paradise – or simply what dreams are made of.

During Charlie’s visit she quickly realized that there was more to the city of Rio de Janeiro than what meets the eye at first sight. She took Portuguese lessons. She played Volleyball with the locals on the beach. She lived in a host family. She visited a favela. And she got a view over the city from different angles. It does make a difference if you see Rio from the statue of Christo Redentor, from the top of the Sugar Loaf, from the Chinese Viewpoint in Tijuca Forest or from the *Parque das Ruínas* in Santa Teresa.

# How to move around Rio de Janeiro

How to get to all these places though? The best and safest way to move around in Rio is by Uber. Depending on the time of day, there can be a lot of traffic, so plan ahead and request the Uber early. The time estimations in the app were always incorrect for Charlie and you should add at least 10 minutes to the estimated time of arrival.

Phone robberies really are a concern in Rio and it is recommended to request the Uber from inside a building. As the car arrives, put your phone away and then walk outside. You shouldn’t be scared in Rio but always pay attention to your surroundings and think twice before getting your valuables out.

# Public transportation in Rio de Janeiro

When it comes to public transport, the Metro is the safest way to get around and you can easily tap in and out with a contactless card. If you prefer, you can get metro tickets in every station. The ticket is a plastic card too. You simply tap this card and then insert it into the machine before passing through the gates. The card will be re-used.

The Metro in Rio also has separate carriages that are women-only during peak times. You will see signs on the floor at the platform to know where to enter to get to this particular carriage. Inside the Metro stations, there is WiFi and it is safe to get your phone out. When you exit the Metro station however, you should act with caution. This can be tricky because some Metro exits might be closed, and you might have to exit through the opposite side of the station. Once outside, you might need the help of Google Maps for orientation and directions.

# Walking around Rio de Janeiro

Between Copacabana and Ipanema where tourists mostly stay, everything is walkable. Be sure to get shoes with a good profile. Charlie doesn’t know how the locals can walk around all day in flip-flops. She would have had blisters and pain.

The tricky bit might be directions. You should not get your phone out on the side of the street because you won’t see a phone thief coming on a motorcycle. Try to memorise as much of your journey beforehand. It was a good memory exercise for Charlie to see up to which corner she could remember the way. She used street names and shops or restaurants as reference points. If you can’t remember any further, step inside a shop, then get your phone out to look at the map.

At night, please take an Uber!

# Getting to the city from the airport

If you are flying into RioGaleão (GIG), the best way to get into the city is by Uber. You can easily follow the signs in the airport to reach the Uber parking area. Charlie paid around USD 15 for this journey.

If you are flying into Santos Dumont Airport (SDU), there is a tram you can take. Charlie didn’t fly from this airport and she hasn’t taken this tram. It was recommended by her language teacher though and was labelled as a safe means of transport.

# Tijuca National Park

In many ways, Rio reminded Charlie of [Las Palmas](https://charlieonthemove.com/en/surfing/gran-canaria/): a vibrant city, close to the sea and the surf and close to mountains and nature. In Rio, there is even more of the latter. The Tijuca forest is a national park and a rain forest within the limits of the city of Rio de Janeiro. As such, it is a popular destination for day trips and hikes. There’s lots to see and do.

Charlie didn’t stay long enough in Rio to explore the national park through multiple hikes. Instead, she booked a guided tour that mostly consisted of driving along the main road in the forest and a bit of hiking to see a cave from the inside. It was a small group of only 6 participants and the guide, Rodrigo, showed them all his favourite spots in the forest and pointed out all the different plants they could see. He was also looking for animals, for example monkeys and sloths, but they didn’t see any that day.

They stopped at several waterfalls and enjoyed a shower under one of them. That was a welcome activity after the hike along some steep steps to reach a cave. On the way, they also spotted some rock climbers. They also saw paragliders and hanggliders near the coast and enjoyed stunning views over the mountains and the city from several viewpoints. From the Chinese Viewpoint (*vista chinesa*) they could see the whole city, including the Christ statue and the sugar loaf which from up there seemed to be quite small.

The Tijuca forest isn’t the original forest. After the colonization, the area was used for agriculture, mostly coffee and sugar cane plantations. Reforestation efforts started in the 19^(th) century. Since the rainforest grows quickly, it is hard to imagine that the trees aren’t a thousand years old. If it wasn’t for ruins and parts of what used to be walls around the plantations, you would not notice that this is only a second forest.

# The Statue of Christ and Sugar Loaf

They are probably the most visited places in Rio by tourists and yes, they have aspects of a tourist trap! Expect long queues and wait times at both, the Christ Statue and the Sugar Loaf. That being said, they’re still highly recommended to visit and you wouldn’t want to leave Rio without having enjoyed these views!

# Visiting a favela in Rio de Janeiro

If you’re travelling to Brazil, you have probably heard or seen images of favelas. Contrary to common belief, they’re not a place of constant crime and violence. Some of them have been pacified and it is common for tourists to visit them. In Rio, the favelas of *Rocinha*, *Santa Marta* and *Vidigal* are the most obvious choices. When visiting a favela, it is important to do so with respect and to not take pictures in case of illegal activities. Charlie visited the favela Vidigal as a walking tour with the language school. The views from up there are spectacular too!

# Surfing in Rio de Janeiro

Rio de Janeiro is known for its beaches and the beach culture that comes with it. The best known beaches are Ipanema and Copacabana and they can get crowded. They are considered the most democratic place in Rio where everybody comes together, no matter their social status or whether they’re local or foreign.

Surfing is possible on either side of Arpoador on Ipanema Beach and at Leblon Beach. The wave is breaking very close to shore though and the rides are short. You find surf schools on the beach and it is best to just walk up to them to ask for lessons. You won’t find much information online and their shops are simply tents. Charlie spotted one surf club in a road behind Arpoador. [Guarderia Surf Club](https://guarderiasc.com.br/) is a shop and café and they offer lessons and rental as well as surfboard storage and lockers.

Apart from the waves breaking close to shore, there can also be a lot of rubbish floating near the coast. On one occasion, Charlie decided to not enter the water. It was just too much!

If you are looking for cleaner places, it is better to go bit further North or South of Rio for surfing.

# Street Art in Rio de Janeiro

It doesn’t matter which part of Rio you go to, you will see graffiti and murals everywhere. The most popular part of town for arts of all kinds is Santa Teresa. It appears to be the biggest accumulation of street art and there are small art shops and artist studios as well. The architecture is mostly colonial since it was the first area where the Portuguese settled.

There is also the *Parque das Ruínas* (Maria Gloria Park) with an old building that has been converted into an art gallery with changing exhibitions. From up there, you also get a great view over Down Town Rio, an usual image of the city. To get there, you can take the historic tram from Carioca Station and then stroll around Santa Teresa. Already during the tram journey, you will see plenty of street art.

There are some giant murals around the *Boulevard Olimpico* and in some areas near the port. When Charlie was there, there were a lot of old factories and construction sites. The whole area might change in the near future and the street art might take a new shape.

# Rio de Janeiro for digital nomads

Rio isn’t known yet as a digital nomad community, however, you will find a good community of nomads and expats there to connect with. The best way to find them and get access to the several WhatsApp Groups is via [riodigitalnomads.org](https://riodigitalnomads.org/).

There are coworking spaces in different areas of Rio. If you download and sign up for the [app Station](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wework.user_app&hl=en&pli=1), you get access to multiple coworking spaces and can easily book desks and day passes.

There are no colivings in Rio de Janeiro and the best option for digital nomads is to book a flat on AirBnB. The safest areas (and also well-connected) are Leblon, Ipanema and Copacabana. You can also find AirBnBs for long-term stays in Flamengo and Botafogo.

I LOVE coffee, but it isn't worth it. I want to be able to eat spicy foods again sometimes or have a drink. Or eat some chocolate.

Where do we go from here?,"I met Chris on Snapchat, July 2024. We had so much in common he loves birds, and we both just kind of hit it off via conversation. There was something about him and I could just remember looking at his photos and going man. There’s something about this one. 

He pushed to meet me right away and the first red flag was. I told him that I was busy. I was actually living in my own apartment at this time and I told him that I would need to schedule him, but I couldn’t see him the night of, and I made him very upset.  Come Thursday the day we were supposed to meet. I got ready. I drove 45 minutes to see him. That was my choice.

As I got closer to him, he told me that he would prefer if we jumped in his car, which has executive tinted window. I was automatically kind of set off. I felt unsafe I wasn’t OK with that. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable that I would rather go to a coffee shop and he said no, and I literally turned around and just left.

Amazingly, we still kept in contact and we still spoke for some reason it just wasn’t as much . After a few days, we started speaking again and we were snapping and talking every day every night. He would get jealous. If I posted pictures of myself he didn’t want me making new friends. He wanted me to follow all of his orders.

We would Butthead often because I’m an independent woman because I needed to be in my life coming from an abusive environment. I needed to seek refuge and get on my own 2 feet so I wasn’t in my family’s house anymore.  For some reason, he saw me as someone who had a nice car and was in the process of buying my own home as someone who is low value as he would call me. By the way, he has six kids and he’s divorced.

We scheduled to meet a second time . I drove out there again because he convinced me that I was the problem the first time. He left me waiting for an hour until he showed up so that he was caught up in something and that he wanted me to sit in his car again.
 
I sat in his vehicle. It was a little bit awkward. At first he was making fun of my parking. He told me I didn’t know how to park and that for such an expensive car I could’ve gotten something nicer like his. He told me he wanted to hook up with me and I said I wasn’t sure and that’s when he pinned me down kissed me very hard to a point where his gums started to bleed because he was biting me and I tasted blood. I got him off of me and we somehow still continue the situation because I was very confused and we left it very open ended. 

No one texted each other when we got home. I was still kind of processing what happened and the next day he sent me a Snapchat around noon I guess I didn’t open it in time. He deleted it and I texted him and we continued speaking.  I blocked him and for three weeks I thought about him all the time I made a fake Snapchat account and saw that he was posting subliminals about losing the love of his life and how it was over and how people think he’s a bad man and that he’s really not and that even if he wants a relationship with somebody, it always doesn’t work out.

I went back to him. He accepted me back at this point. I was in my new home about two or three weeks and still getting everything settled and we were speaking again and it felt really good.  Things are better this time he told me what he needed for me in terms of communication. He told me he was very comfortable with me that I was easy to be vulnerable with me. He said that I had it all as a woman and that I was beautiful and Everything was perfect about me.

And things slowly went downhill again. He would just be mean to me and tell me that I was desperate because I wanted to make new friends after my sobriety journey. He would tell me that the best thing for me to do is stay at home. He would hate when I posted pictures of my body as I’m trying to become more confident in my wanking and told me that I was desperate for attention and that there’s some things that only a man should be seeing your man.

At this point every time we would fight he would then say we’re just friends it doesn’t matter anyway . We spoke about meeting up again and having sex and the day of he sent me a snap which was clearly pointing out the fact that he had cold sore. That made me feel uncomfortable and I just did not want to meet up with him because I did not want any cold sores myself. I just wanna point out that all of our conversations happen on Snapchat. He has over 1 million score. He has his business on his Snapchat as well and I guess his account is a hybrid, personal and business account.. 

On Snapchat, he portrays himself to be a very religious man who has family members who are religious coverings, and he adheres to the obligations as a man in his culture, but it appears on Snapchat. The people who he likes are completely different.  I am not a religious woman I like to post my pictures in my bathing suits. I do not adhere to any cultural obligations because I left my religion about a decade ago. I was raised in an extreme mist environment.

So we stopped talking again another three weeks. I’m here thinking what he’s thinking. I reach out to him again and every time I go back to him, he’s meaner, but he always accepts my hand.  After our three or four weeks of no contact I would text him. He would text me back right away. He would say no problem. Let’s be friends. We would add each other on Snapchat and it’s like things would go back to normal.

At this point, we’ve never had sex. We only met those two times that I mentioned there are many times where I went back to him and this is our fourth time of no contact that I asked him. Why don’t you just block me if you’re going to be mean to me and don’t wanna speak to me in which he replies, you’re never a bother. We’re really good friends he never will remove me. He only removed me from Snapchat once and that’s when I ignored him and he went on a hissy fit.

Our most recent time of me blocking was he just did not want to hear me talk about how I felt that it was kind of ridiculous that him and I just keep on speaking to each other. I told him that we don’t get along. He insists that we do, I told him that he should just block me as well and he said he would not do that and then just started sending emoji reactions to me. I got really upset. I sent him a long message. Just basically saying that I was just fed up and how I’m done with these mind games that this is just immature and childish and that I wanted no parts of him and I actually blocked him everywhere. There’s no way he can contact me at this point.

I do have BPD and I do struggle with attachment a lot. Can someone make a little bit of sense of what’s going on here so I could just peacefully keep this guy blocked as he has been for the past three weeks",0,1750530943.0,relationship_advice,3,0.33,False

Here is Part 8 of Our Reality, from the perspective of everyone's favorite red-haired Doki fusion character, Sayuri. Sayuri has breakfast with her cousin Yuri, who shares more of her dreams of owning a business. The Literature Club members go shopping for clothes, Monika and Sayori have some emotional moments, and are Yuri and Natsuki going to have another argument?

**Part 8: Our New Style (Sayuri)**

Sayuri awoke to the sound of the alarm on her phone chiming at 7:30AM. She brushed a strand of blood red hair out of her blue-purple eyes as she reached for the device. Picking up the phone from her dark wood nightstand that featured a marble-look top surface, she shut off the alarm. Outside the curtains of her bedroom, it was a gray winter morning, though snow had not yet begun to fall.

*I wonder if I could get away with another hour of sleep. I still don’t know what that was that woke me up at three this morning…it sounded like someone yelling. Thankfully I fell back asleep quickly.*

She put her head back on the pillow for a brief moment but thought better of it and sat up in bed to start her day. Picking up her phone she typed a message to the group text thread.

*Anyone else up yet and want to grab breakfast?*

After a few minutes with no response from any of the other members of the Literature Club, Sayuri climbed out of bed and walked to the bathroom to shower and get ready for the day ahead. The bathroom featured dark gray tiled flooring with a light marble-look tile on the walls. One wall was covered by a mirror and vanity, while another opened to the shower. She opened the frosted glass door to the shower and was pleasantly surprised to find that the FXI CFO had thoughtfully stocked it with shampoo, conditioner, soap, body wash, and a whole variety of other items that a young woman would want to have on hand.

*That was really nice of her to do that for us so we didn’t have to go looking for basics last night after dinner.*

As Sayuri climbed into the shower, she smiled to herself as a thought occurred to her.

*This is my first shower in the real world. I suppose I can take a bit of extra time and enjoy the hot water since nobody else seems to be up yet.*

 Half an hour later she stepped out of the shower, dried off, brushed her teeth, brushed her hair and put in her signature two small purple bow hair clips, and got dressed.

*No need for the neck ribbon, sweater, or blazer today. I can’t wait to go shopping with the girls and find some cute outfits.*

Sayuri buttoned up her shirt, zipped up her skirt, and put on her socks before walking to her windows and throwing open the curtains. She looked out at the city and down to the park and lake that were across the street from Legacy Tower.

*I’m so lucky to be here. Lucky to even exist at all. I’m going to make the most of this day I’ve been given.*

She picked up her phone and saw that Yuri had replied to her text message.

*I also rose early this morning. Though I remain skeptical of an establishment that sells both coffee and tea, seeing as how I currently lack tea in my home I plan to head upstairs to get a cup of tea. If you would like to join me, I would certainly enjoy the company.*

Sayuri smiled and shook her head in amusement. *Yuri texts like she talks.*

She typed a reply. *Sounds great. I’ll meet you by the escalators.*

Moments later Sayuri met her cousin in the wood-paneled escalator bay that would take them up to the 60th floor. Yuri wore her full uniform and was running her fingers through her hair in an attempt to organize her long, lavender colored locks.

“Hey Yuri, good morning,” Sayuri greeted her with a smile.

*She looks a bit messy this morning. Why is she wearing her full uniform?*

Yuri returned her cousin’s smile. “Good morning, Sayuri. I apologize for my disheveled appearance, but I discovered this morning that due to the length of my hair I am susceptible to something known as ‘bed hair,’ and that it takes a long time for it to dry after showering.”

“No worries,” Sayuri said reassuringly, “It’s just us girls anyway. Did you sleep well last night?”

Yuri nodded. “Indeed, I did. The bedding provided in our homes is extremely comfortable.”

“How come you’re wearing the full uniform?” Sayuri asked, “School’s out and we’re going shopping today for some new outfits anyway.”

Yuri shook her head. “While you are correct, I found this morning that without the sweater and blazer that I felt cold. To that end, shall we go get a hot cup of tea?”

The two cousins headed up the escalator to the 60th floor, which was bustling with morning activity, and quickly arrived at COFFEE TEA TIRAMISU.

Yuri eyed the menu suspiciously as she stepped up to the light wood counter to order, but her expression softened when she noticed that roasted oolong tea was among the establishment’s tea options.

“Welcome to Coffee, Tea, Tiramisu,” the attendant greeted her, “How can I help you today?”

“I would like a cup of the roasted oolong tea, please, along with the ham and cheese croissant.” Yuri said.

“Certainly,” the attendant replied, “Would you like that hot or iced?”

Yuri frowned as if confused by the question. “Hot, of course. Why would anyone brew tea with ice?”

The attendant shrugged. “A lot of people seem to like iced tea, but it’s good hot too. So hot roasted oolong tea. And for you, miss?”

Sayuri’s expression briefly flickered to a cringe.

*Yikes, Yuri. I know you’re passionate about tea but that kinda came off as condescending.*

Sayuri stepped up to the counter. “I’d like a hot ginger tea, please. And a bowl of the cinnamon sugar oatmeal. For here, please.”

Sayuri and Yuri paid the bill and sat down at one of the coffee shop’s tables. Shortly afterward, an attendant brought a tray with two small pots and two mugs.

Yuri gave an approving smile as she poured herself some tea. “I see that this establishment is familiar with the proper way to brew tea. The aroma is also quite nice.”

“Yeah,” Sayuri agreed, “This ginger tea smells really strong. I’m excited to try it.”

The food that they had ordered arrived and the two cousins sat together and enjoyed their meals.

“So Yuri,” Sayuri began after finishing a bite of her oatmeal, “Are you excited for shopping today?”

Yuri nodded. “Yes. While I did possess casual clothing…where we came from, I am looking forward to having more of a variety of garments to wear.”

“True, you did have the sweater and pants outfit,” Sayuri observed, “I’m so excited to get something other than this school uniform to wear. Not that I mind it…without the jacket, neck ribbon, and sweater the skirt and shirt make a cute business casual outfit. But I’m looking forward to getting sporty clothes, t-shirts, casual dresses, jeans, a cocktail dress…you know, everything a girl needs to have in her closet.”

*And somewhere along the way I’ll have to figure out what my style is. I never had a casual design in the digital world so I don’t even have anything to go from.*

“I must admit that I have given insufficient thought to the types of clothing I wish to acquire,” Yuri sighed, “But my understanding is that there is a department store connected to our building and several fashion boutiques are located throughout the underground mall, so I believe I should have an ample selection to choose from. Though I also must say I am a bit apprehensive about the whole thing.”

“I can understand that,” Sayuri agreed, “I’m a little nervous too. But hey, we’ll all learn together.”

Yuri sat back in her chair, reassured, but still looked somewhat nervous.

“Um…Sayuri, could I ask for your thoughts on something?

Sayuri smiled warmly. “Of course. We’re family, and that means I’ll always support you however I can.”

Yuri returned the smile. “Thank you. I suppose I am still adjusting to the idea of family. But my quandary concerns an idea I had for the future. Last night as we were leaving the library, I observed a vacant café space, and I thought…I thought that it might be a good opportunity for me to open a tea shop to cater to library patrons.”

“Ooh, owning your own business, huh?” Sayuri replied, intrigued, “That’s very ambitious. With your passion for tea, you’d certainly have that side of things covered. I’m sure our friends from FXI would also be willing to help you understand the business side of things. But at the same time, I know that you, like me, aren’t always great with people you don’t know. How do you feel about dealing with customers?”

Yuri looked away and played with her hair, a gesture that Sayuri had come to know meant her cousin was unsure of herself.

“I was thinking…maybe Natsuki and I could partner up and run the business together. She could run a bakery and be the public face of the shop and I could manage the tea side of things.”

Sayuri thought for a moment. “That’s not a bad idea, really. You could provide tea and baked goods, and you two have very different perspectives on things which could strengthen the business. Have you told her about your idea?”

Yuri shook her head. “No…not yet…I’m afraid she’ll think it’s a ridiculous concept.”

Sayuri looked surprised. “No…I can’t imagine her reaction would be dismissive. Baking is one of her favorite hobbies. I think she’d be excited to start a business with you. You really should talk to her about it.”

Yuri nodded. “She has mentioned a dream of travelling to France to train as a pastry chef, so perhaps you are correct. I will discuss this with Natsuki at some point soon.”

The two cousins continued their breakfast for several more minutes before they were interrupted by a familiar voice from behind them.

“Hey, mind if we join you?”

Sayuri turned to see Monika, Natsuki, and Sayori waving as they walked towards their table with drinks and pastries in hand. They were all dressed similarly to Sayuri, having decided not to wear their sweaters and blazers that morning.

“Of course,” Sayuri said, gesturing to the empty seats at their table, “Pull up a chair.”

“Everyone excited for shopping?” Sayori asked, a big grin on her face.

“More than you know,” Monika replied under her breath.

“Is MC at work again today?” Sayuri asked.

“Yeah, he’s somehow become Mister Responsible,” Natsuki said, “Never would have thought that was possible when we first met him.”

“He’s always had it in him,” Sayori said with a smile, “He just had to put his mind to it. And besides, I can guarantee that he would find a day of shopping with us really boring.”

As the group finished their breakfast, Sayuri looked around the table at her friends.

*I really wonder what everyone’s style will be like. I expect Monika to be very classy, Sayori will go for fun and bright, Natsuki could either go cute or kinda punk rock, and Yuri will probably have the most reserved style of the group. But that still doesn’t help me know what I want for myself. I guess I’ll just have to start trying on outfits and seeing what I like.*

“Okay, everyone, shall we?” Monika suggested as she stood to return her tray, plate and glass.

“Let’s do it!” Sayori agreed.

“Where first?” Natsuki asked, “I was thinking we could start with some of the boutiques down by the library. I passed a few that looked promising when I went to the bookstore.”

“Or do you just want to go back to the bookstore and talk to a certain someone again?” Sayori replied in a tone of good-natured teasing.

Natsuki’s face turned red briefly before she recovered. “I…of course not! That didn’t even occur to me. It’s not like I was looking for a date anyway.”

Sayuri smiled in amusement at Natsuki’s lackluster explanation.

*The tsundere act again. Who is she trying to convince? Us or herself? I have to at least give her credit for picking her story and sticking to it.*

“What about the department store?” Sayuri suggested, “We can get to it from the basement level and it has several floors so we could probably at least find some good basics there.”

“Good idea, Sayuri,” Monika agreed, “We can start there and move on to some of the other stores in the mall if we find that we need more. Anyone object?”

Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki shook their heads, and the group stood and walked to the elevator bay to head down to the basement levels. They caught an elevator going down and soon arrived on floor B1 and walked down a gray tiled tunnel past the entrance to the parking lot and the convenience store Monika had visited early in the morning and arrived at the entrance to the department store.

The bottom floor of the department store contained a food hall and a small supermarket. As the store had just opened, the floor was bustling with employees getting ready for the day’s customers.

“This all looks really good!” Sayori observed happily, “After we buy clothes, we can come here for lunch.”

“It would also likely be advisable for us to purchase groceries for our homes as well,” Yuri added, “The supermarket appears to have a large selection of fresh food.”

“I hope they have the ingredients I need for baking,” Natsuki said hopefully, “With how nice the kitchens are in our homes, it would be a shame to not make use of it.”

“All good ideas,” Monika agreed as the group proceeded to the escalators and the store directory, “But let’s see where we can find clothes first. Since we were kindly provided with basics like undergarments, I think we can skip right to full outfits.”

Sayuri studied the directory. “Looks like the ground floor is luxury items and jewelry, the next floor up is men’s clothing, and floors three and four are women’s clothes, sportswear is on five, and there’s more on other floors including home furnishings.”

“Alright, then let’s head up to the third floor,” Sayori said, stepping onto the up escalator, “I can’t wait to try on some cute new outfits. I hope they have hair bows too.”

Sayuri arched an eyebrow at her cousin as the group proceeded up the stairs. “Wow, Sayori, you’re going to change up your signature red hair bow?”

Sayori shrugged happily. “Maybe! At the very least I’d love to find one for nicer occasions, but who knows? Maybe I’ll find a blue one or a polka dot one. What are you hoping to find?”

Sayuri thought for a moment. “Definitely some casual outfits…maybe some jeans or denim skirts. I also want to find a cocktail dress for nicer occasions.”

“Ooh, great idea Sayuri,” Monika chimed in, “We should definitely find some dresses for nicer occasions.”

Sayuri smiled and nodded at Monika. *Is that a trace of nervousness I hear in our normally confident club president?*

The group arrived on the third floor and looked around. The floor was centered on the escalator bay, with a tile path running in a square around the floor to the various brands of clothing that were represented. The floor was relatively quiet at this morning hour, with a few other shoppers looking at items and store employees finishing the opening of their sections.

“It appears that the clothing available on this floor is more casual wear,” Yuri observed, “I would suggest that we take the next half hour to choose clothing and then meet at the fitting rooms to try on and share what we have chosen.”

The other members of the Literature Club agreed and split up to walk around the floor. Sayuri found the section dedicated to a popular denim brand and began to examine her options.

*Let’s see…here we are. Jeans and demin skirts. Jackets too…but I’m not sure a full denim outfit is my style.*

She held up a few skirts to herself before deciding on a black denim skirt that looked like it would come down to just above her knees.

“That would look good on you,” Sayori said, glancing over from the rack of jeans she was searching through, “I like the black color and the length of that skirt.”

Sayuri nodded happily. “Thanks. Definitely going to try this one on. Have you found any jeans that you like?”

Sayori selected a pair off the rack in a deep blue denim color. “I’m going to try these on. They’re supposed to be fitted without being skinny jeans.”

“Nice,” Sayuri agreed, “I may have to grab a pair of those too.”

Satisfied with their denim selections, Sayori and Sayuri proceeded to a section of the floor that featured a variety of casual clothes from tops to pants and skirts to casual dresses from a popular designer. Sayuri looked over the racks and one top immediately caught her eye.

*I’m totally getting this if it’s in my size.*

Sayuri removed a turtleneck in a deep pink color from the rack and checked the tag.

“Hey Sayori, what do you think about this one? It looks like it would fit.”

“Ooh, that’s a great color!” Sayori replied approvingly, “That would be perfect for colder months like now.”

She flipped through several tops before pulling out a mid-weight light pink shirt with mid-length sleeves. “I like this one too.”

The cousins continued into a section of casual dresses, where they found Monika looking intently at a white strapless mid-length casual dress. When she turned to greet Sayori and Sayuri, they saw that her eyes were red as if from crying.

*Why would she be crying?*

“Monika, are you alright?” Sayori asked, concerned.

Monika smiled, “Oh…don’t mind me. I was just thinking…just lost in my own thoughts.”

Sayori and Sayuri looked at each other, puzzled.

“If I may ask, Monika, are they sad thoughts?” Sayuri asked, “Your eyes are red.”

Monika looked sadly at the dress. “I’m going to go try this dress on in a few minutes. It will be the first time in my entire existence that I have worn an outfit other than my uniform.”

“Oh my goodness, Monika,” Sayori whispered, “You never had a casual outfit…before.”

“I can understand how that would be an emotional experience,” Sayuri said sympathetically.

Monika nodded. “It’s just…kind of overwhelming. And it didn’t really hit me until I actually held this garment in my hands. But I think I just need a few minutes and then I’ll be fine. I can’t wait to see what everyone else has picked out.”

Sayuri and Sayori nodded and left Monika with her thoughts as they continued to explore the floor of casual clothing. As they reviewed the various designers’ sections of the floor, they each ended up with several more items, including a pair of blue tight-fitting casual pants for Sayuri, relaxed pants and a sweatshirt for Monika, and a white casual dress with gold trim for Sayori. At the agreed time, they met in front of the fitting rooms.

“Okay, everyone,” Monika began, back to her usual controlled self, “As we try on these clothes let’s each pick our favorite outfit and show the group.”

The other members of the Literature Club agreed and went into their designated changing rooms to try on the outfits. Sayuri tried on the black jean skirt she had selected along with the pink turtleneck and looked at herself in the mirror.

*They both fit well and look good, but I don’t know that they’re perfect together.*

Her eyes fell on the tight blue pants she had chosen.

*That’s it.*

She removed the skirt and hung it back on its hanger before pulling on the pants. Satisfied with her look in the mirror, Sayuri exited the changing booth and awaited her friends. Moments later they all emerged; Monika wore the white dress she had picked out, while Yuri was dressed in a beige turtleneck sweater and black yoga pants. Sayori, like Monika had gone for a casual white dress, and Natsuki wore a pink skirt with frills and a white t-shirt with pink detailing.

“Looking good, ladies,” Monika said as she looked at the group.

Natsuki looked at Yuri. “Go on, you can say it.”

Yuri looked confused. “I’m not sure I understand.”

Natsuki sighed. “Just tell me that you think my outfit is overly cute and get it over with. I know that’s what you’re thinking.”

“Oh…,” Yuri said, “That is not what I was thinking. I was going to say that your outfit appears to be very fun and that I should go look for that skirt in my size.”

“Yeah, of course you always say that – wait, huh?” Natsuki stopped in surprise, “You like my outfit?”

Yuri nodded. “Of course. Your style very clearly reflects your personality, and I applaud that.”

“Oh,” Natsuki said, “Uh…thanks. I…um…was not expecting that. I was ready to explain to you why you were wrong. I like your outfit as well, Yuri. It looks really comfortable.”

Yuri nodded appreciatively. “Thank you. I believe Sayuri has chosen a similarly comfortable outfit as well.”

“Yeah, that’s a great color, Sayuri,” Monika said approvingly.

Sayuri smiled, “Thanks, Monika. You and Sayori look great in those dresses too.”

“Okay, everyone, Monika said, “I think we can call this floor a success. Let’s check out and head upstairs.”

The group changed back into the outfits they had worn to the store and took turns paying for the garments they had selected.

“Oh, I forgot one thing. Do you have any hair bows like this?” Sayori asked the store employee who had been helping them check out.

The store employee thought for a moment before responding dismissively. “I don’t know…I’ve honestly never seen anyone your age wearing something like that. Maybe in the children’s section?”

“Oh,” Sayori replied quietly as she unclipped her bow from her hair and put it in the pocket of her blue pleated skirt, “Okay.”

Sayuri watched her walk ahead of her friends towards the escalators that would take the group up to the next floor with her head down, looking dejected.

*That definitely was not what she needed to hear. She’s already unsure of herself and now this. Maybe finding a nice cocktail dress will cheer her up. Maybe I should say something.*

“Sayori, I-“

Sayori didn’t look up but held up a hand as she kept walking towards the escalators.

“No, Sayuri. I know what you’re going to say. You’re going to reassure me, and I really appreciate your concern, but…I’m okay. Really. Don’t worry about me. I just need a few minutes to myself, and I’ll be back to normal.”

Sayori walked up the escalator, leaving her puzzled friends behind. The group ascended to the next floor, which featured more formal clothing, in silence. When they arrived on the next floor, Sayori was nowhere to be seen among the racks of dresses and other clothing. Like the previous floor, the fifth

“Should we look for her?” Natsuki asked, “If someone had insulted my style like that, I would have told them to shut up.”

“I don’t think this is about the bow,” Monika theorized, “Sayori never likes to show negative feelings or have us worried about her, so for her to react this strongly is unusual. She might just be overwhelmed by everything that has happened, but we should keep an eye on her. I’ll try to talk to her later.”

“Are you sure?” Sayuri asked with concern, “I don’t want her to have to suffer in silence.”

“Given Sayori’s history, I believe that the best course of action is to give her space but to monitor her behavior for any further deterioration,” Yuri recommended, “Pressing her on the matter at this time may cause her to retreat further into herself.”

Sayuri nodded. “I suppose that makes sense. I just don’t want her to be sad. This is supposed to be a fun day out for all of us.”

“You’re a lot like her that way, Sayuri,” Natsuki said encouragingly, “You’re a very loyal friend. I agree with Yuri in this case…I think she just needs some space. I’m sure she’ll rejoin us when she’s ready. In the meantime, let’s go find some cute dresses.”

“We should probably find some professional outfits as well,” Monika suggested.

“So, basically, our uniforms but a different color?” Natsuki asked.

“That would be one option,” Monika agreed.

While Monika and Natsuki continued to discuss various options for professional attire, Sayuri wandered around the floor looking for a dress for nicer occasions.

*Let’s see…something cute but a bit more formal. Something that I could wear for a nice date or a cocktail party.*

She stopped to look at a long, flowing dress in an ice blue color and held it up to herself in a nearby mirror.

*Not quite it. This would probably look better on Sayori than it would on me.*

Sayuri continued to scan the racks for several minutes before pulling a purple satin cross-strap mini dress off the rack. As she held it up to herself in the mirror, she knew that she had found what she was looking for.

*This is perfect. Classy but still flirty and fun. I’m going to go try this on.*

After glancing at the price tag and confirming that the dress wasn’t unreasonably expensive, Sayuri carried it over to the floor’s fitting rooms, which featured beige walls and a beige couch where someone could sit while waiting for a room to become available. As she walked to the attendant’s desk to check in, she saw Sayori walk out of one of the fitting rooms wearing a floor-length dress in a deep red color.

“Hey, Sayuri!” Sayori said with a wave, her previous dark mood having seemingly disappeared, “I was just going to come find everyone. What do you think of this dress?”

“It looks great!” Sayuri replied approvingly, “It’s really cute and I think it suits your style really well.”

Sayori smiled “Thanks! I figured this would be fun for when we go out to parties or for date night. Oh and look at this!”

Sayori pointed to her hair, which featured a bow similar to the one she usually wore but in a red velvet fabric that was a close match to the dress that she wore.

“They have a great selection of hair accessories, and I just had to have it!”

Sayuri returned her cousin’s smile. *She seems to be her cheery self again, but her mood swing is concerning.*

“That’s great, Sayori. Now you have a fancy version of your everyday bow.”

Sayori nodded. “Exactly. I see you found a dress too. Go try it on, I’m sure you’ll look really cute in it!”

Sayuri nodded, retrieved a key to one of the fitting rooms from the attendant, and stepped into the room. She removed her shirt and skirt, pulled the dress on, and zipped it up before looking in the mirror. She grinned as she looked at her reflection.

*Wow. Looking good, Sayuri.*

She stepped out of the fitting room to show the dress Sayori, who had changed into the white and gold dress she had purchased earlier.

“How do I look?”

Sayori gave her cousin two thumbs up. “That looks super cute on you! I love that satin fabric. It almost changes color as you move in it.”

“Cool. I’m glad you approve,” Sayuri said with a grin, “That casual dress looks good on you too. And I think I’m going to change into one of my casual outfits now too.”

She returned to the fitting room and changed into her blue pants and pink turtleneck.

*This is a perfect casual outfit for a winter day like this.*

Sayori and Sayuri paid for their dresses and regrouped with Monika, Natsuki, and Yuri who had found formal outfits of their own and had also changed into casual outfits that they had purchased. Yuri had chosen a black floor-length gown, while Natsuki had chosen a short pink dress with red floral details and Monika had picked out a mid-length dress in a green satin that complimented the emerald color of her eyes.

“Okay, everyone,” Monika began as the group assembled by the escalators, “I think we can call this morning a success. We still need to find a few more things like shoes and swimwear but I think we can head into the mall for that. Where to next?”

These days, I’m not looking for anything romantic, just a good old-fashioned connection with someone who brings that calm, understanding energy girls are just unfairly good at.

I’m socially active, not socially anxious. I just run on a low battery by the time the day ends, and I’d love to have someone to text about my “you won’t believe what just happened” moments. It could be memes, voice notes or just good banter after a long day.

If you vibe with that, cool, chill, and kind, let’s talk. If by chance we’re in the same city or nearby, let’s go café hopping sometime. I’m always down for good coffee, better conversation, and maybe discovering a new regular spot. Not here to waste time or trauma-dump. Just looking to make a new friend who gets it.

Favorite trophy:
My favorite trophy is 	(´・ω・`) for being the cutest trophy name ever.

Least favorite trophy:
This is an easy one, the one for winning a video game, that mini-game made me so angry.

Favorite character:
My favorite character is Jill’s cat Fore because he is a kitty.

Least favorite character:
My least favorite character has to be Dorothy. Her personality is fine and I know it is SUPPOSED to make you uncomfortable but the fact that she is a sex worker that is meant to look like a kid is just not something I think the gam really needed.

Were there animals and could you pet them?
There is Jill’s cat Fore and a couple dogs that are customers/a worker and I think you can get dared to pet one of them at some point to maybe?

Did I enjoy the art style?
I did! I loved the cyberpunk art style and all of the characters/background. All in all it was a good game but like I said before I do think I preferred CoffeeTalk!",5,1750530641.0,Trophies,1,1.0,False

First of all let me expose my situation, sorry if its long.

I’ve always been super shy so even starting off gym was a huge step for me, while talking to a friend of mine and a few glasses of wine later and she picked up my phone and followed him on instagram because I confessed I found him cute and wondered how many women are so straightfoward (and i do feel like I miss on a lot not doing so).

Afterwards he followed back and funny thing, he started liking my stories and posts. Fast foward he is definately not my type but I found him to be “cute” and with an approachable posture. 

But going out with him I didn’t feel much of a vibe/comfort and we went straight to sex. But because I do have a toxic relationship pattern I just tought well this might feel boring for now but might be something amazing later so I kept investing on it. 

The thing is after the sex I noticed he really distanced himself. 

I brought it up to his attention and he said he felt like I wanted space and justified that with having a exam in a few days. I get that but he keeps making plans with other people and us being so close (his gym is literally near my house) I dont get why he doesnt want to see me for a cup of coffee even. 

Im starting to think I made a huge mistake sleeping with him so early on and I think this is such a common story its probably obvious (hes just not that into me) and thats fine. 

I just dont want this to be drama Im creating out of nowhere. 

Yesterday I invited him to the beach and he said he would gladly agree if he had no plans already, but didnt rearrange anything. Im feeling a really big lack of effort on his part. 

No date arranged, no dinner, no nothing. 

And I feel like I should switch gyms because its starting to be a him focused thing instead of a me. ",0,1750530130.0,dating_advice,18,0.44,False

Fast forward to 2024... i found out my little sister (35f) was pregnant!  i was excited to know i was going to be a auntie again. sadly she had a miscarriage. she got pregnant again later in the year but suffered another miscarriage. we were all heartbroken. we wanted to be there for her but she wanted space. which was understandable.

now, its a couple days before christmas 2024. i was talking with my mom and noticed two little christmas stockings hanging up. so i asked what they were for. heres how that convo went...

mom whats with the little stockings hanging there?

oh those are to represent your sisters babies she miscarried

\*i paused and said Uhhh shouldnt there be 3?

why would there be 3? she only miscarried 2.

well... what about the baby i miscarried?

SHE BLEW UP SCREAMING AT ME!!!! screaming ""OH MY FUCKIING GOD OP ITS NOT ALL ABOUT YOU BI\*\*\*\*! STOP TRYING TO BE A VICTIM!

i started to cry and yelled back ""IM SORRY YOU HATE ME SO MUCH AND ADORE ASH(fake name) BUT MY BABY MATTERS TOO!""

she then said that this isnt about me or my unborn baby. thats its all about my sister and her unborn babies and my feelings dont matter ( for context my mom has ALWAYS Favorited my little sister and older brother over me. mom actually tells me quite often how she ""wishes i threw you out that third story window as a baby because i never wanted or loved you, even now."") so i left for work crying and her telling me to suck it up and get over it.

FF to christmas... mom had already told my sister what happend. so im sitting at the table having coffee before work. when in walks my sister. she looks at my mom and says ""im not doing christmas if that b\*\*\*\* is going to be here"". i stood up and dumped my coffee in the sink, grabbed my things for work and on my out the door i looked at my sister and said ""hmmm.... merry f\*\*\*\*ing christmas mommys little favorite"" and slammed the door on my way out.

my sister an i havent talked at all.

Lois:  Carol I need a date +1 for my cousins wedding next month.  What am I going to do?

Carol: No one from upstate you could ask?

Lois: Not really. They’d get the wrong idea and no one is intending to be with.

Carol: Let’s see who in this company would be worth asking? Well no one in your department. Not ethical. Too young.
Sales department? Too married too divorced too sleepy.

Lois: Carol you do love to stereotype.

Carol: Yea makes it easier to eliminate the unworthy.
Ok Accounting?  Nah old men and young women.  
Executives?  Old but they do have money.

Lois: it’s just a date for a wedding. Must be someone my age and normal. (Sigh)

Carol:   There is one guy about your age, intelligent, decent appearance.  And you work well with him when you need to.

Lois:   Who?

Carol:   Nick from IT

Lois:   Really?  No.  Hmmm Let me think about it.

Carol:   But don’t over think it.
Back to work.

Next day Lois went into the break room first thing in the morning. Something she rarely does. But she had a need for caffeine.  Pouring a cup of coffee was Nick from IT.

Nick:  Good morning Lois.  Can I pour you a cup?

Lois nodded yes.
As Nick poured Lois said:  Nick can I ask you something?  She pointed the way to a far table.
Lois: I need to ask you something in private Nick.  But not here.  Can you meet me tomorrow after work?  But not at anyplace around here.

Nick:   Sure Lois. Text me later and we’ll figure a place to meet.  I have a meeting right now.

Lois:  that’ll work.
She let out a sigh of relief.

Nick was wondering what it was all about. But he had work to do.

Later that day Lois texted Nick:  Do you have any place we can chat away from work area?
Nick texted: You live in Hatboro and I live in Chalfont. How about Jim’s in Warminster?  Just up York rd from you.
Lois:  ok  I know where that is. 7 pm?
Nick: ok good.  I’ll meet you at the bench outside.

At 6:50 Nick sat down on the bench in front of Jim’s.  He figured it would be easier for Lois   If he was there first.
Two minutes later Lois was there.

Lois:   Nick thanks for coming.  You must be wondering what is so private not to talk at or near work.

Nick:   Lois I had several ideas what it could be.  Most were too incredible to make any sense.
But let’s get a seat and relax a second.

They were seated at a booth.  Lois ordered white wine, Nick a beer.

Nick:   Lois what would you like to eat?  They have excellent roast beef sandwiches.

Lois:   Oh nothing for me thanks.  I’m too nervous.

Nick:   Says the girl who probably only had coffee for breakfast. Eat half her sandwich for lunch. And now is drinking wine . 

Lois:   Nick have you been spying on me?  I had a bagel for breakfast and almost ate all my sandwich for lunch.  Ok? (Ok had a sarcastic tone)

Nick:  I’m going to order a few appetizers.  You can watch me eat or eat them too.
I think I’ll have loaded tater tots, stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.

Lois:   Did you say stuffed mushrooms?  Oh I love them.  Oh they have onion rings and chicken bites.  
Nick good idea! We can chat and eat comfort foods.

Nick:   I thought you may pass out on me if you didn’t eat.
So what did you want to ask me?

Lois took a sip of her wine.  Took a deep breath and said:  I have a wedding I’m invited to and I was wondering if you would be my date? 

Nick:   What happened to Jake your boyfriend?

Lois:  he hasn’t been around since before Christmas.

Nick:   Oh sorry 

Lois:   Time to move on.

Nick:   About time… to talk about the wedding.

Lois: The wedding is two weeks from Saturday.  It’s upstate and I have to be there for the rehearsal dinner on Friday.  It would be great if you could get Friday off and we can go together.  You can stay at my parents house with me and use my brothers old room.

Nick:   No problem. I have enough days owed me to get off.
But I do have a few questions.

Lois:   Ok  nothing that would make you back out?

Nick:   No just informational questions.
Are you in the wedding?

L(ois)   No she has 2 sisters and the groom has 2 sisters 

N(ick):  Father or mother side

L:    Father’s brother daughter?

N:  Another Mrs. Novak. Any other aunts uncles siblings?

L:  My father’s sister married. She’s the one who thinks she’s right all the time.
And my brother and his wife and 3 kids.

N:   Every family has one.  There is a right way a wrong way and their way. And their way is always right. You just have to work around them.

L:   Exactly 

N:  So what should I know about your dad?  What does he do? Hobbies? Sports teams? I don’t want to talk about the Phillies Eagles and he hates those teams.  

L:   He was a realtor . Retired  loves golf trains.  He likes those teams.

N:   Great plenty to talk about.  And your mom?

L:   She was a school teacher retired but still does substitute teaching.  Sewing and gardening are her hobbies.

N:   Nice! And your brother?

L:   Married with 3 kids - two girls and a boy.  They will be the ring bearer and two flower girls.  He works in finance for a NYC firm but works mainly from home.  He plays golf too.
Linda his wife is a teacher and assistant principal at an elementary school. She also sews if she has time with three kids.

N:   Ok. And the bride and her family?

L:   My but you are very inquisitive!

N:   I just want to be able have a conversation with them.  Something I can ask them about.  And you’ve given me a lot of information.

L:   My uncle has his own business and likes golf.  My aunt is an office worker and she also sews.  3 daughters one wedding now.  

N:   Thanks Lois.   I’ll have conversation starters for your family. 

L:   Nick you were right.  Appetizers were the way to go.  I’m feeling better and relaxed.

N:   Wow we made short work of them!  Let’s get some more.  Mushrooms and crab dip?

L:   And loaded tater tots please.

N:   More wine?  I’m having another beer.  Saturday tomorrow.  You can sleep late.

L:   Sure.  Anymore questions?

N:   Just a few about you.  Anything special I should know about you? Something someone would bring up ?  Any ex boyfriend from high school days who could be jealous I’m your date? 

L:   No never dated in high school.  Doubt you have to worry about anyone. 

N:   Ok   Any questions for me?

L:   Promise me you won’t tell anyone about this.  I don’t want us to be the subject of gossip at work.  That means no posts on social media.  Ok?

N:   Yes Miss Lois I understand.  Can I tell anyone not connected with work?

L:   Like who?  Some of your golfing buddies?  I prefer you hold off until at least after the wedding please.

N:   Ok I can do that.  Even if I have to be cryptic. 

L:   Thanks Nick

N:   Thanks for asking me Lois.
So who are you going to tell?  You have to tell the bride that you’re coming with a date.  
Anyone else you want to tell?

L:   The bride and my sister in law.  We tell each other everything.  Oh if you agree Carol from work.  She and I have talked about this for a few weeks.  She suggested you but she doesn’t know yet I asked you.  

N:   Ok I know Carol can keep a secret. She’s keeping secrets for me. I trust her.

L:   You and Carol have secrets?  About?

N:   No comment 

L:   Now you are being cryptic. Any hint?  Anyone I know?  

N:   Ok I think we’re done with the appetizers and drinks. Time to go before I say something more.

L:   Are you blushing?  Oh sorry.  We better go.  
Thanks Nick for agreeing to be my date. And thanks for a great night and good food.

N:   I had a great time too!

Lois returned home feeling relieved and relaxed. She immediately texted Carol.
L:   Carol are you here?
C:   I’m here.  What’s up?
L:   Are you alone?
C:   Yes. Call me.
L:  (on the phone)  Saw Nick in the break room.  “Can I ask you something in private?  But not here.  Some place away from work tomorrow night after work.”  We met at Jim’s in Warminster. 
He insisted I have some food with my wine.  I must have looked anxious.
C:   Yes when you’re anxious overwhelmed and little food you almost look like you’re going to pass out.
L:   Does everyone know about this?
C:   Only the ones who care about you.
L:   He picked 4 good appetizers and I added 1.
I took a deep breath and a big sip of wine.  I told him I had a wedding to go to and would he be my date.  He smiled and then looked puzzled. What happened to Jake?  Told him. He said he’d be happy to be my date.  I gave him the details etc.   He had a ton of questions.  Said he wanted to know about my family so he could have conversations with them.  I never thought he wanted to be proactive.
C:   Nick really is a great guy.
L:   Then I told him he couldn’t tell anyone.  No one at work, none of his friends.  I even said not his parents until after the wedding .
I said I have to tell my family brides family and my brother and sister in law.  And if it’s okay with him I want to tell you Carol. It was ok with him because you kept some secrets for him.  Ok Carol what secrets?  
C:   I can’t tell you without Nick’s permission.
L:   Is it about me?
C:   No comment 
L:   Nick said that too.  
C:   So did it go well?  Will you be able to make it work?
L:   Better than I thought.  I think I’m going to have a good time.

Monday before the wedding Lois texts Nick
L:   Mr I’m in the mood for some stuffed mushrooms.  Are you interested?
N:   Absolutely! Jim’s about 6:30?
L:   Yes that works for me.
N:   I’ll meet you at the bench.
L:   Why not inside?
N:   Because a guy likes to walk into a place with a pretty girl by his side.
L:   So you think I’m pretty?
N:   Lois stop trying to make me blush and get back to work. I’ll see you at 6:30

At 6:30 Nick saw Lois sitting on the bench.
Lois stands up twirlers around and says teasingly 
L:   Hi Nick. Am I pretty enough for you today? 
N:   Every day Lois!
That surprised her. She thought he’d laugh it  off.

L:   I can’t stay long.  Want to get my work cleared up before I or we go to the wedding.
N:   Yes me too!
L:   Update on the wedding.  I told my cousin I was bringing a date. Not Jake the snake she said?  I told her I was bringing the guy I was dancing with at the Christmas party.
N:   You told her about that? I almost punched Jake that night.
Who else did you tell?
L:   Just Linda my sister in law. The three of us are pretty close.  I had to tell someone. Who did you tell?
N:   Carol and your boss calmed me down . Mr. Logan said I should have decked him but thanked me for being calm.
L:   Oh I need to know what you want to eat at the wedding.  Beef salmon pasta vegan.
N:   What are you having?
L:   Beef I don’t like salmon.
N:   Then I’ll have the salmon.  But we have to exchange bites.  Ok?
L:   Do I have to?
N:   Yes you do. lol 
What time do you want to leave Friday?
L:   7 ok ?  Mom will have a late breakfast for us and we have shopping to do. So you’re going to be alone with my dad.
N:   Now you know why I asked so many questions. We have a few things we can chat about.
L:   He’ll probably ask about you.
N:   I’ll assure your dad my intentions are purely honorable when it comes to Lois.
L:   That’s funny.  Luv to see that conversation.
N:   Here’s to a fun weekend.

At 7 am Nick knocks on Lois’s door 
L:   Come on in Nick
N:   Good morning Lois. You all set? Got everything?  Just two bags and garment bag?
L:    Let’s get going. I’m anxious to get there.
N:   Stop for coffee?
L:    You read my mind. Wawa coffee please.
N:    Good because I don’t do Starbucks. Too expensive.
 Loaded up with two 24oz coffees and a breakfast burrito each.
N:   Ok what town to I put in the GPS?
L:    Wyoming 
N:   The state?
L:   No it’s a town in Pa 
N:   Ok got it.  Radio? Music?
L:   Sure but just in the background.  
N:   Isn’t nice not to have to get dressed up first thing? You dress down nice.
L:   No one ever said I’m a good dress downer.
N:   Yes we always see each other in business attire. 
L:   But more formal attire tonight and tomorrow.  Can’t wait to see everyone.
N:   So tell me Miss Lois what secret thing does Lois do that would surprise people?
L:   Ok Mr Nick. But you have to go first.
N:   Oh you turned the tables on me.  Well I watch YouTube videos about the rich billionaire who bumps into a waitress or hires a new woman employee.  He falls in love with them because they don’t want anything from him. He stalks her until she agrees to go to a formal dinner with him. He buys her gown shoes etc.  come on we know he’s just trying to get into her pants.
L:   Nick is that what you’re trying to do to me? Get into my pants?
N:   What?!  Why are you always teasing me and making me blush?
L:   Because it’s so easy to tease you. Besides you blush a nice shade of red!
N:   Ugh you’re exasperating .
But these are YouTube videos so it’s strictly pg13.  Eventually he proposes with an a ring in a velvet box. Every story has the box. All the rings are elegant but simple. Yea right! Guy with billions goes for a cheap ring. Always no big weddings and most stories the guy quits his job to run a coffee shop. Nice to have a golden parachute to retire on.  Never has any kids.
Why can’t they be normal people trying to find real love get married have kids and try to live life as best they can? 
But I keep watching them hoping something will be different.
L:   Interesting.  Never know what you get on
YouTube.
My thing is I like to watch old black and white movies.  Love Fred Astir and Ginger Roger movies. Thin Man series is great. And a lot more. I usually watch them by myself.
N:   Interesting choice of movies.
Oh time to get off the turnpike.  Wyoming Pa we’re almost there.

I’m 28, based in the UK, and no, I don’t actually go around saying, 'right, what’s all this then?' If that joke or meme is a mystery to you, feel free to ignore my nonsense lol. It’d be lovely to find something that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



I’m a massive fiction nerd. After work, all I want is to disappear into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I’ll get back into reading history, but so far it’s mostly just Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. Definitely better than abandoning it altogether, even if uni tried its best to crush my soul with an enormous reading list I never followed. This is me, master of excuses and self-justifications. 😀 If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m overly caffeinated, (cough cough,) I am, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. For me, amazing conversations are when we forget about time, doesn't matter whether it's serious or lighthearted, the next thing we know, it's been hours. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully sparks fly.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.



If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start already. 😀
