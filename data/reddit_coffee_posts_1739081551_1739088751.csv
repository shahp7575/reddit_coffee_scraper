What makes this series so great it's the way it it allows me to see the complexities of sexual and emotional intimacy from different perspectives. For boadening my understanding on the emotional aspect of sexual intimacy. For making me ponder on how our view on sexual intimacy might not perfectly align with that of our significant other, and this doesn't mean that we should ignore it because it will definitely backfire on us sooner or later. Communication it's the key, and if that isn't working, then maybe it's time to let go. Sex is a big part of life. Even if it's not an important for some of us, it might not be the same for our significant other.

Some people like to feel a genuine connection towards the person they are with. And nothing else would be able to make them feel it more acutely  than the feeling of feeling wanted,  of being wanted, of being seen in their entirety- while having sex.

It's clear as a day that what the characters wanted by having sex in the last ep goes beyond the physical act in itself.

Sei and Hagiwara got to each other because they want connection, which they have been building with a kind of brutal honesty all this time. And i prefer BLs that prioritize emotional connection within the narrative.ü•∫ü•πü•∞ü•∞
  
I wouldn't say the series condones or justifies cheating, but rather portraying morally grey characters. Cheating is wrong, and nothing can excuse it. However, while this drama does involve cheating as a part of the plot, what I think it does well is portraying morally grey characters who have flaws and internal conflicts as human beings. Hagiwara would be wrong for cheating on his girlfriend by sleeping with Sei while he is  still together with Kaori. Ideally, he should break up with her first, that would be the best scenario. However, I can't get myself to hate him, because, at the end of the day, he‚Äôs just a desperate man longing to be loved by the person he loves.  Same with Sei.

 As much as i am not a fan of cheating storylines myself, i can see why this was a necessary impetus to get both characters to reevaluate if they can settle with their current situations.

I am both amused and looking fondly over Kazuaki not putting almost any resistance towards his newfound feelings and predicament that his sexual escapade with Sei has on him. While i was pleasantly surprised, the revelation didn't blowed me away, because Hagiwara was always the one that recognised the changes in his feelings and his relationships with others the fastest and we could already feel for a while that he has enough of repressing his real feelings in consideration of others üòî.
Sei being the one that would resist ditching his relationship with Fujisawa in the face of pursuing a serious relationsip with Hagiwara   makes perfectly sense being what we know of him. Sei is trauma bonded and deeply codependent of Fujisawa. It makes sense that he would be slower to see the light since he never had a healthy relationship with Fujisawa in the first place. This gives his  reactions to Hagiwara's affectionate words and gestures this heartbreaking and aching feel....ü•∫ü•πüòÆ‚Äçüí®

The words that Sei says here has me by my throat.

"" What now?"" 
"" What should we do now""

What he should do now that he knows that something better is out there?

What does  he does know that he had sex with a man that has a girldfriend that he wants to marry?

What does he does now with all those newfound and ovetflowing feelings?

The plan was to keep this a secret and not destroy their lives. The plan was to have sex and move on.Sei is begging for an answer to what they should do know, an answer  that he already knows the answer of but he doesn't dare to believe, to say it out loud.

When Hagiwara yells at him that 

""Don't you understand how i feel at all?"" 
"" I am alone in thinking those things?""

Sei doesn't say anything because he feels it too, but he stubbornly doesn't want to entertain the possibility that this thing that he started with Hagiwara will go beyond the physical. Sei has always felt a bit of disconnected when it comes to understanding his feelings and allowing himself to build genuine connections to others. It's obvious that from the beginning, his intention was to get this thing done and get  out. Somehow he thought that after it, he would be fine, he could just carry on with his life as it has been so far. All he had with Hagiwara was something that was absent in his relationship with Fujisawa. All of a sudden, Hagiwara is bringing emotions  into this, thay goes beyond yhe physical and Sei feels lost.

The biggest reason why things hasn't gone the way they planned it is that both of them weren't looking only for sex, but also connection and validation. More than it's about the act itself, it's about validation. Of being able to show all about themselves to someone else and feel accepted. For the first time, their desire not being meet with rejection or perceived disgust.

Because both of them have been desperate   to feel anything, to feel connected to someone else through any means, to be reminded that they are both more than what they're failing relationships has made them into, more than the people shaped by loneliness and desperation.

They've said that they wouldn't destroy anything, wouldn't change the status quo, wouldn't change the world they suffer because they are they are suffering from their own choices.

""Just thinking of the person
who doesn't want this body is really taking it for granted."" 
""You're not bad or dirty"" 

All i can say is that i get why Hagiwara has fallen so badly for Sei. I think those words will stay with me for a long, long time.

They didn't intend to fall in love when they started messaging or meeting. Cheating is wrong not matter what. But i can't for the life of me blame them or judge them for doing this to their partners.

Both Fujisawa and Kaori has long cheated Sei and Hagiwara of the chances to find better patners by giving them false hope that tomorrow might get better.

It's too late for everyone involved now. Too late for Kaori and Fujisawa to fix the already damaged bond that they have with Hagiwara and Sei. And too late to turn things back to how they were in Sei and Hagiwara's case, because their recent secret encounter has open the floodgates and they can't fight against the marks that that encounter has left on them üòÑüòÅüòè

I am back you guys. I kind of missing this, but taking a step back from doing this did wonders to me. From time to time, i find myself feeling the need to take a step back from everything BL for a few days, because it gets too overwhelming for me. Taking a step back is the only thing that helps me get out of it. It kinds of similar to BL SLUMP, but not exactly the same üòç

My LO is 6 months and was diagnosed with CMPA at 4 months after a failed reintroduction. His gut improved, but his eczema continued to be bad and his reflux intense so he‚Äôs on omeprazole.

We‚Äôve just started introducing solids following the plan on BLW Meals. 
Starting eggs today, next allergen up is wheat, then supposedly oats. 

Our GP hasn‚Äôt been very helpful and when we got referred to the dietician we were just invited to an online seminar about milk-free weaning but given no appointment to discuss anything tailored. 

We recently took a trip to Japan for 3 weeks where I no longer ate my daily oat porridge and couldn‚Äôt really get oat milk coffees. During that trip, LO‚Äôs eczema MASSIVELY improved. It almost cleared up entirely. We also tested an oat-based moisturiser the paediatrician had recommended and he had a reaction so we cut that immediately. 
Whilst away I also accidentally ate cheese and LO had zero reaction. 

Since getting home and going back to my usual breakfast, his eczema has started to gradually worsen and I‚Äôm now wondering if he has an oat allergy, not dairy. Is it possible to have just oats and not dairy? Could we have been looking at the wrong thing all this time?

Now for weaning I‚Äôm really confused - do we offer him oats directly? Should I cut from my diet now? I was going to test dairy through my breastmilk instead of offering it direct when the schedule suggested, but I‚Äôm now confused about whether to offer oats at all or not. I‚Äôm really scared of him having a bad reaction. 

Contacting the Dr feels pointless unless we have a confirmed reaction, as they just have so little resources (NHS funding üòû). ",1,1739088392.0,MSPI,0,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the right pair of leggings can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack, especially for those with a big butt. The perfect leggings should not only fit well but also highlight your curves in a flattering way. Here are some key features to consider when shopping for leggings that cater to your unique shape.

### 1. Fabric Matters

The fabric of your leggings plays a crucial role in how they fit and feel. Look for materials that provide both stretch and support. Here are some great fabric options:

- **Spandex or Lycra:** These fabrics offer excellent elasticity and can comfortably hug your curves.
- **Nylon:** A lightweight option that‚Äôs durable and moisture-wicking, ideal for workouts.
- **Cotton blends:** These tend to be softer and more breathable but ensure they have enough stretch.

### 2. Waistband Width

The width of the waistband can significantly affect how leggings fit around your waist and hips. A wider waistband often provides more support, leading to a smoother silhouette. Additionally, consider these features:

- **High-rise styles:** These can help to elongate your torso and create a flattering look.
- **Elastic bands:** Ensure they are not too tight, as this can cause digging into your skin.

### 3. Length and Cut

When it comes to length, leggings come in various styles. Here are some common cuts:

- **Full-length:** These provide full coverage and are great for all seasons.
- **7/8 length:** This style ends just above the ankle, making it a chic option.
- **Capri styles:** These hit mid-calf and can be comfortable during warmer months.

Choosing the right length can proportionally balance the look of your legs, complementing your figure.

### 4. Design and Patterns

The style of the leggings can affect not only how they look but also how they fit around a bigger bottom. Here are some considerations:

- **Dark colors:** Opt for darker colors as they are slimming and versatile.
- **Printed designs:** Patterns can add fun but be cautious, as they may emphasize areas you want to minimize.
- **Strategic seams and panels:** Look for leggings with flattering seams that enhance your curves.

### 5. Size and Fit

Getting the right size is key to a great fit. Many brands have varying size charts, so don‚Äôt hesitate to take your measurements. Here are tips to ensure a proper fit:

- **Try before you buy:** If possible, always try them on. Move around to see how they fit when you walk, bend, or squat.
- **Check for transparency:** Bend over or squat to ensure the fabric is not see-through, which is particularly important for those with curves.
- **Tightness vs. comfort:** Leggings should fit snugly but not so tight that they restrict movement or cause discomfort.

### 6. Brand Reputation

Don't underestimate the importance of reviews and brand reputation. Companies that specialize in athletic or activewear typically understand the needs of a diverse body type. Here are some brands known for creating flattering leggings:

- **Lululemon:** Renowned for quality and style, offering great options for curvier body shapes.
- **Gymshark:** Provides trendy styles that cater to a variety of sizes.
- **Fabletics:** Known for their inclusive sizing and stylish selections.

### 7. Price Point

Finding reasonably priced leggings that are also high-quality can be tricky. Consider investing in a good pair that will last longer rather than opting for cheaper, lower-quality options. Remember, durable leggings save you money in the long run.

Styling Tips: How to Enhance Your Look with the Right Leggings
--------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the perfect leggings can truly enhance your overall look, especially when you know how to style them sensibly. Whether you‚Äôre heading to the gym, running errands, or meeting friends for coffee, the right pair of leggings can elevate your style while ensuring comfort. Here are some effective tips to make sure you choose and style leggings wisely to accentuate your shape, particularly if you want to embrace a curvy figure.

### Choose the Right Fit

The first step in styling leggings is understanding fit. Leggings should hug your body without feeling constricting. Consider trying different styles:

- **High-Waisted Leggings:** These sit at or above your natural waistline, providing support and creating a flattering silhouette.
- **Mid-Rise Leggings:** These come down to your waist and offer a good balance, perfect for casual outings.
- **Compression Leggings:** For active wear, look for compression leggings that support your muscles and enhance your shape.

When trying on leggings, check for any pulling or gaping. Ensure they fit snugly but allow for comfortable movement.

### Consider the Fabric

The fabric of your leggings plays a crucial role in how they look and feel. Look for materials with enough stretch to accommodate your curves without losing shape. Here are some popular fabric options:

Check the Details here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/41M2bh4  
  
- **Spandex or Lycra:** These materials provide excellent flexibility and fit, ideal for both everyday wear and workouts.
- **Cotton Blend:** Offers comfort and breathability, perfect for lounging or casual outings.
- **Nylon:** Known for durability, this fabric‚Äôs smooth finish can help create a streamlined appearance.

Always check how the fabric feels against your skin. If the material is too sheer, it might not provide the coverage you want.

### Play with Colors and Patterns

Leggings come in a wide array of colors and patterns. This is where you can express your personality and elevate your look. Here‚Äôs how to make your choice stand out:

- **Solid Colors:** Opt for classic colors like black, navy, or grey for versatility. These can be paired with various tops effortlessly.
- **Bold Colors:** Bright colors can make a statement. Consider vibrant tones like red or emerald that can energize your outfit.
- **Patterns:** Stripes, florals, or geometric designs can add flair. Just ensure they align harmoniously with your overall look.

### Pair with the Right Tops

Choosing the right top to wear with your leggings is essential to balance your overall appearance. Here are some suggestions:

- **Tunic Tops:** Longer tops can help elongate your silhouette and accentuate your curves.
- **Oversized Sweaters:** These complement leggings beautifully, providing a cozy yet chic vibe.
- **Fitted Tanks:** A fitted tank can showcase your waist, especially when paired with high-waisted leggings.

### Add Layers for Style

Layers enhance your outfit while adding depth. A stylish jacket or cardigan can pull your look together. Consider these layering pieces:

Check the Details here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/41M2bh4  
  
- **Denim Jacket:** This timeless staple adds a casual yet fashionable touch.
- **Utility Jacket:** Perfect for an edgy look while keeping you comfortable.

Look for materials that offer breathability and moisture-wicking to keep you active throughout the day, and don‚Äôt shy away from high-waisted options that provide added coverage and a flattering silhouette.

Additionally, styling your leggings can truly elevate your entire look. Pairing them with longer tunics or oversized sweaters can create a balanced appearance, drawing attention to your curves in a stylish way. Accessorizing with the right shoes and outerwear can further enhance your outfit, making it appropriate for various occasions, from a workout session to a casual outing with friends.

Ultimately, the key is to embrace your curves and choose leggings that make you feel confident and comfortable.

Their moment at 6th and Alder has now evolved into an unfolding mystery, intertwining their pasts and drawing them toward an inevitable discovery. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to explore any specifics or read more!

### Fragments of Lives

The clock in the corner of the dusty room had stopped ticking long ago, its hands frozen at 3:17, a forgotten relic of a moment no one remembered. Dust motes danced lazily in the narrow beams of morning light that seeped through the cracked blinds, casting fragile patterns on the faded rug below. The room held whispers of conversations past, laughter now distant echoes, and the invisible fingerprints of lives once vivid but now blurred by time.

Elias sat in the old leather chair, its seams frayed and tired, much like the man himself. His fingers traced the faint grooves carved into the wooden armrest‚Äîtiny notches marking years or perhaps days, no one knew for certain. The leather smelled faintly of old tobacco and forgotten winters, carrying a hint of something metallic, like the taste of unspoken words. His gaze drifted, not to the present, but to fragments stitched unevenly across his mind‚Äîfaces half-remembered, voices that slipped through the cracks of memory like water through cupped hands. He remembered a Tuesday afternoon, sharp and clear against the haze, when he chose silence over truth, and how that single decision became the fragile thread unraveling the fabric of something he once called home.

Across town, in an apartment that smelled faintly of rain-soaked concrete and stale coffee, Mara stared at the ceiling, counting the silent beats between her heart's reluctant thuds. She wondered how a single decision, made hastily on a Tuesday afternoon, could ripple outward, tugging at the threads of a life she barely recognized anymore. Her regrets were etched into the spaces she never filled‚Äîa call she never made, a door she never knocked on, a photograph she never looked at twice until it was too late. Forgotten birthdays, unspoken apologies, fleeting moments that felt insignificant then but now loomed like towering monuments in the landscape of her regrets.

Their stories were threads in the same tapestry, though neither knew of the other‚Äôs existence. Yet, their lives intersected in invisible ways‚Äîa glance exchanged in a crowded street, brief yet magnetic, lingering longer than it should have in the mind of a stranger. Was it recognition? A flicker of familiarity in unfamiliar eyes? Or perhaps the echo of a life unlived, a parallel path glimpsed only for a heartbeat. That stranger carried more than just anonymity; woven into their presence was the quiet hum of danger, not in the obvious sense, but the kind that shifts the trajectory of lives without notice‚Äîthe danger of what might have been or what could still be.

As the days unfolded, the forgotten details of their pasts would surface, stitched together through the perspectives of those they'd touched, knowingly or not. Each chapter, a window into a moment that seemed small until the weight of memory gave it shape and meaning.

This is where it begins‚Äînot with a grand event or a heroic act, but with the quiet spaces in between, the forgotten minutes that make up a life.

---

Mara stepped outside that morning, the chill biting through her thin sweater, but she didn‚Äôt notice. The streets were damp, reflecting fractured images of hurried strangers and dim city lights. She paused at the corner of 6th and Alder, her fingers brushing against the edge of a crumpled note in her pocket‚Äîa list of groceries she wouldn't buy. Her eyes lifted just as Elias passed by, his face shadowed beneath the brim of an old cap, his steps heavy with unspoken thoughts. Their eyes met for a second too long, a silent recognition wrapped in the familiarity of strangers. A heartbeat passed, and then they moved on, leaving the street unchanged but somehow altered.

Elias felt the echo of that glance long after he'd turned the corner. It stirred something dormant, a ripple across the still waters of his memory. He couldn't place it, but it felt like remembering a dream you never had. He tightened his grip on the small, tattered journal in his hand, its pages filled with scribbled fragments he could barely read anymore. Notes to himself, or perhaps to someone else‚Äîit didn't matter now.

Mara kept walking, her mind replaying the brief encounter. It wasn‚Äôt the face that lingered but the feeling‚Äîa pull, like gravity, soft yet undeniable. She found herself glancing back once, expecting nothing, but hoping for something. The street was empty.

But that glance was enough.

Enough to awaken the stories hidden beneath layers of forgotten minutes, waiting to be remembered.

The next morning, Mara found herself back at 6th and Alder. She wasn‚Äôt sure why she had come. Maybe it was the note, or maybe it was the restless pull of something unfinished. She leaned against the rusted street sign, watching people drift past, their faces blurring into anonymity.

Then, she saw him. Elias. Standing across the street, his journal clutched tightly in his hands, scanning the crowd as if searching for something he had lost.

Their eyes met again.

This time, neither of them looked away.

Mara took a step forward, the hesitation barely visible in the way she adjusted the strap of her bag. Elias mirrored her, shifting his weight, lifting his chin. The city hummed around them, indifferent to the gravity of the moment.

Then, as if carried by an unseen thread, they moved toward each other.

When they stood mere feet apart, words seemed like an intrusion, so neither spoke. Elias glanced down at the journal in his hands, then back up at Mara, as if weighing whether to say something or let the silence do the work for him.

Finally, she broke it. ""Do I know you?""

Elias hesitated. ""I don‚Äôt know. Maybe.""

Mara searched his face, feeling that same pull she couldn‚Äôt name. ""Did you write something once? A note, maybe?""

Elias‚Äôs fingers tightened around the journal. He exhaled, steadying himself. ""I think‚Ä¶ I think I was supposed to meet someone here. A long time ago.""

Mara reached into her pocket, pulling out the crumpled grocery list. She turned it over, revealing the faded imprint of the words she had discovered the night before: *Find what you‚Äôre not looking for.*

She held it up between them. ""Is this yours?""

Elias stared at the paper as if it were a ghost. His pulse quickened. ""I don‚Äôt know. But I think I‚Äôve been looking for it.""

A bus rumbled past, breaking the moment, but the connection had already formed. The city moved on around them, but for Elias and Mara, time had bent slightly, folding them into something neither of them yet understood.

And somewhere in the margins of an old, tattered journal, a story that had once been lost was beginning to be rewritten.

Got to know about quite useful tips and tricks for brewing coffee and many of the things that I have learnt here are sort of TIL moments for me.

So today while sipping my hot brewed dhak blend on this fine Sunday afternoon I decided to share a curated Cold Brew guide, it's not original, it's something that I have learned here and I thought to articulate all that knowledge into this guide post. Of course, it's not set in stone, there could be some improvements or changes, and as always feedback is most welcome.

I mostly use Blue Tokai for my regular as well as my cold brews, you folks can use whichever suits you best. For this guide, I am using Blue Tokai Viena Roast French Press coarse grounds as that's my main equipment as of now to brew my regular coffee. I have also experimented with their Dhak Blend version, which also turns out well in Cold Brew. 

Here, I am brewing around 800ml of Cold Brew, you can adjust the figures according to your requirements. In terms of equipment, I am using a glass jar and to enclose it I wrapped a breathable cotton cloth with a rubber band.

Option 1: **For Light Roasts** (Using the Bloom Method)

1. Coffee-to-Water Ratio:
   * use a 1:10 ratio (by weight) so for 800‚ÄØml total water, use 80‚ÄØg of coffee.
2. Bloom Phase:
   * Use hot water at about 80‚Äì90¬∞C.
   * Measure out 1.5 times the coffee weight in water for blooming: 
      * For 80‚ÄØg of coffee, that‚Äôs 120‚ÄØml of hot water.
   * Pour the 120‚ÄØml hot water over the coarse grounds and let them bloom for about 30 seconds.
3. Adding the Remaining Water:
   * After blooming, add enough cold water to bring the total water volume to 800‚ÄØml.
   * That means adding 680‚ÄØml of cold water (since 800‚ÄØml¬†‚Äì¬†120‚ÄØml = 680‚ÄØml).
4. Brew Time:
   * Stir briefly after adding all the water, then cover and let the mixture brew in the refrigerator for 16 hours.
   * Stir once more before pressing (if using a French press) or straining.

Option 2: **For Medium-to-Dark Roasts** (No Bloom Required)

1. Coffee-to-Water Ratio:
   * Again using a 1:10 ratio, use 80‚ÄØg of coffee with 800‚ÄØml of cold water.
2. Brewing Instructions:
   * Place the coffee grounds in your French press or brewing container.
   * Add 800‚ÄØml of cold water over the grounds.
   * Stir thoroughly (about 10‚Äì15 stirs) to ensure even saturation.
3. Brew Time:
   * Cover and let the brew sit in the refrigerator for 16 hours.
   * Give it another stir before plunging or straining.

**Additional Tips**

* **Adjusting Strength**
   * The method mentions a ratio range of 1:8 to 1:10. If you prefer a stronger concentrate, you could opt for a 1:8 ratio. For 800‚ÄØml water, that would mean using 100‚ÄØg of coffee. 
   * For light roasts using the bloom method, the bloom water would then be about 150‚ÄØml (1.5√ó100‚ÄØg) followed by 650‚ÄØml of cold water.
* **Experimentation** 
   * Feel free to adjust the brew time or the ratio within that range based on your taste preference, Personally, I prefer 22 hours of cold brewing time.



**Bonus Cocktails Tips**

After some experiments and balancing the taste of cold brew coffee, I have also delved into Coffee Cocktails, especially with Gin&Tonic as that's my favourite go-to drink. I have experimented with quite a few Tonic Waters as well, so that's also a good starting point. 

Alrighty, so in my opinion this should be a good rough ratio for a G&T Cold Coffee cocktail:

* 50‚ÄØml gin 
* 30‚ÄØml cold brew coffee 
* 100‚ÄØml tonic water

This 1‚ÄØ:‚ÄØ0.6‚ÄØ:‚ÄØ2 ratio lets the gin‚Äôs botanical character and the coffee‚Äôs rich, smooth bitterness play nicely against the sparkling, slightly bitter tonic. 

Suggested method:

* **Build the Cocktail:** In a chilled glass filled with ice, pour 50‚ÄØml of your preferred gin.
* **Top with Tonic Water:** Top with 100‚ÄØml of tonic water.
* **Add the Cold Brew:** Gently add 30‚ÄØml of cold brew coffee, preferrable pour it over the back side of a spoon, to create separated crystal clear effect, trust me you gonna love that. 
* **Garnish (Optional):** A twist of lemon or an orange peel can add a bright citrus note that complements both the gin and the coffee.

I understand that cocktails can be very personal and the coffee‚Äôs intensity can vary based on roast and brew method, feel free to tweak these amounts, maybe use 30ml of Gin, 100ml Tonic and 50ml Coffee, as perhaps slightly increasing the cold brew if you want a stronger coffee note, or adjusting the tonic for more refreshing fizz.

This ratio should provide a balanced cocktail where no single element overpowers the others, resulting in an innovative twist on two classic drinks. Enjoy experimenting and refining the mix to best suit your taste!

That's about it! please feel free to provide feedback, as I'm always looking for ways to improve. I love experimenting with my coffee, especially cold brews. My next experiment will be preparing a Vietnamese drip-style coffee, which I plan to try next weekend. Also, please excuse my English, it's not perfect, so I've mainly used Grammarly to help articulate my thoughts in this post.

It starts when she introduces him to a film and he assumes she is just gauging his reaction. But she does it for everything.

George gets a new mailwoman and finds her very attractive. He orders samplers of fancy and cool magazines to try and prove to her he is a hip suave kind of guy. (He doesn't cancel his Cracked subscription though because if she doesn't respect that he doesn't want anything to do with her)

Kramer takes all George's old magazines when he's done with them. He cuts out various letters and writes notes to businesses that wronged him to leave anonymous feedback. The city goes into a panic as businesses fear some sort of attack is imminent. 

Elaine is asked to be a groomsmen for a male friends wedding. He specifically tells her she's not a bridesmaid and he sees her as one of the guys. Shes never been attracted to him but feels insulted that he doesn't view her as a woman first and foremost and is determined to change that. 

Elaine finally does get him to see her as a woman by outright seducing him and getting him to admit he's attracted to her. Then she triumphantly leaves...and the wedding is abruptly cancelled as her friend is now pursuing HER romantically.

The mail woman recognizes the fonts and letters from the notes published in the newspaper and suspects George is doing it. He is brought in for questioning and his complaints about the police station coffee, lack of lumbar support in the interrogation chair, etc make him a prime suspect

1il956e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CANZUK/comments/1il956e/argument_for_single_currency/,Argument for single currency,"**Exchange rates**

Last month I solo travelled to London. First time I'd been to the U.K. since 2007. Back then I was much younger and went with my father who booked the trip and managed most of the finances.

When I booked this trip for myself, I didn't take into account the exchange rate for CAD - GBP.

Because of the weakness of the Canadian dollar it makes travelling to the U.K. a very expensive affair. In preparation for my trip, I went to my local bank to place an order for ¬£100 cash. They told me it would cost $180 (CAD). I was shocked because up until that moment I didn't realise that the GBP is actually stronger than both the Euro and USD.

It also doesn't help that most businesses in the London area prefer their customers pay by card instead of cash. Since I'm paying with a foreign credit card I have to add a 3% foreign transaction fee on every purchase I make with my card. I offered to pay with cash but a lot of traders/ cashiers seemed to get annoyed. They felt that I would be holding up the line. This was the case when ever I was purchasing a coffee at either Costas or Pret.

The trip ended up costing a little more than I anticipated. I originally planned on a second trip to the U.K. later this year, but I might have to put it on hold until next year since the exchange rate for Canadian dollars is so bad.

The situation is even worst for Australians and New Zealanders.

09/02/2025  
1 GBP = 1.77 CAD  
1 GBP = 1.98 AUD  
1 GBP = 2.19 NZD

Poor New Zealanders have to shell out over $2 just for ¬£1.

My point is, I don't think CANZUK can achieve true free movement of people if we have 4 different currencies. Having to exchange currencies will hinder people from travelling between the countries.",3,1739084821.0,CANZUK,8,0.67,False

1il91zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1il91zt/aita_for_my_tech_support_attempts/,AITA for my tech support attempts?,"It's long, im sorry. I have added headings and a tl;dr.


*BACKGROUND:*

I've had a long day which included getting locked out of my car and having to call people to break into it. Before that I was doing intense exercise. So I'm a little tired and worn out.

Once back in my car, headed to a Cafe to catch up on studying have a coffee and relax a bit. Just as I get there I see a close relative text that they need computer help. I used to work in IT Support so I'm that person in my family. Told them I'd be home in an hour and they can bring their laptop around and I will help but I really need to do my own study today.

I get home and nothing from them. Call them and they say they'll be about 15-20 minutes. I ask them to confirm because last time they kept me waiting an hour. They're late often and I've run out of patience with it.

15 minutes comes and goes. Then 20. Then 30. After its been a couple minutes past half an hour I send them a text expressing my annoyance. They never saw the text because they were buzzing me at my place as I sent it. They came in I explained they'd kept me waiting too long and not to do it again. They said a bunch of excuses and I said all I need you to do is be honest about when you'll be here, because I can't get into my studies when I know you'll show up at any random time. They tried to defend themselves and I said nothing matters, just in future tell me when you will be here and I will wait til 10 minutes after that. Then i will leave myself.

Anyway. They have a bunch of questions that don't make much sense. They are used to Windows and are now using Linux. I try my best but my problem is they are not making sense.


*TECH TROUBLESHOOTING:*

Here are two examples of how the discussion went:

- R: How do I download this file? 
- Me: you just did. Here's where it has saved, in the Downloads folder.

- R: how do I minimise a tab? 
- Me: do you mean windows? Because you can't minimise a tab 
- R: yeah, and window 
- Me: *explains* R: so what about the tabs? 
- Me: what about them? 
- R: *rolls eyes or huffs like they're exasperated* How do I move them? 
- Me: you mean the windows? 
- R: no. I mean yes. I mean.. okay answer my next question then.

... I will admit I go into serious mode when doing tech support. It was my job for years. I go into Work Mode. But I was never rude to people. I'll also admit I may have been frowning or furrowing my brow while listening and showing them stuff. Because I'm thinking hard of a) what they're really asking, b) how to do it and show them so they understand and remember and c) how to explain it while doing it and showing them all the options.


*ESCALATION:*

The final straw for R was asking how to save a downloaded file and then move it to another folder because its so different to Windows. I asked what part they meant was a problem, because it's exactly the same process in both operating systems - Linux (Fedora) and Windows. I had a puzzled/thinking look on my face as I asked. I did it on their Linux machine in front of them. They didn't understand how to move the file from Downloads to X Folder under Documents.  I showed them 3 different ways. Asked them to do it in front of me. They opened Downloads and exclaimed that their folder wasn't showing. My best recollection is I said 'yeah. That's because you're in Downloads' and went to point to the side bar that lists where they were.

I was confused at this point because they've used windows for 20+ years and do light (restart computer/clear cache) support for their company's own customer's. They are not a useless computer user but they have an extreme lack of confidence and anxiety around getting things wrong.

*THE ARGUMENT:*

I asked them again what they think is missing or different from doing it in Windows. They repeated that X folder isn't showing up when they go to open Downloads and move file to X folder. We repeated the same discussion. They absolutely lost it. Nearly hit me with their mouse as they grabbed their laptop from in front of me started yelling that i was in too much a bad mood to help, its too hot in my house (they never mentioned this and i would have just turned the aircon on if they said so), I'm a terrible bully and so obnoxious!.

I said idk what you want from me. Im trying to answer your questions. They yelled more of the same. I said, louder, 'don't call me names, I'm trying to help you - i am STILL willing to help you' and something like 'im trying to help you but i dont understand what youre asking'.

They then said OH YEAH, YOURE ANSWERING BUT SO OBNOXIOUS and started calling me a bully over and over as they packed their things and grabbed their bags. This is when I got angry and started raising my own voice or yelling back 'don't call me names. no. DONT CALL ME NAMES IN MY OWN HOUSE. OKAY IF YOU'RE CALLING ME NAMES GET OUT OF MY HOUSE. I can't remember fully but I probably said GTFOtowards the end. They would not stop calling me names and looking like I'd just called them a slurs for breathing wrong like I've done something that crazy/outrageous.

As they left I said sth like Thanks what a waste of time as I locked the door behind them flying out.

I text them after they left, trying to explain that to me this is just my job showing them what todo and that i dont know whar they want from me. They replied with 'go have a drink of water, you look like you need it'.


*MY THOUGHTS:*

For transparency; they asked me what was wrong multiple times - i figured i just dont look relaxed cus long day and got sunburned a bit waiting for car help. I was maybe getting a little annoyed by the end because they were getting annoyed with me and i did not understand what they wanted other than the facts. I almost feel like they thought I should be talking to them like a little kid or something? A couple of times they asked me where X / Y button was (things that don't exist at all) and I said 'that doesn't exist' and 'yeah, that's not a thing'. I want trying to be an asshole. But it doesn't exist.  Idk how else to explain things like this other than in a direct way in texh support. This is why im so unsure. As a person who came from a non-technical background, one of my biggest strengths in those jobs was being able to explain things simply for non-technical users. EDIT: after reading my own post I feel I should add that none of my responses were in a sarcastic tone. Slightly monotonal as I've had this scenario play out before with this person, so I actually try to have zero tone when answering so I'm not heard as though I have an attitude when answering their (admittedly strange) questions.

*TL;DR: I gave tech support to a family member and they cracked it and left because I was being 'so obnoxious'. I have no idea if I've done something wrong or not. I dont think I have but the other person is so insistent. I thought i was being the same as I was when tech support was my job. As a person with anon-tech background, I was always the one in my team better explaining stuff to novice users and dealing with customer interactions - i.e. not something latchkey kid who never grew a social mindset.*

My immediate reaction was, ‚Äúwhy would it be extra hot? I just wanted equal parts textures milk and espresso.‚Äù The barista emphatically responded with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what a Gibraltar is. Taking away the extra hot temp changes what the drink is.‚Äù

To my knowledge, a Gibraltar is just a Bay Area cortado served in a literal Gibraltar glass cup. What am I missing here?!

I came back to a ""ticket"" on my dash for what they deemed a ""walk off"" to Costco. 

I tried to dispute it with Diamond but no, they wanted $125 with the threat of going to collections if i didn't pay. Needless to say, I researched this a bit and never paid it, here's what I learned:

- Private parking companies hire people to watch their lots on busy days, it's their discretion to deal out ""tickets"" at the drop of a hat.
- A private parking ""ticket"" is not that at all. It's an invoice. They have no jurisdiction over you, or your licensing. This is different for municipal tickets, which can interfere with your license.
- They have access to your contact information through your license plate, which is information sold to them by ICBC.
- You will get increasingly threatening letters, first from the company saying they will take you to ""collections"", and then from said ""collections"". These are fake collection agencies, often in the same building and owned by the same company (Diamond especially). You can dispose of these, or as I did, send them back with some colourful language attached.
- They cannot take you to collections for an invoice, nor can they impact your credit score in any way.
- Hypothetically, they can sue you in small claims. However, this will not happen as the cost would far outweigh the invoice amount you ""owe"".
- They may tow you if you park in one of their lots again, but there's conflicting information on how many infractions you need before this happens. Cheaper to get new plates for $40 through ICBC if it's a concern.
- If they ever call you, which never happened to me, you simply say you demand all communications by mail and not to call again. They must abide by consumer protection BC.

1il8o3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superhero_Ideas/comments/1il8o3b/valiances_full_origin_story/,Valiance's FULL Origin Story,"**A Bright Beginning, Shadowed by Tragedy**

Freehawk City‚Äôs Dacre Street bustled with life on sunny mornings, the sidewalks filled with chatter, the scent of fresh coffee wafting from corner caf√©s. For a young boy like Varion Gerardis III, life seemed almost ordinary. At twelve years old, he was brilliant yet shy, his world revolving around his family and the sketches of futuristic gadgets in his notebooks. His father, Samson Gerardis, a world-renowned nanoscientist, nurtured Varion‚Äôs curiosity, often inviting him into their home laboratory, sharing secrets of technology that no one else had yet imagined.

Yet, behind the warmth of his childhood, shadows lurked. His mother‚Äôs tragic death during a kidnapping attempt had already fractured his world. His mother showed up to their doorstep, nothing but a head in a box. But what came next would shatter it entirely.

**The Night Everything Changed**

Varion‚Äôs fifteenth birthday had passed just weeks before the night his life collapsed. Sitting in his father‚Äôs study, reviewing old blueprints, he heard an unnatural crash. The air was still. Rushing downstairs, he found his father slumped over his desk‚Äîlifeless. No wounds, no sign of struggle. Just the eerie silence of death.

Authorities ruled it a heart attack, but Varion knew better. His father had always been in peak condition, maintaining rigorous health checks and following a disciplined lifestyle. The idea of sudden heart failure felt implausible. But more than that, something about the scene was off‚Äîthe way his father‚Äôs body was positioned, the eerie stillness of the study, as if it had been carefully arranged. No signs of distress, no toppled furniture, not even a trace of struggle. It was too clean. Too perfect. And perfection, in death, was rarely natural.

Desperate for answers, grief clawing at his insides, he stumbled into the laboratory‚Äîhis father‚Äôs sanctuary. The dim glow of monitors cast long shadows as he rifled through Samson‚Äôs research, seeking anything that might explain what had happened.

Then he saw it.

A containment unit buried beneath old research papers, hidden as if it were never meant to be found. Within it, a meteorite shimmered with an unnatural metallic glow. A strange force called to him. The moment his fingers brushed the surface, an icy shock coursed through his veins, tendrils of energy wrapping around him like a sentient force. The containment seals hissed open, unleashing a torrent of power that overwhelmed his senses. Light, sound, time‚Äîeverything twisted and warped. His mind trembled under the weight of something foreign.

A bond was formed.

**Samson‚Äôs Hidden Work**

What Varion never knew was that his father‚Äôs research wasn‚Äôt just revolutionary‚Äîit was dangerous. Samson had not only studied Nanotechnology, but he was also studying something else. Bound, the mysterious extraterrestrial substance that granted humans superhuman abilities. But he had also captured something far greater: an alien from another planet.

During his work for the Global Hero Oversight Agency (GHOA), Samson had secretly collaborated with L.E.A.F. (Local Experimentalists of Astronomic Forces), uncovering traces of unnatural energy that led to a meteorite that crashed outside the GHOA headquarters. GHOA deemed this meteorite dangerous, but Samson had other plans for it.¬†

Samson had stumbled upon him by sheer luck. As he was leaving GHOA‚Äôs headquarters, he caught a glimpse of the alien from his peripheral vision. Driven by relentless curiosity, he pursued Vermadion. Bound by the royal laws of his homeworld, which forbade him from harming intelligent species without provocation, Vermadion was forced to surrender. Using the Pandora Containment Unit, Samson sealed the being inside, dedicating years to studying his physiology. His findings were groundbreaking‚ÄîVermadion was composed of advanced nanorobotics, a living symphony of nanites.

However, such research bred jealousy. Julius Goyle, Samson‚Äôs colleague, harbored bitter resentment toward him. His envy festered, setting the stage for the betrayal that would claim Samson‚Äôs life.

**Meeting Vermadion**

When Varion awoke from his unconscious state, a voice‚Äîcommanding yet ancient‚Äîechoed in his mind.

‚ÄúYour father has fallen, but you stand. Who are you?‚Äù

Vermadion revealed his true identity: a royal warrior sent to Earth to investigate the rapid spread of Bound. He had planned to escape, to take over Samson‚Äôs body if necessary, but upon seeing Varion, something shifted. The boy, despite his grief, possessed an untapped potential. Rather than take over his body completely, Vermadion offered a choice: they would work together. In return for the alien‚Äôs strength, knowledge, and combat expertise, Varion would wield this power to help Vermadion study and search bound-related incidents.

But their partnership was not seamless. Vermadion‚Äôs warrior instincts clashed with Varion‚Äôs moral compass. The boy, reluctant to embrace his new abilities, hesitated at the idea of fighting. Vermadion, battle-hardened and pragmatic, saw hesitation as weakness.

**The First Encounter**

At eighteen, Varion faced his first real test. Walking home one evening, he stumbled upon a gang attacking a homeless family. His stomach twisted at the sight‚Äîthe cries of a mother shielding her child, the cruel laughter of the men towering over them. His body moved before his mind could catch up, instincts guiding him into the fray. Years of boxing training granted him an edge, but he was still outnumbered and outmatched. Blows rained down, and for the first time, he felt real fear‚Äîfear of failing, of being powerless.

Then, something shifted. His vision darkened at the edges, and an overwhelming surge of energy coursed through his veins. Vermadion took control. A flood of battle-hardened instincts overrode Varion‚Äôs hesitation, his body moving with lethal precision. Fists connected with uncanny force, sending the attackers sprawling. Bones cracked, gasps of pain filled the alley, and in mere seconds, it was over.

When Varion came back to himself, he stood amidst the wreckage. Blood speckled his fists, his breath ragged. The men groaned in agony, unconscious or barely moving. His heart pounded in his chest as he staggered back, hands trembling. Had he gone too far? Was this truly him, or was he simply a passenger in his own body?

Then his gaze fell upon the family‚Äîthe woman clutching her child, tears in her eyes. Gratitude, mixed with fear, shone on her face. Without thinking, he reached into his wallet and left behind $1,000‚Äîhis first act of reluctant heroism. Then, he vanished into the night, the weight of what had just transpired pressing heavily upon him.

**Becoming Valiance**

In the years that followed, Varion honed his abilities. By day, he became a respected researcher at Freehawk University, delving into nanotechnology, the same field his father had pioneered. But Freehawk‚Äôs underbelly was rife with corruption, and crime had spiraled since the discovery of Bound as a substance for superhuman augmentation.

That was when he saw him‚ÄîJulius Goyle. The same man who had once worked alongside his father, now a looming presence in the scientific community, and later in his time as Valiance, his greatest adversary as the villain Harbinger.

With Vermadion‚Äôs nanotechnology at his disposal, Varion crafted a suit‚Äîan extension of his extraterrestrial partner, capable of enhancing his physical prowess and concealing his identity. Freehawk‚Äôs streets were no longer ruled by fear alone. A new name whispered through the alleys, a symbol of defiance against the city‚Äôs corruption.

Valiance had risen.

**Gaining Clarity**

Years later, as Valiance, Varion learned the truth when fighting Chrono‚Äîhis father‚Äôs death had not been a random tragedy but a calculated erasure from existence itself. Deacon Goyle, operating under the alias Chrono, had traveled through time with a single mission: to prevent Varion‚Äôs birth by assassinating Samson Gerardis before he could father a child.

Deacon Goyle was the great grandchild of Julius Goyle, who had killed Varion‚Äôs father in order to maintain their family status in Freehawk, as in a distant future where Julius Goyle shined and was famous, they were successful and rich, and getting rid of Varion becoming Valiance was the only way he could maintain their status.

Due to a malfunction of Chrono‚Äôs ring, it had sent him to the time Varion was already born. Not knowing this information, Chrono still killed his father, unknowingly *starting* Varion‚Äôs journey into becoming Valiance.¬†

Armed with this knowledge, Valiance swore an oath: he would not only avenge his father‚Äôs murder but ensure that time itself would not be rewritten in favor of those who sought to undo him.",1,1739082856.0,Superhero_Ideas,0,1.0,False

1il8ejp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Original_Poetry/comments/1il8ejp/how_do_i_price_my_poetry_or_should_i_sell_it_for/,"How do I price my poetry, or should I ""sell"" it for free?","Hi everyone, I am preparing to release my second collection of poetry, which I will make available on¬†[my Buy Me A Coffee store](https://buymeacoffee.com/jasonberek/extras).

My poetry is very niche, reflecting themes of technology dystopia, opposition to AI and the impacts of technology on creativity. A lot of my work is inspired by Industrial music.

This poetry collection will feature about 80 - 100 poems. Is that too long for a digital ebook/ PDF download?

Also, I have a question about pricing. My last ebook/ PDF collection had only 20 poems, and I attempted to sell it for USD $5 - which was way over priced. I dropped it to FREE, but still didn't have many ""sales"".

I don't have a large audience (151 followers on X/ Twitter and 103 on Bluesky). I accept my work has limited economic value, but selling for FREE is painful. Just being honest. What price would you charge? I'm thinking of USD $2. Selling for USD $1 just feels very difficult.

Thoughts? Please be honest and give it to me how it is.

Thank you

1il8dvw,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/sf-transgender-historic-landmark-20154723.php,S.F. transgender landmark quietly inducted into National Register of Historic Place,"https://archive.is/DO3FG

‚ÄúAt a time when the White House has targeted transgender people, the National Register of Historic Places has quietly inducted a San Francisco building where a group of trans and queer community members famously resisted police harassment almost 60 years ago. 

‚ÄúThe old Compton‚Äôs Cafeteria site, at 101-102 Taylor St. in the Tenderloin, was inducted into the federal list of historic landmarks on Jan. 27 with no major announcements. The Bay Area Reporter first covered the designation, writing that news of the designation just reached members of the community last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe location was where the Compton‚Äôs Cafeteria riot is said to have happened on a ‚Äòhot night‚Äô in August 1966. The date of the event is unclear, but it is generally agreed that a drag queen patron of the 24-hour diner threw a cup of hot coffee at a police officer trying to arrest her without warrants. The move set off a riot among trans and queer patrons of the cafe protesting discrimination and harassment from police officers. The altercation shattered the cafe‚Äôs windows and destroyed a police car.

‚ÄúThe event predates the June 1969 Stonewall Inn riot in New York City, which is considered the start of the gay liberation movement.‚Äù

‚ÄúSan Francisco has recognized the blocks around the site of the riot as Compton‚Äôs Transgender Cultural District since June 2017, making it the world‚Äôs first legally recognized trans district. A plaque dated June 22, 2006, embedded in the sidewalk commemorates the site of the riot at Taylor and Turk streets, now occupied by a housing complex.‚Äù

‚ÄúHistorian Susan Stryker‚Äôs efforts have helped document the events from the Compton‚Äôs Cafeteria riot in the collective memory. Her 2005 documentary ‚ÄòScreaming Queens: The Riot at Compton‚Äôs Cafeteria‚Äô contains testimony from two people who saw the night‚Äôs unrest. The testimony includes tables being turned and sugar shakers busting through windows. Patrons fought police officers as they called for backup. In the documentary, Stryker highlights it was the ‚Äòfirst known instance of collective militant queer resistance to police in United States history.‚Äô‚Äù

I was just focusing on my career and coding. It's been 7 years of my coding career, and still, colleagues were my friends, but no one is from this state or even this country. No more real friends for the last 2 years; I didn‚Äôt even meet a new friend/person.

I used to have friends before, but due to some situation, I quit my job by trusting someone. before when i have a job, my friends used to come and chill, but when I quit my job, I had no money, and no one was there for me in my hard times. I didn't even have money for food. At that time, I used to ask for 1K/2K, but no one helped me. It took me 4 months to get a job again. I struggled alone, I cried alone, all alone, without anyone. and now everyone calls me for help.

I haven't even touched any human for the last few months, just staying at home, completing all my work, and sleeping. What should I really do to make myself socialize?

Wake up, coffee, work, sleep ‚Äì nothing else in life.  
working 12-14 hours a day cause i have no one to talk to, or no one with me to spend time on.

These lonely lines are really too hard now. When I look back, I am only seeing my career, no one else, and nothing. I have been living alone for the last three years. I was never this much hard for 2 years and 6 months, but now I am not able to. Every day, I wake up, and it's just me and me every day, the same.

What should I do now?

I learned a lesson that living alone for a long time with no one is really, really hard.

I would suggest: be social, make friends, and don't just focus only on your career like me, when you have everything but no one to spend time with, it feels empty.",63,1739081686.0,hyderabad,82,0.88,False

She stared at the unassuming man sat across from her, her eyes threatening to spill the tears she'd held back all night. 

""So,"" Mary said, taking a long drag ""this is it then?""

""Yes ma'am."" the man said calmly, his hands placed atop his crossed knees. 

""Please..."" she sucked in a sharp breath, a quiet sob escaping her lips. She pleaded with the man, hoping she could invoke some compassion within him. 

""Please let me have a few more years. I'm not ready to go.""

""Mary, you signed a contr-""

""I know I signed the goddamned contract! I was desperate! I didn't know what else to do!""

She placed her head in her hands and wept, the man patiently waiting for her speak again. She wiped her nose with the back of her hand and placed her cigarette, still smoldering, into the ash tray. The man stood and offered a hand to her. 

""What's it like?"" She whispered, taking his hand. The man laughed, guttural and deep.

""It's hell, Mary. What do you think it's like?""

<><><><><><>

Sheriff Thompson stepped out of his patrol vehicle with a grunt, being met by one of the officers on scene. 

""What we got?""

""Human remains. We found a hand, looks to be a woman's hand by the size and wedding ring. The neighbors found it and called, a man named Jacob Webb.""

With a nod, Sheriff Thompson walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

He stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and sulfur lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" He asked as he smeared some between his fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbor that found it?""

He was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer neither. I walk in a little ways 'n see a hand on that chair so run back to my house 'n call the law. Now we standin' here talkin.""

""Did Mary have any visitors tonight that you saw?""

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Any other kids?""

""She had a husband but he died shortly after their only boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin' back then and I s'pose the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin', the next day he's...not. He was up walkin' around again like he weren't ever sick.""

Sheriff Thompson scribbled notes into his notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

Sheriff finished his notes and closed his book, tucking it into his breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr. Webb nodded, walking slowly back to his house. Sheriff Thompson went back into Mary's, continuing his observation of the scene.

<><><><><><>

The Sheriff walks into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank ya, Sheriff."" The coroner took a long drink from his cup as he sat down, blowing out a short quick breath. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that damn house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed the pictures to the Sheriff. 

""Well, the ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the bigger bone fragments in the ashes.""

The sheriff looks down at his hands, rubbing them together as if he could still feel the ash on his fingertips.

""They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not scorched part of the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that.""

The sheriff stood quickly, pushing his chair back in frustration. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah! We've been going over this case for weeks, we've been talking to every medical examiner, firefighter, police force and goddamned self proclaimed arsonist around and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense!""

Josiah sat back, placing his interlaced fingers behind his head. 

""Sheriff, I've been talking to some colleagues of mine about this to get their opinion because I was stumped too. After some some long talks and a few too many whiskey sours, I might have something. But sheriff, you have to trust me.""

""You know I trust you, Josiah, I need SOMETHING in this case.""

Josiah sat forward, looking for that trust in the sheriff's eyes as he pulled a stack of disheveled research papers from his desk drawer.
