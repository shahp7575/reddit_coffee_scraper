It was a slow Tuesday. A woman in scrubs sat by the window, laptop open, surrounded by highlighters. At some point I walked over with the refill pot and she smiled and said, “Thanks. Are you in school too?”

I laughed. “No, just working.”

She looked at me for a second, the way doctors do when they’re about to ask a follow-up.

“You talk about science like you miss it,” she said. “Did you think about going into healthcare?”

I froze with the coffee pot in my hand.

When I was 18, I’d told everyone I was going to be a doctor. Then organic chemistry happened, and my dad got sick, and money got tight, and I told myself I’d “circle back” after I got a real job.

Years passed. I became a shift supervisor. I memorized drink recipes instead of pathways. Every once in a while, I’d Google “nontraditional premed stories” and then slam my laptop shut.

Standing in front of that stranger, I had a flash of a life where I was the one in scrubs at the table, complaining about charting instead of closing shifts.

“I wanted to,” I heard myself say. “I was scared I wouldn’t make it.”

She shrugged. “Everyone’s scared,” she said. “That part doesn’t go away. The question is whether you’re okay never finding out.”

When her order came up again, I saw the name on the sticker: Dr. Patel.

That night, after close, I pulled my old transcript and looked at my grades with adult eyes instead of panicked teenager eyes. They weren’t perfect—but they also weren’t the disaster I’d imagined.

The next month I registered for a community college bio class, just one. I told no one. It felt ridiculous at 27, doing ICE tables again. But every time I wanted to bail, I thought about that café and the question I hadn’t been able to answer:

If I’m not in school, why not?

I’m not in med school yet. I’m in the middle of my post-bacc now, juggling shifts and labs. But when customers ask “Are you in school?” I can finally say “Yeah,” without wanting to disappear.

1p4fdxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1p4fdxl/my_husband_wants_me_to_serve_his_mistress/,My Husband Wants Me To Serve His Mistress,"I had been married to Blake Wilson for five years, and in those five years, it seemed like every few days, a new woman was paraded through our door.

Each time, I would hear their voices filling the next room and turn on the recording to record them.

Five years and ninety-eight times.

Today, it was a fresh-faced, delicate college student.

Once they were done, Blake called for me to come in and clean up.

Kendall Davis lay lazily in his arms, a teasing smile playing on her lips as she spoke, ""Blake, is this the old, ugly wife you mentioned? ""

Blake idly ran his fingers through Kendall’s hair, offering nothing more than a dismissive grunt.

Kendall tossed the blanket aside, her skin marked with fresh hickeys, her grin wide. ""See? This is how a man reacts to a young, beautiful woman. As a woman, you really failed.""

I stayed silent, my gaze fixed on the floor, as I quietly cleaned up the mess.

Their laughter echoed through the room, a cruel reminder of the silence that surrounded me.

Once I retreated to my room, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the safe.

Five years had passed, and in all that time, it felt as though I had forgotten Blake and I were only bound by a contract.

One week. Just one more week and the divorce would be final.

——

The next morning, I woke early, as I always did.

Blake had already called me three times, demanding breakfast in his bedroom.

Without a second thought, I refused.

""Don't you have hands or feet? Should I feed you bite by bite?""

I ended the call just as Blake stormed into the room, his finger jabbing at me.

""Laura, who are you throwing a tantrum at? Don’t forget whose house you're in and who you're talking to!""

I didn’t respond. Instead, I lifted my eyes to meet his, studying the face I’d once known so well, the face I had loved.

I knew he had never loved me, but the sting came from realizing that, for five years, he had never truly seen me as a part of his life.

Finally, I lowered my gaze, my voice soft but firm. ""I’ll leave this house sooner or later.""

His anger flared, his voice rising. ""Leave this house? You’ve been living off me all this time. How will you survive when you’re gone?""

Before I could reply, Kendall’s voice cut through the tension, lazy and dripping with sarcasm.

""Oh, the old woman’s throwing a tantrum again? What’s wrong? Getting old and can’t bear seeing Blake with younger, prettier women?""

“If it bothers you so much, why don’t you just strip off your clothes and crawl into Blake’s bed? But—""

She laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. ""With that face, no man would even blink.""

I slammed the spoon down onto the table, the sound sharp and sudden, like a match sparking something deep inside me.

Blake, who had been standing nearby, scoffed.

“Did Kendall say something wrong? Are you throwing another tantrum?”

I pressed my lips together, silently clearing away the half-eaten cereal before heading toward the kitchen.

Kendall’s triumphant voice floated from the dining room. “This is too good. Just stay obedient and play your part as the old housewife.”

“Enough, stop talking.”

Blake’s tone was scolding, but I could hear the underlying indulgence in his words.

I stared at the faucet, my thoughts drifting like a fog, so much so that I almost let the water overflow.

Then, a hand reached from behind and turned off the faucet.

“What are you lost in?”

The voice was too close, and when I turned, I found myself trapped in Blake’s intense, unreadable gaze.

I lowered my head again, focusing on the dishes in front of me.

“It’s nothing. I was just thinking about what comes next after the divorce.”

“Divorce?” Blake’s voice was laced with amusement as if I’d just told him a joke. “You’ve been with me since college, playing the dutiful housewife for five years. You’ve been cut off from the world. After we part ways, what will you even do?”



Chapter 2

“Housekeeper? Or just a maid cleaning up after everyone else?”

Those words, sharp and cruel, echoed in my mind, a refrain I had grown all too familiar with.

At first, they stung, cutting through me like a sharp blade. I found myself questioning, doubting if I really was as worthless as they painted me to be.

But five years ago, I was just as young and radiant as Kendall.

Five years ago, my world had shattered. In an instant, my parents were ripped from me in a tragic accident, leaving only me and my ten-year-old brother battling leukemia.

Desperation had taken root in me, and there was no choice but to drop out of school. I juggled part-time jobs, anything to afford his treatment.

The quickest way to earn money? A nightclub, where I ended up as an escort.

When a client humiliated me, a bottle crashing into my forehead, I thought I’d reached the bottom.

But then, a hand reached down from the darkness, pulling me out.

That was the first time I met Blake.

He had appeared like an angel in my life, lifting me from the flames of my misery.

And in that moment, he offered me a lifeline, an unexpected marriage contract.

Five million in exchange for five years of my life.

I agreed.

He said he needed a wife to quiet his family's expectations, someone with a spotless past, and that he didn’t want me out in public often, only allowing me to go out twice a week.

I agreed.

So, I spent those five years almost entirely inside this grand mansion.

As for Blake, I thought I loved him. I accepted this ""imprisonment,"" and, oddly, I even found a strange comfort in it.

I truly believed I could be his wife forever.

But he never touched me, never allowed me into his inner world.

Then, one day, when he wasn’t home, I couldn’t fight the temptation any longer. I sneaked into his bedroom, and that’s when the truth hit me like a slap in the face.

Blake had always had a lover.

Kendall.

His five-years-younger neighbor.

I had long grown numb to Blake’s endless parade of women. To me, they were nothing more than fleeting distractions. And I, in my quiet submission, held onto the title of ""Mrs. Wilson"" as if it were a badge of honor.

But yesterday changed everything. The moment I saw Kendall stroll into that bedroom, the one I had never been allowed to set foot in for five years, it hit me like a jolt of electricity. I finally understood. It was time to leave.

""Laura?"" Blake’s voice sliced through my thoughts, thick with impatience. ""What’s going on in that head of yours?""

""You called me useless, right?"" I replied coolly, turning to face him. ""Maybe it’s time I find a job. A housekeeper, a maid, "" I paused, locking eyes with him. ""Five years. I haven’t broken any laws. Should I just waste away here forever?""

Blake opened his mouth to speak, but before he could, Kendall stepped out, sliding into a pristine, brand-new couture dress. It was the same dress Blake had kept locked away, never worn, waiting for the right moment. And now it was on Kendall.

""I didn’t expect you to know my size so well,"" she purred, twirling in front of him. The fabric swirled gracefully around her, her smile gleaming. ""Do you think it looks good?""

Blake took Kendall's hand, his usual indifference replaced by something soft, almost affectionate.

""They look amazing,"" he said, nodding. ""As long as you love them, I’ll buy you anything.""

And then, right there in front of me, they kissed.

Kendall, her cheeks tinged with a hint of shyness, reluctantly pulled away from Blake. ""There are others here..."" she murmured, her eyes briefly flickering to me. ""Do you think the dress Blake chose for me looks good?""

The dress clung to Kendall’s form, a shimmering fabric that wrapped around her like it had been made for her, luxurious, radiant, and perfectly suited to her youthful charm.

I nodded; my voice was soft yet genuine as I met her gaze.

""They’re stunning.""



Chapter 3

Kendall froze, momentarily caught off guard by my words. She stood there, her gaze flickering as if weighing my intent.

Blake’s brows furrowed, though his expression remained as unreadable as ever.

Seizing the chance, I silently slipped away from the kitchen, feeling a sense of liberation with each step I took.

The divorce agreement would take effect in a week, and I had only that precious time to pack my life and leave this place behind.

Back in the bedroom, I scrolled through rental listings on my phone, absorbed in my thoughts, when Blake’s voice cut through the air.

""I need to head to the company for a bit. Kendall will stay here, so you’ll take care of her.""

I raised an eyebrow, the confusion creeping into my tone. ""Am I now a housekeeper? Is she so helpless that she needs me to babysit her?""

I had always bowed to his commands without a second thought, but today, something had shifted in me. I found myself questioning him, challenging his authority with every word.

His face darkened, his voice dropping low and menacing. ""Laura, don’t forget who’s been keeping you. You’re here because of me, and you’ll do as I say. Don’t push me.""

I swallowed the bitter taste of my pride, nodding with reluctant compliance, the weight of his words pressing heavily on my chest.

Before leaving, Blake issued one last warning, his voice low and edged with authority. ""Kendall’s young. You’re responsible for her while I’m gone. If anything happens, don’t think I’ll let you off easy.""

With those words lingering in the air, Blake leaned down to kiss Kendall’s forehead, a tender, possessive gesture before he strode out, the sound of the door clicking shut reverberating in the silence.

Now, with only Kendall and me left in the living room, the atmosphere shifted. She slouched against the sofa, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips.

""I heard you’ve been married to Blake for five years,"" she said, her voice thick with amusement.

""Yes,"" I replied, my tone calm and measured, betraying nothing of the storm brewing inside me.

""But last night, he told me he’s never touched you!"" Kendall’s posture shifted as she tossed her hair back, revealing the dark mark on her neck. ""You must be twenty-six by now, still a …"" Her words hung in the air, sharp and probing.

She giggled, swaying gracefully like a delicate flower, before continuing, ""You must’ve heard us last night, right? Blake made sure you could hear everything from the next room. Oh, and I almost forgot, you’ve never experienced a man, have you? Especially someone as strong as Blake.""

Her laughter was almost too much to bear. ""What a shame. At your age, I doubt anyone would touch you, except for maybe you chasing after them, right?""

I furrowed my brows, disbelief creeping into my thoughts. I hadn’t expected Blake’s hidden rose to speak with such venom.

Calmly, I answered, ""Everyone lives their life differently. I don’t base my existence on any man.""

Kendall’s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced by a sneer. ""A woman who’s been living off a man, playing housewife for five years, probably has no room to talk, huh?""

I chose not to engage further, sitting down on the opposite end of the sofa as I continued my search for a place to rent.

Kendall couldn’t stand the sight of me remaining so calm and composed. It didn’t take long for her to start pushing my buttons, trying to boss me around.

The last time, she complained that the coffee I made was too cold and demanded I pour boiling water to fix it. Then, with the slyest of smiles, she pretended to spill it—most of the water splashed onto me while just a few drops landed on her wrist.

Her cry echoed through the room, sharp and dramatic.

""Blake, it hurts so much...""

By the time Blake rushed in, his face twisted in alarm, Kendall was already in full meltdown mode.

She showed him the small burn on her wrist, and he fussed over it for a moment before turning to me, his anger flaring.

With a forceful slap, he sent me crashing to the ground.

""Didn’t I tell you to take care of Kendall? Is this how you do it?!""

His voice was cold with fury. ""If even the smallest mark appears on her, I’ll make sure you suffer ten times worse.""

Without another word, Blake grabbed Kendall and rushed her off to the hospital, leaving me kneeling on the floor.

I lifted my nightgown, the red welts on my thighs already burning with the sting of the water.



Chapter 4

I lowered my gaze, the world before me slipping into a haze. Large, hot tears splashed onto my swollen knees.

The pain from the wound was sharp, but it barely scratched the surface compared to the ache in my heart.

I hailed a taxi, the loneliness in the backseat a cruel reminder of what I was leaving behind.

As the doctor tended to my injury, she muttered about the patient in the next room, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""These girls today are just so spoiled,"" she sighed. ""A tiny burn, barely the size of a fingernail, and her boyfriend called the director. He threatened to shut down the whole hospital if she got a scar...""

She paused, a wistful tone taking over. ""You don’t get it. That’s what it means to be loved. I envy her. She has it all—handsome, rich, devoted. She’s got a man who’d do anything for her...""

I stared down at the grotesque burn on my thigh, an involuntary sneer twisting my lips.

Blake was indeed the perfect man from the outside—handsome, wealthy, and all-consuming. But what did it all mean without love?

After the doctor finished, I sat on a bench outside the ward, trying to steady myself, lost in thought.

Then, Blake and Kendall appeared, walking toward me.

When Blake saw the bandages on my leg, his frown deepened.

""You got hurt too? Why didn’t you say anything?""

Before I could answer, he continued, his tone judgmental. ""Well, that’s your fault. You can’t even carry a cup of water properly. Luckily, Kendall didn’t get hurt. Otherwise...""

Blake, ever the picture of cold indifference, stood there, his arms wrapped tightly around Kendall.

Kendall leaned sweetly into him, her voice soft with feigned innocence. ""Don’t blame her, Blake. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have been so selfish, asking her to take care of me...""

Blake’s arms tightened around Kendall protectively as if he were shielding her from any harm.

""Don’t be silly. I’ve raised her for five years. Even if you treat her like a servant, it’s still your responsibility.""

""As long as you’re happy, you can make her do anything,"" Kendall added, her voice dripping with sweetness.

With that, they left, walking off as if nothing had happened.

Not once did Blake care to ask about my injury, never once sparing a thought for the pain I was in.

I lowered my head, my limbs too weak to move. I tried a few times, but I couldn’t find the strength to walk.

""Miss, would you like me to contact your husband?"" the nurse asked gently, her voice full of concern.

I watched them disappear down the hallway, and a bitter smile curled on my lips.

""No. We’ll be divorced soon,"" I murmured, my voice barely audible.

A week passed, and still no sign of Blake.

He had taken Kendall to New York, leaving me behind in this empty villa.

Each day, Kendall sent me photos—pictures of them embracing beneath the Statue of Liberty, kissing amid the bustling crowd of Times Square, kneeling before a sky ablaze with fireworks.

There were too many to count.

The final night before the five-year mark, I hid beneath the covers, alone in the vast emptiness of the villa.

I flipped through the photos, my hands trembling, each image a sharp reminder of the love I would never have.

By the time I reached the last one, my tears fell uncontrollably, slipping through my fingers like sand.

That night, I finally pulled away the light that had once warmed me, casting me into a cold, unfamiliar darkness.

When the divorce agreement took effect, Blake still hadn’t returned home.

I never got the chance to say a proper goodbye.

With a heavy heart, I packed up everything that was mine, placing the divorce agreement neatly on the coffee table.

I took one last, lingering glance at the villa that had held me captive for five years, its walls now nothing more than cold memories, before walking away without a single look back.

From that moment on, I would be free.

A free soul, no longer shackled by the chains of anyone or anything.

It was half a month later when Blake called, just as I was holding an invitation from the renowned designer Solomon Jennings.



Chapter 5

For five long years, Blake never let me step beyond the walls of the villa. Trapped in my gilded cage, I poured my soul into sketching jewelry designs.

During that time, I collaborated on several occasions with Solomon’s studio, and a few pieces from their latest collection bore my signature touch.

Over the years, Solomon had extended countless invitations for me to join his team, but bound by my contract with Blake, I had always declined.

This time, when the offer came, I finally said yes.

The phone rang not long after, and Blake’s icy tone cut through the line.

""Where are you?""

His voice dripped with entitlement. ""Didn’t I make myself clear? I don’t want my wife parading around for everyone to see. Get back here. Kendall is moving into the villa, and you’re supposed to take care of her.""

Take care of her?

I let out a dry laugh and replied as coolly as ever. ""What’s the matter, Blake? Did Kendall lose her hands or her legs? Or is the great Wilson family suddenly too poor to hire a nanny?""

Blake’s fury crackled through the phone like a storm.

""Who gave you the right to talk to me like that?"" His voice was sharp, brimming with contempt. ""Get back here right now, or I’ll freeze your card! Let’s see how long you last in Seattle without me!""

The call ended abruptly, his anger lingering in the silence.

I couldn’t help but chuckle as I tossed my phone onto the couch. His threats, once suffocating, now felt almost laughable.

Riker Brown, my brother and confidant, picked up my phone and glanced at the screen, his frown deepening. ""Have you made up your mind? Once the divorce is final, there’s no turning back.""

He paused, his tone softening. ""Are you really okay with that?""

Over the years, Riker had been my rock, the only person I could trust with the truths I didn’t dare admit to anyone else. Even the hidden feelings I had buried deep in my heart were no secret to him.

Just then, my phone buzzed with a new message. I hesitated before checking it, and there it was, another photo from Kendall.

In the picture, Blake was on one knee, his smile radiant as he slipped a dazzling diamond ring onto Kendall’s finger. Her laughter, frozen in time, seemed to mock me.

The image hit me like a punch to the chest. My heart, long numbed by years of neglect, suddenly felt as if it had been shattered into a thousand pieces. Each jagged edge tore at me, making every breath feel like a struggle.

For five long years, I had waited—waited for something I never dared to hope for. Yet, with nothing more than a flick of her finger, she had it all handed to her on a silver platter.

“At peace with it,” I murmured, shutting off my phone as a hollow smile tugged at my lips.

This was nothing new. I had anticipated it all along.

From the very beginning, I had known what this was, a transaction, plain and simple.

Time and money exchanged like currency, and with the contract finally reaching its end, it was my turn to walk away.

The next day, Blake called relentlessly. I watched his name flash on my screen over and over but didn’t answer even once.

When his calls were met with silence, his anger came through in a text instead.

\[If you don’t come back now, then don’t bother coming back at all!\]

I almost laughed at the irony. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to remind him to read the divorce agreement waiting neatly on the coffee table, but before I could send anything, another message appeared, this time from Kendall.

The photo loaded slowly, but the moment it appeared, it was like a slap to the face. There she was, draped in a pristine white wedding dress, her radiant smile glowing as she leaned into Blake’s arms. The pictures kept coming, photo after photo of their apparent happiness.

Wedding photos.

My chest tightened, but I forced myself to scroll through the messages that followed.

\[We’re already preparing for the wedding. So when is the intruder planning to leave the Wilson family?\]

\[If you behave yourself, maybe I’ll even let you attend the wedding. Wouldn’t that be fun?\]

\[Jealous, aren’t you? He never even thought about planning a wedding for you. But the moment I mentioned it, he couldn’t wait to make it happen.\]

Each word cut deeper than the last. My hands trembled, and with every message, the pain buried deep within me surfaced like a tidal wave. I couldn’t take any more.

Without reading the rest, I blocked her number and set the phone down.

After doing that, I opened my email and finally replied to Solomon, confirming the time to join his studio.

October 23rd.

The day Blake and Kendall tied the knot.

He embraced his happiness with open arms, while I silently vowed to vanish from his world forever.

At the venue, Kendall was glowing, her laughter echoing through the room as she meticulously chose her reception dress. She radiated joy, a picture-perfect bride basking in the love and adoration surrounding her.

From across the room, Blake watched her. This was everything he had ever dreamed of, standing on the brink of marrying the woman he had always claimed to love. Yet, beneath the surface, a shadow lingered. His heart felt heavy, veiled by an unshakable mist that left him restless as if a piece of the puzzle was missing.

Unable to resist, he pulled out his phone and opened the chat with me. The screen lit up with his last message from the day before, a sharp warning that if I didn’t return home, he’d cut me off financially.

There was no reply. Just silence.

For five years, I had been the perfect picture of compliance, never once defying his authority.

In all that time, I had never stayed away this long.

Irritated, Blake fired off another message.

\[What childish tantrum are you throwing now?\]

But as he hit send, a glaring red exclamation mark greeted him. The message hadn’t gone through.

I had blocked him.

Fury surged through him as he tried calling me, only to be met with the cold realization that his calls had been blocked as well.

What game was she playing?

Without wasting a second, he grabbed his phone and barked orders to his assistant.

“Freeze Laura’s supplementary card immediately and restrict all her spending!”

Without access to money, he thought, she and her brother wouldn’t last long in this city. They’d come crawling back.

There was a brief silence on the other end before the assistant hesitantly spoke.

“Sir, for the past five years, she hasn’t used her supplementary card even once.”

1p4fc75,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1p4fc75/montreal_early_20s_f_seeking_6070_seniors_to/,​[Montreal] Early 20s F seeking 60/70+ seniors to share experiences and enjoy activities with!,"Hello everyone,
I'm a woman in my early twenties living in Montreal, and I’m reaching out for some unconventional social advice!
I've always had a deep appreciation for the wisdom and extensive life experience that comes with age. I'd love to expand my social circle and find gentlemen (or ladies!) aged 60, 70, or older in Montreal to spend quality time with.
I m very fascinated by the music and the culture popular during their younger ages .
 Activities I'd love to share:
This is purely for social companionship and learning—not dating. I'm hoping to find people to:
Talk and Listen: Hear stories from their past, or discuss history, art, and culture.
Cultural Outings: Attend the symphony, visit art exhibitions, or go to historical lectures together.
Quiet Relaxation: Enjoy a nice coffee at a cozy café or have a sophisticated lunch/dinner.
 My Question is:
I know seniors in this age group don't use typical social apps. Where should I be looking in Montreal to find these elderly folks who are open to connecting and sharing with a younger person like me?
Are there specific community centers, cultural clubs, senior learning classes, or cafés that are popular meeting spots?
Are there any volunteer opportunities that attract a lot of active seniors?
Any specific location recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thank you to all the kind people of Montreal!",1,1763878140.0,montreal,3,0.67,False

1p4fbpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1p4fbpl/may_be_date/,May be Date..,"Hey, M here. North Indian guy who recently moved to Hyderabad and still can’t speak Telugu — mostly just smiling and pointing at things. I work in tech near Gachibowli and honestly, dating apps feel like a full-time job with no long-term connections lately, so trying my luck here instead.

I’m big on coffee, concerts, love traveling whenever I get the chance, and my playlists are mostly techno/house these days, if you are in tech we can talk a word or two about that too. I enjoy conversations that go a bit deeper than the usual “so what do you do?” small talk — more like the random stuff that actually helps you know a person.

If you’re somewhere around this side of the city (Gachibowli) and also open to meeting new people without making it weird or rushed, maybe we start with a chat here and see if we vibe. And if we do, a coffee date is always easy.

Who’s sick of starting chats, and then getting ghosted? My real question is, why is it so hard to make friendships that actually last? It seems like most interactions are just split moment, never more than an hour or two. 

Anyways, I’m looking to chat, hang out, chill, complain about the day, share stories, and just bond. 

Little about me, I’m a coffee addict, dog lover, outdoors lover, game enjoyer. I’m down to share doggos pics, play games, or just shoot the shit.

1p4faor,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1p4faor/kolkata_international_airport/,Kolkata International (?) Airport,"Let me start by saying that I grew up in Kolkata and love the city to bits. I used to live near Dumdum and parents worked at the airport so we have seen the whole transitioning of Dumdum Airport to NSCBI Airport.

The exterior looks great, architecture and design wise. But I was appalled at the international airport. The airport has flights arriving from major cities like Abu Dhabi, Doha, London, San Francisco, Singapore, etc. but when you’re departing from the international airport, it’s seriously amusing how less of an effort was made to attract businesses and outlets to give one the look and feel of a truly “international airport”.

You can’t even get a decent barista coffee. I ordered a cuppa only to realize it was coming from a machine, and wasn’t being made by a barista. Food options are minimal as well. There are no international brands apart from the ones in the duty free shops. Kolkata international airport really disappoints. You don’t feel like having a look around and want to jump on your plane to get out of there asap. The only saving grace are the clean toilets. And that they have toilet paper which is a luxury by Indian standards!!

I also noticed that the lounge was also overcrowded. Everywhere in the world where I have travelled, the lounge feels like a place to escape where you can have a meal and a nap before your flight. But this odd night, there were around 50 people queued to enter the lounge which makes it less special, I guess. 

I feel Kolkata has so much potential to improve the international airport experience but is just not doing enough. Does anyone know why or the politics or bureaucracy behind it? ",2,1763877992.0,kolkata,1,0.75,False

The wine is still young despite the age but a pleasure to drink. 

Visual> Color is medium garnet at the edge fading from a medium ruby core. 

Nose> Clean, Medium plus intensity of developed but crunchy red and dark fruit (red cherry, boysenberry, blackberry, bramble) organic (dried leaves), mineral (graphite), and secondary (cigar box, toasted oak, clove, bay leave, coffee bean, coco) 

On the palate > it's pretty classic St Estephe - high acid (cool clay soils), high finely grained tannins, silky texture, medium alcohol, medium Body medium plus intensity echoing the nose but with coffee a bit more overt. The finish lingers. 

Conclusion> Outstanding wine. The balance is there with high acid and fine tannins matching intense crunchy fruit, and intensely carrying through the mid palate and the finish. Alcohol is in check at 13.5%. Lots of complexity from secondary and tertiary complimenting crunchy fruit. Drinking great now but could develop another 15 years. 

Score. 94. Typicity is clearly St Estephe and a great example.  I'd expect this to get better with age given structure and intensity.

TLDR: I’ve been dumped twice in two months by a ND girl I really like 😔

We met on a dating app and met for coffee a week later. Connected really well and met 2/3 times the same week. Very intimate and close, fast. Was amazing.
Next week - still good and a couple of dates/meet ups.
Then at the end of 2 weeks, she says she cannot date at the moment - ex addiction problems, friend with health issues, so no time - ok, fine. I was pretty sad and accepted it is what it is.
I did use ChatGPT for advice when I found out about ND as I wanted to understand her mind more and approach her with the utmost care etc. Naturally, this did explain a little bit.
Then she messaged 2 weeks later to meet for coffee - which I obviously went to. However, a little more flippant this time as in just still being myself but a little joke here and there about no contact for a while.
Fast forward another 2 weeks… Same thing happened again albeit with what I thought were mega breakthroughs…
1. She wanted to talk more and tell me about her past etc.
2. Before she left for a vacation, she talked about me to her friend and then she seemed to get even closer. Made me really happy.
Then she comes back from vacation and I hadn’t seen her for a few days when back and push a little to see her and that’s when she decided it was over again.
I appreciate the ND and likely avoidance issues here (YT helped a lot) but I just feel like we actually could’ve been good together. 
Anyways, just wanted to put it down and share.

Such a shame really, I feel. If she does come back again (lol), I can’t do the exact same thing…",1,1763877826.0,Neurodivergent,0,1.0,False

1p4f5t9,https://i.redd.it/qvd8l2p9tx2g1.jpeg,"SetBusters!!!  23/11/2025, Successful Mission!","Small group of us nationwide play a game called 'SetBusters' where the goal is to get past security or perimeter guards on film sets, grab a treat from the provided crew snacks area. Proof of mission is to snap a selfie and G.T.F.O. We also all work on productions/live events, so we have a little more knowledge on what's about to happen. 

I was driving across town tonight helping deliver an appliance with my brother. Along the way I drove by an active filming location - seeing the gear trucks, vans, carts and lights along the sidewalks I decided it was ON! I'd finished my delivery and doubled back about 2 Km. Parked my Hi-Lux truck around the corner and added some normal crew gear to my belt loops. Tonight all I had was yellow leather work gloves and a carabiner with a few spools of coloured electrical tape. Put on my beanie cap and pulled the hood of my sweatshirt up and headed in.  
  
I passed around some yellow barrier tapes and a few clueless production assistants, I milled at a corner scrolling my phone while assessing the scene around me. Determined it was an active set (versus a pre-light or set strike) from hearing people yelling ""Cut, lets go again"" from inside a building and seeing others gathered around some monitors watching what was being shot inside. I recognized the grip/sparky truck from other shows I've worked and went to the rear lift to see if I knew anyone on it, unfortunately nobody I recognized. I saw the van/table for Craft Service/Crafty about 30m up the road so I headed that direction.   
  
Many cast/crew members hanging about having coffee or a snack, I grabbed a bag of crisps (Sunchips cheddar!) and a fizzy drink (Coca Cola with Santa on label- very fitting for the Christmas decor!) One charge hand did recognize me and said hello, chatted about holiday plans and such... very briefly. I took the required selfie/pics and headed across the road back to my truck, I was stopped by an onlooker who asked me ""Sir, uhhhh what is going on over there?"" I gave him our standard industry misdirection reply of ""We are shooting a Mayonaise commercial"" Having no idea what was actually being filmed (currently 4 productions in town)  
  
I started my truck and headed out. I got home soon after and reported to my buddies that I'd pulled off a successful 'SetBuster' and provided the needed photos as proof. We all had a laugh I had the crisps as a victory treat even sharing with my doggo. The 'gang' took an L last week on another attempt on a different set, so we were all happy for the victory tonight.   
  
Lighthearted fun with a minimum of risk/prosecution. Made for a fun evening and I hope a good read for you all. 

Happy Holidays!

Each time, I would hear their voices filling the next room and turn on the recording to record them.

Five years and ninety-eight times.

Today, it was a fresh-faced, delicate college student.

Once they were done, Blake called for me to come in and clean up.

Kendall Davis lay lazily in his arms, a teasing smile playing on her lips as she spoke, ""Blake, is this the old, ugly wife you mentioned? ""

Blake idly ran his fingers through Kendall’s hair, offering nothing more than a dismissive grunt.

Kendall tossed the blanket aside, her skin marked with fresh hickeys, her grin wide. ""See? This is how a man reacts to a young, beautiful woman. As a woman, you really failed.""

I stayed silent, my gaze fixed on the floor, as I quietly cleaned up the mess.

Their laughter echoed through the room, a cruel reminder of the silence that surrounded me.

Once I retreated to my room, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the safe.

Five years had passed, and in all that time, it felt as though I had forgotten Blake and I were only bound by a contract.

One week. Just one more week and the divorce would be final.

——

The next morning, I woke early, as I always did.

Blake had already called me three times, demanding breakfast in his bedroom.

Without a second thought, I refused.

""Don't you have hands or feet? Should I feed you bite by bite?""

I ended the call just as Blake stormed into the room, his finger jabbing at me.

""Laura, who are you throwing a tantrum at? Don’t forget whose house you're in and who you're talking to!""

I didn’t respond. Instead, I lifted my eyes to meet his, studying the face I’d once known so well, the face I had loved.

I knew he had never loved me, but the sting came from realizing that, for five years, he had never truly seen me as a part of his life.

Finally, I lowered my gaze, my voice soft but firm. ""I’ll leave this house sooner or later.""

His anger flared, his voice rising. ""Leave this house? You’ve been living off me all this time. How will you survive when you’re gone?""

Before I could reply, Kendall’s voice cut through the tension, lazy and dripping with sarcasm.

""Oh, the old woman’s throwing a tantrum again? What’s wrong? Getting old and can’t bear seeing Blake with younger, prettier women?""

“If it bothers you so much, why don’t you just strip off your clothes and crawl into Blake’s bed? But—""

She laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. ""With that face, no man would even blink.""

I slammed the spoon down onto the table, the sound sharp and sudden, like a match sparking something deep inside me.

Blake, who had been standing nearby, scoffed.

“Did Kendall say something wrong? Are you throwing another tantrum?”

I pressed my lips together, silently clearing away the half-eaten cereal before heading toward the kitchen.

Kendall’s triumphant voice floated from the dining room. “This is too good. Just stay obedient and play your part as the old housewife.”

“Enough, stop talking.”

Blake’s tone was scolding, but I could hear the underlying indulgence in his words.

I stared at the faucet, my thoughts drifting like a fog, so much so that I almost let the water overflow.

Then, a hand reached from behind and turned off the faucet.

“What are you lost in?”

The voice was too close, and when I turned, I found myself trapped in Blake’s intense, unreadable gaze.

I lowered my head again, focusing on the dishes in front of me.

“It’s nothing. I was just thinking about what comes next after the divorce.”

“Divorce?” Blake’s voice was laced with amusement as if I’d just told him a joke. “You’ve been with me since college, playing the dutiful housewife for five years. You’ve been cut off from the world. After we part ways, what will you even do?”



Chapter 2

“Housekeeper? Or just a maid cleaning up after everyone else?”

Those words, sharp and cruel, echoed in my mind, a refrain I had grown all too familiar with.

At first, they stung, cutting through me like a sharp blade. I found myself questioning, doubting if I really was as worthless as they painted me to be.

But five years ago, I was just as young and radiant as Kendall.

Five years ago, my world had shattered. In an instant, my parents were ripped from me in a tragic accident, leaving only me and my ten-year-old brother battling leukemia.

Desperation had taken root in me, and there was no choice but to drop out of school. I juggled part-time jobs, anything to afford his treatment.

The quickest way to earn money? A nightclub, where I ended up as an escort.

When a client humiliated me, a bottle crashing into my forehead, I thought I’d reached the bottom.

But then, a hand reached down from the darkness, pulling me out.

That was the first time I met Blake.

He had appeared like an angel in my life, lifting me from the flames of my misery.

And in that moment, he offered me a lifeline, an unexpected marriage contract.

Five million in exchange for five years of my life.

I agreed.

He said he needed a wife to quiet his family's expectations, someone with a spotless past, and that he didn’t want me out in public often, only allowing me to go out twice a week.

I agreed.

So, I spent those five years almost entirely inside this grand mansion.

As for Blake, I thought I loved him. I accepted this ""imprisonment,"" and, oddly, I even found a strange comfort in it.

I truly believed I could be his wife forever.

But he never touched me, never allowed me into his inner world.

Then, one day, when he wasn’t home, I couldn’t fight the temptation any longer. I sneaked into his bedroom, and that’s when the truth hit me like a slap in the face.

Blake had always had a lover.

Kendall.

His five-years-younger neighbor.

I had long grown numb to Blake’s endless parade of women. To me, they were nothing more than fleeting distractions. And I, in my quiet submission, held onto the title of ""Mrs. Wilson"" as if it were a badge of honor.

But yesterday changed everything. The moment I saw Kendall stroll into that bedroom, the one I had never been allowed to set foot in for five years, it hit me like a jolt of electricity. I finally understood. It was time to leave.

""Laura?"" Blake’s voice sliced through my thoughts, thick with impatience. ""What’s going on in that head of yours?""

""You called me useless, right?"" I replied coolly, turning to face him. ""Maybe it’s time I find a job. A housekeeper, a maid, "" I paused, locking eyes with him. ""Five years. I haven’t broken any laws. Should I just waste away here forever?""

Blake opened his mouth to speak, but before he could, Kendall stepped out, sliding into a pristine, brand-new couture dress. It was the same dress Blake had kept locked away, never worn, waiting for the right moment. And now it was on Kendall.

""I didn’t expect you to know my size so well,"" she purred, twirling in front of him. The fabric swirled gracefully around her, her smile gleaming. ""Do you think it looks good?""

Blake took Kendall's hand, his usual indifference replaced by something soft, almost affectionate.

""They look amazing,"" he said, nodding. ""As long as you love them, I’ll buy you anything.""

And then, right there in front of me, they kissed.

Kendall, her cheeks tinged with a hint of shyness, reluctantly pulled away from Blake. ""There are others here..."" she murmured, her eyes briefly flickering to me. ""Do you think the dress Blake chose for me looks good?""

The dress clung to Kendall’s form, a shimmering fabric that wrapped around her like it had been made for her, luxurious, radiant, and perfectly suited to her youthful charm.

I nodded; my voice was soft yet genuine as I met her gaze.

""They’re stunning.""



Chapter 3

Kendall froze, momentarily caught off guard by my words. She stood there, her gaze flickering as if weighing my intent.

Blake’s brows furrowed, though his expression remained as unreadable as ever.

Seizing the chance, I silently slipped away from the kitchen, feeling a sense of liberation with each step I took.

The divorce agreement would take effect in a week, and I had only that precious time to pack my life and leave this place behind.

Back in the bedroom, I scrolled through rental listings on my phone, absorbed in my thoughts, when Blake’s voice cut through the air.

""I need to head to the company for a bit. Kendall will stay here, so you’ll take care of her.""

I raised an eyebrow, the confusion creeping into my tone. ""Am I now a housekeeper? Is she so helpless that she needs me to babysit her?""

I had always bowed to his commands without a second thought, but today, something had shifted in me. I found myself questioning him, challenging his authority with every word.

His face darkened, his voice dropping low and menacing. ""Laura, don’t forget who’s been keeping you. You’re here because of me, and you’ll do as I say. Don’t push me.""

I swallowed the bitter taste of my pride, nodding with reluctant compliance, the weight of his words pressing heavily on my chest.

Before leaving, Blake issued one last warning, his voice low and edged with authority. ""Kendall’s young. You’re responsible for her while I’m gone. If anything happens, don’t think I’ll let you off easy.""

With those words lingering in the air, Blake leaned down to kiss Kendall’s forehead, a tender, possessive gesture before he strode out, the sound of the door clicking shut reverberating in the silence.

Now, with only Kendall and me left in the living room, the atmosphere shifted. She slouched against the sofa, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips.

""I heard you’ve been married to Blake for five years,"" she said, her voice thick with amusement.

""Yes,"" I replied, my tone calm and measured, betraying nothing of the storm brewing inside me.

""But last night, he told me he’s never touched you!"" Kendall’s posture shifted as she tossed her hair back, revealing the dark mark on her neck. ""You must be twenty-six by now, still a …"" Her words hung in the air, sharp and probing.

She giggled, swaying gracefully like a delicate flower, before continuing, ""You must’ve heard us last night, right? Blake made sure you could hear everything from the next room. Oh, and I almost forgot, you’ve never experienced a man, have you? Especially someone as strong as Blake.""

Her laughter was almost too much to bear. ""What a shame. At your age, I doubt anyone would touch you, except for maybe you chasing after them, right?""

I furrowed my brows, disbelief creeping into my thoughts. I hadn’t expected Blake’s hidden rose to speak with such venom.

Calmly, I answered, ""Everyone lives their life differently. I don’t base my existence on any man.""

Kendall’s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced by a sneer. ""A woman who’s been living off a man, playing housewife for five years, probably has no room to talk, huh?""

I chose not to engage further, sitting down on the opposite end of the sofa as I continued my search for a place to rent.

Kendall couldn’t stand the sight of me remaining so calm and composed. It didn’t take long for her to start pushing my buttons, trying to boss me around.

The last time, she complained that the coffee I made was too cold and demanded I pour boiling water to fix it. Then, with the slyest of smiles, she pretended to spill it—most of the water splashed onto me while just a few drops landed on her wrist.

Her cry echoed through the room, sharp and dramatic.

""Blake, it hurts so much...""

By the time Blake rushed in, his face twisted in alarm, Kendall was already in full meltdown mode.

She showed him the small burn on her wrist, and he fussed over it for a moment before turning to me, his anger flaring.

With a forceful slap, he sent me crashing to the ground.

""Didn’t I tell you to take care of Kendall? Is this how you do it?!""

His voice was cold with fury. ""If even the smallest mark appears on her, I’ll make sure you suffer ten times worse.""

Without another word, Blake grabbed Kendall and rushed her off to the hospital, leaving me kneeling on the floor.

I lifted my nightgown, the red welts on my thighs already burning with the sting of the water.



Chapter 4

I lowered my gaze, the world before me slipping into a haze. Large, hot tears splashed onto my swollen knees.

The pain from the wound was sharp, but it barely scratched the surface compared to the ache in my heart.

I hailed a taxi, the loneliness in the backseat a cruel reminder of what I was leaving behind.

As the doctor tended to my injury, she muttered about the patient in the next room, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""These girls today are just so spoiled,"" she sighed. ""A tiny burn, barely the size of a fingernail, and her boyfriend called the director. He threatened to shut down the whole hospital if she got a scar...""

She paused, a wistful tone taking over. ""You don’t get it. That’s what it means to be loved. I envy her. She has it all—handsome, rich, devoted. She’s got a man who’d do anything for her...""

I stared down at the grotesque burn on my thigh, an involuntary sneer twisting my lips.

Blake was indeed the perfect man from the outside—handsome, wealthy, and all-consuming. But what did it all mean without love?

After the doctor finished, I sat on a bench outside the ward, trying to steady myself, lost in thought.

Then, Blake and Kendall appeared, walking toward me.

When Blake saw the bandages on my leg, his frown deepened.

""You got hurt too? Why didn’t you say anything?""

Before I could answer, he continued, his tone judgmental. ""Well, that’s your fault. You can’t even carry a cup of water properly. Luckily, Kendall didn’t get hurt. Otherwise...""

Blake, ever the picture of cold indifference, stood there, his arms wrapped tightly around Kendall.

Kendall leaned sweetly into him, her voice soft with feigned innocence. ""Don’t blame her, Blake. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have been so selfish, asking her to take care of me...""

Blake’s arms tightened around Kendall protectively as if he were shielding her from any harm.

""Don’t be silly. I’ve raised her for five years. Even if you treat her like a servant, it’s still your responsibility.""

""As long as you’re happy, you can make her do anything,"" Kendall added, her voice dripping with sweetness.

With that, they left, walking off as if nothing had happened.

Not once did Blake care to ask about my injury, never once sparing a thought for the pain I was in.

I lowered my head, my limbs too weak to move. I tried a few times, but I couldn’t find the strength to walk.

""Miss, would you like me to contact your husband?"" the nurse asked gently, her voice full of concern.

I watched them disappear down the hallway, and a bitter smile curled on my lips.

""No. We’ll be divorced soon,"" I murmured, my voice barely audible.

A week passed, and still no sign of Blake.

He had taken Kendall to New York, leaving me behind in this empty villa.

Each day, Kendall sent me photos—pictures of them embracing beneath the Statue of Liberty, kissing amid the bustling crowd of Times Square, kneeling before a sky ablaze with fireworks.

There were too many to count.

The final night before the five-year mark, I hid beneath the covers, alone in the vast emptiness of the villa.

I flipped through the photos, my hands trembling, each image a sharp reminder of the love I would never have.

By the time I reached the last one, my tears fell uncontrollably, slipping through my fingers like sand.

That night, I finally pulled away the light that had once warmed me, casting me into a cold, unfamiliar darkness.

When the divorce agreement took effect, Blake still hadn’t returned home.

I never got the chance to say a proper goodbye.

With a heavy heart, I packed up everything that was mine, placing the divorce agreement neatly on the coffee table.

I took one last, lingering glance at the villa that had held me captive for five years, its walls now nothing more than cold memories, before walking away without a single look back.

From that moment on, I would be free.

A free soul, no longer shackled by the chains of anyone or anything.

It was half a month later when Blake called, just as I was holding an invitation from the renowned designer Solomon Jennings.



Chapter 5

For five long years, Blake never let me step beyond the walls of the villa. Trapped in my gilded cage, I poured my soul into sketching jewelry designs.

During that time, I collaborated on several occasions with Solomon’s studio, and a few pieces from their latest collection bore my signature touch.

Over the years, Solomon had extended countless invitations for me to join his team, but bound by my contract with Blake, I had always declined.

This time, when the offer came, I finally said yes.

The phone rang not long after, and Blake’s icy tone cut through the line.

""Where are you?""

His voice dripped with entitlement. ""Didn’t I make myself clear? I don’t want my wife parading around for everyone to see. Get back here. Kendall is moving into the villa, and you’re supposed to take care of her.""

Take care of her?

I let out a dry laugh and replied as coolly as ever. ""What’s the matter, Blake? Did Kendall lose her hands or her legs? Or is the great Wilson family suddenly too poor to hire a nanny?""

Blake’s fury crackled through the phone like a storm.

""Who gave you the right to talk to me like that?"" His voice was sharp, brimming with contempt. ""Get back here right now, or I’ll freeze your card! Let’s see how long you last in Seattle without me!""

The call ended abruptly, his anger lingering in the silence.

I couldn’t help but chuckle as I tossed my phone onto the couch. His threats, once suffocating, now felt almost laughable.

Riker Brown, my brother and confidant, picked up my phone and glanced at the screen, his frown deepening. ""Have you made up your mind? Once the divorce is final, there’s no turning back.""

He paused, his tone softening. ""Are you really okay with that?""

Over the years, Riker had been my rock, the only person I could trust with the truths I didn’t dare admit to anyone else. Even the hidden feelings I had buried deep in my heart were no secret to him.

Just then, my phone buzzed with a new message. I hesitated before checking it, and there it was, another photo from Kendall.

In the picture, Blake was on one knee, his smile radiant as he slipped a dazzling diamond ring onto Kendall’s finger. Her laughter, frozen in time, seemed to mock me.

The image hit me like a punch to the chest. My heart, long numbed by years of neglect, suddenly felt as if it had been shattered into a thousand pieces. Each jagged edge tore at me, making every breath feel like a struggle.

For five long years, I had waited—waited for something I never dared to hope for. Yet, with nothing more than a flick of her finger, she had it all handed to her on a silver platter.

“At peace with it,” I murmured, shutting off my phone as a hollow smile tugged at my lips.

This was nothing new. I had anticipated it all along.

From the very beginning, I had known what this was, a transaction, plain and simple.

Time and money exchanged like currency, and with the contract finally reaching its end, it was my turn to walk away.

The next day, Blake called relentlessly. I watched his name flash on my screen over and over but didn’t answer even once.

When his calls were met with silence, his anger came through in a text instead.

\[If you don’t come back now, then don’t bother coming back at all!\]

I almost laughed at the irony. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to remind him to read the divorce agreement waiting neatly on the coffee table, but before I could send anything, another message appeared, this time from Kendall.

The photo loaded slowly, but the moment it appeared, it was like a slap to the face. There she was, draped in a pristine white wedding dress, her radiant smile glowing as she leaned into Blake’s arms. The pictures kept coming, photo after photo of their apparent happiness.

Wedding photos.

My chest tightened, but I forced myself to scroll through the messages that followed.

\[We’re already preparing for the wedding. So when is the intruder planning to leave the Wilson family?\]

\[If you behave yourself, maybe I’ll even let you attend the wedding. Wouldn’t that be fun?\]

\[Jealous, aren’t you? He never even thought about planning a wedding for you. But the moment I mentioned it, he couldn’t wait to make it happen.\]

Each word cut deeper than the last. My hands trembled, and with every message, the pain buried deep within me surfaced like a tidal wave. I couldn’t take any more.

Without reading the rest, I blocked her number and set the phone down.

After doing that, I opened my email and finally replied to Solomon, confirming the time to join his studio.

October 23rd.

The day Blake and Kendall tied the knot.

He embraced his happiness with open arms, while I silently vowed to vanish from his world forever.

At the venue, Kendall was glowing, her laughter echoing through the room as she meticulously chose her reception dress. She radiated joy, a picture-perfect bride basking in the love and adoration surrounding her.

From across the room, Blake watched her. This was everything he had ever dreamed of, standing on the brink of marrying the woman he had always claimed to love. Yet, beneath the surface, a shadow lingered. His heart felt heavy, veiled by an unshakable mist that left him restless as if a piece of the puzzle was missing.

Unable to resist, he pulled out his phone and opened the chat with me. The screen lit up with his last message from the day before, a sharp warning that if I didn’t return home, he’d cut me off financially.

There was no reply. Just silence.

For five years, I had been the perfect picture of compliance, never once defying his authority.

In all that time, I had never stayed away this long.

Irritated, Blake fired off another message.

\[What childish tantrum are you throwing now?\]

But as he hit send, a glaring red exclamation mark greeted him. The message hadn’t gone through.

I had blocked him.

Fury surged through him as he tried calling me, only to be met with the cold realization that his calls had been blocked as well.

What game was she playing?

Without wasting a second, he grabbed his phone and barked orders to his assistant.

“Freeze Laura’s supplementary card immediately and restrict all her spending!”

Without access to money, he thought, she and her brother wouldn’t last long in this city. They’d come crawling back.

There was a brief silence on the other end before the assistant hesitantly spoke.

“Sir, for the past five years, she hasn’t used her supplementary card even once.”

Blake froze.

1p4evzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1p4evzz/terrified_of_potential_results/,Terrified of potential results,"So I’m 25F and getting my first colonoscopy Monday. I’m terrified. A couple of years ago I noticed tiny amounts of blood on my TP occasionally after going to the bathroom, but only if I had to wipe a ton. I didn’t get a colonoscopy. 

Fast forward to this year, I was on a ton of antibiotics early in the year and had some gastro issues but shrugged it off due to that. However, this summer I began noticing the small amounts of blood again, only if I had to wipe a lot. Then, I started my job in August and began having to go several times a day. All different kinds of stools. Sometimes mucus and gas. Once, there was a quarter sized drip of blood in my underwear. I called DR and got the referrals for colonoscopy. Since then, I’ve only used baby wipes and bleeding has essentially stopped. I’ve seen one tiny dot on my stool once. I do however have several cuts around my anus from excessive wiping. I am praying that’s what caused the blood. 

I also noticed if I don’t have coffee, I go once or less than once a day, which is my old normal. I used to be pretty considered for my whole life.  


Just really terrified. I guess looking for anyone who might have similar experiences. ",1,1763876570.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

1p4euwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p4euwo/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_best_friend/,AITAH for cutting off my best friend?,"I would truly appreciate it if someone can give my story some time to read it cuz it really affected me and i would love to have some help at please and thank you.

So I'll start from the beginning it all started when me (f21 now) i got into a school (19 back then) and i made some girl friends there and i was so happy about it cuz i always struggled with friendships since i was a kid and me and my high-school best friends we weren't meeting that much cuz they were in college and me in that school so anyway things were going all good we were like a group of 7 but then some shit happened and let's say I got close to 2 of them which I'm gonna refer to as (L) and (s).

 basically i was super close to (s) in the beginning cuz she approached me on my first day there and i was so happy about it and then we got to know (L) and she was also nice and (L) was a bit attached to me which i was okay with and keep in mind all this while i had a bf as well which we gonna refer to as (M) and he's 3 years older than me .

now everything is okay i love my friends and i love my bf and i was trying my best to manage hanging out with everyone so no one feels left out and lemme clarify something my bf (M) didn't like (L) and he thought she was a bad influence on me that's all cuz she once proposed we hangout me her and bunch of her guy friends i was like okay I'll see if my boyfriend is comfortable with that cuz personally I'm not comfortable with him hanging out with bunch of girls you see? And like me and him were on the same page and he said he was uncomfortable with that and why would she propose something like this to some who's already taken now personally i thought he was exaggerating cuz i know she didn't have bad intentions with that .

so now (L) knows that I'm only comfortable hanging out with her or just bunch of other gfs just no guys she got a bit pissed but tbh i kinda understood her point but anyway things are fine again keep in mind me and my bf were trying to hang out as much as we can cuz his family were planning to move out in the summer so we were both sad about it but as i said i was really trying to hangout with everyone at the same time but let's say 60% with my bf

 but whenever (L) needed help or anything i would be down for it and i would always accompany her on her side quests cuz she opened up to me about her household and how she doesn't like spending time there so i made sure me and her can go out almost whenever we can and even when finish classes early i would stay with her and spend time.

 now (s) wasn't hanging out with us that much but she was still considered my bestie tbh cuz i would sit next to her in class and i just loved her a lot anyway I'm not trying to flex what i did to (L) but i was really there for her like back in the day she didn't have a pc so i didn't mind us workin on my pc or sometimes doing her homeworks or just helping her and bringing my pc whenever she needed anyway i really loved her and i felt bad for what she was experiencing in her household.

 and keep in mind my bf was a bit bothered by her and he thought she was using me and even my high-school friends (they're 2 girls) they thought the same and they didn't like her that much ,
 anyway moving fast to one time i got bit by a stray cat while hanging out with (L) anyway my bf got worried and said that she ""a bad luck for me"" i didn't care about what he said and after it turned out i had to go to the hospital and get vaccinated and i had to do that for the next 7 days so anyway (L) felt bad about and she said she would love to come with me when i go get it on a certain day cuz she'll be free and after she'll go hangout with her guy friends i was like okay deal (tbh i don't remember if i was the one reaching out to her and askin her to come with me or was it the opposite but i remember feeling bad cuz i didn't wanna ruin her hangout)
 my bf i guess he said he wanted to come with me that day so i was like okay i have with who to go with so i went on and told her hey no need to worry (m) will accompany me and i could feel that she got mad me and suddenly started acting all cold so i asked her what's wrong and she said i was ditching her for a guy i explained to her the situation and how i didn't wanna ruin her hangout and tbh she stayed mad at me and i got a bit mad as well and ofc i told my bf about it ,i got vaccinated moving on to the next day i was going there alone this time cuz my bf was busy and i thought (L) was mad at me.

while I'm omw there i received a text from her and she apologized and said that she was close to the hospital (cuz the hospital is close to that school and her friends were picking her from there) i was like okay sure so the plan was like i get the vaccination and she's gonna be next to me and i get back home and she goes hanging out with her friends right? Well i made a mistake that day so after she came to the hospital with me her friends were supposed to come pick her up from there cuz the guys were meeting two other girls that day so she called one of them and he told her to walk to the spot they gonna meet up in, i felt bad and i told her i would love to walk with her and just like that we get to spend more time together so we started walkin then we met up with them and the girls were there and then she insisted i stay with her cuz she's feeling anxious i agreed we got into the restaurant and us the girls we all sat next to each other facing the guys there was 3 guys in total and one already had a gf so yeah she talked to me for a bit then she started chit-chatin with the other girls and i was texting my bf at the time and i didn't tell him that i went out with her and her friends.

 so yeah and i remember at that moment i told her how i was feeling bad cuz i have to lie to him about it and she seemed a bit upset anyway they finished eating me and (L) didn't eat anything so now i was supposed to go home and her can hangout with everyone else now well once we got out they told her that they're heading out and they're takin the two other girlies home she seemed a bit sad cuz apparently they usually give her a ride but this time they didn't she was like okay .

 and then she asked me if we can just hangout for a bit as usual i was like ofc we were just walking then she received a snap from of the guys showing that they all hanging out in a coffee shop and she got super disappointed sayin that they ditched her for two other girls and she's grateful I'm with her rn otherwise she would be alone blabla anyway that day passed.

 now i wanna say something that we were all students like none of us had a side job or anything so personally my dad would give my mom a monthly allowance and like my she would give me a certain amount on the daily basis at first i used to take a cab to get to class then i switched to the bus cuz it was super expensive and i wanted to save money to buy all my needs and i was skipping lunch to do that as well anyway (L) knew about this and she had it similar to me her dad would give her weekly allowance as well anyway so sometimes i would be tight on money and whenever we wanna buy stuff (L) somehow struggles to get her wallet out of her backpack or just directly asks me to get it out for her which i would be like there's no need imma pay at first i was okay with it but then it started getting a bit much and i would complain about this to my bf.

 anyway one day me (L) and (s) planned a hangout after school and we went for a walk around and while we were walkin (L) said she wanna have ice cream keep in mind i told her in advance that i didn't have much money that day and like my mom asked me to return the rest when i get back home so she knows I'm not overspending now she said that i was like okay ice-cream isn't that bad so i got the 3 of us some but it turned out it was a fancy one and it was expensive so i ended up spending all what i had but i didn't tell them cuz i didn't wanna ruin the vibes we kept walkin then we (s) took us to a spot to have lunch i wasn't going to have any tbh cuz i felt uncomfortable makin someone else pay for my lunch but (s) insisted and she paid for all of us after it was time to get back home (s) left cuz she has a car and (L) took the bus and for me i didn't have money so i was texting my bf telling him that I'm in a trouble and mom would kill me when she finds out i spent all my allowance and now i can't even take the bus back home and also i had my period and i didn't have pads on me nor in my place so he insisted on giving me a ride home i agreed cuz i didn't have another choice he also insisted on giving me money i declined and when i gor home i lied saying i used the money to buy pads which i didn't lol and ended up using paper tissue that month .

and i told (L) that i didn't have pads nor the money to buy it and she brought me a pack after a week which was super nice of her tbh ,anyway again we were having the times of our life and i was getting closer to them everyday and i truly loved my friend group.

moving on to the finals week now (L) was having other exams cuz she wasn't just a student in that school so it happened the both schools finals week were in the same time but our teachers were understanding to the situation and they let her and people like her pass their exams ahead of time or after they finish the other exams they got and i tried helping her in of her homeworks i even brought her my pc to work on it and i tried doing for her anyway she did it and i told her that i will bring her my pc to present her work if she wants but i won't be able to hangout after it cuz I'm meeting my bf cuz it might be our last meeting before his graduation and she flipped and got so mad at me sayin that there's no need to come to begin with this time i didn't apologize to her cuz i got super hurt and i told my bf about it and like i said they already didn't like each other to begin with anyway after few days she texted me saying 'do you hate me ?' Which ofc we ended talking it out and we were back on good terms again.
 anyway the summer break was there and it was my boyfriend's graduation day and i was invited and it was 2 days after my birthday on that day (s) texted me saying if we can hangout i said it will be for a short period of time cuz i have a graduation to attend she was okay with it then suddenly she was like dw go to your boyfriend's graduation i was like you sure ? She was like yeah anyway after it i found out that she made me a cake that and that was the reason she wanted me to come i felt so bad cuz i would've loved to go see her and appreciate her efforts but yeah i apologized about it and she also brought me a birthday gift when we started the 3rd semester

we started a new year and now things were a bit different cuz there's a new character and he was a guy I'm gonna refer to him as (t) now i saw him around already cuz we study in the same place and he used to date this super pretty alt girly so they were noticeable and we all thought they were cute together anyway we kinda interacted with him at the end of our 2nd semester while he was with his gf but it wasn't much but apparently (t) and his gf broke up in the summer break and also apparently one day him and (L) met in a lil event and they started talkin after it and they became friends (i wanna mention that (L) had a boyfriend at the time and they've been dating for the past 6 years or something).

 so anyway (t) started hanging out with us in school and also in that time i told my bf about him and that he shouldn't worry cuz we all thought (t) was gay so he's like a girls girl lol anyway my bf didn't like it and i wasn't really hanging out with (t) that much cuz i didn't wanna make my bf uncomfortable now keep in mind once we started the 3rd semester i had some struggles in my relationship and i already broke up with my bf twice during the summer break so things were a bit sensitive and (L) the other girls weren't that supportive and they would always mention how much me and him aren't meant for each other and he's toxic and controlling and somehow I fell for it and i broke up with him and it was official this time i thought that my girls knows what's good for me cuz as they said "" when you're in love we notice the stuff you don't"" and also in (L)'s defense she reads a lot of psychology books that's why she can read body language lol :)

 anyway i broke up with (M) and i started hanging out with (L),(t)and(s) and we were all having fun ut was basically an amazing friend groupe we would watch movies at night ,play anyway it was just amazing and tbh it made the breakup feel better

 after a while (L) and (s) wouldn't be able to hangout with me so i would end hanging out with (t) and tnh it was chill we would have lunch and walk around and i could tell that after a month he had a crush on me and tbh i felt the same but i wasn't sure if it was true so after it he would text me late at night after playing with (L) and(s) saying that talking to me feels like a fresh breath of air and stuff like that ,he would tell me the nicknames that he wants me to call him with and askin me to match outfits as well tbh idk why i turned a blind eye on all of the signs and i kept saying he likes his friends a lot and he appreciates platonic love so much maybe that's why cuz he told me about his ex best friend and how he was with her so i thought maybe it's the same but I'm not gonna lie i had a lil crush on him as well

 anyway,  one day we were on the bitch and the day before we went out with (L) and some of her friends Which surprisingly she didn't tell they'll be there but anyway i tend to get anxious around new people and she was busy with them and (t) noticed how anxious i was getting and i started walkin behind and pinching my arm blabla so he would check on me from times to times or even walk next to me and (L) noticed that and she would grab me and like keep me next to her when she gets the chance anyway and he asked the night before to match outfits together and (L) didn't like that as well which i understand it was wrong to do that 

moving to the day he confessed his love to me it was maybe 2 months after my breakup and we were sitting on the beach and he wrote me a lil paragraph now at first i panicked cuz i was thinking about (L) and (s) reaction to this and that i would ruin the friend group but also I wanted to do confess and tell him that i like him as well so i stayed quiet for a moment and then i told him that it was adorable and i got awkward and didn't know what to say after i decided to not telll him that i liked him cuz it wasn't fair but i ended up saying something dumb I said ""I'm not friend zoning you by doing this"" and he immediately took it as a yes and and at first i didn't notice that cuz as dumb as I am i thought by saying that he won't feel embarrassed or awkward around me but he took it as yes and then he seemed super happy and he started saying 'you're not prankin me right?"" And i felt so bad i was like okay lemme give it a try he's a good guy and my (L) and (s) likes him so why wouldn't they be supportive about it? Besides we can all hangout together and like that no one would feel left out or neglected

 so omw back home i texted them and told them that at beginning i was all happy and giggling on the bus until they started saying mean stuff and i started crying now i didn't wanna push it so I waited until i got home and texted (L) cuz (s) didn't wanna talk to me, and now things will take a twist and i talked to (L) and asked her if she was mad at me she said she was disappointed cuz she would've never done this and that she"" always had eyes on me"" when she said that and some mean stuff i told her that if i go and break up with him would we go back as we used to and (t) included and she agreed so i went on and i told him that we can't be together after it (t) went complaining to her saying that she forced me to do it and cuz tnh i told (L) that i only had a crush on him and it will go away within time and I'm gonna be honest they were mean to (t) as well 

but anyway after it me and him we kept talking and he convinced to give us a chance so i did that and i went to (L) and told her about my decision she got mad and she said some mean stuff as well after it (s) texted me as well saying mean stuff and calling me a pick me and that there was a rule of not dating (t) and when i told her when did we make this rule she said it was common sense anyway there was a lot of tension between us a lot of mean stuff were said to me and also to (t) and i didn't talk to them for a lil moment until stuff calmed a bit and i was crying to (t) about and at one point he asked me to show him what they been saying to me so i shared my screen and he saw what (L) said to me and he said that it was a confession now I did something wrong cuz I wanted to please (L) so i told her that i liked her as well and it was mutual so i understood that i hurt her feelings by doing that and i apologized but i knew it wouldn't be enough to undo the damage

 anyway after we planned to meet and talk about what happened face to face so we did that and (t) confronted (L) about all what she said to him or me stuff like ""thank you for dumping him for me "" and bringing up his past friendships blabla so after it we thought we were fine and we talked it out as adults after it one of (t) friends passed by and she stayed with us and somehow this friend and (L) got along and we thought it was good so i was walking with (t) and (s) while (L) and that friend were behind us we thought it was cute and all then when i got home that friend told (t) she would've done the same thing (L) did and he asked what she tell her and apparently she said a whole other version and didn't mention her confession nor all what she said to me from mean unnecessary stuff so (t) told her all what happened and she was understanding

 after that day i thought things are gonna be as it used to be and i tried staying close with them but i always would end up getting left in school cuz apparently they didn't like (t) anymore and they didn't wanna be around him so yeah i started pulling away as well and i would only hangout with (t) and i was getting disappointed a lot from their side so i lost hope and i was sad about it cuz i was the one who lost everything at the end but i tried focusing on my relationship with (t)

 and after a lil period (L) would text and askin for us to get back together and work on friendship which i end up discussing with (t) cuz he was around when i had no one and i didn't wanna do something to hurt him after all what he did to me anyway we started talkin again me and (L) and (s) as well and in that period there was some tension between me and (t) and tbh he felt threatened by (L) and he was scared i would break up with him again which (L) ended up convincing me to do saying that it shows in my eyes that i don't love him and I'm only hurting him by staying in this relationship so i listened to her and me and (t) broke up but we were on good terms and i promised him that I'm willing to hangout with him just as we used to and i did and 

after few days he was helping me on my pc with quick assist and then i had to leave so i told him that i would let him finish his work cuz i truly trusted him but when i got back i texted and he was so off and apparently he discovered that (L) pushed me to break up with him and he read our conversation and also some stuff i said on chatgpt cuz i used to vent when i had no one and i felt so bad cuz he really didn't deserve that and i realized that i shouldn't have listened to (L) so apologized and told him I'm ready to do whatever he wants as long as it means he will forgive me and we can even get back together and he said he would give our relationship a second chance under one condition which is me never talking to (L) again and as much as it broke i agreed cuz (L) caused so much damage and i wanted to stay with him like stayed with me when i had no one so after it i went to school with my puffy eyes and i told (L) and (s) that I'm back with (t) so it was obvious they weren't happy about it

 (L) left immediately and (s) was just there and the vibes were so off after it i left cuz it was too much anyway after this i told (L) that it would be for the best to keep a distance between us at least until the semester ends ,now obviously (L) and (s) were getting closer each day passes by and that was one of the reasons that made me lose hope of getting things as it used to be

 so anyway after it one time we had class and only me (s) and (L) attended it and (s) she was okay with being friends with both us and it meant a lot to me cuz i didn't wanna lose (s) anyway we finished our class and i got in the car with them and there was another friend there (L) brought with her so we sat there for a bit then (s) had to leave so got out of the car and that friend left as well so i was left with (L) and i told her I'm okay with staying with her until her dad comes pick her up so we were sitting and talking and she told me she's finally okay with me dating (t) and all and she'll always understand me and then (t) appeared out of nowhere and he saw me sitting next her and he seemed super upset so (L) hugged me and left

 and he was there saying that he bought me snacks because i was on my period anyway after it he started crying saying why i can't chose him and if am i in love with him so after it i felt so guilty and told him I'm ready to block her from everywhere and i texted her in front of him and told her with my final decision and i blocked her from everywhere now basically she went on and told (s) about cuz (s) came and ask me about it herself and she said that she's fine being our friend me and(L) even tho we're not talking anymore until the semester ended and (s) texted me saying she can't be my friend anymore so goodbye forever ,did i cry about this for the whole summer? Yes

 and tbh ( t) would try to cheer me up like buying me something i really wanted on my birthday or lil gifts like that and i appreciated that anyway the whole summer was depressing cuz i missed (L) and (s) and i felt like i was forced to leave them while i was still mourning losing them my ex (M) texted me and apparently he figured out that I'm dating (t) rn and he lost it and said a lot of mean stuff to me and to (t) as well i thought it would end up just here but one day one of my high-school friends stalked his acount and she found that him and (L) were following each other which made me puke cuz i said in the beginning these two hated each other

 anyway i texted (M) and apparently he was the one reaching out to her to ask about me and (t) and how we started dating anyway i blocked him after it cuz (t) wasn't comfortable with me talking to him and i respected that anyway (M) opened another public account and he started posting memes or just content that implies how I'm a slut amd stuff like that that's all cuz (L) told him some rumors she made about me

 anyway it was a hard period of time of going through this slut shaming over stuff i didn't even do and also my relationship with (t) was super draining until one day i decided to break up with him cuz i didn't see a point in our relationship our conversations were super shallow and it was obvious he was just attracted to me physically and we just didn't work he did a lot of stuff that drained me or just stuff i wasn't okay with to begin with so when i noticed that this relationship is bad i broke up with him and we were on good terms but we agreed that we won't be texting each other that much like it would be once a month or something , 2 weeks passed after my break (L) reached out to me sayin she wants closure now at first i didn't wanna reply cuz i was pissed that she went behind my back and talked to my ex cuz i would've never done that to her anyway i replied to her and we started talking i explained the whole situation of how (t) found out that she was the one pushing me to break up with him blabla 

and then after we agreed on meeting cuz apparently (s) wanted to talk to me after it she told me my ex(M) wanna text me as well i went on i found his text and he apologized i forgave him cuz i understood from where that hate was coming and i did him dirty , turned out he was dating a new girl as well and (L) already told me about it sayin she's just like me and he was suspicious at first that it was me with a fake acount so yeah after talking to him he said the same thing and he even said that he doesn't have feelings for her and they've been dating for a month but he couldn't forget about me (keep in mind by the moment we were talking it's been already 10 months since we broke up) and he confessed that he still had feelings for me and i told him even if i had feelings for him i won't be able to be with him cuz i don't wanna be home wrecker and he told me that's on him and he shouldn't have gotten himself into a relationship blabla 

anyway i told him that i don't feel comfortable talking to him while he was in a relationship cuz the girl is innocent at the end of the day .

 the after it  he texted me saying he broke up with her and he really did it ,

 i told (L) about this but yeah after it we planned our spot to hangout out and we agreed about when and where ,i went there we met it was okay i felt a bit odd but i truly missed them so ignored that i didn't let pay a penny penny that day i made sure to buy them snacks or whatever they wanted i even bought them some lil gifts anyway we spent the day together and we talked it out and everything okay except some lil things, for example we were walkin and they mentioned some incident happened between me and my ex (M) and it was a girl who insulted me in the most vulgar way and it made me cry my eyes out and i texted my ex about askin him if he knows that girl which turned out he did anyway they said that it was so funny what she said and she was creative, i ignored this one even tho i was on verge of crying when they said this we arrived to a coffee shop we sat there and we started talking a bit and (L) started showing me screenshots of her and (M) talking apparently they started talkin since July and they became like friends lol and she kept showing me screenshots saying he was sayin this and that and tbh he didn't say anything bad except the fact he told about the times where i would complain to him about her anyway i paid for us and then we walked around for a bit and they started telling me how did i accept dating (t) and they were makin jokes about it and they also talk about how they spent the summer together and like rubbing it in my face how they're closer than ever which made me feel like I'm third wheeling but i ignored that feeling 

now it was getting dark and we had to get back home and (s)kinda passed by my bus station when she's on her way home but apparently she wanted to give (L) a ride home which lives on the opposite side , and this didn't bother me cuz it's her car at the end of the day what bothered me is her dropping me in our school location while it's getting dark and she knows i never take the bus from there like she used to drop me in my bus station cuz i take two busses to get home anyway she was like okay get out of the car which i did and i kept crying while walking wondering if there's any busses left at this our and i didn't even have money to take a cab cuz i spent all my money on them .

anyway i managed to get home and i found texts from my ex (M) askin about me and i needed to vent so i told him about everything that happened on that day and how i felt betrayed cuz he went on and told her all these stuff but he ended up showing me what she (L) was saying about me and tbh i collapsed cuz i never thought my best friend would go and talk about me like this to my ex ,she literally lied about everything and she made up so many rumors denying the fact that she's bisexual and saying that she get disgusted by lesbians while at the same time she would come and tell me she's bisexual?

 I was shocked and this is literally 10% of what he showed me so i made up my mind i left her a text sayin to never reach out to me again and i blocked her (L) and (s) from everywhere.

 after a while i decided to give me and (M) another chance and we started dating again now apparently i forgot to block( L) on pintrest and me and (M) had a board there it was like a cute couples stuff basically she texted me on pintrest saying she's disappointed that I'm dating (M) again after all what he said about me but it didn't end here .

 so out of respect i already told (t) that I'm talkin to (M) again and he took it so badly and asked for his stuff back which i was okay with so i gave him back all his gifts, anyway after this (L) texted (t) telling him that i was cheating on him with (M) and she sent him a screenshot of a girl who texted (M) and he thought it was me and also she sent him a screenshot of that pintrest board saying that i never loved him 

I know it's a long story but it really affected my mental health and I'm not saying I didn't make some poor choices i did and i admit it but i wanna know if I'm the ahole for cutting them off?

So basically this is gonna be a long one like I'm gonna talk about everything in details and hopefully I'll be able to explain the whole situation cuz it's been eating me alive and therapy in my country is kinda considered a luxury and i want an honest opinion 

So I'll start from the beginning it all started when me (f21 now) i got into a school (19 back then) and i made some girl friends there and i was so happy about it cuz i always struggled with friendships since i was a kid and me and my high-school best friends we weren't meeting that much cuz they were in college and me in that school so anyway things were going all good we were like a group of 7 but then some shit happened and let's say I got close to 2 of them which I'm gonna refer to as (L) and (s).

 basically i was super close to (s) in the beginning cuz she approached me on my first day there and i was so happy about it and then we got to know (L) and she was also nice and (L) was a bit attached to me which i was okay with and keep in mind all this while i had a bf as well which we gonna refer to as (M) and he's 3 years older than me .

now everything is okay i love my friends and i love my bf and i was trying my best to manage hanging out with everyone so no one feels left out and lemme clarify something my bf (M) didn't like (L) and he thought she was a bad influence on me that's all cuz she once proposed we hangout me her and bunch of her guy friends i was like okay I'll see if my boyfriend is comfortable with that cuz personally I'm not comfortable with him hanging out with bunch of girls you see? And like me and him were on the same page and he said he was uncomfortable with that and why would she propose something like this to some who's already taken now personally i thought he was exaggerating cuz i know she didn't have bad intentions with that .

so now (L) knows that I'm only comfortable hanging out with her or just bunch of other gfs just no guys she got a bit pissed but tbh i kinda understood her point but anyway things are fine again keep in mind me and my bf were trying to hang out as much as we can cuz his family were planning to move out in the summer so we were both sad about it but as i said i was really trying to hangout with everyone at the same time but let's say 60% with my bf

 but whenever (L) needed help or anything i would be down for it and i would always accompany her on her side quests cuz she opened up to me about her household and how she doesn't like spending time there so i made sure me and her can go out almost whenever we can and even when finish classes early i would stay with her and spend time.

 now (s) wasn't hanging out with us that much but she was still considered my bestie tbh cuz i would sit next to her in class and i just loved her a lot anyway I'm not trying to flex what i did to (L) but i was really there for her like back in the day she didn't have a pc so i didn't mind us workin on my pc or sometimes doing her homeworks or just helping her and bringing my pc whenever she needed anyway i really loved her and i felt bad for what she was experiencing in her household.

 and keep in mind my bf was a bit bothered by her and he thought she was using me and even my high-school friends (they're 2 girls) they thought the same and they didn't like her that much ,
 anyway moving fast to one time i got bit by a stray cat while hanging out with (L) anyway my bf got worried and said that she ""a bad luck for me"" i didn't care about what he said and after it turned out i had to go to the hospital and get vaccinated and i had to do that for the next 7 days so anyway (L) felt bad about and she said she would love to come with me when i go get it on a certain day cuz she'll be free and after she'll go hangout with her guy friends i was like okay deal (tbh i don't remember if i was the one reaching out to her and askin her to come with me or was it the opposite but i remember feeling bad cuz i didn't wanna ruin her hangout)
 my bf i guess he said he wanted to come with me that day so i was like okay i have with who to go with so i went on and told her hey no need to worry (m) will accompany me and i could feel that she got mad me and suddenly started acting all cold so i asked her what's wrong and she said i was ditching her for a guy i explained to her the situation and how i didn't wanna ruin her hangout and tbh she stayed mad at me and i got a bit mad as well and ofc i told my bf about it ,i got vaccinated moving on to the next day i was going there alone this time cuz my bf was busy and i thought (L) was mad at me.

while I'm omw there i received a text from her and she apologized and said that she was close to the hospital (cuz the hospital is close to that school and her friends were picking her from there) i was like okay sure so the plan was like i get the vaccination and she's gonna be next to me and i get back home and she goes hanging out with her friends right? Well i made a mistake that day so after she came to the hospital with me her friends were supposed to come pick her up from there cuz the guys were meeting two other girls that day so she called one of them and he told her to walk to the spot they gonna meet up in, i felt bad and i told her i would love to walk with her and just like that we get to spend more time together so we started walkin then we met up with them and the girls were there and then she insisted i stay with her cuz she's feeling anxious i agreed we got into the restaurant and us the girls we all sat next to each other facing the guys there was 3 guys in total and one already had a gf so yeah she talked to me for a bit then she started chit-chatin with the other girls and i was texting my bf at the time and i didn't tell him that i went out with her and her friends.

 so yeah and i remember at that moment i told her how i was feeling bad cuz i have to lie to him about it and she seemed a bit upset anyway they finished eating me and (L) didn't eat anything so now i was supposed to go home and her can hangout with everyone else now well once we got out they told her that they're heading out and they're takin the two other girlies home she seemed a bit sad cuz apparently they usually give her a ride but this time they didn't she was like okay .

 and then she asked me if we can just hangout for a bit as usual i was like ofc we were just walking then she received a snap from of the guys showing that they all hanging out in a coffee shop and she got super disappointed sayin that they ditched her for two other girls and she's grateful I'm with her rn otherwise she would be alone blabla anyway that day passed.

 now i wanna say something that we were all students like none of us had a side job or anything so personally my dad would give my mom a monthly allowance and like my she would give me a certain amount on the daily basis at first i used to take a cab to get to class then i switched to the bus cuz it was super expensive and i wanted to save money to buy all my needs and i was skipping lunch to do that as well anyway (L) knew about this and she had it similar to me her dad would give her weekly allowance as well anyway so sometimes i would be tight on money and whenever we wanna buy stuff (L) somehow struggles to get her wallet out of her backpack or just directly asks me to get it out for her which i would be like there's no need imma pay at first i was okay with it but then it started getting a bit much and i would complain about this to my bf.

 anyway one day me (L) and (s) planned a hangout after school and we went for a walk around and while we were walkin (L) said she wanna have ice cream keep in mind i told her in advance that i didn't have much money that day and like my mom asked me to return the rest when i get back home so she knows I'm not overspending now she said that i was like okay ice-cream isn't that bad so i got the 3 of us some but it turned out it was a fancy one and it was expensive so i ended up spending all what i had but i didn't tell them cuz i didn't wanna ruin the vibes we kept walkin then we (s) took us to a spot to have lunch i wasn't going to have any tbh cuz i felt uncomfortable makin someone else pay for my lunch but (s) insisted and she paid for all of us after it was time to get back home (s) left cuz she has a car and (L) took the bus and for me i didn't have money so i was texting my bf telling him that I'm in a trouble and mom would kill me when she finds out i spent all my allowance and now i can't even take the bus back home and also i had my period and i didn't have pads on me nor in my place so he insisted on giving me a ride home i agreed cuz i didn't have another choice he also insisted on giving me money i declined and when i gor home i lied saying i used the money to buy pads which i didn't lol and ended up using paper tissue that month .

and i told (L) that i didn't have pads nor the money to buy it and she brought me a pack after a week which was super nice of her tbh ,anyway again we were having the times of our life and i was getting closer to them everyday and i truly loved my friend group.

moving on to the finals week now (L) was having other exams cuz she wasn't just a student in that school so it happened the both schools finals week were in the same time but our teachers were understanding to the situation and they let her and people like her pass their exams ahead of time or after they finish the other exams they got and i tried helping her in of her homeworks i even brought her my pc to work on it and i tried doing for her anyway she did it and i told her that i will bring her my pc to present her work if she wants but i won't be able to hangout after it cuz I'm meeting my bf cuz it might be our last meeting before his graduation and she flipped and got so mad at me sayin that there's no need to come to begin with this time i didn't apologize to her cuz i got super hurt and i told my bf about it and like i said they already didn't like each other to begin with anyway after few days she texted me saying 'do you hate me ?' Which ofc we ended talking it out and we were back on good terms again.
 anyway the summer break was there and it was my boyfriend's graduation day and i was invited and it was 2 days after my birthday on that day (s) texted me saying if we can hangout i said it will be for a short period of time cuz i have a graduation to attend she was okay with it then suddenly she was like dw go to your boyfriend's graduation i was like you sure ? She was like yeah anyway after it i found out that she made me a cake that and that was the reason she wanted me to come i felt so bad cuz i would've loved to go see her and appreciate her efforts but yeah i apologized about it and she also brought me a birthday gift when we started the 3rd semester

we started a new year and now things were a bit different cuz there's a new character and he was a guy I'm gonna refer to him as (t) now i saw him around already cuz we study in the same place and he used to date this super pretty alt girly so they were noticeable and we all thought they were cute together anyway we kinda interacted with him at the end of our 2nd semester while he was with his gf but it wasn't much but apparently (t) and his gf broke up in the summer break and also apparently one day him and (L) met in a lil event and they started talkin after it and they became friends (i wanna mention that (L) had a boyfriend at the time and they've been dating for the past 6 years or something).

 so anyway (t) started hanging out with us in school and also in that time i told my bf about him and that he shouldn't worry cuz we all thought (t) was gay so he's like a girls girl lol anyway my bf didn't like it and i wasn't really hanging out with (t) that much cuz i didn't wanna make my bf uncomfortable now keep in mind once we started the 3rd semester i had some struggles in my relationship and i already broke up with my bf twice during the summer break so things were a bit sensitive and (L) the other girls weren't that supportive and they would always mention how much me and him aren't meant for each other and he's toxic and controlling and somehow I fell for it and i broke up with him and it was official this time i thought that my girls knows what's good for me cuz as they said "" when you're in love we notice the stuff you don't"" and also in (L)'s defense she reads a lot of psychology books that's why she can read body language lol :)

 anyway i broke up with (M) and i started hanging out with (L),(t)and(s) and we were all having fun ut was basically an amazing friend groupe we would watch movies at night ,play anyway it was just amazing and tbh it made the breakup feel better

 after a while (L) and (s) wouldn't be able to hangout with me so i would end hanging out with (t) and tnh it was chill we would have lunch and walk around and i could tell that after a month he had a crush on me and tbh i felt the same but i wasn't sure if it was true so after it he would text me late at night after playing with (L) and(s) saying that talking to me feels like a fresh breath of air and stuff like that ,he would tell me the nicknames that he wants me to call him with and askin me to match outfits as well tbh idk why i turned a blind eye on all of the signs and i kept saying he likes his friends a lot and he appreciates platonic love so much maybe that's why cuz he told me about his ex best friend and how he was with her so i thought maybe it's the same but I'm not gonna lie i had a lil crush on him as well

 anyway,  one day we were on the bitch and the day before we went out with (L) and some of her friends Which surprisingly she didn't tell they'll be there but anyway i tend to get anxious around new people and she was busy with them and (t) noticed how anxious i was getting and i started walkin behind and pinching my arm blabla so he would check on me from times to times or even walk next to me and (L) noticed that and she would grab me and like keep me next to her when she gets the chance anyway and he asked the night before to match outfits together and (L) didn't like that as well which i understand it was wrong to do that 

moving to the day he confessed his love to me it was maybe 2 months after my breakup and we were sitting on the beach and he wrote me a lil paragraph now at first i panicked cuz i was thinking about (L) and (s) reaction to this and that i would ruin the friend group but also I wanted to do confess and tell him that i like him as well so i stayed quiet for a moment and then i told him that it was adorable and i got awkward and didn't know what to say after i decided to not telll him that i liked him cuz it wasn't fair but i ended up saying something dumb I said ""I'm not friend zoning you by doing this"" and he immediately took it as a yes and and at first i didn't notice that cuz as dumb as I am i thought by saying that he won't feel embarrassed or awkward around me but he took it as yes and then he seemed super happy and he started saying 'you're not prankin me right?"" And i felt so bad i was like okay lemme give it a try he's a good guy and my (L) and (s) likes him so why wouldn't they be supportive about it? Besides we can all hangout together and like that no one would feel left out or neglected

 so omw back home i texted them and told them that at beginning i was all happy and giggling on the bus until they started saying mean stuff and i started crying now i didn't wanna push it so I waited until i got home and texted (L) cuz (s) didn't wanna talk to me, and now things will take a twist and i talked to (L) and asked her if she was mad at me she said she was disappointed cuz she would've never done this and that she"" always had eyes on me"" when she said that and some mean stuff i told her that if i go and break up with him would we go back as we used to and (t) included and she agreed so i went on and i told him that we can't be together after it (t) went complaining to her saying that she forced me to do it and cuz tnh i told (L) that i only had a crush on him and it will go away within time and I'm gonna be honest they were mean to (t) as well 

but anyway after it me and him we kept talking and he convinced to give us a chance so i did that and i went to (L) and told her about my decision she got mad and she said some mean stuff as well after it (s) texted me as well saying mean stuff and calling me a pick me and that there was a rule of not dating (t) and when i told her when did we make this rule she said it was common sense anyway there was a lot of tension between us a lot of mean stuff were said to me and also to (t) and i didn't talk to them for a lil moment until stuff calmed a bit and i was crying to (t) about and at one point he asked me to show him what they been saying to me so i shared my screen and he saw what (L) said to me and he said that it was a confession now I did something wrong cuz I wanted to please (L) so i told her that i liked her as well and it was mutual so i understood that i hurt her feelings by doing that and i apologized but i knew it wouldn't be enough to undo the damage

 anyway after we planned to meet and talk about what happened face to face so we did that and (t) confronted (L) about all what she said to him or me stuff like ""thank you for dumping him for me "" and bringing up his past friendships blabla so after it we thought we were fine and we talked it out as adults after it one of (t) friends passed by and she stayed with us and somehow this friend and (L) got along and we thought it was good so i was walking with (t) and (s) while (L) and that friend were behind us we thought it was cute and all then when i got home that friend told (t) she would've done the same thing (L) did and he asked what she tell her and apparently she said a whole other version and didn't mention her confession nor all what she said to me from mean unnecessary stuff so (t) told her all what happened and she was understanding

 after that day i thought things are gonna be as it used to be and i tried staying close with them but i always would end up getting left in school cuz apparently they didn't like (t) anymore and they didn't wanna be around him so yeah i started pulling away as well and i would only hangout with (t) and i was getting disappointed a lot from their side so i lost hope and i was sad about it cuz i was the one who lost everything at the end but i tried focusing on my relationship with (t)

 and after a lil period (L) would text and askin for us to get back together and work on friendship which i end up discussing with (t) cuz he was around when i had no one and i didn't wanna do something to hurt him after all what he did to me anyway we started talkin again me and (L) and (s) as well and in that period there was some tension between me and (t) and tbh he felt threatened by (L) and he was scared i would break up with him again which (L) ended up convincing me to do saying that it shows in my eyes that i don't love him and I'm only hurting him by staying in this relationship so i listened to her and me and (t) broke up but we were on good terms and i promised him that I'm willing to hangout with him just as we used to and i did and 

after few days he was helping me on my pc with quick assist and then i had to leave so i told him that i would let him finish his work cuz i truly trusted him but when i got back i texted and he was so off and apparently he discovered that (L) pushed me to break up with him and he read our conversation and also some stuff i said on chatgpt cuz i used to vent when i had no one and i felt so bad cuz he really didn't deserve that and i realized that i shouldn't have listened to (L) so apologized and told him I'm ready to do whatever he wants as long as it means he will forgive me and we can even get back together and he said he would give our relationship a second chance under one condition which is me never talking to (L) again and as much as it broke i agreed cuz (L) caused so much damage and i wanted to stay with him like stayed with me when i had no one so after it i went to school with my puffy eyes and i told (L) and (s) that I'm back with (t) so it was obvious they weren't happy about it

 (L) left immediately and (s) was just there and the vibes were so off after it i left cuz it was too much anyway after this i told (L) that it would be for the best to keep a distance between us at least until the semester ends ,now obviously (L) and (s) were getting closer each day passes by and that was one of the reasons that made me lose hope of getting things as it used to be

 so anyway after it one time we had class and only me (s) and (L) attended it and (s) she was okay with being friends with both us and it meant a lot to me cuz i didn't wanna lose (s) anyway we finished our class and i got in the car with them and there was another friend there (L) brought with her so we sat there for a bit then (s) had to leave so got out of the car and that friend left as well so i was left with (L) and i told her I'm okay with staying with her until her dad comes pick her up so we were sitting and talking and she told me she's finally okay with me dating (t) and all and she'll always understand me and then (t) appeared out of nowhere and he saw me sitting next her and he seemed super upset so (L) hugged me and left

 and he was there saying that he bought me snacks because i was on my period anyway after it he started crying saying why i can't chose him and if am i in love with him so after it i felt so guilty and told him I'm ready to block her from everywhere and i texted her in front of him and told her with my final decision and i blocked her from everywhere now basically she went on and told (s) about cuz (s) came and ask me about it herself and she said that she's fine being our friend me and(L) even tho we're not talking anymore until the semester ended and (s) texted me saying she can't be my friend anymore so goodbye forever ,did i cry about this for the whole summer? Yes

 and tbh ( t) would try to cheer me up like buying me something i really wanted on my birthday or lil gifts like that and i appreciated that anyway the whole summer was depressing cuz i missed (L) and (s) and i felt like i was forced to leave them while i was still mourning losing them my ex (M) texted me and apparently he figured out that I'm dating (t) rn and he lost it and said a lot of mean stuff to me and to (t) as well i thought it would end up just here but one day one of my high-school friends stalked his acount and she found that him and (L) were following each other which made me puke cuz i said in the beginning these two hated each other

 anyway i texted (M) and apparently he was the one reaching out to her to ask about me and (t) and how we started dating anyway i blocked him after it cuz (t) wasn't comfortable with me talking to him and i respected that anyway (M) opened another public account and he started posting memes or just content that implies how I'm a slut amd stuff like that that's all cuz (L) told him some rumors she made about me

 anyway it was a hard period of time of going through this slut shaming over stuff i didn't even do and also my relationship with (t) was super draining until one day i decided to break up with him cuz i didn't see a point in our relationship our conversations were super shallow and it was obvious he was just attracted to me physically and we just didn't work he did a lot of stuff that drained me or just stuff i wasn't okay with to begin with so when i noticed that this relationship is bad i broke up with him and we were on good terms but we agreed that we won't be texting each other that much like it would be once a month or something , 2 weeks passed after my break (L) reached out to me sayin she wants closure now at first i didn't wanna reply cuz i was pissed that she went behind my back and talked to my ex cuz i would've never done that to her anyway i replied to her and we started talking i explained the whole situation of how (t) found out that she was the one pushing me to break up with him blabla 

and then after we agreed on meeting cuz apparently (s) wanted to talk to me after it she told me my ex(M) wanna text me as well i went on i found his text and he apologized i forgave him cuz i understood from where that hate was coming and i did him dirty , turned out he was dating a new girl as well and (L) already told me about it sayin she's just like me and he was suspicious at first that it was me with a fake acount so yeah after talking to him he said the same thing and he even said that he doesn't have feelings for her and they've been dating for a month but he couldn't forget about me (keep in mind by the moment we were talking it's been already 10 months since we broke up) and he confessed that he still had feelings for me and i told him even if i had feelings for him i won't be able to be with him cuz i don't wanna be home wrecker and he told me that's on him and he shouldn't have gotten himself into a relationship blabla 

anyway i told him that i don't feel comfortable talking to him while he was in a relationship cuz the girl is innocent at the end of the day .

 the after it  he texted me saying he broke up with her and he really did it ,

 i told (L) about this but yeah after it we planned our spot to hangout out and we agreed about when and where ,i went there we met it was okay i felt a bit odd but i truly missed them so ignored that i didn't let pay a penny penny that day i made sure to buy them snacks or whatever they wanted i even bought them some lil gifts anyway we spent the day together and we talked it out and everything okay except some lil things, for example we were walkin and they mentioned some incident happened between me and my ex (M) and it was a girl who insulted me in the most vulgar way and it made me cry my eyes out and i texted my ex about askin him if he knows that girl which turned out he did anyway they said that it was so funny what she said and she was creative, i ignored this one even tho i was on verge of crying when they said this we arrived to a coffee shop we sat there and we started talking a bit and (L) started showing me screenshots of her and (M) talking apparently they started talkin since July and they became like friends lol and she kept showing me screenshots saying he was sayin this and that and tbh he didn't say anything bad except the fact he told about the times where i would complain to him about her anyway i paid for us and then we walked around for a bit and they started telling me how did i accept dating (t) and they were makin jokes about it and they also talk about how they spent the summer together and like rubbing it in my face how they're closer than ever which made me feel like I'm third wheeling but i ignored that feeling 

now it was getting dark and we had to get back home and (s)kinda passed by my bus station when she's on her way home but apparently she wanted to give (L) a ride home which lives on the opposite side , and this didn't bother me cuz it's her car at the end of the day what bothered me is her dropping me in our school location while it's getting dark and she knows i never take the bus from there like she used to drop me in my bus station cuz i take two busses to get home anyway she was like okay get out of the car which i did and i kept crying while walking wondering if there's any busses left at this our and i didn't even have money to take a cab cuz i spent all my money on them .

anyway i managed to get home and i found texts from my ex (M) askin about me and i needed to vent so i told him about everything that happened on that day and how i felt betrayed cuz he went on and told her all these stuff but he ended up showing me what she (L) was saying about me and tbh i collapsed cuz i never thought my best friend would go and talk about me like this to my ex ,she literally lied about everything and she made up so many rumors denying the fact that she's bisexual and saying that she get disgusted by lesbians while at the same time she would come and tell me she's bisexual?

 I was shocked and this is literally 10% of what he showed me so i made up my mind i left her a text sayin to never reach out to me again and i blocked her (L) and (s) from everywhere.

 after a while i decided to give me and (M) another chance and we started dating again now apparently i forgot to block( L) on pintrest and me and (M) had a board there it was like a cute couples stuff basically she texted me on pintrest saying she's disappointed that I'm dating (M) again after all what he said about me but it didn't end here .

 so out of respect i already told (t) that I'm talkin to (M) again and he took it so badly and asked for his stuff back which i was okay with so i gave him back all his gifts, anyway after this (L) texted (t) telling him that i was cheating on him with (M) and she sent him a screenshot of a girl who texted (M) and he thought it was me and also she sent him a screenshot of that pintrest board saying that i never loved him 

I know it's a long story but it really affected my mental health and I'm not saying I didn't make some poor choices i did and i admit it but i wanna know if I'm the ahole for cutting them off?

1p4erbe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4erbe,Day Three Roadtrip donkeys and hot springs,"Last night my friend JD recommended a really good forest campground. It had everything. A creek running right by it, remote, level spots and free. I honestly loved waking up to birds singing everywhere and wild horses walking right next to me. The place was completely empty, just me, Maggie, the birds and those beautiful horses. I couldn’t take a picture because my camera and phone were charging inside the jeep, and I didn’t want to move and spook the horses. Plus I had both hands holding Maggie back so she wouldn’t bark.

After that we headed down the mountain toward State Highway 82. It is a dirt road, but well maintained. I needed fuel and Tonopah was the closest gas station. On the way I stopped in Belmont again and had coffee with JK, who had asked me the day before to stop by on my way out.
He lives in one of the few original houses still standing in this small ghost town. Apparently Belmont is the best preserved ghost town in Nevada, and I believe it. If you’re into this kind of stuff like I am, you need to visit. If you go, say hello to JK at the bar.
Before leaving town I pulled over and took what might be the best picture of the whole trip so far. Snow covered mountains in the back and the jeep posing on the side like it knew what it was doing.

It only took about an hour to get to Tonopah, just enough time to finish the audiobook I’ve been listening to this whole trip, “Gold Bar Bob.” It’s the story of one of the most corrupt government officials we have had in the last 50 years, Bob Menéndez. He is Cuban born like me but that is literally the only thing we have in common. He is finally in jail where he belongs. If you’re into politics, it is a great listen.

After refueling I stopped at this new coffee shop at the end of town. The place used to be a McDonald’s. Now it’s a coffee shop and the breakfast sandwich was great. The extra hot latte hit the spot.

From there I kept going south toward McGruder Mountain, but first I wanted a hot bath. There is a nearby hotspring I have visited before, so I headed that way. To my surprise the place was completely empty, so I took a two hour hot bath while Maggie sat next to me begging to get in. I didn’t let her.
On the way out we ran into a bunch of donkeys, so obviously I stopped to take pictures and videos. I was tempted to let Maggie chase the burros, but yesterday I posted drone shots of wild horses and some people acted like I was committing war crimes. One person even said I was torturing the horses. I wasn’t. The drone was far away, and they didn’t even react. But if I let Maggie chase the burros today I would never hear the end of it, so I behaved. Maggie was very disappointed in me.

At the last minute I decided to head to some nearby sand dunes. I wanted a change of scenery, and wet sand makes climbing the dunes easier.
Tonight I am only about 100 miles from home, sleeping right next to these beautiful dunes under a perfect sky and cool night air. Inside the camper though it is warm, very warm. I am using a diesel heater for the first time ever and I have no idea how I survived this long without one.

If you read all this, thank you. I appreciate you.

1p4er0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1p4er0e/my_boss_is_different_unlike_others_i_guess_i_am/,"My boss is different, unlike others I guess. I am so happy to be working for him and to be part forever ♾️","As an  architectural designer, I started my career parallel to my Bachelor's of Design in university. The one-year design diploma gave me the privilege to join a firm as a part-time intern with 5K a month, working 6–7 hours. There wasn’t any role called “part-time designer” back then.

The same space acted as my studio to work on my university assignments.
So I felt it more like home than my home — where late night hip-hop music with a mug full of coffee and working on sketches was considered sinful in the older part of Hyderabad. And people thought it had no future.

So I preferred staying back at the same place most of the time. I later got promoted to Junior Designer and then left that space as a grown-up man from a teen, with a bit more energy, after working for three years.

Yes, I am grateful about this boss — but he’s not the one I’m talking about.

Later, I moved to a new job with an upgrade in my salary. This time it was in Jubilee Hills. A fancy office where I got my coffee as soon as I entered, colleagues ordering fancy food, formal invitations for weekend parties, and night stays at their place.

I was a bit hesitant — coming from the older part, with responsibilities, and with a hunger to be a great designer like my gurus one day. This dream stopped me from being part of that lifestyle. And my economic bike wasn’t looking great parked beside BMWs and Benzes.

Thank God for this opportunity though — I got exposure to conceptual design, real interior projects, not something like Livespace or Homelane (which also have good designs in their own segment).

My biggest flex was working on a 45-crore residence and a 20-crore commercial space as a lead designer.

No, I’m not talking about this boss either.

New year came with new opportunities. The desperate me, wanting to be part of good designers, ended up in firms where clients weren’t respected, projects were done only for the sake of portfolio and money. Everything was pushed on me because I was the Senior Designer. And each client had the same issue:
“Why can’t we get what we need?”
“Why isn’t your head taking or having meetings with us?”

Slowly I felt I was being used. The toxic culture and office politics were killing the designer in me. A greedy soul was waking up, thinking this is the right way.

Here comes the major step 🪜
I quit — despite getting the best salary, a senior position, and a fancy Volvo office car for site visits (which was way more comfortable and amazing than my humble economic bike).
Yet I decided to quit, leaving two months’ salary behind. I don’t regret it.

Obviously, this boss is not the one I’m talking about, and definitely not the one I am happy about.

So which boss then?

This passionate guy hired me when I had no clue where to go.
The journey started in 2022 as a freelancer with him. After a little confidence and previous experience, he decided to give me more responsibilities with one rule:

No day is off.
Each call is important.
Each client is the first client.
No project is small.
And every penny and second matters.

I was motivated. I felt the same energy as my first part-time job. I decided to take it on despite getting only 25% of the salary I used to get as a senior designer. My parents were definitely not happy — about him and about me.

I started working, and it turned out to be great.
He was there with me each day, each second, whenever I needed.

I was left with my own responsibility, freedom to take decisions, and a creative approach — something none of the firms I worked with since 2016 ever gave me.

He rewarded me with a two-month break. A solo trip to Uttarakhand after working for two years — in 2024. We had great moments, ups and downs, and we celebrated everything together.

This year started slow, yet he was still there, never leaving me alone.

Even though he paid a little less compared to the last two years, I decided not to give up. I stuck with him because he was the reason I could make my parents happy by contributing to the first home we are getting for ourselves — the elder son responsibility, done.

Now I am grateful for the step of quitting and joining him. He didn’t have an office, yet I was happy. I had to manage my lunch outdoors, yet I was comfortable. And my payment was done last, after paying all the team — still I am happy from the bottom of my heart.

Because…

I decided to be with him forever, till the end, whatever happens.

Yes, I can do that — because this boss is me.

I got hired by myself, with a strong belief in me, back in 2022.
Touch wood — happy and prosperous.

I may grow slowly,
I may see less CTC compared to others,
I may have to work on Sundays like today, as I’m writing this from the metro 🚇 going to a site.

But all this fades each night when I see myself living the life I wanted as a designer — the one I manifested back in 2016.

And the best part?
This dude is getting his own studio next year. It’s the biggest gift ever.

To each self-employed soul out there — this little story is for you, specially.
To each individual who supported me and continues to support me — just like u/Fin_Turtle and others — I don’t have words to convey my love.

To those who trust someone like me in any form of work — you’re not just supporting; you are becoming part of their dreams.

Until next time,
May the force be with you all — and with me.
Love ❤️

1p4eqdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1p4eqdo/going_on_first_date/,Going on first date?,"So, my sister convinced me to get on the dating apps (to be fair, the idea of a romantic relationship sounds great, in theory...) im 24F and have never dated anyone at all, never even been on a first date. Im also bi if thats relevant, but it's not as important for this story.

I met a guy on Hinge and we've been chitchatting for like a week, exchanging a few messages a day. The fact that I'm autistic is NOT on my profile, though ive been told by irl friends that its easy to tell lmao. Yesterday, he suggested we meet up for coffee, and while I experienced a lot of anxiety over it (something I think a lot of us can relate to) i said yes because... ive been looking forward to his messages. I dont want to stop talking to him, but... the idea of taking the next step is terrifying. 

We're meeting on Tuesday. Im honestly petrified of how its going to go. Conversation comes easily enough digitally, but I suspect I have a habit of talking too much in real life, particularly when im nervous. My anxiety is also insisting on thinking about when im going to disclose im autistic and, more humiliatingly, that im on my country's financial support and dont work (due to the autism.) 

Ive spoken to my friends about this but they also have very little to no experience dating. I came here hoping to get some wisdom from other autistic women, as I know we find ourselves in a unique position when it comes to relationships of any kind. 

I find myself nervous about doing this first, most of all. Being bi, I was certain most of my firsts (date, kiss, etc) would be with women, as ive historically been more attracted to women then men. Suddenly, theres been a change with this guy, and as we all know, our brains dont love a sudden change, haha. 

Additionally, and I cant describe why, but im experiencing pretty major anxiety over the ""seal"" of this first ""breaking"", the warranty label falling off myself. I dont know why I feel this way. I didnt grow up in a puritan culture, and perhaps this particular anxiety is something best discussed with my therapist, lol. But if this is something anyone else has struggled with, I would love any insight you're willing to give on how to talk yourself out of this spiral.

About a week and a half ago, our HOA announced they want every condo owner to pay an IMMEDIATE $4,000 special assessment per unit AND approve a $3 million loan that would send our monthly dues through the roof. The money is supposedly to replace the antiquated dry fire-retardant attic sprinkler systems in every unit and cover other deferred repairs - repairs they’ve ignored because the HOA is basically bankrupt.

Why bankrupt? Because for years they’ve been paying the local fire marshal $50,000 PER MONTH for “fire watch” on ten of the buildings. Apparently the original builder installed the UNNECESSARY sprinkler system 20 years ago and then went bankrupt himself. So now we’re all stuck with the bill.

And today it got worse. The fire marshal expanded the fire watch to ALL the units and doubled the monthly fee to $100,000! I wish I were joking. On top of that, he’s threatening to condemn the entire complex and evict everyone if the owners don’t approve the assessment and loan on the second vote scheduled for December 3rd. (The owners already voted a pretty enthusiastic “absolutely not” the first time.)

It feels like extortion, plain and simple.

We met with an HOA attorney, but suing our own HOA isn’t exactly a winning strategy. We’ve got an owners’ coffee meeting tomorrow away from the ears of the HOA board to compare notes, panic quietly, and try to figure out whether we have any real options.

Right now, it feels like our only choices are:

 1. Agree to the assessment and loan, even though many owners can’t afford it - especially the federal workers just coming out of a shutdown and everyone heading into the holidays.

 2. Refuse, and risk losing our homes.

 3. Move. We own and rent out a house in the same city. We could pay the $4,000 extortion…I mean ‘assessment’ and sell the condo in January or February and request a rent back until the current tenants’ lease is up in April.

I’ve contacted a handful of local news outlets to see if anyone will look into what’s going on, because something here does not smell right. Between the fire marshal’s behavior and the extremely valuable land our condos sit on, I can’t shake the feeling that someone, somewhere, stands to profit if our buildings disappear.",4,1763875964.0,HOA,2,0.83,False

TLDR : My (24M) female best friend (25F) of over 10 years is set to have a dream arranged marriage in February to a genuinely great, mature guy who I’ve met and really like. Yesterday, she confessed that she wants ""closure"" from her past partners (around 15-17 guys) before the wedding, and when I asked for clarification, she explicitly confirmed she means sleeping with them one last time to ""have fun"" before her new life begins. When I questioned the risk, she dismissed it, saying the groom will never find out because neither she nor I will tell him. The ring ceremony is in the second week of December, and I am currently in shock, feeling terrible for the groom, and questioning whether I should intervene or stay out of it, as this has completely ruined my view on marriage.

Hey guys, this is gonna be very awkward or maybe normal and I'm new to this? Idk but okay here's what's going on:

My (24M) female best friend (25)  is getting married in February, it's a dream destination wedding and I'm really excited cause we used to speak about how her wedding is gonna be and now it's happening!!! The guy is very calm, mature, well paying job, rarely drinks, doesn't smoke. I've met him a few times and we vibed on movies and Fifa really well! Even my friend has a well paying job and she is excited about the power couple image. This is an arranged marriage for context.

Now, our friendship has crossed over 10 years and I know every minute detail about her life. Her first bf, her first kiss, and even when she lost her virginity cause we are crazy close to each other and just share things (not in details of course).

Now, this friend, let's call her D has had multiple partners in relationships, situationships, flings etc. A rough count will be around 15-17 that I know of.

Yesterday, I was just talking to her about the travel plans and all cause we are planning to take a trip with our childhood friends before the wedding. She told me she wants a 'closure' from all the guys before she steps into her new life and my mind went 'WHHHAAATTTTT???'. Then I thought I'm misinterpreting and overreacting and so I clarified her with 'Closure means a coffee date closure, right?' and she said 'Nahiiii, I mean a last time together closure so I can have fun for the last time before beginning my new life'

My mind went numb, thoughtless, I didn't know what to speak!! The guy she is marrying is genuine amazing, good height, decent build, chill in nature, their family also seems pretty forward from what I've heard...

I don't kmow what to say or do, is this right? Does everyone do it? Am I just overreacting?

They are yet to exchange rings, should I tell him? The ring exchange ceremony is in 2nd week of December.

I tried telling her 'Are you sure? It might ruin your wedding if he comes to know, do you really want it?'

She said 'Dekh bhai, tu toh batayega nahi usse, nor am I gonna say anything, itne saalon mein mummy papa ko nahi pata chala, how'd he figure it?'

I just changed the conversation as it was too much load on my mind... But this thought has been disturbing me, what to do? Also this conversation has ruined my trust on marriage, I don't wanna get married now, this is too fu*ked up and I ain't ready for this, might as well stay single and happy


UPDATE - I didn't know the post would blast, well I'm going to spill it to the guy and break my friendship. I'll update once I've done it

UPDATE 2 - I went and spoke to her very strictly about this, also got some proof to prove my point, she took it as a joke till I changed my tone. She shouted at me for the most times saying why am I doing this, I explained to her my point. Then she started 'Bro, I was just kidding'. I respectfully asked her to part ways as friends with me as my consciousness doesn't allow this. She obeyed my decision, I blocked her on socials, she thinks the storm has oassed but honestly, I want to inform the guy. I'll be doing it tomorrow if he agrees to meet me. Thank you for your support. I'll be back with another update which potentially will be the last one. Thank you. God Bless.",12,1763875688.0,TeenIndia,39,0.8,False

1p4ekjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hernia/comments/1p4ekjd/fast_recovery_surgery_in_korea/,Fast Recovery - Surgery in Korea,"I just got a no-mesh tissue surgery in Korea (Gibbeum Hospital, Dr Kang) and wanted to share my positive experience just to spread some hope and positivism.

34M, suffered from a right sided indirect inguinal hernia about 1.5 years ago. I believe I had both hernias since I was born, I got a history of family members suffering from these. I first noticed a small lump when I was like 13 (yeah, more than 20 years ago). I lived with that one for 20 years, lifting heavy, playing rugby, contact sports etc no problem. When I was 33 the hernia grew and started to be painful, so i decided to get it fixed. My advice for really young patients (under 20) is to GET it fixed as soon as possible with a super minimal technique tailored for indirect hernias.

Why? Well, recent studies coming from Korea show that even simple ligation of the indirect hernia sac have low rates of recurrence in young patients, as the underlying issue in these hernias is a patent processus vaginalis (or basically the deep inguinal ring not having closed completely or properly). This means that fixing this defect usually gives a good result as tissues are strong and the ability of the body to properly heal the ""repair"" is good.

My first hernia was fixed in Germany using a hybrid Desarda technique (herniotomy + repair of the deep inguinal ring + Desarda flap to reinforce the posterior wall). The result was really good, I was back at the gym 3 weeks post surgery, lifting heavy 4 weeks post surgery and back to my presurgery strength and muscle mass around 6-8 weeks post surgery. Didn't have any issue or pain since like day 4-5. However, I did notice this repair is a bit overkill for this kind of hernia, the first few days I suffered excruciating pain (I had other open surgeries before and this was the worst by far), it took me 2 weeks to walk up completely straight and mobility / tightness was an issue also for a few weeks.

I was in Indonesia when I suddenly noticed a lump in the left side (I was like ""oh fuk no, not this again""). I had already done my research and knew a more minimal, tailored approach (like Dr Kang, which I believe is currently the best) was better, so went ahead and booked my surgery in Gibbeum Hospital, I got appointed for surgery in 10-11 days.

Traveled alone to S. Korea, met Dr Kang for the pre-surgery appointment. He was really friendly, down to earth and knowledgeable, he answered all my questions in fluent english and I asked him about his technique as, as an engineer, I find surgical techniques quite interesting. Did some tests (ultrasound, blood test etc) and went back to the hotel.

The next day I arrived to the hospital (which btw is extremely clean, efficient and welcoming, which I appreciated coming alone) for surgery at 8am. Checked in and waited around 2h for surgery as I was one of the youngest I believe. Surgery was easy and painless, Dr Kang uses local anesthesia only + light sedation. I talked to the team of surgeons and assistants throughout the surgery, Dr Kang fixed the hernia and performed his reconstruction technique in literally 15' and I went back to my room. The whole procedure took maybe 20-30' (crazy).

POST SURGERY, 1-12h:

I rested in bed, I knew the anesthetics would wear off in 2-4h and I was expecting the crazy EXCRUCIATING pain I remembered from my first surgery. To my surprise, 4h post surgery I did notice some pain but tbh I was perfectly fine, maybe a 2-3/10 pain, all in all considering I had no painkillers after the surgery. Dr Kang visited me in my room and I told him ""I'm surprised I feel so well after an open surgery"" and he laughed. They asked me if I needed some pain relief but I chose not to have any because I was curious to see if the pain would get worse. To my surprise, the pain actually started to decrease even more and I fell asleep without any painkiller for like 2-3h. I woke up and it was already getting dark, ate dinner, did some phone calls and some work on my laptop with minimal pain. I asked for some painkillers just so I could sleep like a baby, but honestly I didnt even need them.

I woke up at night and had to go to the bathroom. Well, I knew this was gonna hurt (expected LMAO). Of course the painkiller was already wearing off and it took me like 10' to get out of bed lol It hurt like a B1tch, but this is expected 12h post surgery with painkillers wearing off, but it hurt NOTHING compared to my first surgery. Also, holding my balls up helped with the pain so much when standing, I feel like the balls pulling down stresses the repair as there is some dissection done around the spermatic cord, so it makes sense that supporting your ballsac helps with pain. In the end I managed to pee and go back to bed and the second time I had to go it was even easier and much less painful. Remember this is like 12-14h post surgery with the only dose of painkiller probably having worn off already.

POST SURGERY 12-24h:

Every single hour from now on I felt even better. I had no more painkillers from now on (I got them offered but I wanted to see how I felt). The morning after surgery I was already feeling great, no pain when in bed (shocking), and minimal pain / tightness when walking and getting out of bed (remember holding your ballsack). I ate early lunch, had a nap and got discharged, now comes the crazy part. I felt so good that I didn't even take a taxi back to my hotel, I got dressed and walked 20' back to my hotel with my backpack, remember I had the painkiller the day prior. I had some kind of ""compression"" or tight boxer underwear which helped keeping my balls up tight... I was in shock with how well I was feeling tbh, I did walk slowly and carefully but with zero pain, only minimal discomfort and tightness.

POST SURGERY, day 2:

I arrived in my hotel, left my stuff and went out for dinner (LOL). I then came back and slept like a baby. In the begining getting in and out of bed was a bit challenging, but maybe 5x easier than how it was even 5 days post op in my first surgery. The summary of the next day was sleeping like a bear (I slept maybe 8h at night, and 8h during the day), walking around the block to go buy some food and stretch my legs and working on my laptop. Getting in and out of bed got surprisingly easy already 2 days post op, mostly 1/10 pain when having to get out or sit down.

POST SURGERY, day 3:

Same as day 2, trying to eat enough protein and carbs, eat a lot and rest. I started to walk more though, I walked around 1h (30' back and forth to grab a coffee), and another hour in the afternoon. I'd say I did easily 8k steps with 0 discomfort, which for 3 days post surgery is crazy. Minimal swelling and discomfort, pain pretty much 0. Also had a long shower which felt great.

POST SURGERY, day 4:

I walked around 3+ hours today, more mobile, no tightness or discomfort. I went to visit the city center in Seoul, did some work in a few coffee shops. Overall feeling pretty much back to normal (crazy).

# 1. Community Glow-Up (Forum + Sharing Vibes)

* Rolled out a robust forum with categories, threads, and threaded replies – perfect for Q&A on everything from React hooks to algorithm puzzles.
* Added a **Top Contributors Leaderboard** that ranks users by post activity, upvotes, and helpfulness (e.g., most replies, likes received, or solutions marked).
* Users can now **create, share, and fork code snippets** – think GitHub Gists but baked right into the app, with mini-projects anyone can remix and build on.

# 2. Project Collaboration Magic

* **Forking for All**: Grab any project milestone or snippet, tweak it, and push your version live.
* **Peer Review System**: Submit projects for feedback from the community – get ratings, comments, and suggestions on a dedicated Reviews page.
* Built-in **Version Control**: Simple history tracking in the project editor, so you can rollback changes or see what your collab partner tweaked.

# 3. Mentorship Program Launch

* Experienced users can **register as mentors** with a quick profile setup.
* Learners request guidance on specific projects/topics via a streamlined form.
* Mentors get a dashboard to review submissions (projects or snippets), drop detailed feedback, and assign ratings – turning knowledge-sharing into a structured program.

Fixed a few import gremlins and typos along the way, but it's all live now! The app's feeling more like a vibrant Discord-for-coders than ever. Total tools used: \~24 files edited/written, zero coffee refills needed (yet).

What do you think – would *you* use a mentorship request button mid-project? Any must-have tweaks for the leaderboard? Or wild ideas for v2? Drop 'em below – feedback fuels the build!",1,1763875413.0,LuauAcademy,0,1.0,False

I woke before the sunrise on our fifth anniversary, my heart fluttering with anticipation. For months, I'd been secretly working on Vincenzo's gift—a portrait capturing our happiest memories together. The morning light filtered through our bedroom curtains as I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake him.

In the kitchen, I prepared his favorite breakfast: eggs benedict with freshly squeezed orange juice and the aromatic Italian coffee he loved so much. The table was set with our wedding china, a small vase of red roses at the center. Everything had to be perfect today.

I heard his footsteps on the stairs and smoothed down my silk robe, suddenly feeling nervous. Five years of marriage, and still my heart raced when he entered a room.

""Happy anniversary,"" I said, my voice soft with affection as he appeared in the doorway.

Vincenzo stood there in his tailored suit, already dressed for work. His dark hair was perfectly styled, not a strand out of place. But something in his expression made my smile falter—a coldness I'd been noticing more frequently these past months.

""I have something for you,"" he said, his voice devoid of the warmth I craved.

My fingers instinctively went to my wedding ring, twisting it as I often did when anxious. ""I have something for you too. But let's eat first while it's hot.""

""This can't wait."" He placed a manila envelope on the table, pushing aside the roses I'd arranged so carefully.

""What's this?"" I asked, though something in me already knew—a premonition settling like ice in my stomach.

""Your anniversary gift."" His lips curled into what might have been a smile on anyone else. ""Divorce papers.""

The world seemed to tilt beneath me. ""Is this some kind of joke?""

""I've never been more serious, Maria."" He loosened his tie slightly. ""I want a divorce so I can have a proper seven-day romance with Kaiya Bell.""

Kaiya Bell. His new intern. Twenty-three years old with honey-blonde hair and eyes that widened with practiced innocence whenever he entered the room. I'd seen her at the company Christmas party, hanging on his every word.

""Seven days?"" I repeated, my voice sounding distant to my own ears.

""Yes. Seven days to experience what real passion feels like again."" He checked his watch. ""I've invited her for dinner tonight. I expect you to be civil.""

I stared at the breakfast I'd prepared with such care, now growing cold between us. ""You want me to host dinner for your mistress? In our home?""

""Our home for now,"" he corrected. ""And yes. It's the least you could do to make this transition smooth.""

The least I could do. As if I owed him this final humiliation.

That evening, I found myself setting the dining table for three, my movements mechanical. The doorbell rang, and Vincenzo rushed to answer it with an eagerness I hadn't seen directed at me in years.

Kaiya floated in wearing a white dress that screamed false innocence, her perfume filling our home like an invasive species. She kissed Vincenzo full on the lips before turning to me with a saccharine smile.

""Maria! Thank you so much for having me."" She handed me a bottle of cheap wine. ""Vincenzo says you're being so understanding about everything.""

Dinner was an exercise in torture. I watched as Kaiya fed Vincenzo from her fork, giggling at his every word while I pushed food around my plate. Our dog Max circled the table, sensing the tension.

""Oh, what a darling puppy!"" Kaiya cooed, beckoning Max to her. She scratched behind his ears, then glanced at me with calculated innocence. ""Maria, may I see your wedding ring? Vincenzo told me it's quite special.""

Before I could respond, Vincenzo answered, ""Of course she doesn't mind.""

Reluctantly, I slipped off my ring—the platinum band with tiny diamonds that Vincenzo had placed on my finger five years ago, promising forever. Kaiya examined it with exaggerated interest before suddenly slipping it onto Max's collar.",1,1763875278.0,ShadowSlave,1,1.0,False
1p4ehzk,https://i.redd.it/xlhgeodryx2g1.jpeg,I MADE MY NOVEMBER CAPSULE 🍂,"Ok, well, I made it on Halloween but now YOU can see it too (:< 

Ahhh November. I’ve known you were coming for my ass since I started this project in January. 

November is not an easy month for me. I lost two grandparents last year, and the second was in November. And it hit me like a box of rocks, y’all. So I put my head between my knees and white-knuckled it through the big anniversary dates, and BOOM now it’s time for the latiest of my capsules this year. 

I wanted something that felt unearthly for this month, so I decided on a capsule based around my favorite **MOON GODDESS PERFUMES** to pump some air back in my chest & light back in the darkness. It has worked, maybe? But I also wanted a few foils to the Galadriel vibes, so I included 3 non-moon-goddess ‘fumes to reach for when I wanted dirt under my nails. 

**d.grayi — Wednesday’s Nevermore** *(Black Coffee, Paint, Yautli Tincture, Indolic Florals, Candlelight, Woods, Black Copal, Ambrette, Oakmoss)* Starting off with my not-moon-goddess picks. Yauhtli (tagetes lucida) is a marigold I’ve not come across in perfume before! An absolute treat. Gifted by a lovely friend. This has LOTS of marigold, not much coffee or ambrette? I like it! I have no good words to describe it though!!


**Nocturne Alchemy — Keera** *(Sweet Red Sandalwood, Smoked Sandalwood, Galbanum, Sandalwood Chips, Burning Embers and Santalum Absolute)* NOT a moon goddess scent, but a foil. Smoked sandalwood GALORE. Heavy, thumpy, bold. 


**Nocturne Alchemy — Mallow Camel** *(Eggnog Accord, Rum Accord, Nutmeg, Nag Champa Incense Accord, Vanilla Marshmallow accord, Mallow accord, Vanilla Bean, Studio Limited Originals Crystalline Absolute (Vanilla Musk), and Vanilla Crème Accord)* my final not-moon-goddess! yum. look I took one sneef of this last year & went “bleaugh, this has GOT to rest” and boy o boy was resting a great idea. This is NAG CHAMPA vanilla & eggnog. Emphasis on the nag champa! If you want to smell like snuggly sweet holidays AND incense, Mallow Camel is your friend. I’ve worn the heck outta this one this month. 


**MOON GODDESS TIME!!**


**Nocturne Alchemy — Iris Musk** *(Orris Butter, Iris Pallida Root, Iris Accord, Violet Accord, Bastet’s Amber, Bastet’s Musk Absolute)* This moon goddess dances between the makeup compact and the night air, *just* floaty enough to avoid being caught in the compact and shut up in a purse. 


**Nocturne Alchemy — Royal Sandalwood Musk** *(Egyptian Musk, Sweet Musk, Bastet's Musk, Snow Musk Accord, Himalayan Cedarwood, Vanilla Fleck, Amyris, Myrrh, Balsam of Peru, Fir Balsam, Sandalwood Absolute, Australian Sandalwood, Indian Sandalwood Absolute aged in a Bourbon and Oakwood barrel, and Irish Moss)* Actual daydreams. I love this perfume. Ethereal as HECC. Heady moonlit silver and white. Angelic. When I put this perfume on, my feet no longer touch the ground. Magical. Glorious enough it’s made it into its second capsule of the year. 


**Nocturne Alchemy — Bastet’s Amber Original** *(Amber Resin imported from Alexandria and lit from the truest essential oil of Rare and Exotic Guaiac wood and Crystal Benzoin and Crystal Frankincense)* Shimmery, gold-tinged, low-horizon moonlight where the moon looks disproportionately massive. A touch of twinkly starlight dances with this moon goddess. 


**BPAL — Zorya P.** *(Pale amber and ambergris, gossamer vanilla, moonflower, and white tobacco petals)* creamy vanillic ambergris-waxed moonlight. This moon goddess embodies the light, is at peace in her solitude. The sweetest of my picks, this is another one that is making its second capsule appearance this year. 


**BPAL — Faster Kittycat** *(A sudden sophistication: a sheer white chypre with cashmere amber, orris butter, and patchouli)* the warmest moonlight in the bunch, this moon goddess has peeked in a warm window in winter, dusting her light across a sleeping pet’s fur, a quilted bedspread.


**Haute Macabre x BPAL — Esbat** *(a ragged canopy of moonflower and morning glory, dew-touched mosses creeping over gnarled oak roots, and shimmering beams of mugwort, cuckoo flower, and rose mallow)* my first my darlingest my moonest. Compliment-gatherer. The mugwort and moonflower are meant for each other, and I for them. Silvery-green leaves, a glint of moonlight winking off gathering dew. I will forever be devastated this one was discontinued, but if the vibes of this one sound nice to you, Hagroot’s **Moon Flower** is a suitable substitute!


**Alkemia — The Traveler & The Moon** *(Silver leaf tea brewed in an iron kettle, galbanum, sandalwood, petitgrain, tobacco and bamboo leaves, wild currants, raw honey, fresh hay, and a cool splash of rice wine)* threatens to be too grounded, too liquid, the least ethereal but lord it NAILS the colors. Palest green, palest blue, and a skiff of ivory. a fallen moon goddess, who walks  barefoot on dewy ground.


**Maison Anthony Marmin — Habibi I Cannot Come To Dubai, I Am Gay** *(Caramel, Sweet Floral, Vanilla, Creamy White Musk, Indonesian Oud, Ambrette)* Okay CLEARLY that’s not its real name but it’s what I call it because, well, it tru. **Habibi I Cannot Come To Dubai I Am Gay** is way less sweet than the notes would suggest—a musky floaty sophisticated worldly moon goddess. a moon goddess who knows what money is and has enough to spare. I got this many many many moons ago as a gift with purchase and it’s THE one from that order I regularly reach for. 


Anyway. HOW ARE YALL SURVIVING NOVEMBER. I have been living for everyone’s capsules! So many capsule posts!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹 but if you didn’t make a post or just wanna share, tell me: what is your capsule like this month?

Once in a while, she gives me the silent treatment and I always have to guess what I did wrong. I only ever know when we're okay again and she tells me. 

This has been going on for years that fortunately, I know now the reasons for the silent treatments.

This time, it was about how I slept the whole morning and that I didn't eat lunch to sleep more. Flashback to the last few days, she's been asking me to have coffee with her. We drink coffee at 4 pm, then randomly at night, around 10 pm to 12 am. Now, this would fuck with my sleep schedule but I kept having coffee with her cause for it was like a type of bond between us. 

I slept later than usual (like 8 am) because I really couldn't sleep. They woke me up for lunch, I said I didnt wanna eat, and I slept more. Dinner came and that's when I knew I was gonna get another silent treatment.

  
It's just so draining to have her around when she's like this. A lot of times, the things she give me silent treatment for, she also does. Sometimes I feel like she makes rules but doesn't apply it to herself. She likes portraying herself as the logical one, and I always looked up to her. But going around talking about our backs to others (talking about my brother to me and my mom, talking about my mom/dad to me and my brother, obviously would be talking about me to me mom or my brother), I don't think that's logical.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

She sometimes posts videos of how she is being gangstalked and mainly is afraid to eat any food. She says she can’t eat food from the grocery store because “they” are poisoning it, yet she spends exorbitant amounts of money to take Ubers to buy takeout food, have people taste the food in front of her, bring it back home, and then refuses to eat it usually because she still thinks it’s tampered with. 

Also, I’m not sure if she has an undiagnosed eating disorder as well and is using the “food tampering” as a way to avoid actually eating solid foods (she says she has an aversion to them because it’s easier for solid foods to be tampered with). She sometimes reveals her disgust with heavy people, and is obsessed with looking like a doll. So sometimes I think she might be suffering from anorexia as well due to the fact that she only will consume things like coffee and chocolate milk and not actual food (she showed her fridge and all it has is coffee and chocolate milk).  

She obviously needs to see a doctor but her only close support, her father, died of cancer recently, but she keeps telling everyone that her dad is actually in the witness protection program due to her gangstalker and the whole death was staged at the hospital. 

This has been extremely upsetting watching her and I feel so bad for her but don’t know how to help her out, if at all. I know the only thing that might help her out right now is a doctor and some medication, but how on earth is she ever going to get to that point if she is so isolated and thinks that everyone who is trying to help her is out to harm her?

I was able to afford to see a naturopathic doctor and a nutritionist in my area and a stool test showed I had a parasite as well as leaky gut.

I was put on Biocidin for a bit to kill off the parasite, retested and it was gone.

My skin was still suffering, so I started drinking bone broth every morning before coffee or breakfast and within 6 months, my cysts were totally gone! I luckily reintroduced all the foods I had cut out and was able to tolerate them.

Fast forward to now: I’m studying nutrition therapy and my skin has been pretty manageable other than hormonal breakouts around my period. I’m able to eat any and all foods.

A few weeks ago, I started to have loose stools again, basically diarrhea everyday. My skin has continued to break out past my period and I essentially can’t keep any nutrients down. Every morning, I have diarrhea or very loose stool (lots of undigested food in it).

I can’t afford to return to this doctor and I know I’m presenting some leaky gut symptoms again but I still drink bone broth every morning and eat a wide variety of foods. I’m not sure if I should do a round of Biocidin again myself to see if that helps?

I will say, a few weeks ago I had some stressful news compounded with other stress in life but those things have resolved and I wonder if thats what set it off?

I’d appreciate any and all insights!

Anyway, purchased a new hose and connected it to the one that came with the van (needed the length) and both are new, the one that came with it clearly hadn’t been used and mine was delivered today.

Bonehad move: I didn’t run any water though the hoses first. Duh. Filled the tank to flush it. Everything seemed fine. emptied it and then filled it again, after putting water in it, I noticed something that looked like a coffee bean laying under the fill connection. Looked and there were three more in the hole where you connect the hose. One had ‘broken’ and it was like a shell and had some dark stuff in it that the screen seemed to catch.

Two questions:

1. How do I remove that screen (or tell me exactly what it’s called so I can look it up)?
2. Anyone know what it might be and if it’s safe?

**I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move on.**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/dtgE4pifNK)  **Aug 11, 2020**

I’ve suspected things had been going on for a while, but kept brushing it off—I thought he would never do that to me. Since around April, he’s been refusing my attempts to have sex most of the time, sitting differently on the couch to where he’s facing away from me... little things. 

It’s with one of our good friends. She came to my house a few weeks ago. She’s texted me. She’s pretended to be there for me. 

I found out because I rolled over and they were having a Snapchat conversation. She said she wished she could be there to hold him and he summarized that I tried to seduce him last night and mocked it. I confronted him and he admitted it. He said that it was because quarantine was stressful. He does not want to work things out. He thinks of me “only as a friend in his heart.”

When I told her husband, he confronted her and apparently they actually kissed back in February. I think at that moment, I was never going to be enough for him. 

We used to be so so so happy. The week before they kissed, we celebrated Valentine’s Day together. He bought us a nice bottle of wine for our anniversary. We had fun, we were perfect. 

I don’t know where to go from here. We’ve been married only about a year. I feel like he took so much from me and doesn’t even want to go to therapy or work this out. I don’t want to leave my house but everywhere in it I see him. He chose her. I’ve been cheated in every relationship I’ve ever been in. He was supposed to be my forever. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve made therapy appointments but I was also laid off last month, so I have too much free time to analyze every single moment where he might have been lying to me or where I made myself pathetic trying to cling to him. 

How do I start to get through this?

TLDR; My husband had an affair and does not want to try to work out our marriage. I feel like I’m drowning and don’t know how to start moving on.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Fx3hgRZN6x)  **Jan 4, 2021 (5 months later)**

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better. 

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them. 

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing. 

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle. 

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything. 

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more. 

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/X5Po5cvN0m)  **Nov 16, 2025 (over 5 years since the OG post)**

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health. 

**FINAL COMMENTS**

**corfiz74**

>Just read your other posts - JFC, what a tool he was! If you don't mind, what did you figure out was the reason you put up with him? What did your therapist say?

**OOP**

>> A lot of it was I equated success with going through the steps of life. Getting married was just the next step and I didn’t think I could find something else. So I settled. 
>>
>> Therapy also helped me realize the reason I kept wanting to put off having kids later and later, it’s because I actually didn’t want them, it’s just what I thought I “should” do. 
>>
>> The things he did became so normal that I just kinda started to accept them. I took on all the emotional labor. I drove two hours a day for my job (as the breadwinner!) because he didn’t want to commute or leave the town he grew up in. I made sure we saw his family for things when I found out that he would use me as an excuse to get out of stuff. Looking back, it’s so obvious but when you’re in that situation, you kinda lose yourself in it.

**FlynnJM**

>Good for you! Sounds like he has regrets.

**OOP** 

>>I do think he regrets how he did it but this was the girl I was always told not to worry about and he had feelings for her for a while. I’m sure he’s probably happy but I think he’s the type of person who’s also content with a mediocre life.

1p4e37j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p4e37j/project_insomnia/,Project Insomnia,"Ever find yourself jobless, angry and fed up? If not, I envy your life. 

Unfortunately, that’s the state I find myself in. 

Worked at a grocery store for about a decade, customer decided to get rough with one of the other employees over some god-damned baby formula. One punch later, they’re getting a couple hundred dollars in gift certificates not to sue, and I’m out the door. 

I’d say ‘ funny how life works’ but there’s nothing funny about my situation. 

So here I sit, combing through reddit for some horror to take my mind off my impending financial doom. Watching 80’s slasher films when that gets old, and re reading my Stephen King collection of course. 

It'd be a good life if I wasn’t sneaking ever closer to starvation. 

One day though, I get a chat request. I accept it, and see a phone number. 

My first thought is that it’s for some kind of ARG. So wallowing in shame, worry and boredom, I give it a call. 

“Thank you for calling project insomnia, how may I direct your call?”, an upbeat female voice says. 

“Got sent this number on Reddit, wondering what everything is about.”, I reply. 

“Good for you! I’ll connect your call.”, the voice replies. 

After a few minutes of hold music that’s exactly as you’d expect, someone answers. 

“Nathan, glad you decided to call. I’ve heard you’re looking for employment and enjoy horror, am I correct?”, a professional sounding man says. 

I’m a little weirded out. I’m not the type to use my name ( of course that isn’t my name, but a stand in, but I’m sure you all know that.) online much. And I certainly haven’t been posting about my financial state ( till this anyway.).

But, people who run ARGs can get really into the weeds, so I don’t think much of it. 

“Right on both accounts, why?”, I reply. 

“We have an opportunity for you. Two weeks of your time, using your skills, 20K.”, the voice says simply. 

“God, I could use that money in real life. But hey, this will keep my mind off of things while I wait for some answers on resumes. Sign me up.”, I answer. 

“Nathan, I think you’re misunderstanding. We’re not running any kind of game. I’m offering you money for your time.”, The voice sounds mildly annoyed. 

“…Really? I’ll bite, what’s the catch? Is this some kind of MLM, pyramid scheme, what’s going on?”, I ask. 

“Details can be given in person. I’ll send you a location, we can meet and see if you feel the job is a good fit. 

I’d request you bring a suitcase in case you feel like taking us up on our offer. There are many other people who have been chosen, and time is a factor.”, the voice explains. 

I get some mild BS vibes from his statements, but it’s not like I have a full schedule. 

A couple of days later, I find myself in a small diner a couple of towns over, sitting with a man in a plain black suit. 

He doesn’t seem nervous, but there’s a vigilance in his eyes. Like he’s used to watching out for things.

 “Glad to see you’ve made it. You wouldn’t believe how hard it is to get people to believe we’re paying 20 grand.”, The man in front of me says. 

“I would, I’m waiting for the part where you tell me it’s split up over a decade and requires a 5k deposit. 

Before that, could I know who I’m talking to?”, I ask. 

“You can call me Adrien.  And I assure you, what I’m offering is real. By the end of this meeting, if you so choose, I’ll have the money in your account.”, is Adrien’s reply. 

There’s some silence, a waitress comes over. 

“Anything I can get for you two?”, the middle-aged lady asks. 

“Coffee for myself, and a clubhouse sandwich with fries for my friend.”, Adrien replies. 

I’m not shocked that he knew what I’d order, more amused. Whoever these people are, they’ve dug into me. 

“You’re trying really hard to cultivate a mysterious aura. It’s working though, so what’s the job?”, I say. 

“Simple really, we want you to watch horror. Lots of it, for extended periods of time, and give your observations.”, Adrien says. 

“Is this some kind of AI training shit? I’m not that desperate.”, I reply. 

“No, Nathan, you will be watching real people. Nothing artificial about it. 

But I know the question you’re really asking. Why are we offering you so much money for something you do every day while you hope to get a call back from the sanitation office or a McDonald’s. 

The answer is not going to be as exciting as you think. 

Your accommodations are going to be rather spartan. Somewhere between a small apartment and a prison cell. We need secrecy and a high volume of participants, hence the arrangement.”, Adrien explains. 

My food comes, I feel like I’m under a microscope as I eat. Adrien’s eyes dissecting my every movement. 

“So this is some kind of test run I’m guessing? Halloween themed attraction at an amusement park?  You’re paying for me to shut up about it more than anything.”, I question. 

Adrien gives a half-shrug. 

“Close enough for government work. 

So, what’s the verdict? I’ve got two more people I have to see tonight.”, Adrien offers sliding over a small stack of papers and a pen. 

I read through the contract, smirking a little, “This is some Mckaney manner stuff here Ade. Like this part about ‘consenting to methods of encouragement that may lead to physical harm’, you can’t sign away your rights against assault. So clearly you guys aren’t going to be knocking out anyone’s teeth.”

Adrien smiles, “No one in organization has any intent to put hands on you. 

Astute observation though.”

“If you want my opinion? Remove those parts, just let people imagine what bad things could happen. 

But all the real bits seem in order. 

So, what about my money?”, I ask. 

The grin Adrien gives me should have been my warning sign. But I was too busy getting a notification of 20 thousand dollars in my nearly empty bank account. 





“Jesus Murphy, you weren’t kidding were you? It’s like someone tried to turn a submarine brig into a bachelor pad.”, I say looking around the small room. 

There’s a bed with thin sheets, a large desk with a few dozen monitors, and that’s about it. Enough room to maybe do some push-ups, but nothing more. 

One thing I notice right off of the bat is how the monitors are constructed. 

Thick, textured plastic leads to the wall, locking each of them in place. They’re hardwired into the electrical system, the plugs being reinforced and grounded behind the wall. 

There’s a small vent in the ceiling doing it’s damndest to minimize the musty odor of the place. 

The toilet is what I’d expect, stainless steel and industrial. But at least it’s clean. 

The door gives me pause. Thick, steel, and with a slot in the middle. 

“If the project takes off, maybe we will look into making the workspaces more comfortable.”, Adrien offers. 

“Not like you could make it any less so. 

But hey, 20k makes it seem a lot bigger than it is, am I right?”, I reply. 

 “Meals are served three times a day, we’ve not found any dietary restrictions in our research on you, but if you have any, feel free to let us know. 

You may keep your cellular device, but usage in most cases will be seen as contrary to the rules outlined in the contract. 

Once daily you will be expected to give a report on what you’re seeing on the monitors. Attention to detail is key.”, Adrien explains. 

“Okay, so this is kind of like a ,Night Trap meets escape room situation?”, I say, sitting down in a small computer chair looking at the bank of various monitors. 

“There’s that attention to detail we’re looking for. 

Watch the monitors Nathan.”, Adrien says, closing the steel door.

Want to know what I’m feeling? Joy.

 Yeah, everything is grimy and eerie as hell, but it’s supposed to be. I’m Alpha testing something or other, an immersive horror game maybe. 

I light up a cigarette and immediately notice two things. 

The first is that all of the monitors are showing three different places. About a half dozen screens a piece, give or take. 

The second is just how varied these screens are. Some are crystal clear, some are antiques, but all are behind a layer of almost imperceptible bulletproof glass. 

How do I know it’s bulletproof glass? I don’t, but it’s clear, I can’t scratch it, and I can’t leave a scorch mark on it. 

Most of the monitors are dull, a fast food place, a gas station and the inside of a house. 

After a while though, someone comes home. A nice looking lady, early thirties or so, smartly dressed and coming home late at night. 

I’ve been watching paint dry for hours, I’m instantly drawn to anything resembling action. 

“What the hell am I doing here?”, I say, frustrated as I watch her through an impeccable screen. 

The house is dark, her kitchen lights obscure the background. Shadows play like feral cats in her Mcmansion. 

I yawn, wondering when dinner is, or for that matter what time it is. 

Then I see it, on one of the older monitors. Could just be glitches from the ancient tech, but I swear it’s a pair of eyes. 

Subtle, well done, it makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 

But as quickly as they appear, they’re gone. 

The woman turns, looking to where the apparition once was. As she does her fridge door closes. Whether of it’s own accord, or something else is unclear. 

“Nice.”, I say, complimenting the scare. Theatre or no, my heart’s racing. 

Boring hours flow by like water in a dangerous lake. I’m brought something they assure me is dinner. Meatloaf, heavy on the loaf, nearly green, green beans and cornbread I debate on keeping to whittle. 

At least the coffee is decent, and given to me in a two litre carafe. 

I look away when the woman starts changing. I’m starting to think this is live improv, and meeting someone after I’ve seen them naked, seems gross. 

One lamp on a desk lights her as she places modest jewelry in expensive cases. There’s a noise, a keening wail, and the woman turns around, seeing nothing. We’re in the same boat. 

That is, until I look at a smaller, black and white monitor. Standing in front of the woman is a rotten, lanky spectre, torn asunder, and enraged. 

“Right in front of you!”, I scream, but she can’t hear me. 

The objects in the room rattle. It’s enough to scare the wits back into the woman. She bolts to her bedroom door. 

The thing, that mournful thing grabs her by the arm. A sleeve of the woman’s housecoat crumbles, the flesh beneath it beginning to wither. 

She tries to pull free, but the grip of the spectre is immovable. 

She hammers down a hand, and somehow after three frantic blows, the spirit lets go, growling in rage. 

The woman gets distance between herself and the ghost, but the undead doesn’t bother to move. 

Small furniture flies like it’s been caught in a tornado. Windows rattle and fracture, sending broken glass in waves onto the carpet. 

The woman takes a wrong step, lacerating her foot, she holds onto a banister for support. 

The ghost laughs, the woman rises as if she’s been picked up by one leg. 

She’s screaming now, begging, blood pours from her torn foot into her eyes. 

   The spirit dangles her in mid air. Her arms begin to twist and warp, snapping and breaking. I try to cover the speaker, but it’s no use, I hear her pain. 

For a moment she’s still, then, defenceless, she falls. 

The feed on that set of monitors cuts out, and I’m jarred back to reality. Sweat beading, nails digging into the armrests of the cheap chair. 

“Well done guys, I’m not usually one for ghost stories, but that was, damn near worth the time.”, I say to whoever is keeping tabs on me. 

A few more hours of staring at the screens and there’s a loud klaxon. Jarring in the small room. The monitors shut off, and a pre-recorded voice says, “Now begins your ten hour rest period.”

There’s a handful of reasons I have trouble falling asleep, not the least of which is the amount of coffee I’ve had. 

A close second though, are those noises. I’ve watched everything from Psycho (great) to A Serbian Film (horrible) and not once has audio stuck with me so much. 



I’m woken by that same eardrum punching tone. Before I can brush the sleep from my eyes, a breakfast is shoved through the slot in the door. It’s about as well made as dinner was. 

More coffee, and half a cigarette later, I hear a voice from an unseen speaker. 

“Hey, um, Nathan?”, the voice says, I can hear paper rustling. 

“That’s me.”, I reply. 

“Hi,  call me Percy. I’ll be asking you a few questions about what you watched the previous day. 

If you have any for me, by all means, let me know.”, the voice is level, friendly. 

“I was expecting Adrien, to be honest.”, I say. 

Percy laughs, “This is a little below his paygrade. I’m just a guy working a job, like yourself.

Bit nicer digs, but I’m also not making 2k a day.”

I smile. 

“So, what do you want to know?”, I ask. 

“Well, I’d like for you to give me your overall impression of what you’ve seen. With particular attention to things that stood out, or may have seemed odd.”, Percy replies. 

“The format is neat. You’d think it’d get obnoxious, but those actors you hired, and those effects, make it worthwhile. 

I’d cut down a little on the dead air though.

The ghost was scary, especially the wounding around the face, unique is probably the right word. 

The sound effects blew me away.

One thing though. Why did the ghost let go when that lady hit her? Didn’t make any sense. Maybe if she hit it with, a bible or something, but as is, I don’t know, kind of killed the vibe. Seemed a little lazy or silly.”, I explain. 

“Good catch Nate. I’ll have the higher ups have a look into that. 

Not a bad way to earn a few grand, eh?”, Percy replies. 

“It’d be better if I wasn’t hanging around with the ghosts of my own farts, that vent  isn’t doing a damn thing.”, I joke. 



The next three days go by in much of the same way. I scan the monitors till something spooky happens and do my best to point all of the plot holes and stupid things I find. 

Not that there’s much to pick apart. The variety alone makes things worthwhile. I’m seeing ghosts, demons, a couple of slasher villain types, and a handful of different creatures. Despite the sponge baths, and stale air, it’s honestly a dream job. 

But I wouldn’t be posting here if the dream didn’t turn into a nightmare. 

Day 5 shows me what this place is really about. 

Breakfast comes, the same as always. A dish I dub Greyggs. Due to their color and my love of a good portmanteau.

I answer some questions on the last thing I watched, (some kind of monster fight club. Seemed way too action oriented. More like fantasy than horror really.) and get ready for another day. 

My selection consists of an empty barn, a deep forest and…

“Adrien, I said in the interview, no AI bullshit. I’m out, open the door, and if you want your 20k back, you can see me in court. I’m not going to be part of the downfall of art.”, I say. 

No reply. 

My issue is, I’m recognizing one of the places I’m watching on a set of monitors. 

Kumar’s Comics. Now, I’m not much of a geek, but I’ve been known to buy a comic or two. And while I’m not in there every day, I know the owners well enough. 

Kumar and Jaspreet Patel. A little over middle aged and the kind of folks that truly love what they do. 

There is no way, other than some kind of generative special effects I’m watching them. 

“Guys, I’m serious.”, I say. I try to sound enraged but, I hear the anxiety in my voice. 

“It’s 20k.”, I whisper to myself, justifying tossing my artistic morals to the wind. 

The more I watch, the more people I know I  see, the more I’m actually impressed. I hate saying anything good about AI, but if I didn’t know better I’d swear I was actually watching cameras hidden in the shop. 

The longer I watch the more I think that this can’t just be some kind of special effect. 

I try to shake the thought, but as the hours slowly tick by, it’s all I can think about. 

But, what can I do? How could I prove things one way or another?

My hand starts to move toward my phone, a plan forming. 

The second I grab it, a loud speaker-distorted voice hits me like a slap in the face. 

“Nathan, do you know much about firing squads?”, Adrien says. His voice calm.

“What? No, why?”, I stutter. 

“In any firing squad, one man is given a rifle loaded with a blank. None of them know who.  

The reason why, is that certain actions carry a weight. One that’s too heavy to carry for most. No matter how noble the intention. 

It leaves that sliver of doubt that maybe you didn’t really do anything.  It’s how most members of a firing squad sleep at night. 

If you make that phone call, it’s only going to make things harder for you. Cling to that doubt, cling to it like a life raft. “, Nathan explains. 

“What are you saying?”, I ask. Panicked. 

“As little as possible, for your sake. 

And I have to remind you, using your device to communicate is against the rules of your contract and will be dealt with.”, Nathan threatens. 

I feel like I’m on the edge of a cliff. On one hand, I know this is all just some game. Spooking me out is the point. 

But on the other, a lot of things aren’t adding up. 

I dial the number, I hear the ring echo through the monitors. My heart drops, I feel sick to my stomach. 

My phone disconnects, when I look down, I don’t even see the “for emergency calls only” prompt, just a string of strange illegible characters. 

I hear Adrien sigh, then the speaker cuts out. 

A few seconds later, the industrial toilet/sink combination starts spewing water. 

It goes on for minutes, soaking everything in the room and leaving about 3 inches of standing water. 

I’m shivering, scared, and I understand how truly fucked I am. 

“Watch the monitors Nathan. You may not understand, but you’re helping to save life as we know it.”, Adrien demands. 

What else can I do? 

The day slowly trickles by, every customer, every shadow makes my heart stop. 

Around 11pm, Kumar and Jaspreet begin to close down the shop. I think maybe they’re safe. Is this just another of the feeds where nothing happens?

No one likes being proven wrong, myself included. 

The door wasn’t locked. A short, stocky man in a dragging raincoat and beat up fedora walks in. 

“Sorry buddy, store’s closed. Open up bright and early tomorrow though.”, Kumar says. 

The man ignores him. The stranger’s faded plaid coat catches on a set of action figures knocking them over.

“Sir, show a little more care, please.”, Jaspreet says, nicer than necessary.

The stranger laughs, mockingly. 

I catch an angle of his face. Pale, rotund, and full of small lesions. They look almost like burns. 

But as he grins, I see it. Each of his teeth are small clusters of wire. 

“Get out, fucking run!”, I scream at the screen. But of course they can’t hear me. 

I know what this guy is, or at the very least what he’s capable of, I can’t just sit here. 

But what choice do I have?

Yesterday, I’d have probably said he’s the worst thing I’ve seen. He’s not really scary, and his gimmick seems tacky. 

The thought makes me sick to my stomach. The callousness I’ve viewed peoples trauma with. 

I vomit, the noise it makes in the standing water makes me retch a second time. 

“Okay, Dick Tracy, time to get out of my store before I call the cops. You have ten seconds.”, Kumar says in a commanding tone. 

The stranger snickers again, then turns to Kumar and his wife. 

I don’t speak Hindi, but the squat man does. What he says shocks Kumar enough he picks up the phone and dials 911. 

Of course, there’s no dial tone. 

The lights flicker, then dim, then go out completely. 

Kumar and Jaspreet use their phones as a light, trying to find their way to the door. 

They reach it, but it doesn’t budge. Kumar begins to rattle the door. 

There’s an electric arcing sound, then above them, is a twisted grin made of arching wire. 

I don’t catch much of the violence, by the time the stranger sinks his teeth into Kumar, they both dropped their phones. 

The feed cuts out, I feel light headed, like nothing is real. 

But it is, all of it. I just watched people I know get killed by a c-list urban legend. 



I don’t sleep, by the time I hear Percy, I’m staring angrily at a wall. 

""Hey, I've got about ten seconds to talk. 

You need to think about this like getting drafted into a world war. It sucks, it’s going to change you, but it’s for the fate of the world.    “, Percy says, his voice panicked. 

“Why the hell are you doing this, why are you killing people?”, I scream. 

“ We’re not. Every place you’re watching is the result of months of research, and even then it doesn’t always pan out. 

But the higher ups, they don’t fuck around. 

Do your time, get out. Don’t let anything get in the way of that.”, Percy pleads. 



From then on out, things don’t feel interesting, or exciting. Knowing what I know, the violence hits home, it fucks with my head. 

The worst are the stupid ones. The kind of things I’d share with my friends for the sole purpose of mocking the writer. Something about a creature or spirit that can be accurately described as cringeworthy, taking someone’s life is shocking and dismal. 

Then there’s the cell itself. After the first day of standing water spots of mold and veins of mildew start to develop on the walls. 

A couple of days after that, I’ve got a cough that won’t quit. It’s my second concern beyond what I believe is a case of trench foot. 

Things are miserable, torture really. 

By day ten it’s all I can do to focus on the screens in front of me. I’m running a fever, one of my toes is turning a foul shade of green. 

That morning’s breakfast comes with a familiar looking stack of papers. 

I laugh, then cough, I see blood in the phlegm. 

It’s a contract, another two weeks of my life to have the water drained and some antibiotics. 

Of course there’s another 20k in it for me, but at this point I’d burn the god-damned money just to get out of here. 

But truth be told, I don’t know if I’m going to last another four days without medical attention and air without spores in it. 

I sign, of course I do. It’s not like I have a choice. If it was a case of being shot, maybe I’d be brave enough to face the music instead. But the thought of dying a slow, infected death in this sodden cell terrifies me. 

There’s no happy ending here. I’m still in this cell, day 13 in fact. 

The first day since the 5th I’ve seen a familiar place. 

My cell. 

It sits, perched  in a corner of the room, looking down at me from the ceiling. I can’t see it when I look, but on an old, green-tinted monitor it lurks. 

I can’t make out much of it besides what I think is a rusted old army helmet. It’s long, brass teeth reflect the scant light in the cell. 

Water is flooding my prison as I finish typing this, a punishment for reaching out to all of you. 

This is my cry for help.  My scream to the void to try and figure some way out of my situation. 

But this is also my warning. Something is happening in the world, something big, and chaotic, and worse than anything we’ve seen before. 

Rules are breaking, logic is failing, things aren’t what they seem. 

And someone, somewhere out there is keeping an eye on all the Reddit threads and Youtube comments, looking for those people that know what they’re looking for. Those of us who live and breath urban legends and ghost stories. 

Watch your back guys. I don’t know what else to say.

I don't want to say I fell in love with this woman from my college bit I think I did. We became pretty good friends and had seen each other pretty often. It felt like we had a good vibe going, I then decided after a good year of knowing her, imma tell her straight up. We sat in a car in like a blizzard, talking about it. Man I wish we could've lived in that moment forever, she just want sure of being with me and even mentioned me being a kin to her brother. She just wasn't feeling it, she didn't feel the same. 

After that it went down fucking hill. I started getting jealous more and more and I started drinking and just behaving like an idiot. Not just because of her, but I'm talking about her right now. Our college shut down and now the relationship was distant and we hardly see each other. We do work at the same seasonal job and it's a pleasure to see her in a team work orientated environment. I did try to pursue her after our talk a few times but now I'm pretty much done. I just can't shake that thirst for us to just do what we did before. Occasional coffees, some banter and just ball busting fun, showing interest in what the other does. 

What happened? Feelings between me and her aren't mutual and part of me desperately wishes it was mutual in a romantic way. She is just great. She can talk her own head off, while I personally just love to listen to her yap and yap. She is so fucking friendly and just banters with everyone I love it and fucking hate it because that shit makes me so damn jealous when she smiles at a MF who is a bit of a douche and just bounces off of them with so much excitement and engagement and wit.

 I still get her charismatic energy but she seems almost drained now too, drained from life just stacking stress on her and I wish I could help her. Speaking to co workers and even some of her family that also works with us, she's been through some shit, but she's pushing strong y'all and even started going back to her faith. And I don't think anyone will understand how bad I wish I can be there to do anything for her. Just anything whether just asking ""hey how are you"" can make her happy, it's makes me happy, like making my own family happy and proud. Now maybe I'm just a obsessed motherfucker and I gotta get off my Joe Goldberg shit 😭

Just to put a cap to this y'all was I ultimately the issue? Why couldn't I get this to work or at least just get it out of me? I've dated other women since her , I have, but man she still just gets me tangled at times. And don't fucking come to me with that ""work on yourself bro"" mother fucker I AM. I finished college with a 3.9 gpa, I am working and plan to work 3 jobs to save up for a car and to possibly get my masters or try to get some gain on a career and a path and get a house, I'm in shape and keeping up with my health, I have hobbies that I love doing now, I'm going through the therapy, I am starting to actually bother with talking to my family, .  Y'all I'm set for fucking great things and I know I can do it with humility and confidence, but I can't deal with the fucking rejection of this one fucking woman, who honestly might be a a piece of shit or some dirt bag and I'm just rose tinting my goggles to her. I can make so many women smile hell anyone smile and I don't even want something from them. I love being kind and friendly, but maybe I'm just a liar and I should've pulled the plug on everything years ago 😕 ",1,1763873361.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I’m happy to announce that MKT Toolbox has returned! https://mkttoolbox.com

For those who missed it, MKT Toolbox [shut down last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartTour/comments/1otah5g/mkt_toolbox_shutting_down/) due to a variety of personal reasons by the previous maintainer, aturtledude.

I’ve worked with Sam (Toolbox’s original developer) and aturtledude a bit in the past, so upon hearing the news I reached out to see if it was possible for me to take over the Toolbox, and they agreed. Over this past week, I have been working directly with them to move everything over to my server where I’ll continue maintaining it for the foreseeable future.

There are still a few issues we’re aware of; including general stability, and an issue with Sign In with Google (working on it), but as of now I feel that it’s in a state where I’m comfortable opening it up to the public again. Please keep in mind that under heavy loads, slowdown will undoubtedly be noticeable.

All data from the last day of the Toolbox has been lost due to the timing of the backup process, but fortunately with the Sync feature, it shouldn’t matter so much.

I highly encourage anyone that is able to send a donation Sam’s way (you can find a link in the bottom left corner of the Toolbox) to do so. None of this work would exist without him and he has done a lot to keep it alive even long after he passed the torch.

On that note, I had a few people inquire about ways to support me for the purposes of contributing to hosting costs and future server upgrades. If you’d like to do that, you can [buy me a coffee here](https://buymeacoffee.com/Ramen2X). Thank you so much!

1p4dts3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1p4dts3/rules_for_me_not_for_thee/,Rules for me not for thee,"I have a healthcare job that I genuinely enjoy the kind of work that I do. It’s had its ups and downs as most do. I left a job I was really, really good at because it didn’t fit my lifestyle (I had a newborn) and found that I liked this new career.

I have become a strong voice in the work that I do, a “look to” and a “gold star” in terms of my work. I get good feedback from groups we work with and clients we work with. I firmly believe anyone can do my job if they put the brain power into it because there are zero areas of black and white. frankly there are zero shades of gray - the entire job is full of so many twists and turns it makes the day colorful. 

I have two teammates, E & M, that I work closely with and who I have trained. We get along probably 80% of the time. We enjoy team bonding every quarter. We buy each other snacks, coffees, etc. our supervisor is a good supervisor, G, who moved up from the position - she trained me actually but did leave the position for a little over a year so I have been in the position the longest out of us. Because of this, I am very well known by hospital staff and am known as someone who will have an answer (or will get it if I don’t.)

I don’t know if it was intimidation or insecurity but there was a request made by M, that if someone from the hospital reaches out to me on a patient (but they’re not in my section) to just ignore the request and add M to the chat (Epic Messenger) right away and leave it. Regardless of how long it may take M or E to answer the other person. This was difficult for me in the beginning, especially when most people didn’t know to also reach out to E & M instead of just me. After a few reprimands from supervisor G, I started thanking the people reaching out and added that whoever took care of that patient would handle their question, and I added them and left chats. During this time, however, E & M would answer questions for people in my split. I didn’t say anything. They would do each other’s work but would complain if I did the same for them. It felt double sided. I expressed this to G who said just to keep letting them be on their own so they could learn. So I did.

Recently, there was a time sensitive question that got brought up to me but M was in a meeting. I handled the situation, notified M as soon as they came back, and they took over the situation. I didn’t think much of that afterwards. Then another staff member approached me about someone in M’s alphabet split, I thought M was unavailable so I started a conversation with a colleague to get the answer. Then M left for a short break. When they returned, I had started on a different project and forgot about the request - since the colleague hadn’t replied yet. Once the colleague replied, I added M to the chat, explained why the conversation w/colleague had happened, and left the chat. M immediately responded negatively to me and raised their voice saying I shouldn’t have done anything to begin with. I apologized and said that I didn’t know they had been available from the start (since the staff member came to me right away and mine and M’s spaces are right next to each other.) M continued to get loud and be frustrated at me and the situation to which supervisor G pulled us into their office and sided with M saying that it seemed like I didn’t trust E or M. I have expressed this as being untrue many times and said while I trust them the only thing I get flustered with is that I find it bad customer service to leave time sensitive matters left on read (which they do.) G said I can’t help out because I “know everything” and they need to learn the job. I am conflicted on this too since we are often preached at to “handle things when they come up and when we can to make things smoother!” But are reprimanded when we do.

M grunted through this whole confrontation between G and myself and only continued to say they didn’t want me to do stuff in their split. I said, “fine. I won’t. I am sorry. I hear you.” I do believe E & M will continue to do things in each other’s splits. I walked out of G’s office, and went back to my space. I still said goodbye to M and E on the way out that evening but the whole thing soured me. I am both held to the same standard yet higher expectations? We have the same job titles. I have been there many years but both E & M have only been there 1yr and 10mo. 

I feel extremely singled out and frustrated. I don’t know. Maybe I am TA. I don’t know what to do at this point. I like my work. I normally like those I work with. Should I job hunt or hold out until we all work from home?

TL;DR: teammates don’t want me helping but will help each other and they get mad when others reach out to me for help. ",1,1763873076.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

# Gravity’s Mind - Chapter 5 - The Tharsis Canals

***Gravity changed first.***  
***Before the rebellion.***  
***Before the missing guards.***  
***Before Xylia’s eyes turned black.***

*The sun is pulsing with impossible waves—Carrington patterns that shouldn’t exist.*  
*An unseen object has slipped into a polar orbit no telescope can track.*  
*And deep under the Tharsis Canals, the ground vibrates with something ancient waking up.*

*Mars thinks it’s at war.*  
*Mars is wrong.*

*Something else has arrived.*

∞∞∞

**Electricity arced across the palace approaches.** Evacuation chimes screamed, and Pericles’ forces were already hammering the outer guard with shock rifles.

Catharine Elizabeth Thalia stood at the tall window of Palace Trianon—a palace named for the sister she’d never truly known. It was never truly home, just carved crimson rocks stacked in orderly precision. Keystones of the Stratocracy. A palace built by Krrel—in his image. A throne she was never meant to touch.

Catharine steadied her breathing. *Why linger?*

Her bitten nails scraped the stone sill. Below, servants rushed through tunnels toward the transports, their voices echoing across the marble like fragments of a collapsing world.

Between the ripping artillery bursts, the chandeliers flickered. The grand arched glass trembled but refused to break. The fire of war erupted above the Tharsis plains.

Catharine squinted at a distant explosion. The concussion rippled the glass. For a split second she imagined that she was Krrel—fighting the traitors.

Despite her father’s indifference, Catharine wanted to return to this place one day—when Pericles was extinguished. When the fighting stopped.

Whether she ended up pawn, princess, or queen—for the moment, that choice lived in the crosshairs between her father and Pericles, not in her own hands. This lonely palace—and even the approaching assault—felt more familiar than the life waiting beyond these walls.

She imagined Rafael flying her away into the stars. A life of dangers and unknowns. No lady-in-waiting. No butlers. No master of the palace and no duty to Mars. 

A bright flash rose above the palace. The chandelier above her swayed and the crystal chimed. When the floor shook Catharine braced her feet like a soldier. 

What if she was directing the forces of Mars? Not by ambition or the pursuit of power, but by a focused strategy.  *Could I—?* It would need to be brutal. Decisive.

Catharine looked to the hall. *I should leave.*

From further down the hall… a scratching sound, like a chair being dragged on tile. No one should be in that wing.

Hesitant, she stepped back from the window into the bedchamber hall, moving past the spiral staircase and the old nursery. Something unexpected caught her eye.

At the end of the corridor, beneath the door of her little sister’s room—a bright light trembled as if disturbed by movement—and shadows like shoes.

“Who’s there? Show yourself! What are you doing in Xylia’s room?”

The princess punched the door open. No one was allowed here since—

Nothing moved, yet every light was on, brighter than the explosions outside, and the draperies stood open toward the southern horizon. The air felt too still, as if the room had been holding its breath for years. Star pictures adorned the walls. Her sister’s strange geometry and mathematics were scattered across the papers on her sideboard. A blue quilt and three pillows fluffed under the canopied bed. The canopy fabric adorned with planets and stars.

A faint floral scent rose from the sideboard. She reached for the little perfume bottle—then put it down.

The memory hit like a slap. The day she’d held Xylia’s hand in the laboratory. When they took her stars away—before they changed Mars instead.

“Xylia…” She sighed. “Such big dreams for such a little girl.” *You really didn’t belong here*. Her mother had been right to protect the palace. Catharine stood silently. Could she be cast aside as well, at the will of another? My voice is mine. My thoughts are mine.

Instead of being stored away, her sister’s little telescope sat in the middle of the solar next to the panoramic window. Why didn’t I notice that before?

Catharine’s breath tightened. This was wrong.

A ruffle of fabric sat at the foot of the bed. 

The princess picked it up and smiled a sad smile. A broken doll.

She stepped forward and knelt to the marble. Its eyes were ripped out. She swallowed. No arms. No legs. A shredded clump of straw hair. Seeing the blue eyes on the floor made her sick. It was Lizzy. Her childhood doll. Her hand trembled. White lights. Her mother’s voice. Her sister’s hand. *Xylia, you are not here!*  
  
She jerked her hand back, heart racing, fingertips stung. *I didn’t do anything to you. I tried to help. I stayed with you. I didn’t hurt you, Xylia. I didn’t.* Nothing answered back. Only the air, and her own nerves betraying her.

The palace walls shuddered like an earthquake and the chandelier above flickered twice.

It had a blue dress to match her eyes. The doll the Queen gave me when Xylia went away. A gift for the daughter who stayed in a palace built for Krrel’s firstborn.

∞∞∞

**The Noctis shipyards flickered like a dying forge.** Raf Corin rolled the battered Galvex-I and watched flames crawl across the trusses, sparks pouring from collapsing gantries as engineers sabotaged crane motors before Pericles could seize them. The high G turn pushed him hard against the metal buckles.

He felt oddly calm above the chaos. His canopy filled with the black starry sky. The Big Dipper stabbed the night in perfect diffraction spikes, quiet and steady in a way Mars never was.

*If I could fly far enough…*

He huffed a dry laugh. A miner with a sore back and a stolen fighter, dreaming of the stars. A childish dream—for him, and for a princess trapped in Krrel’s dynasty.

The display flickered. Low fuel. Always low fuel.

Nudging the control yoke left, Raf Corin banked the Galvex-I. Every correction made the pilot’s seat rattle. He set course for the mothballed repair centre at Phoenicis Lacus. The controls were stiff; the old fighter argued with him, shuddering through the canyon-hugging turn. Stubborn to the end, it scraped the rock face with its landing skids, sending a rattle of boulders tumbling into the valley below.

“Blast—that was too close,” he said, pulling back on the yoke.

“Tough as iron.” Raf thumped the console twice in respect.

*Besides, who would be crazy enough to take a chance in the copilot’s chair?* Not Catharine. She was already getting caught up in Krrel’s craziness. Raf adjusted the throttle, his heart grew heavy with regret. She was pretty—except when the lure of the crown caught her eye. A privileged few empowered by the sweat of others. He made a fist. She belonged to their world, not his.

The lift engines answered with a throaty hum. Almost defiant, then coughed out a single plasma backfire as he shifted into descent mode.

Reaching over the copilot position, he closed the lift-motor intakes.

Raf exhaled a small, private laugh. Xylia would look good there, and she knew everything about the stars.

For now, the stars remained out of reach, far above the valleys of Mars.

The moment the Galvex-I touched down, Raf felt the low, steady hum under his boots, as if the fighter were acknowledging something. He climbed onto the dorsal spine, fingers brushing armour thicker than anything the Stratocracy flew. The plating vibrated softly beneath his gloves.

“Reactive plating,” a gravelled voice called up. “Ain’t a weapon on Mars that’ll dent her.”

Raf twisted around. Old Sarrin limped into view, grease-stained jumpsuit hanging off thin shoulders. “Saints, boy… she’s older than Olympus itself.” He rapped the hull; the metal answered with a deep, confident metallic knock. “And she’s hiding more secrets than Krrel.”

“Even space for a dark-matter drive,” the old mechanic said, tapping the silvery hull with his wrench. The metal answered with a solid thud. “Doubt you’d find one.”

Old Sarrin—one of the last real artisan mechanics Raf had ever met—wiped sweat from his temples with a rag that smelled more of oil than fabric. “Nacelles for mag weapons. Enceladus magnet rail guns. This’ll out-punch everything we have here combined.” He opened an access panel. “...but we’ll burn her guts out with any of the new converters.”

“What do you mean?” Raf asked, clambering over the dorsal guns.

“Sixty-thousand-volt, five-phase power supply...” Sarrin poked his head in deeper. “Saints…”

“Something wrong?” Raf hopped down to the plated floor, stomach tightening.

“I’d bet my hat this old gal’s configured for a quantum power supply. Yup—entanglement stabilization.” He slammed the access hatch and looked up at Raf. His long grey eyebrows rose when he patted the hull. “This one here... she has secrets.”

“Wait here.” Sarrin jammed the oily rag in his pocket and hobbled off toward the equipment racks. His hips swayed from side to side and his knees bowed past his ankles.

The repair centre felt crowded, packed with silvery Stratocracy interceptors—hard, elegant shapes parked along the ridge. The Galvex-I looked thick beside them, like a wrestler in the middle of a palace ballet: blocky, analogue, and missing enough parts to be halfway to a scrapyard.

The palace might end up a scrapyard, too, he thought. Maybe that was all Mars knew how to do—burn out its tools and people for other men’s wars.

What would happen here on Mars if he left? Slaving under Krrel’s proclamations or worse, Pericles. Maybe the miners would forgive him. Maybe they wouldn’t. Mars had a long memory for those who ran.

*I didn’t cause the problems on Mars, and maybe I’ll just leave—*

For a minute the clatter of the repair centre grew quiet. The sun was going down. 

The stars felt closer here, as if he could touch them. His dream felt real.

*Crazy-ass power supply?* Raf looked up and focused on one star. Its light pulsed like a heartbeat. 

*I wonder how far the quantum thing would take me—and how fast?*

*Ha… probably not far enough*. He cracked his knuckle and rapped the hull with his fist.

Shipyard floodlights lit up in sequence.

“She’s got personality,” Raf muttered.

“Let’s give her some more,” old Sarrin answered, plodding back with a heavy electrical contraption that looked part generator, part mad-scientist’s toy. “Arthritis is kickin’ me today, boy.”

“I’ll help.”

“You’re not touching this one, kid.” Sarrin stared him down, flinched from a stab of pain, then leaned in and pushed the access panel open again.

“What is it?” Raf asked, peering over the old man’s shoulder.

“Q-103 energy inverter. Reliable as hell. This’ll outlast the ship.” Sarrin tinkered without looking up. “Fellow named Vireaux left it here…”

The mechanic pointed to a deep gash on the Galvex. ""But the hull’s torn up bad from the rocks. I’ll need to rig a jumper outside the hull plating.”

Mechanised fittings along the Galvex began to whir. Panels sighed open. Hidden hard points unfolded from the flat hull, each rimmed in a cold, glowing blue.

Sarrin smirked. “Fits perfectly, like—”

A clean breeze swept in from the canyon.

For a split second Raf thought of the princess. Then, unexpectedly, he imagined Xylia beside him instead.

“Like it was made for it,” Raf finished. The name Vireaux rose in his chest, sudden and bright like a remembered coin. Britt had said the same name and something about Enceladus.

“Where’s Enceladus?”

∞∞∞

**Shadows pooled between the columns** as Catharine moved through the fading light. Evening washed the marble in a cold sheen, turning the grandeur of the palace into brittle silhouettes. At every doorway, unfamiliar faces stood where loyal butlers once bowed. Tapestries sagged. Music had long since died.

Half-hidden behind a pillar, Catharine watched Major General Pericles advance through the empty enfilade. His steps cut the silence cleanly, each one deliberate, each arm swing sharp as a blade. Every footfall echoed like a gunshot in a tomb.  
  
He set his jaw as if the palace had always been his.

Catharine pressed into the shadows.

Her earliest memory of Pericles was the stare—too long, too cold. The way he feigned sympathy the day her mother died, his voice dripping with opportunity. He had been climbing ever since: scheming, whispering, slithering through aristocracy like a palace snake until he stood here tonight.

Whenever Mars needed a united front, he sowed dissent—especially in the elite forces he alone controlled.

Two traitors approached, wearing palace guard uniforms. Each saluted. “The palace is empty, Major General. Krrel is nowhere to be found.”

“He’s quivering in the canals with the rest of the filth,” Pericles said, his body still. “Bring him to me on his knees.”

“And what of the princess?”

“She will agree to a royal wedding, or witness her father quartered.” Pericles thumbed a ruby ring; his eyes darkened. “Tell me the troops are prepared for tonight’s attack.”

Anger tensed every muscle in Catharine’s body; she felt her ragged nails biting into her palms. She imagined him strapped to the Tractability table—where the Stratocracy burned the truth out of traitors.

Another squad approached. She could wait no longer. Pulling back deeper behind the column, Catharine’s eyes focused on a fold in the tapestry opposite. Behind it—a way out. 

She crossed the domed, marble parterre and slipped into the secret tunnels.

\*

Descending deeper, cooler air bled through the cobbled rocks. Staticky red soil clung to her boots and the tunnel breathed with faint vibrations. One of the first tunnels deep in the palace footings would lead her to her father—or the shipyards. Catharine paused. A soft rumble carried an echo in both directions. Two strategies were already staged at the palace walls above—Krrel’s and Pericles’. And if there was a third? Hers? Something no one expected? Insidious tactics to deal with Pericles and a calculated alignment alongside Krrel’s forces. 

The best maneuver is the one unknown. 

Catharine turned toward the shipyards and followed the tunnel that sloped down to the lower levels.

Tucked against the fire door at the end of the passage, Jendrick Pericles shivered. His undersized uniform strained at the buttons, sleeves too short. Catharine stepped out of the darkness.  
  
He flinched.

“You can’t go,” he stuttered. ""Lady Catharine… I mean… Catharine."" The boy’s eyes were uncomfortably revealing, locked on hers. His smile persisted.

“The miners saved your life, young regent,” she said, voice low and cutting. “Your father will cast you aside with his next child.”

""After which, you will toil in the kitchens or the mines."" Catharine smiled. ""Mars remembers.""

“My father will have your father killed,” the regent said. “Then he’ll make you my betrothed. If I choose you.”

Her pulse quickened. An anger inside her surfaced.

Catharine pressed a hand to his chest, pinning him to the door. ""I skin snakes alive and cast them to Tharsis.""

The veins in his neck stood out. His eyes wide in fear. Heat welled in her chest. Should the power feel natural—here in this dark place?

""Please..."" his voice weakened.

“Where does your father’s army march tonight?” she asked, her hand rising toward his neck.

“Choose now,” she said, digging her nails into his collarbone. The words sounded as if her father spoke them. There was no apprehension this time to weaken her voice.

""The shipyards... the shipyards."" He blurted out.

She shoved him into the corner. “You could come with me, Jendrick,” she said, knowing he wouldn’t.

""No."" He tried to hold on to pride. A free hand touched her sleeve—clammy, trembling.

She tore a brass button from his lapel and tossed it at him, pushing his hand away. The button rattled over the stone floor. ""Here. You'll need this.""  
  
""My father will get you,"" he muttered, frowning.

“Tell him I await him,” Catharine said, turning for the service tram. “He’s as afraid of me as you are, young snake.”

“Please… Catharine…” Jendrick’s voice came thin, fragile… hopeful in the wrong way.

\*  
She slipped into the unattended service tram that ran straight along the old canal line to the shipyards, where her perfume curled against the smell of scorched metal.  
“The shipyards,” she murmured. “I hope I remember how to work this.” The door hissed shut and the tram lurched, throwing her briefly off balance as it gained speed. Smoke-shrouded canal lights flickered faster as the tram accelerated.

*He’ll do what I want… the miner cares for me. He must.* In the windscreen’s reflection, for a moment she saw her father.

Clattering from the tracks drowned out her thoughts. She gripped the edge of the seat.

*“Raf… please be there…”* Her breath fogged the glass. For one heartbeat, she imagined his hand in hers.

Catharine placed her hand on the glass—but the fog had already vanished. The glass felt colder than before.

∞∞∞

**Raf folded the long white sleeves** into cuffs. His hands were scarred. Not clean like a technician.

Before Pericles’ assault and Earth’s warnings, the Observatory had been a dead place—quiet, shuttered, forgotten. Then the silence broke. Canal Seven roared back to life, brought back online in a heartbeat, its tunnels trembling with military transports. The miners whispered that the Stratocracy had uncovered something in the depths—something that terrified even them. Ore quotas spiked. Men collapsed. Fear spread. Raf felt it too. Whatever was buried here… it was waking.

*Where was Xylia?* She was supposed to meet him right here—at the elevator.

The Canal Seven tunnel was void of personnel. Too quiet. An empty transport shuttle sat one level below at the domed terminus. Fresh zipper-like imprints from the shuttle’s tracks scored the ground behind it. Heat wafted up from below, carrying the faint smell of hot metal. *Could be from the motors, if they drove it too fast…*

Brushing his scruffy hair back, Raf peered around the last bend in the tunnel. He zipped up the stolen lab coat he was wearing and pulled the collar up to his neck. He’d expected a buzz of activity. People to avoid, but no one was in the shafts or outside the observatory entrance.

Two empty chairs sat on either side of the double doors. Shock rifles leaned too neatly on the grey wall beside the doors.

*Where are the guards?* “Hello.” Raf’s voice was a half whisper.

He thought about grabbing a rifle, but instead picked up a sensor module.

Standing sideways, he drove his hip into the door, expecting soldiers to rush out. Instead it just swung back, nearly knocking the box out of his arms.  
  
*Nothing.* “Xylia?” Raf peered through the door.  
  
“Rafael—I’m here.” Xylia sounded preoccupied.

“Just us two? Where is everyone?” His voice echoed around the vaulted room. A high trussed dome arched overhead. Around the octagonal room were banks of instruments and computers. Two telescopes sat side by side on a gimbal. One was small. One the size of a spaceship. Small lights flashed along the optical tube.

“I want to show you something, just give me a minute.” Xylia stared at a glowing grid. Within it were the Earth, Sun and Mars… and something else.  
  
“This doesn’t feel right—like a loose tunnel brace down in the mines.” Raf lifted a tipped-over chair and picked up an electronic tool. He placed it on the console beside him.

A coffee cup sat next to some control levers and buttons. Raf touched it. “It’s still warm. Like someone left it seconds ago.”

He needed Xylia to be safe.  
  
“Xylia?” Raf raised his voice. “Tell me the truth—what happened?”  
  
“Nothing—nothing, Rafael.” Her voice evasive.  
  
“This coffee’s still hot.” He clenched his teeth. “There were people here. Where are they?”  
  
“No one was here, Rafael.” Xylia paused too long. “It was empty.”

He picked up a pair of glasses and held them up in the light. One of the lenses was cracked. He swallowed. Someone had left in a hurry.  
  
“Are you sure?” Raf’s voice was leading but trusting. “I want to believe you, Xylia, but…”

“Come here, I want to show you something.” Xylia pulled him close to the display.  
  
“Here and here… these are gravity waves,” she said, pointing to moving blue lines.

The holo lines sharpened.  
  
“If you say they are… but why are we here?” Raf looked up. “And what happened to your hair?”

Raf pushed the coffee cup further away.

“And by the way… when do I get my rescue kiss?” he asked pointed at his cheek.

“What?” Xylia made an exasperated frown, then smirked for a split second.  
  
“There’s white streaks going through it. Those weren't there before.” Raf brushed his own hair mirroring the white highlights. “They look kinda cute—”  
  
“It’s nothing,” she said, pulling him by the collar. “Look at this.”  
  
“That’s the sun, right?” Raf tilted his head.

The display reproduced a solar flare where the blue lines glowed.  
  
“Yes, and these gravity waves shouldn’t be there.” Xylia looked serious, like she was willing him to understand.

“Okay.” Raf pretended that what she said was meaningful. “So… what?”

“They’re causing the solar flares. At least… I think that’s what’s causing them.”  
  
“So what’s that got to do with Mars?” Raf paused. “I mean that’s good isn’t it? Cooking Earth… warming up Mars?”

Several blue lines converged on the floating solar image.

“Something’s making them Rafael!” Xylia’s voice was urgent. “Something’s changing the sun!”

“Blast.” Raf looked at her. “But who?”  
  
“I don’t know, but we can tell when it started,” she explained.  
  
“When? How are you supposed to know that?”

The holo-display reversed in time, until there was one large solar flare erupting from the sun.  
  
“See this calendar?” Xylia pointed to the numbers. “These are Carrington increments—Carrington years. Carrington discovered solar flares back on Earth a long time ago.”

“Huh?” Raf raised his eyebrows. There was something underneath, beside Xylia.

“How do you know that?”  
  
“Look, Rafael, try and understand me.” She held his gaze. “This is Carrington Year—”

“172.” He answered. “Is that when they started?”

Just under the metal console where he stood, he noticed a single black military boot—fully laced. Two bloody marks moved away from the boot toward an exit hatch. His stomach tightened. Whoever it was, they didn’t go willingly. 

On the floor a pair of gloves and a fresh red handprint on the wall beside the door. The red mark dripped. Raf cracked his knuckles nervously.

Within the trussed dome above, a movement caught his eye, but it was just a part uniform and guard helmet someone stuck near the telescope aperture. *Probably a joke.* No one could physically climb up there. Impossible. A wave of vertigo twisted his stomach and prickled his skin.

*Did Xylia do this?*  
  
“Yes, at least the gravity waves don’t appear before then.” She smiled faintly, as if he finally understood the stars.

“But that’s not all…” she said, rotating the hologrid. “Look at this—”

“What is that, more gravity waves?” The display turned Mars and Earth on its side with a blue ring cutting them in half. Raf looked at her eyes. They were captivating, bright with a focus he didn’t fully understand.

The holo image panned back to the orbit of Mars and the Earth, this time with a ghostly intersecting green elliptical line. It pulsed slowly.

“Yes, but it's in a polar orbit.” Xylia moved her hand in a circle. A small electrical filament seemed to dance off her fingertip for a split second. “That’s why it’s hard to see.”

“Xylia, you can tell me anything.” Raf’s voice leaned toward the truth he wanted to hear.  
  
“Rafael—nothing happened. I promise.” Her voice was quick and her eyes looked serious. “Look at this orbit. It only intersects Mars once, maybe twice a year.”

“The green planet?” He remembered showing Xylia the childhood colouring, the way she’d had terrible tremors.

“Is that what they were trying to stop you from seeing? Xylia—”

Just like in the alien lab, it started again. Her pupils went wide until the white of her eyes disappeared and all that remained was coal black. The pressure in the air changed around them and the hair on the back of his hand stood straight up. His tongue felt suddenly dry. He flinched but hid it from her. To Raf, Xylia looked like someone else.  
  
Her pupils consumed the light. Black—like a collapsed star. 

A vibration passed through the ground. As if Pavonis Mons was speaking again from deep below Mars.

“Rafael—you know that I’d never hurt you—”

Epilogue

*Above Mars, Phobos shuddered.*

*Britt froze mid-step as the lights flickered across the abandoned installation. Not a quake… not machinery.*  
*Something outside. Something big.*

*At the same moment in Noctis, a sabotaged power core spat blue fire, startling the artisans who’d been gutting it. Even they paused; the ground had moved, just once, like Mars itself was listening.*

*And in Hellas Planitia, Krrel’s drill finally struck the molten alloy vein. The glowing metal pulsed, brighter than physics should allow, as if something beneath the crust had answered him back.*

*None of them knew it yet.*

*But whatever woke in the Observatory with those gravity waves…*

1p4dsct,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4dsct,It’s Wriothesley’s Birthday! (Nov.23rd),"
I could have flaired this as a mixture of celebration, date outing and romantic gush but today is Wriothesley’s Birthday! 

His birthday art looks so beautiful. He’s looks so handsome and I just wanna kiss him and gently caress his scars. 

On Friday we went out on a date for his birthday! The reason we did Friday and not today is because we Orginally we’re gonna go to an arcade and I wanted to go when there would be less people, but I ended up going to the arcade for my birthday so instead we just went on a date. We had breakfast together and then went to go see the new Wicked movie (I took him to see the first one last year and we saw the musical the year before). We then finished off the day with some dinner and then got coffee for dessert! It was a great day and I’m happy to spend it with him as always. 

I can’t believe another year has gone by. This is my third time celebrating his birthday and it just gets more special every year. We’ve both grown so much in our time of knowing each other and I just hope I can make him as happy as he makes me. I found tons of fanart today and he looks so happy in all of them! I’m so glad I get to see his smile everyday. I would rant more but for some reason I can’t find the words to explain how truly grateful I am for today. Today is a day to celebrate the best boyfriend in the whole universe (Well, imo since he’s my soulmate). Even though today is a special day I hope to make everyday full of the warmth and joy he brings me. 

I might not have much to say but I love you Wriothesley, and happy birthday ❤️",8,1763872944.0,FictoChill,4,1.0,False

We ended up working on a presentation together and met up exactly 2 times. (we had a really nice friendly conversation both times). After we were done with the presentation, I wanted to ask her out to a coffee date. Right before class, I tried but kind of chickened out and asked instead about a club she used to be in that I was interested in joining. She mentioned their socials but then we both got to our seats.

The next week, I summoned the courage to ask properly. I said something like, ""Are you doing anything after class?"" to which she replied that she was going to meet some friends to get something to eat. I then said, ""Ahhhhh, ok. I was going to ask if you wanted to get coffee after class but I understand.""

She thought for a moment then said we could do it this coming Monday instead. I obviously agreed and said ""See you then!""

I can't tell if this is an actual date or just going out as friends. I see it as a date (I'm hoping that she does too), but I feel like I need a fresh perspective, especially from a woman.",1,1763872803.0,dating_advice,9,0.67,False

1p4doe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p4doe1/ms_rancorous/,[MS] Rancorous,"I’ve seen the walls of this room far too many times. It was one of the rooms that looked so cold, the warmth of it became unsettling at one point. Sometimes, I truly believe my entire life starts and ends in this very room, trapped within these four walls coloured in shades of teal that were so light, one could mistake them for white. The room was devoid of any resemblance to life: it would have been barren if it weren’t for my desk, at which I seldom sat to work. The majority of my time was spent here, on the single sofa placed awkwardly in the middle of the room, alongside a coffee table that was too small to hold anything more than a few cups of coffee and a small pile of files. The only other place where I spent a good chunk of my time was the autopsy room, a place where one could argue a forensic pathologist, such as myself, would find my safe place.

Quite a sadistic thing to say, as my job involved me being surrounded by dozens of dead bodies a day. My life had been limited to these very corpses for the past few years of my life, and anything else was nothing more than a pitiful daydream I could not even imagine bringing life into. If I were to be honest, which I rarely am to myself nowadays, the only memorable years of my life were during my early high school days. Sure, I wasn’t wealthy enough to partake in those after-school activities most of the kids my age were in, but I often held my jealousy back by marveling at the opportunities others would get. It was during those times I discovered my love of music, or well, my admiration for a very certain musician. 

I never got her name, perhaps because I never dared approach nor talk to her. I stayed by the doors of the hall, and listened patiently as she sewed rhythms that were no less than hymns using her violin, like a prop in the background quietly admiring the main character. Whenever I feel like I’m drowning in a sea of loneliness, I like to think back at those moments, picturing how my life would’ve been different if I just gathered up the courage to talk to her once. Sometimes, I tell myself I would’ve talked to her, if I didn’t have to drop out of high school early because my father got wasted one night and beat up my mother so hard she didn’t wake up at all after that.

I probably wouldn’t have gotten this job, which I am reluctantly grateful for, if my dad wasn’t in this line of work. But I couldn’t stop my childhood trauma from leaking into my adult life, and maybe that’s why I didn’t dare get married despite being well into my thirties. Now, however, I sometimes understand my father and his outbursts. It’s not easy when you’re surrounded by corpses so much, you become physically disgusted by human interaction. Instead of craving the social life I desperately need, I bury my loneliness so deep into my chest that I imagine the deceased as my friends, with whom I am quite popular with, might I add.

A dead body could’ve been many things. A body can be anything, ranging from a respected noble-prize winner, to the most wanted criminal. But, whenever I’m working with them, on that autopsy table, that body is nothing more than a lifeless corpse. I could do whatever to it, and it won’t dare object. Maybe that’s what it means to be on the edge of insanity.  You tend to lose your priorities. But then again, if all our fates lead us to being just another body in a refrigerator, waiting to be examined in a room that could suffocate you alive despite being decorated with ventilation systems all over, is anything worth prioritizing?

I once read a quote by Khaled Hosseini that said “Of all the hardships a person had to face, none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.” That was when I decided that if there was going to be a quote on my tombstone, it was going to be this one. Precisely because all my life, I had been punished with wait time and time over. Waiting for my father’s love, waiting for a certain violinist’s attention, and finally, waiting for my own death. I often think about the day I will become one of those countless bodies lying lifelessly on the autopsy table, wondering about the person who will do my post mortem. Will his days be more lively than mine? I will never get to know.

Forcing myself off of the sofa, I made my way to the autopsy room to finish my final examination of the day so I can then stumble onto the closest liquor store before I waste away one more night with my crippling insomnia. I opened the refrigerator and rolled out the body that had just arrived not even an hour ago. Transferring it onto the autopsy table, I dragged on a pair of gloves on my hands and slowly uncovered the cloth over the body… and froze.

A wave of recognition flooded my senses, followed by a subtle ache of panic. For the first time, I found the body in front of my familiar; except, she was nothing like I remembered her to be. Her milky skin was pale, as if the blood had somehow escaped the vessels on her cheeks. Her eyes, which I believe were so big they could take in everything around them, were pressed shut, and it seemed almost as if her eyelashes were resting on the bump under eyes… Wait, bump? I cleared the haze in my mind and focused onto her face, and sure enough, her eye was bruised, and seemed to be still swelling. Grabbing a hold of her hands, that once held a violin but were empty now, I felt a gentle warmness to them, despite being in the freezer for a little bit, which meant she had gone lifeless not too long ago. I didn’t miss the redness around her forearms and the little patch of pale skin on her finger surrounded by a brownish redness, as if her hand had been tanned and the only part that wasn’t affected was the little bit of her finger that was covered by a ring.

A wedding ring.

Her nails looked freshly painted, save for two fingers on her right hand that were chipped. Almost as if she had been painting her nails right before she was attacked. The back of her scalp had been cracked open, the kind of injury you would see if you were pushed harshly onto a glass wall or table.

Thoughts of all kinds flooded into my mind, led by a little voice in my head that insisted I wouldn’t feel so terrible if I confessed my feelings earlier. I wondered if she was jumped by a robber that broke into her home, or if she was abused by someone close… surely, I wouldn’t allow any of those to happen if I were nearby. Taking in her form once more, I raked my eyes over her lifeless frame. Her hair was longer than I remembered it, and her lips didn’t have that usual pinkness to them. I ignored the guilt creeping onto me when I realized I was purposely delaying her examination, perhaps to give myself a chance to say goodbye to her.

The door to the mortuary opened, and two nurses rolled in an empty autopsy bed, chatting among themselves. “It’s horrible, what happened to her.” One of them whispered, catching my attention. “She was so young, and beautiful too. How could a husband kill his own wife like that?” The creeping feeling in my gut worsened at the confirmation of my assumption. She was abused. As I began gently cleaning her face with a damp towel, I wondered what her plans were for the future. It definitely didn’t involve being here, lifeless on an autopsy table after being murdered by her own husband.

I took a scalpel and brought it near her skin, hesitating her a second. For the first time in a long while, my hands were shaking and my fingertips were slowly going cold. I couldn’t imagine cutting her open, but here I was. I had to do this examination, maybe then she’d get some sort of justice.

But I knew that wasn’t entirely true either. I had seen autopsy reports being fabricated far too many times. All it would take was enough money and connections with the right people, and her husband would be a free man, innocent and protected by the country’s laws. Perhaps, I could take justice into my own hands? I looked at the scalpel in my hand: I had only ever used it on the deceased, but if I were to use it on a living body…

My thought was irrational, and not said out loud at all at the risk of someone listening and concluding that I had lost my mind. But I don’t think I am hallucinating when I see a ghost of a smile on my little violinist’s lips, and feel a gentle hand hold onto mine, the one that was still grasping onto hers.

Letting go of her, I gently pressed the scalpel onto her cheek, tearing her skin off.

My thought is irrational, the closest I can come to giving her justice is by doing my part and examining her injuries carefully. However, a little voice in my head told me that if this autopsy report is fabricated, taking justice into my own hands is the first thing I should do.

I'd never heard that term outside of the podcast and just this evening, in a different Starbucks in another part of the US.

I was in the Starbucks for a while hanging out with someone (all the other coffee places in town were closed by that time of day, I feel the need to justify the fact I was just sitting in a Starbucks for hours). Apparently the guy who said Tommy Motz is a manager or something because as he and another employee left at the end of their shifts he thanked everyone for putting in extra time and effort and ended saying, ""What leaving joke should I tell? Oh, I know. ‘Let's make like a shower and flock off.'"" The other employee exiting with him said ""That's a good one.""

	•	trying to find a coffee shop that isn’t inside a megachurch
	•	the car dependency level compared to LA (which I didn’t know could get worse)
	•	the moment you realize humidity is just your new roommate
	•	how people somehow drive 95 mph while also being extremely offended that you’re in “their” lane
	•	the suburban sprawl where everything is 20 minutes away even when it’s “close”
	•	the difference between “Southern hospitality” and “I just want to see what you’re about”
	•	how socially normal it is to talk about your job, your house, your church, and your HOA in the first 10 minutes of meeting someone
	•	how people react when you say you don’t eat brisket
	•	how subtle (or not subtle) the LA → Dallas political transition feels in day-to-day life
	•	stuff locals think is totally normal but feels like a side quest if you’re not from Texas

I’m not looking for the political flame-war answers (there are enough of those already).
I’m looking for the real, lived-in insights — the funny, weird, unexpectedly wholesome, unexpectedly confusing realities of going from a blue city where half the population has a reusable water bottle collection… to a city where I’ve heard people casually use the phrase “my gun safe” in small talk.

If you’ve done this move, or you’ve lived in both places, what were the biggest surprises that hit you after the honeymoon phase ended?

What should I expect emotionally and socially, not just financially?

1p4dfef,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4dfef,"The Bamboo Room at Three Dots and a Dash (Chicago, IL)","Made it back to Chicago for the weekend and after a fun but somewhat underwhelming tiki experience last time I visited Three Dots and a Dash, I was excited to have a reservation for the Bamboo Room and boy did it exceed my expectations in some areas but then fall short in others yet again!

The good: I LOVE the quiet more intimate space. The main bar caters so much more to the North Loop drinking crowds that it's more like a glorified yuppie bar with incredible tiki drinks than a classic Tiki vibe. The Bamboo Room however, sticks the landing when it comes to calm, relaxing, and heightened sophistication almost reminiscent of those dark golden-age tiki bars we often hear so much about. The drinks were incredible and made with so much effort and execution that you can taste in every sip. The focus on technique is the highest I've ever experienced in my limited tiki bar adventures, and I'd highly recommend this for any tiki lover looking to expand their horizons on classics in a not-so-gimmicky approach to ""modern"" mixology. There's love and effort put in to the work here.

The not-so-good: The bar seats around 14 and only had 1 bartender and occasionally an additional person on staff to help. When they're full, which is easily often especially closer to and on weekends, service is SLOW. This can be a good thing if you're looking to relax all night and sip at a relaxed pace, though! Also, to nitpick, the only seating available are high tops so even though the vibe is relaxing, the seating is not (especially for these long drinking experiences). My group of 4 had 2 drinks max and we were there for more than 2 hours!

Overall, fantastic drinks, less than fantastic time but at least the vibes were great. I wouldn't blame the staff at all for the paced experience since that's just what it was. I'd wish they'd have at least 1 other bartender on staff per night just to allow more relaxed vibes from the staff, as you can tell having only 1 bartender for 14 made the bar feel extremely backed up immediately in such a calming and beautiful space.

1p4derq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1p4derq/trying_to_solve_safety_anxiety_for_girls_and_women/,Trying to solve safety anxiety for girls and women!,"Hi girls, my sister is a student , she left the hometown for studies around 3yrs ago and from that point of time everytime she step out of the hostel , it is the same question 'is this place safe'? She wanted to know, how general safety is, how safe is to take public transport or neighborhood is, how safe is for women? She tried asking many people , but all answers where based on 'vibes'. Sadly Google reviews is too generic rating on 'how good coffee is' ! 

Here's what I realized you will definitely know which place to go for best experience but not how safe is! No one wants to track this data and many people suffer from this a lot and many of you must have been also facing the same issue.

So I started building a product called **Safe or Not**, it is hyperlocal platform where you can search any location and read other people experience and post yours in seconds. For cherry on top we also added metrics like walkability, street lightning, transport facility  and precautions for free as of now to help you travel better and safer!

But to be honest, I want your support without your reviews or your support my platform is useless. 

Here is the link , for example this is for 'Delhi'- [Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/location/9f573beb-44df-4fd3-a3e5-75b30cf6021e)

You can search for 'Mumbai' or 'Bengaluru' or any location you like!

If you like the concept or product can you please drop a review or signup to support us! It will help literally lot of people to reduce there social anxiety.

Thank you!

The thing her is she lives in another province and I may be moving to another country and continent in a couple months, so I find it so refreshing and awfull at the same time, like it's bittersweet, and again, we just met and barely know eachother.
