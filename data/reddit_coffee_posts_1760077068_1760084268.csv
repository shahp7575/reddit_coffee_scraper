1o2v1wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PilipinasVolleyball/comments/1o2v1wz/when_pvl_became_an_unintentional_benchmark_part_1/,When PVL became an unintentional benchmark (Part 1: on what 🇮🇩🇻🇳 think about PVL),"In the ever-evolving world of Southeast Asian volleyball, a curious shift has happened — the Philippines’ Premier Volleyball League (PVL), once considered a league lagging behind in terms of quality of play, has now become a benchmark for how to market and commercialize the sport.

But recently before the ""first serve"", an [Indonesian Instagram page posted about the Reinforced Conference of the PVL](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPSOcmQk96A/?igsh=bDVxaWtoNm5kcnY=). and another write up from a Vietnamese volleyball fan page thinking that they're now behind club tournament wise

For years, Southeast Asian volleyball circuit only orbits around the Japan V. League and Volleyball Thailand league, serving as the models of the professional growth in volleyball across Asia. Now, let's talk about the PVL (If you're a ln international league fan, you will most likely disagree with me by saying ""eh bakit maiinggit sila eh ang baba ng play natin, sabay pa showbiz pa"", teka lang mga atecco wala pa nga yung listahan eh)

****🇵🇭 The PVL itself: from first serve to finale****- Every PVL match feels like a celebration for the fans as seen on On Tour and even in other conferences like All Filipino and Invitational Conference. Maganda rin ang media production ng PVL from OBB to championship round. The lights off, entrance ng mga players from teams who are determined to be the queens of the Philippine Taraflex. Even our Rookie Draft na akala mo nasa Oscar's Awards night ka dahil sa formal ng event. Fans of different teams have different efforts to cheer their teams. Loud chants from Ube Nation, face cut-outs from Creamline fans, yung drums kala mo extension ng UAAP lalo na pag finals (except nga lang sa recent final appearance na walang pagkakaisa ang drums.

Another from PVL, hindi lang OBB ang shinu-shoot nila, even other segments like ""Heart2Heart"", ""Hey Rookie"" and ""Heart Translated"" (for this Reinforced Conference). We also have off-season channels like #PVLOriginals. In this way, mayroon nang mga storylines na binubuo ni PVL for teams and players alike. Hence, the team branding 

Even we also noticed that we blended sports with star culture. And may branding lahat ng PVL teams like Creamline Cool Smashers, Choco Mucho Flying Titans, PLDT High Speed Hitters, even Farm Fresh Foxies has achieved although something other leagues yet to reached: brand loyalty. Amplified by strong fanbase, social media presence, charismatic players and ""fanney"" culture that can fill the seats.


****🇮🇩 The Indonesian reactions: PVL as Proliga's Wakeup call?****


When an Indonesian volleyball page posted an update about the PVL’s upcoming Reinforced Conference, the comment section exploded not with criticism, but with reflection.
Many Indonesian fans admitted that the PVL model offered practical lessons that Proliga could emulate.

One top comment summarized it perfectly:

 “Indonesia should start by building a truly professional league with proper clubs, not just temporary teams made for Proliga.
Maybe merge Proliga and Livoli, limit each team to one foreign player, and pick more affordable venues.
The federation must actively encourage more teams to join — if they stay quiet, nothing will change.”


This wasn’t an isolated opinion. Dozens of fans echoed the same concerns:

Limited Teams: Proliga’s small number of participants restricts player development and competition quality. In the recent Proliga, from 8 it dwindled down to 7 after Jakarta BIN suddenly disbands for unknown reason. But base on Indonesian sports outlets, Proliga has a planned expansion up to 16 teams starting next year, that is kung may private company who are willing to throw Indonesian Rupiahs for volleyball (and the reason why Proliga acquired high class imports because most teams are government owned)

Expensive Venues: Costs have become unsustainable, limiting access for smaller clubs.

Lack of Marketing: Despite talented players, matches often fail to generate buzz or online presence. For example, during the Finals na medyo wrong strategy sila for placing the venue into a non-volleyball region (Yogyakarta)

Import Dependence: Some fans proposed a “two-phase” system — an All-Indonesian conference for locals and a Reinforced one with imports, mirroring PVL’s structure with All Filipino and Reinforced Conference. And leave the mid-season for the National Team preparation. 


****🇻🇳 The Vietnamese Perspective: Marketing over Skills****

On what the Vietnamese page pointed out that PVL may not be at par of the top Asian leagues, but it still attracts fans and loud conversations online from Facebook, X, YouTube and even on TikTok (ayan, never ko na sine-censor ang socmed platforms kasi hindi naman to TikTok shop). In the blog titled [""Is Philippine Volleyball leaving Vietnam behind?"" ](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0xY9Exrrm8ij7Jfk1MYqMu4dqJ85H2EUULWPEaLToRdVcLtJ112NxHR3M8mfQpWrel&id=100026223655792&mibextid=Nif5oz) But they are not pointing out the athleticism, but they pointed out the marketing and visibility. Inside the article, they stated that Vietnam may be stronger than the Philippines in terms of physical strength however they admitted that the Vietnam Volleyball League lacks identity.

While PVL has catchy team names like Farm Fresh Foxies, Zus Coffee Thunderbelles, Nxled Chameleons and Galeries Tower Highrisers, Vietnam in the other hand heavily relied on the sponsor names as team names like VTV Bình Điền Long An, Hóa Chất Đức Giang. 

Fan interactions where PVL players have their own IG Broadcast channels and KUMU live, something Vietnamese athletes rarely do. 

PVL Matches can draw crowds (even the lesser known teams for the love of the game) while in the Vietnam side, it looks more like a closed door matches rather than a league. (Tried to watch one of their matches halos walang tao) 

PVL stars and fan favorites signs brand deals and endorsements. Vietnamese players on the other hand gained little to no attention unless they played overseas. 



What began as fan curiosity in Indonesia and honest critique in Vietnam has now sparked broader conversations about how to modernize the game without losing its soul. PVL may not be one of the top tier leagues right now but the fan curiosity from the neighbors might be learned something from the rising league (may Part 2 pa to, medyo mahaba kasi) ",2,1760083864.0,PilipinasVolleyball,0,1.0,False
1o2v1nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/webexpertfromrwanda/comments/1o2v1nx/how_a_kigalibased_tech_firm_is_helping_rwandan/,How a Kigali-Based Tech Firm Is Helping Rwandan SMEs Talk to Their Customers Using AI Chatbots That Actually Work.,"Last month, I met a coffee shop owner in Nyamirambo who was drowning in WhatsApp messages.

“Every morning, it’s the same,” she told me. *“‘Do you have almond milk?’ ‘Are you open Sundays?’ ‘Can I pre-order?’… I love my customers, but I can’t reply to 200 messages before opening!”*

She wasn’t alone. Across Rwanda from logistics startups in Kigali to agri-businesses in Huye, SMEs are struggling with one thing: **being available**. Not just online, but *responsive*.

That’s where [Rask-D Technology Ltd](https://rask.co.rw)(yes, the team behind the technology[ ](https://rask.co.rw/)) stepped in not with another flashy app, but with something smarter: **real, practical AI chatbots built for Rwandan reality**.

# From “Talk to AI” to “Talk to My Business”

You’ve probably heard terms like **AI chatbot**, **chatbot AI**, or **AI chat GPT** but most of those tools are built for Silicon Valley, not Kimironko. They assume fast internet, credit cards, and English-only users.

Rask-D Technology took a different path.

Remember that coffee shop? Rask-D Technology built her a **WhatsApp-integrated AI chatbot** trained in both **Kinyarwanda and English** that answers FAQs, takes pre-orders, and even processes payments via **MTN Mobile Money**. No app download. No forms. Just chat.

And it’s not just her.

* A **fintech startup** in Kigali now uses an **AI chatbot online** to let customers check balances, request mini-statements, and report fraud all through WhatsApp.
* A **retail chain** deployed a **chatbot AI** on their website that guides shoppers to the nearest store, checks stock in real time, and sends SMS alerts when items are back in stock.

These aren’t sci-fi dreams. They’re live workflows built on **n8n automation** and fine-tuned LLMs designed *by Rwandans, for Rwandans*.

# Why This Isn’t Just “Another Chatbot”

Most **AI chat** tools fail because they’re generic. But Rask-D Technology's approach is different:

✅ **Local-first design**: Integrates with Mobile Money, WhatsApp, and local SMS gateways.  
✅ **Low-bandwidth friendly**: Lightweight, fast, and works on 3G.  
✅ **Human-in-the-loop**: If the AI gets stuck, it seamlessly hands off to a real person.

One client told me: *“Before, we lost 30% of leads because no one answered the website chat at night. Now, our AI greets them, qualifies them, and books a call for morning. Sales went up 22%.”*

# A Word of Caution (and Two Typos)

Of course, it’s not magic. You still need **clear intents**, good training data, and regular updates. And let’s be honest some early versions had… *issues*.

Like the time the bot told a customer their “*shippment*” would arrive “*tommorow*”… (yep, two spelling mistakes in one message 😅).

But that’s the beauty of working with a local team: they **fixed it in hours**, not weeks.

# Ready to Let Your Business Talk?

If you’re a developer, freelancer, or agency in Rwanda, consider partnering with or learning from what [Rask-D  Technology Ltd](https://rask.co.rw/) is doing. They even offer **micro-SaaS tools** like **Invoicer** for invoicing great for adding AI features without building from scratch.

And if you’re a business owner? Ask yourself: *What if your website, WhatsApp, or social page could answer questions while you sleep?*

Because in today’s market, **being silent = being invisible**.

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone here integrated an **AI chatbot** or **chatbot AI** into a client project in Rwanda? What worked? What bombed? Let’s share because our ecosystem grows when we do.",1,1760083838.0,webexpertfromrwanda,0,1.0,False

1o2v0yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o2v0yp/my_25f_boyfriend_24m_cheated_on_me_throughout_our/,My (25F) boyfriend (24M) cheated on me throughout our 4-year relationship,"Hi, I don’t know who else to talk to right now, so I’m putting this here.

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for almost four years. We’ve been long-distance for the past two, visiting each other every few months, though it’s been inconsistent. He’s always seemed like the most supportive, patient, and loving partner — or at least that’s what I believed.

We fought quite a bit, mostly over communication — he’d put his phone on Do Not Disturb for long periods and ignore my calls. I thought we were just going through normal long-distance struggles.
Recently, I found out that he’s been using Tinder and Bumble on and off for our entire relationship — not just once or twice like he first claimed, but for years. He paid for boosts and subscriptions, and he was also secretly spending money on OnlyFans. He told me he has a cuckold kink but was ashamed of it and didn’t know how to bring it up. When I found everything, he broke down crying, shaking, saying he was sorry, begging me not to leave, and telling me I’m the most important person in his life. But even after he said he wanted to be honest, I saw him going into the bathroom to delete emails while I was on his computer. I still found OnlyFans receipts he hadn’t wiped yet.

To make things worse, I had been helping support him financially — paying for his meals, his car insurance, his garage, his coffee — while he was secretly spending money on other girls online. It makes me feel used and incredibly stupid, even though he keeps saying none of this is my fault and that I didn’t deserve any of it.

Now that he’s been caught, he’s doing everything he can to win me back — cooking, cleaning, buying me food, doing everything I say, sharing all his passwords. He seems both sad and relieved, like he’s happy to no longer be hiding things. But I can’t stop asking myself: why couldn’t he do any of this before I found out?

Another thing that’s been bothering me — I found out he was watching content involving women who look like me and his ex. He claims it wasn’t because he misses her (they broke up six years ago), but that it was unconscious and stupid. Still, it feels like such a deep betrayal.

Our sex life was never great. I had pain during sex, so we didn’t do it much. He never pressured me and always told me he found me attractive — but emotionally, I felt like I was healing and falling more in love with him… only to find all of this out now.
Right now, I feel completely stuck. I can’t even leave him immediately even if I wanted to — I bought a non-refundable ticket to come visit him, and I’m not in my home country. He’s also supposed to attend my brother’s wedding with me, and he’s a groomsman. I just went on a trip with his mom and aunt, and it’s all too overwhelming to process or walk away from in this moment. Everything is so tangled and exhausting.

He says he wants to change. He seems genuinely sorry. He says he’ll do whatever it takes. But I’m completely lost. I don’t know if someone like this can truly change — or if I’m just holding onto a version of him that never really existed.

I know a lot of people will say I’m blind or foolish, but I guess what I’m asking is:
Is there any small chance he really means it and could change — or am I just dragging myself through more pain hoping for a person he’ll never be?

Any advice is appreciated.


TL;DR:
I (25F) have been in a 4-year long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (24M), whom I thought was loving and supportive. We had communication issues, but I chalked it up to long-distance struggles. Recently, I found out he’d been using dating apps and OnlyFans for most of our relationship, spending money on other women while I was helping support him financially. He admitted to having a cuckold kink he was ashamed to share. Even after claiming he wanted to be honest, he was still hiding things. Now that he’s been caught, he’s doing everything to win me back and seems both remorseful and relieved. I’m overwhelmed — I’m abroad visiting him, he's in my brother’s wedding, and everything feels tangled. I don’t know if he can truly change or if I’m clinging to a version of him that never existed.
Is real change possible here, or am I just setting myself up for more pain?",1,1760083759.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Two weeks ago I accepted a position at another company for significantly more money. I gave my standard two weeks notice and my boss seemed fine with it, said he understood.

Yesterday my boss introduced me to my replacement, ""Jessica"". He pulled me aside and asked me to spend my remaining time training her and getting her up to speed on all my projects and clients. Sure, whatever, that's normal.

Here's the problem: Jessica and I grabbed coffee to chat about the role, and she mentioned how excited she was about the salary. Then she told me the actual number. She's making $15k MORE than what I was making. For the same position. With less experience than me (she has 2 years in the field, I have 8).

Before she went she said with a smile Don't forget there are seasons to life but the happiness does not need to come solely from the seasons.

And there she was gone.I have no idea what but those words hit exactly the note where I was when they were said. I have been thinking about them each day since.

And as expected, the minister got slammed — accused of being insensitive to the Palestinian cause, for partnering with a coffee chain allegedly linked to Zionist Israel.

But here’s the truth: Starbucks has never directly funded the Zionist movement, and Starbucks Malaysia is 100% owned and managed by a local company.

Still, many Malaysians — especially the Muslim majority — have long believed otherwise. This perception has been ingrained for years, so even when facts are laid out, people find it hard to accept them.

That’s why we need a Tourism Minister who understands public sentiment, someone who’s smart enough to anticipate how every move might be perceived — not just by supporters, but by the whole nation.

This is exactly why we need a “Dream Team Tahan Lasak” — a resilient, professional team that can fight misinformation with facts, manage public perception with empathy, and serve as a real check and balance to the government.

Because without a team like this, every well-intentioned initiative will keep getting shot down by noise, narratives, and half-truths.",1,1760082713.0,Bolehland,0,1.0,False

This doesn't include the creamer cost, any taxes, and the fact that most coffee brand I found were easily above 50 cents per ounce also taking into account that 1:10 is a pretty generous ratio and some people do 1:4.

1o2uo1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o2uo1v/i_thought_id_be_different_when_i_was_elected/,I thought I'd be different when I was elected,"""I'm not going to be like the others""

That was how I ended every campaign speech when I was running for congress. Many people, including Chuck, my campaign manager would poke fun and laugh when I said that. ""Sure you aren't"", ""Give it a Week"", ""That's what they all say until that first questionable donation comes in"". But I meant it, and I think the voters could tell I meant it.

When I, as a 28 year old won my crowded primary and then in November the general election, I felt vindicated. My winning was proof that sometimes the Republic works, Democracy works, and someone who's not just a bought and paid for puppet for lobbyists.

The time between winning the election and being sworn in is like a blur. When you win a race, especially when its an upset race nobody thought you would win, you feel have everyone and their mother lining up to kiss the ring and try to apologetically beg for influence. Not to mention? The party had to get me prepped to actually be a congressman. We had to set up my office in district, get me up to date on what the party was doing. All of this was pretty much what I expected.

The first mistake that I made was pretty much as soon as I got to Washington, about 2 weeks before being sworn in. ( I know... this is stupid... but after a year of working my ass off, just me and Chuck, door knocking and phone calls, I was exhausted) was when the party offered me a slate of staff for my office. The majority Whip said ""Everyone on this list is pre-vetted and has the experience to help you hit the ground running"". I knew while signing their papers that these staff would probably expect me to play the games all these politicians play, but they were in for a surprise, I really am not going to be like the others.

I met Michael in my office the day after that, he was a tall blonde gentleman, with noticeably perfect posture.
""You must be my chief of staff"" I said.
He stood up from my desk and put out his hand gleefully. ""Yes sir! We have a hand full of meetings to get you to today."" He then handed me a paper, a schedule that had me working from the 5 AM news briefing to evening gatherings that stopped at 10 PM ""I know this schedule is packed he said, but you have a lot to get through these next few days, we have a welcome gathering of freshman at 8 PM tonight but before that we have a meeting with a couple of key lobbyists I have a good relationship with. ""

""I have to stop you right there"" I spoke up. ""I appreciate your getting this all together for me, but I ran on being different, I detest all of the backroom deals these lobbyists make, and when I say I'm going to be different, I mean it. 

Michael just grinned and assured me"" don't worry, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Its not like tv, sure these folks all want you to pass bills in their interest, but it's not like they're handing you a briefcase full of money."" I agreed to only meet with them as an introduction and made clear that I was not interested in any gifts or donations. I would come to find out, I was concerned about the wrong meeting.

The Freshman gathering was at a hotel across from the capital, it all felt terribly generic, suits and ties in one of those rented spaces with the pullout walls, they had those cocktails in those little plastic cups. The catering was done by hotel, the only reason I paid any attention at all to that was I found a couple of the waitresses to be attractive, and was kind of hoping to make conversation with the brunnete girl who was serving the drinks. The most striking thing was that it was bipartisan. It's funny, you see these guys tear each other apart on television, but the majority leader and minority leader were sitting at the same table and cracking jokes when just last week I was watching them on the news calling each other names that would get my post removed if I repeated them.

At about 9:30 I was looking to call it for the night, but Michael encouraged me to stay for the toast. One of the old senators stood up, the president pro-tempore, he had served his state since before I was born. I noticed that the staff switched out before they passed out the last round for the toast, the only reason I noticed at all was the brunnette girl was gone. The drinks they passed out were in the same little clear plastic cup, but instead of the punch from earlier, this appeared to be a thick red wine, it smelled like wine, bjt it's viscosity was way thicker, bjt it smelled okay. It wasn't until he toasted and I took a sip that I'd notice it tasted like wine mixed with iron.

I don't know what was in that drink, but I woke up st 5 AM in the next morning with a punding headache. I groggily got out of bed and ran to the restroom trying to remember the night before and count my drinks. When I stepped out again I noticed the hotel room was dark except the desk lamp was lite and a yellow manilla file folder sat on the table along with a headache powder and a steaming hot cup of coffee. A note was lying on top of the folder in incredibly precise and disciplined handwriting. It read ""You're just like the others"" ",1,1760082327.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

The idea came while traveling, since I wanted to know where other nomads were working from and connect with them. Google Maps shows cafés and coworking spaces, but it doesn’t tell you which ones are actually good for working — or if there are other nomads nearby. Also, I wanted an easy way to see all the locations I've worked from on my projects in a scratch map style - something like GitHub activity calendar but geo-based.

Main things I wanted to focus on:

✅ Discover popular places to work from

✅ Drop pins, customize them with icons, set visibility and organize them into different projects

✅ Promote your projects in a new way (for people building in cafés after their 9-5)

✅ Track countries you've worked from

✅ Connect with fellow nomads

My tech stack includes Flutter, Spring WebFlux, PostgreSQL, Auth0 & deployed with Docker on Hetzner VPS. I built the app in about 4 weeks in September and submitted it for RevenuCat's Shipaton hackathon. The idea was to build in public and compete in that category, but I only started posting after releasing the app. I've been relatively active on X, with little success. I also posted on couple of sites including HackerNews, ProductHunt, Reddit, PeerList, Aura++, ..

App is currently available for iOS only and you can check it out here [https://nomadmap.link](https://nomadmap.link/)

We fought a lot about mundane things, my questions and comments to the point where he got so angry he threw stuff around and started choking me. 

At the beginning of our relationship, we were truly happy. We spent a lot of time together, traveled, and enjoyed each other’s company. Later, we fell into a routine, and according to him, we became more like “flatmates” rather than a couple. He claimed that a relationship should always feel like a honeymoon, but I argued that it can’t be that way forever, because we live together with our jobs and everyday household chores. He works as a doctor, so I understand why he would come home tired after work and not want to do anything. Despite having free time and my encouragement to get out of bed, go for a walk in the city, or have lunch together, he refused, saying he just wanted to lie in bed. He spent a lot of time on his phone, and the communication between us started to fade. I don’t have many friends, so he was almost the only close person in my life (besides my parents). I didn't have anybody else to go out with, nor would I had wanted to, because that would've meant I'm having fun while my No.1 person in life is tired, sad and alone at home. This spring, he started going out to the city with his friends and wouldn’t invite me, so I stayed at home. At one point, he said he had met a new friend (Let's call him D he's 47M) at the gym, and they would sometimes go out for coffee together. That’s when the lying began. We could see each other’s locations, and sometimes he would lie about where he was, saying he was lying at home when in fact he was somewhere else. I didn’t confront him right away. There were many such lies — some of them perfectly crafted, with me in tears and him justifying himself by saying he didn’t want to tell me where he really was because he was afraid of my reaction, and that he just wanted to rest and recover from our complicated relationship.

I think I should also mention that over those 5 years we only had sex once. Normal anal sex. And even that was right before the breakup. And out of need, not love or lust. He argued that bottoming hurt just as much as topping, because he had a phimosis. For some reason I understood and justified it even though my need for more intimate intercourse was growing. We did have intimacy, we were sides. 

I remember it to this day when one sunday morning T suggested we take a walk to the city center, grab a coffee and a donut, but before that he'll go out with friends and come back home at 5PM. I waited, but when 5PM rolled around he wasn't home, so I packed my stuff and left on my own. Walking passed my house I saw a white car where two men were sitting: T and some other guy. My heart started racing as I didn't know what to think of it. He didn't come home, because he was sitting in a car with some guy, chatting. What about our date? I walked for a bit and tried calling him. He declined. Tears filled my eyes. I walked back to the car as he was getting out, we walked around the corner and I hit him twice in the chest and arm. I was so hurt from everything that had happened before and now this! When we got home I started shouting at him so hard my nose bled. Who was that man in the car with him? He told me it was his colleague from work, that just got divorced and needed someone to talk to.

Some time passed and one day I got home sooner than I should've. I found T and his new friend D at our place. They weren't in bed or anything, but they rushed out really quickly without T even saying goodbye. Once again I was both heartbroken and confused. When T came home he explained everything. D was his new love, but T also loves me. T told D that he was in a falling relationship and lived alone (even though I was living with him). He also told me that that day I passed them in the car, D asked ""why was that guy looking at us? Do you know him?"" And T answered ""yeah, he's a walking disaster"". Imagine hearing those words from a person you love. And after that D got angry with T for lying. Something worth mentioning - D is married and has two kids. This is his secret gay relationship.

After a while I calmed down and thought that everything was over between them. T and I had planned a trip to Sweden, maybe that could turn our relationship back to normal. Sadly, we fought a lot on that trip. That was the time he had sex with me out of need, so I stopped nagging him about it. We broke up after getting back home.

Now we live separately. We chat, we remained friends, he's still with D and is unhappy in that relationship also. He doesn't get the attention he craves, because D has a family which he loves, so he can't split with his wife. They meet up a couple times a week for a few hours. T mentioned that this new relationship feels painful, so he set an ultimatum - either D divorced his wife until november and they start a real relationship, or they break up.

Now, even though this sounds absolutely delusional, I still want T back. I love him. And everything about his current relationship gives me hope he'll come back to me one day. But after talking about it with him, he told me to hold no expectations and to live my own life.

I can't stop thinking about him. I want to be near him, hug him. I want us to try again. What do I do? How do I release him? Or should I hold on and hope that one day he'll come back?",2,1760081638.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False
1o2uhnq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2uhnq,Cigars of the week,"Juan Lopez Seleccion No.2: This was the most “a cigar” of anything Cuban I think I’ve had to date. It wasn’t offensive, it was just… there. No real changes in profile or transitions. Just a light tobacco throughout, much like a basic New World Connecticut. Not something to turn my nose up at, but I don’t need to come back to it again anytime soon. Paired with Coke Zero. Smoke time 1h20min.

Diplomaticos No.2: This one had some more character to it, in that it had some character to it. Chocolate, cream, and spiced but not spicy. Changes throughout were subtle but present, and the strength eased off in the middle third before coming back at times in the final third. It’s not a flavour profile I would need to come back to regularly and I think there’s a stock of other cigars I would want to try before returning to this, but if my Cuban tupperdor was well stocked with the “go to” cigars, I wouldn’t regret adding these to the stock for those occasions where I wanted something with this profile and in this size. Paired with sarsaparilla. Smoke time 1h20min. 

Partagas Serie D No.4: The classic of the Cuban cigar community. My expectations were high going in. Probably the best cold draw out of any of the cigars going in. A nice cream and leather combination at the start, which, as seems to be the trend, lightened up through the thirds. The leather tones changed into a leathery fruitiness as I continued, but not fruit, more like if you turned grape and berries into a jerky. Did it skyrocket to the top of my list as the community would suggest? No. Did I appreciate it and would I like more of them in the collection? Yes. Paired with Coke Zero. Smoke time 1h25min. 

Ramon Allones Specially Selected: Holy mother-of-coffee, Batman. A strong roast coffee bean out of the gate, which then saw creaminess added and mellowed out to more of an espresso. Nutty and chocolatey notes evolved in the second half, but still with the tannins of something roasted, like what you might expect if you set Nutella on fire. Which is all well and good if you’re into that profile. Unfortunately I’m not a fan of coffee flavours, so the charms of this one was lost on me. I will say that the quality of the draw was second only to the PDS4. Paired with Coke Zero. Smoke time 1h30min.

QOM Trainee Dommes Prank Sheila. Mary Supervises Her Slave Signing For Unpaid Internship And Character Rights To Mary. Humiliating Publicity Shoot-For Sheila.","
Nora's perspective 

So the publicity shoot for the Temporal Cold War Arc was fun. Well fun for everyone except Sheila (Giggle). We'd repurposed ASSHO's ""Battle Interface Chair"" To be Choejoe's inscribed with futuristic Korean calligraphy. She was to be in full costume, with her assets hanging out, masked and panel gagged of course. 

She was to be identified only as ""Mistress Mary's personal submissive and intern."" Also, we were confirming she was a Queen Of Mean Certified Quality Bottom Slave; and Mistress Mary was the domme credited with certifying her. We knew the pervs who memorized every inch of Sheila's body during her Loser Girl, Slavegaggers and Tres Bimbos De La Plastica shoots would light up fan forums with speculation. Her pretty, exotic curved hazel eyes would be a clue too. especially since they'd be narrowed with anger and humiliation, or wide with apprehension.

The day started early for Sheila, Sandy and Lara dressed her out in her Choejoe costume and handed her over to Mistress trainees Elena and Jillian. They'd started out professional, marching Sheila to the ""Choejoe's Comm and Recharging Station set without messing with her, simply making her stroll in the suit a step behind them, head and gaze slightly down, which is standard QOM protocol. It was noteworthy that even though they had her suit remote. They didn't  torment her. Not even zapping the well behaved slave by  using the remote on her buttplug.

The cameras showed they ordered her to sit in the chair, arms on each rest, Legs against the panel they'd be strapped to, back straight. They strapped her wrists to the armrests, her torso above and below her delicious half oriental breasts, Legs to each panel. They tested the straps for firmness but also comfort, even adjusting them after querying the ungagged Sheila about their tightness. She stared straight ahead with perfect discipline, not watching what they were doing or tugging her bonds like rookie slave. Of course, she was a well trained veteran, but I still felt a lot of pride in my beautiful slave friend.

They asked her if she needed to tell them anything else before they gagged her. When she said ""No Mistresses."" they strapped on her panel gag and inflated her mouth filler. Then they did one last maintenance diagnostic on her environmental and hydration systems.

Then things got a little sideways...Jillian turned to Elena and offered to buy her a coffee at the snack shack. Elena said yes, but asked ""We're never supposed to leave a slave alone, unless we inform security."" Suspiciously, she was smiling. They were both looking at Sheila like they were having the conversation for her benefit.

Sheila was staring at her two young Mistresses wide eyed, the trainee dommes could have reprimanded her. But they seemed to want her undivided attention to their conversation. Jillian said she already texted security and they'd only be twenty minutes.

Sheila's eyes narrowed, and she mmmphed an annoyed, unintelligible query at the two trainees. Jillian got a crooked smile ""Our coffee breaks are above your paygrade, slave. If you were getting paid, that is."" Both trainees started giggling.

Sheila mmmphed and glared. Jillian glared back, to Sheila's credit she met the dominatrix glare without flinching. Then, Elena held up the remote. ""I forgot to test the shock on your buttplug, want me to go ahead and do it now?"" Sheila's eyes got wide again.

She strained to beg coherently through her gag. ""Oh, ishwes, ease, ease, on't!"" Elena's little grin became a big smile. ""Then you'd agree, that your Mistresses' coffee break is none of your slave business?"" It was sad how almost pathetically eager my former mentor was to agree. ""Esh, ah agee, ishwess!"" Elena now looked with evil glee at the sub. ""Mary's really turning you into the perfect little brown noser, slave."" They chuckled when Sheila mmmphed desperately eager agreement.

""Come on, the slave will be alright, lets get a Java boost."" Jillian clapped Elena's shoulder. The set exit was directly behind Sheila's bondage chair. She turned her hooded head as much as she could to watch them leave. When she faced forward you could see the anxiety brimming behind her eyes. The seasoned veteran new the two rookie dommes were planning something. But as a restrained slave she could do nothing. Except peer nervously around the room, wondering if she could at least spot a clue to the prank so she wouldn't be suprised.

As we reviewed the camera footage in Dave's Office, I knew what was coming next. A building wide security alert drill. They were never announced ahead of time, so we were drilled to react if the real thing ever happened. Normally, only our big three would know, Dave, Constance, Lara, possibly Sandy or Mr. Ji, as they often did unofficial ""Senior Leadership"" duties off the set.

Sarah and I had been showering with Jasmine, but we were getting gooey and sticky faster than we were getting clean. We'd had a girl threeway in my room last night, to celebrate the kick off of the new story arc.  The alert at least brought us back to reality enough to clean up and get out, though after Sarah locked the door, we kind of just jumped into a naked girl pile on the bed, stil horny and giggling.

While we'd been nasty, playful lesbos, poor Sheila was probably terrified. As 
I watched her looking around frightened, I remembered the similar punishment prank I'd played on her and Layla months back. Poor Sheila, having to relive that.

She was keeping her cool, even though the powered doors on set hadn't clicked to lock, which should have happened if security had been properly informed. Sheila was refraining from crying out, knowing that would draw an active shooter and she was easy pickings. But as she looked around, obviously fighting rising panic, she had to know all her bare slave butt could do was sit there restrained, hoping for the best.

The free person who decided her fate was a new female security guard doing a sweep. She came in behind Sheila at the low ready with her pistol, letting out a yelp when she saw the hood masked submissive looking back at her wide eyed, to her credit, she didn't raise her gun.

She radioed in ""There's a submissive restrained on the Battle Chair set"" A pause ""Yeah, I think it's that Connor Chick."" I had to giggle at the ire in Sheila's glare over her shoulder at the young curly blond guard...Carson was her name...I think. Sheila hated being reminded how permanent her temporary demotion had become, like casual refrences to her as the ""Set Submissive"" or ""That Conor Chick"" by rank and file employees. To be fair, that is all newer employees like Carsons knew her as, to them her ""Boss Bitch"" days just an office legend.

Carsons came around to look at the security badge pinned above her right breast on her Choejoe suit. The badge's picture had her masked face, Mary's ""effort"" to keep her ""interns"" identity secret. More annoyance on Sheila's face as the guard read off the badge ""Slave Choejoe, QOM Intern, personal slave of Mistress Mary Williamson. Yep, I guess this is her."" Another pause ""Yeah, I can stay with her until the alerts finished."" I hear the click of the set doors locking.

Then she returned Sheila's irritated glare. ""What's your problem, Miss Full Frontal Gimp? Not my fault some dimwit left you here, we should have been informed.
And in the absence of one of your designated dommes, I do believe I'm in charge of you."" Sheila's eyes went from annoyed to nervous.

It was true, the rule as written for Sheila and Layla when they were clocked in as slaves was ""In the abscence of a designated Domme, Alpha Slave or other authority, any free employee, judged to be mature and responsible, can assume aithority over Slave Zero or Slave Border Bunny until a Designated Authority is available."" A security guard would presumably count as mature and responsible.

""So stop glaring at me, slave, as a matter of fact bow your head, now. If I have to babysit your dumbass, I don't want to look at your masked face, the janitors have more esteem than you, I don't need your disrespect."" Sheila bowed her head, quietly. She knew the rules, Security Guard Carsons was automatically her superior for the rest of the alert. Safe but still reminded she's a powerless slave during working hours, and the position's permanancy is cemented with each passing day.

Carsons followed Sheila's lowered gaze down to her lap. Then smirked. No doubt at Sheila's heart shaped pubic shave. Normally Sarah or I touched it up 
in my room weekly, giggling as we made her stand nude at attention, while we were at least minimally dressed. One of us shaves while the other stands by with a crop or flogger, mostly for show, Sheila's a good sport even though I know she hates the shave. But as long as we're her superiors and we think it's cute, she knows she has to accept it. We usually make it up to her with a little tag team muff diving afterwards.

But now it was just a source of amusementb for a new employee who only knew her as a  walking set dirty joke. ""Cute cut, slave, at least you have something nice to look at. You ought to have one of your girlfriends dye it with pride flag colors."" I thought it wasn't a bad idea, actually, though I disliked the guard's tone. Most everyone knew all of the Perseverance girls were dykes or bi-sexual, wasn't a big deal to most, except a few closet homophobes. Carson kind of sounded like she might be one of said phobics.

Sheila shifted a little, probably flushing under her suit, but kept her head bowed in obedience. The guard smirked, dragged up a folding chair and positioned it for the clearest line of fire between Sheila and the door, then holstered her pistol, sat down, and waited, stony faced, though occasionally smirking at her charge.

Dave stopped the playback and looked at each of us gravely. Constance, Lara, Sandy, Jasmine, Mr Ji and myself. ""Where is the Sla-Sheila now?"" Dave winced, as the rest of us looked on sympathetically. We all had to struggle with using Sheila's name in private, to remind ourselves she's our friend, just roleplaying as our slave. Ji gave his friend an understanding pat on the shoulder.

""I assigned her to help the QOM Alpha slaves clean their lounge. Sarah volunteered to be her direct Alpha durin the field day."" Nods of approval all around. Sarah would make sure QOM's Alpha Slaves didn't make Sheila do all the work, then take all the credit and denigrate her as a lazy bottom slave. She'd be working hard under Sarah's supervision, her work still subject to the former Navy Officer's exacting attention to detail, enforced by harsh ass chewings, and rarely the swat of a crop or flogger, though Sarah hated using corporal punishment on her best friend. But Sarah would work just as hard right next to her, and make sure QOM's ambitious, sometimes weasly minions treated her fairly. So far Sarah's leadership of Sheila and QOM's Alpha Slaves had brought her high praise from Mistress Stacy Kealoha.

Dave nodded, relieved Sheila was in good hands. Constance spoke up ""Mistress Mary assures me both young dommes are getting butt chewings, and one more screw up puts them back at bottom slaves for a year. And they'll be made available as Slave Extras for the Perseverance under the direct supervision of Mistress Nora."" Now Mr. Ji clapped my shoulder. ""Considering your ferocious reputation as a domme, young lady, I doubt we'll have any more trouble from them. Everyday I'm impressed at how far you've come, my youthful friend. And your star is still rising."" I grimned at the Handsome Korean guy's praise.

Nods from all my friends that they agreed, which made me glow inside. Then Dave spoke up with a frown...""Didn't they text security?""

Lara spoke now, an edge of anger at the unnecessary humiliation and possible danger her love Sheila was put in. ""They did, the problem is they didn't wait for an acknowledgement before they left. Those little bitches signed a form that they knew and would abide by that and all our precautions for subs. I'm glad Mary's handling this...I'd..."" She trailed off dangerously, Sandy squeezing her shoulder to calm her.

Dave smoothly injected ""I suspect they used our unofficial ""one mistake"" policy to prank Sheila, though there must have been a leak about the drill, I'll call a meeting with the Security Department when we break from the publicity shoot to address it. As for the young dommes I hope they enjoyed their ""Gag"". One more and they'll be wearing gags under your whip, young lady."" A small smile and nod that made me so wet. Sandy was so lucky to snag the sexy old fox!

Sandy's annoyed voice came through next. ""I didn't like how personal and disrespectful that Security bitch got with Sheila. She had a right to order Sheila to stop glaring and bow her head. Comparing her to the Custodians, making personal cracks about her sex life and partners, calling her a ""gimp"", were uncalled for.""

Dave looked around. ""Anyone disagree with Sandy, speak up now."" No one did, Carsons was way more personal and disrespectful than the situation warranted.

Dave nodded again. ""Young Miss Carsons will have a suprise meeting tomorrow morning with me, Constance and Lara tomorrow, you too, Sandy. We'll gently remind her that subs are treated with a minimum of personal respect on this set. And remind her the slave she disrespected is probably the reason this set is here for her to get a job on."" I looked around at my castmates and friends, everyone seemed satisfied the saucy young guard would be handled.

""Alright, Lara, go ahead and pull Sarah and Sheila from cleaning the Alpha Slave Lounge. I suspect under Sarah's lead, and with both their work ethics, it's mostly done. If not, we're doing then a favor loaning them our slaves, especially after what their two trainee dommes did today.
Let Sheila take off the suit hood mask and shut down all the discipline functions. She can relax in your apartment Lara. I don't want to leave her alone, though, the humiliation of being Mary's unpaid intern is obviously troubling her, as is knowing her identity will leak, eventually.""

We were assured by Sheila and her therapist she wasn't suicidal. But Sheila had a lot of anxiety and suppressed fears from her time with Ari. Even her gentler servitude surrounded by friends could give her flashbacks and make her act erratic...us talking to her, eating together and watching movies did a lot to reassure her she was still our friend, she was just playing our slave.

The problem is Constance, Lara, Sandy, Sarah and myself would all be busy leading up to the shoot. Then Layla spoke up ""I'm not doing much as a furloughed slave. I already memorized my lines Mistress Nora. I'll do it."" I inclined my head. ""Thank you, Slave Border Bun....Layla."" 

Jasmine piped up ""Me too. I memorized my lines, and I'm not doing admin like you guys. Plus, I love Sheila and Layla's funny stories about the First Season! Uh, if that's okay with you, Border- ur, Layla.""
Layla gave her a hard stare for a moment, making Mistress Jasmine squirm a little. Then she held out a hand and smiled.

""I'd be honored, thank you Mistress Jasmine."" Jas took her hand, looking relieved. ""Please just call me Jas when we're off the clock. Sheila can too, of course."" Layla nodded and released her firm Marine grip. Jas tried not to wince. Layla doesn't try to crush people's hands, she's not that petty. But she had a naturally firm grip.

""Alright Ladies, fall out, lets get this done.""
We all broke off to prepare for the shoot.

Sheila's Perspective-Just before the Afternoon publicity shoot.

I'm kneeling, squatting on my bare heels to the left of Choejoe's ""Battle Interface Chair"" in my humiliating costume, my hands resting on my thighs, palm up. My bare nipples are uncomfortably stiff from the air conditioning, and my booted heels are starting to poke uncomfortably at my bare bum. Still I strive to maintain the approved ""waiting"" posture of a QOM Bottom Slave for her Mistress.

Mary wanted to go over the release for the shoot, since my bare breasts and snatch would be in the shot. Also remitting my payment for the shoot to ""Mistress Mary"" for being my Mentoress during my internship. Bitch literally gave herself that title on my paperwork. She sure loves her titles.

We could have easily done this in a respectful setting as equals. Dave would have made her, if she hadn't invoked the clause that made me a QOM Intern thanks to my Bottom Slave certification. She didn't owe me an explanation, of course. But she let me know she was doing it this way as remedial bottom slave training for me in respecting my superiors.

Speak of the she devil, in she walks. Standard QOM Domme uniform, Black Thigh high boots, black skirt, black blouse with silver studs, her blond hair tied up in a severe bun. She acts like she's preoccupied with the tablet in her hand. But a brief glance over it tells me she expects her greeting.

I'm ungagged, so I belt out ""Greetings, Mistress Mary, this unworthy slave is eager to-mmmmoooph!"" She holds up the remote she just used to inflate my gag without warning. ""Stow it, Brown Noser, your servile blather is distracting me from important matters."" Her tone sounds dismissive, but her twinkling eyes say her cruelty was calculated, not casual.

She sits in the chair as I stare straight ahead sullenly. ""This chair feels more comfortable than when we used it for Sarah. Your pals are really trying to ease this for you. Well, can't blame them for trying."" I can't turn my head, but I sense her nasty grin on me. The subtext is clear, she's going to use her position to make me as uncomfortable as possible.

She leaves me to sit in silence for a few minutes. Than she says ""Alright, dear, move freely but stay on your knees, I need you to sign a few things."" I'm wearing the black latex suit gloves that give me decent dexterity, when the suit isn't frozen in lock mode. I turn to take the pad and stylus from her, then look at the first line.

""The Intern consents to have her exposed breasts, vagina and anus photographed and published for the shoot."" My ass, but I'm going to be sitting on it! I turn to Mary questioningly, even though I can't speak with the gag at maximum inflation.

Even without words Mary knows my issue. She gives a put upon sigh, like it's a burden to explain everything to her stupid intern. ""It's just a standard clause, you know that, Sheila, now hurry up and sign, okay?"" Her voice is coaxing, but her eyes flash menance. I meet her gaze for one second to let her know she doesn't scare me, even in her superior position. Then I turn back to the tablet and sign. Afraid or not, no point in antagonizing the woman who can literally control my speech and movement right now.

Looking over as I sign, Mary beams ""Good Girl! Now scroll down."" Standard stuff, signing my payment over to my Mentoress, and other administrative crap made more complicated by my being a Queen Of Mean intern for this episode instead of a Perseverance employee.

The last clause does make me hesitate ""The Intern signs over all credits, rights, income and future royalties to her Mentoress Miss Mary Willismson. The Intern acknowledges she has no right to credit or benefits associated with present or future appearances of the Choejoe character.""

Okay, I shouldn't be so pissed off. The character wasn't even my idea, which really would have stung. It was Mistress Nora's idea, and I know she probably intended it to be a humiliation for me. (Stop getting wet at the thought, not now! I tell my traitor snatch silentlya) She probably wanted to bring a domme in, credit her for the voice, maybe even have her domme me (My nipples get a little stiffer with arousal, not cold, at the thought). I could have played along, even enjoyed it for one episode.

But I could easily guess Mary guilt tripping everyone about stealing ""her show"", leaving her penniless and humiliated; and how giving her this was minimum compensation. And she had a point, her treatment by Dave, Layla, Nora and myself was not fair, in hindsight. 

But dammit, I'm going to suffer and be humiliated in this suit, all the pervs who loved Loser Girl, then flocked to Slavegaggers and the Three Plastic Bimbos, would recognize my body, and dox me humiliatingly.

I could do it for one episode to pay Mary back. But I know Mary is going to try to make Choejoe a permanent antagonist. Which means I'm her slave for half a season or more. Just being her slave for short periods makes me emphathize with Sarah. I don't want to be Mary's new grudge whipping girl.

I feel a light tug on my ponytail, not enough to hurt, just annoying. I turned to glare at my Mentoress, wanting to throw aside the tablet and stylus and belt her one. She smiles and holds up the suit remote, as if daring me to try. I take as deep a breath as I can in this stupid hood mask and relax.

""I know what's bothering you, sweetie. Now you know how I felt, except I had it worse. YOUR writing made a mockery of my character and threw her aside, just because YOUR writing made Nora's character more popular. You're both paying me back. Nora's writing me a knew character, and your paying the much deeper debt you owe me by doing all the heavy lifting."" She sighed and shifted tacks.

""One episode, Sheila. You know you owe me that, at least. I could whip the brattiness out of you, I know how to break you now. But whatever you think of me, I'm not that much of a sadist. So how about a little cooperation and this will go much easier for both of us? Okay?"" She gave me an ingratiating smile, even held up the remote and deflated my gag. A show of good faith.

That I didn't trust. But, I didn't really have a choice at this point. ""Yes, Mistress Mary."" I stated, the the gag bladder taste still in my mouth. I turned, signed away all character rights, and handed the tablet and stylus back to Mary. ""Good girl!"" She praised chirpily. She put the tablet and stylus aside.

""Almost time for the shoot, dear. Let's get you up, strapped in and ready."" I took her proffered hand and she stood while gently helping me up and into the chair. As she started strapping me in, I silently hoped Nora closed Choejoe's story out in this epidode, and there was no convincing way to bring the villaness back. Mary's contented humming as she put on my restraints indicated she has other plans...

Mary's perspective

I get Sheila all snug and strapped in, just as her friends march in. All in Stellar Compact Uniform. Constance gives me a warm shake, harkening back to our time as roomates when we were QOM bottom slaves. At the same time she orders Nora and Jasmine to check Sheila's bonds. Both girls nod to me as they pass. Sarah and Lara give me curt greetings of '""Hi, Mary."" Sheila's Best Friend and Lover, understandably not thrilledpp with me, they know it's personal between me and Sheila, and don't like the power dynamic.

I walk up to Ji, who is awkwardly trying not to look at Sheila's lovely body. I give him a playful hip bump and go ""Hey, stranger, long time."" Ji and I were friends ever since I started dating Dave, we went back. But he was good friends with Sheila, too, being her chess opponent after hours during the First Season. So the tension between me and my sub put him in a difficult position.

Still, he tried to be polite, clasping my hand warmly. ""Good to see you, young lady! Glad to see you're doing so well, now!"" I wink and nod at my bound subbie. ""We can all thank Sheila for our fame."" He releases my hand and looks grave trying to decide on a response.

""Don't you forget it, Williamson!"" I turn to see Layla glaring at me in her Sci-Fi Marine Uniform. The hottie little Taco Dyke herself. Unbound and not under submissive rules for this episode. Even if she was it probably wouldn't stop her, to be honest.

""I never saw one script that you wrote. I've heard you talk shit in the QOM compound that Sheila winged it on scripts. At least she turned in good ones that made this show a hit! I saw the first couple of episodes you wrote, a twenty year old hackpp porn stringer could have done better! Fans still laugh at how much the quality improved when she took the wheel!""

The little Border Hopper is trying to bait me. But one thing I learned as a QOM domme is you never lower yourself to argue with a slave. ""Layla, dear, you look so good in uniform! I'm sure you'll turn in your usual splendid performance. Just be sure you turn in the same performance when I put you in the Pinata bitchsuit for Queen Of Mean's birthday party next week! QOM is so excited to paddle your cute brown butt cherry red, it'll be the only thing sticking out!""  The former Jarhead Dyke looks ready to hit me. Not sure I could take her, but I'm not backing down from a slave I helped certify.

Constance saves the day ""Ladies, Ladies! Enough! Act like professionals, we're all colleagues. Leave your differences off this set. Agreed?"" I smile and say ""Of course, Constance.""

Layla looks chagrinned. ""Sorry, sweetie."" She says to Constance. The hot black domme kisses her Hispanic lovers cheek. ""No apology needed, Sugar. Just keep it respectful, and remember Mary is still technically your Mistress."" Layla glares at me. ""I'll remember."" The words sound concillatory, the voice tight. I do what any decent domme would do, turn my back on her like she's nothing.

The arrival of the photography crew forestalled further conflict. The first few shots were the crew together in uniform, Nora at the center as Captain Gail. Me and subbie Sheila excluded. Then one with me in the picture with them, caption reading ""An old castmate returns, again.""

One by myself, smiling, with a two hand grip on my riding crop out in front. Second shot me standing next to to the chair, smiling hand resting on a sullenly glaring Sheila's shoulder. ""Mary Williamson breaks in a new intern to do  the hard work.""

Third shot, me to the right of the chair, gazing down at the slave, smiling predatorily and fingering my crop. Sheila's head is turned, gazing at me wide eyed. Caption: ""The Intern isn't sure what she's gotten into with ""Captain Rommie"" as her Mistress.""

Next shot was Nora, in front of her, balancing the crop horizontally on the tops of Sheila's nipples, glaring menacingly in the sub's wide eyed face. Caption ""Captain Dora Gail, Star of the show, letting the Intern girl know there will be no malingering on her show.""

Then one of Nora and I fist bumping in front of the sub's face, her eyes mad. Caption ""Mary and Nora show the sub their Domme Solidarity to keep her in line.""

Then one of Sarah standing in front of the chair, hands on hips, glaring at the wide eyed Sheila skeptically. Nora to the right, me to the left, very obviously smothering laughter. ""ASSHO is skeptical the new set sub and Intern can fill her old chair.""

The next one is me with my arm around Nora to my right, Sarah to my left, Sheila's subbie butt excluded. caption ""Captain Rommie is proud how much her girls have grown since the First Season."" After the shot I grinned at a glaring Sheila. Even without seeing the caption yet, she knew the shot was me pushing her out of her ""Set Mother"" role, at least in the perception of the fans. Which mattered most for this show.

The next shot is the three of us toasting with glasses of Champagne in front of Sheila's aggravated eyes. The bottle of Champagne is on the seat between her legs. ""The Original Three toast to the success of the new story arc, and to set an example of success for the new Intern on how far a submissive can go.""

I giggle to myself. When fans figured out who Sheila was, the forums would be full of jokes that Sheila was setting an example. How far a former Chief Screenwriter and Top Domme can fall. When her eyes catch mine, I smirk, knowing she already knows.

The last shot is a suprise...for Sheila! It is the Luck Of The Full Moon Shot! Can you guess?

Sheila looked confused when I unstrapped her. I order her to turn around, bend over, and I'd reverse strap her wrists to the chair arms. She hesitates, not out of bafflement, but because she realizes what is planned.

Before I could sharpen my request, Nora yells. ""That isn't a request, slave! Do it now!"" I had the suit's autoshock punishment routine on, and Sheila gasps a scream as her ass, tits and clit get a jolt. I reinflate her gag. She is already getting up and turning, her conditioned fear of Nora's anger as well as the shocks putting her on slave autopilot. Nora motions Jasmine to Sheila's right, as I move to her left. Together, we strap her wrists down, as I make her bend low and spread her legs as wide as she can. Then I lock the suit in place with the remote.

We gather around for the final shots around Sheila's ass, all of us. The caption is ""The New Intern provides her lucious Full Moon to ensure the success of the production. With that ass she's going to go far!"" Perfect crowning humiliation! For now.

Constance announces ""Everyone break for the launch party, we're going in costume, so try not to get them to messy. Mary, are you coming?""

""Yes. I'm just waiting for Elena and Jillian to come supervise our Intern's script study."" A baleful look from the voluptous ebony domme at the mention of those two.

""Don't worry, Connie, after I chewed their cute butts, I let them know Mistress Nora is eager for two new subs if they screw up again. They've seen her domme Sheila amd Layla and heard my stories, trust me, they'll behave.""

All the cast, except Nora, stops to pat Sheila and whisper something reassuring. I am suprised even Jasmine seems sincere, when she usually made a point of looking down on Sheila and Layla for being submissive. The Perseverance softies are getting to her. Speaking of which, Miss Big Booty Latina tries to stare me down on her way out.

I wink and smile, which makes her angrier. Constance grabs her shoulder and gets her to turn around and leave. I picture her folded up bitch suit style in a pinata, her bare ass red and swollen from getting caned. It's a silly multicolored donkey with a sombrero and a stupid grin. It flips open to insert a bitch suited sub, the flips closed. She'll becompletely encased except for her bare, plugged ass. We'll see how tough you are then, baby dolly.
 
When her friends have all left, Nora strides up to Sheila's bare ass and gives it a whack. ""Behave for Mistress Mary from now on, or you might find that Choejoe has a long story arc. Maybe even to the series finale. Understood?"" The little blond terror's former role model mmmphs ""Ess ishwess ora!"" obviously terrified by the idea.

She rests her hand on Sheila's ass, gently stroking it. She suprises me with a knowing wink. I wink back, not wanting to seem like I missed the message. Nora nods to me and leaves.

Was Nora onboard with Choejoe being a recurring character? Oh please, I hope so! I always thought her friends would be an obstacle, but if I could keep Sheila in the costume for more than one episode, that would be awesome! Was she serious about all the way to the series finale? Sheila projected six when we first started getting popular. Both Nora and Lara think four, maybe five max before we start losing fans. Two and a half seasons of publicity, paychecks and Sheila as my slave! When I got through with her she'd be typecast as a sub if she stayed in the fetish business! Just in case Nora granted my wish, I decided to start working on ways to trap Sheila into doing seasons of work as my prop. Probably have to start giving her a stipend...which I can tax heavily for ""production expenses"". I remind myself not to count my chickens to soon. Even if I only get one episode to make this snippy bitch miserable, it's worth it!

1o2uerx,https://i.redd.it/aeabzd59l8uf1.jpeg,I spent 3 hours making a reel that 12 people watched. 7 of them were my own replays.,"In a small, sunlit studio, a graphic designer named Mia was hunched over her computer, surrounded by a whirlwind of sticky notes, coffee cups, and endless color swatches. She had an important project due tomorrow, but instead of diving into the content, she found herself trapped in an emotional tug-of-war with her fonts.

""Should the title be in bold or italic? What if I used a softer serif instead of this one?"" Mia pondered, clicking back and forth between options like a moth drawn to a flickering flame. For hours, she adjusted spacing, danced with color contrasts, and meticulously aligned every element on her design canvas. But with each tweak, she felt a growing sense of frustration mixing with the satisfaction of crafting something perfect. 

“Okay, just one more adjustment,” she told herself yet again as she zoomed in for the umpteenth time to inspect pixel perfection. Time slipped away like grains of sand through her fingers, and suddenly it was past midnight. She sighed, realizing she’d spent three hours on something that should have taken thirty minutes.

As she looked at the clock, exhaustion washed over her. “Why do I keep doing this?” she thought, aware that she was a prisoner to her own striving for perfection.

That's when an idea struck her: what if she could cut down the endless fiddling? After some quick searching, Mia stumbled upon editable templates online. She clicked through them, intrigued by the promise of quick customization with all the design choices already made for her. 

“That’s it!” she exclaimed, finally grinning at the prospect of freedom from her design dilemmas. 

With a few simple adjustments, she completed her project in just 10 minutes – not 3 hours. 

And so, she liberally linked her revelation in her next blog post, sharing with others drowning in design prison: ""That's why I started using editable templates. 10 minutes, done. Not 3 hours. Linked it here if you’re tired of design prison.""

1o2u9j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_khushi-aggarwal/comments/1o2u9j2/what_are_some_morning_habits_that_can_change_your/,What are some morning habits that can change your day?,"I used to think mornings didn’t matter much. I’d snooze my alarm, rush through a cup of coffee, scroll through my phone, and run out the door feeling already behind. But one day, after reading an article on ***The Executive Outlook*** about productivity and mindset habits of top leaders, I decided to experiment with my mornings and it completely changed how I experience the day.

Here’s what I discovered: mornings are more than just a routine, they set the tone for everything that follows. Here are a few habits that made a real difference for me:

**1. Start with gratitude, not your phone**  
Instead of immediately checking messages, I spend two minutes reflecting on things I’m grateful for. It could be as simple as a warm bed, a supportive colleague, or the chance to try something new today. It instantly shifts your mindset from reactive to positive.

**2. Move your body, even a little**  
I’m not talking about an intense workout, just stretching, a short walk, or a few yoga poses. It wakes up your body and mind, and makes you feel energized without caffeine.

**3. Journaling or planning your top 3 priorities**  
I write down three things I want to accomplish that day. It keeps me focused and gives me small wins to celebrate. *The Executive Outlook* often emphasizes how successful leaders use clarity in the morning to shape productive days.

**4. Mindful consumption**  
I avoid social media and news first thing. Instead, I read an inspiring article, listen to a short podcast, or spend a few minutes learning something new. Feeding your mind positively before distractions makes a huge difference.

**5. Hydrate and fuel wisely**  
Water, a healthy breakfast, or a nutrient-rich smoothie, it sounds basic, but starting the day with care for your body affects energy, mood, and focus.

Since I started these habits, my mornings feel intentional. Even on challenging days, I feel more in control, more focused, and more present. What amazed me most was how small changes created a ripple effect: better decision-making, calmer interactions, and more creativity.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that mornings aren’t just hours, they’re the foundation of your day. Treat them with care, and the rest of the day often takes care of itself.",1,1760080697.0,u_khushi-aggarwal,0,1.0,False

Booked flights in a recent Jetstar sale in and out of Tokyo for next May. It will be my 4th trip to Japan (18 years since my last trip!), but my partner and kids first trip. We have 2 boys who will be 6 and 10 when we travel. We are from Australia so shouldn't have jet lag being only 1hr difference in time. Kids are early risers so hopefully that plays to our advantage in being able to avoid some crowds. Kids enjoy train / public transport travel.  
  
I initially included Kyoto as it is one of my favourite places in Japan and I want the family to see Japan beyond Tokyo. However considering the families interests and must-do's (ninja (*6 year old really wants to go to ninja school!!*), volcanoes, Ghibli, craft, castles, sumo, robots, Hokusai, Kusama, good coffee, nature, architecture and design), I have developed the following:  
  
**Day 0** \- Arrive Narita 5:45pm   
*Tokyo O/N*  
**Day 1** \- Free explore Tokyo sensory overload spots - Shinjuku etc. Maybe catch Metro building evening lights   
*Tokyo O/N*  
**Day 2** \- Asakusa + Sumo lunch experience + Hokusai Museum (playground opposite for kids to burn off any energy)  
*Tokyo O/N*  
**Day 3** \- TeamLab Planets (+ Odaiba area - miraikan)  
*Tokyo O/N*  
**Day 4** \- DisneySea   
*Tokyo O/N*  
**Day 5** \- Ghibli Museum (pending tickets!) + Inokashira Park + Kichioji   
*Tokyo O/N*  
**Day 6** \- Hakone Loop & Yunessun (open until 7 being wknd)   
(Hakone Free Pass)  
*Hakone O/N*  
**Day 7** \- Open Air Museum. Travel to Nagano PM. Zenkoji.   
(Activate JR East Nagano Niigata 5 Day Pass)  
*Nagano O/N*  
**Day 8** \- Togakushi. Ninja School + Shrine + Lake.   
If up to it in afternoon Obuse for chestnut ice cream  
*Nagano O/N*  
**Day 9** \- Day Trip to Matsumoto. Castle + Art Gallery + Frog Street  
*Nagano O/N*  
**Day 10** \- Day Trip to Takasaki. Daimonya Daruma painting workshop and Daruma-ji  
*Nagano O/N*  
**Day 11** \- AM Shinkansen to Tokyo. Luggage in Lockers and final explore / shop. Be on the N'EX by 4pm for 9pm flight.  
  
Thoughts?   
  
I like that this takes me to a couple of places I haven't been - Togakushi, Matsumoto and Takasaki. Torn a bit about leaving Kyoto out, however I know everyone will love Japan, so figure we can just save for a second trip that is Kansai focussed. ",1,1760080373.0,JapanTravelTips,1,1.0,False

Probably clicked on one while doom-scrolling at night because it had a pretty picture or something...

1. I love cooking, but use a single 10-year-old $10 dollar knife that I bought from some random supermarket \*for everything\*. Never sharpened it. Cuts onions just fine, but struggles with stuff like fish skin.
2. I live a 30-minute ride away from Sakai in Japan, and even near my home there are several establishments selling knives for professionals made there.
3. I have in the past 20 years dived into all sorts of suddenly-expensive hobbies  -- coffee, cameras, whisky -- and have learned multiple times that the bell curve meme of amateur-enthusiast-veteran (mobile phone camera -> $7000 of gear in a backpack -> mobile phone camera) is very real, making me pretty damn hesitant in finding another well to throw my money into.

But what the hell. Could someone suggest a phenomenally good brand for a santoku type kitchen knife that I might go looking for? I already know I wouldn't be sharpening it daily, so I'm thinking something double-edged that will hold its edge well.

Months later I peeked just out of boredom and saw those same pins still sending people my way. I hadn’t logged in forever. Felt like finding cash in old jeans, but online.

Medium did the same thing. I tossed a couple posts about what I was messing with on Etsy, nothing polished, didn’t share them anywhere. They somehow kept getting read. Every few weeks I’d get a tiny “you got paid” ping and just laugh.

Etsy kept doing its own thing too. Some listings with reviews kept selling. Even old trend stuff I swore was dead still sold a few here and there. Phone goes cha-ching while I’m half-asleep, still one of my favorite sounds ever.

And the nerdy bit: I figured out a way to get my old pages showing up on Google again faster. Nothing fancy, just me tinkering too much. But it worked. That slow drip of visitors never really stopped.

1o2twqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1o2twqv/need_protein_powders_i_didnt_like_pescience/,Need protein powders (I didn’t like PEScience),"Hey guys, For some reason I I don’t like some of the “goated” mainstream protein powders.

I was so addicted I would just us water + ryse protein powder and that would be enough, however addictions slowly fade away and you start cravings some luxurious tasting stuff.

**What I love but now kind of bored of:**

* Ryse protein (Chocolate cookie blast, Peanut Butter cup, Cosmic Brownie), I have eaten 6 pints per day of these for about a year. Served me well
* Ghost whey (Slowly hated the chip’s ahoy, noticed it wasn’t rly my cup of tea, I loved the Coffee Ice cream)
* Muscle Sport Lean Whey (overall I did not mind the flavors, I can finish a tub even tho it wasn’t my favorite flavor)
* PandaSupps (I like their formulations but need to find the perfect flavor, ordered some more)

**What I tried and rly tried to love but couldn’t:**

* PEScience, I tried so many times and so many flavors, they just never hit home for me. (chocolate truffle, CnC was very cream heavy)
* 1up, their protein powders were rly cream flavor heavy
* Axe and Sledge (C&C, Chocolate macadamia)
* Legion (Salted caramel, dutch chocolate)
* Transparent labs (used to love their dark chocolate but flavor was too mild after a while)
* Myprotein (Several chocolate flavor, salted caramel)
* Jocko Molk (chocolate, didn’t mind it but didn’t topple ryse, wasn’t worth it for me)
* Applied Nutrition (Choco Beuno, White choco Beuno)
* Isopure (chocolate)
* Clean Simple Eats (brownie batter)
* Dymatize (Cocoa Pebbles, flavor weren’t rly strong for me)
* Ekkovision (Tiramisu, Brownie batter)
* Fairlile milk + vanilla extract was abysmal IMO

**Btw: this has been a very expensive trial and error but worth it.**

**Final notes:**

It sounds like I am a pain to recommend to, hopefully someone as messed up as me can be helped.

As you notice I am chocolate heavy advocate, Idm a vanilla here and there if it’s amazing, lean whey and panda supps vanilla are great.

**Flavors I despise, (or maybe haven't tasted good one):**

* I don’t like mint (non-negotiable)
* pure peanut butter flavored
* fruity/cream heavy flavors as you see. For example strawberry shortcake by ryse was more cake/cream than pure strawberry.

**Possible flavor/goals:**

* I guess the best case scenario for me would be a great vanilla which I think I have, but have never found a good salted caramel (awaiting my panda supps order)
* Also Biscoff (cookie butter)
* But as you see I like chocolate, chocolate hazelnut, Ferraro Roche/Nutella vibes

I get tempted to re-order most protein I don’t like from the sheer positive reviews they get.

**Attempts:**

I have tried normal cacao, very expensive dutch powders, black cacaos and expensive vanilla bean extracts. They all just try and mask the protein flavor and are dominant, I don’t like the intense dry pure cacao flavor 

For example when I use a 1Tbsp of Dutch chocolate it overrides any flavor and I just taste that powder, it doesn't seem to blend, just overpower. If i use too little, I can't even sense it's there.

I like rich/luxurious gelato/Haagen-Dazs/Lindt vibes.

Sorry for the long post. I hope I am not being annoying and hope someone can help me out 😭.

Edit: I don’t mind other solutions as well, anything that would work and is not a calorie bomb.

And every minute you spend you just becoming even more stressed. And the part of being a great man is to do focused work everyday so you get results you need.

I know this feeling because it happened to me many times and I decided to do something with it.

What helped me was:

1. Clean your desk of EVERYTHING you don’t currently need. Keep only your PC equipment, water/tea/coffee, notebook and a pen.
2. Write down all tasks that needs to be done generally in the notebook in front of you or in Note Taking App
3. Look at single point at a specific distance for 60 seconds - it engages prefrontal cortex and increases your focus.
4. Write down 1 thing you will focus on for the next 30 minutes
5. Play focus music with no vocals. I personally like to use BrainFM app.
6. Set a timer for 30 minutes and keep it visible the whole time you will be working.
7. Work on the thing for next 30 minutes.
8. Take 5-10 min break
9. Repeat the Cycle of steps 4-8 multiple times

I’ve been here five years, and it feels like I’ve been stuck in *pause mode* the whole damn time. Can’t afford to move. Can’t seem to get out of my own way. Can’t even find a job because apparently being an old white guy with too many opinions isn’t a “growth industry.”|
|And yet… I’m still here.|
|That’s the part that gets me.By all logic — and I mean *by all logic* — I shouldn’t be.I’ve been through thirty-one, maybe thirty-three, situations that could’ve — and by all accounts, should’ve — killed me. But here I am. Bruised, bent, not even close to enlightened, but still breathing.|
|Call it God, call it angels, call it the poor bastards on spiritual overtime keeping me alive — someone up there clearly isn’t done laughing at me yet.|
|Lately, though, I been thinking, thinking hard…demotivated, lazy, living in nostalgia, fucking fed up with my reality…Literally, sitting around waiting to die.Too much coffee. Too much cheap beer when I can afford it. Too much thinking, not enough doing. I love to cook, but only when I’m cooking for others. When it’s just me, it’s toast, eggs, and the kind of bachelor meals that would make Gordon Ramsay file a restraining order.|

|I’ve lived hard. Fought harder. Done stupid shit that makes great stories but terrible life choices. I’ve rebelled, I’ve run, I’ve lost, I’ve laughed, and somewhere between the chaos and the comedowns, I learned that humor is the only medicine that doesn’t expire.

For a grinder, i was looking at df64 or maybe some fellow ode gen2. I mostly prepare espresso/latte coffee. But in the summer, I like to have a jug of cold brew in my fridge, so I would need a grinder that is capable of both. Not just espresso-focused grinder. I prepare about 4 coffees a day

For the machine, i am in a big dilemma. I was looking specifically at 3 machines that have a pretty big gap in price.  
First to explain my needs/wishes. I like the idea to have automatic shot. so when i am using the same coffee for a longer time periods (and for my wife which does not like scales and stuff) so its a little simpler workflow. Its not the nr1 priority but its nice to have. I want to have 58mm portafilter. I like to have quick heat up time so i dont have to turn on my machine 30min before i use it.

1. Gaggia classic pro which would then i upgrade with some gaggiuino after waranty expires or maybe even before since they are good build quality \[430€\]

2. Lelit maraX i really like the design of it but as i made some reserch it have a terrible heat up time and a bit poor PID settings. \[960€\]

3. Ascaso steel duo PID it have all the features that i want but it has poor build quality as the people say.\[1400€\]

1o2tjfe,https://i.redd.it/z8510av4b8uf1.jpeg,Why “Natural” Skincare Isn’t Always Safe — A Dermatologist Explains,"If you’ve ever scrolled through Instagram or YouTube, you’ve probably seen influencers mixing turmeric, lemon, aloe vera, or coffee in their kitchens, claiming they’ve “ditched chemicals” for “natural skincare.” It sounds tempting, doesn’t it? Who wouldn’t want glowing, chemical-free skin with ingredients from the kitchen?

But here’s the catch — *natural* doesn’t always mean *safe*. And that’s something **Dr. Sonal Chavan**, a leading [**dermatologist near me**](https://skinspecialistnearme.co.in/) and founder of **Viva Luxe**, has been explaining to countless patients who land up in her clinic with rashes, burns, and pigmentation — all thanks to “DIY natural remedies.”

Let’s dig into why our obsession with natural products sometimes does more harm than good — and how dermatologists like Dr. Chavan are helping people unlearn skincare myths that social media created.

# The Natural Skincare Myth: Where It All Began

The idea that “chemical” equals bad and “natural” equals good is a powerful one. It feeds into our collective desire for purity, simplicity, and control. After all, who wouldn’t want to believe that something straight from nature — like aloe or turmeric — is gentler than a lab-made serum?

But the truth is, even water is a chemical. Oxygen is a chemical. Everything — from coconut oil to vitamin C — has a chemical composition.

Dr. Sonal Chavan often says, “Your skin doesn’t understand marketing labels. It only understands molecules.”

What this means is that your skin reacts to *how* an ingredient interacts with its layers, not *where* it came from. So while a lab-formulated ingredient might be derived from nature, it’s been purified, stabilized, and tested — unlike that raw lemon you just squeezed onto your face.

# When “Natural” Turns Nasty — Real-Life Examples

Let’s take a few common home remedies that most of us have tried or seen online:

# 1. Lemon Juice for Brightening

The citric acid in lemon is way too harsh for direct application. It can disrupt your skin’s pH balance, cause redness, irritation, and even chemical burns — especially if you step into the sun afterward.

# 2. Toothpaste on Pimples

This one is a classic. But toothpaste contains fluoride and menthol, which dry and inflame the skin. Many of Dr. Chavan’s teenage patients at **Viva Luxe** come in with acne marks made worse by this so-called “hack.”

# 3. Raw Aloe Vera Gel

While aloe vera has anti-inflammatory benefits, unfiltered versions often contain latex or contaminants that cause allergic reactions or rashes.

# 4. Coconut Oil as Moisturizer

It’s great for the body but terrible for the face — coconut oil is *comedogenic*, meaning it clogs pores and triggers breakouts.

In a world obsessed with “natural skincare,” people forget one crucial fact — your skin is an organ. You wouldn’t apply random untested mixtures to your heart or liver, right? Then why your face?

# Dr. Sonal Chavan’s Take: “Safe skincare isn’t about labels — it’s about science.”

At **Viva Luxe by Dr. Sonal Chavan**, the approach is refreshingly straightforward. Each treatment and product recommendation is based on dermatological science, not trends.

Dr. Chavan explains that natural ingredients are not the enemy — *improper use* is. “We use plant-based actives in clinic treatments all the time, but in controlled concentrations and stable forms,” she says. “That’s what makes them effective — not just the fact that they come from nature.”

Her clinic specializes in combining **medical dermatology** with **cosmetic care** — meaning your treatments are backed by science *and* customized for your lifestyle, weather, and skin tone.

Whether you’re dealing with pigmentation, acne, or sensitivity from DIY skincare gone wrong, her goal is to help your skin heal gently — and teach you how to protect it in the long term.

# The Science Behind “Natural” Gone Wrong

To understand why some natural ingredients cause irritation, you need to know a bit about how your skin works.

Your skin barrier — made up of lipids, ceramides, and natural oils — acts like a shield. When you apply untested natural substances with unstable pH or high acidity, they can strip this barrier.

The result?

* **Increased sensitivity**
* **Breakouts and redness**
* **Pigmentation**
* **Premature aging**

Dr. Chavan compares it to over-exfoliating. “It’s like sanding your skin every day — you’re removing its protection layer by layer.”

Instead, her clinic’s philosophy revolves around **repair, balance, and protection**.

# The Viva Luxe Way: Merging Nature with Dermatology

Here’s what makes **Viva Luxe** by Dr. Sonal Chavan stand out among other skincare centers in Pune:

# 1. Custom Skin Analysis

Every consultation starts with a digital scan that measures hydration, oil production, pigmentation, and sensitivity levels. No two treatments are the same — because no two skins are.

# 2. Dermatologist-Approved Formulations

At Viva Luxe, “natural” ingredients like vitamin C, niacinamide, and green tea extracts are used — but in **stabilized, dermatologically safe concentrations**.

# 3. Focus on Long-Term Health

Instead of offering quick results, Dr. Chavan emphasizes skin balance. Whether you come in for acne, pigmentation, or dullness, she’ll first work on restoring your barrier and rebuilding your skin’s natural resilience.

# 4. Evidence-Based Treatments

From **HydraFacials** and **laser rejuvenation** to **peels and anti-aging therapies**, every treatment is rooted in science. You’ll never be sold something unnecessary — transparency is key at Viva Luxe.

# Why So Many Pune Residents Are Switching to Dermatologist-Led Skincare

The trend of visiting a **skin specialist near me** is growing rapidly — and for good reason.

Pune’s weather, pollution, and fast-paced lifestyle often lead to increased sensitivity, breakouts, and tanning. Over-the-counter or “natural” fixes rarely work in the long term because they don’t address the *root cause.*

That’s where dermatologists like Dr. Sonal Chavan come in — bridging the gap between what your skin *feels like* and what it *actually needs.*

# Real Stories, Real Skin

One of Dr. Chavan’s patients shared her story:

“I used to apply turmeric and honey masks religiously. At first, it felt good — until I started getting tiny red bumps and burning sensations. When I visited Viva Luxe, Dr. Chavan explained how my barrier was damaged and gave me a simple routine. Within three weeks, my skin looked calmer, smoother, and healthier. I wish I’d met her before trying every home remedy on the internet!”

That’s the kind of transformation Viva Luxe is known for — grounded in expertise, not trends.

# The Rise of “Clean Beauty” and the Fear of Chemicals

A big reason people fall for “natural skincare” is marketing. Brands now use terms like *paraben-free*, *sulfate-free*, or *chemical-free* — but these don’t mean much scientifically.

As Dr. Chavan says, “Even if something is paraben-free, it still contains other preservatives. Otherwise, it would grow bacteria and spoil in a week.”

She adds that *clean beauty* should mean *safe beauty*, not just “no chemicals.” Viva Luxe ensures every product and treatment passes both dermatological and ethical standards — safe for skin and sustainable for the planet.

# What You Should Actually Look for in Skincare

Dr. Sonal Chavan recommends focusing on these three things before trying any new product — whether it’s natural or synthetic:

1. **Check the pH balance** — Products too acidic or alkaline can irritate your skin.
2. **Read clinical claims, not marketing labels** — “Dermatologically tested” and “clinically proven” matter more than “100% natural.”
3. **Patch test everything** — Even natural oils and extracts can trigger allergic reactions.

# Final Thoughts: Nature Is Beautiful — But Needs Science to Be Safe

The truth is, nature gives us wonderful ingredients — but dermatology makes them *effective*.

At **Viva Luxe — Dermatologist Near Me**, [Dr. Sonal Chavan’s](https://share.google/pVyF9oDDa8zMSb2Re) team ensures you get the best of both worlds: plant-based actives blended with modern skincare science.

So before you grab that lemon or coffee scrub again, remember — your skin deserves more than trial and error. It deserves **expert care**.

If you’re struggling with dullness, pigmentation, or sensitivity caused by “natural” products gone wrong, maybe it’s time to switch from DIY to *dermatologist-led care*.
