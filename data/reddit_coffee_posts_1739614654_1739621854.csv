He got decent grades, had friends, even played basketball. But then he started playing this new game, Marvel Rivals. At first, I thought it was just another superhero thing. Seemed harmless. But then he started playing only Spider-Man. Only. Ever.

At first, I figured it was just a phase. But then he started talking about some guy named Necros like he was a god. “Necros would never miss that web shot,” he mutters under his breath. He watches his videos for hours, breaking them down like he's studying game tape for the NBA finals. He even started calling our ceiling lights “optimal grapple points.”

His grades have started slipping. His history teacher asked him why he didn’t turn in his essay, and he said, “I was too busy managing my cooldowns.” In math, he argued that Spider-Man’s web-swinging was way more practical than using angles, and when the teacher corrected him, he just sighed and said, “You probably don’t even know how to optimize your grapple.” At this point, I’m scared to check his English assignments in case he wrote another five-paragraph thesis on “Why I’m Stuck in Silver: A Teammate Tragedy.”

His movement in real life is getting weird. He constantly sidesteps around the house like he’s dodging Widowmaker shots. He tried to “boost jump” off the couch and almost knocked over the coffee table. Last week, he called his little brother a “feed bot” and tried to engage on him mid-air like it was a ranked match. And yesterday, he got absolutely countered by the family’s fish tank. He said the Namor squids were “holding better angles” than he could.

And he refuses to play anything else. “Spidey’s all I need,” he says, sitting in Silver 2, complaining that his teammates “don’t understand synergy.” SYNERGY? BRO, YOU'RE PLAYING SOLO AND JUST SLAMMING YOUR ULT INTO THE WALL.

1iq03ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/artistsWay/comments/1iq03ec/new_to_aw_seeking_advice/,"New to AW, seeking advice","Hi there. Hope you're having a wonderful day.

Today is the 6th day of Week 1 for me, and I'm really proud of myself (low expectations for the win!). Really impressed with seeming improvement of my journaling practice at least - I don't have an option to write ""I'm so sad/angry/tired I don't want to write anything today"" and just leave it at that anymore, so the entries are a bit more meaningful, if trivial and absolutely not ""creative"" or ""artistic"".

However, I have some questions which I hope you'll help me find the answers to.

1. Main issue: the week was pretty hectic, so I didn't have time to complete any exercises. I may have a couple of hours to unwind today though. So, what's the better course of actions?
   1. try to cram some exercises into this limited time I have (drawback: I've skimmed through them, and they seem to require some introspection, rushing things along may not be proper)
   2. don't do exercises, just move on to Week 2 on Monday and try to do better in the future (drawback: it'll probably be hard to stop feeling like I'm not doing my best and get rid of FOMO; and if I'll try to do them during the next week/week after that, I'll just fail and feel bad about myself)
   3. consider this week to be Week 0 (warm-up week, if you will) in which I've been preparing myself for daily journaling practice (drawback: I've already done my artist's date, and it may sound stupid, but I feel like it'll be wasted in a way)
2. I rarely have enough time for the whole 3 pages first thing in the morning (ok, like fifth actually, I *need* my coffee and I can't write in my pajamas). Is it okay to finish the entry when I have time later in the day? Is it okay to just not have time in the day and stop at one, two, two and a half pages?
3. I write at turtle speed, it's really embarassing. I can take over an hour to fill up a page sometimes (which is probably part of the reason why I don't have time to write the whole three of them). I get distracted (even though I try really hard not to), I get lost, I fall into some weird trance-like state for 10-15 minutes sometimes. Is it normal? Does it ever get easier? Or am I just wired wrong?

I *know* none of those are an ideal way to do it, but letting the perfect be the enemy of good has bit me in my behind numerous times before. On the other hand, I don't yet know the boundary when the process becomes so imperfect it loses any shred of usefulness.

It started like any other Uber shift — just me, my car, and the open road. But little did I know, today’s real challenge wouldn’t be traffic or difficult passengers. No, it would be the stank.

The first few rides were fine, until I picked up them. From the moment they slid into the back seat, the smell hit me like a punch to the face. A potent mix of fast food grease, stale cigarettes, and something… unidentifiable but definitely unpleasant. I thought, Okay, it’s just one ride. I’ll roll down the windows afterward.

But no amount of cracked windows could combat what these riders left behind. They exited the car, but their odor lingered like a bad memory. Every new passenger that entered after them probably thought I was the one who stank. Embarrassed and determined, I pulled over for an emergency deodorization mission.

First stop: gas station. I grabbed a bottle of water, but hydration wasn’t going to fix this. Next, I found an air freshener that claimed to eliminate even the most stubborn smells. Challenge accepted. I sprayed like my life depended on it. Still, the smell chuckled at my efforts.

Then came the deep clean: wiping down the seats with a vinegar-water mix I remembered from some random cleaning hack. I let the windows down to air it out while I grabbed a coffee to fuel the mission. Back at the car, I tossed in an open box of baking soda like a sacrificial offering to the smell gods.

Hours later, victory. The car smelled fresh again, as if the stank never happened. But I knew the truth. My car and I had survived a silent battle today, and I earned my fare… plus a newfound respect for industrial-grade air fresheners.

Tomorrow? I’m keeping a mini cleaning kit in the trunk. Never again.",1,1739621589.0,uberdrivers,0,1.0,False

Most recently, we have seen the end of the bull market in orange juice with a major collapse in prices the last few weeks. No Florida freeze this winter combined with the ""demand"" side of the equation (now being impacted by high prices), was the culprit. Could cocoa and coffee prices follow suit?

I stayed in Tamil Nadu for two years during my post-graduation, and there was this amazing restaurant on the highway that served a fantastic breakfast and the best South Indian filter coffee I’ve had so far.

I currently use a 3-cup moka pot for my daily coffee, but it’s too small when I have guests over.

I am thinking of getting a South Indian coffee filter but have a few questions. I'd really appreciate your help!

Can I brew smaller quantities in a large filter, or should I get a smaller one (1-2 cups) too for when I’m just brewing for myself?
 
I have seen both brass and stainless steel options. Which one is better?

Brand recommendations: There are so many options at various price points. Does the quality vary much between them? Is it worth spending extra?

I saw an inexpensive one on the Cothas Coffee website, is it a good filter? And also for coffee grounds, is Cothas a good brand?

With their **Q1 2025 10-Q out**, I wanted to break down the key takeaways, what concerns me, and whether my investment thesis still holds.

# Financial Highlights

Richtech reported $1.257 million in revenue, up 14% year-over-year, driven by its shift toward Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS). Gross profit saw a strong 86% increase to $1.134 million, showing they’re cutting costs and improving margins. However, net loss widened to $(3.548) million, mainly due to increased spending on expansion. EPS remained at $(0.04), unchanged despite higher losses due to an increased share count.

# Key Business Developments

The transition to RaaS appears to be gaining traction, which could provide more stable, recurring revenue over time. One major highlight is the jump in product revenue, from $187K to $750K, which signals actual demand for their robotics solutions. Richtech is also expanding into food automation, launching Clouffee & Tea, an automated coffee and tea concept, in February. Additionally, they opened their first One Kitchen inside a Walmart near Chicago, featuring their AI-powered robotic chef, ADAM, with expansion planned for Atlanta and San Diego. On the cost side, they’ve reduced sales and marketing expenses through referral programs and streamlined operations, which should help control spending while scaling.

# Am I Still Buying?

I first started buying because Richtech has real-world deployments, unlike some robotics startups that are all concept and no execution. This report reinforces that, but it also highlights some risks. The shift to RaaS makes sense, but execution is key—if they can’t scale it properly, losses will continue. Profitability remains a challenge, and they need to prove they can sustain growth without excessive cash burn. Competition is growing, and bigger automation players could put pressure on them. There’s also a risk of dilution, as many small-cap tech companies raise capital by issuing more shares, which could weigh on the stock.

# My Updated Position & Plan

I now hold 25 shares at an average of $2.40 and plan to keep adding 2-5 shares per week, depending on price. As long as it stays under $3 and they continue executing on their strategy, I’ll be steadily building my position.

Context: yung gf ko ay nagtatrabaho siya sa isang maliiy na cafe ngayon, siya ay nagwork don para sa makakuha ng experience kase gusto niya makapag work sa magagandang cafe in the near future. Yung inapplyan niya ay part time as a barista, ang schedule ay 8:00am - 12:00am and ang payment ay 400 per day. Pero nung pumasok siya nung monday, biglang nagbago yung schedule niya, ginawa nilang 12:00pm to 10:00pm at ang sweldo ay 400 parin. Ginawa ng full time yung schedule niya at may overtime pa na 2hrs kase full time ay 8hrs diba. Sabe nila after 3 months pa magiging minimum yung sweldo niya which is not understandable as ginawa ng fulltime ang kaniyang schedule, meron na siyang unpaid time. Pinagusapan namin ng gf ko yun and sabe niya okay lang naman daw kase for experience lang naman kaya pinalampas nalag namen. 

Pero dito na nagsimula yung panibagong
Problema, ang owner nung cofffee shop na yon ay magjowa, yung lalake ay nasa bahay mostly kase tumitingin lang sa cctv at ang babae naman ay yung nasa shop. So eto na nga, etong babaeng may ari ay pangit ang ugali, puro cellphone lang siya at may time na nagtuturo siya pero mali mali at wala sa procedure. One time ay nagalit siya sa gf ko kase bat daw siya nag cecellphone eh don sinend ng babae yung recipes ng kape at pagkain. Isa pa ay tuwing papasok dapat sobrang linis daw ng coffee shop, mop at kuskos ng pader malala at gagawin yon tuwing walng customers eh barista ang inapplyan niya hindi cleaner. Eto pa, may schedule yung gf ko na kasama niya yung kapalitan niya na late palage pumapasok kaya yung gf ko palage yung naglilinis sa opening. Ang panget pa non at late na nga yung kapalitan kinukumpara pa sa kaniya kase siya yung naglinis halos lahat. Di ba siya natingin sa cctv na meron sila ang daming cctv kahit maliit yung shop tapos di magawang tingnan.

Utos ng utos yung babaeng yon, for example ay today, february 15 may 4 boxes na kailangang iakyat sa shop at siya yung pinadala non paakyat kahit yung lalakeng owner dapat ang magdala paakyat. Nung nadala na ng gf ko yung 2 boxes sa  shop, dinagdagan pa siya ng dalawang utos kaya naiwan muna yung unang utos sa kaniya na iakyat yung naiwang karton sa ibaba. 

Last but not the least ay yung today lang din, february 15 na pinahiya yung girlfriend ko sa harap nung mga kaibigan nung owner na babae kase yung kapalitan niya ay di nirefill yung para sa drinks nung february 14. Kaya ngayon yung sumalo ng kasalanan ay yung gf ko at pinagkumpara nanaman siya habang tinatawanan nila yung gf ko. Di nila pagmamay ari yung gf ko, underpaid na nga binabastos pa nila.

1ipzt4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ipzt4k/looking_for_tips_on_first_espresso_setup_with/,Looking for tips on first espresso setup with high reliability [~2000 eur],"Hi everyone, I'm a Nespresso drinker wanting to make the move to real home espresso. I've done some research already, but I want to check with the community to see if I've missed any obvious options, or overlooked something else.

I live alone so I'll mostly be making espresso for myself, maybe 4 cups a day. I'm not really into milk drinks, so steam capabilities aren't very important to me. 

A quick start-up time is important to me. If I decide I want coffee, I don't want to have to wait for more than a few minutes to make it, that just wouldn't work for me. A power socket timer isn't really an option for me either, since my schedule is very irregular, so fast warm-up is a must.

I have some room to place the machine, but it will be under some cabinets, making it a bit tricky to fill water tanks that need top access.

Finally, this is going to be my first espresso setup, and I am probably not going to notice all the fine taste details I see in reviews. However I can afford to spend a bit, and I would like to have equipment that I can rely on pretty well, so that when the coffee is bad the issue is almost certainly my process, and not the equipment.

For the grinder, I've looked at a lot of options, as I understand it is a vital part. To me it looks like grinders like the Niche Zero, DF64 or Timemore 064s would all be more than good enough for me. But the grinder I'm liking the most is actually the Mazzer Philos. It does feel like massive overkill for my needs and skills, but it also seems like a machine that'll still serve me well 20 years from now, and it does give me confidence that it will come perfect from the factory. I also really like the way it looks. The others all feel like they might need some tweaking to work well (tweaking I don't really have the knowledge or skills for yet), and while they're solid they feel like something that'll last a decade or so and then need replacement, while not being -that- much cheaper than the Mazzer.

For the espresso machine itself, the fast startup requirement has me looking at two extremes: The Sage (Breville) Bambino, and the Ascaso Steel Uno PID. Both are thermoblock machines that barely need any warm-up, and both seem capable of producing good espresso. The Ascaso is about 5 times the price of the Bambino.

The Ascaso is a lot prettier, and I do think it'll give me more pleasure in the espresso process, just because everything is more solid. I hear temperature stability is really good as well, so that is one less thing to worry about while learning to make good shots. It does look like a machine that'll perfectly fill my every need, but the price is very steep.

I wonder if there is any machine out there that is in the sub 1000 euro range, and still matches my wants. The Profitec Go seems like the closest match I could find. The 5 min warm up is on the high side for me but tolerable, and the water tank placement would mean I have to move the machine every time I fill it, which is annoying. It's also still pretty expensive, so I'm not convinced the compromises make it a good option here.

So TL;DR. Want a highly reliable beginner setup, with minimal start-up time, for espresso only. Are there better options for me than the Mazzer Philos + Ascaso Steel Uno PID?

1ipzsvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1ipzsvn/cramping_2_weeks_post_leep/,Cramping 2 weeks post Leep,"For some context, I have had 2 Leeps since last November, after an abnormal pap result. The first Leep (mid November) confirmed CGIN and unfortunately there were no clear margins, so end of Jan I had a second one done. 

My experiences post leep have been very different. I feel recovery from the first one was pretty standard... Mild cramping for a few days, stinky discharge and ""coffee grounds"" after the first week and then discharge just came and went for another couple of weeks. I did develop a mild-ish pain in my right abdomen after the second week and I am waiting for a scan that had to be postponed due to the second leep. 

It has now been two weeks since my second Leep and I have had cramping from day 2 that has not subsided and can get pretty bad. Also, I've had a lot more spotting this time around and no smelly discharge. I'm just wondering if anyone had had a simmilar experience to my second Leep? I found the info on what to expect has been so general and limited it's hard to know for sure if this is relatively normal or if I should be more worried.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

On the new Encore ESP, I am at setting 20 just to get 42g out in less than 35s. Given that 20 is the max of the espresso range on the Encore ESP, I'm worried that I don't have fine adjustment on the high end anymore.

#Introduction

Thank you to everyone who filled in the survey! We received precisely 100 responses in total. Considering there were a bit over 250 ranked users at the time of the survey, this represents a fairly good chunk of the userbase. Two of the responses received were very obviously joke responses, so I've taken the decision to exclude them from the main analysis. I have however included their song recommendations and final comments. As a result, all other questions are out of a sample of 98.

The survey ran from 19th–23rd January 2025, with the link being reposted on the 22nd in case anyone missed the initial post. The majority of responses (80) came from the original post, while the remaining 20 were received after the repost. There were 27 questions in total, split into three sections. All questions in the survey were optional and most also included a specific 'Prefer not to say' option. In most cases, I have combined those who skipped a question and those who selected 'Prefer not to say' into a single 'Not stated' category, but there was one question where this difference seemed relevant (Q6), and so I have kept them distinct for that question.

As mentioned, this is the second user demographics survey of this subreddit. I jointly ran [the first such survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/shv4ry/results_of_the_first_rtheflyingtree_user/) back in January 2022, which is three years ago now, making this one long overdue! Where a question in this survey had an equivalent in the 2022 survey, I've provided a comparison between the two to show how the userbase has changed in the past three years. Note that the Change column in the tables below shows the difference in percentage points, i.e. if 30% of people selected a particular answer in 2022 and 15% picked that same answer in 2025, the change will be given as −15 (and not −50%).

As promised, I've made a number of graphs and maps (49!) to accompany this post. These are linked at the appropriate places throughout the post. However, I appreciate that not everyone will want to read through this all, so if you just want to see the charts, I've made **[an Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/FrLZH0r)** including them all that you can browse through.

I hope you enjoy the results as much as I've enjoyed putting this all together!

(Warning: This post is pretty long.)

|60–64|5|5.1%|+3.4|
|65–69|1|1.0%|+1.0|
|Not stated|2|2.0%|−3.9|

Mean age: 37.9

**[Figures 1–3](https://imgur.com/a/WNJW84N)**

Comments: The userbase has become much older since 2022, with a considerable drop in people under 25, while the proportion of users over 40 has more than doubled to 42.9%. The mean age has also increased by 8.4 years.

---

##Gender

Q2: What is your gender?

|Gender|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Male|67|68.4%|+6.1|
|Female|25|25.5%|−4.9|
|Non-binary or other|2|2.0%|−2.2|
|Not stated|4|4.1%|+0.9|

**[Figures 4–5](https://imgur.com/a/dsvAW2m)**

Comments: There is still a big gender imbalance, with more than twice as many men as women, which has actually got slightly worse since 2022.

---

##Transgender Status

Q3: Do you consider yourself to be transgender?

|Answer|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Yes|6|6.1%|+0.9|
|No|90|91.8%|+0.9|
|Not stated|2|2.0%|−1.8|

**[Figure 6](https://imgur.com/a/Wxnlnv2)**

Comments: We have a small transgender minority, with little change since 2022. Out of the six transgender respondents, two were male, two female and two non-binary.

---

##Sexual Orientation

Q4: What is your sexual orientation?

|Sexual Orientation|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Heterosexual/straight|59|60.2%|−3.1|
|Bisexual|17|17.3%|+3.0|
|Homosexual/gay/lesbian|10|10.2%|+6.4|
|Asexual|5|5.1%|−1.2|
|Pansexual|1|1.0%|−1.8|
|Other|4|4.1%|−1.2|
|Not stated|2|2.0%|−2.2|

**[Figures 7–9](https://imgur.com/a/aBuW4Qw)**

Comments: The majority of users are straight, with notable bisexual and gay/lesbian minorities. Interestingly, the proportion who are gay/lesbian has increased significantly since 2022, but the other figures haven't changed too much. As in the previous survey, there's a clear gender difference, with female respondents being much less likely to be straight than male respondents (44.0% vs 67.2%).

The write-in responses included two who said they were both demisexual and another orientation, one who said they were queer and one who explained that they were mostly straight but occasionally emotionally attracted to the same gender.

##Country of Residence

Q5: In which country or territory do you currently live?

|Country|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|United States|59|60.2%|+8.1|
|United Kingdom|9|9.2%|+3.9|
|Canada|7|7.1%|−0.5|
|Australia|3|3.1%|+2.4|
|Belgium|3|3.1%|+2.7|
|Germany|3|3.1%|−0.8|
|Mexico|2|2.0%|+1.7|

**[Figures 10–12](https://imgur.com/a/qlcE4JB)**

Comments: Respondents were located across 17 different countries, down from 37 in 2022. The majority of users live in the US, with a notable increase from last time. Meanwhile, the UK has overtaken Canada for a distant second place. All other countries have fairly small numbers, although Belgium is particularly well represented for its size. Interestingly, there was no-one living in India and only one person in the Netherlands, which were both quite high up in 2022. One person claimed to live in the Vatican, which is presumably a joke answer.

---

##State of Residence (US)

Q6: If you live in the US, which state do you live in?

|State|Number|Percentage|
|:--|--:|--:|
|Washington|6|6.1%|
|California|5|5.1%|
|Wisconsin|4|4.1%|
|Maryland|3|3.1%|
|New York|3|3.1%|
|Ohio|3|3.1%|
|Georgia|2|2.0%|
|Massachusetts|2|2.0%|
|Missouri|2|2.0%|
|New Jersey|2|2.0%|
|North Carolina|2|2.0%|
|Tennessee|2|2.0%|
|Texas|2|2.0%|
|All other|16|16.3%|
|Prefer not to say|6|6.1%|
|I do not live in the US|22|22.4%|
|Skipped|16|16.3%|

Note 1: Percentages are out of all respondents, i.e. 6.1% of users live in Washington, not 6.1% of US users.

Note 2: All those who skipped this question either live outside the US or did not state their country of residence.

**[Full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT29WjwhLQ4-0eOScHdq_GoGAJbbb-ATD9j9q-Jx4MkCYIfaLOEdTOaPoy8M3U_MCrC-sy5aDjW79Mb/pubhtml?gid=519865163&single=true)**

**[Figure 13](https://imgur.com/a/IC4xw6w)**

Comments: US respondents were located across 29 different states. Washington comes out on top, which is interesting as the state only makes up 2.3% of the US population, ranking 13th. It's closely followed by California and then Wisconsin, another interesting appearance. In contrast, Texas and Florida are notably underrepresented here compared to their population.

##Time Zone

Q7: What is your time zone?

|Time Zone|Number|Percentage|
|:--|--:|--:|
|UTC−5 (EST)|29|29.6%|
|UTC−8 (PST)|13|13.3%|
|UTC−6 (CST)|10|10.2%|
|UTC+0 (GMT)|9|9.2%|
|UTC+1 (CET)|8|8.2%|
|UTC−7 (MST)|3|3.1%|
|UTC+10 (AEST)|2|2.0%|
|All other|6|6.1%|
|Not stated|18|18.4%|

**[Figure 14](https://imgur.com/a/JNFBXvN)**

Comments: Respondents were located across 12 different time zones. American time zones dominate, which is to be expected given that the majority of users live in the US. GMT and CET are also somewhat common. Interestingly, a relatively large number of people didn't state their time zone. One person selected the 'Other (not listed)' option but didn't elaborate further (they appear to live in Wisconsin, which should be CST).

Using the time zone data, I've put together a graph (**[Figure 15](https://imgur.com/a/98CPRn8)**) visualising the percentage of users for which it is night, working hours and non-working hours at a given time. I have no idea how well this reflects the actual activity of the sub throughout the day, but it's interesting to see all the same. Peak night is at 6–7am UTC, when it is night for two-thirds of users. Meanwhile, peak non-working hours is at 1–2am UTC.

##Native Language

Q8: What is your native language?

|Language|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|English|80|81.6%|+12.1|
|Dutch|4|4.1%|+1.6|
|German|3|3.1%|−0.4|
|Spanish|2|2.0%|−0.1|
|Finnish|1|1.0%|0.0|
|French|1|1.0%|+0.3|
|Polish|1|1.0%|−0.7|
|Portuguese|1|1.0%|+1.0|
|Romanian|1|1.0%|+0.7|
|Other|0|0.0%|−11.5|
|Not stated|4|4.1%|−2.9|

**[Figures 16–17](https://imgur.com/a/ixpGFHH)**

Comments: The overwhelming majority of users are native English speakers, with a significant increase from 2022. Dutch has also increased slightly, overtaking German. There were nine different native languages reported in total, which is a substantial decrease from 25 languages in 2022.

---

##Other Languages Spoken Fluently

Q9: Do you speak any other languages fluently, and if so which ones?

|Language|Number|Percentage|
|:--|--:|--:|
|No other languages|69|70.4%|
|English|14|14.3%|
|French|6|6.1%|
|Spanish|2|2.0%|
|German|1|1.0%|
|Hindi|1|1.0%|
|Korean|1|1.0%|
|Latin|1|1.0%|
|Russian|1|1.0%|
|Turkish|1|1.0%|
|Not stated|7|7.1%|

**[Figures 18–19](https://imgur.com/a/VILU2iW)**

Comments: Most users don't speak any other languages fluently. Of those who do, English is by far the most common, followed by French. In addition, there were four trilingual users and one quadrilingual user.

---

##Other Languages Users Can Get by in

Q10: Are there any other languages that you can get by in (but aren't fluent), and if so which ones?

|Language|Number|Percentage|
|:--|--:|--:|
|No other languages|39|39.8%|
|Spanish|26|26.5%|
|French|17|17.3%|
|German|8|8.2%|
|Japanese|8|8.2%|
|Italian|3|3.1%|
|Irish|2|2.0%|
|Mandarin|2|2.0%|
|All other|8|8.2%|
|Not stated|7|7.1%|

**[Full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT29WjwhLQ4-0eOScHdq_GoGAJbbb-ATD9j9q-Jx4MkCYIfaLOEdTOaPoy8M3U_MCrC-sy5aDjW79Mb/pubhtml?gid=825589523&single=true)**

**[Figure 20](https://imgur.com/a/wYV4svj)**

Comments: The majority of users have some ability in a foreign language, with only 30.6% selecting 'No other languages' for both this question and the previous. Spanish is the most common language users can get by in, followed by French.

Combining the data for Q8–10, I've made some charts showing users' ability in the top four most spoken languages (**[Figures 21–24](https://imgur.com/a/jog7xxj)**). Unsurprisingly, everyone who provided data can speak English. Interestingly, while more people have some ability in Spanish, there are a greater number of fluent French speakers.

#Section 2: Education, Work and Self

##Education Level

Q11: What is your highest current level of education?

|Education Level|Number|Percentage|
|:--|--:|--:|
|Secondary school or lower|16|16.3%|
|Vocational/technical qualification|6|6.1%|
|Other non-degree qualification|3|3.1%|
|Foundation or associate degree|8|8.2%|
|Bachelor's degree|35|35.7%|
|Master's degree|20|20.4%|
|Doctorate degree|5|5.1%|
|Other university-level degree|1|1.0%|
|Not stated|4|4.1%|

**[Figure 25](https://imgur.com/a/2isis4b)**

Comments: The majority of users have some kind of degree, with a bachelor's being the most common. All types of degree have seen a distinct increase since 2022, although it should be noted that several of the options weren't directly comparable between surveys, hence why I haven't included the change column in the table above.

---

##Employment Status

Q12: What is your employment status?

|Status|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Working full-time|55|56.1%|+14.2|
|In full-time education|13|13.3%|−21.0|
|Self-employed or freelancer|9|9.2%|+8.1*|
|Retired|6|6.1%|+4.7|
|Currently unemployed|5|5.1%|+0.9|
|Working part-time|4|4.1%|−1.9|
|Stay-at-home parent or housewife/husband|0|0.0%|−3.1|
|Unable to work|0|0.0%|−2.4|
|Other|1|1.0%|−1.1|
|Not stated|5|5.1%|+1.6|

Note: Self-employed/freelancer was not a default option in 2022 but was mentioned in several write-in responses.

**[Figures 26–27](https://imgur.com/a/wKdnQPJ)**

Comments: In line with the older demographic of the sub, the percentage of students has fallen dramatically since 2022, while the percentage working full-time has significantly increased, forming a majority. There has also been a noticeable increase in the number of users who are retired. The one write-in response indicated that they work full-time for half the year.

---

##Relationship Status

Q13: What is your relationship status?

|Status|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Married or in a civil partnership|43|43.9%|+19.8|
|Single|36|36.7%|−12.6|
|In a romantic relationship|11|11.2%|−9.1|
|Widowed|2|2.0%|+1.7|

**[Figures 28–29](https://imgur.com/a/GSqNcFc)**

Comments: There's been a big increase in the percentage of users who are married or in a civil partnership. Meanwhile, those who are single and those in a non-marital relationship have correspondingly decreased significantly. Single users still however make up more than a third, not too far behind married users.

##Number of Children

Q14: Do you have children, and if so how many?

|No. of Children|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|No children|67|68.4%|−9.6|
|1|14|14.3%|+9.7|
|2|5|5.1%|−2.6|
|3|3|3.1%|−0.8|
|4|2|2.0%|+1.7|
|5|1|1.0%|+1.0|
|More than 5|2|2.0%|+1.7|
|Not stated|4|4.1%|−0.5|

**[Figures 30–31](https://imgur.com/a/0gJXcKA)**

Comments: The majority of users don't have any children, but there's been a noticeable increase in the proportion of parents. Interestingly, whereas two children was the most common number among parents in 2022, one has firmly taken this spot in 2025.

---

##Desire to Have Children

Q15: If you do not have children, would you like to?

|Answer|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|I already have children|20|20.4%|+2.9|
|Yes, I would like to have children|16|16.3%|−9.5|
|No, I do not want children|36|36.7%|+8.8|
|Undecided|16|16.3%|−4.3|
|Not stated|10|10.2%|+6.4|

**[Figures 32–33](https://imgur.com/a/y5iyocm)**

Comments: More than twice as many don't want children as do. This represents a significant change from 2022, when both percentages were fairly close. Most of those who didn't state whether they want children or not had indicated that they do have children in the previous question but simply skipped this one rather than selecting the 'I already have children' option. As such, I've combined these two categories in Figure 33.

##Current Religion

Q16: Do you follow a religion, and if so which one?

|Religion|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|No religion|81|82.7%|+19.7|
|Christianity|7|7.1%|−7.5|
|Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster*|2|2.0%|+1.7|
|Judaism|1|1.0%|+0.3|
|Islam|0|0.0%|−2.4|
|Hinduism|0|0.0%|−1.4|
|Buddhism|0|0.0%|−2.8|
|All other|3|3.1%|−5.3|
|Not stated|4|4.1%|−2.2|

Note: The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was a write-in response.

**[Figures 34–35](https://imgur.com/a/lV4vx9X)**

Comments: The overwhelming majority do not follow a religion. While this sub was already largely non-religious in 2022, this represents a considerable increase since then. Correspondingly, the percentage of Christians has more than halved, while other religions like Buddhism and Islam have completely disappeared. The three other write-in responses were Noahide, r/TheFlyingTree and agnostic leaning atheist.

---

##Religious Background

Q17: Regardless of your current beliefs, were you raised in a religion as a child, and if so which one?

|Religion|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Christianity|65|66.3%|+5.1|
|No religion|25|25.5%|+3.1|
|Hinduism|2|2.0%|−1.1|
|Judaism|1|1.0%|−2.1|
|Islam|0|0.0%|−3.1|
|Buddhism|0|0.0%|−0.7|
|Not stated|5|5.1%|+2.0|

**[Figures 36–37](https://imgur.com/a/6sAjaxY)**

Comments: The majority of users are of a Christian background, although a large minority were not brought up in any religion. There's not been a huge amount of change here from 2022, other than a general decrease in religions other than Christianity and a corresponding slight increase in the top two responses.

Three users provided further information on the denomination of Christianity they were brought up in as a write-in response. I have included these in the Christianity category in the table above and the figures, but for completeness, they were Lutheranism, Mormonism and a mix of 'different weird flavors of Christianity'.

**[Figure 38](https://imgur.com/a/W9BDXkX)**

Comments: Most users have some kind of pet. Cats are comfortably the most common, with dogs coming second. Interestingly, nearly half of dog owners also have cats. The write-in responses covered quite the selection of different animals. There were too many to fit them all in the table above without making it excessively long, so do check out the full list.

One person ticked both 'No pets' and 'Cat(s)', which I'm guessing is alluding to the idea of cats actually 'owning' us rather than the other way round, or something like that. I've included them only under 'Cat(s)'. Another person noted that the pets they live with (a dog and a cat) don't belong to them personally.

##TFT Playlist

Q21: If you had to pick a song to recommend to the Tree, what would it be?

For this question, I've put together **[a Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3YbEjBNSviB9KgyARBRVOm)** of all the songs people recommended. Do give it a listen! There's an interesting mix of music there.

I've tried my hardest to pick the right versions, but I apologise if I got any songs wrong, especially as many people didn't mention the artist. A few people named an album rather than a song, in which case I've tried to pick a popular song from that album. There were also a couple who gave an answer along the lines of 'Anything by [artist]', in which case again I've tried to pick a popular song by that artist.

Unfortunately, there were three songs that I couldn't find on Spotify, so I'll list them here: Kippa - The Tree, Chart Number 3 and [this song](https://youtu.be/qtwA_x_eO1E?si=0gjCnqOYiOmWbFT0).

Lastly, one person linked [this existing playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Scj2IhslrA2nUkxTZqRpaADR3G0n0-6&si=CIRplaA_o5oJ-EZI).

|Coffee|53|54.1%|
|Tea|32|32.7%|
|Neither|11|11.2%|
|Not stated|2|2.0%|

**[Figure 41](https://imgur.com/a/uMAKump)**

Comments: Coffee wins, just about scraping an absolute majority. The Tree still has plenty of tea lovers though, making up a third.

##Most-Used Device

Q23: What device do you use most often to access Reddit?

|Device|Number|Percentage|
|:--|--:|--:|
|Mobile phone|65|66.3%|
|Laptop|11|11.2%|
|Tablet|9|9.2%|
|Desktop computer|8|8.2%|
|Two options equally|2|2.0%|
|Not stated|3|3.1%|

**[Figure 42](https://imgur.com/a/FcWn7H4)**

Comments: Most people browse Reddit on their phones. Of those who use another device, there's a relatively even split between laptop, tablet and desktop users. Two people used a write-in response to say that they use their phone and desktop/PC equally.

##Favourite Subreddit

Q24: What's your favourite subreddit (other than r/TheFlyingTree)?

**[Full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT29WjwhLQ4-0eOScHdq_GoGAJbbb-ATD9j9q-Jx4MkCYIfaLOEdTOaPoy8M3U_MCrC-sy5aDjW79Mb/pubhtml?gid=1843770114&single=true)**

A total of 70 different subreddits were mentioned, only two of which appear more than once (r/NonCredibleDefense was mentioned three times and r/Dodgers twice). A few people mentioned more than one subreddit, in which case I've included all of them. Several people gave some kind of answer but didn't mention any specific subreddits (e.g. 'Chose any cat sub') and so haven't been included in the list above. I think one person might also have misread this question as 'What's your favourite thing about this subreddit?'

The subreddits mentioned were somewhat different from those mentioned in a similar question from the 2022 survey, with none of the top four from last time (r/AskReddit, r/INTP, r/mbti and r/atheism) appearing at all this time.

##Length of Time Part of the Tree

Q25: In total, how long have you been part of The Flying Tree?

|Length of Time|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Less than a month|24|24.5%|+2.1|
|Up to a year|22|22.4%|−41.5|
|More than a year|48|49.0%|+41.3|
|Not stated|4|4.1%|+1.3|

**[Figures 43–44](https://imgur.com/a/l4VZhZE)**

Comments: Just under half of users have been here for more than a year, which is a massive increase from 2022, albeit an entirely expected one, considering that this subreddit was only a year and three months old at the time of that survey. Meanwhile, there's been a corresponding decrease in those who have been here for between one month and a year, while the proportion who have been here less than a month is more or less the same.

Using this data, I also decided to see whether there were any interesting variations in users' answers to some of the other questions depending on how long they've been here, which revealed a couple of notable findings (**[Figures 45–46](https://imgur.com/a/HfcdoBS)**):

* Firstly, with regard to gender, female representation was quite a bit higher among new users (less than a month) at 37.5%, compared to 25.5% overall. Conversely, medium-term users (up to a year) had much lower female representation at just 13.6%. Long-term users (over a year) on the other hand were close to the overall percentage with 25.0%.

* Another interesting difference is that medium-term users are much more likely to live in the US at 77.3%, compared to 60.2% overall. The corresponding figures for new and long-term users are 58.3% and 54.2% respectively.

##Culling Status

Q26: Have you ever been culled and later rejoined the Tree?

|Answer|Number|Percentage|Change|
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Yes|7|7.1%|+1.5|
|No|87|88.8%|−0.7|
|Not stated|4|4.1%|−0.8|

**[Figure 47](https://imgur.com/a/FCZFQU2)**

Comments: Only a small number have been culled and rejoined, with a slight increase from 2022. All of those who have rejoined indicated that they have been part of The Flying Tree for more than a year in total (see previous question).

##Plans to Stick Around

Q27: Do you think you'll still be part of the Tree in a year's time?

|Answer|Number|Percentage|
|:--|--:|--:|
|Probably|73|74.5%|
|Probably not|15|15.3%|
|Not stated|10|10.2%|

**[Figures 48–49](https://imgur.com/a/AhTjINI)**

Comments: Most users expect they will still be part of The Flying Tree in a year's time, although a notable minority do not. There was also a high number of people who didn't state whether they think they will or not, possibly due to the lack of a 'Don't know' option. Long-term users (more than a year) were the most likely to think they'll still be here, at 83.3%, while new users (less than a month) were the least likely at 66.7%. Medium-term users (up to a year) were in between with 72.7%.

So, I was diagnosed with PNES in 2022 after 4 years of epilepsy/depression-anxiety disorder misdiagnosises (DAD I have now, but that's not the point). Since then, I try to understand what triggers my seizures and how to prevent it, because, naturally, anti-seizures drugs have no effect. And sometimes I have no emotional trigger at all, seizures just happens.

And that's what I found:
- I have significantly more seizures from late autumn to mid spring.
- More seizures when I'm cold
- Hungry 
- Significantly sleep deprived 
- Drunk too much coffee

All of those things have something in common: it's narrowing my blood vessels.

My family doctor and psychiatrist agree with me is is the case and I am correct. So I continue to explore my seizures and try to understand it better.

1ipzi6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ipzi6w/how_would_you_interpret_a_coworkers_mixed_signals/,How Would You Interpret a Coworker’s Mixed Signals in a Complicated Workplace Dynamic?,"Hey everyone, I’m (26M) navigating a confusing situation with a female coworker and would appreciate your perspectives. For context, we work at a small company in a conservative community where relationships/dating are heavily frowned upon. Here’s the situation:  

**What Happened:**  
- We grew very close over the past 3 weeks (emotionally vulnerable conversations, mutual support).  
- Our boss (who I respect and value professionally) recently asked her out for coffee after work. She agreed and immediately texted me to share this.  
- She claimed she “didn’t know how to say no” to him. However, we’d previously discussed his obvious interest in her, and I’d expressed discomfort about it.  

**Why I’m Confused:**  
1. **Mixed Signals**: She emphasizes honesty as a core value and shared that she’s been hurt in the past (which is why she’s “nicer” now). But her agreeing to coffee with the boss—despite knowing my feelings—makes me question her authenticity.  
2. **Suspicion**: I’m worried she might’ve been messaging him all day before the invite (they work in the same building but different companies).  
3. **My Reaction**: I panicked, told her I didn’t want to be close anymore, and cut contact without letting her explain. Now I’m torn: Was this a betrayal, or am I over-reacting?  

**Complicating Factors:**  
- **Cultural Context**: Sex/relationships are taboo here, and she’s shared sensitive personal history (e.g., losing her virginity in this environment).  
- **Work Stakes**: My boss values my skills, and I love my job. I don’t want to jeopardize that.  
- **Mental Health**: I struggle with loneliness and saw her as someone who could help me grow. Now I’m spiraling.  

**Ask:**  
- How would you interpret her agreeing to coffee with the boss after our conversations?  
- Could her “I didn’t know how to say no” be genuine, or is this a red flag?  
- How would you want a man in this situation to handle it respectfully?  

I’m trying to decide if she’s worth rebuilding trust with or if I should walk away. Honest advice appreciated—thank you.  ",1,1739619175.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Bestselling crime novelist Marcus Lane sat alone in his dimly lit study. Books and hastily scribbled notes lay scattered around him, and his newest crime scene novel rested open on his desk. Normally, he found solace in shaping fictional tales of suspense. However, the city’s recent string of murders felt unsettlingly close to the plots he had invented on these very pages.

His suspicions intensified when Detective Amelia Hart arrived at his door. Amelia was a respected investigator with a knack for cracking the toughest cases. Her sharp gaze and no-nonsense manner told Marcus that her visit was more than just a courtesy call.

“Mr. Lane,” she began, her voice steady, “I need to talk to you about the recent murders.”

Marcus ushered her inside, his mind whirling with questions. Amelia handed him a folder brimming with crime scene photos and reports, laying them out on the coffee table. Each grim image mirrored a passage from his books, echoing scenes he had meticulously crafted. The realization hit him like a punch to the gut: someone was using his fiction as a blueprint for bloodshed.

# The Unseen Killer

News outlets quickly seized on the sensational headline: “Fiction Meets Reality—Author’s Plots Turn Deadly.” Marcus tried to escape the media frenzy by burying himself in his work, but the parallels between his written words and the grisly crimes outside could not be ignored.

Meanwhile, Amelia scoured every crime scene, meticulously matching details with Marcus’s novels. Her findings confirmed the horrifying truth: whoever was responsible had studied his work in chilling detail. The trail of terror included staged scenes that could only have come from someone deeply familiar with Marcus’s writing.

One afternoon, Amelia returned to Marcus’s study. She looked weary yet determined. “We need to work together,” she told him. “You understand these plots better than anyone. If we combine forces, maybe we can get one step ahead of the killer.”

Marcus agreed, though he felt both dread and resolve. He had no desire to see his fictional nightmares come to life again. But if his knowledge could help Amelia, he owed it to the victims—and to himself—to break the lethal bond between fact and fiction.

# Shadows of Suspicion

Soon, Marcus realized suspicion was creeping toward him from all angles. Police scrutiny intensified with every new murder, as the public wondered whether he was somehow complicit. He felt the weight of their eyes whenever he ventured outside, and even more so in the hushed glances of officers on the case.

Despite the tension, he and Amelia dove deeper into his body of work. They spent late hours combing through each book, scene by scene, searching for any unique detail that might lead to a breakthrough. As they read, Marcus experienced his stories from a darker vantage. He saw how easily a twisted mind could seize upon the violence he had imagined.

One night, while comparing a gruesome passage in his third book with a fresh crime scene, Amelia looked up. “This last victim’s injuries,” she said quietly, “they’re identical to the way you described them on page 213. It’s almost word for word.”

Marcus’s pulse quickened. He remembered writing that scene years ago, never suspecting someone could replicate it so precisely in real life. “We need to think about who has had access to my manuscripts,” he murmured. “And not just the finished books—drafts, notes, everything.”

Amelia nodded. “Exactly. Someone close to you might know these stories inside and out.”

# Cryptic Clues

The killer began to leave small, cryptic hints at each new crime scene. These tokens were subtle, barely noticeable, yet they pointed directly to Marcus’s novels. One of the latest scenes took place in a quiet park on the outskirts of the city. The victim was found near a bench, a single rose placed beside her in an unsettling echo of a scene from Marcus’s second book.

When Amelia and Marcus arrived, they combed the area for any hidden message. Marcus spotted a folded scrap of paper tucked beneath the bench. He unfolded it, his breath catching as he recognized a page torn from one of his manuscripts—complete with underlined words: “The truth hides in the darkest corner.”

Amelia studied the underlined passage. “Dark corners,” she said, her voice low. “Is there a place in your story where something vital was concealed in darkness or shadows?”

Marcus recalled a moment in one of his books involving a secret hidden in thick shrubbery. Glancing around, he noticed a dense cluster of trees nearby. Together, they cautiously moved toward the grove. Within its shadows, they discovered a small wooden box containing a USB drive.

Gazing at the box, Marcus felt a knot of dread tighten in his chest. The killer wanted their attention—and was clearly toying with them, step by harrowing step.

# The Hidden Message

Back at Marcus’s house, he plugged the USB drive into his computer. Amelia stood behind him, poised for any revelation. The drive contained a single video file, marked simply “Play Me.”

The screen showed a figure cloaked in darkness, their face hidden by a hood. A distorted voice crackled through the speakers. “You’re close,” it mocked, “but not close enough. The next chapter is already being written. Are you prepared to stop it?”

Then the image vanished. Marcus and Amelia exchanged a grim look. The killer was not just imitating plotlines; they were creating a sinister new narrative—one that included Amelia and Marcus as unwilling participants.

“This is a challenge,” Marcus said, rage building in his voice. “They’re daring us to catch up.”

Amelia nodded. “We have to see if there are any hidden details in the video itself—audio background noise, unique items in the frame, anything.”

They replayed the footage, slowing it down to examine each pixel. Although the video was grainy, they caught small glimpses of a room. A dim lamp flickered against peeling wallpaper. A single window was barely visible, boarded up from the inside.

Marcus leaned closer. “Somewhere old, abandoned, or both,” he murmured. “We’ll find it, but we need more clues.”

# Racing Against Time

In the days that followed, the investigation moved at a furious pace. The media latched onto the story with a feverish appetite, painting Marcus as the accidental puppeteer in these real-world horrors. He tried to ignore the cameras hounding him, focusing solely on the killer’s next move.

Yet each new piece of evidence felt like a half-complete puzzle. Amelia kept pushing the forensic team to analyze every detail, while Marcus combed through his old files, personal journals, and even discarded drafts. He was desperate to spot anything that might match these meticulously staged crimes.

Late one evening, Amelia paced through Marcus’s study. “There’s something we’re still missing,” she said, frustration lacing her words. “We’re following each clue, but the killer seems always a step ahead.”

Marcus rubbed his forehead. “They’re constructing a narrative out of my stories, but they’re also adding pieces I never wrote. We need to see the big picture.”

Together, they laid out all the evidence on a large wooden table. Photographs, scraps of paper, lines from his novels—each item had some link to the murders. As they tried different ways of organizing the clues, a new pattern emerged: the killer was weaving a personal tale that spoke directly to Marcus. This realization both frightened and energized him. He suddenly understood the murderer might be someone who knew him intimately.

# A Personal Connection

That thought nagged at Marcus, feeding a deep sense of dread. Who could know the hidden corners of his mind well enough to craft this living nightmare? Friends, colleagues, and former mentors flitted through his memory.

Amelia noticed his anxious look. “What is it?”

Marcus inhaled slowly. “This killer knows my darkest ideas. They’ve dissected my narratives, found the emotional core, and used it against me. Only someone who has seen my works from the inside out could do that.”

He thought of his old editor, Victoria, who had encouraged him to explore edgy themes. She had read every early draft and offered feedback on his most twisted storylines. Suddenly, her name rose to the top of Marcus’s mental suspect list.

“I think it might be Victoria,” he murmured, almost hating himself for saying it. “She had access to my drafts and pushed me to make my stories darker. She knew exactly how my imagination worked.”

Amelia frowned, considering the possibility. “We should talk to her. If she’s innocent, she can help. If she’s not, we’ll know soon enough.”

# Confronting the Past

The drive to Victoria’s small cottage felt unreal to Marcus. Memories of late-night edits and animated conversations about plot twists swirled in his mind. How could someone he once trusted be linked to such horror?

They parked on the quiet street, tension mounting as they approached the front door. Marcus knocked, heart hammering. A moment later, Victoria answered, eyes wide with apparent surprise.

“Marcus,” she said, a hint of worry in her voice. “Why are you here? Is something wrong?”

Marcus exchanged a glance with Amelia before stepping inside. “We need to talk,” he said. “It’s about the murders.”

Victoria’s face paled. “Murders? Marcus, I… I don’t understand.”

Amelia fixed her with a calm but intense look. “We have reason to believe you might be connected. We’d like you to answer a few questions.”

Victoria’s gaze darted between them. “Of course,” she said shakily. “I’ll help however I can. But I’m not involved, I swear.”

Marcus studied her closely. She appeared genuinely shocked, but the killer had proven adept at deception. Still, he forced himself to keep an open mind. If Victoria wasn’t guilty, then the real murderer remained out there, one step ahead.

# Unraveling the Truth

Victoria’s living room was cozy, lined with shelves of old books and manuscripts. Marcus remembered spending countless hours here discussing the early drafts of his novels. Now, this familiar place felt charged with suspicion.

Sitting across from Victoria, Amelia laid out the reasons for their visit. She showed her pages from the crime scenes, each lifted from Marcus’s work, each meticulously underlined. Victoria stared at them, horror etched on her features.

“I never imagined anyone could do this,” Victoria whispered. “Marcus, you know I love your writing, but this is monstrous. I had nothing to do with it.”

Marcus watched her reaction carefully. Either Victoria was an accomplished liar, or she was innocent. Amelia, too, seemed uncertain. “If you’re truthful, any insight you can offer might help us,” Amelia said.

Victoria nodded. “I’ll do my best. I just… I’m so shocked.”

After hours of questioning, they found no clear evidence against her. Victoria offered to let investigators search her home and computers. She even produced emails from her time as Marcus’s editor, hoping to rule herself out. Despite his growing desperation, Marcus realized Victoria might truly be innocent.

# A Twist in the Tale

That same night, as Marcus mulled over Victoria’s words, his phone rang. The number was blocked. He answered, anxiety gripping him.

“You’re looking in the wrong place,” hissed the distorted voice. “Search your own past, Marcus. The truth is much closer than you think.”

A shiver ran down his spine. This was the same voice from the USB video: the killer, taunting him yet again. Once the call ended, Marcus told Amelia everything. She flipped through her notes, eyes narrowed.

“We’ve been so focused on the manuscripts and the people directly linked to them,” she said. “Maybe we overlooked someone else in your circle.”

They worked late into the night, reevaluating each clue. As they revisited old relationships and acquaintances, one name leaped into Marcus’s thoughts—someone who lurked in the background of his career yet witnessed many private details. A creeping sense of clarity brought both dread and relief.

“I know who it is,” Marcus said softly, meeting Amelia’s gaze. “And I was so wrong to suspect Victoria.”

# The Final Chapter

They wasted no time setting a trap, intent on exposing the true killer. Marcus drafted a new “chapter,” one that spelled out a horrifying scenario likely to lure the murderer into the open. He posted it online, knowing the killer tracked his every move.

Amelia orchestrated a hidden police presence. She staked out the area described in the fake scene, deploying her team with careful precision. Marcus waited too, nerves on edge. If their plan succeeded, they would corner the killer before another life was taken.

Hours crawled by without any sign of movement. Just when Marcus felt the sting of hopelessness, a cloaked figure emerged from the darkness, stepping into the carefully arranged location. Amelia’s team closed in, but the killer was quick, slipping into the shadows.

Marcus pursued, adrenaline pounding in his ears. He refused to let the monster vanish again. Determination flared as he recalled every clue, every twisted detail that had haunted him. His own fictional nightmares had manifested, but tonight, he intended to banish them once and for all.

# Face to Face

At last, Marcus cornered the killer in a deserted alley where weak streetlights cast long, eerie shadows. Amelia arrived moments later, breathless but poised. They faced a figure whose features were now fully visible.

“Hello, Marcus,” the killer said, voice dripping with scorn. “Been waiting for me?”

Marcus’s chest tightened. He recognized this person—someone he’d once trusted. That realization cut deeper than any blade. “Why?” he demanded, his voice taut. “Why turn my stories into a slaughterhouse?”

A mirthless smile tugged at the killer’s lips. “Your work was never just fiction to me. I’ve spent years watching you craft these dark masterpieces. And I decided it was time the world felt the terror you only wrote about.”

Amelia took a step forward, her hand hovering near her holster. “Drop any weapons and keep your hands where we can see them,” she ordered.

The killer looked between them. For a moment, something like regret flickered in their eyes. Then the grin returned, colder than ever. “You have no idea how far I would go to finish this story.”

# The Truth Unveiled

Marcus and Amelia stood firm, confronting the killer who had orchestrated every grisly tableau. The killer, once hidden by false leads, now faced the truth of their own exposure. Wind gusted through the alley, rustling loose paper and intensifying the tension.

“Your novels showed me how darkness can thrive,” the killer said. “I saw the potential in your words—the potential to terrify, to enthrall, to blur the line between imagination and reality.”

Marcus clenched his fists. “You lost your humanity for the sake of a twisted ‘art.’ People are dead because you wanted to bring fiction to life.”

A brief flash of anger crossed the killer’s face. “Art demands sacrifice, Marcus,” came the retort. “If not for Amelia meddling, you might have appreciated this masterpiece in its entirety.”

Amelia stepped closer, her voice low yet resolute. “No more talking. The nightmare ends here. You’re coming with us.”

Rage contorted the killer’s expression, but with Amelia’s team converging, escape seemed impossible. Marcus felt every fiber of tension in the air. One final standoff remained before the city could breathe again.

In a final, desperate move, the killer reached for a hidden weapon. Yet Amelia, anticipating such treachery, reacted at once. Within seconds, the killer was disarmed and pinned down, the culminating chapter of their violent tale cut short. Sirens blared in the distance, heralding the end of the deadly spree.

# Rewriting the Ending

Under the glow of harsh floodlights, the killer was taken into custody. The entire city, so long paralyzed by fear, could at last begin to heal. Reporters clamored for interviews, and the public demanded every detail of the sensational case.

Marcus felt relief wash over him, yet grief lingered for the lives lost. He stood beside Amelia, gazing at the flickering police lights. “I never wanted my writing to cause this much pain,” he murmured. “I just wanted to craft compelling stories.”

Amelia placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “You aren’t responsible for someone else’s twisted actions. They chose to use your fiction as a weapon. You helped stop them.”

Marcus exhaled, sensing a weight lift from his soul. “Now that it’s over,” he said softly, “I think it’s time to start a new chapter—one that doesn’t revolve around murder and mayhem.”

Amelia nodded. “You’ll write again. Just remember that your words have power, and you can choose how to wield it.”

# The Darkness Brought to Light

As dawn broke, the city stirred to life with cautious optimism. Headlines declared the killer’s capture, and tentative hope replaced the fear that had overshadowed every street corner. Inside his study, Marcus sifted through the remnants of the case: photos, scribbled notes, and the final scene he had planted to draw the murderer out.

In a box nearby lay the personal items he no longer wanted to cling to—objects that once fueled sinister inspiration. Though the images of the murders would always haunt him, he vowed to channel his creativity differently. He knew he was capable of writing gripping fiction without unleashing such real-world terror.

Amelia visited him later that morning, bringing warm coffee and an encouraging smile. “You stood your ground when it mattered,” she said. “Not just anyone would face the person who stole their words and twisted them into nightmares.”

Marcus accepted the coffee, nodding gratefully. “I had to do it. Otherwise, these stories might never have ended.” He glanced around his study, which felt both familiar and strangely new. “Now, I need to find fresh inspiration—something honest, something hopeful.”

# A New Chapter

Life gradually began to return to normal, though neither Marcus nor Amelia would soon forget the harrowing events they had endured. Marcus spent his days reorganizing his workspace, cleaning out the dark corners of his imagination. He typed steadily at his computer, drawing from a well of experiences that had shaped him profoundly.

Amelia, meanwhile, continued her detective work. Yet she found moments to drop by Marcus’s home, sharing updates on cases less nightmarish than the one they had just closed. Together, they formed an unspoken bond forged in the crucible of fear and determination.

One evening, Marcus pushed aside his latest manuscript, feeling a wave of calm. He picked up his phone and texted Amelia: *I’m finally writing a new kind of story—one that ends in hope.*

She replied moments later: *That’s the best kind. Can’t wait to read it.*

A small smile broke across Marcus’s face. The darkness that once threatened to consume him had lost its grip. Now, in the quiet hum of his study, he crafted a different narrative—one where possibility replaced dread, and healing overcame the shadows.

I came up with the idea of trying a new sushi restaurant and she agreed and seemed keen on going.

The problem is she got sick shortly after our conversation **(via text)** about the sushi restaurant and she just recently got better. She had to get an X-ray of her lungs and after a few days of no contact i messaged her today:



*Me:* Hey, how did the x-ray go?

*Her:* Heyy, it was fine and i'm feeling alot better i can properly breathe now so i'm doing alot better!!😊

*Me:* That's great to hear! I was a bit worried to be honest😂

*Her (after leaving me on delivered for an hour):* Me too i'd go crazy if i had to spend one more day inside



And now i have no idea how to go on from here. She left me on delivered and I honestly want **her** to mention the sushi first, because i feel like i'd seem needy if i did. Should I just end this convo and maybe mention it in a few days?  Any ideas? Thanks.",1,1739619032.0,teenagers,2,0.67,False

- sloppy butcher and Franklins for slowdown and trapping items  
- infectious fright to cover myself when I wanna pick up and locate anyone nearby when I down
- agitation to drag survivors into my trapped areas 

I place traps in areas that are ‘too late to see’ during a chase and drop them in front of pallets during a chase to deny it and catch up with the haste. They obviously see this and it pushes them away or later on it catches someone else. I also place them on tight loops

Any advice to help ease me into the role? I’m using the fast trap setting and smaller trigger radius to quickly drop traps in chase and there’s less room for them to move if I teleport to one. Also had some fun trapping dropped items

For context, we work at a small company in a conservative community where relationships/dating are heavily frowned upon. Here’s the situation:  

**What Happened:**  
- We grew very close over the past 3 weeks (emotionally vulnerable conversations, mutual support).  
- Our boss (who I respect and value professionally) recently asked her out for coffee after work. She agreed and immediately texted me to share this.  
- She claimed she “didn’t know how to say no” to him. However, we’d previously discussed his obvious interest in her, and I’d expressed discomfort about it.  

**Why I’m Confused:**  
1. **Mixed Signals**: She emphasizes honesty as a core value and shared that she’s been hurt in the past (which is why she’s “nicer” now). But her agreeing to coffee with the boss—despite knowing my feelings—makes me question her authenticity.  
2. **Suspicion**: I’m worried she might’ve been messaging him all day before the invite (they work in the same building but different companies).  
3. **My Reaction**: I panicked, told her I didn’t want to be close anymore, and cut contact without letting her explain. Now I’m torn: Was this a betrayal, or am I overreacting?  

**Complicating Factors:**  
- **Cultural Context**: Sex/relationships are taboo here, and she’s shared sensitive personal history (e.g., losing her virginity in this environment).  
- **Work Stakes**: My boss values my skills, and I love my job. I don’t want to jeopardize that.  
- **Mental Health**: I struggle with loneliness and saw her as someone who could help me grow. Now I’m spiraling.  

**Ask:**  
- How would you interpret her agreeing to coffee with the boss after our conversations?  
- Could her “I didn’t know how to say no” be genuine, or is this a red flag?  
- How would you want a man in this situation to handle it respectfully?  

I’m trying to decide if she’s worth rebuilding trust with or if I should walk away. Honest advice appreciated—thank you.  ",1,1739618806.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I 28(?) is an only child who used to live in the city after graduating from college and started working in several corporate companies. 

Tatay ko (sana hindi nalang), 54 ay nakaasa lang sakin simula nung nagtrabaho ako. Simula pagkabata ko masasabi ko naman na may mga good memories ako with him but that doesn't change the fact na he's an AH. Growing up, chaotic ang  childhood ko. I have half siblings sa side ng mom ko and around 7-8 years old ako nung nahanap nila si mama and lived with us. We were okay, not until years passed by and laging nag-aaway sina mama at papa. My sibs were teens during those times pala in their 15s-20s. 

Nasaksihan ko pano murahin ng tatay ko ang mga kuya ko na para bang sya ang nagpapalamon samin, when in fact asa lang din sya sa kita ng mama ko. Palamunin din sya kagaya namin. Sinasabihan nyang tamad ang mga kapatid ko pero sya ang numero unong tamad. Mga ate at kuya ko ang laging naghuhugas ng mga pinaglutuan at pinagkainan. Naglilinis ng paligid naglilinis ng bahay. Tatay ko? Hilata all day. Bisyo at sugarol pa. Tapos pag hindi nabigyan ng mama, mumurahin si mama mula ulo hanggang paa. Ambag nya? Tagaluto. Dapat lang. 

Ilang beses nyang pinalayas ang mga kapatid ko sa walang kwentang dahilan. Mga palamunin daw. Ang totoo nyang gusto nyang solohin lang ang kakarampot na kinikita ng nanay ko non. Pero my mom was an amazing woman. Nakaya nya kaming buhayin living a comfortable like kahit 3 kaming nag-aaral non ng ate at kuya ko, elem, hs at college. Then 9 katao kami dito sa bahay. 

Growing up din, elementary and high school ilang beses kaming pinalayas ng magaling kong tatay dito sa bahay namin. Dahilan? Hindi daw nakikinig ang mama ko sa kanya na palayasin ang mga kapatid ko. My mom was perfect and a supermom. Wala akong masamang masasabi sa kanya. Gago lang ang tatay ko kasi selfish at narcissist sya. 

Ff. College freshman ako when my mom died because of cancer. Gumuho mundo ko non haha. Depressed. 9 years ago na pero the pain is still here. I graduated college sa tulong ng mga lolo at lola ko pati ng tito ko. Parents at Kapatid ng tatay ko. Yes, iniasa nya ko sa kanila dahil wala syang kakayahan. Wala syang trabaho. 


Thankfully, nakahanap agad ako ng trabaho sa city. I stayed there. That's the only time I felt free. And simula ng kalbaryo ko. Sakin nalipat ang lahat ng responsibilidad. Malakas pa sa kalabaw ang tatay ko. Ayaw nya lang magtrabaho dahil nakaasa sya buong buhay nya sa mga tao sa paligid nya. 

My salary is not that high, sakto lang. Nagbabayad akong rent sa city and pagkain ko pa. Other bills and such. 
Minsan delay ang sahod. Kapag ganon, abot abot ang mura na nakukuha ko sa tatay ko dahil wala pa kong maipadala. Hindi masyadong malaki napapadala ko, pero alam kong tama lang yon to buy his needs and necessities. 

Cycle went on, palala ng palala. I'm now the breadwinner I never wished to be. 

Last October he had a back surgery. My partner and I had to stay with him dahil hindi daw pwede ang live in partner.btw, inintay muna nilang lumala yung sugat sa likod bago nadala sa ospital. Hinahayaan lang sya dito sa bahay, he refused my tito's offer to bring him to the doctor and such. Until my kuya checked on him and told me he has boil sa likod. It got infected. I never wanted to see him. But out of awa, I asked my partner to see him to check if it's true ganon. Then tumawag sya sakin to show how terrible my dad's back looks like. Boil was infected. Madaming nana, namamaga and he's like kuba na. My partner did not hesitate to bring him to the nearest hospital. He was confined and underwent a back surgery. Open wound. Sabi ng doctor if di pa nadala aabot na sa buto ng spinal nya yung nana. Mas mahirap. 

After few days nakalabas na sya, ako nagbabantay sa kanya non. I needed to file leaves sa work kase walang magbabantay sa kanya. Sa bahay, akin lahat. After a week of travelling from province to city everyday, I feel like pabagsak na ang katawan ko. I only sleep for 1-3hrs everyday. Hindi bedridden ang tatay ko. Tamad lang. I gave him that time to recover kaya I endured lahat ng pagod. 

That same week, I asked my partner if pwede nya ako masamahan pansamantala dito sa bahay just to make sure someone would look after sa tatay ko while I'm at work. He even offered it too though before I even asked. Alam nya pagod ko and all. Oks naman nung una. May mga moodswings tatay ko na hindi lang mabili ang gustong ulam di na kami kakausapin, laging galit. Bababuyin ang bahay  itatambak ang hugasin. Lahat ng bawal na pagkain yun ang gusto. Ofc aalma ko, naggagamot sya e. 

We work nigh shift, full time ako and part time si partner. 3-4hrs per night sya.  Sobrang draining neto. After a month naospital at naconfine ulit sya. Acute gastritis. Hindi maawat sa kape at yosi e. Partner ko ulit nagsugod sa kanya sa ospital nasa byahe nako non patrabaho. I needed to stop midway to go back. All 3 days he was in the hospital magkaaway kami. Second night na nandon sya, his live in partner came. So I left and told them hindi nako magbabantay. Bibilhin ko lang mga gamot na kailangan at kukunin mga panglinis ng sugat nya, ihahatid don at uuwi nako. Galit na galit sya sakin at sa nurses for not letting him eat. NPO kase kailangan kunan ng dugo at i-ultrasound. So bawal food. Inaway nya nurses pati ako. Nagsagutan kami. Since that day, naipon na naman ng naipon lahat ng galit ko. He even told my tito na hindi sya dinadalhan ng pagkain don. Sinungaling talaga haha. 

Nagdadabog ako all throughout whenever I enter or leave his room. Gusto kong maramdaman nya na galit na galit ako. Nung ilalabas na sya, tinggalan ng swero. Lumabas ng kwarto kasi mainit daw. Ghorl, may AC don. Ayaw nyang ipasara ang pinto kaya umiinit sa loob. Niradyo sya ng guards. Live in partner nya takot sa kanya. 😏 

I stopped talking to him. Nung ibinababa na sya ng wheelchair for discharge, iniwan ko sila. I waited sa lobby kasama partner ko. Nung dumating yung service iniwan ko din sila. Nagcommute kami ng boyfriend ko. Pero dala namin yung mga gamit. 

Things got worse, recently we had a heated argument and pinapalayas nya na kami ng partner ko. For context, we covered all expenses here. Some things got compromised. Our rents were behind and all. Naubos pati savings namin. I got severely depressed and I needed to quit my job. Almost 1 month na din na wala akong trabaho but I still provide may natira pa naman. 

Now he hates us for sleeping in the morning. Perwisyo daw kami at malas all because he wakes up early only to drink his coffee then hihilata na buong araw. While us? Work at night. 

Nilock nya yung gas tank, tinago mga lutuan. Nagkasagutan kami. I told him na napakasama ng ugali nya. This all rooted from all the anger I burried inside me. Unspoken shts. And he answered back saying ako ang masama ang ugali na PI ko and animal ako. I just told him  aalis kami once we have the money and I even said pasensya na dahil di pa kami makaalis. Pero di kami magiging pabigat. Never naman talaga kami naging pabigat sa totoo lang sya ang perwisyo e . All he knows is maghintay ng biyaya haha. 

I left one day for an interview. My boyfriend said nawalan ng kuryente. When he said that, alam ko na kagad na pinatay yon ng magaling kong ama sa main switch. Hindi ako makafocus non. I was too worried because my partner has athma and buti hindi masyado mainit that day. After interview umuwi kagad ako. Kuryente is back. Dumating kasi live in partner nya. 

Wala na kaming kibuan dito sa bahay. Suklam na suklam ako. Kung may pera lang kaming pangrent nakaalis na kami agad. But for now kailangan namin magtiis. 

I can't go to work because I'm worried about sa pwede nyang gawin sa partner ko pag wala ako. He may not hurt my partner physically pero his mouth is too evil like him at baka hindi na sya mapagtimpian neto. I'm praying na sana makaalis na kami asap.

This plot outline for ""Mr."" explores the multifaceted pressures faced by Arjun Mehta, a modern Indian man, offering a compelling counterpoint to the narrative of ""Mrs.""  It delves into the emotional, social, and cultural nuances of his experiences, providing a rich foundation for a novel, screenplay, or long-form story.

*Part 1: The Weight of Expectations*

1. The Unseen Burden (5:00 AM)
 * Setting: A modest 3BHK apartment on the city's outskirts.  Sunlight struggles to pierce the curtains.
 * Action: Arjun's alarm blares. He silences it quickly, a practiced movement. Priya stirs beside him. He rises, a ghost in the pre-dawn darkness.
 * Details: The 3BHK is a compromise. Closer to Sharvi's school, room for visiting parents, but the crippling EMI is a constant weight.  The previous, smaller flat was affordable, but Sharvi's long commute was a guilt trip.  Arjun's day begins in the shadows, a metaphor for the unseen burdens he carries.
 * Internal Monologue: Another day. Another mountain to climb.  Must leave by 6:00 AM...Sharvi's lunch...the presentation...God, I hope traffic isn't a nightmare.

2. The Silent Ritual (5:30 AM - 6:00 AM)
 * Setting: The kitchen, dimly lit.  The smell of brewing coffee hangs in the air.
 * Action: Arjun moves with practiced efficiency, a silent ballet of breakfast preparation. He packs Sharvi's lunch, checks her uniform, scans the to-do list plastered on the fridge – a monument to his responsibilities.
 * Details:  Each item on the list is a pressure point:  ""Pay electricity bill,"" ""Schedule parent's doctor's appointment,"" ""Finalize project proposal."" He glances at his phone – a barrage of Slack messages already demanding his attention.
 * Emotional Note:  The weight of the day presses down on him even before sunrise.  He's a machine, programmed to perform, not feel.

3. The Commute: A Shared Silence (6:00 AM - 7:30 AM)
 * Setting: The car, stuck in the burgeoning traffic.  Sharvi is slumped in the back seat, half-asleep.
 * Action: Arjun tries to engage Sharvi, but her responses are monosyllabic.  He steals glances at her in the rearview mirror, a flicker of tenderness amidst the rising anxiety.
 * Details: This commute is their only shared time during the week.  Arjun yearns for connection, but Sharvi is a child, burdened by her own early mornings.  He worries about her, about school, about the future.  Fuel prices flash on a billboard – another financial sting.
 * Internal Monologue: Is this all there is?  A life spent in traffic, a blur of deadlines and responsibilities?  Sharvi deserves better.

4. The Grind: The 9-to-9 Reality (9:00 AM - 8:00/9:00 PM)
 * Setting: The sterile office environment.  The hum of computers and the click-clack of keyboards fill the air.
 * Action: Arjun clocks in, knowing he'll be one of the last to leave.  His boss's casual mention of weekend work hangs in the air like a threat.
 * Dialogue: Boss: ""Arjun, we're really relying on you for this project.  Layoffs are a real concern, you know.""
 * Emotional Note:  The constant pressure to perform, the fear of job insecurity, the gnawing awareness of his financial obligations – it's a relentless cycle.  Lunch breaks are spent scrolling through insurance plans, a constant reminder of his mortality and his family's vulnerability.

5. The Homeward Journey: Errands and Exhaustion (8:00/9:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
 * Setting: The car, crawling through the evening traffic.  Arjun's shoulders ache, his eyes burn.
 * Action: Priya calls, her voice a mix of concern and exasperation.  Groceries, Sharvi's notebooks, a reminder of the domestic front he must also manage.
 * Emotional Note:  Even after a grueling day, there's no respite.  The to-do list never ends.  He's a provider, a father, a husband – each role demanding its pound of flesh.

6. The Domestic Divide (10:00 PM onwards)
 * Setting: The apartment, warm and lived-in, but also a battleground of unspoken expectations.
 * Action: Arjun arrives home, the scent of dinner filling the air.  Priya is watching TV, a subtle undercurrent of resentment in her demeanor.
 * Dialogue: Priya: ""You're late again. We need to talk about the family function. And I need you to take me shopping this weekend.""
 * Details: Priya, too, works, but her sabbatical has given her a different perspective.  Arjun understands, but his own exhaustion is a wall between them.  He longs for connection, but the words get lost in the weariness.
 * Emotional Note: He's trapped in a double bind.  If he helps with chores, he loses precious downtime.  If he doesn't, he's the uncaring husband.


*Part 2: The Crushing Weight*

(Scenes 7-14 expand on the escalating pressures from family, societal expectations, and Arjun's declining health.  These sections should delve deeper into the specific dynamics with his parents, in-laws, colleagues, and the subtle ways in which he is both supported and undermined by those around him.  The focus should be on building a sense of increasing claustrophobia and Arjun's growing sense of isolation.)

7. The Family Tug-of-War:  Balancing the demands of his parents and in-laws, feeling like he's constantly failing someone.

8. The Financial Tightrope:  The constant anxiety of EMIs, school fees, medical bills, and the pressure to maintain a certain lifestyle.

9. The Startup Dream Deferred:  His entrepreneurial aspirations stifled by the need for stability, a sense of lost potential.

10. The Isolation of the Provider:  His hobbies neglected, his intellectual life withering, a growing disconnect with Priya.

11. The Social Performance:  The endless round of weddings, family gatherings, and social obligations, a constant drain on his energy and resources.

12. The Cracks in the Facade:  Physical symptoms – headaches, back pain, hair loss – begin to manifest, ignored and rationalized away.

13. The Breaking Point:  A panic attack at work, a stark reminder of his deteriorating health, the culmination of years of suppressed stress.

14. The Confrontation:  Priya and his family finally see the toll that his relentless pursuit of ""success"" has taken.  The unspoken tensions and resentments surface.

Part 3: Rebuilding and Redefining
(Scenes 15-20 focus on Arjun's journey towards self-awareness and change.  This section should explore the difficult conversations, the setting of boundaries, and the gradual process of healing.  It's not about a magical transformation, but about small, incremental steps towards a more balanced life.)

15. The Reckoning:  Arjun is forced to confront his own denial and the expectations that have shaped his life.

16. The First Steps:  Taking time off, seeking medical help, starting to communicate his needs to Priya.

17. Setting Boundaries:  Negotiating new terms at work, pushing back against the ""hustle culture,"" learning to say ""no.""

18. Reconnecting with Himself:  
Rediscovering old hobbies, carving out time for himself, nurturing his intellectual and emotional needs.

19. Redefining Masculinity:  Challenging traditional notions of male stoicism and self-sacrifice, embracing vulnerability and seeking support.

20. The New Normal:  Life is still challenging, but Arjun is no longer a victim of circumstance.  He has learned to prioritize his well-being, to communicate his needs, and to find a more sustainable way of living.  The ending should be realistic and hopeful, acknowledging that the struggle is ongoing, but that change is possible.  The final image could be Arjun and Sharvi sharing a quiet moment, a symbol of the connection he has fought to preserve.

""Mr."" is a story about the silent struggles of modern men, the pressures they face, and the courage it takes to redefine what it means to be a man in today's world. It's a story about finding balance, about self-care, and about the importance of empathy and understanding.

I take extended release metformin (500MG) daily along with berberine, Sucontrol D, pumpkin Seed Oil, Blood sugar 365 and my husband makes me a ginger tea mixed with apple cider vinegar from the mother. 

I have lost a total of 30 lbs since being diagnosed a year ago, it isnt a lot but I feel like I'm trying my best. I also work overnights (6pm - 6am) which makes me wonder if that has anything to do with it. I try to get a decent amount of hours for sleep (7:30am - 1:30pm) and start my day with either egg whites or a coffee mixed with glucerna. 

Last time I checked my blood sugar I was at 147. I'm so tired of this. I'm tired of pricking my fingers, crying every time I check my blood sugar is higher than it should be.

Turns out we've both liked each other for many years and been to chicken to say anything 😅 . 

Now, here's the problem, neither of us have dated anyone. Like ever. So we don't know when we're doing. We went on a coffee date, and it was great. Since we already know everything about each other, we just chatted and joked. I honestly had a great time. I'm just lost now. Where do we go from here in a relationship when we already know each other? Do we just keep going on dates? What do you even do in a relationship? Just make out n stuff? Also, how do you even know if you love someone romantically? Also we see each other daily and can't express affection in public. How do you keep the spark there?

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old trans woman living in Phoenix, AZ, and I’m looking to connect with people who share some of my passions and interests.  

A little about me:

- **Tennis**: I’m a huge fan of tennis and love hitting the courts whenever I get the chance. Whether you’re a pro or a beginner, I’d be up for a friendly match or just chatting about the sport.  

- **Pop Music**: Pop music is my go-to, and I’m always discovering new artists and tracks. From the classics to the latest hits, I love discussing my favorite songs, albums, or going to concerts. If you're a music lover, I’m all for a good playlist swap!

- **Video Games**: Gaming is one of my favorite ways to unwind. I enjoy a mix of genres—whether it’s strategy games, RPGs, or casual mobile games. I’m always down to talk game mechanics, tips, or just chat about the latest titles.

- **Fitness**: Staying active is really important to me, whether it's going for a run, hitting the gym, or trying out new workout routines. Fitness is a great way to stay energized and motivated, and I’d love to meet others who are into fitness, too.

- **Dogs**: I’m absolutely in love with dogs. If you have a furry friend, I’m sure we’d get along! I enjoy spending time with dogs, whether it's going for walks, playing fetch, or just relaxing with them.

- **Reading**: When I’m not being active or playing games, you can usually find me with a good book in hand. I enjoy reading all sorts of genres, from fiction to self-improvement books. I’d love to swap book recommendations or start a little book club if that sounds fun!

If you’re in the Phoenix area (or even not), and any of these things sound like something you’d be into, feel free to reach out. Whether you want to chat about our shared interests, go for a hike, grab a coffee, or something more, I’m open to connecting.

**A bit more personal**: I prefer men sexually, but if you’re a woman who’s looking for a trans friend to hang out with, you’re more than welcome to contact me too!

Its hard to believe a year has passed for the coffee shop and restaurant. The first branch is going surprisingly well, like any business it has its problems. Main one is and I think always will be staff, we now only have one left of the original 5 I hired. One we dismissed after repeat warnings regarding her time keeping, being late when your the opener repeatedly, some times 30-40mins 3 or 4 times aweek was not sustainable. In hindsite I let it drag on to long and should have acted sooner.

One we dismmised for theft after going through the CCTV, in one week we looked she didn't ring up around 35 drinks on the till and pocketed the money.

Our chef got to big for his boots and decided he was going to dictate his own terms especially when he didn't get his own way. It accumulated in him deciding to take his lunch hour at our busiest time of day leaving the place full of hungry unhappy customers. 

The other one just could not be separated from her mobile phone, even putting it down to serve customers became to much of a chore. In the end i banned her from the staff wifi so she used all the customers vouchers before we let her go.

Turn over is good, its increasing month on month still with a good regular customer base. Profits are above forecast and out of the 13 months we have been open have not had one month where we traded negative. We still have plenty of ideas to drive it forward and it should be an exciting year ahead. We now have 3 franchise's operating with another 4 that will be opening in the first quarter. 


The spa business....

This has been open 16 months now and really is a simple business to run. We have a staff of 5 and open 10 hours a day 7 days a week. Again we have a good customer base and do more of the more complicated procedures, including tattoo removal, gluta drips, botox, carbon facials, lazer hair removal and many other procedures. 

Again staff have been the main problem. We notice we had lost more than a few regular clients only to discover our manager had opened her own part-time spa and was stealing our customers and products . We terminated her employment and with in 4 weeks with  the loss of her main salary she could not afford to keep her own business viable. 

Turn over has remained good but growth is now stagnent. We have invested heavily in the best equipment but space is now hampering growth, we have just plain and simply out grown our present location. The hunt has started for premisse with over 2 times the floor space.

Profits are strong, its an easy to  manage business, requires very little on going stock and is causing very few issues on a daily basis.

Follow your dreams guys and girls, you may not get rich running your own business, but working for some one else you certainly wont !

Yeah, same. Turns out, interactive content can boost engagement by **over 50%**, and summaries keep readers from bouncing—but who has the time?

# The struggle: quizzes and summaries take forever

* **Quizzes** keep readers hooked, but writing them manually is a pain.
* **Summaries** help retention, but summarizing your own post is like trying to edit your own novel—you either over-explain or cut too much.
* Most WordPress plugins? Not much help unless you enjoy tedious work.

# The fix: one-click automation

What if you could generate quizzes and summaries **instantly**? No brainstorming, no rewriting—just **click, review, publish**. Our plugin reads your post, grabs the key points, and turns them into:  
✅ **Engaging quizzes** (not just “Which pizza topping are you?” nonsense)  
✅ **Concise summaries** so readers stay longer and bounce less

# More engagement, less effort

* **Better SEO**: Google loves longer sessions.
* **Happier readers**: Get the info they need, fast.
* **More time for you**: Finally take that coffee break.

Stop wasting hours—automate the busywork and focus on what actually matters! 🚀

Dank u wel!

1ipysia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/1ipysia/worried_ill_be_single_forever/,Worried I'll be single forever,"I was diagnosed with endo when I was in a 5 year relationship and it had taken its toll on our intimacy. My partner was extremely unsupportive and eventually became emotionally abusive about it. It eventually it ended our relationship (of my decision).. I have tried to date many times since, but the pain -- even only at careful masturbation and pelvic floor PT -- hurts a lot. My doctors are trying to sort it out but we think there's also some connective tissue issues adding to the challenges. 
I've gotten really good at calmly having ""the endo discussion"" when it becomes relevant with people I've been seeing. However, they either ghost me right away then, or once it becomes a reality and intimacy goes poorly they break up or ghost me immediately. That's the only issue and they're suddenly gone. This is maybe 8 to 10 guys by now. 
I turn 29 in a few days and I just can't help thinking I'm going to be single for my life with my dog. I love my dog, but I want someone to cuddle and chat and laugh watching a movie with, to share morning coffee with and chat about our days, adopt kids with.. I want a human partner to share my life with. Every time I get ghosted or broken up with due to my endo it makes it harder to just try again and keep hope the right person is out there.I tried taking a break from dating to recharge then try again but that didn't help when all I returned to was the same outcomes. I am comfortable on my own and could be okay single, but it's not what I want long term. 

I know ""the right person is out there"" is typically the support you get on here, and I'm sure for some it's true. I just didn't expect to be almost 30 and single or fighting a dumb chronic pain disease. I just feel so defeated 😞 also I know 30 isn't old, I just really expected my life to be different. 

My therapist is great but I'm sure she's getting sick of my failed dating life and same issue coming up again and again.. either that or she lives for the drama 😅. Its helpful to have her, but I wish there was a support group near me. There isn't anything in my province for any kind of chronic pain support groups. My friends also don't get it as they've never had health issues impact relationships at all, or really have physical disabilities at all. My therapist is really all I've got to help and I appreciate her, but it's still so disheartening going through this again and again. ",7,1739616026.0,Endo,1,1.0,False

At least that's what my sister (34F) apparently thinks. 

I (27F) work from hoe at a pretty high-wire job, so my day consists of Zoom meetings, deadlines, and faking like m internet is on the fritz when someone asks me to do some overtime. My sister has three sweet but wild kids  (6M, 4F, 2M), and asked me to ""lend a hand"" and babysit during the day since I'm ""just at home anyway.""

I told her, very nicely, that I actually do work during work hours. She responded with, "" But you don't even have to leave your house."" Right, and surgeons don't need to leave the OR, but you don't catch them sitting on a couch playing peekaboo with a baby while cracking oepn someone's chest. 

Now she's all mad at me, saying I don't get how hard it is to raise kids and I should want to lend a hand. My mom had to jump in with, too, saying, ""You have the time, you just don't want to help."" You got me, Mom. I am stashing my time like a dragon hiding treasure, yes.

So, AITAH for not hijacking my home office into a daycare facility, or do I just bust out the stopwatch and start charging my sister $25 an hour and call it a side hustle?",57,1739615980.0,AITAH,51,0.91,False

1ipyr74,https://www.reddit.com/r/MazzerPhilosQuestions/comments/1ipyr74/cup_quality/,Cup quality,"I know I would’ve appreciated this type of info before so I’ll add it myself for those who are interested. I have bought the Philos and received it yesterday, and so far it’s the best grinder I’ve had. For the background I have Eureka Mythos Plus, Santos Type 4, 1Zpresso K Ultra and just sold my Eureka Silenzio. 

I was afraid that Philos will be marginally better than K Ultra since K is top of the line hand grinder, but I was wrong. K was nice, but just that. I could say to my wife oh this coffee smells sweet and tastes nice, but in terms of picking up flavours, there weren’t that many I could distinctly pin point. Fruit flavours were there, but for example I couldn’t find any hazelnut or milk chocolate for one beans from the Square Mile. Now hazelnut distinctly jumps at me  with clarity where you would not think is this hazelnut? It’s HAZELNUT. Honey notes are also distinct, which wasn’t the case with K Ultra. 

in terms of Santos, it’s an older flat burr shop grinder and it was designed more for speed rather than consistency. It was decent enough and would say was similar to K Plus, maybe more silkiness in the cup and slightly different nature of taste, but I had a few cups with bitterness and they would be random, mixed with nice cups, but not much flavour wise. Philos is wayy better.

Can’t comment much on Silenzio since I was not drinking speciality beans at that time and my water was tap, but I was enjoying coffee with milk.

Mythos is amazing but double the size of Philos. Still can’t decide which espresso is better, but I’ve only tried it twice.

Anyway if you wanna know more let me know. Hopefully this has helped

1ipyl3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1ipyl3w/overheard_my_dad_talking_shit_about_me_last_night/,Overheard my Dad talking shit about me last night,"I (22M) feel like my parents are some of the most miserable people in the world, any positivity they exude is something I had to squeeze out of them like popping a spot. They spend all their free time watching shit on TV and I mean full on garbage, I overhear it whenever I'm cooking or making coffee or whatever; FOX news right wing political bullshit, stupid TikTok type things, lately they started watching car crash compilations.

My Mom watches the same few shows in rotation mixed with whatever random crap amazon Prime or Netflix feeds her. My Dad spends the evenings drinking and watching M*A*S*H. I had to stop counting how many cans he drinks because it just upsets me, 8 cans a day is him drinking in moderation. He's destroying his body and is already on medication for cholesterol and blood pressure and heart problems, I don't see him reaching 80. My Mom, and my Dad too, both seem resigned from any joy in life. Like they can't be bothered to have fun, euphoria exhausts them.

My Dad fustrates me he'll imply I should be able to drink, and mention how the non alcoholic beers I drink now are pointless. He's very subtle about it, I'm guessing it makes him feel bad about himself, as if he knows deep down his habitutal drinking is a problem, but he probably justifies it by telling himself he only drinks in the evenings so it's fine, it doesn't matter that he drinks a dozen beers a night.

My Mom should have left my Dad years ago, I wonder if she's just staying now because she's 60 and nothing better is going to come along, so she might as well make the most of it. I get the feeling she hates her life, and regrets everything. When she met my Dad it seems like her life all but stopped. And I'm the ball and chain that kept her here, maybe she pushed the idea of leaving out of her head for my sake. Maybe she does genuinely love him and I'm totally wrong, but I haven't ever seen them kiss, or tell them they love each other.

I thought this was just normal English reservedness (we're an English family living in Texas, been here since I was 12), but then I see the internal workings of other families and it's not like this. My girlfriend's parents appear to actually like each other, and there's some semblance of family unity with them.  My family household feels like 3 flatmates that don't hate each other, but also just kinda want nothing to do with one another.

My Dad is the worst for it, he's never really bothered with trying to bond with me. I learned the guitar which he always wanted me to do, and I asked him to be in a band with me or at least work on music together and he wasn't interested. Your kid is trying to form a relationship with you for fuck sake, sorry I even asked. I barely even bother talking to him now, whenever I do it feels like to co-workers trying to make smalltalk, I hate it, I should have some feeling of a father figure in my life considering my Dad has been in the same house as me all my life. I might as well have been raised via visitation.

I remember a year or two ago I listed every single positive memory I have with either of my parents, and I'm counting literally everything, it came out to about 20 things. And half of those were when everyone in this house used to drink and we'd get drunk together, or them saying something that made me feel better, not like there were 20 super wonderful memories for life. None of them were that.

Yesterday I was in bed trying to go to sleep, and I could hear my Dad venting to my Mum about how shit and useless I am, basically everything I do that annoys him. But he's never bothered stepping in as a parental figure to guide me onto a better path, or to improve myself, he's never bothered to tell me these greivances he has with me. I have to do it all myself, I always have to pull myself out, I have to do everything, I have to solve all my own issues without even a semblance of guidance. He's never bothered to offer help with anything I've ever done, and it's not that I need it, I can sort myself out, but it's sad that I have to every single time, isn't a father supposed to raise his child?

I don't remember him ever being there for me during my divorce (long story basically the south doing what the south does), he'd take little pot shots at my ex wife whilst I was in the immediate aftermath of my divorce, but that's it. And to be honest I don't like that, it just comes off as him being a phoney person when he pretended to like her all that time. Never got any advice on handling a break up, never bothered to talk to me or try and make me feel better, it's like my life just happens somewhere else somewhere far away where it doesn't affect him. My Mom tried a little bit, but I still felt like it was just up to me and obviously it is, but you can see your kid is having a rough time of it and you're doing nothing. I started to drink more and more, and be more more blatant about smoking, I used to smoke inside all the time almost as a cry for help, I just wanted someone to notice I was suffering.",13,1739615084.0,emotionalneglect,1,0.94,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! ) 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**
