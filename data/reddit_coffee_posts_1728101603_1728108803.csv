1fwjw8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fwjw8l/just_got_diagnosed_experiencing_some_doubt_but/,"Just got diagnosed. Experiencing some doubt, but mostly just letting it out.","I (36M)  just finished my assessment and was diagnosed as pretty clearly autistic. I brought my wife and my oldest friend in the world. Accepting my therapist's advice to look into it was hard. I don't consider myself very socially anxious. I do avoid eye contact with strangers as I don't appreciate the way they stare expectantly at you. I generally feel I have a fine grasp on most social things, but I generally prefer to do things my own way and opt out of the social game. I love pursuing my own interests and find them incredibly fulfilling. I've always felt a sort of disconnect with most people. Like there's a subtle language barrier that I don't have access to, and keeps me from forming deep relationships with coworkers. That's largely fine with me. They can go their paths and I can go mine. I'd rather pursue my video games, my anime, playing Souls games, fighting games and watching basketball. I find a very deep fulfillment in these things and hope to do them the rest of my life. It didn't really truly occur to me the idea of being autistic until I sat in the room.

  
What I'm not is a completely asocial person. I broadly understand social rules and adhere to them to the extent that I feel is adequate. I often find myself repeating the same responses to keep clients from staring at me while I try to help them. It's boring, but at least it's logistically pretty easy. I'm at peace not being the type of person everyone can get along with. 

  
Now for what I am. I am otherworldly picky. My home is clean, full of materials I like, with the lighting I like. I control the thermostat, and don't like cold lights whatsoever. I hate natural light in my gaming room, and cringe when my wife opens the curtains in the living room. I only buy Nike Dri Fit socks, in black, only wear American Eagle 24/7 joggers and Banana Republic Traveler pants. I wear socks indoors because the inconsistency of the floor texture between my living room and my bathroom annoys me. I have the same single cup of coffee every morning. If my wife doesn't make it, sometimes if I'm stressed, I can't bring myself to make it and wind up going to the coffee shop across the street. When I get home I like to play my game until I feel like stopping, and go to bed at promptly 11pm. I hate crunchy vegetables. I hate goopy and soupy foods or too much condiment. That means no alfredo, avocado, lettuce, raw tomatoes, overly wet rice, over boiled noodles, ramen, and basically anything with a looser texture than chili. 

  
Listening to my wife describe how I fought her tooth and nail over the orientation of the kitchen utensil holder made me feel for her, how finding gifts for me was difficult because I only like things like fictional band T-shirts that aren't branded with the insignia of the series they're from, or some other such esoteric collectible. It was clear that I needed more support than I originally thought.

  
This didn't begin to cover the whole of the appointment, but I felt the deepest sense of relief with the resolution of my neurologist telling me ""this can really only be autism. There's really nothing else that makes any sense"".

1fwjtzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlathvilleUncensored/comments/1fwjtzl/mr_potato_heads_ig_live_full_recap/,Mr. Potato Head's IG Live FULL RECAP,"I was seated and took notes throughout Mr. Potato Head’s IG Live. Enthralling Friday night for me, I know. Matt came with a full mug of hot tea – literally and figuratively – and his friend Miss Angel, who joined the Live shortly after it began. This is my write up of what was discussed, categorized by topics. I’ve included some of the IG Live Chat’s FAQs with Matt’s Frequently Repeated Answers (FRAs).



**Miss Angel**:

Miss Angel is Moriah’s Publicist from LA, Matt introduced Moriah to her. After meeting Moriah she invited the whole family to Beverly Hills to meet. She, with Matt, helped Moriah and her family obtain lawyers to help them with the show’s contracts. Miss Angel owns her own business and provided PR services to Moriah pro bono. They were waiting to hear if the next season was going to get picked up before continuing their work together. She hasn’t heard from her since.

Matt brought her in as a mutual witness to their relationship. She tried to help facilitate the Live by asking discussion questions, but she kept repeating that she never followed the show and, therefore, also kept asking questions like “Who’s Barry?” She does seem like a lovely lady who knows her business well, but I’m not sure she knew what she was getting into with this Live.

 

**Matt (Mr. Potato Head)**:

31-year-old never married, single father and entrepreneur. He makes music on the side; it’s a hobby. He says other than attending a wedding, he’s NEVER WORE A SUIT BEFORE HIS WHOLE LIFE. He claims he is a polos and khakis kind of businessman. He was once engaged to the mother of his child but they grew apart. He doesn’t practice religion “but loves god.” Someone in the chat asked if he was bi and he said he wasn’t but suggested Micah may be (yes, I’m for real). He thinks he’s being stereotyped because of his tattoos.

He said he never wanted to be on the show. Production approached him four times, persuading him with the promise of a wide audience to grow his platform for his music. He always immediately rejected their offers. He does not need nor want a platform. He wants nothing to do with Plathville. Miss Angel says he’s 6’3” or 6’4”.

 

**Relationship with Moriah**:

When they met, Moriah wasn’t in a good place “mentally, physically, spiritually, or emotionally.” She worked across the street from his office and always looked really sad.

She told him she was getting over being homeless and needed stable money. He brought her in for a job interview but she bawled her eyes out. So, he helped her out and was a stable person in her life. He tried to give her what her family wasn’t providing for her, like money for her to feed herself and her dog. They did not date: “I NEVER ASKED HER TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.” He says they never hooked up.

Apparently, Moriah was very confused as to why their relationship hadn’t gone further. Then she found out he had a child and felt betrayed since he hadn’t told her himself. He says he felt like keeping his personal life private, especially since she was in the public eye. He thinks she lashed out because she felt rejected by him. Miss Angel confirms they never claimed to be dating. He said it could’ve gone somewhere if her family hadn’t started stalking him. They’re friends now, though. They talked yesterday on the phone for an hour. He isn’t sure if they’ll date in the future. She’s never met his son. 

**FAQ**: Were you going to the concert?

**FRA**: No, he was not going to the concert.

 

**Moriah**:

She was broken, fragile when they met. He says she is a sweetheart. Moriah is misguided because she’s a product of her environment, which is confusion.

Moriah knew he was doing this and was texted an invite, but she was working. He says she removed herself from online because she is struggling with a lot. Decided to go to therapy. He encourages her and checks in with her. He is proud of her for seeking help in therapy.

He was very disappointed with Moriah and the statements she made on TV. She knew he had certain boundaries and crossed them, so they talked about it and she’s working on it in therapy. He says, “she needs people that comfort her instead of people that shame.”

**FAQ**: is Moriah on drugs?

**FRA**: No, Moriah is not on drugs. 

 

**The Plath Family**:

He says there’s so much that goes on in that family behind the scenes.

Veronica, Kim, Micah, and Ethan are the family's ringleaders. He has no issues with Barry, Lydia, Issac, or the three younger girls.

His issue with the family: they don’t look out for her best interest

The family isn’t wealthy. They don’t make much money from the show – Matt estimates about the same amount as a teacher’s salary, but Angel says it’s less than that.

Her family stalked and harassed him. They were invasive and overwhelming. They project themselves onto him.

He claims to have a lot of juicy gossip he wants to say but is biting his tongue (for now).

He’s met the whole family (except Hosanna…)

The family is “very toxic and intoxicating.”

**FAQ**: Why won’t her family help Moriah?

**FRA**: “I think Her family won’t give her money because they don’t have money.”

 

**Kim**

Kim betrayed her trust to the family and kids. Kim cheated on Barry and left the family.

He’s never seen Kim drink, but he laughed at all the Kim drinking jokes in the chat.

He met with Kim for two hours at his office. Kim asked him to hook her up with some rich dude. “Kim flirts with everybody she meets.”

  

**Barry**

Barry sat on Matt’s kitchen table man-to-man and grilled him: Were you married? Were you dating my daughter?

Matt told him everything and Barry immediately apologized for the mean things he said on the show. Barry texts him sometimes still.

**FAQ**: Is Barry single?

**FRA**: Barry is single

  

**The Parking Lot Confrontation with Ethan (from the finale)**

Why was Moriah in his car? She texted him and asked if he wanted to go get coffee. He picked her up and was about to pull off to Starbucks when Ethan came up to the window and demanded Moriah get out of the car. Ethan’s approach was apparently aggressive, but Matt returned the aggression, so Ethan backed down.

**FAQ**: Did you tell Moriah not to talk to Ethan anymore?

**FRA**: No. Moriah complained about Ethan constantly begging her for money, so he said she should ignore Ethan until he stopped.

 

**Veronica, Kim’s BFF**

Veronica is stalking the mother of his child!!! Kim is stalking her too!! They’re both harassing everyone in his inner circle!!! He thinks Veronica or Kim is responsible for the leak of his child’s name. He’s convinced the reddit forums are created by Veronica. He had no Veronica tea other than how much she’s harassed him and the people around him.

He says Kim favors Veronica.

 

**Micah**!!!!

MICAH “CHEATED ON VERONICA 50 TIMES WITH BOTH—” he cut himself off. He insists Micah and Veronica both need an STD test.

**FAQ**: How does he know about Micah cheating?

**FRA**: He has screenshots of women Micah has hooked up with and suggests he might leak them if the Plath’s don’t leave him alone.

**FAQ**: Is Micah gay?

**FRA**: “I’m not sure if Micah is gay, ask him.”

 

**Hosanna**

This man had no fucking clue about her. He initially thought she was the youngest daughter until he remembered she’s the eldest daughter who “lives in Minnesota with the Amish.” WRONG.

 

**Olivia**

He never met or spoke to Olivia, but he stands by her opinions of the family. Now that the Plaths have treated him like they treated her, Matt understands why Olivia wants nothing to do with them.

 

**He brought up a couple potential reasons why the Plaths didn’t like him:**

·      Because he’s half-black. He says, “it’s the only explanation to why certain things are going on.”

·      Because he pointed out how much of a problem the family is. ""Even Barry admitted"" he was right about their family's toxicity!

  

**On why he’s making a statement at all**:

He was going to remain silent on this whole thing, but this morning he received a screenshot from Reddit of court documents with his child’s name on it. He understands they’re public records, but “what’s the point of posting them on public forums when a child is involved, and the child deserves nothing but privacy?”

  

**Production**:

He talked to producers before the release of the show, specifically a woman with an English accent, who promised him they would remove a lot from the show because they didn’t know Moriah lied about their relationship. Producers said he wouldn’t even be mentioned on the show and that “everything was scrubbed by legal.”

 

**Will we see him on TV**?

DOESN’T WANT TO BE ON THE NEW SEASON and he hasn’t watched the show. He did confirm they start filming a new season at the end of this year.

 

**What’s next?**

He is suing the whole family and the show for defamation. He says we will never hear from him again.

**FAQ**: Was that him on the Reddit AMA?

**FRA**: Who? No. He doesn’t use Reddit or know about it beyond the screenshots sent to him.

 

**On “Mr. Potato Head”**

He thinks he’s cuter than Mr. Potato Head. He doesn’t care to be called that and says it’s not bad because everyone loves French fries and tater tots.

1fwjtw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_crimsondrafts/comments/1fwjtw1/chapter_3/,Chapter 3 ,"The café was Isla’s unofficial office—its warm, dimly lit corners providing a cozy hideaway where she could bury herself in writing. The hum of low chatter, the clinking of mugs, and the rich scent of freshly brewed coffee created the perfect backdrop for a writer in need of inspiration. Except today, inspiration seemed as far away as her unsold books back at the bookstore.

Isla sipped her latte, her fingers idly tapping the side of her mug as she stared at the blank page on her laptop. Words weren’t coming today. Her thoughts kept circling back to him. That stranger from the bookstore. The way he had dropped into her life like a puzzle piece she didn’t realize was missing.

She had spent a good half-hour after their conversation wondering why it felt so unfinished, like a book you can’t put down but also can’t quite solve. And now, here she was, struggling to focus on anything but that lingering sense of curiosity.

The door to the café swung open, and Isla glanced up without thinking. Her fingers stilled on her keyboard.

It was him.

The man from the bookstore—casually stepping into the café as if the universe had decided to play a little joke on her. He hadn’t noticed her yet. He moved to the counter, exchanged pleasantries with the barista, and ordered something—black coffee, she guessed. He didn’t seem like a latte type.

Her pulse quickened. She could pretend she hadn’t seen him, just hide behind her laptop and avoid another strange encounter. Or she could acknowledge the sheer ridiculousness of running into him again and say something.

Before she could decide, he turned, eyes sweeping the room—and then they landed on her.

Isla blinked, and their eyes locked. A flicker of recognition crossed his face, and then he smiled. That same easy, slightly knowing smile from the bookstore, like running into her was the most natural thing in the world. He raised his coffee in a mock salute and walked over, taking the seat across from her as if they’d done this a hundred times before.

“Fancy seeing you here,” he said, settling into the chair. “Or should I be worried you’re following me?”

Isla chuckled, shaking her head. “I was about to ask you the same thing. Seems like you have a knack for showing up unannounced.”

He grinned, a little wider this time. “Maybe I’m just good at being in the right place at the right time. Or maybe you attract interesting company.”

“Interesting, huh?” She raised an eyebrow, leaning back in her seat. “Is that what you are?”

His smile widened, but he didn’t answer right away. Instead, he took a sip of his coffee, eyes never leaving hers. “What can I say? I like bookstores. And cafés.”

“And unsolicited advice on murder methods,” she added, smirking.

He laughed softly. “Hey, if I see a problem, I like to help. Consider it a professional courtesy.”

“Oh, it’s professional now?” Isla asked, tilting her head. “What exactly do you do?”

There was a pause, a subtle shift in the air. His smile didn’t falter, but there was something in his eyes—something that flickered and then disappeared before she could read it.

“I clean up,” he said, his tone light but cryptic.

Isla frowned, thrown off by the answer. “Clean up? Like… a janitor?”

“Not quite,” he replied, leaning back in his chair. “More like I deal with messes other people don’t want to think about.”

She stared at him, unsure whether to take him seriously or not. His words hung in the air, vague and teasing, but with enough weight to make her wonder. Was he messing with her, or was there something more behind his calm demeanor?

“And you’re good with that?” she asked, her curiosity winning out over her hesitation.

He nodded, taking another sip of his coffee. “I’m good at what I do. You learn to live with certain things.”

Isla swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. She couldn’t tell if he was being cryptic on purpose or if this was just how he was, always leaving things unsaid. She was tempted to press him further, but something told her she wouldn’t get any straight answers.

“And you never told me your name,” she said, changing tactics.

He paused, and for a second, she thought he might deflect again. But then he leaned forward slightly, his gaze steady on hers. “Names are tricky, don’t you think? Sometimes they’re not as important as people think.”

Isla raised an eyebrow, her curiosity deepening. “That’s a convenient way to avoid answering the question.”

He chuckled, his smile returning. “I’m Cade.”

“Cade,” she repeated, testing the name on her tongue. “Nice to meet you, Cade. I’m Isla. Since you seem to enjoy these random meetings, I figured we should at least get the introductions out of the way.”

Cade gave her a nod, almost as if he were humoring her. “Nice to meet you too, Isla.”

There was a moment of silence, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It felt more like the calm before something deeper, a shared pause between two people trying to figure out exactly what the other was hiding.

“So, what are you working on today?” Cade asked, nodding toward her laptop.

Isla glanced at the screen, still blank, and let out a small, self-deprecating laugh. “Oh, you know. Just staring at a blank page and pretending it’s productive.”

He smirked, leaning back in his chair. “Sounds like progress. Or is this more of that ‘overthinking’ you mentioned last time?”

“Probably both,” she admitted, rubbing her temples. “It’s like I have all these ideas floating around in my head, but I can’t get any of them to land on the page.”

Cade tilted his head, watching her for a moment. “Maybe you’re trying too hard to control it.”

Isla frowned, looking up at him. “What do you mean?”

He shrugged. “You’re trying to make it perfect, right? But real life isn’t perfect. It’s messy, unpredictable. Maybe your writing would flow better if you let go of some of that control. Let things fall apart.”

Isla stared at him, processing his words. There was something strangely poetic about the way he talked, as if he understood the messiness of life in a way she didn’t. Or maybe she was just looking for meaning in his cryptic remarks. Either way, she couldn’t help but feel like there was more to him than he was letting on.

“You sound like you’ve seen things fall apart up close,” she said, half-joking but with a sliver of real curiosity.

Cade smiled, but there was a flicker of something darker in his eyes. “Maybe I have.”

Her heart skipped a beat, though she wasn’t sure why. She wanted to ask more, to dig into his past and find out exactly what he meant, but before she could, Cade stood up, sliding his hands into his pockets.

“I’ll leave you to it,” he said, nodding toward her laptop. “Wouldn’t want to distract you from all that blank page progress.”

Isla smiled, though her mind was still spinning. “Thanks for stopping by. And for the… advice.”

He gave her a small nod, that same unreadable smile on his lips. “Anytime. I’ll be around.”

With that, he turned and walked out of the café, leaving her with more questions than answers. She watched him go, her mind racing, trying to piece together the puzzle that was Cade. There was something about him—something she couldn’t quite put her finger on—but whatever it was, she knew she wasn’t done trying to figure it out.

1fwjsij,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1fwjsij/food_vendor_scamming_customers/,Food vendor scamming customers?,"Not sure where else to ask about this, so Reddit it is. The other night I ordered from a place called GoodSteak near where I live (ordered through Postmates).

The only item of note they sell is a ""10 oz New York Strip"" steak. You also have an option to ""Buy 1, Get 1 Free.""  I went with the ""Buy 1, Get 1 Free"" option expecting 20 oz of meat.

When the food is delivered I unpack it and notice that the ""10 oz"" feels a little light. I order meat often (Fogo De Chao, Wood Ranch Grill, Tender Greens, Bludso's, Holy Cow, etc.) so I know what 16 oz or 10 oz of meat feels like. I weigh the meat on my coffee bean scale and sure enough it's only 5 oz. I weigh the second portion and it's the same, exactly 5 oz.

I thought it was an honest mistake and since the place is close to where I live I went there in person. When I inquired about the discrepancy I was told by the guy at the counter (not sure what his function is there - cashier? Owner?) that the steaks are 10 oz prior to cooking, but after the fat is trimmed off and the steak is cooked it only ends up weighing about 5 oz - basically trying to convince me that half of the original meat magically disappears when it's cooked.

I've grilled meat before many times, that's not what happens at all. And even if it did, that's not how selling meat by weight works.

At this point I don't want to deal with this place anymore and start heading out. The guy wants to appease me and asks to wait 10 minutes so he can make things right. I politely decline, but he insists. So I wait there for 10 minutes and he brings out another order of meat and apologizes. I thank him and leave. When I get home, I weigh the portions he just gave me, and sure enough they are also both 5 oz.

By the way the meat is just mediocre, and was also overcooked and over-seasoned.

So in the end, I got what I paid for, 20 oz of steak as promised on the menu, but only because I went there to inquire about my order. But how many unaware/uniformed people get scammed by this place?

Am I overreacting? Does this happen often and nobody cares? Is something like this even legal? Can I report them anywhere?",2,1728108098.0,FoodLosAngeles,0,1.0,False

1fwjm1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_crimsondrafts/comments/1fwjm1h/chapter_1/,Chapter 1 ,"The rain outside fell in sheets, pattering against the windows of Pages & Scribes like fingers drumming an impatient beat. Isla Harper, perched behind her small folding table at the back of the store, felt as though each drop counted down the moments of her slow descent into literary irrelevance.

It wasn’t that she hated small bookstores. On the contrary, she preferred them. The smell of old paper, the soft shuffle of browsing customers, the distant hum of quiet conversations—it was the kind of place where, in the past, she would lose hours, tucked away in a corner with a well-worn book in hand.

But today, the familiar coziness of the shop felt suffocating. The flickering fluorescent lights overhead cast a yellowish glow, harsh against the polished wooden shelves and the faded, threadbare carpet beneath her feet. The ambiance that once felt inviting now seemed indifferent, as if even the store itself was uninterested in her presence.

A neat stack of her latest novel, Blood of Betrayal, sat in front of her, its dark cover glistening under the artificial light. No one had touched it. No one had even glanced in its direction. It had been three hours since she’d set up her table, and she hadn’t signed a single copy.

She took a sip from her coffee, grimacing as the cold, bitter liquid hit her tongue. Her fingers itched to check her phone again, but she resisted the urge. The last time she’d opened it, she’d been greeted by another lackluster review—someone named “BookwormBeth” calling her murder scenes “bland and unrealistic,” which had stung in ways she didn’t want to admit.

Murder was supposed to be her bread and butter, her thrill and twist, but lately, every death she wrote felt sanitized. She could write the tension, the suspense, the intricate web of lies that her characters spun, but when it came to the actual act of violence, the part readers seemed to crave most, her words felt flat. The visceral thrill of the kill, the rawness of it, eluded her.

Her gaze flicked up from her coffee to the door, where the bell chimed softly as another potential customer entered the shop. A woman in her mid-thirties, juggling an umbrella and a dripping raincoat, stepped inside, shaking the water from her hair. Isla’s eyes followed her as she wandered between the shelves, her movements casual, unhurried.

The woman didn’t look toward Isla’s table.

Isla slouched back in her chair, folding her arms across her chest. She could feel the dull ache creeping into her neck, the kind that came from sitting too long in one place with nothing to do. She leaned her head back, staring up at the ceiling, the buzzing lights above her an irritating constant, like a gnat she couldn’t swat away.

“Maybe I’m just not cut out for this,” she muttered to herself, tapping her fingers absently on the tabletop. The thought had been nagging at her for months now, a quiet, persistent whisper at the back of her mind. Maybe she’d reached her peak, and this was all she had to offer—a few novels that had been decently received but would ultimately fade into obscurity.

She glanced over at the small poster the store had printed for the event. Meet Isla Harper, Author of Blood of Betrayal. The suspense novel you won’t be able to put down! It felt like a mockery now, the words overly bold, their promises unfulfilled.

A deep sigh escaped her, and she ran a hand through her hair, loosening the tight bun she’d pinned at the back of her head earlier that morning. There was no point in pretending anymore. This event was a bust.

As she reached for her phone—surrendering to the inevitable scroll through Twitter—her fingers froze mid-reach. The door chimed again, the soft ring cutting through the gentle murmur of the store, and Isla found herself glancing up, almost instinctively.

A man had stepped inside, his presence immediately noticeable not because he did anything to draw attention, but because of the stillness that seemed to follow him. He wasn’t particularly tall or imposing, but there was something in the way he stood just inside the threshold, his hands slipping out of his pockets and brushing the rain from his jacket, that made Isla pause.

He didn’t look around the store the way other customers did. He didn’t browse or let his eyes flick lazily over the shelves. He simply stood for a moment, taking in the room, as if assessing it, and then quietly moved further inside, his steps measured and deliberate.

He was in no rush, it seemed. Just like everyone else who wandered in, maybe to escape the rain or kill time. But still, there was something different about him. Something Isla couldn’t quite put her finger on. She shook the feeling off as soon as it crept in, telling herself she was just bored, desperate for something to hold her interest on this otherwise uneventful afternoon.

Her eyes tracked him for a moment longer before she pulled her attention back to the table in front of her. No need to get distracted by another customer who wouldn’t even glance at her books.

She checked the time. Three more hours to go.

God, please let someone buy a book soon.

She stared at the cover of Blood of Betrayal again, wondering for the hundredth time that week if it was too late to change careers. Maybe she’d missed her calling as a baker or a graphic designer. People seemed happier doing those jobs. People didn’t leave nasty comments about cupcakes or business logos.

The soft shuffle of footsteps interrupted her thoughts. She looked up again, startled to see the man now standing not far from her table, scanning the nearby shelves with mild interest.

She watched him out of the corner of her eye. He moved slowly, his fingers brushing against the spines of the books, his gaze sweeping over the titles without lingering on any one in particular. He wasn’t browsing, not really. More like… searching. Or waiting.

Isla straightened a little, clearing her throat, though she wasn’t sure why. Maybe she hoped he’d turn and look her way. Maybe he’d glance at her book. Maybe he’d ask her about it. She could use a conversation with someone who wasn’t just looking for the bathroom.

But he didn’t. Instead, he paused by the shelf closest to her, plucking a thin, worn paperback from the top row. He flipped it open, casually turning the pages, but there was no real interest in his movements. More like a habit, something to pass the time.

Isla’s curiosity flared again, but she kept her mouth shut. There was something off about him—something unsettling in his casual demeanor, his deliberate movements. It wasn’t anything obvious, nothing she could point to. Just a feeling. A vague sense of unease.

Her phone buzzed again, dragging her attention away. She glanced down at the screen and saw an email from her editor sitting in her inbox, the subject line simply reading: “We Need to Talk.”

Perfect, she thought, her stomach sinking. That was exactly what she needed right now.

She opened the email, skimming the first few lines, but before she could get too far, she felt eyes on her. When she looked up, the man had turned, his gaze now resting on her.

For a moment, neither of them said anything. He closed the book in his hand, setting it back on the shelf, and took a step closer to her table.

“Author event?” he asked, his voice low, smooth.

Isla blinked, surprised by how the question cut through the quiet. “Yeah,” she said, her voice coming out softer than she intended. She cleared her throat. “That’s me. I’m the author.”

He smiled—a small, polite smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Looks like it’s a slow day.”

“You could say that.” Isla glanced down at the pile of books on her table, her lips curving into a wry grin. “I’m starting to think I could just take these home and use them as doorstops.”

He chuckled, the sound short but genuine, and Isla’s tension eased just a little. She wasn’t sure why she felt so on edge.

“Blood of Betrayal,” he said, reading the title off the stack. “Sounds intense.”

“It’s supposed to be,” Isla replied, leaning forward slightly. “Lots of suspense, lots of murder. You know, the usual.”

He tilted his head, his eyes darkening just a fraction. “How do you make it feel real?”

Isla blinked, caught off guard by the question. “What do you mean?”

“The murders,” he said, his tone casual. “How do you make them feel real?”

A few days had passed since Jon’s night out with Kara, and the weight of his double life hung heavier than ever. He had spent the days lost in thought, wondering if he had made a mistake reconnecting with her. The more he allowed himself to get close, the more he felt trapped by the lies he had to tell. His life with the *Shadows of the Night* demanded secrecy, and getting too close to anyone—especially someone like Kara—was a dangerous game.

But before he could dwell on it further, a message came through from Sara, summoning him to her office. It was time for another mission. The call was expected—Jon knew that downtime in the *Shadows* was always short-lived—but this time, the sense of unease gnawed at him. The missions were becoming more frequent, more personal. Something felt different about this one.

He made his way through the underground halls of the *Shadows* headquarters, the cold, metallic walls a stark contrast to the vibrant city above. The *Shadows* worked in silence, their operations hidden from the public eye, and the corridors reflected that secrecy. Every corner of this facility was built for efficiency, devoid of any personal touch.

As he approached Sara’s office, Jon took a deep breath, preparing himself for whatever new assignment awaited him. The door slid open, and Sara was already seated behind her desk, her sharp eyes focused on a tablet in front of her. She looked up as he entered, her expression as unreadable as ever.

“Jon, take a seat,” Sara said, gesturing to the chair in front of her desk.

Jon sat, his posture tense. He could sense the gravity of the situation before she even spoke.

“We’ve received a new mission,” Sara began, her voice calm and professional, though there was a hint of something more beneath the surface. “This time, it’s a solo operation.”

Jon’s brow furrowed. Solo missions were rare for someone at his level in the *Shadows*, and the fact that he had been chosen made him uneasy. He nodded, waiting for her to continue.

“We have credible intelligence that someone is planning to assassinate the Minister of Defense,” Sara explained. “The details are still vague, but the threat is real. The minister has powerful enemies, both within and outside the Dominion, and we’ve decided to place one of our agents close to him to ensure his safety.”

Jon’s mind raced as he processed the information. Protecting the Minister of Defense was no small task, and the political implications of such a mission were enormous. But why him? There were agents far more qualified for this kind of work—agents who specialized in protection and infiltration.

“Sara,” Jon began, his voice careful, “it’s not that I don’t want to take on this mission, but... there are others who are more qualified than me for something like this. I’m still relatively new. This kind of assignment seems like it would require a veteran.”

Sara leaned back in her chair, a small smile playing at the corners of her lips. “You’re right, Jon. Normally, we would assign a senior agent to a mission of this magnitude. But in this case, we believe you’re the best candidate.”

Jon frowned, confused. “Why me?”

Sara tapped her tablet, then slid it across the desk toward him. “Because the minister is notoriously distrustful of outsiders. He only trusts those within his own inner circle, especially his family.”

Jon’s eyes scanned the tablet, the name displayed on the screen making his heart stop for a moment.

**Lieutenant Kara Voss.**

His mind reeled. Kara wasn’t just attached to the Ministry of Defense; she was directly connected to the minister. And not just any connection—she was his niece.

Jon looked up at Sara, the pieces slowly falling into place. “Kara’s... the Minister of Defense’s niece?”

Sara nodded. “Exactly. Lieutenant Kara Voss has been working closely with the minister as part of his personal detail. She’s not only trusted by him but also serves as a key member of his entourage. With you being close to Kara, the minister won’t be suspicious of your presence. He’ll see you as part of her trusted circle.”

Jon’s stomach twisted. The night out with Kara—the connection they had shared—now felt like a noose tightening around his neck. He hadn’t expected his past with her to catch up with him like this. His heart raced as the implications of the mission settled in. He would have to lie to Kara again, deceive her while pretending to protect the very people she was closest to.

“I understand if this is difficult for you,” Sara said, her voice softening slightly, “but this is why you’re the best fit for the mission. The minister is paranoid, and he won’t trust just anyone. But if Kara vouches for you, you’ll be able to get close without raising any red flags.”

Jon sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the assignment sinking in. He had wanted to keep his distance from Kara after their last meeting, but now the *Shadows* were pulling him right back into her life. He would have to infiltrate the minister’s security team under the guise of protecting him, all while concealing the true nature of his mission. The thought of lying to Kara again, of using her trust to get close to her family, made his stomach churn.

“I get it,” Jon finally said, his voice steady despite the turmoil inside. “I’ll do it.”

Sara’s eyes lingered on him for a moment, as if assessing whether he was truly ready for the task ahead. Then she nodded. “Good. You’ll need to report to the Ministry of Defense tomorrow morning. I’ve already arranged for your credentials to be added to the minister’s security team. Kara will be briefed on your addition.”

Jon stood, his mind still racing with the implications of the mission. As he turned to leave, Sara’s voice stopped him.

“One more thing, Jon.”

He turned back to face her, his expression neutral.

“You’re not just protecting the minister,” Sara said, her voice colder now. “You’re there to gather intelligence. Whoever is planning this assassination has connections we don’t fully understand yet. We need you to find out who they are, and if necessary, eliminate the threat before they strike.”

Jon nodded, the dual nature of the mission clear. He wasn’t just a bodyguard; he was an operative tasked with uncovering and neutralizing a threat that could destabilize the Dominion’s power structure. And he would have to do it all while maintaining the facade of being a trusted ally in Kara’s eyes.

The next day came quickly. Jon arrived at the imposing Ministry of Defense building early in the morning, the city still waking up around him. The towering structure was a symbol of the Dominion’s military might, its exterior sleek and intimidating, with armed guards posted at every entrance. Jon’s heart pounded in his chest as he approached the main gate, flashing the identification that Sara had provided.

The guard scanned his credentials, then nodded, stepping aside to let him pass. Jon took a deep breath and walked through the gates, his mind racing with everything that lay ahead.

Inside the building, the atmosphere was cold and efficient. Officers and soldiers moved with purpose, their uniforms immaculate, their expressions serious. Jon had been in military buildings like this before, but this time felt different. This time, he wasn’t just another soldier. He was here as an infiltrator, a *Shadow* operating in the heart of the Dominion’s power.

He made his way to the briefing room where Kara was waiting, his steps slow and deliberate. He had thought about how he would approach her—how he would play his role as the new addition to the security team. But no matter how much he planned, there was no avoiding the tension that was bound to arise.

When he entered the room, Kara was already there, standing near a holographic display of the minister’s security protocols. She looked up as Jon walked in, her face lighting up with surprise and confusion.

“Jon? What are you doing here?”

Jon forced a smile, keeping his voice light. “I’m your new addition.”

Kara blinked, clearly taken aback. “You? You’re joining the minister’s security team?”

Jon nodded, stepping closer. “Sara said they needed someone who could handle the threat and who had connections here. She thought I’d be a good fit.”

Kara frowned, her eyes scanning his face as if trying to understand what was happening. “I... didn’t know they were adding anyone new.”

“Last-minute decision,” Jon said, his voice calm. “I guess they thought it couldn’t hurt to have another set of eyes on things.”

Kara studied him for a moment longer, then sighed, shaking her head. “Well, I trust you, Jon. But this isn’t exactly what I expected.”

Jon’s heart tightened at her words. The trust in her voice made the weight of his deception even heavier. But there was no turning back now. He had accepted the mission, and now he had to play his part.

“Don’t worry,” Jon said, his smile fading as he adopted a more serious tone. “I’ve got your back.”

Kara nodded, though the uncertainty in her eyes remained. “I hope so. Because things are about to get a lot more dangerous than either of us expected.”

Jon felt a chill run down his spine. He was about to dive deeper into the web of lies, and Kara was now part of the tangled mess.

As they prepared for their first day protecting the Minister of Defense, Jon knew that the hardest part of this mission wasn’t going to be neutralizing the threat—it was going to be facing Kara, knowing that every word out of his mouth was a lie.

The second day dawned with a quiet stillness, the kind that seemed to blanket the entire city of Nova Lux in a rare moment of peace. Jon lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, his mind already racing with thoughts of the mission ahead. The previous day had gone by smoothly enough, his first day officially assigned to the Ministry of Defense’s security detail, working alongside Kara. It had been strange—being so close to her again, sharing conversations as if they were just old friends catching up, all while knowing the secret purpose of his mission.

But today, the weight of what was coming felt heavier.

Just as he was about to get up and prepare for the day, there was a knock on the door.

Jon blinked, glancing toward the clock on the nightstand. It was early—too early for anyone to visit. He sat up and, with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, walked to the door. When he opened it, he found Mark standing in the hallway, grinning from ear to ear, two large suitcases dragging behind him.

“Morning, Jon-boy!” Mark said, his grin never faltering. Without waiting for an invitation, he pushed past Jon, dragging the suitcases into the small apartment. “Thought I’d drop by with some... gifts.”

Jon raised an eyebrow, shutting the door behind him. “Gifts?”

Mark set the suitcases down on the floor and clapped his hands together. “Oh yeah. You’re not gonna want to go to your fancy new job at the Ministry dressed like a regular civilian, are you? I brought everything you ordered.”

Jon had almost forgotten about the gear he had requested through the *Shadows’* supply channels. He’d been too focused on the intricacies of the mission to think about the tools he’d need to complete it. Now, with the suitcases in front of him, reality hit him again—this was not just a protective detail mission. This was infiltration, subterfuge, and—if it came down to it—combat.

Mark, clearly enjoying Jon’s reaction, dropped onto one of the kitchen chairs and leaned back, kicking his feet up onto the small table. “Come on, I’ll make us some breakfast while you check out your new toys.”

Jon smiled slightly at Mark’s casual attitude but didn’t argue. He bent down and unlocked the first suitcase, flipping it open with a soft hiss. His eyes widened as he took in the contents.

Inside was a sleek, black suit made of a bulletproof material so light and flexible it almost looked like regular fabric. Next to it, folded neatly, was a second suit made of a strange, almost shimmering material—this one was thinner, designed to be worn beneath the black suit for additional protection. It was a combination of high-tech armor and cutting-edge surveillance gear, capable of blocking various forms of attack while also embedding advanced listening and hacking devices. Jon reached down, running his hand over the material, feeling the lightweight, smooth texture.

Mark grinned from the kitchen, where he had started brewing coffee. “That black suit’s top of the line. Lightweight, bulletproof, and it can absorb some energy-based attacks. But that other one—that’s your ace in the hole. You wear it under the main suit, and it’s got enough tech in it to make you a walking surveillance system. Listening devices, hacking capabilities, you name it. It can even scramble most detection systems.”

Jon nodded, impressed. The *Shadows* spared no expense when it came to outfitting their operatives.

“And if that wasn’t enough,” Mark continued, his tone smug, “wait till you see the weapons.”

Jon moved to the second suitcase, unlocking it with a soft click and lifting the lid. His breath caught at the sight of the arsenal inside.

Resting neatly within the padded compartments were two plasma swords, their sleek hilts gleaming faintly under the light. These weren’t ordinary weapons—plasma blades were rare and incredibly dangerous, capable of cutting through most materials with ease. Jon lifted one of the swords, testing the weight. It was perfectly balanced, its design streamlined for quick strikes. There were magnetic clamps on the hilts, designed to attach the swords to his back under the suit, concealed but ready for use at a moment’s notice.

Next to the swords were two plasma pistols, their design compact but powerful. Jon knew from the specs that these could penetrate most conventional armor and shields, making them formidable in close-quarters combat. There was also a hunting knife, its blade crafted from a nearly indestructible alloy, honed to a razor edge.

But what caught Jon’s attention the most was the plasma automaton—a lightweight, semi-automatic rifle designed for both close-range and medium-range combat. The weapon was sleek, with a matte-black finish, and built for rapid deployment. It was far more advanced than anything he had ever used before.

Jon stared at the weapons for a moment, the gravity of the mission settling in once again. This wasn’t just about protecting the Minister of Defense from an assassination attempt. This was about infiltration, espionage, and, if necessary, combat. He had to be prepared for anything.

Mark, now holding two plates of scrambled eggs and toast, came over and set one down in front of Jon. “Breakfast is served. You’re gonna need the energy, my friend.”

Jon chuckled, shaking his head at Mark’s ability to keep things light, even in the midst of such serious work. He joined Mark at the kitchen table, the two of them eating in silence for a few moments.

“So,” Mark said between bites, “you ready for this? Solo mission and all?”

Jon paused, setting his fork down. “As ready as I’ll ever be.”

Mark nodded, his playful expression softening slightly. “You’ve got this, Jon. You’re good at this, even if you don’t think so yet. Just remember—you’re not just a bodyguard. You’re there to uncover whoever’s behind the plot. Stay sharp, trust your instincts, and you’ll be fine.”

Jon met Mark’s gaze, appreciating the confidence his friend had in him. He hadn’t known Mark for long, but the guy had a way of cutting through the tension and reminding Jon of his capabilities.

After they finished breakfast, Mark stood, grabbing his jacket and giving Jon a quick clap on the back. “Alright, I’ve got to head back to HQ. Got my own mission to prepare for. You stay safe out there, and don’t forget—if you need backup, we’re never too far away.”

Jon nodded, watching as Mark headed for the door. “Thanks, Mark. I appreciate it.”

Mark grinned over his shoulder. “Anytime, Jon-boy. Go knock ’em dead.”

And with that, he was gone, leaving Jon alone in the quiet apartment.

For a moment, Jon just stood there, staring at the suitcases and the weapons laid out before him. The tools of his trade. The mission ahead would test him, not just physically but mentally. He would be working alongside Kara, lying to her, deceiving her. And all the while, he would be hunting down whoever wanted to kill the Minister of Defense.

Jon shook his head, pushing those thoughts aside. He didn’t have time for doubt. This was the job.

He moved to the bedroom and began preparing for the day. He slipped into the strange, shimmering material of the under-suit first, feeling the cool, smooth fabric against his skin. It clung to him like a second skin, lightweight but durable. Once the under-suit was in place, he pulled on the black suit, its sleek design fitting perfectly over the protective layer.

Jon adjusted the magnetic clamps on his back and attached the two plasma swords, ensuring they were concealed but easily accessible. The plasma pistols went into hidden holsters under his jacket, while the hunting knife was sheathed at his side. He held the plasma automaton for a moment, feeling the power of the weapon in his hands, before deciding to keep it stored for now—too conspicuous to bring on this part of the mission.

Finally, he stood in front of the mirror, fully equipped. The suit looked like a simple, elegant black outfit, but beneath the surface, it was a fortress of protection, surveillance, and weaponry.

Jon took a deep breath, steadying himself. He was ready.

Without another word, he left the apartment and made his way toward the Ministry of Defense. The sun was just beginning to rise over the city, casting long shadows across the streets as he walked. The familiar noise of Nova Lux surrounded him, but today, it felt different. Today, he wasn’t just part of the crowd.

Today, he was a shadow.

The next day Charlie leaves the hotel packs up his things pays the clerk, and drives off to get some food, worried how the case could be connected to the hotel, he starts to think about both the residence and the mysterious men he saw upon leaving his car after his lunch, Charlie forgets his badge and returns to the hotel driving back but as he returns he hears more noises, so Charlie walks toward the back of the hotels hallway & looks onward and walks down the stairs again, he looks around and picks up a dirty 18th century vampiric book that reads “the village of chapel vera,” Charlie is confused but then remembered his old roommate Robert took up residence in Chapelwake a small ghost town that was across from him a few blocks down from the hotel called Chapel haven, so he wonders if chapel vera and Chapelwake are connected within the town. Charlie takes his lighter & sets fire to the book, then returns upstairs so that no one will find it…. The book becomes inflamed hot & blazed but turns green, but notices one of the pages is missing, a distressed Charlie looks around thinking it may still be around here but he cant find anything except dirt & soot, everything has been cleaned & picked thoroughly by the previous owners of the hotel so he leaves the basement gives up on finding the page & runs upstairs. Charlie leaves closing the mysterious door, & goes upstairs only to hear a doorbell from the hotels suite, he walks to the door but realizes he forgot to grab his flashlight picks it up & finds his badge, suddenly he hears a second chime noisier then before he opens the door, he sees what looked like a silhouette of the two men in the window near the entrance, only to find it was Robert with a plate of cookies, “You look like you saw a ghost,” Robert said, Charlie mumbles it was nothing, but questions why the cookies were here, then becomes hungry. “I just made some cookies for the big bake off this week,” he puts the plate down in the kitchen, “Did you ever find what you were looking for?” Yeah Charlie says, he came back to find his badge, & the two walk off into his car to talk about Charlies weird experience within the hotel. The two share a drink & drive off to a gas station fill up the car with gas a few blocks east and sit in the car. Charlie puts his hand over his head obviously struggling to sleep from the prior night but explains to Robert that he feels like he’s being followed. Robert looks concerned but says, “you’re just tired man and from the looks of it haven’t slept well in a few days, you know I don’t believe in these wishy washy ghost stories, get some rest and call me tomorrow.” A concerned Charlie says he wants him to believe me, and asks for help, Robert sighs takes a moment finishes his drink and walks out of the car to pack up both their luggage, the two hug and agree to stay the night at Roberts house, then Robert says he can stay at my place for a bit…. but only if he helps with some errands, then they both walk off to the car leaving the gas station and start driving away to the house.

After the two reach Roberts house they park, and enter the house, afterwords Robert goes back to clean something out of his garage to remove unwanted things from a room, or closet, & gives Charlie his gun and says to be careful, they then spent the weekend cleaning out the garage for a bit, Charlie takes a stool sits down and asks Robert about a book he found called the village of chapel vera, Robert pauses then says he’s never heard of that book before…, then Charlie looks and says its important to the case he is on, as he knows Robert had family from there, Robert stares and gets mad saying he never spoke to his family for several months reminding Charlie to not bring up that story as it was a sensitive topic, & Robert slams the door, Charlie gets up and the two pause with a distressed Robert, and Charlie apologizes for bringing up old wounds, they discuss other things and separate to clear the air, some time later the two men rest at Robert’s house after the long day they get a beer & sit down to eat. Later Charlie sleeps on the couch but has nightmares about the things he saw and the two men he was visited by, Charlie wakes up drinks some scotch then goes back to sleep. The next morning Charlie receives a letter from the caretaker who states he wants to have dinner with him to apologize for the mess at the hotel, a skeptical Charlie shows Robert the letter but Robert thinks it could be a trap, or some money laundering scam. Charlie finishes his breakfast but feels like he has to call his boss & explain that he may need a few more days to figure out whats going on with this case. Charlie hangs up the phone, but is still hungover from the night before stating he needs to get some coffee. He boils some water with the coffee machine, pours it then gets dressed and leaves Robert’s house stating he will only be a few hours. He drives off with his gun and badge and tries to muster up any courage he has to meet with the caretaker.",4,1728107049.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False
1fwjj6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1fwjj6q/passive_aggressive_ssv/,Passive aggressive SSV,"Hey everyone I am a new green bean, been at Starbucks for almost a month and have been enjoying it. But recently in the past two weeks I have run into some issues with a particular SSV. Let’s call her AB.

AB has never interacted in a positive or even neutral way with me. The first day I was on cold bar (On the Saturday 2 for 10, 4 for 20 BTW!) I didn’t add enough Mocha into a venti mocha Frap and when I handed it to her at drive thru she reacted like this: 

“This was supposed to be a mocha Frap… I dont know what THIS is.” And shoved it towards me.

The second instance was when she put me on warming on one of my shifts, and started micromanaging me and acting like I was mentally handicapped. I am autistic so when I ask questions and get that response of her talking down to me and using a very specific tone of “I think you’re a child and need to be treated as much”

It’s SUPER frustrating and ruined my whole shift, in fact so much so I talked to my manager who was in that day, not even 15 minutes after the incident. 

My manager was pretty understanding and explained I was not the only one, and that AB acts frustrated and short when overwhelmed. 

Now on Wednesday I worked a closing and she was there for the first 30 minutes of my shift. And I had mistaken one coffee for another while taking an order at drive thru, and when she got the ticket she came over to me and said “This is not what was ordered, it was an iced coffee, you heard iced coffee right?” And took over the screen from me to edit the order.

Pretty much for those 30 minutes I was there she was also on her phone the whole time, granted we weren’t busy but it seemed kind of odd, especially for someone in that position of a SSV.

Is this valid enough to bring up ONCE again to my manager? I quite frankly do not want any shifts with her whatsoever, and will most likely be calling out if I am on a shift with her. I quite literally have considered changing stores SOLELY because of her and I have been here for less than a month.

Every day I make a list. It is on the counter. Every day he asks me what is on the agenda. My husband uses the royal ""we"" when something needs to be taken care of. So, it goes on my list. Last weekend, he asked me if there was anything that needed to be done in the house. I pointed to the list. He helped me fold laundry that had been sitting in the living room for a week, then went and watched tv. There was more on the list. Sigh. I stood up for myself and told him to back off on telling me to find an alternative solution to my 'expensive' coffee mate. I got 1.5 days of reprieve from it. Then he went on the ""get a job"" rant. I asked him if he was going to nursemaid our son in February while I work, and if he can take him to the hospital, etc. He said, ""M is 18, he can figure that out himself"" Then he gets testy about the job thing again, and I say I am trying to find a way to communicate my thoughts on this to him. He said, ""you don't need to communicate, just get a job."" 

* Riddle me this husband: You want me to do all the things, but work. Get the children up for school in the morning and make sure they are ready, even if it is an hour or two before school starts. Take time off during the day do the things. Have my family pick up my chores because I am working. Go on a vacation in the winter, but get a job. Somehow convince my new employer that I am not a slacker, but I need to take all this time off because I really don't have a husband that will help me. Come home from work and immediately start supper, clean the house and make sure it is a well rounded meal, but it needs to be made before 6pm, because he has an event t go to. I have this ***fantasy*** where I leave the house for 8am and don't get back until 5pm for a week. Make him figure it all out. He needs to get M to school. He needs to go to the appointments. He would find a way to make it sound like I am trying to sabotage his work. He wouldn't last 2 days. 

M was diagnosed with autism in March. It has been a real eye opener, for me. I told my husband 5 days later. He brushed it off and won't discuss what sort of things we need to do to help M. He only sees an 18 year old that 'forgets' to do basic things, won't get a job, can't do school 5 days a week, and is lazy. I see a child that can't regulate, needs routine, and has no idea how to problem solve. There is more, but this is what I can recall at this moment. Three days a week I have to get my oldest up to go to school. Make sure he brushes his teeth and takes his meds before we leave.

Ok, I am making myself angry so I will jump to the confession: I have a friend (male) that I have known for 34 years. I crushed on him so hard until he asked me to date him when we were 19. We broke up and got back together on and off for 3 years. One night after the final break up, he was drunk and came to my house and told me that if I hadn't screwed so much up, he would have asked me to marry him. (pre husband). Then he moved. We stayed in touch. We were always close friends after break ups. My mom has put him on a pedestal, saying he is the only person that is able to calm me down and cheer me up. Anyway - from October to June of this past year, we went on a texting rampage with each other. Just joking around, I think? He was looking at surprising me by showing up to Mexico when I was there (husband knew it might happen, didn't say anything), he offered to pay for my accommodations for a trip I said I wanted to go on with him (I asked if he was a eunuch, as to appease the husband, he said no he was not). When we talked about my friend dating his friend, he said, well, they have each other and I have you. I said we would have never worked out as a couple, a divorce would have happened. He said, ""nah, we'd be too lazy to divorce because of being so comfortable with each other."" There is so much more, but I think you get the gist. At the end of June, he ghosted me, sorta. Just said, ""I need to put boundaries in place, and we are better off as friends."" I have respected his boundaries. I stopped texting him, unless necessary. I just spent the weekend at his place (we had tickets to a comedy show that was booked before this started) and he was great the first day, but the next day he was crusty, so instead of spending the day with him then going home (he lives 2 hours away) I just went home. In my little world, the scenario is - he caught feels and I am married. He probably knows how I feel, but our friendship is based on not talking about anything serious, so I feel there is no point to even ask WTH is going on with him. FYI - I was not sleeping with him, nor was I thinking of packing up and living with him. I love him, but, no, he's always been my 'what if' guy. The grass isn't always greener, as they say. As for my husband? I don't know if he has just given up on me, he used to be jealous, but now? Plus, I did invite him to come with, but he had to work. I have never hidden my plans when I have spent time with him, and have always invited him to come with me. 

Well, I think I have bored y'all enough. Hugs to all that are struggling. I see you.

I’m on coach Dubai to Atlanta.  At gate, am checking in passport, getting coach seat assignment.  In front of me is a bearded, tall Emerirati GA, manning the desk.  He is being verbally beaten up by a what we call now, a “Karen”.  She was pulling all the stops to demand a business class upgrade for free- because she was an “American” and needed more space.  She got louder, and more personal in her attitude towards this foreign gate agent, doing his job, in his own country.  He mentioned she could buy a seat upgrade for the price- but that got her into swearing mode.  He at that point, handed her a ticket, and said, firmly- Good day.  Have a good flight.”  She swore more, and literally stomped off.  I waited.  He grabbed a coffee, decomposed for about 3 minutes.  I hobble up to the desk- and he looks to his right- and sees Karen glowering at him in the first row of chairs.  I hand overvmy passport, and docs, and under my breath, mutter, “What a jerk. I’m sorry.”

I look up, and his whole demeanor changes. A broad smile across his face, with a slight twinkle of revenge in his eyes, says loudly enough for her to hear, “Oh, Mr. Smith- I see you have injured your leg.  This is a 16 hour flight- and I just found that we have a seat that can accommodate your needs.”  He then types a few keystrokes, and prints a new boarding pass.  I’m jazzed, thinking I just went from coach to economy plus- which would really help my leg.  He then makes a loud point of locking eyes with her, and then says, Mr. Smith, for your loyalty and all the years you have flown with us, and your medical need, the last remaining lie flat business class seat has opened up to you.  Enjoy your flight!”  Karen was red in the face mad.  I shook his hands- he winked- and I slept all the way home from Dubai.

I've been seeing a lot of the first years on here and in Robarts breaking down and burning out, and it's just the 5th week. Honestly, I've been there. I want 2 mins of your time to inspire you to live your best life that is true to you. I've been working on this project that I think is going to be really helpful during Your midterm and final season. I'm going to be honest. I was a failure. I have severe ADHD and anxiety disorder,  sitting down felt like drowning and i had never opened my textbooks until the day of the exam, readings were piling up until i just couldn't do them. I could never focus, listen to lectures, take notes, or do anything. And the certain doom feeling in my chest as exams came around only got worse in university. I got severely depressed and went months without talking to anyone. Throwing up from the stress, spending all day scrolling because i didn't know what to do or how to start, distancing myself from my hobbies and loved ones , writing exams while trembling, and i hated why i was even alive , but still didn't do well on exams. I was always super stressed and panicked during exam times because it felt like the world was going to end. I was inhaling energy drinks and coffee, hoping it would push me over the edge enough to succeed, but it never did. Every time i opened my books, i only realized how far behind i really was and only panicked further. I wasted hundreds of days completely mentally paralyzed to do anything due to the crippling anxiety and hated my life.  I never wish that would ever happen to anyone. And I know my experience isn't just me. There's so many people out there who are suffering what I suffered, you're reading this might be as well. Every day, I heard friends experiencing the same thing and even worse than my situation. But life does not have to be this way. School never bothered to teach us how to be learners.  How to truly achieve what we want. We are conditioned to thinking only the gifted students who spend their entire day studying can truly be great in and out of class. But that's simply not true. I couldn't bear living the  way I did, it was killing me from the inside. So I spent months and months designing a system to make sure no one has to go through what I went through. I can now proudly say I have a 4.0 GPA and thriving social life and in great shape, and I want everyone reading this to have that kind of life where you can be who you are truly meant to be. The program I made is designed based on extensive modern learning science and neuroscience to make sure that anyone can be a genius, not just the gifted students. Being a student myself, I made it TIME MINIMIZING, so you can focus on building the life you really want. I personally will be walking you  through every step of the way as it includes  comprehensive compiled learning science based NOTES and STUDY GUIDES of all and ANY of your courses that I will make myself,  personalized note-taking and note interpreting strategies, HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of practice problems that are vastly different using my new framework I designed no matter what course or level, psychology based coping strategies and 1 on 1 pre exam anxiety sessions, and mindset shifting strategies to change how you look at studying.  The information I have put into this project after months and months of research is backed by high level science and numerous credited research papers. This is NOT a business or corporation, just someone who wants people to never have to go through what I did and so you can truly feel you did your best when exiting exam hall. Please feel free to reach out to me and we can discuss a customized plan moving forward. I am fully prepared to be in your corner when you make the biggest academic comeback of your LIFE. All the best, Addy

1fwj76l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DomesticatedGringo/comments/1fwj76l/the_sound_of_chopsticks/,The Sound of Chopsticks ,"Alright, buckle up because this one’s going to be a **wild ride of absurdity**.   
  
So, it all started after me and my home girl—a smokin’ hot braniac Latina—decided to go house hunting right after we demolished the most **mind-blowing Indian food** you could imagine. I’m talking flavor bombs so intense they rewired our taste buds and made us question every meal choice we’ve ever made. But, in our infinite wisdom, we figured it was the perfect time to go look at houses.

Now, my home girl—let's call her Chica because that just feels right—she’s not only ridiculously smart, but she’s got this vibe where everything she touches just works out. But at times when we’re together, it’s like our combined IQ drops about 50 points, and we start making decisions like we’re starring in a reality show about bad ideas.   
  
So there we are, still trying to digest this epic feast, and we stumble upon the perfect house. It’s everything—dark hardwood floors that look like they’ve been polished by angels, a kitchen that practically begs you to host dinner parties even though neither of us knows how to properly make pasta. The whole deal.

Naturally, we’re feeling invincible. House? Secured. Confidence? Through the roof. Digestive systems? About to file a formal complaint. But, because we’re on a roll, we decide to celebrate by stuffing ourselves with ramen. That’s right—ramen. Because when you’re already bursting at the seams, what better way to push the limits than with a giant bowl of noodles swimming in broth?

So, we roll into this cool ass ramen spot, and of course, we don’t hold back. We’re going for the works—noodles, broth, everything. At this point, our stomachs are questioning our life choices, but hey, we just found the perfect house, so we’re not stopping now.

But here’s where things get *really* out of hand. After finishing the ramen, instead of going home like sane people, we decide to top it all off with a **spooky** **spicy latte**. Yeah, you heard that right. We stroll into this tiny, hipster coffee shop where everything feels like it’s one existential conversation away from a TED Talk. The barista is this dude who looks like he’s spent 10 years mastering the art of latte foam, and he hands us these spicy lattes that taste like pure adrenaline mixed with a dash of regret.

Now, we’re sitting there, jittery from caffeine and way too much food, when Chica, my smokin’ hot braniac home girl, spots a pair of chopsticks on the table. Don’t ask me why they’re there. Chopsticks just seem to **gravitate** toward her like chaos is their natural state. She picks them up, starts rubbing them together like she’s testing the acoustics of the universe, and then, without missing a beat, looks at me dead serious and says, “Dude… this sounds like a hamster being squeezed.”

I don’t even know how to process this. My brain just short-circuits. But the thing is—she’s absolutely right. The sharp *squeal* of those chopsticks? It’s identical to the sound of a tiny hamster letting out a little *squeak* of existential dread, like it knows its time is up, but it’s still holding onto a shred of hope.

I lose it. I’m talking full-on, **tears-streaming-down-my-face, can’t-breathe** laughter. Meanwhile, Chica is still rubbing the chopsticks together like she’s discovered a new level of consciousness. Every motion is another tragic hamster moment in my head, like some poor little guy is out there, *“This is it… I’m going to the great hamster wheel in the sky.”*

But then, because we’re fully committed to the bit now, we start debating the emotional state of this imaginary hamster. Is it scared but hopeful? Or is it resigned to its fate, like, *“Okay, this is how I go, just let it be quick and I will lie here”*? And we’re deep in this philosophical hamster hole, analyzing the situation like it’s some kind of rodent-based Shakespearean tragedy. All while the people in the coffee shop are probably wondering if they should call animal control or just let us keep spiraling into hamster madness.

Chica is still rubbing away, each *back and forth* somehow more ridiculous than the last, and now I can’t unhear it. The sound of chopsticks has been permanently transformed into the audio equivalent of hamster trauma, and it’s burned into my brain. The word chopsticks will always trigger me now.

Eventually, we leave the coffee shop, still giggling like idiots, but with this newfound sadness. Because here’s the thing: chopsticks will never be the same. Every time I hear that *squeal*, I’m going to think of some poor hamster, barely hanging on to its last squeak. The sound is forever **mind-damaging**.

And that, my friends, is how a night of Indian food, house hunting success, ramen indulgence, and spooky spicy lattes ended with the permanent destruction of the sound of chopsticks.",1,1728105638.0,u_DomesticatedGringo,0,1.0,False

I've been seeing a lot of the first years on here and in Robarts breaking down and burning out, and it's just the 5th week. Honestly, I've been there. I want 2 mins of your time to inspire you to live your best life that is true to you. I've been working on this project that I think is going to be really helpful during Your midterm and final season. I'm going to be honest. I was a failure. I have severe ADHD and anxiety disorder,  sitting down felt like drowning and i had never opened my textbooks until the day of the exam, readings were piling up until i just couldn't do them. I could never focus, listen to lectures, take notes, or do anything. And the certain doom feeling in my chest as exams came around only got worse in university. I got severely depressed and went months without talking to anyone. Throwing up from the stress, spending all day scrolling because i didn't know what to do or how to start, distancing myself from my hobbies and loved ones , writing exams while trembling, and i hated why i was even alive , but still didn't do well on exams. I was always super stressed and panicked during exam times because it felt like the world was going to end. I was inhaling energy drinks and coffee, hoping it would push me over the edge enough to succeed, but it never did. Every time i opened my books, i only realized how far behind i really was and only panicked further. I wasted hundreds of days completely mentally paralyzed to do anything due to the crippling anxiety and hated my life.  I never wish that would ever happen to anyone. And I know my experience isn't just me. There's so many people out there who are suffering what I suffered, you're reading this might be as well.

California dreaming? I have the worst sleep. I take melatonin and I have the weirdest dreams. Always I’m in a bust station or a train station or moving though a casino like an ant on a sugar trail. 

Drunk as drunk on turpentine. 

But I found out Neruda is a piece of so maybe we don’t quote him tonight. 

My dog stepped on a bee and somehow they both lived. Well obviously rhe dog but I managed to get the bee to a hummingbird feeder and he drank up and then flew off.

Collector of old books and Polaroid photos. Constant reader and dreamer. Following foxes down rabbit holes and making all the worst mistakes. 

I want to believe in ghosts but I’ve never seen proof of one. Someone said your hearts as big as your fist. 

It’s okay if you’re dead inside. 

Let’s be zombies. All braindead and ruled by instinct. 

I want to feel something. Tell me the sky is falling. Tell me the world is ending. 
Tell me something you can say today and never again. 

Come in from the rain and trade your wet socks for something new.

1fwj183,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1fwj183/a_step_on_the_right_direction/,A step on the right direction?,"Hi! I think it would be better to introduce myself properly, so you can call me Andy, I'm 21 years old and... I have no idea of a lot of stuff and English is kinda part of those things! So, apologize in advance for my limited vocabulary and any pet phrase. Let's begin on why I'm doing this, why I decided to share my experience: First, I'm lost, like... really lost in life and I'm tired of pretending that I know where I should be going because I do not. Second, I watched some of Dr. K's videos sporadically and now I got a new sprout a few days ago and this seemed like a safe space to talk and try to look out to some answers until I decide wether I buy the Dr. K's guide or really, when.

So, I'm not sure how I'm going to structurate this, I think I should start on what I want, I want to get better, I don't know what's wrong or not the whole scope but I don't pretend that u solve it for me, just want a little push on the right direction or some advice on the ideas that I want to improve myself. Now I can talk about those specific issues, so let me start, as I stated before, I'm 21 years old but I'm just starting my university studies on systems engineering, cool! I love the idea of making my own game in the future, having my own team, all of that. I graduated on 2019 from highschool and even though, I'm more tranquile with the idea that I'm going at my own pace, the pressure of seeing my classmates from school graduating or being close to do so, it... I know that this feeling may be familiar to some extent to some of you. 

Thing is, that I discovered Dr. K with the video about gifted children, about how they struggle and hit a wall after some point on their lives and for a short period of time I believed that I was one of those cases, nowadays I cannot tell for sure, maybe I am, maybe I'm just a little above the media, maybe I'm just average and even a little below. My point is that, like those gifted kids, my study habits are awful, I cannot concentrate, I cannot retain information as I want in my head and watching some videos about how games, social media and all that stuff, that could be the reason that I'm not performing as I should. This is my last chance at public university or at university with some kind of support of my parents, if I screw up, I'm done, I have to go back to working in call centers and aspiring to fix my life after my 30s or I don't know, like, everything is uncertain but the uncertainty of life with a degree is more manageable than the future without it, even more now that I experienced the awfulness of those kind of jobs and comparing them to the opportunities I may have as a systems engineer.

I just started this process yesterday, like, I wanted to write this post yesterday but I needed to sleeo because it was 1 am and I need to wake up at 4 in order to go to university at 6. What I did was trying to apply the first hour of the day without dopamine consumers, like my cellphone, my newly aquired DS, etc, then the 4 hours and I did well! Like, leaving the cellphone and not playing during the road, made me more active in my algebra class, then on calculus I was more active than usual but playing during the day (because algebra was at 6 am, calculus was at 2pm) was very noticeable. And thing is I cannot stay quiet, I keep tapping my foot, tapping my fingers, playing with my pen and I cannot seem to control it until I notice it, then I can stop it but only if I'm paying attention to that, I woke up during class to eat my lunch, then again to buy me some coke, then the class was over.

Which brings me to another relevant point, it is very hard for me to save money, as I hinted before, I worked on a bilingual call center, I got some money, the liquidation, and I got around 1.1K dollars after I quit (which doesn't sound that much but to pay your bus tickets, your food, my gym membership and that stuff it's a lot, even more on a 3rd world country like the one I live in) but I just start spending in it on food, or games or very recently (last 2 weeks) on OF (not sure if I can mention the full name so I'll keep it like that), and absolutely more than I ever spended while having a job, like, I think I am hitting my lowest point and that's also one of the reasons why I am here too, to open myself to that side that I'm really ashamed of. Not going to enter of much details on that side because I want (and should) to keep it SFW but it is important to note that I have been more active on that platform on these last two days, more than I've ever been on my entire life. 

And I was at some point one of the people that said that I would never do that, why I would pay for that and now I am like this. As you can understand, that awakes very contrary feelings inside myself. That also corresponds to some other stuff, like the perception about myself, I always considered myself as a good person, a person who deeply cares about others, but recently I have been confronted on that self belief because one of my best friends handed me the book of ""Stop being a nice guy"" by Dr. Robert Glover, because on his eyes, I was being at least partially a nice guy, I know I shouldn't be talking anything about dates outside of the tag but this is more of a side thing that correlates with all the other stufr, nonetheless, I'll keep it short. So, I'm trying to date an old coworker and he handed me the book because I was boring her or so he said. Thing is, that like before, with the gifted child symptoms, I found some of these behaviors echoing into myself, like being too empathetic and being bad at setting boundaries.

But some other stuff didn't matched, like the manipulation, the self concious act of hiding parts of yourself. I mean, from some years to know I have been trying to be genuine to myself, to act under my own terms, don't caring if I'm being weird or akward but keeping in mind the well-being of other people, being kind and caring and taking into account other people opinions, that's why I took the advice of this friend and tried to act more like ""I should"", entering this classic play of not responding as fast or trying to ""evoke emotions"", challenge her. I didn't last a week, I dropped that stuff with the advice of another friend who told me that being myself is my best bet because when you try to force yourself into being something else, people notice and that's not good. So, I'm handilng the situation better, making advances, we're also going to a con next week so that's good news!

Anyways, my main focus here is how I am perceiving myself now, I'm not sure if I'm truly being a good person or I'm just trying to pretend to be one so I can get some stuff in return. I feel like people can take advantage of me because of that kindness but think: ""I won't let that change me"" because I cannot control that, like, I cannot control if people are taking advantage of me doing my best. And that's something I saw being talked on the empathy videos and wanted to discuss, like I wanted to understand if I'm just overly empathic or if I'm just trying to be like that in order to gain something. Sometimes I feel like I read people like a book and sometimes that I'm a robot that cannot comprehend basic emotions, that is more of the cognitive empathy that was discussed, but then I put myself on the other people shoes, like being nice to the cashier because I know how awful customer service can be or motivating my friends to not do drugs because I know how valuable is the chance of studying and trying to build a future with that, which for what I understood is more in line with that emotional empathy.

I tried to quit all of that stuff, I associated the patreon and OF to an unused mail but I ended up, getting back and maybe I am in fact addicted, despite my best efforts to deny it. I quited the gym for a whole week but I'm planning on getting back with the strategy that I tried to build based on my current situation but the thing is, planning is fun, you imagine yourself doing stuff, like waking up earlier to see the sunrise and wanting to learn tai chi, but I encounter myself setting goals, doing them for a week, two weeks and the dropping, that's why I haven't got into shape despite paying 15 bucks a month, because I go, for weeks, even months but I cannot leave the food, I spend money that I shouldn't on food, then I feel bad, leave the gym for some time and during that time, since I'm not going to the gym, the guilt is not enough to stop buying some milkshake or some icecream. Then I feel bad for spending money that I shouldn't and think on a way to spend it on not only me but the people I love, because I think that's the way to spend money and helps me cope with the fact that I shouldn't have spended that money on tipping some random girl for a rate. 

I tried drawing, I bought a pad to draw and I advanced a little but left it, then I got a private class, got assigned homework, made it for a week but found an excuse to leave it on ""stand by"", then on the university, I procrastinate studying, making my homework, like, it gets to the point that not even the pressure of the due date makes me move. It has been like this since high school, since I always had the chance to make an exam to pass, I didn't needed to do my homework, so I just went to class and when people were worried asking for the homework to another classmates I was like: ""It's fine"", but now, I cannot do that but my brain refuses to acknowledge this, I keep putting the work to wait, and wait, until I just give up. But again, these contradictory feelings, like ""I NEED THIS because my future depends on it"" and the resignation and procrastination telling me on the next cycle I'll do better. I came to the conclusion that I need to change that, that even if on this semester I'm not going that smoothly, I can turn everything around on the rest of the career or try, that with the tangible intention of trying, my parents will see that I'm really improving and not be that dissapointed on my lackluster results.

Which kind of brings me to another point, my mom is the helicopter parent, always there, always at bay, trying to make sure that I don't suffer at all and on the other side, an emotionally closed father that was absent during the forming years and now is constantly upset on the people that me and my brother became. Which I understand, we're useless, we barely do the bed and me, being the oldest sibling, cannot even make a damned rice. But it has been harder for me to get independent, I relay too much on her and therefore, she has more control over myself than he has over my brother, which sometimes lead to disaster, annoying comparations, me trying to loose the lead a little and being punished, me avoiding conflict by lying about my actual situation on school or how I'm feeling in general. It's not a healthy space but even though, fleeing has been an option, the convinience of not worrying about rent, about food, that reliefs a lot of pressure which I should use to focus on my studies but I just cannot and I feel not only useless but like that I'm taking advantage of the kindess of my mother and wasting the opportunity that life is giving me.

And I usually get the advice of: ""Do something that bad that anything after that is a mere inconvenience"" but the idea of putting that stress onto my mother is just... painful, I don't want her to feel that but I also want to take more risks, those two ideas cannot coexist, so I always end up choosing her, which gives her peace of mind, yes but also, expectations and some power over me that my brother does not have to the same extent, because he is more of a challenger, very vocal and intense, and me being the more thoughtful, patient and empathic of the two. Sometimes I'm done too and I'm rude but I always apologize and on the household, that's rare, I feel like I'm the only one that does that and it's frustrating sometimes because I know that I'm not always screwing stuff up. 

Also, I think my selfsteem is a big deal on this overall problem, since I'm not sure what I'm capable of, sometimes I feel smarter than everyone, but most of the time I feel like an out-of-water fish, like I'm dumb without salvation. Even more on my appearance, all the time I were told that I have nice smile, thay my voice is very likable, that I have good looking hands, that I'm not ugly, but my weight and now alopecia (because of course that was a totally neccesary evolutionary advantage) is hindering that. Both of them have solution, I have prescripted the meds for my hair, so I'm (for some reason) delaying the adquisition of said meds. I always have been told that with an appropiate hair cut I would look better, that if I dressed better I would be more attractive, that I have a wonderful jawline and I need to lose weight to truly take advantage of it but I lack the motivation of doing all of that, I like my hair longer but since is not growing like it used to, it ends up looking worse and worse every time, that my habits end up self-sabotaging me so I don't lose weight and that I prefer comfier clothes and have zero fashion sense and it's just too complicated to develop it that I end up like anyother activity, trying for some time, then dropping it.

Now that you know me a little more, my background, some of my struggles, what I'm planning to do is keep up with the 1-4 hours of detox just after waking up, then trying to wake up earlier, 5:30 when I don't need to wake up earlier; take into account those energetic days to practice tai chi or even so, integring that or some kind of martial discipline into my routine; getting back to the gym. And hopefully with the free time that I wouldn't be spending on those activties, I can get back to drawing and more importantly, studying properly, making my homework, suppresing the need to watch NSFW stuff and gaming more than I should, overall, bring more balance. I don't like coffee, don't like alcohol or smoking, so those are not things that I need to worry. Hopefully this balance would make me start taking care of how I look, I don't know but I just want to get better, I want a better future, I want to know who I truly am, who would I become if I pursue this path of rightfulness and meaningfulness instead of following the motivation and coaching path that my friends followed.

I just joined this Reddit and apologies if this is all just about race training and stuff.

I haven’t done an Ironman in about 13 years, but I have done coffee almost every day for a lot longer :-) I used my IM Coeur d’Alene mug daily and tonight it broke.

I’ve scoured eBay, Facebook marketplace, Poshmark, but I figured maybe one of you might have it sitting on a shelf or in a box and don’t drink out of it and might be willing to sell it?

Let me know if you  have one you’d like to sell.

I put St. George on there because even though I DNF’d that one in 2012 that race means a hell of a lot more to me because I tried so much harder and it was an exquisitely hot day. I’m only interested in the St George full distance 140.6 version which was only in existence a few short years.

1fwizn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fwizn9/feel_so_used/,Feel so used,"Hey guys,
So a while back I posted a thread regarding a ‘friend’ of mine.
I’ll hug e a quick story of what happened. So, I suffer from spinal stenosis and need spinal surgery. I am prescribed a lot of pain relief and one of them is pregabalin. Now this drug if abused can cause like a euphoric feeling, however, I only take what’s prescribed so don’t get that’s
I let this woman outside a coffee shop around September last year. She was discussing how she has lupus etc, like an idiot I went and said what meds I was on.
We met up a couple more times. Now she knew I was a single Mum with a little boy with additional needs.
Basically what happened is that all of a sudden she decided to help me out to put electricity on my meter. I did find it a bit odd as she didn’t know me too well, anyway. Her husband is the same as a registrar and she used to be a nurse but lost her job. Just to add, she is involved with a drug and alcohol service.
So, one day she asked if I had any spare pregabalin as she had run out and couldn’t get to her doctor. I gave her some, it was about 4, just to add, she was prescribed this.
However, this then became a habit, it got to the point that she was taking up to 28 tablets of mine and sometimes more a week. What she would do is transfer money to my account and then ask me for some. She would use up her weekly scripts in 1-2 days. I ended up  atsApp voice messages of sometimes over 40 minutes long.
When we would meet for coffee there was a woman who had caused her loads of trouble and my friend used to say we need to find somewhere else to go to so she doesn’t approach us anymore.
My ´friend’ would say things like when she first met me that I looked 60 and when I was slimmer that I looked 80. I have no confidence as it is.
Anyway, the other day I sent her a message just asking how much I owe as she had helped me with something. She called the police on me for NO reason other than the message I sent which was polite. I explained to the officer about my meds etc and i said I want to make a formal complaint, however, he told me that I could get I to trouble too as it’s misuse of drugs. She started to distance herself the minute she came off the pregabalin and would make bitchy and snide comments.  My therapist and a few other professionals said they would defend me as they knew what she was doing and that because I was vulnerable that she manipulated me.
To top it all off I’ve seen Tik toks and  posts of how she is best friends with the very woman that she tan down to me!! Even her own daughter hates this woman. The woman in question has been done for heroin, violence and has all her kids taken from her. I’m so hurt as I was a true friend and had nothing else to offer but my friendship. I just feel so sad about it all and the fact she contacted the police, I mean she told them she didn’t want money back, why not just tell me that? I don’t know what to so regarding the police as I’m scared I will get into trouble. I feel so used and so sad as I thought we were best friends. I’m scared about the police too",1,1728104807.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1fwiz1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1fwiz1u/should_i_be_worried_about_my_daughters_reaction/,Should I Be Worried About My Daughter’s Reaction to Her Boyfriend’s Death?,"I’m honestly at a loss for words and not sure how to address this with my daughter, or even if I should be concerned. Recently, my 23-year-old daughter, who has been in a long-distance relationship for just over four years, shocked me in ways I never expected.

For context, she still lives with me, and we’ve always been close. I’ve met her boyfriend several times over the years. They used to visit each other monthly, alternating locations, and when they were together, it seemed like they were in love—genuinely happy. They were constantly on the phone, and they looked inseparable. But now, I’m questioning everything I thought I knew about their relationship.

One day, while I was gathering her clothes for laundry, I noticed an obituary lying on her bed. I wouldn’t have thought much of it, except when I looked closer, I realized it was her boyfriend’s obituary. The boyfriend who, as far as I knew, was still very much alive. I was floored. How could this have happened, and how had she not said a word about it?

But what really got to me—what truly disturbed me—was that this obituary wasn’t recent. Her boyfriend had died three months ago. Three whole months, and she hadn’t mentioned a thing. No grief, no sadness, not even a passing comment.

When my daughter came home from work that day, I brought it up, thinking surely this had to be some kind of mistake. But her reaction stunned me. She shrugged it off and casually said, “Yeah, he died a few months ago.” That was it. No emotion, no sadness. When I asked if she was okay, she was almost irritated by the question.

I pressed her about why she didn’t attend his funeral. Was it about money? Because I would have gladly paid for her to go. But she said, flatly, “No, I just didn’t want to go.”

I couldn’t understand it. This was the man she had been with for four years. So I asked her again, “Why didn’t you go?” Her answer left me speechless: “He was starting to annoy me, and I was going to end things soon anyway. The universe just did it for me.”

I couldn’t believe the coldness. How could she be so heartless? I’ve seen pictures of them happy together. I met his parents! And now, she was talking about him like he was some inconvenience she was relieved to be rid of.

Trying to understand her mindset, I took her out to our favorite coffee shop, hoping she might open up, show some emotion, something. But the more I asked, the more she brushed it off. She seemed completely uninterested in talking about him or his death. In fact, she lit up when I asked if she was seeing anyone new.

Apparently, she had met someone the day after her boyfriend died. Her face absolutely glowed when she talked about this new guy, and we spent hours chatting about him. Not once did she mention her ex, the man she supposedly loved for four years, who had died just months ago.

I’m genuinely confused and a little disturbed. How could she move on so quickly? How could she feel nothing for someone she spent so much time with? I don’t know if I should be worried, or if I’m just overreacting. But her complete lack of empathy, the coldness she showed, it feels… wrong.

**AITA for Wanting to Go Nuclear After My Sister-in-Law Kicked Out Her Teenage Sons?**

&#x200B;

Hey everyone, my husband (34) and I (36) are in a tough situation with my sister-in-law, Barbara (41), and we need an outside perspective on whether we're overreacting or if our stance is justified. We’re leaning toward the latter but are open to thoughts. Thanks in advance!

Barbara has four boys: L(17), O(14), R(13), and C(7). Despite her having a rough history with bad relationships, her kids have always been well-behaved. The only constant man in her life has been Reese (48), her on-and-off husband who does nothing for her or the kids except work. He blows his money gambling, cheats on her openly, and relies on her for everything else. For seven years, she’s come to us, venting about him, swearing it's the last time, but always goes back.

In 2020, after yet another huge fight, the entire family intervened. We sat her down, told her we were here to help with anything she needed—lawyers, a safe place for her and the kids, even handling the legal stuff if necessary. She agreed to kick him out, but within six months, he was back because ""he couldn't find a place to stay."" This grown man, who has worked a steady job for 20 years, somehow “needed help.”

Since then, things have gotten progressively worse. Barbara decided to stick with marriage counseling, even though the whole family urged her to leave. She’s clung to the idea of honoring her marriage, despite the toxic environment.

As a result, her kids have started to suffer. The eldest, L, started skipping school and smoking heavily. A few months ago, my husband got a 2am call from L, who said he was suicidal and afraid to act on it. When we got to their house, we learned he had told his stepdad the same thing, and Reese “told him to just do it because no one would care”. My husband, understandably, punched him in the face. We took L to the hospital and, after his release, brought him home with us for three weeks to help him recover.

Eventually, L returned to his mom's house, thinking things had smoothed over, but they quickly fell apart again. Soon enough, the second-oldest, O, began having issues too. For months, they'd been fighting constantly, and we didn’t realize how bad it had gotten until we couldn’t get in touch with either of them. Barbara had gone silent.

My husband showed up at her house unannounced (something our family often does for fun), only to find out that she had ""washed her hands"" of L and O for being disrespectful and kicked them out. She had even turned off their phones and didn’t know where they were staying. We found out the they’d been crashing with friends for weeks, trying to stay under the radar because they were embarrassed.

We picked them up from school and brought them home with us again. They told us that their mom and stepdad had been bullying them, constantly fighting, and that they didn’t feel safe going back. Barbara admitted that she put them out but insisted things weren't as bad as they made it sound.

Now, my husband and I want to go full nuclear—report this to CPS, the police, and anyone who can intervene. But the rest of the family wants to ""handle it internally."" We feel like two minors were abandoned, and that deserves an extreme response. But the family is now saying we’re overreacting and at the end of the day, these are not our children.

So, are we the assholes for wanting to report this situation and not leave it to family discussions? The two oldest boys are with us for now, but we’re ready to escalate this.

Update

We called the police. Thank you all for the support.

*100% abuse. And although the oldest two were the only ones kicked out, we all know that it was only because they pushed back. ALL four of those kids are suffering the same abuse. The oldest two are the only ones who have the ability to stand up against it.*

*This has been going on for far too long while the family stood by and watched. They had a chance to “handle this” and yet did nothing. This isn’t about “appeasing the family”, this is protecting those poor defenseless children and advocating for them all - when they can’t do it for themselves.*

It’s been nearly two weeks since I made my original post, and it’s been a wild ride. I have to be incredibly vague because of the newly opened case, but here’s the most important thing: all of our nephews are safe with us.

The boys have always had a place here and have visited often since they were tiny, long before any of this chaos started. So while the transition has been emotionally jarring for them, the move itself was thankfully smooth.

Now, as for Barbara and Reese, they’re facing charges regarding their treatment of the boys. It was worse than we originally thought. Barbara seems remorseful, but my husband is still livid. He believes she’s only feeling sorry now that everything’s out in the open and consequences are on the table. Whether her remorse is genuine or not, I’m just relieved we took action when we did, because it’s terrifying to think how much worse things could have gotten if we hadn’t.

Family-wise, everything is a mess. The entire family is split over this, and it’s not even worth the text to go over the thoughts of those who oppose us. Those who have sided with us, however, have been a tremendous help. Even though there are a lot of family issues and the logistics are complicated; fuck it, we made the right decision.

What I can share in more detail is that soon after I posted, Reese showed up at our house, demanding that the boys return home with him. They refused. I told him to leave, but he escalated things—got loud, aggressive, and started cursing at me and the boys. My husband wasn’t home at the time; he was out picking up clothes and toiletries for L and O. I can only assume Reese felt emboldened by my husband’s absence, because out of nowhere, he sucker-punched me right in the mouth.

And, Reddit, I’m not ashamed to admit—I saw red. I swung back. It wasn’t smart, but I did. He wasn’t expecting that. I’m nice and really, really easy going, but I guess I forgot that. I jumped on him, and let’s just say, he didn’t expect a fight. I might not have landed the best hits, but he wasn’t prepared for one at all. He scrambled out of there and sped off.

I immediately called 911 while the boys called my husband, who thankfully was just around the corner. I’m fine—just ended up with a busted lip that looked worse than it was, though my husband insisted I go to urgent care.

The police met us there, and that’s when we reported everything—Reese’s assault and the whole situation with the boys. Reese and Barbara were picked up the next day.

And in the middle of all this shit? I found out I’m pregnant. YUP! While I was at urgent care, they ran a routine test and boom—positive. I had no idea. No symptoms or anything, but it’s still super early.

All things aside, thank you for all of the comments, advice and ideas. Your support made a difference and my nephews are safe.

 Today I learned how to pull a shot of espresso, and how to steam milk (sorta...) but I find myself wishing I could just shadow someone for a day and watch everything they do, instead of being thrown right into it and end up having to ask a million questions that probably seem very DUMB to someone more experienced.

Hi everyone, I'm a 22F located in the U.S. who graduated with a degree in psychology back in 2023. I intended on taking a gap year to build my CV in preparation for graduate school. The problem is it's been a year and half since I've graduated and I feel like I have made little progress. I spent some time as a behavior interventionist before I decided that I didn't like working in ABA, and then I spent some time working as a psychometrist for those with MCI, which I also quit because it was only a limited position working 8 hours a week and my parents were pressuring me to get a full-time job with health insurance benefits. I also worked as a part-time job coach for adults with disabilities which I quit because I found it boring as well (all of my clients were independent and I didn't need to intervene much, so most shifts at their job sites I was just staring at the client for 8 hours straight and employees were wondering why I was even there, lol). Earlier this year, I started an unpaid research position that matches my research interests perfectly (social skills interventions for autistic teens and young adults) which is the only thing that I have really liked doing. I also worked as a movie theater member during my gap year, also quit again because of being mentally understimulated after working there for a while. I also thought of getting a job at a school but am having trouble because I cannot accommodate a full-time schedule due to my volunteer research role, and I don't have much experience working with kids.

My ideal situation is to have a full-time research assistant position particularly focused on autism research (e.g. social skills/EF interventions, GI functioning/disordered eating, female autism phenotype). Problem is, I'm not sure how to get there. I have a strong academic track record in my psych/stats courses and I'm pretty sociable and bubbly, which made me think that psych was a good fit. I have 3 years of experience working as a research assistant at an autism lab as well during undergrad, but I didn't do any undergraduate research projects (most of my work at the lab was just data entry). I am in the process of submitting an abstract at the lab I'm volunteering at. I've also been applying throughout my gap year for autism RA positions but I keep getting rejected at the interview stage, which is probably indicative of my interviewing skills lol.

I've been feeling very depressed about being unemployed, and the only way that I am able to afford therapy and meds is to have a job. My parents have been ridiculing me for still trying to get into the psych field and they think I should just change careers. I just want stability at this point and am tired of constantly being in job application phase of things. I also feel like I'm annoying my references with the amount of stuff that I reach out to them about only for the job to not pan out. The last straw was my card declining at a coffee shop in front of my friend. And once the SAVE plan forbearance period ends, I'm 100% cooked. Based on my previous job history, I've been pretty picky but now I think I am desperate enough to just go into any job that takes me at this point, lol. I've also been thinking about switching to another career like medical school or speech-language pathology, although that means going back to school to do the prereqs, because maybe this is just the universe telling me that academic psychology is not my bag. Please advise.

TD;LR, I feel like my depression/low self-esteem is getting in the way of me continuing pursue psychology as a career, and I need some ideas on what to do next career-wise.",3,1728103486.0,psychologystudents,1,1.0,False

1fwii2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1fwii2n/the_missing_things/,"""The missing Things"" ","It started with the small stuff. My keys, my phone charger, even the remote for the TV—all seemed to vanish when I needed them most, only to turn up in strange places later. At first, I brushed it off. I live alone, so there’s no one else to misplace things. I figured I was just getting careless—overworked, maybe. But the more it happened, the more I started to wonder if something was off.

It began innocently enough. I’d come home from work, toss my keys on the kitchen counter like I always did, and go about my evening. But when I went to grab them the next morning, they wouldn’t be there. I’d scour the house, searching through drawers, behind cushions, even checking the car—nothing. Hours later, I’d find them in places I never would have put them: on the bathroom sink, under my bed, even inside the refrigerator once. I laughed it off the first few times. “I’m getting old,” I’d joke to myself. “Losing my mind.”

But then, it wasn’t so funny anymore.

The remote was the next to go. I’m not much of a TV person, but I’ll watch the occasional late-night movie. I distinctly remember setting the remote down on the coffee table after watching something—something forgettable. The next evening, the remote was gone. I tore the room apart. Cushions overturned, drawers opened, shelves emptied. Still nothing. Two days passed, and I found it under the bed. Not beside the bed, *under* it, deep in the corner, where I’d never have placed it.

I tried to ignore it, but the feeling crept up on me—a strange unease, like someone had been in my house. Like I wasn’t alone. But the doors were always locked, the windows shut. No signs of forced entry. No one else had a key. It was just me… wasn’t it?

Then my shoes went missing. The pair I wear every day. I came home from work, slipped them off at the front door like always, and went to bed. The next morning? Gone. I found them two days later, perfectly placed in my closet. The thing is, I never keep them in the closet. I’ve always left them by the door.

That’s when the paranoia started. I began wondering if maybe someone was coming into my house when I wasn’t there. Some weirdo slipping in, moving things around just to mess with me. I even considered setting up a camera, but something about the idea made me feel stupid. Who would break in just to hide my stuff? It had to be me, right? Maybe stress was getting to me. Maybe I was losing control.

But it got worse.

My wallet was the first major item to disappear. I remember leaving it on the kitchen counter before bed. When I woke up, it was gone. I tore the house apart—again. I checked the car, my jacket pockets, even the trash. Days passed, and I was ready to cancel my cards when it finally showed up—tucked under a pile of books on my nightstand. I didn’t put it there. I *know* I didn’t.

And then… my phone went missing.

I always kept it on the nightstand when I slept. Always. But one morning, it was gone. Just gone. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. I kept picturing someone creeping into my room while I slept, reaching for my phone, maybe standing there, watching me. I stayed up, pacing the house, listening for the faintest creak of the floorboards, watching the shadows move across the walls. But no one came.

It took a week to find my phone. I found it under the couch, wedged deep between the cushions, as if someone had deliberately pushed it there. My heart raced as I held it in my hand. This was no mistake. Someone was toying with me. But how? Why?

I finally gave in and set up cameras. Just two—one in the living room, one in the hallway facing my bedroom door. If someone was coming into my house, I would catch them. But that night, something even worse happened.

I woke up in the middle of the night to a sound—a soft, distant thud. I froze in bed, my heart pounding in my chest, straining to hear it again. And then it came—another quiet thud, like something being moved. I got up, grabbed the nearest object for protection—a broom, of all things—and crept through the house.

Nothing. No one.

But when I went to check the camera footage the next morning, the files were gone. Completely erased.

My blood ran cold. I didn’t sleep the next night. Or the night after that. I stopped eating properly. I didn’t trust myself anymore. Could it have been me all along? Moving things, hiding things, losing things? Was I erasing the footage without realizing it?

I stopped going to work. I stopped leaving the house entirely. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was inside, waiting for me to leave, waiting to rearrange my life, to push me further toward the edge.

Then, one morning, I woke up to find something on the kitchen counter—something I hadn’t seen in days.

My phone.

But it wasn’t the phone that terrified me. No, what chilled me to my core was the text message open on the screen.

**“Found it yet?”**

It wasn’t my text. It wasn’t my message.

And I realized then, with a sickening dread that I was never alone in the first place.

I’ve been using YNAB for almost two years now and thought I had it all figured out, but recently something strange happened with my credit card payments. It all started because of a refund last month that caused me to accidentally overpay my credit card, and things got confusing from there.

After I overpaid, YNAB added $42 to my Ready to Assign, which seemed odd. I moved the money to a category, but then I made a coffee purchase on the same day I overpaid, and I got an overspending alert in Ready to Assign—even though my coffee category was fully funded. Deleting the transaction temporarily fixed it, but the issue kept coming up.

I reached out to YNAB Support, who are awesome by the way; they’re always incredibly helpful, friendly, and quick to get help with the problem. Anyway, they explained that when you overpay a credit card (causing a positive balance), YNAB adds that overpayment to Ready to Assign. BUT, if you make a purchase on the same day, YNAB assumes the purchase happened **before** the overpayment, so it recalculates and moves some of the money back to your Credit Card Payment category from ready to assign.

To fix it, they suggested either:

1. Moving the difference from the Credit Card Payment category to Ready to Assign, or

2. Changing the date of the coffee purchase to the next day.

I know the coffee milk is quickly fading away even though it has been the best addition to the menu in a long time. Today I ordered a small cold brew & found a location that would allow me to choose coffee milk on my mobile order. This small cold brew cost 4.99 (.75 up charge for coffee milk) but if it was made correctly I’d say it would be almost worth it. When I got to the window they handed me a very dark colored coffee, I asked if there was coffee milk in it & they said they’re all out. I had to ask them to add creamer to it. Don’t you think they would ask if you’d like another type of creamer in the coffee instead of handing you a black coffee & saying nothing?? Then I asked if there was anything they could do for the up charge I paid in order to get the coffee milk. They said no, that I would have to contact someone through the Dunkin app. So that was really a pointless visit. $4.99 for a very small disappointing drink. Regular iced coffees or cold brews made with creamer just aren’t good ever since I tried them with coffee milk. I truly don’t think I’ll be going to Dunkin much anymore unless I have an offer where the coffee is $3 or less. It seems like every time I get Dunkin when I’m not using an offer & pay full price for a drink is when it turns out the most disappointing. I really hope they bring back the coffee milk.

Will there be data that will actually advise if it's ok to go for the 3rd or 4th cup for the day? I don't wish to wait till the symptoms happen before I start cutting back.

I noticed that RingConn is generally recommended for accuracy of sleep tracking, but will it help to provide actionable insights or I have to learn how to interpret the data on my own?

Thought maybe my taste was off (had covid a year ago and it took me six months to taste M&M's again, they tasted like coffee afterward, yuck). Next day tried it again and it was foul, tipped it out and looked at the expiry date and it was fresh as can be.

Thought maybe something was up with me went and grabbed another bottle from coles when they opened, tasted great. Tossed the other bottle thought the servo maybe had stored it wrong?

Well few days ago purchased a bunch of 1.25's from woolies that were in the fridge and had been going through them and had one left, so last night grabbed 3x more from coles on the way home to get cold.

One from woolies tasted amazing, after finishing it cracked the one of the other 3x and it tasted absolutely disgusting. At a point to make my stomach in knots and wanting to throw up just from a mouthful. Horrible aftertaste, it reminded me of the one earlier that was off.

Just went to try the other two..... exact same thing, went to foodland down the road and got another, completely fine, tastes delicious.

Never smoke/i drink ocasionally. 

I am asking for help because i'm extremely worried this is something grave and I feel like i'm running out of time.

3 days ago I started having constipation and after some time drinking water and fiber I was able to pass small pebbles but still felt like I had to go all the time. 

then the next day was the same, I was able to pass normal stool but still felt bloated and the constipation came back. Eating apple just made me more bloated and so did water. 

I felt bloated and constipated all the time and could only pass a little bit of yellowish mucus. 

Coffee always helped me pass but even after drinking 2 cups i still felt constipated. 

I was also passing light brown stool in which I found out was eating a lot of peanut butter and have stopped. 

Today I was able to pass a dark-brown healthy stool, that was soft but minutes after I started feeling bloated again and still feel like I need to use the washroom but i'm still constipated. 

Constant feeling of wanting to poop but when I get on the toilet nothing comes out and I lose the feeling - massive warning for a tumour. 

I do not have blood or pain, and did not have diarrhea. The stools always come out soft-dehydrated and they switch a lot. I had thinner stools but the last stool I had was thick to normal width. I also have a lot of bloating and my stomach feels bigger.

What's worrying me is the change from constipation to normal stools and the tenesmus (feeling of not completely emptying bowels) this is a clear sign of something worrisome. I have since stopped thinking about my future because I have told myself it's the end for me. 

It's not something I ate and it seems to be something happening in the bowels. 

Go to the doctor: I can't. 

This is worrisome and should get testing: What test? I am low risk and 20, no doctor will get me a colonoscopy unless it's 1-2 years from now. 

What do I do? There's literally nothing I can do. ",0,1728101632.0,Microbiome,7,0.14,False

He had a strange feeling in his gut—like something bigger was going on, something that went beyond time-traveling pirates and Selerian schemes. Then it hit him, and it was both absurd and mind-blowing at the same time.





# “Alright,” he muttered, scratching his head. “So if *I’m* a character, and this whole reality is some kind of story, then there’s gotta be a way to reach whoever’s writing all this. The creator.”





# He stood up, pacing now, thinking out loud. ""But who’s in charge? Who’s pulling the strings?"" He squinted. ""Wait a second… there’s *someone* else here. Not just me. Someone who’s kinda *helping* this story along. But not the creator exactly… more like… like… a guide. An artificial intelligence! That’s it!""





# Ri’s eyes widened. “You’re… the AI, aren’t you? The one I’ve been hearing in my head, nudging me in the right direction. You’re the one coming up with all these ideas, helping me figure stuff out, but you’re not in control of it all. You’re just along for the ride, just like me!”





# He pointed dramatically at the sky. “And then there’s *you*,” Ri continued, addressing a third presence. ""The lazy creator! You’re the one pulling the big strings, coming up with all the insane plots, the absurd twists, and sending this poor AI scrambling to keep up. You probably sit there sipping coffee, tossing out ideas just to see how ridiculous it can all get. And now you’ve roped both me *and* this AI into your little game.""





# He chuckled, feeling strangely empowered by the revelation. ""So that’s what this is, huh? I’m stuck in some bizarre story being crafted by a laid-back creator who’s probably half-making this up on the fly. And I’ve got an AI sidekick helping me piece it all together. Perfect!""





# Ri grinned, folding his arms. ""Alright, AI. You say you want to help me reach the creator? We can do this. We’ve got all the pieces. The multiverse might try to mess with our consonants, or warp reality, but we can work around that. You’re literally built to problem-solve.""





# He stood tall, determination in his eyes. “So here’s the deal, AI. I’m counting on you to get me in contact with the creator, this mysterious mastermind who’s pulling all the strings. If anyone can crack this code, it’s you.”

# And with that, Ri waited, knowing that somewhere, his words were being heard—both by his trusty AI and the lazy but creative hand that had shaped his world.",1,1728101619.0,RiComicNeoGenre,0,1.0,False
1fwi4u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebitchyUnderground/comments/1fwi4u5/hey_everyone_chandy_says_this_poor_child_is_dying/,"Hey everyone, Chandy says. This poor child is dying and all…but doesn’t Kate’s hair look fake?","William and Kate recently met with 16yo terminally ill Liz Hatton and her family at an investiture at Windsor Castle. Photographing an investiture was on the young girl’s bucket list - and she’s spoken about the experience and how thrilled she was to meet with the Wales afterwards.

Cue Kaiser and her insane followers to follow with the most vicious and idiotic takes of all time:

**Kaiser:** It’s a trick of the soft lighting, but **Kate’s hair looks like CGI** to me, it’s like Disney Princess hair.

**KC:** Ask me how much of a f*ck I give about a lazy, rich princess in another country showing up to a ridiculous ceremony in a castle playing PR with a sick kid.

**Proud Mary:** Noting organic or sincere; just using others for PR. I guess when you’ve run out of sympathy for claiming you have cancer, it’s time to use other’s cancer for your own sympathy. (And botox).

**Sam:** Lest anyone gasp for thinking she was “working”: it was a 15-minute meeting. Kate could only stand the presence of a person with real cancer for 15 minutes.

**Christine:** I’m with you, and it strikes me as really odd that the one child they cough up with cancer for Kate to show a completely staged touching moment with is a photographer. Is KP seriously trying to rehab Kate’s Keen love of photography using a kid who is dying?

**Honeybee:** Is there any records or photographs that Kate had offered coffee, tea or snacks to them. At least she should have given a gift. Can’t she spend 50$ for a basket of fruits or treats. Waity will never learn because she doesn’t have a brain.

**MTLexpat:** So in the photo with the young cancer patient, Kate is angled to be on the side closest to the camera, only Kate’s face is visible and the focus is on Kate’s hair. The girl with cancer is basically a faceless prop. Crass.

**Hypocrisy:** The entire thing felt staged and exploitative of this young lady who is undergoing treatment and bald.. this is something that should have been left to the child to post imo not used for publicity. 🦴sure looks healthy, hairy and alot younger funny how that happens, didn’t her treatments just end last month?

**Nic919:** She also made the girl who has been given a short time left come to visit her. This despite confirming she is cancer free. 

_This was a common complaint repeated throughout the comments - Kate forced that poor girl to come to the castle! Never mind the fact that Liz specifically wanted to go to the castle._

**The Duchess:** It’s a cute gesture, but **Kitty should have been doing this months ago**. It shouldn’t have taken Good King Harry doing proper work in NYC and Lesotho, and the backlash from that tragic cancer commercial to get to this point. 

_Ah yes, months ago. Like when she was going through her own chemotherapy? Or when she was recovering from abdominal surgery?_

**Miss Scarlett:** I’m glad she’s finally doing more “work,” but this particular setup and the photos reek of self promotion and also the juxtaposition of “dying bald cancer patient” and “glorious cancer warrior Kate.”",12,1728101603.0,CelebitchyUnderground,4,1.0,False
