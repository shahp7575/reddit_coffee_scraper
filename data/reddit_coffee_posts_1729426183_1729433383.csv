1g7z5zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g7z5zw/urinating_constantly/,Urinating Constantly,"Hello, I'm a 26m and for a good few years now I have an issue with the amount of times I am urinating each day. I drink about 2ltrs of water plus tea/decaf coffee so I would expect to go often, but on a regular day I end up going to the toilet about 20-25 times.   
  
What feels like is happening is that each time I go, I don't 'flush out' all the liquid. As an example - I take the train into work, I will usually have my last drink of water at 9pm, go to the toilet before bed, maybe wake up in the night as well (not all the time), I then need to go straight away after waking up, I drink a tiny amount of water (100ml or so) just to wake myself up, I then go to the toilet before leaving the house, then again at the station (40mins after waking up, 20 mins after previously going), and by the time I'm at the station on the other side I need to go again (about 1 hour and 20mins on the train).  
  
From my perspective I am now urinating 4 times in 2hours after drinking only 100ml, this sort of pattern cotinues throughout the day so it feels like every time I drink something my body 'dripfeeds' the need to urinate over the next few hours rather than just going once.   
The other issue is how desparately I need to go each time - whenever it comes on I absolutely cannot hold on for long at all, I now basically don't drink any water if I know I'm going somewhere in the day where a toilet may not be easily accessible. If I do dehydrate myself there isn't as much of an issue (in the above example of the train journey, if I didn't drink again until after lunch I wouldn't need to go after the fourth time even if eating).   
  
I don't have any other medical issues apart from being coeliac. Thank you very much in advance if anyone can help at all! ",1,1729432289.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

A little bit about me...  I do not smoke tobacco, I just used to smoke 1 joint a day (mostly at night), recently I decided to stop because I  thought like, why do I even smoke!?.

It's been 3 weeks and not that I have craves or something like that, but when I am bored, I just miss being high and stoned.

I'm thinking of just going to the coffee shop and getting a G but yeah... there are moments where I think is a great idea and others where I think I should stay sober. But fuck is so boring to be sober in my free days.

What do you guys think? 

Is it okay to smoke weed once in a while?

I'm on so many dating apps it's not even funny. I have Match, Hinge, Archer, Tender, eHarmony, Okay Cupid, Coffee meets bagel, and even Facebook dating. I'll get matches, but they're never responding. I'll use money to message them right away and just get a response back then telling me I'm ugly. So I want to try this speed dating thing. I only see two problems with that with me. Number one, I don't like big groups and number two I have ASD. Any tips? I would say social cues are a big issue with my ASD I also seclude myself from other people, I have a fear of abandonment, which I feel like if I get to know someone I'm always afraid they're going to leave. That has put stress on new relationships as it did on past ones. I'm not really great at meeting new people I am a very shy individual so I feel like if I were to go I wouldn't talk that much and wouldn't allow the other person to get to know me.

I 2019 I had a job with a Nespresso machine in the break room. It didn't look exactly like the one the one pictured but it was very close. I don't think this is the same model because the one at that job used the dome shaped Vertuo Nespresso pods and this one seems to only use the Original pods. The pods would go into the top of the machine and you'd push the lever down like this one though. 

I remember my boss saying the Nespresso machine in the break room was old at the time but I don't know how old. It worked great and I loved the taste of the coffee it made. I really want to buy the same model but I want to buy the newer version. Since I can't find the name of the model I can't be certain that I'm buying the correct one.

Does anyone know which model it could have been? Since it used Vertuo pods I believe it would have been a Vertuo machine but I really can't be certain. I would want it to make a cup of coffee like the old model did and not just espresso. I remember it had a small water tank on the back of it. ",2,1729432000.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

There had been many people who seen Ambrose Gennedario in the weeks leading up to his disappearance. Mashee had documented them all and had signed affidavits to the effect. He would pick through them. Now mostly in his mind. But every now and again he would open the boxes and shuffle through them. 

But nothing would stick out except the few loose ends that had always stuck out.

He saw the signed document in his mind with its cursive signature at the bottom. The hand that wrote it seemed to come alive again in his memory. A gentleman frequenter of the raucous parties at the Gennedario family estate. Not the little well to do cottage in Keythos. The estate proper. Ambrose birthplace and birthright.

“What was unusual that night?” Mashee could remember the feel of his own voice in his own head.

The face of memory replayed it perfectly: 

“He wasn’t interested in the dances or the drink. It was different.”

“He seemed to be worried about something.”

“What about his companions?”

“Them? They seemed to not notice. They drank and played poker.”

“His bodyguard?”

“He wasn’t there.”

“Where was he?”

“I don’t know. I was never in the inner circle. I stayed out of that killer’s way. But I will maintain he was never there.”

“I have three other witnesses that place him there that night.”

“Well I ain’t one of them.”

“Who did he, Ambrose, talk to?”

“Women mostly.”

“Anyone in particular?”

“That dark one. I don’t know her name.”

“By dark you mean?”

“She was dressed in black, like she just come from a funeral.”

“Were they happy? Upset? Tell me about their demeanor.”

The gentleman shifted in his chair, “Intrigued about something. I suspect they were talking over who was double crossing them.”

“Did you hear them? How would you come to that conclusion?”

“I was never near enough to hear a word. I just have my guess from what seems to have happened since.”

“So your best word was that they looked suspicious.”

“Yeah.”

Mashee blinked the memory away as another afternoon ticked by. He would keep going over the affidavits these long years but no one could tell him the name of the dark lady.



Chapter 5. The Desert.

Dom ordered a round of beer mostly to silence the hush that fell around the room. The music began again haltingly but it found its rhythm again. But the atmosphere had changed. Avery felt alone. But very much in the company of well trained and orderly merry-makers. Pedro had the faintest fold of a smile on the edges of his cheeks and on the upturn of his lips. His eyes shone with something other than beer. And after some glimmers of growing success Pedro played vehemently into again netting up losses.

“Pay up you little brownie!” Castor sneered drunkedly and threw his cards in Pedro’s direction. Pedro almost laughed in reply. Avery couldn’t help but chuckle with him. He was shaking with happiness. But there was also something threatening in Castor’s tone that Avery did not like.

Now, referencing Pedro’s skin, Avery found himself looking at him differently for the first time. Had Pedro always been in the sun? Why were none of his other uncles so well painted? Had he thought Pedro always dirty from working more than any other soul in town? If only to pay off his gambling debts? Avery’s mind began to buzz in a different sort of way with deep beer stained questions, but the questions had always been there begging for an answer. Beer only made him whine internally for the answer that no one at the table was talking about. It was almost more than he could handle, but he had learned to not open his mouth in front of his Uncles or he would be scolded for disrespect. Meanwhile Uncle Tom, Dom and Castor smoked the room out with the cigars Pedro had rolled from each man's home grown tobacco. It was thick enough that Avery’s eyes stung, but he had nothing better to do but sit with them until they saw there was no more fun to be had that didn't cost them more pains for the morrow that they did not feel up to paying 

For Avery the games could have ended much sooner. The moon was high by the time they, one by one, tottered off. Avery, without his usual accomplice, found himself walking home beside his best friend’s father down the narrow dusty roads to the opposite end of town from his own. 

“How much you owe?”

“A dollar to Dom. And a day’s work for Castor.” said Pedro as he fumbled in his pockets he tapped a pocket and seemed to find what he was looking for.

“They were pretty drunk Uncle Pedro.”

Pedro chuckled then laughed heartily, “Sometimes they are so drunk. They don’t even remember the next day.”
The two laughed together as they went. The questions that formed in Avery's mind earlier came back like a moth to its candlelight perch as Pedro lit the last of his three rationed cigars for the day. The first he smoked after breakfast and coffee as he prepared to begin work in the field. The second he smoked as he walked to the Goose. The third was for his walk home. Any superfluous smoking was at the donation of friends. 

“What was Aunt Josie running from?” Pedro didn’t look at him but drew deeply and expelled a cloud that stained the night with true black, but the edges of the smoke caught the silver linings of the moon.

“There are things in this world, Son.” he shook his drunken head, “We all need to run from.”

“Uncle Pedro, that ain’t an answer.”

Pedro was drunker than usual and he continued, “When you find you have to run. You will know it. But will you run fast enough? Can you run long enough? How will you know? And when the judge comes, how will you know it’s going to be good for you? Slow or quick? Eh? No one knows. If the judge says 'hang him!' Who says to the hangman 'let him go'? Who lets you go? When everyone is in the business of keeping? Everybody keeps. That's the root of it.”

Avery waited for the thought to fade in the desert of silence but found it only seemed to roll into the crunch of gravel under their feet.

“What did she run from?” Avery pried hoping the alcohol held the door open. Pedro watched the ground they walked on for a breath or so silently.

“I saved her.” Pedro nodded his head to himself but his voice sounded like someone found a dead hatchling bird. “She ran from here.”

“From what?”

“She ran for herself. No future here. She ran to…” but here Pedro shook his head.

“Is it too much to explai -” Avery began to say but Pedro cut him off.

“She got in trouble here and didn’t want to face it. Leaving made it worse. So I stopped it from happening. That’s how they let me be here.” the drunk tripped on a rock but somehow kept his balance “I look after Josie. That was life.” 

This answer silenced Avery. Pedro intoned his existence here as much a punishment as it was his delight. There was not a note of bitterness in his voice. These things all said clearly that all was not as it seemed. Not for the Delrios and not for Keythos. And that meant not for Avery either. The thought of conspiracy was not yet forming. He had never thought of it before. The elders were the elders because he had always been told that they handled the important decisions. But what was so important that Aunt Josie stay here if she had so desired to leave?

They came to the gate of Pedro’s house. And Pedro put the remainder of his cigar in the boy’s hand. And raised his finger to his lips with the other on the lad’s shoulder as if something more was to be said. Avery’s heart soared. First, to be given tobacco by the closest he had ever had to a father, marking him as he thought, as a man. And second the great welling of a secret seemed to drum like a tide against Pedro’s pursed lips. But as the man nearly burst he turned away. His strength to hold in had won out and waving good night Avery watched him walk up the porch steps. 

The moment his step reached the top a woman’s voice rang out from inside: 

“So you’re done losing at the Goose again?”

Avery saw the shadow of Pedro shrug at the door before he squared himself and shuffled through the dark frame. Josie’s voice said something indistinct. Then it grew sharper and heavy with contempt.

“You're drunk.” She spat louder than Pedro needed to hear. For Avery heard it clearly from the lane where he was still drawing on the remains of Pedro’s cigar. Pedro did not reply.

“You lost more money, I know that. Where’s Malcolm?” A low mumble of a voice replied followed by some clearing of his voice. Which not a few minutes before was so free of inhibition that he was adding smoke to it.

“You let my only son walk right out the Goose, under your supervision, in the middle of the night with a girl.” Josie’s voice postured like a colonel dressing down a sergeant. “What slut is he doing God knows what with -and with your permission?”

He cleared his throat again.

“Dom’s girl?” she shrieked, but then paused and calmly but with every tongue of flame that blame could thrust given her voice she pushed into her words, “And I bet you didn’t say a word. You spineless limp cactus of a man.”

“Dom no say - didn’t say- nothing neither.” Pedro managed an effort to defend himself. But it was a weak argument. Maybe he intended it to be weak. Because it seemed to be exactly what Josie wanted.

“That’s no excuse! You weak. Pathetic. Moraless man."" She very likely would have lit her own fuse, bitterness came to her voice like a thousand well honed knives ""God must have given up on you at birth. That’s why you’re cursed to work your whole life through and never keep a dollar to save your life.”

Pedro now said nothing in reply. And from the silence from the little abode Avery thought the disagreement and flair of temper was over. In reality, Pedro, having known this way of life for some years now had caught himself in a nasty web of argument. Where by defending himself he knew he was only inviting more abuse. But having already done it. He was hesitating to either say anything at all or find some reason outside himself for explaining why the world was suddenly flat, but he couldn’t seem to decide which way the crowd leaned. So he delayed. And this hesitation backed by his inclination to wait out the storm was signaled far too strongly and Josie sensed it immediately.

This time her voice issued out calm and sad, but this was just the blade for the poison: “God made you this way, I suppose, so I must accept your filthy ways and sin as the gift God gave to support me through this life of misery he’s blessed us with.”

Pedro sighed. Or exhaled from having held his breath.

“Oh, are you relieved?” Josie’s temper, baited itself, but loved the excuse of another’s weakness to prove it right, “Why? Why are you relieved?” 

A pause.

“Do you think my acceptance of your trash makes me feel any better?” 

If Josie had been a drinker Avery could have blamed liquor. But she had never been seen with any sort of bottle. He knew Josie had a temper, but generally she hid it in smiles and service, and only sometimes did it emerge occasionally as stinginess. 

The wife of Pedro went on, her voice clamoring incredulous: “Do you ever care to think how I feel about these decisions you get to make on your own with my son? About anything? I have lost everything to you. I never thought you would be the cause of me losing my son. I know you never loved me. I know you had to.” She began to sob in her anger, but her voice indicated her own wounded nobility. Pedro sat motionless. Avery’s eyes drooped with the effect of a beer and a long day. He would have nodded off had the severity of Josie’s voice not continued after a long dramatic pause.

“You never did anything I want.” 
“YOU never cared about my life.”
“You just take and take and take. I have nothing to give you anymore. Now that my son is out in the world and sowing his wild oats…”
“- and making decisions that he can’t take back.” Her voice quickened and enraged in tempo, “I don’t even want anything from you anymore. I haven’t in all the years I’ve known you. But you’ve raised my son to be just like you. I bet you're proud. I bet you are proud he’s just like you. That he’s never going to get out of this desert waste of a town, racking up debt and obligation to every stinking person he knows as family. And that is Your doing. YOU never think about how that makes me feel.” 

She inhaled sharply, the cat had found its prey and the claws went for blood “YOU never think about my reputation to a husband who is everyone’s worthless tool: who everyone is laughing up their sleeves at every time you can’t figure out a card game. YOU never think about me. I am married to the doormat of Keythos: But I REFUSE to be a doormat for any of them! Not Dom! Not TOM! AND NOT YOU!”

A door slammed and something rolled off the clay tile roof. Pedro paused a long time in silence by himself. Then without any warning he blew out the lantern and sat back in his chair and began to gently snore. 

The mind of the meek kept to itself; but the mind of anger lets all show. But who is really stronger? The one who could win and puts up no defense? Or the one screaming under the pressure that life will inevitably bring?

Avery shook himself awake to a silence that was better than the bad dream of reality that had just unfolded in front of him. But he was not in his bed. He was still standing in the lane with cold ash draped across his knuckles. He regarded the fireless tobacco regretful that he had not taken full advantage. So he tossed the cigar aside and set out for home. The questions that followed him were the predictable one’s.

Did Aunt Josie love Pedro? Did she ever? And this immediately led to: Do all married people get like this? Avery did not know. How could he know? -being a decade and a half old? He had never been married and his own mother had raised him having never had his father there to speak to much less fight with.

The title of father spoken by our children is of the oddest and oldest. What it means is: our mother’s lover who began ourselves in her. But even without love we are begun. Even without the intent to have an inheritor of attributes and possessions; we are all begat. Where the love falls is only clear by the man who begets. 

Avery, having never met his father, having never had a lover: thought of none of these things. To him, his father was assumed to have loved his mother and had only chosen her in the effort of obtaining the gem that was himself. But had, despite all excitement, died tragically before they were able to meet.

So, to Avery, to see his best image of father he knew berated and chastised by the one who held the title of his wife; left him feeling twisted and wrong. As if he had witnessed a man walk up the wall and across the ceiling in the middle of the night. The law of love had been crossed, and the law of marriage was supposed to hold that up: but it did not. It had not. So was all marriage open to this contrivance of anti-love? Was it so simple that the wind of circumstance blow all life until, as a bare canyon, it's only life is the shrill whistle from the flute of the dead?

Avery neared home, realizing now that his body ached. That all this time he had been oblivious, but in the first time of being alone he began to feel his limbs asking for rest. And he looked forward to his bed.

And there on the porch waiting in the flicker of lantern light was his mother sitting up with her reading and patiently awaiting her son’s return. She embraced him gently and quietly ushered him inside. 

“How is Malcolm?” she asked kindly.

“He’s fine.” Avery responded.

“Where did you go this afternoon?”

“The pool down the gulch.” Avery pulled his boots off and set them by the door. 

Elise made that motherly affirmation.

“Nothing dangerous then?”

“Nothing out of the ordinary.” Avery reasoned.

“Anything interesting down there?”

“A lot of rocks. I found a couple agates.” he did, actually like collecting agates and would find them winking at him in certain angles of light. He pulled a few from his pocket and Elise looked them over and approved before she set them in the windowsill where a large glass jar sat waiting for the morning sun to radiate them.

“You weren't all the way out there this late were you?”

“Oh no. Malcolm and me went to the Goose after.”

“Of course. I don’t mean to worry. I am glad you have friends.”

“Ma?”

“Yes?”

“Tom told the story tonight.”

“What story? And Tom? He rarely says anything.”

“Well he was drunk, and happy. I think he was happy he was smiling anyways. He told the one about Pedro finding Josie.”

“And what did he say?”

“Nothing new really. He said just that. But you knew Josie back then didn’t you?”

“She was a tich younger than me. I had met her. She never seemed to want to be friends exactly. But we would be at the same dances.”

“Do you know why she ran away?”

“I do.”

“Well…why?”

“I speculate a good bit. But there are some of us who never left this little town. Many have a sense of adventure great enough to want to leave it behind, most come back though.”

“But everyone is here. There is no place to go to.”

“She was bored of the people as much as the place. I assume that’s a large part of it. And I think why it was hard for her to come back. It was a great big scandal at the time.Thank God that’s been over years ago.” 

“Did you ever want to leave?” her boy asked.

“I have thought of it. But I am not a young single girl anymore. People look at widows differently. We have a place of having had what we wanted but are allowed to have our own minds on things. But I don’t think I will ever leave. I have too many memories here. I would miss this house.”

“I have thought of seeing other towns. But I don’t know if I could trust anybody. I think I would be a bit uneasy.”

“People can be trusted. Just you have to find the right ones. But that is different, heartbreaking really, to learn. I’ve seen some people who will only act reliably under oath and contract. Others who seem to make their words as good as their acts. It is a hard thing.”

“It seems to me that nothing is straightforward when it comes to people.”

“For the most part, I agree.” said the woman with a smile on her face, “Just try not to be too put out when people let you down.”

“What if I let you down?”

“My boy, I would try to understand you as best as I could. But that doesn’t mean I will understand. I’ll always think the best of you Avery.”

The boy smiled and laid himself down.

And seeing that, shortly after laying down, he was fast asleep; she again smiled to herself.

The wide brown eyes of Elise spoke in a deep well of kindness. But with a kind of surrender to life. An ease by existence that somehow the worst of life was over and the remainder of mediocre pains that could come were nothing more than light conversation. And the joys of what remained? That is what her face found; in her tea, in her reading, in the choosing of meals for her and her son, in the matching of what to wear or the tactile feel of a particular weave of linen. But most of all she had seen it in the face of her husband. Who had been gone these long years. So naturally the next best thing was the face of her own son.

She was thin, probably too thin to be healthy. Her form was draped in fine clothes, and in a fine house but her face wore deep lines across her sorrowful cheeks. She was by no means a beauty. As her beauty was not in her skin or complexion, which was left scarred by pox, or in long hair, for she had gotten lice more than once and had cut it off. But the beauty was in her eyes lighting up. And somewhere in the recesses of her childhood she had made the connection to the joy in others and the joy that led from her heart and out her eyes. This would make man and woman swoon of heart for her. Because they seemed to feel what her eyes would emit.

But if one was not looking to her eyes then you would see a frail widow, of middling money, who looked sad and wore clothes that seemed large enough to sail her little frame away over the desert. 

And still her eyes would glisten as she lay down to sleep. Something clean in the way her face would touch the sheets. It was the feeling of a small death overtaking her. Not in pursuit of our terror like we dream our ending pursues us, but to the drift and murmur and mercy of the eternal soaking away of our pains like a rush of perfect water.

Davenport’s the kind of place that never changes, but it never stays the same either. The skyline shifts with every crooked deal, every handshake made in a back room. The streets wear you down like an old pair of shoes—slow, steady, until you’re left wondering how you ended up with holes in your soul. It’s not the kind of city where people come to start fresh. No, Davenport’s a graveyard for second chances, a place where good men get buried and the bad ones keep digging.

I should know. I’ve spent most of my life here, watching it crumble from the inside out, brick by brick. I’ve been one of the good guys—long enough to know it doesn’t get you much more than a bad back and a pack of regrets. But every now and then, the city throws something at you, a bone or maybe a live grenade, and you’ve got to decide which one it is before it blows up in your face.

The name’s Vincent Brawshaw. Private investigator. Thirty-nine years old. Too many cases under my belt and too few reasons to keep taking them. Some days, I wonder if I’m still in this line of work because I don’t know how to quit, or if it’s because I can’t. Maybe I’m just waiting for the city to swallow me whole, the way it does to everyone who stays here long enough.

I used to be a cop. A damn good one, too, before everything went sideways. My sister—Rose—she was everything to me. Smart, funny, the kind of person who could light up a room just by walking into it. But that didn’t matter the night she got killed by some drunk behind the wheel. A drunk who had the right connections, the kind that kept him out of jail. The department turned a blind eye—too much pressure from higher-ups, too many palms being greased.

I pushed for justice, but the higher I climbed, the more doors got slammed in my face. The more I realized the system was rigged. When it came down to it, Rose’s life didn’t matter—not against the weight of political favors and rich friends. That was the night I quit being a cop, in every sense of the word. They didn’t fire me right away—I walked out before they had the chance. But I was done. I wasn’t one of them anymore.

Tonight, I wasn't chasing leads on missing persons or following cheating husbands. I’m driving through this godforsaken city, but not because of a case. It’s because of a woman. Funny how it always seems to start that way. A woman, a few bad decisions, and before you know it, the city swallows you whole.

Margaret Sullivan. Thirty-four years old. I’ve known her for a little over ten years, ever since our paths crossed back in ’46. She was singing at The Stardust Lounge, going by Daisy Valentine back then. Even now, I can still hear that voice—smooth as silk, the kind that makes you forget your troubles for a few minutes. But it wasn’t just her voice. It was the way she carried herself, like she had the whole world fooled. But not me. I could see there was something deeper behind all that confidence, something she kept hidden, even from herself.

I fell for her then. Hard. I’ve been falling ever since, trying to catch my breath between the times we’re on and the times we’re off. Right now? We’re off. But that doesn’t mean I can ignore her, not with her kid brother tangled up in something dark.

Edward Sullivan—twenty-three years old, and still green behind the ears. He’s been making deals with people whose names don’t belong in polite conversation. I’ve seen his type before, the kind that thinks they can walk a tightrope between right and wrong without falling off. But Davenport doesn’t work that way. You either keep your hands clean or you end up sinking. And Eddy? He’s sinking fast.

Margaret doesn’t see it, though. She’s always been too protective of him. The way she talks about him, you’d think he was still that wide-eyed kid who followed her everywhere, innocent and untouchable. But I know better. The streets don’t care how much you love someone—they’ll chew ‘em up and spit ‘em out just the same. I’d rather not be the one to bring it to her. But this city has a way of forcing your hand, and I’ve been dealt mine.

My navy blue Oldsmobile grunted nervously as it turned down Van Dyke Lane, a road I was just as intimately familiar with as the woman who lived on it, though I hadn’t driven down it in a while. Not since Margaret told me she was seeing someone else—a banker or investor, or something to do with money. Not a man whose work involved dirtying his hands. The jazz on the radio attempted to filter out the soft rain that landed all around me, like thousands of paratroopers landing behind enemy lines.

Her house came into view, the porch light cutting a neat rectangle of warmth into the wet pavement. House number Five-Five-Two. A small, cozy bungalow set a little too perfectly among the rest of the street’s sagging, tired homes. The white siding looked freshly painted, the porch steps spotless, and the front door—a deep, welcoming blue—seemed like it had been scrubbed clean just that morning. The windows, framed by neat little curtains, were drawn tight, as if shutting out the mess of the city. Margaret’s place felt like a holdout from a life she wanted, but never quite had. A slice of normalcy in a city that didn’t know what normal was.

I parked the Olds just shy of the driveway, killing the engine but leaving the keys in the ignition—old habits. Margaret’s red ’55 Thunderbird sat there like a jewel, sleek and polished, even in the rain. It had that unmistakable look of something well cared for, the kind of car that turns heads but doesn’t belong on these streets. But Margaret always liked to keep up appearances. The hardtop gleamed under the streetlight, a striking contrast to the gray, drab world around it.

I pulled a Marlboro from the pack, lighting it with a flick of my thumb. The smoke curled up and out of the cracked window, disappearing into the night. It had been months since I’d seen Margaret, but tonight wasn’t just about her.

The rain drummed against the roof of the car as I sat there, watching the house. I could picture her inside, moving through the small living room like she always did—pacing, smoking, maybe flipping through one of those magazines she pretended to care about. The place was too perfect, too untouched, like she was holding back the reality of Davenport with every neat line and polished surface.

I flicked the cigarette out the window after a few minutes of stalling, watching the embers die in the rain. Stepping out of the car, I remembered to grab my keys before pulling my coat tight against the downpour and made my way to her front door. The wood creaked under my boots, too clean, too well-kept for a place like this city. The brass knocker gleamed in the porch light, and for a second, I hesitated. It was a quarter past ten. The last thing I wanted was to upset whatever fragile balance we still had. But this wasn’t about me or her. This was about Eddy—and the fact that his neck was getting more twisted by the day.

Three knocks, sharp and quick, echoed in the stillness. The rain kept falling.

Footsteps shuffled inside, hesitant, like she wasn’t sure who would be standing there at this hour. The lock clicked, and the door opened just enough for her face to appear in the narrow crack.

“Vince?” she said, her voice softer than I remembered.

I didn't say a word.

Her eyes met mine—those deep, ocean-blue eyes that always made it hard to keep things simple. There was a pause, long enough for me to see the mix of surprise, caution, and something else behind them. The door creaked open a little wider, and there she was—Margaret Sullivan. The sight of her standing there, framed by the warm glow from inside, made everything else fall away. The rain, the cold, even the city—they all faded into the background, leaving just her.

Her blonde hair was down, cascading over her shoulders like it always did when she was at home. It wasn’t the neat, pinned-up look she wore when she was at work or out on the town. This was the Margaret I knew best, the one who didn’t bother with appearances when she didn’t have to, the one who looked her most beautiful when she was at ease. Her hair caught the soft light behind her, framing her face in loose waves, with a few strands falling against her cheek, making her look both effortlessly elegant and real.

She was wearing a simple rose gold dress, something soft and comfortable, the fabric hugging her figure just enough to show off the curves that always seemed to hold my attention. Margaret had never been slim like the women you’d see on billboards or in magazines, and I liked that about her. She had a natural fullness, a bottom-heavy figure that gave her a kind of earthy, real beauty. The dress clung to her wide hips, flaring out just below her waist, and the way it moved with her as she shifted was mesmerizing, like watching someone perfectly at home in their own skin. The soft curve of her stomach was there, too, adding to her natural, feminine shape—she carried her weight well, with the kind of confidence that never needed to be flaunted.

""Vince,"" she said my name once more, her voice carrying that familiar warmth, though it was laced with something else—caution, maybe. ""I wasn’t expecting you.""

""Yeah,"" I managed to say, my voice rougher than I intended. ""I wasn’t expecting me either.""

Her lips quirked into a small smile, one that didn’t quite reach her eyes, but it was there, brief as it was. She glanced down for a moment, her hand still resting on the door as if she hadn’t fully decided whether to let me in or not. After a moment or so which almost seemed like a lifetime, she gave in.

""You’re soaked,"" she said, her voice softening a bit, eyes tracing over me. ""Do you want to... come in?""

I nodded, the words sticking in my throat. She stepped aside, and I moved past her, into the warmth of the house. As I crossed the threshold, I caught a whiff of her perfume—something light, familiar, and instantly grounding. She closed the door behind me, the sound of the rain muffled now, like the outside world had been shut out along with it.

I stood there for a second, letting the warmth of the place sink in. It was just like her—quiet, organized, with little touches of life scattered in the corners. I glanced at her as she lingered by the door, brushing a strand of hair back behind her ear. The small smile had vanished, replaced with that same guarded look.

""Can I get you a drink?"" she asked, moving toward the kitchen without waiting for an answer. ""I was about to pour myself one.""

""Sure,"" I said, following her into the living room, though I wasn’t sure what I was agreeing to—whether it was the drink or just being here at all.

As I stepped into the room, it was like walking straight into the past. The place hadn’t changed, not really. Same neat little touches, the magazines stacked just so on the coffee table, the faint scent of her perfume hanging in the air like a ghost. I’d spent more nights than I could count in this room—back when things were different, when we were different.

I could picture it all too easily—Margaret curled up on that leather couch, her legs tucked beneath her, the soft light from the fireplace casting shadows across her face. The record player in the corner would be spinning something slow and smooth just like it was now, and we’d sit there for hours, pretending the world outside didn’t exist. Just us, wrapped in the quiet, the city a million miles away.

We used to talk about everything and nothing, her voice lulling me into some kind of peace I hadn’t found anywhere else. I’d watch her from across the room, the way her hips swayed when she moved, the way her smile made my heart beat faster. The memories came flooding back, washing away the months that had passed since I last stepped foot in this place. The distance between us felt more like an illusion.

It was here, in this room, that we had built whatever it was we had together. The good days, the nights when the whiskey flowed too easily, and the bad ones, when the silence stretched too long and too heavy between us. I could almost see her there now, a memory as real as the woman standing in front of me, stirring up things I thought I’d buried a long time ago.

There was a comfort to it, this room. Maybe that’s why I’d kept coming back, long after I knew better. Because for all the things that had fallen apart in my life, this place had always felt like a sanctuary. Margaret—she’d always made it feel that way, like the mess of the world couldn’t touch us here.

I removed my coat and hung it on the rack beside the door. Turning around, I found Margaret grabbing two glasses and a bottle from the small bar tucked in the corner. Her back was to me, and for a moment, I just watched her. It felt too familiar—too comfortable—and that made me more uneasy than anything else. I took a seat on her couch as she placed the glasses down on the coffee table and poured the amber liquid in silence before handing me one, her fingers brushing mine as she did. It was enough to make us both pause, to feel that same old spark that had always been there between us.

I looked up at her, but she was already moving to sit down across from me, sinking into the armchair by the window. Her eyes lingered on the drink in her hand for a moment before she took a small sip, her lips barely touching the rim. I followed suit, letting the whiskey burn a slow path down my throat.

We sat in silence for a while, the soft hum of the record player mixing with the muted patter of rain outside. It wasn’t an awkward silence, but it was heavy. There was too much left unsaid, and we both knew it.

""How’ve you been?"" I asked, finally breaking the quiet. It wasn’t the right question, but it was the only one I could manage right now.

Margaret’s eyes flicked up to meet mine, and for a second, I saw the walls come up behind them. She gave a small shrug before taking a sip of her drink. ""Same as always, I guess. Work’s busy, keeps me distracted."" She paused, her fingers tracing the edge of the glass absently. ""Not much else going on.""

""Still at the firm?"" I asked, trying to keep the conversation light.

She nodded, her blonde hair falling over her shoulder as she leaned back in the chair. ""Yeah, still there. Still doing the same thing, day in, day out. Nothing changes.""

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. It was the kind of smile you give when you’re trying to convince yourself that everything’s fine. But I knew Margaret too well to fall for that. There was something underneath the surface, something she wasn’t saying.

""And you?"" she asked, her voice softer now. ""What’s brought you back around? Especially at this hour?""

I felt the weight of her question settle between us. Eddy's name was right there, but I wasn’t ready to bring him up yet. I took a slow sip of the whiskey, letting it burn on the way down.

""Just... thinking about old times,"" I said, my voice quieter than I meant it to be. ""Figured I’d stop by.""

She looked at me for a moment, then nodded, her expression softening. ""Yeah... I’ve been thinking about those too.""

There was a pause, the silence between us heavy with everything left unsaid. She didn’t push, didn’t ask for more. Maybe she didn’t need to. She just watched me over the rim of her glass, like she was waiting for something. But I wasn’t ready to give it to her yet. Instead, I slipped back into old habits, falling into the easy rhythm of how things used to be.

""You still listening to the same old jazz?"" I asked, nodding toward the record player.

Margaret glanced over at it, her smile softening a little. ""Yeah. You know me—always stuck in my ways.""

I leaned back, letting the familiar music wash over me. It felt like being pulled back in time, back to when things were simpler, even if only on the surface. But that wasn’t what I was here for. Not really. The conversation had fallen into an easy rhythm, but there was something I still wanted to know, something that had been nagging at me since I turned down her street.

""How’s it going with... what’s-his-name?"" I asked casually, even though I already knew the answer before she said a word. “Charles, right?”

Margaret’s expression shifted, just for a second. It was brief—barely noticeable—but enough for me to see the crack in her armor. She set her glass down on the table and leaned back, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass absently.

""Charles and I... we broke it off,"" she said, her tone light, but not quite casual. ""It wasn’t working.""
I raised an eyebrow, waiting for more, but she didn’t elaborate. I knew that vague tone all too well.

""Wasn’t working?"" I repeated, my voice neutral. ""You sure about that?""

Margaret shrugged, her gaze flicking away from mine. ""It just wasn’t right. We... we wanted different things, I guess.""

I didn’t push for details. I’d learned over the years that Margaret would tell me what she wanted when she was ready. Instead, I let the silence stretch between us for a moment before glancing back over at the record player in the corner, jazz still softly filling the room.

“You still singing?” I asked, keeping my tone light.
Margaret looked up, her expression softening a bit.

“Yeah, now and then,” she said, her voice casual. “But don’t worry, I’m not going to Broadway anytime soon.”

I couldn’t help but smirk at that. “Didn’t think you’d need Broadway,” I said, leaning back. “You were always good enough on your own.”

Her smile faltered just a little, but it stayed there. “I still sing at the Stardust sometimes. It’s not what it used to be, though. I don’t know... maybe I’m just not what I used to be.”

I studied her for a moment, hearing the weight behind her words. “You miss it?”

She gave another small shrug before picking her glass back up and taking another sip from it. “Sometimes. But, like I said, I’m not chasing dreams anymore. Just something to keep me busy.”

She paused, staring into the amber liquid in her glass, the light catching the soft lines of her face. ""You know, there was a time when I thought maybe I could do more. Go further. But those days came and went. Now, it’s just... something familiar.
Something that reminds me of who I used to be.""

Her voice softened, almost like she was talking more to herself than to me. For a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of the old Margaret—the one who had that fire in her, the one who could command a room with just a song. But she shook her head, snapping out of it.

“And what about you?” she asked, raising an eyebrow, her tone lighter again. “Still hate me being up there for everyone else to watch?”

I chuckled, shaking my head. “I never hated it. Just didn’t like sharing.”

She gave me a look, knowing exactly what I meant. “You never had to worry about that, Vince. The stage... it was never about them.”

Her words hung in the air, carrying a bit more meaning than I’d expected. I took another sip of whiskey, letting the warmth settle in my chest.

There was a pause, the silence filling in the gaps between what she said and what she didn’t. I didn’t need to know the specifics. The fact that Charles was out of the picture meant something else entirely—something I wasn’t sure how to feel about. Maybe I shouldn’t have felt anything at all, but the truth was, knowing he was gone didn’t sit as lightly as I thought it would.

The silence stretched again, and I knew I couldn’t avoid it much longer. My fingers drummed lightly against the glass, the weight of what I had to say pressing down on me.

""Margaret,"" I started, my voice lower now. ""We need to talk.""

Her eyes snapped back to mine, and for a moment, I saw something flash behind them. She straightened in her seat, the warmth between us cooling almost instantly. She knew what was coming, even if she didn’t know the details yet.

""""What is it?"" she asked quietly, though there was a tightness to her voice now.

I hesitated, the words catching in my throat, but I forced them out. ""It’s about Eddy.""

Her face went pale for a second, but she recovered quickly, her fingers tightening around the glass as she set it down on the coffee table. She leaned back, her arms crossing over her chest like she was bracing herself for whatever came next.

“What about him?” she asked, her voice steady, but there was no hiding the tremor underneath.

I sighed, rubbing the back of my neck, trying to figure out how to put this. Eddy wasn’t just tangled up in something small. He was in deep, and I didn’t know how much she already knew, or how much she could handle.

“He’s gotten himself into trouble, Marge.” I kept my voice calm, trying to soften the blow, but the words still hit hard. “More trouble than he can get out of on his own.”

She stared at me, her eyes narrowing slightly. “What kind of trouble?”

I hesitated. “He’s been running with people he shouldn’t. Making deals that are going to get him hurt, or worse.”

Her jaw tightened. “You don’t know that, Vince. Eddy... he’s just trying to figure things out. He’s not an idiot.”

“Marge,” I said, my voice firmer. “I’ve seen it. He’s in deep, with the wrong kind of people. This isn’t something he can just walk away from.”

Her eyes flashed, and she set her glass down hard on the table, the tension between us thick enough to cut. “And that’s why you’re here, isn’t it?” she snapped, her voice rising. “You didn’t just stop by to check on me. You’re here to question me about my brother.”

I opened my mouth, but no words came out.

She stood, pacing across the living room, her arms crossed over her chest, her hair falling in loose waves around her shoulders. “You’ve been sitting here, pretending like this is some casual visit, like you just wanted to catch up, but really, you’re just here to get information on Eddy. God, Vince—if you were so worried, why didn’t you just come out with it?”

I couldn’t look at her. She was right. I’d tried to ease into it, tried to soften the blow, but that was a mistake. I should’ve known better. She wasn’t the kind of woman who wanted things sugarcoated, especially not when it came to Eddy.

“Marge, I didn’t want to blindside you,” I said quietly, standing up to face her. “Eddy—he’s mixed up in something dangerous, and I need to know what you know. You’re his sister. You’re the one he’d talk to.”

Her eyes flicked up to meet mine, a furnace burning behind them now. “And you think I’d hide something from you? From him? If I knew what was going on, you think I’d just sit here and do nothing?”

I took a step toward her, my hands open, trying to calm her down. “I’m not saying that, but I know you’d protect him if you could. I know how much you care about him.”

“Of course I care about him!” she shot back, her voice sharp. “He’s my brother, Vince! Do you think I don’t know how reckless he can be? Do you think I haven’t tried to help him? But he doesn’t tell me everything. He’s stubborn, just like you.”

The words hung in the air, the sting of them clear.

I sighed, running a hand through my hair. “Marge, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to come at you like this. I just... I need to figure this out before it’s too late.”

She shook her head, turning away from me, her arms still tightly crossed. “You should’ve been straight with me from the start, Vince. I don’t need to be coddled.”

“I wasn’t trying to coddle you.”

She let out a bitter laugh, finally turning to face me again. “No? Then what was this? You think I wouldn’t have helped you if you’d just come to me and told me the truth?”

I stepped closer, trying to meet her eyes. “I didn’t want to put you in the middle of this.”

“I’m already in the middle of this, Vince! I’ve been in the middle of it since the day Eddy was born.” Her voice cracked, and I could hear the frustration, the pain, in every word. ""I know what kind of trouble he’s in. I’m not blind to it. You don’t think I’m terrified for him every damn day?”

There was a silence after that, a heavy, suffocating silence. I could feel the weight of everything between us—our history, her love for Eddy, my reasons for being here. I’d messed up by not being honest with her from the start, and now I was paying for it.

“I’m sorry,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “I didn’t mean to hurt you.”

Margaret didn’t say anything at first. She just stood there, her eyes searching mine, as if trying to figure out if she could trust me again. Finally, she let out a long breath, her shoulders sagging a little.

“You already did,” she said quietly, and it hit me harder than I expected.

Margaret stood there, arms crossed, her gaze cold and distant. The warmth between us had been replaced by something harder, something I wasn’t sure I could fix. I wanted to say something, to bridge the gap, but before I could, she let out a long sigh and sank back into the armchair.

""You’re right,"" she said quietly, her voice steady but edged with defeat. ""He’s been... off lately. More secretive than usual. I thought maybe he was just trying to make something of himself, you know? Figuring things out on his own. But now... I don’t know.""

I didn’t say anything, just let her talk. I could feel the shift, that slow unraveling of the defenses she’d built up.

""He hasn’t said much to me directly,"" she continued, staring down at her hands as they rested in her lap. ""But I’ve overheard things. Little pieces of conversation when he thinks I’m not listening. Names I recognize... names that shouldn’t be involved with someone like Eddy.""

""Who?"" I asked, leaning forward slightly, my voice calm, but urgent.

She hesitated, chewing on her bottom lip like she wasn’t sure she should tell me. Finally, she glanced up, her eyes flicking to mine, then away again.

""Crocetti,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""He’s been talking about meeting someone named Crocetti.""

The name hit me like a punch to the gut. Crocetti. He wasn’t just some small-time thug. He was big—connected to all the wrong people, the kind of people who could make someone like Eddy disappear without a trace.

""Jesus, Margaret,"" I muttered, rubbing my hand over my face. ""You didn’t think to tell me this sooner?""

Her eyes flashed, that fire back for a moment. ""I didn’t know it mattered, Vince! I hear names all the time at work, people coming in and out of the firm. Half the time, I don’t even know who they are. But Crocetti... I recognized it. I wasn’t sure it was the same person.""

""And now?""

She sighed again, shaking her head before collecting her half empty glass from the coffee table. ""I’m still not sure. But it doesn’t feel right. The way Eddy talks about him... it’s like he’s in too deep, like he’s already made promises he can’t get out of.""

I leaned back, processing what she’d just told me. Crocetti wasn’t the type to play games. If Eddy was mixed up with him, then the kid was running out of time. And fast.

Margaret’s hands fidgeted with her glass, her voice softer now. ""I’ve tried to get Eddy to open up, to tell me what’s going on, but he just brushes me off. Tells me not to worry. But I am worried, Vince. I don’t want to lose him.""

The room felt colder all of a sudden, the air between us thick with things neither of us wanted to say. I’d come here for answers, and now that I had them, I wasn’t sure what to do with them. The weight of Eddy’s choices, of Margaret’s concern, hung heavy in the room.

I met her gaze, my voice low. ""We’ve got to get him out, Margaret. Crocetti doesn’t give second chances.""

She looked down, her fingers tightening around the armrest. The seriousness of it all hung between us, heavy as a lead weight. But I could feel the shift. Despite everything, despite the danger Eddy was in, there was something else beneath the surface—something unresolved between us.

""Why do you always do this?"" she whispered, her voice barely holding together. ""Why do you always come back when things are falling apart?""

I took a step toward her, my voice softer now, but firm. ""Because I care about you, Marge. I’ve always cared about you.""

Her eyes met mine, and for a moment, the coldness cracked. There was a vulnerability there, one I hadn’t seen in a long time. ""Then why don’t you ever say it?""

The question hit me harder than I expected, and I knew this was it. I couldn’t run from it anymore. Not with everything on the line.

""I love you, Margaret,"" I said quietly, the words steady. ""I’ve always loved you. I just didn’t know how to say it.""

She blinked, the surprise flickering across her face before something else—something warmer—began to take its place. ""Say it again,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

""I love you,"" I repeated, stepping closer, my hand brushing against her arm. ""I should’ve told you sooner. I never should’ve let you go.""

For a long moment, she didn’t move, just stood there, processing. Then, slowly, she reached up, her fingers lightly grazing my cheek as she looked at me with a mix of relief and something deeper.

Before I knew it, she pulled me in, her lips pressing softly against mine. It started tentative, like she wasn’t sure we should be doing this, but then the kiss deepened, her arms sliding around my neck as the years between us seemed to disappear.

I held her, pulling her close, the weight of Eddy’s situation still heavy but distant, at least for tonight. She kissed me like we had lost time to make up for, and I kissed her back with the same urgency, knowing that come morning, everything would still be waiting for us. But right now, in this moment, it didn’t matter.

Her fingers tangled in my hair as we stumbled toward the couch, the room spinning with the heat of old memories, unresolved feelings, and the love we both knew had always been there but never spoken. As we sank onto the cushions, I pulled her closer, my hand sliding down her back, feeling her warmth, the press of her body against mine.

She broke away for a second, her forehead resting against mine, breathless. ""I missed you,"" she whispered, her voice shaky.

""I missed you too,"" I murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her face before kissing her again.

But even as I kissed her, I couldn’t push it aside completely. Eddy was still out there, tangled up in something that could destroy him. The weight of it hung in the back of my mind, gnawing at me, reminding me that this wasn’t over—not for him, not for any of us.

Margaret’s hand trailed down my chest, pulling me back into the present, her touch warm and familiar. I held her tighter, letting myself fall into the moment, just for tonight. Tomorrow, I’d deal with the mess waiting for us outside. I’d figure out how to save Eddy.

But right now? Right now, it was just us.

The rain drummed softly against the window as we lost ourselves in each other, the world outside forgotten for a little while. Eddy would be alright tonight. And for the first time in months, so would we.",1,1729431765.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I have a few questions:  
-I never cut tiles that are 2cm thin. They say use a diamond continuous blade to avoid chiping. The question is: Do I attempt to cut it in one pass or multiple passed going deeper and deeper? (I can probably do it with a certain precison because I built myself a sliding wet saw (see [this thread ](https://www.johnbridge.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=134479))  
I am tempted to say that one pass should be doable and less prone to errors

-their instructions recommend leaving like 1/2"" between the tiles and adjacent walls to leave room for expansion. Isn't that too much ?

-what width for the grout line: I am inclined to go with 1/8""

-what spacers to use: they say use special outdoor spacers -but I can't find lots of them at the big box stores (Rona/Lowes and Home Depot). Qep is selling something on Amazon 10CAD for 20 pieces but I can't say I like the price. I have their wedges and pliers but not sure if there are any spacers than can be used with these 2cm thick tiles

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

He shows signs of irritableness. I know he wants to nap longer. 

I’ve been reading up on naps and sleep cycles. Should I try to “save the nap” and cosleep with him to get that 1.5-2hrs? I’m just desperate for a little break since I’m home all day by myself. Do some babies just want 30 mins to sleep? 

Any breastfed coslept friendly approaches to naps? Yes he will nap in the car or stroller.

Those are the listing photos. We got rid of the couch and the wardrobes/cabinets are going next. How would you design the living room area? Id like to get a small reading nook or workspace in if its possible. Also a couch and a tv, possibly some small library. We cannot change the kitchen, kitchen island or the wooden wall thingys. Everything needs to be back as it is when we give the apartment back, you get the drill. 

The kitchen space is very tiny so if I got some cabinets to put some kitchen stuff too would be nice... 

We like vintage/mid century modern interiors.. I made a visionboard so I included that. I dont think the colours work tho, haha (I was trying to make my favorite colours work togwether, haha). But it is more about the style/feeling you know? If you have some suggestions about what to do or even an idea in a different direction than Id like to go in, please share your ideas! Id love to know what you think.. I need inspirations I feel that it has potencial but I have no Idea what to do... the ceilings are also very high, forgot to say, haha. 

Sooo... my main issues are:

What lights should we choose? 

Where to put the couch?

What kind of cabinetry/furniture to get? (We have almost nothing, haha... just a coffee table Im not sure I wanna keep and old couch Id like to replace).

1g7ypqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1g7ypqa/ex_landlord_threatening/,Ex Landlord Threatening,"Hello Reddit users,

I have a question about my ex landlord's attitudes towards me after 8 months since I have moved out of the room (WG).

My ex-landlord have not paid my 480 euros deposit back due to some damages in his objects in the room. While some of these damages are valid (such as stain on the coffee table and 1 piece of missing wood in balcony chair), most of them are unreal damages which I've been accused of.

Because of this I've become a member of a Mieterverein but haven't had chance to have a meeting yet.

As a background information, our rental contract did not have a list of items section and also we did not have a handover document. And he was the main tenant of the house while I was the subrenter.

5 months after I've moved out of the place, the landlord told me that his speakers are not working and I told him they were working when I left. (I told him to not blame for the damages in his objects after all of these months because they were working properly when I left the place and also told him to contact me through his Mieterverein because he has threatened me before about the objects)

Now, after 8 months, he claims that I broke his record player and he's going to ""fuck me up"" whenever he sees me.

Any suggestions on how to take action against this? Thank you.

1g7yn5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1g7yn5e/fucking_coffee_shop_people/,Fucking Coffee Shop People,"So I went to a coffee shop today and low and behold they were just cruel. 

I am fucking tired. I was out all last night, had to get up early to go to work and thought I'd get something before I got to work. I usually order online but the online app was down so I had to do it in person. 

And my god. If I didn't already think I had something along the lines of autism/adhd/ocd I'd definitely be questioning what the fuck was wrong with me... with the way they were to me I felt like an alien!

So I got to the cafe and asked if they had hot drinks cause the app said they didn't. They said yes so I ordered my drink. It was a plain the simple order and I said it in full to start off with to avoid confusion. They start to make it and take someone else's order as well. 

As one of the staff members goes to get food for my order, the other asks if I want marshmallows (I already answered this but sure). But a second ago she was fucking talking to the guy behind me so I took a moment to answer and asked if she meant me. She looked irritated and said yes and so in my panic I answered yeah no. Yeah no = no anyway... but she gave me a critical and confused look so I had to repeat myself with a firm no. Another one or two things put me off during this interaction and left me feeling worried about my next. 

Eventually I take my stuff and go sit down for 5 minutes. My plan was to eat this and drink my drink for 5 minutes before ordering my colleagues cause I didn't want it to get cold. 

So I go back in the queue and they look pissed to start off with. Like what did I do? And then they do the thing where as I'm in the queue behind the person being served but they take my order. But I'm not paying attention cause I'm fucking tired and I'm second in line. So the lady behind the counter says hello over and over so quickly and loudly that by the time I registered she was speaking to me she had said it loudly for the whole shop to hear about 5 times. And of course i make a worse fool of myself by being all stuttery with my answer. She was so fucking impatient. 

Like come the fuck on. I've obviously got something up with me at this point. Was there any need to be so fucking hostile? And the looks they gave me were just dirty. 

I want to say I'll never go back but I probably will due to the place serving things I like. But I'm staying online for sure. 

My confidence is knocked and next time I order I'm gonna feel like a vulnerable alien. Thanks a lot dickheads. 

I'd never treat my customers like the way you treated me. At least give them a moment to register and respond... How hard is it!?

Today I was seated having brunch on my own at a cafe in a suburb that I guess could be considered a little rough. As I was just about to leave, a young man with tattoos on his face and who appeared to look homeless walked up to me and asked if I could buy him a cup of coffee. He even had his own mug with him. 

I work in mental health disability, so naturally I have a soft spot for vulnerable people and especially younger men due to personal reasons in my own life. I do try and help the homeless where I can, but never give money always items or food, so I was more than happy to help. 

We get to the counter, I pay for the both of us, and he’s struggling to hold eye contact. I ask him how his day was otherwise and try to engage in small talk. Once the payment went through, I wished him well and said goodbye. He finally looked directly at me and said “thanks for treating me like a human being, no one does that.” I smiled and nodded and off I went. 

This broke my heart and I’ve spend the remainder of the day thinking about it. Working in my field and being so passionate about social justice, I resent that people like him are so often mistreated and forgotten in society.

one day after another exam i came our first out of the classroom and she came out right after me so i decided fuck it today is the day i’ll like properly talk to her so i asked her how did she do and we just started talking and chatting. after that one day we were left tgt alone for like couple of hours and we talked about life and you know everything and she told me like “everyone in our class is so straight” i HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS EVEN TO THIS SAY after she said that i was like “you are so right everyone is sooooo hetero” and she looks at me like fucking crossing her legs and batting her eyelashes “what do you think i am?” and i panicked so hard i made like a stupid joke so i still have no idea bro.

after that we went to this bar with all of pour friends, she came with her roommate and she looked so cute and i said that right when i saw her i said “you look so fucking cute” she started blushing and saying thank you, she sat down right in front of me at the table and we were on the table outside and there was this man passing with roses that we could buy, and i was like “do you want a rose? i’ll buy it for you?” she said “stooopp” i literally would but i didn’t have cash on me and she said “last time he had rainbow roses for lgbtq” I WAS LIKE HUUUHHH???


later on i found out bc one of my friends that was there told me that they talked about me having literal heart eyes for her and she apparently said that she noticed it too.

after that i was at the library for lunch with all of my friends and she texts me on ig I WAS SHOOK WHEN I SAW THE NOTIFICATION she said “heeeyy where are u? do you mind if we eat together?” and i immediately texted back saying ofc but im with other people she said that it was completely ok and she joined us, later that day my friends had another class and i didn’t so they went to class and she texted me asking where i was i told her and she joined me so it was us two for like couple hours as well and she had an exam later so i told her that i could help her study a little bc im quite good at that subject and we did laughing and joking in the middle of all of that she kept showing me things on twitter and we just had a good time.

she went to her exam and i decided to wait for her but obviously she didn’t know i just acted like i had shit to do and i saw her leaving so she called me over and was like “thank you so much i think i aced the exam” we took the subway tgt and went home tgt that day. 

after that they had a class that i didn’t have but i went to it bc the teacher told me that i could come, they had like presentations and i wanted to see, so we come into the classroom and we sit down she calls my name and is like sit right here and points at the seat next to her, that was our last day of classes before the big exams and i had made cookies for my favorite professor and i took one to give to her so i got the cookie out of the bag and offered it to her she said no im ok i was like BRO I TOOK THIS JUST FOR YOU she said that she was ok so i turn around and there was this other girl behind us i was like “do you want this cookie? i made it” and the crush looks at me and goes “you didn’t tell me you made it i want it too” so the girl that i gave the cookie to broke it in half and gave it to her she said that it was delicious. the class started and she started talking about zodiac signs to me which i have no idea about and she was like capricorns are the best i said “i don’t have any capricorns in my life” she said “you have me” and the whole time she was like touching my arm my hand while she would laugh and yh the vibes were vibing. 

so after the class we are leaving to go home and it was me her and my friend, she looks at me and she goes “do you wanna go for a coffee?” i said “sure, all of us?” she said no just you and me mind you at this point everyone knows that i have a crush on her. so we leave to go to the coffee shop she opens up about her life her family and etc and her roommates calls her and she’s like “i’m going to get coffee with” and she said my name she hangs up and im like she knows who i am? and she’s like “yh she knows everyone i hang out with” so we go to this coffee place and we sit down drink coffee laugh blah blah blah. 

another day comes and it’s our last day of class she’s sitting behind me and we laugh and like joke around with all of our friends and she calls me by a nickname no one has ever called me and she’s like “look i got a new tattoo” and she was wearing a skirt and she shows me the tattoo that was on her thigh she’s like “i got it yesterday so if you touch be careful” she takes my hand and puts it on the tattoo gently” and i was like it’s so pretty and it’s true her tattoos are all very pretty. that day all of us are tgt and we all had a great time. 

comes the big exams so we have this one exam and i got out of the classroom waiting for all of them and we all leave the school building and she goes “do yall wanna go and have a drink after this horrible exam?” and 5 of us say yes so me my friend another fiend with her bf and her we go to this bar. again tables outside we sit on it and they all sit down and i have one place left next to my friends boyfriend but she said “(my name) take the chair and come sit next to me” so i do that. we are all talking and joking around we stayed like that for maybe an hour and got up to go home, the other 3 say “we’re gonna go this way” and my crush says “oh i gotta go this way” obviously i have to go the same way as her so we’re walking and she’s like “i gotta buy food for my cats” and i told her i’ll come with her so we talk the whole way about anything and everything and we left the store and the store is very close to the subway station and i look at her and go “are you gonna take the subway” she says yes and i told her i’m gonna walk she said “i’ll walk with you” so we start walking joking around laughing and our subway stations are relatively close to each other so we come to the other station and im like yh im gonna take this station and she’s like ok im gonna go home i love right here and she shows me her building and i was like ok, so to go to the station i had to cross the road im waiting for the light to turn green and she’s like “im gonna come with you” till the next light bc i have 2 roads to cross so she comes with me and im waiting for the second light to turn green and mind you we said our goodbyes and all she’s like fully leaving right before the light turns green she’s like “do you wanna come to my house?” i was like “HUH?” she repeated herself I SWEAR IT WAS LIKE IN THE MOVIES and obviously i said yes she was like “we can study for the exam plus my roommate is not gonna be home today” so we are going to her house we enter the apartment building and she’s opening her door and she told me “you are the first person to ever come to my house” i said that i was honoured we come in and she has 2 cats in kind of afraid of cats and i told her that before coming into the apartment she said don’t worry they don’t bite. i take my shoes off and sit down on the couch she goes i’ll go get the computer so we can study she goes to her room and get her computer and sits down on the couch next to me we study for like 20 mins AND I SWEAR I COULD CUT THE TENSION WITH A FUCKING KNIFE THE SILENCE WAS SO LOUD IF THERE WAS A MOMENT FOR A KISS IT WOULD BE THIS ONE. pour shoulders are touching and we kinda leaving on the couch and she looks at me and i look away and im like “the apartment is very pretty” said asked me if i wanted a tour and i said yes so she showed me everything her roommates room had like a lot of kpop posters and then she showed me her room and it was really cosy and she is a kpop fan as well but she didn’t have any posters in her room so i said “you don’t have posters in your room” so she told me to come into the room and she closed the door and behind her door she had one poster and i was like “only the right people can see that you are a kpop stan” she said “yes only the choses ones when the door is closed” WHEN SHE SAID THAT I ALMOST FAINTED CAUSE WTF DOES RHAT MEAN!?!?!!. 

we went back to the living room and her cats were like roaming around me and i kinda started caressing them and she said “they are very comfortable around you it’s weird” and i said “does that mean something ?” she said idk and started blushing. so i got up to go home and she got up with me i went to the balcony window and her view was so pretty i was looking outside and she came next to me and her back was facing the outside IT WAS LIKE IN THE MOVIES ISTG NOW THAT I TALK ABOUT IT and we talked a little bit and i was like i gotta go so before i left she asked me what my favorite food was again bc at the bar we talked about it and she asked me again i told her the name and said “do you wanna make it for me?” she said “maybe one day”, she kept talking to me till i left the building from her door, i was living to get the bus and she texted me “don’t worry for the exam you’re gonna ace it” and all of that encouraging shit. 

that fucking exam is done and we went to eat lunch we decided to do so in our uni’s garden so we brought sandwiches and all and we sat down in the grass. she sat down next to me, my friend had one of those looong umbrellas you know with a pointy thing at the end and she was spinning it around i told her to stop bc she could hurt someone with it and it did fly out of her hand one time and my crush hid behind me back and like anytime she would spin it again would like squeeze my arm a little bit. 

another and our last  exam day comes and once again i leave first as i always do and im outside and she’s the next person that comes after me she comes near me and we talked about the exam and blah blah blah she goes to the vending machine to buy skittles and she asks me if i want anything i said no and she stared eating her skittles and i HATE SKITTLES she said to me “what do you like ? you have everything” i almost said YOU but i didn’t, she was eating those skittles so deliciously i wanted some so she game me a handful and i was like ew i don’t want the lemon and orange ones she said those are my favorite and i was like “do you know the olive theory?” she said she didn’t so i explained it to her “i said you like the orange and lemon ones and i hate them that means we are a great match and that we are compatible” she started smiling when i said that. all of our other friends came out and the thing with me is that i distance myself when i see them talking about the answers of the exam so that’s what i did she came right after me, anywhere i would go she would come after. 

SO I NEED TO KNOW WAS SHE INTO ME OR NO? ITS BEEN COUPLE OF MONTHS SINCE OUR LAST CONTACT AND I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS SITUATION. WAS I DELULU OR MAYBE THERE WAS SOMETHING I COUDLVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FNDNENDBDB ",1,1729430105.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Preview:
""I noticed your friend didn’t come in today.”

Aziraphale huffed. “Why would that be any concern of yours?”

“Because it matters to me if you’re unhappy. Why does that bother you so much?” Anathema arched an eyebrow at him.

He didn’t immediately reply, just kept clearing the table. He was grateful that she didn’t press him for an answer. His mood had gotten far darker than he’d realized until he started talking about it. Ridiculous, but there it was.

“I appreciate that you care, my dear,” he responded quietly. “I’m afraid I’m not in the best head space to talk about it.”

“Will we see him again in the shop?”

Aziraphale finally stopped cleaning. Is that what he was worried about? That Crowley wouldn’t come back? He hadn’t canceled their plans for Saturday evening, yet. “I’m sure we will. Just not today, clearly.” Aziraphale struggled to keep the emotion out of his voice. Mercifully, Anathema let the matter drop, for the moment.

The needling of his conscience returned. He was treating Anathema as poorly as he had treated Crowley, he realized. He was so afraid of his own need for connection that he was keeping all his friends at arm's length. Instead of sitting down and eating with Crowley, he'd found excuses to be busy and ignored him. Instead of acknowledging Anathema's genuine concern, he was pushing her away. Aziraphale was nearly in tears as he turned to Anathema while they were locking up the shop that night. “My dear, would you like to come upstairs for a glass of wine? I feel the need to redeem myself for earlier.”

1g7yb5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1g7yb5i/jstracetoix_debugging_react_vue_and_nodejs_just/,"JsTraceToIX - Debugging React, Vue, and Node.js just got easier! – no need to clutter your codebase with `console.log`!","If you've ever had to debug React or Vue components, arrow functions, or complex expressions on Node or the Web Browser, you know the pain of adding multiple `console.log` statements and making unnecessary code changes. That's where **JsTraceToIX** comes in!  
And in the case of React or Vue templates, if you need to debug the expressions, it will visually alter your design, making too messy to read anything.

[JsTraceToIX](https://github.com/a-bentofreire/jstracetoix) is an expression tracer for debugging React or Vue components, arrow functions, method chaining, and expressions in general.

Code editors typically cannot set breakpoints within such expressions, requiring significant code changes to debug.

JsTraceToIX provides a straightforward solution to this problem.

It was designed to be simple, with easily identifiable functions that can be removed once the bug is found.

JsTraceToIX has 2 major functions:

* `c__` capture the input of an expression input. ex: `c__(x)`
* `d__` display the result of an expression and all the captured inputs. ex: `d__(c__(x) + c__(y))`

And 2 optional functions:

* `init__` initializes display format, output stream and multithreading.
* `t__` defines a name for the current thread.

# Features

* No external dependencies.
* Runs on Node.js, browsers, React components, and Vue components.
* Minimalist function names that are simple and short.
* Traces Results along with Inputs.
* Configurable Result and Input naming.
* Outputs to console.debug on browsers, React and Vue, and to a stream on Node.js.
* Supports multiple levels.
* Capture Input method with customizable `allow` and `name` callbacks.
* Display Result method with customizable `allow`, `before`, and `after` callbacks.
* Result and Inputs can be reformatted and overridden.
* Configurable formatting at both global and function levels.
* Supports Multithreading.

# Python Version

This package is also available in Python for similar debugging purposes. The Python version, called **PyTraceToIX**, allows tracing input and output values during debugging and can be found on [PyTraceToIX](https://www.devtoix.com/en/projects/pytracetoix).

It offers the same `c__` and `d__` tracing functionality for Python, providing a seamless debugging experience across both languages.

# Installation

|Environment|Require Installation|
|:-|:-|
|Browser|No|
|Node.js|Yes|
|React|Optional|
|Vue|Yes|

    npm install jstracetoix --save-dev

# React Usage

In this example:

* `cityTax` arrow function captures the input price and names it 'Price'.
* On `ShoppingList` function:
   * `c__` captures the title in the first `<td>`.
   * `c__` captures the output of the cityTax and names it `CityTax` in the 2nd `<td>`.
   * `d__` displays the aggregated information in a single line: title, price, cityTax, total Price.

The `d__` will generate this output:

  
`i0:\`Rice\` | Price:\`10\` | CityTax:\`5\` | _:\`15\``  
`i0:\`Coffee\` | Price:\`30\` | CityTax:\`15\` | _:\`45\``  
`i0:\`Shoes\` | Price:\`100\` | CityTax:\`15\` | _:\`115\``  
  
  
React file

    import './App.css';
    // Without local installation
    import { c__, d__ } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/a-bentofreire/jstracetoix@1.1.0/component/jstracetoix.mjs';
    
    // If it's installed locally via ""npm install jstracetoix --save-dev""
    // import { c__, d__ } from 'jstracetoix/component/jstracetoix.mjs';
    
    const cityTax = (price) => c__(price, {name: 'Price'}) > 20 ? 15 : 5;
    const products = [
        { title: 'Rice', price: 10, id: 1 },
        { title: 'Coffee', price: 30, id: 2 },
        { title: 'Shoes', price: 100, id: 3 },
    ];
    
    function ShoppingList() {
        const listItems = products.map(product =>
            <tr key={product.id}>
                <td>{c__(product.title)}</td>
                <td>{d__(product.price + c__(cityTax(product.price), { name: 'CityTax' }))}</td>
            </tr>
        );
    
        return (
            <table><tbody>{listItems}</tbody></table>
        );
    }
    
    function App() {
        return (
            <div className=""App"">
                <header className=""App-header"">
                    <ShoppingList />
                </header>
            </div>
        );
    }
    
    export default App;

# Browser Usage

This example is similar to the React example, but instead the products are collected from a remote JSON.

* `c__` captures the price and the tax, and names `tax` the 2nd input.
* `d__` displays the aggregate information if `tax` is 0.15.

First, my concern is how to avoid being cheated by employees, especially when it comes to money. I have a solid background in inventory, so my plan is to inventory everything and serve food in portions. The orders of alcohol will also be tracked down to the last drop (Is this too much?).

Second, for those with KTV businesses, what problems do you usually encounter that I should be aware of or think of solutions for?

Third, can you give me tips on how to strengthen and attract more customers? Our target market is the working class, like jeepney and tricycle drivers.

Fourth, how would you handle employees who are messy or have a hard time following instructions? I don't want to be misinterpreted.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

The Roman goddess Fortune hands out good gifts and for no reason whatsoever and suddenly, this bitch snatches them right back whenever she feels like it. 

The momo doctrine that you must EARN blessings and EARN salvation is total horseshit. 

Worse, it’s toxic. 

It fucked me up for 58 years. 

For the believers: 

Jesus said his father made both the sun (good fortune) and the rain (bad luck) to shine and fall on everyone. 

He also said he wouldn’t lose a single soul. 

No, blessings and salvation aren’t just for those who pay him 10%, avoid coffee, and wear special underwear. 

Since extracting myself from the cult, and especially since formally resigning, I have blossomed.

Just wanted to provide an update in case anyone was interested in how the Bambino performed in an event setting.

Tl;dr (luckily) we survived. The bambino put in OT.

We ended up not finding a loaner machine. An I did make a few gallons of drip coffee.

Over 8 hrs we made 90 espresso drinks, and about 50 coffee drinks. Actual pull count was closer to 150, as iced drinks have 2 pulls in them. Everyone was happy and nobody waited too long.

The major issue was not being able to use the steam wand at the same time it's pulling a shot. Fortunately, most people ordered iced lattes. If people had been ordering hot drinks, we absolutely would have been hosed.

The shop was packed all day, but the spacing or drink orders worked for us--the most drinks waiting at one time was 6.

So overall, we're really happy we didn't not have espresso drinks--the exposure for our recipes and our supplier's beans was invaluable. The bambino did better than expected. But we got lucky with a lot of factors, and will upgrade in a few months. I'm also glad we prepped iced coffee like the sub recommended. If any Breville reps are lurking around, we'd be happy to provide testimonial in exchange for a larger machine.",3,1729429223.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

They took up this huge table meant for about 8 people, spreading their stuff everywhere. It got me thinking – is this a common thing? I get that students need a place to study, but taking up that much space and buying next to nothing feels a bit inconsiderate, especially when the café was busy.

So after this I told guy I am sorry but that he should not provoke anybody but yeah he told he won't, and that we were both ""retards"" (HE TOLD THIS DON'T THINK I TOLD THIS), so we got to be friends and yeah this sounds good for now. So my friend has girlfriend (he is the only guy with girlfriend in my friend group) so he sometimes makes joke like I am going to marry you guys won't! It doesn't provoke anybody but if it does he or us stop using that joke! So the kid from the first story we are going to call him Mike! (It's not his name I live in Bosnia).

So hi, the guy we call Mike after this became our friend (this happened few months ago) but a few weeks ago this all changed so I was going to caffee with my friend (OP) and my girlfriend we weren't joking because she doesn't like that type of jokes. And Mike joined us. So I got Coca Cola my friend (OP) doesn't like Sweet drinks so he got Sparkling Water and we all joked that he is grandpa! And Mike decided to put salt in my gf's drink and tell her he did that because she was in toilet. So we thought he did it in his drink because she and him got the same drink! So when she came OP went to the toilet (in our friend group we don't go in toilet while the other one is in it). So this is why I am typing and not OP! So she started drink her coffee! And started coughing because of salt in coffee! And he told her I did that, I was I didn't do that but because of our fight she tought I wanted to kick him out of the friend group! So my gf broke up with me because of that! So after this I left the caffee and OP went with me after this Mike started provoking us again and he decided to punch me and OP!

OP:  
So after this we both started running for him, and when my friend got him he punched him instead of me and when Mike tried to hit my friend I got infront of him and slapped him across the face and he started crying that I should not get into this so now me and my friend want to ask AWTJ",1,1729428992.0,AmITheJerk,0,1.0,False

If you haven’t heard of temu, it’s a shopping app that has every product under the sun for crazy low prices. They offer free shipping and they are similar the shein or aliexpress.

Temu has tons of games that get you free items (no referrals needed for games like farmland/fishland/coffee tree), and all you have to do is log in each day and do a couple quick tasks (like feed your fish).

Please consider helping, temu links aren’t allowed on reddit, so if you’re interested, send me a chat and I’ll give you the link. 

So if I sound spammy, I always tell people this- Temu is legit if you try. If you feed your fish enough, they WILL send you items. Problem is people expect free stuff in like.. their first two days, and when that doesn’t happen, it must be a scam. It takes time, but it’s fun and it’s legit.

After spending years in my comfort zone, avoiding social interactions and sticking to the occasional hangout with childhood friends, I decided to stop making excuses, like saying ""people are draining"", and put myself out there.

Since I'm not at university or similar, I had to find other ways to meet new people, so I joined a few groups on Meetup.

I was secretly terrified of walking into a room full of strangers and starting conversations, but I did it anyway because the pain of staying lonely and comfortable had become worse than the discomfort of taking action.

The first event was held in a loud, dark venue packed with people. It felt impossible to fit in without awkwardly interrupting a conversation. Honestly, it was rough. Before walking through the door, I almost turned around, but I pushed myself to go just to prove I could do it.

I ordered a drink and managed to hold a one-hour conversation with an interesting guy, but he left early because he couldn't stand the noise. I left too, feeling disappointed, as it wasn’t the smaller, friendlier group I was hoping for, but I was still glad I showed up.

On the way home, I felt envious of all the groups of friends and couples enjoying their night, while I was alone, walking home.

I had the urge to give up, thinking all my future social attempts would be just as bad. But instead, I said ""screw it"" and looked for another group on my phone as I walked.

I signed up to a book club to try something very different.

I almost didn’t go, thinking it wouldn’t be worth it. But I showed up last minute, and...

...woah! It was amazing!

A smaller, welcoming group of people from all walks of life. I had great conversations, and the discussion was very engaging, we had a shared interest and there was something to gain from the session even without the social aspect of it.

Afterwards, I noticed this stunning girl. I approached her, and we ended up having a two-hour conversation that was fun and fulfilling. I wanted to ask for her number but couldn't when a friend of hers showed up and they started talking. Didn't want to interrupt. At the last minute before she left, I asked, and she happily gave me her number without hesitation. Today, I will suggest grabbing coffee sometime next week. Maybe she’ll be interested, maybe not, that’s out of my control. I'm happy knowing I did what I could and didn't chicken out.

Here’s what I learned:

1. \*\*Show up\*\*: You never know how close you are to meeting your people or someone interesting. Even if it doesn’t go well, you’re practicing for when the right opportunity comes.
2. \*\*Make a move\*\*: Don’t be afraid to approach someone. You’ve got nothing to lose. You probably won't remember it in a few weeks or a year, even if it was awkward. But you have a lot to gain. We regret the things we don’t do, so we do more things.
3. \*\*Redefine success\*\*: Success isn’t about making a new friend, landing a date, or finding a group you click with, that’s beyond your control. Success is in the things you \*can\* control: showing up, being kind, approaching someone, asking for that number, or aiming to make people feel good. How others respond is up to them. If you’ve done your best, let yourself feel good about it, even if you get ghosted or rejected after it. It's not personal, keep going. Please.",4,1729428792.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

I was picked up and dropped off and did not attempt to start or drive my vehicle. I woke up Saturday morning, had coffee with my dad and hungout for about 2 hours then decided to go to KFC to get something to eat. I failed the first test and waited a little bit to try again and I passed. As I’m driving to KFC, I beeps for me to do a random retest. I do the random retest, and it fails. I did not consume any alcohol that morning. So I pull over and wait then I start my car and pass every test/retest after that but it says “violation lockout 2 service required 4 days” I called intoxalock and i have to take it in on Monday. I’m still able to start and drive my car. But being that I’m no longer in probation, I’m wondering what could possibly happen? Thank you",2,1729428770.0,intoxalock,0,1.0,False
1g7xzbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g7xzbq/please_just_keep_showing_up/,"Please, just keep showing up.","I'm a 24M from Germany. After spending years in my comfort zone, avoiding social interactions and sticking to the occasional hangout with childhood friends, I decided to stop making excuses, like saying ""people are draining"", and put myself out there.

Since I'm not at university or similar, I had to find other ways to meet new people, so I joined a few groups on Meetup.

I was secretly terrified of walking into a room full of strangers and starting conversations, but I did it anyway because the pain of staying lonely and comfortable had become worse than the discomfort of taking action.

The first event was held in a loud, dark venue packed with people. It felt impossible to fit in without awkwardly interrupting a conversation. Honestly, it was rough. Before walking through the door, I almost turned around, but I pushed myself to go just to prove I could do it.

I ordered a drink and managed to hold a one-hour conversation with an interesting guy, but he left early because he couldn't stand the noise. I left too, feeling disappointed, as it wasn’t the smaller, friendlier group I was hoping for, but I was still glad I showed up.

On the way home, I felt envious of all the groups of friends and couples enjoying their night, while I was alone, walking home.

I had the urge to give up, thinking all my future social attempts would be just as bad. But instead, I said ""screw it"" and looked for another group on my phone as I walked.

I signed up to a book club to try something very different.

I almost didn’t go, thinking it wouldn’t be worth it. But I showed up last minute, and...

...woah! It was amazing!

A smaller, welcoming group of people from all walks of life. I had great conversations, and the discussion was very engaging, we had a shared interest and there was something to gain from the session even without the social aspect of it.

Afterwards, I noticed this stunning girl. I approached her, and we ended up having a two-hour conversation that was fun and fulfilling. I wanted to ask for her number but couldn't when a friend of hers showed up and they started talking. Didn't want to interrupt. At the last minute before she left, I asked, and she happily gave me her number without hesitation. Today, I will suggest grabbing coffee sometime next week. Maybe she’ll be interested, maybe not, that’s out of my control. I'm happy knowing I did what I could and didn't chicken out.

Here’s what I learned:

1. \*\*Show up\*\*: You never know how close you are to meeting your people or someone interesting. Even if it doesn’t go well, you’re practicing for when the right opportunity comes.
2. \*\*Make a move\*\*: Don’t be afraid to approach someone. You’ve got nothing to lose. You probably won't remember it in a few weeks or a year, even if it was awkward. But you have a lot to gain. We regret the things we don’t do, so we do more things.
3. \*\*Redefine success\*\*: Success isn’t about making a new friend, landing a date, or finding a group you click with, that’s beyond your control. Success is in the things you \*can\* control: showing up, being kind, approaching someone, asking for that number, or aiming to make people feel good. How others respond is up to them. If you’ve done your best, let yourself feel good about it, even if you get ghosted or rejected after it. It's not personal, keep going. Please.",1,1729428686.0,dating,1,1.0,False

1g7xwbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1g7xwbp/advice_for_a_really_tired_mom/,Advice for a really tired mom ,"I have 2 amazing boys (8&4) that I love so much, but right now I am at a loss with how to help my youngest. Any advice is greatly appreciated! 

My oldest is very polite, does well in school, has tons of friends, loves helping me, and generally a very good listener and ALWAYS has been all of these things. I very rarely have to get on to him for anything and IF I do, he quickly fixes his behavior and we’re all good. 

My youngest is the complete opposite. Now yes, I understand he’s 4 so I am much more patient with him. But this is starting to get so exhausting to the point me and my husband are baffled as to how to help him and teach him. If he doesn’t get his way, 9/10 there is going to be hell to pay. He is destructive and violent. Throwing his iPad, knocking over drinks, kicking tables, hours long crying sessions. This is usually a daily occurrence. He’s slapped my husband and me in the face in public and at home so many times I can’t even count. For absolutely no reason he will walk up to his brother and slap his arm or leg for….I guess simply existing? 

I am terrified to even leave the house with him because he WILL NOT listen. If I say “don’t run across the parking lot, stay beside me and hold my hand” he’s sprinting across the parking lot. Simple things like listening to a song in the car are totally off limits. If he doesn’t like the song we can’t listen to it. I bought a 1 pound bag of skittles and told him I would put some in a bowl, but he couldn’t have the whole bag. 2 solid hours of crying, kicking, screaming. 

I can not turn my back for a second or I risk the chances of an entire room being destroyed. I was cooking dinner a few days ago and all the sudden I start smelling baby soap. I go investigate and half a bottle of baby soap is being poured all over the floor in our hall way. It took FOREVER to clean. He will throw food onto the floor if he doesn’t like it. He will grab crackers and squish them in his hands and throw the crumbs on the floor. It’s hard for us to even play with him because if we don’t play EXACTLY how he wants us to, he will pick up his toys and start throwing them across the room. 

No amount of talking to him and explaining why we can’t do these things works. Time out in his room? No chance, he throws himself at the door or simply opens it and walks right out. Doesn’t matter how many times we take him back kicking and screaming. Taking his iPad? Doesn’t care. He barely watches it anyway, so taking it really isn’t a punishment. Taking away treats or toys like “no ice cream after dinner if you keep hitting or doing XYZ” he doesn’t care, he will continue to do whatever he wants to do. 

I am scared he’s going to actually hurt himself one day because he will not listen. A good example of this is over the summer he had a pretty bad rash from his life jacket. My husband told him he could take it off for just a minute to eat his sandwich on our boat, but he HAD to put it back on after (we were docked on a shallow sandbar) My husband sat with him and ate lunch while I played in the lake with my oldest. In the time it took my husband to grab a drink from the cooler my son had jumped off the back of our boat into at least 8 foot deep water. Thankfully we have been working with him on swimming but NEVER in a lake, only our pool. I went home and cried because all I could think was “what if he had sunk? What if my son drowned 5 feet away from me because I couldn’t see him?” 

I just don’t know what to do. My oldest son was so easy. All of my friend’s children are very well behaved so they have no advice to give me. Every morning I wake up I drink my coffee knowing the second my youngest wakes up it’s going to be an adventure. Because the minute he walks into the main area he’s going to be demanding to watch tv, screaming at me to get him a blanket, screaming at me to make him food, I am going to make the “WRONG THING” even though I made WHAT HE ASKED FOR and he’s going to throw it in the floor. I was terrified for him to start school. I anticipated the school calling me or messaging me on a regular basis. His teachers say he is very well behaved and has lots of friends. When he stays with his grandparents they all tell me how sweet and funny he is. It hurts to know that I wait on him hand and foot and love him so much, but he treats me and his dad so different from everyone else.

1g7xvgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/masteringselfconcept/comments/1g7xvgc/why_some_things_are_easier_than_others/,Why some things are easier than others,"We hear a lot how manifesting is as easy as ordering a cup of coffee ☕️.  But what if you had trauma around cups of coffee? What if you were worried it was going to reject you and tell you not to drink it? Would it be easy then? 

I know this is an extreme example, or course a cup of coffee isn’t going to reject you 😂.  What I’m saying is that manifesting within areas of your life where there is no trauma is naturally going to be easier as you will have less resistance to it.  When I manifested my house, this was super easy for me as I don’t have trauma around moving house.  But when it came to my relationship I really struggled and I think a lot of us do.  

We develop our attachment styles in relationships from a very early age as a survival mechanism.  This means that in your adult life it’s subconscious and you may not necessarily be aware of how you are protecting yourself from painful feelings and negative expectations.  So when we try to manifest our dream relationships we can fall into feeling disheartened, feeling like we aren’t good enough and doubting whether it’s even possible for us.  But this is a trauma response.

When you can first become aware of your patterns in relationships, you can see where you are holding yourself back.  Maybe your fear of abandonment forces you to become either clingy or completely avoidant so that you sabotage relationships.  Maybe you grew up in a chaotic household so stability feels boring to you, or that you start conflict as a way to bring more ‘passion’ into the relationship.  Be brutally honest with yourself around how you are impacting your relationships based off ideas and beliefs that you adopted in childhood.  Maybe you believe that the perfect person wouldn’t argue with you? Maybe you have unrealistic expectations of your desired partner.  

So you can see how manifesting is not always simple and easy.  For me it certainly wasn’t and I had a lot of healing to do.  Don’t think that just because it’s hard for you that it shouldn’t be this way.  Everything is always perfect even when it doesn’t look like it.",2,1729428338.0,masteringselfconcept,0,1.0,False

Last night he came to bed pretty late almost 1130pm (he had a friend over) I know he wanted to have sex but I just wasn't feeling it.

I cuddle up on him and I fell asleep pretty fast laster on around 2am I woke up cause my arm was sore from laying on ot so I move, and he wakes up too and in a really bad mood talking under his breath, sighing loudly, touching me like a tickle on the neck but  aggressively.

like you know like his trying to show his really annoyed.

This goes on for quite awhile so he then says are we okay I don't seem like we are ok he said he was pissed cause he wanted to cuddle all day and he was trying to give me kisses and hugs throughout the day ect shit like that.

 i'm like we good I just want to sleep so  mind you I gave him attention today and I fell asleep cuddling him, we just didn't have sex.

so i put my headphones on to ignore him but my anxiety was so bad at that point it took me a really long time to fall asleep.

this morning he woke me up with a kiss and him and his friend are going to get coffee. He came back gave me a coffee and kiss said he didn't sleep at all last night.

Note: I usually feel pressured into having sex everyday because if we don't he gets chanky.

We been together almost 3 years now and the attitude he gives me when he doesn't get what he wants is starting to really get to me, I feel like I'm constantly walking on egg shells.

How do I tell him this is starting to become an issue and he needs to stop it?

If you haven’t heard of temu, it’s a shopping app that has every product under the sun for crazy low prices. They offer free shipping and they are similar the shein or aliexpress.

Temu has tons of games that get you free items (no referrals needed for games like farmland/fishland/coffee tree), and all you have to do is log in each day and do a couple quick tasks (like feed your fish).

Please consider helping, temu links aren’t allowed on reddit, so if you’re interested, send me a chat and I’ll give you the link. 

So if I sound spammy, I always tell people this- Temu is legit if you try. If you feed your fish enough, they WILL send you items. Problem is people expect free stuff in like.. their first two days, and when that doesn’t happen, it must be a scam. It takes time, but it’s fun and it’s legit.

1g7xr6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/GregDoucette/comments/1g7xr6z/i_think_if_i_could_ever_gain_enough_weight_i/,"I think if I could ever gain enough weight, I would turn into a real monster.","I just watched Gregs video. That one, you know, probably the one with talking about Mike. That's the one, with it showing his training, Greg talked about. 

I've had this happen to me before that I don't know how strong I am compared to other people or what my training would look like to them. 

Everyone thinks that being 124.75lbs that it must mean I must be weak or don't even know how to work out. 9% bf, that 9% besides maybe 2lb is in my muscle. Diet aside, though. Diet is a separate issue, I can't manage to gain weight even when I am intaking is over 3500k a day, not including about 100k for every drink 8-9 drinks. I don't have the money for some super mass gainer, if you put that in front of me, it's like a 50$ tub, only 10 day supply the big tubs, and I would die attempting to consuming that in all in one sitting, not really, but it would be just gone, you don't understand the lengths I've gone to to gain weight. Like, dude, that's not enough, you have to eat more than that, apparently you don't understand, nigga, I understand that I'm 124.75lbs and consume 4000k a day give or take, and I still don't weigh even as much as a typical male.

I do just happen to be really strong for my weight, was strong before I stopped working out 11 years ago. I had 10 years of exercise experience, 5 bodyweight, 5 weight training. 

I realized I couldn't gain that much muscle, so I went for strength. Before I quit, I made it to being overall strongest and most athletic of my high school. I made it my point to be. Yeah, people were stronger in my school, but it wasn't that anyone was stronger than me one person more than me on everything, except that one dude on steroids. 

So, here's some examples. I didn't know how strong I was on jammer press machine, a real jammer press, until I went asking around the football teams what they used. I dropped athletics, I had to make up classes for switching schools, and luckily I had an option that once I finished them early I chose another P.E. class. Why? Well, luckily, again, I had couches who let me use the weightroom all to myself the whole period. I had been training a full year straight going 45-1hr 30min 5 days a week. That's not all I did, btw.

But, that's why I didn't know that using 265lb just the levers using my arms was apparently a lot. So, that and watching Greg. ....now I'm wondering if, would it have been my training also a lot for someone else. If you asked me, I think it would be, because I tell you, I couldn't guage the fitness level of an absolute beginner even to safe my life right now. But, that's why I want to find out from you all here. 

Have any of you ever trained at level 4? I couldn't do it, I mean, I could, but what would that look like? You're about to find out why that for me if I even attempted it, there seriously wouldn't be any coming back. So all this you're about to hear is still from just level 3. 

For reference, I don't know all what my stats were, but here's what I could say. 

I could curl the 65's, lateral raise the 35's, max jammer press 265lbs, max peck machine 285lbs maxed out, I think 26 pullups straight, chinnup hold 13min, first dozen attempting ever to deadlift 265lbs, did ..not... exclusively train legs was just way more athletic, ran 40m in 5.0, bench couldn't do no spotter plus I stopped at 150lb, if jammer press won't count towards incline bench my incline I stopped at 165lb, ..that was after starting at incline at 45lb 5 months earlier in 9th grade, squat it's hard to say barbell squat I stopped at I think I was pushing 185lb also in 9th grade, I think my leg press when I stopped was at 265lb or pushed around 300lb, my lat pulldown was 180lb, I couldn't go any higher, since it would literally rip me off the pad lol, I managed to handle a max of I think 475 pushups a day by the time I was in 8th grade, I never tested that before I quit, all I know is  the only time I ever tested my straight pushups not broken into sets it was 132 full pushups 116 hall pushups, and I couldn't even count the real number of sittups I could do, the pain being skinny on my tailbone made me top out at around 450, but I could do that multiple times a day. 

Aside from any of my max stats. Here's what I did in my freetime. Come home, continue to work out for hours on end. If I had not been working out for hours on a given day, I was either roaming around swinging, smashing, and breaking things in wooded areas with a 10lb pole until the sun goes down did it for 7 years or I was walking/cycling anywhere within a 10mi diameter of home on a daily basis. And guess what else, then it came nightfall and every other night I was cycling 4mi there and back to my girlfriend's house to spend doing you guess what 6 hours there. 

My workout routine.. oh... hold on, wait.. I didn't also mention, at those workout sessions at school I was working all of my muscle groups in those sessions at a time, I mean 5 sets each 8 reps minimum, not a lot you can do in only 45min, some days half the sets, but always my full body. So... home routine, bulk of my total weekly volume consisted of mainly light weight training, but a lot. I had this spreedsheet, covered in exercises, let me go ahead and say this, 8hrs to complete, 90 reps 3 sets, do the whole routine 3 times. I had bodyweight, 10, 15lb plates, 10lb weight straps, 30lb barbell of coffee cans with cement, a tower 200 (each corner made 50lb) on my door of residence bands, a power tower I had another set of residence bands to just strap to my legs for, and a pair of 25lbs dumbbells. I'm telling you I worked out for hours, I couldn't maintain doing the whole routine for more than a weekat a time, though. Is that a lot? 

Even now, here's 11 years later, I have to stay in a gym 5 hours at a time just to know I had a good workout. I have the endurance to other people's whole entire weekly routines. My lung capacity is shit, right now, though, if I can handle it, I just still have the endurance to do it. But, I didn't get to mention this yet, interesting things start to happen when I lessen the weight. If I pick up any amount of weight, like not doing a full workout, I'm still doing 32, 18, 13 reps, I don't care what it is. I didn't have a hard limit on any of my max's, I mean, my 1rm was my 3rm, I could literally use the full force of my muscles available to me more than once. That's why doing 5 hard sets with 8 reps, using a working weight of about 235lb for jammer press and 255lb for peck machine was my normal level 3 intensity. I could deadlift that my max, each of those 12 attempts at doing deadlift was 3 reps each up to 265lbs 3 times. 

Why am I like this? Rhetorical question. I have a few theories of my own, but might one attributed factor, I have an abnormally fast heartrate. Now when I tell you abnormal. It would rest at 120bpm to 132bpm, the highest I ever made it go was at 285bpm. I've seen specialists about it, wore heart monitors, everything. Don't even ask me to go to an er, because if I stood up, the buzzer and alarm would go off on their machines. ...high. all anyone could tell me was it was like a racecar, it was built to go fast. 

If I were to gain weight and go back to my usual strength and endurance, with that level of strength just with more mass, strength adjusted accordingly to my weight, I would be a monster. What would you think? 

*something I don't really have to add. My arms are 13in. My quads are thick from the side, but not going to lie they're shit at only 22.5in. My calfs on the other hand, imagine 124.75lbs, and having one calf 17.5in and the other one 19.5in. I got some buff fucking calfs lol. ",0,1729427944.0,GregDoucette,19,0.43,False

We met last Friday for our first date, it was a coffee and walking around my city date (around 3 hours long) and it went well. We didn't kiss at the end. 

We immediately set a date for Wednesday, I went to his city this time and he showed me around. I went to his place, we watched a movie, cuddled and had our first kiss. I'd told him then that I didn't want to do more than kiss, and he said he didn't intend to ask me for more than that anyway. I was with him around 6 hours.

We tried to set a third date, but our schedules didn't align for two weeks. So, on Friday night (one week after our first meeting) he told me he'd cancelled plans with his friend so he could come see me. He came pretty late so we just spent it at my place. We watched movies, ordered some food, and this time we made out. It was around 6 hours again. 

After the date, I felt anxious about the pace because I tend to get attached quickly. I sent him a message saying I wanted to set a boundary, then told him I'm reaching the level of what I can do just casually. I said I don't want to rush anything, but I want to be clear I have no intention of ever being in a situationship-type arrangement. 

Was that too intense? I felt I couldn't meet him again without letting him know what my intentions are, mainly to protect myself from getting hurt later on if he's looking for a casual arrangement, but I'm worried I may have scared him away. It has only been just over a week, I also want to just continue to get to know him but I also wanted to have boundaries. Did I say it too early? He isn't the fastest replier to my texts so I've just been anxiously waiting. ",2,1729427895.0,dating,3,1.0,False

Summary is i had used Nexito Plus (Escitalopram + Clonazepam) and it brought me out of this anxiety induced gastritis accompanied by excessive belching and other issues related to imbalance and feelings of regurgitation/sensation of Globus in my throat.

Well, i am happy to share that i am now able to consume food that used to be triggers in much more quantities than i thought i could. Now i have coffee literally 4 times day, i have had chocolates the entire week and indulged in ice creams as well. I do plan to get back to a normal diet and not intentionally go for the trigger foods and that too in a binge. 

I am not really sure of the reasons since i have tried numerous things and anecdotally i will share what i feel yielded results for me. The SSRI did help me after a bad flareup but i only took it for 10 days. Once my acid reflux subsided, i took Aloe vera in the morning, i took Psyllium fiber multiple times during the day usually in between meals when i felt some acidity and experienced belching. I also had the habit of keeping a piece of Cloves in my mouth without chewing it for hours. It would produce saliva that i would ingest and provide sort of relief from belching and acidity. I also started taking lactase tablets with coffee (not black but with milk). I feel one or many of these things have helped me so much in recent times that i feel (though not sure since it needs to persist) comfortable going back to trying out foods i used to be scared of and foods that have been big triggers like chocolate/coffee/sweets etc. My anxiety issues have also subsided and i no longer feel wobbly in the head nor do i experience any head pressure. One of the things that also happened recently is a big weight gain and i dont know if this is a factor too but i want to say that this whole acidity issue started only after i dropped my weight from 95 KG to 63KG using my own methods of abstaining from rice and cutting down on fatty foods etc. within a matter of 1 year. In the last three months, my weight has trended up due to my getting comfortable with food and is now currently at 73 KG.

I hope this post will be useful to others in this long tiresome and quite depressing journey. I have had this issue for past 4+ years and am really relieved and hopeful now that i can start to atleast enjoy in moderate amounts foods that i used to totally abstain from earlier. Whether i am healed or not totally, only time can tell but for now i have improved to a point where i can confidently share with all of you after many a struggle  that i have been through along with others here.

It's a classic matchup of ""Can the Dolphins actually score?"" versus ""Can the Colts' defense stop anyone?"" The Colts, sitting at a lukewarm 3-3, are favored by a field goal, which is about as exciting as a lukewarm cup of coffee. Meanwhile, the Dolphins are 2-3 and coming off a bye week, which means they've had plenty of time to figure out how to score more than 20 points—something they haven't done in a month. 

The Colts have Joe Flacco under center, who, at this point, is like a fine wine—aged, but not necessarily better. The Dolphins will counter with Tyler Huntley, who has thrown for a whopping zero touchdowns this season. Yes, you read that right, zero. But hey, at least he's consistent.

The Colts are 2-1 at home and unbeaten against the spread, which means they have a knack for keeping things interesting. The Dolphins, on the other hand, have covered the spread just once this season, making them about as reliable as a paper umbrella in a hurricane.

With the Colts' moneyline at -159 and the Dolphins at +135, the odds are slightly in favor of the Colts. But remember, underdogs win about 35% of the time in football, so there's a glimmer of hope for Miami. 

For those looking to make a bet, consider taking the Dolphins +3 at 1.89 odds. Given their strong defense and the Colts' third-worst defense in the league, Miami might just keep this one close enough to cover. And if you're feeling adventurous, sprinkle a little on the Dolphins' moneyline at +135.

This is sample of a project I've been working on for while. I would love to hear your honest feedback. My GF aranged a sit down with a proper editor as a b-day present and I would love to give them something cool. 



Chapter 1



“This journal will detail the stories, adventures and records by Deckhands, for Deckhands. Each entry MUST have: your name, the date, and whatever information you feel is worthy enough to make it into this holy document.”



This was my very first entry into my new Deckhand Journal: A Deckhand’s Tale of the Sea. Funnily enough, I broke two of the three rules I highlighted in the first paragraph of the original journal, so I will fill in the blanks where necessary. The first thing you need to know is, who is the person writing all of this. Theodore is my name however, I will be referred to by various nicknames. Some of those include Dumbass and Meatball, as well as a whole other host of names convenient for those working around me who don’t want to learn my name or pay me any kind of respect. 

	

The second piece of information missing is the date. Sadly, this is harder to pinpoint, however I can confirm that it was sometime soon before June 12th, 2018, as that is the date of the following journal entry (thank you, Kiara, for following the rules of the book - she will be an important character later on). 

	At the time of writing, I would have been 20 years old, and in my second year as a deckhand at the glorious company known as Murphy’s on the Water. At the start of this season I already have a year under my belt and I’m thinking this year is going to be my year! I’m taller, more handsome, and just finishing up a great year at university where I’m finally really getting girls and gaining some confidence. Watch out world!

	Unfortunately, I was still living with my parents as I was home for the summer, leaving my apartment in my university town. This bump in the road was not going to stop me from enjoying the summer ahead. 



Before we continue you should know a few things about me: I like to talk, I mean, love to talk, socialize, drink, have fun and enjoy life. I’m a relaxed, go-with-the-flow, type of guy. Nothing bothers me except when there’s a job to do. This is the only “type A” personality trait I have; when something needs to get done, and my reputation (and money) is on the line, it is going to get done. This is exactly why Murphy’s was the perfect summer job, especially for me. 

	It might be important to add a description of my appearance, since my adventures with the ladies are a key component to this story. If you can imagine the most ordinary, white college boy in the world, you wouldn’t be far off. I am 5’11” and between 150-160 pounds, not huge but also not a shrimp. I’m also not lying about my height (you assholes, I can feel your doubt through the pages!). I have standard brown hair which gets flowy when I let it grow out, and a very normal face with a set of hazel brown eyes under a pair of thick, dark eyebrows. Aside from the biggest smile you will ever see, the one feature of mine that stands out the most is the abundance of freckles, which are peppered all over every inch of my skin that manages to glimpse any sunlight. 



I’m your classic guy who is a jack of all trades, good enough to get by, but never good enough to show off. 

I am essentially perfectly average in every aspect - besides my stunning personality, which undoubtedly has already been conveyed. My personality is what carries me over the line. Most of it is due to my crazy upbringing in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The Darkside, the Dirty D, whatever you want to call it. For anyone who doesn’t know the area you can do you research, but who cares what they say. I love it here. 



People here have more character than your average bear. You need it to live and survive here, as we can’t really do all the fancy things those fakes do on the other side of the harbour, in Halifax. You need to have something going for you on this side of town. If you’re not funny, you might as well get outta town. Dartmouth, for those who don’t know, is the gritty, suburban, and less glamorous side of the Halifax Harbour. It’s a place where your street smarts, quick wit and jokes are a must if you want to survive here. This is what allows me to glide through the ups and downs of life, where otherwise people are beaten down. These are all reasons why Dartmouth is a great city, and there’s no place I’d rather be.



A question you might be asking yourself is Where, and what, is Halifax and this Dartmouth you call the “Darkside”? Well readers, it might just be the single best city in Canada, in my not-so-humble opinion. Halifax, Nova Scotia is the largest city in the Atlantic region of Canada (and at one point way back in history, one of the largest cities in the entirety of Canada), it’s the capital of Nova Scotia. Halifax isn’t really thought about by the rest of Canada, aside from students who want to attend university here. This is what makes Halifax awesome, it’s a hidden gem. Not many people live here that don’t want to be here. If you didn’t want to be here, you would have already left for better work, and you would have  hated your life somewhere else. 



People love this place and it’s not hard to see why, it has everything you could ever need. It has a compact old downtown filled with history and unique buildings, sitting on a beautiful harbourfront that flows into the Atlantic Ocean. There are old yet cool buildings previously deemed rundown. These places are being reinvented by hipsters, who somehow make the best coffee, beer and patio furniture one could ever find.



To maybe give Halifax it’s final bump. It has the 2nd most bars per capita in Canada. Having 40 000+ university students in the city may have something to do with that. The population is simply pleasant, polite, and easygoing. The Harbour is everything here in this city, and this is coming from a person who believed this even before he started working on boats. You could argue my love for the Harbour is a chicken and egg type of deal. I would have never worked on the boats if I didn’t think the Harbour was as cool as I think it is. 



There are a few reasons why I think the Harbour is crucial to the greatness of this city. First of all, the winters are not nearly as bad as most places in Canada, as the water prevents it from getting out-of-this-world cold, in the way most people associate with Canada. However, it creates very unpredictable weather. I have a theory that these weather 

patterns (or lack thereof), make people more apt to roll with the punches when life is unpredictable. 





These are the characteristics most locals have. And they were they were ones I had going into my first year at Murphy’s, although it was severely tested with all the nonsense this job throws at you. 



Now that all you really readers are familiar with the area. It’s time for that final piece of the puzzle. How did I find myself in this crazy place called Murphy’s? I ended up at Murphy’s the same way I seem to find myself in almost every situation in my life, by sheer coincidence. 



This time the coincidence was Eve. Fucking cousin Eve, the cousin who helped me choose which university I would be attending for the next four years of my life. She sold me on the parties, the food and the thing I cared least about, my degree. Credit to her recommendation , I had a spectacular first year so far. I was almost finished and about to pass every class. Her last piece of advice was to apply for this tourism company called Murphy’s.





At an Easter dinner she told me that I fit the bill of a classic Murphy’s deckhand. Whatever the fuck that meant. She told me to apply online as soon as possible as there was a job fair coming up and I would no doubt get a job for the summer. She wasn’t selling well enough so I decided to disregard her suggestion. I wanted to work as a server or bartender, all my buddies were doing this. This is where I thought the big bucks were made doing those roles in a restaurant. So I took half of her suggestion. I applied first for this Murphy’s place as a server, then as a back up I applied as a deckhand.





For those who don’t know Murphy’s is a combination of gift shop kiosks, a massive restaurant on the longest pier in the harbour, called the Cable Wharf, and last, but certainly not least, it owns wide variety of tour boats. The kiosks are corny, cheap,and touristy. If you read the yelp reviews the restaurant is “amazing”. In my opinion the food was average at best but that didn’t stop the tourists from flocking and being disappointed when they left. 



Thankfully, there the boats on premise to save the day. There were five different boats, and a handful of harbour hoppers, which were amphibious vehicles that operated both on land and in the harbour. These were the crowned jewels of the company they made hand over fist. But god damn were they boring. The people, the tours and the employees were fucking sandpaper.



The real fucking boats proceed as follows: The Harbour Queen, a beautiful Mississippi-style sternwheeler; the Kawartha Spirit, an all white, whale watching double decker; the Peggy’s Cove Express, a speedy fishing boat; Theodore the Tugboat, almost as if Thomas the Tank Engine was a tugboat instead of a locomotive with red colouring instead of blue; and the Tall Ship Silva, a massive three-masted schooner. They are the crowned jewels of this fantastically horrible place.



Now readers, I did tell you at the start that I would be frank with you, and tell the story responsibly, so I must admit…. I lied. The boats aren’t that great, realistically they’re falling apart and their tours are encompassed in deception. In my first year, the Kawartha’s engines blew up and its whale watch tour saw so few whales Murphy’s had to rebrand it as a “nature tour”; the Harbour Queen is commonly known as the Harbour Slut in Halifax because of all the raunchy late-night parties thrown on it; the Peggy’s Cove Express is so old it can no longer make it to Peggy’s Cove; and the Tall Ship Silva is not a real tall ship. It is technically a sailboat, although the way the sails are rigged, it cannot genuinely sail. Theodore the Tugboat is the only boat that does not deceive the public, but it’s geared towards kids so who cares. Hopefully, all this irony already exhibited in the boats will help foreshadow the wonderfully ridiculous nature that embodies the core of Murphy’s on the water. 



The one saving grace is that the boat staff are much more isolated than any other department in the company. This separation creates just enough of a disconnect so that everything that could go wrong will go wrong, almost all of the time. It also allows for more fun to be had, as the corporate heads of the company cannot mould all of the crew to fit into their perfect cookie cutter employee displayed on the travel brochures. There is also the additional contrast of the people who work on these boats; they are either supreme neat freaks or outright slobs in every aspect of work, life, and social settings. It is in this sort of chaos that I thrive.



Second, the water makes people want to have fun. It provides a location for activities you otherwise wouldn’t have if you lived in another city. Halifax is on the coast, with plenty of access to beaches where you can go swimming, surfing, and sailing. Most people around here like this sort of stuff.



After Eve, told me all this great information I did a little research. I discovered that the company would be holding a massive job fair in March, leading up to the season start in May. The instructions were simple: bring a resume, and for some reason prepare two stories; one of Halifax’s history, from which they selected a number of topics, and one of your choosing. The need to prepare a couple stories seemed strange to me, but I was unaware of what the job had in store regarding responsibilities. All the same, I began to prepare. 



My mom came and picked me up from university, and for the whole two hour car ride home, all we did was practice telling stories so I was prepared to crush this interview. I was definitely going to get this job. I wanted it desperately because one of my best friends, Jaggar, who attends the same university I do, was gunning for the same position. 

Jaggar is bananas, as he is an absolutely crazy, larger than life human, standing at 6’4”. With a booming voice and huge personality, he typically beats me to the punch on everything. If he were to get this job over me, I’d never hear the end of his crazy summer stories, being on the boats and talking to pretty girls. 

On the day of the job fair, we both arrive at the cold, wooden, unheated waterfront restaurant where they are conducting interviews. All of the managers of the various departments are sitting at tables with applicants for about 5-10 minutes, before the applicants move from table to table, talking to each of them. 

At this point I’m sweating it as I keep seeing good-looking people in their mid-20’s everywhere, and I’m this little, freshly 19 loser. Just as I’m getting this flash of self awareness and becoming nervous, my name is being called for my first interview, starting with a restaurant manager. Roxanne was her name, and the interview was a total bust. It was easy to see I had no idea what I was talking about, and I was quickly shooed away, only to hear my name being called by another person. 

This time it was a heavier set man, with dark hair half slicked back from his almost piggish face. Pierre was his name, and he was the manager of the boats and the captains. He was venting applications for the captains to “create good chemistry” on the boats - whatever the hell that meant. 

We sat at a small table that felt like it was about to break, the way Pierre was leaning on it. He began to ask general questions about my resume, but it was clear nautical questions were on the rise. So, as a man with zero knowledge of boats, I had one option - lie. 



Pierre called me over shortly and sat me down in a dark booth. He skipped every single pleasantries as if he had talked to 1000 guys my age. So I cut straight to the chase. I told him stories of sailing camps I never went to, knot tying I never did in scouts and the all the power boats my father wish he owned.

The stories were all fake, but my dad and brother both went to scouts so I bluffed the basics, and Christ almighty, it was working! Big manager Pierre was eating up what I was feeding him. Ten minutes passed and he told me to sit back down for a further interview. I’m pumped, but nervous, as the next interview might just start to expose all my well crafted lies. 

While I was waiting I googled names of knots, boats, nautical terms, you name it. I looked at everything I possibly could in five minutes. Like I said, I was not going to get turned down. In what seemed like two seconds since my last interview, my name gets called again, but by a different person.

Sitting at the back, in a booth, was a very tall, skinny, red haired man in a shirt that desperately needed to be tailored. The man in the booth is named Liam, and he will be a lurking character throughout my four years at Murphy’s. At every turn he was always constantly throwing wrenches into many of my plans. At the time, he was the manager of the deckhands, as well as some of the nautical operations in conjunction with Pierre.  

Liam took his turn asking the exact same beginner level nautical related questions Pierre asked during his interview. I gave him the same perfect  answer by lying right to his face. I told him I could tie many knots and knew the basics of sailing thanks to the same sailing camp I told Pierre about. Liam seemed very content with my answers. He never questioned a single explanation I gave and since there were no further questions from the two so called superiors I was free to leave.  After I left I felt as if I was a master of disguise. There was no way these guys believed me and my stories. I had to have given clues that I was full of shit and they must have sniffed it out. 



Regardless, it was worth a try. I had to go back to school to finish my first year of university. That was my first priority. They said I would know within a few weeks if I got it or not. I could find some summer job after my exams if I had too. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks and I got the email with the job offer, just as my final exams are ending. This is a huge weight off my shoulders. Jaggar received the same email and we were both thrilled to be potentially working together. We head home after school finishes and wait for a call to begin work, not knowing what we will be doing. 

It seems as though these calls will not be coming anytime soon, as day after day goes by without a word. In order to pass the time, Jaggar and I begin to gamble online, playing Blackjack in order to make just enough money to party with our friends, who have all started their jobs already. This was a terrible mistake, as we quickly started to burn through all of the money we had left from out first (and very expensive) year at university. Our bank account balances are getting very low, along with our morale, and any hopes of making enough money during the summer to pay for school. 

Just as I start to close in on my last couple hundred dollars, I get a call! Jaggar is pissed, as he still hasn’t heard a thing. I’m not told much, just that I am to report to the main Murphy’s gift shop for computer work. Now readers, this is the point of no return in this story. I was about to fully enter a world that would grip me for four summers, before nearly breaking me in the summer of 2020. The next chapters will be themed by individuals who have drastically shaped my time at Murphy’s

**Luna Specialty Coffee**  
Was located along 32nd street (NAC Tower), BGC. For people who find the name familiar, this is a small branch of Lino Cayetano's Luna Cafe. Their other branch was along High Street (Luna Breakfast & Coffee) and was featured by Kris Aquino in Kris TV.

I loved hanging out there during their Wednesday acoustic sessions, I loved the chill vibe of the shop, the friendly baristas. Also loved their adobo flakes (I miss that!). There were days na ako lang customer and audience nung performer and nakikipagkwentuhan na lang samin ng barista. The last time I saw them was like 2019, which was also the time I moved out of BGC and just before lockdown happened.

**Caffe Pascucci**  
Was located sa labas and gilid ng Glorietta 2, same side and near CBTL halos katabi lang sila. They used to have 2 branches, another in Robinsons Galleria. Caffe Pascucci is an Italian coffeehouse chain, they have branches in other countries din. 

Before I got into specialty coffee, I used to go to this shop a lot like way back in 2013 or 2014. I had an unhealthy obsession with their signature drink, Pascuccio, and I frequented the Glorietta branch a lot. I always thought it was going to be the next big thing after SB and CBTL kept expanding in PH, they had excellent dessert drinks and I found they had a lot more creative drink offerings than the other two did. They had interesting interior design as well, a bit too dark and aggressively black & red for my liking, but it was definitely unique. Not exactly sure when they closed down, I think Glorietta branch closed like 2016 or so.

Without going into details, I'll just ask you to have faith in the claim that I've cooked well over 10,000 breakfasts to a reasonably high standard in my career. So I would say, as qualified as anyone. I'm also hungover, a state which, while deadening some areas of the brain, sharpens one's focus on the particulars of a Full English.

 I don't claim to have absolute authority on what dictates the platinum standard. However, there are some observations that I can make with a high level of certainty. I'll be less open to being contradicted on those. Not closed, but less open.

There are some aspects of the Platinum Standard  Full English that I'd like to open to the community.

 I'm sure some opinions will be equally valid and irreconcilable. What I'd ask is that you offer your opinion with humility and respect. We're not seeking the ""wrong"" way to do it here, we're seeking to get as close to the unanimous most perfect iteration as it's possible to get. 

I'd like to conclude this introduction by establishing that this discussion ought to only be open to those who can confidently assume the appellation of ""Connoisseur"" regarding English breakfast related matters.

Now, to business.

The Essentials

Without any doubt, we can say that the following are needed:

Eggs

Bacon

Sausages

Mushrooms

Black Pudding* (more on this later)

Tomatoes

Baked Beans

A Potato Based Accompaniment 

A Bread Based Accompaniment 

A Condiment

A Hot Beverage

I wholeheartedly feel that if you are already in disagreement with these basics, your participation is no longer welcome. That's said without animosity. I fully respect your right to disagree, I am just unable to change my view here.

Scottish/Irish/Ulster

In my view, the only accompaniment from the above variations that elevates the Full English, is white pudding and I will talk about this more later. The other unique accompaniments from variations don't add anything that shouldn't already be there. Going forwards, we're talking about the ultimate Full English in particular.

Eggs

I think that two ""sunny side up"", fried, class A, free range (or better still, locally sourced) hen eggs is the only real option here. Whilst we all know and appreciate how scrambled and poached eggs are still very nice, the eating experience changes significantly enough that fried eggs should be the expectation. 

The yolks should obviously be runny, a light golden crisp can develop at the extremities of the albumen but the white should otherwise be gently fried and easily cuttable. The golden colour of the yolks should be visible which means that, if a lid has been used for more even cooking, the steaming of the tops of the eggs can't be excessive. The tops of the eggs may be seasoned with Maldon and freshly cracked white pepper towards the end of cooking.

Because of the surface area covered by the eggs, they ought to be placed on the warmed plate before anything else. The whites can be obscured by other accompaniments (we'll talk about the Alan Partridge thing later), but the yolks must be visible.

Bacon

I believe that back bacon and streaky bacon are both acceptable. My preference is streaky bacon. I think that the bacon should be smoked, offering a different flavour profile to the other pork based accompaniments. I believe that less than three rashers is disappointing. The bacon should be dry cured and thick cut is preferable to thin.

An important note is that the fat of the bacon must be rendered. The best method to achieve this is to cook betwixt baking parchment in the oven first and then crisp in the frying pan to finish. The bacon must be crispy, but not brittle.

Sausages

Sausages must be >95% pork. Plain or Lincolnshire and Cumberland regional variants are both acceptable but the Cumberland sausage ought not to be in the traditional coil.

The sausages should be browned on all sides and fried gently to avoid splitting of the skins or extrusion of the meat on either end. I am of the view that 2 sausages is superior to 3 but I understand this is contentious.

Mushrooms

I am personally against the whole flat cooked mushroom. I think they cool too quickly and hold too much moisture. For me, flat, button, chestnut, Portobello or closed cup are all acceptable, but they must be sliced and fried slowly in a small amount of oil to extract moisture and intensify their flavour. A small knob of butter can be added and the temperature increased to finish, developing come caramelisation. Salt and a copious amount of freshly ground black or white pepper should be used to finish them.

Black Pudding

I feel strongly that black pudding is an essential accompaniment but I do respect it is not for everyone. The black pudding should be best available quality. Small diameter is preferable to large but both are acceptable. One slice of large diameter should be used or two of small. The slices should be crispy on both sides and piping hot throughout.

N.B. If using white pudding, say for a treat, it can be used in addition to, not instead of, black pudding. In that case, one slice of small diameter of each should be used and cooked in the same way.

Tomatoes

I feel quite strongly that a good quality, fresh, vine ripened tomato cooked in the appropriate method is without question superior to the tinned plum style. There is, however, a way to incorporate tinned tomatoes to a high standard if that is your preference which I will outline below.

The fresh tomato should be fully ripe, halved lengthways and the stem trimmed neatly out with two small 45 degree cuts. It should be seasoned with salt (I often insert a sliver of garlic into the locular gel and use a tiny pinch of dried oregano later but I accept this is a personal preference and shouldn't be included in the specification). The tomato halves should be placed, flat side down, onto a hot grilling surface or frying pan until the cross sectional flesh in attractively charred. They can then be flipped and pepper can be cracked onto the flat sides. The tomatoes should be finished in the oven to cook fully through so the flesh isn't firm at all.

If using tinned plum tomatoes, they ought to be simmered in a small pan and should be seasoned with salt and lots of white pepper. The finished tomatoes should be served with minimal tomato juice from cooking.

Baked Beans

Heinz is obviously the gold standard, but there are increasingly acceptable alternatives. The beans should be gently simmered in a pan to the point that the starch just begins to thicken the sauce. Beans should be added to the plate secondly after the eggs, due to the surface area taken up.

N.B. Regarding the humorous Alan Partridge quote: ""Minor criticism, more distance between the eggs and the beans. I may want to mix them but I want that to be my decision. Use a sausage as a breakwater."" The popularity of the show means that eggs not touching the beans has become a cultural standard adopted by people who like to echo Partridge's infantile fussiness when they encounter a bean-egg convergence. I'm of the view that it is utter nonsense because the combining of items is the joy of a full English and the intention of the joke serves not to highlight a popular cultural preference but to illustrate that Partridge is elaborately juvenile and ungrateful.

Potato Based Accompaniment

This is a particularly tricky area to nail. Bubble and squeak is traditional and probably quite preferable, however, the need for leftover roast potatoes and cabbage for a ""true"" bubble and squeak is an understandably difficult proposition. While I'm ashamed to defer to the Americans on this, I am of the view that hash browns very conveniently provide the majority of the function of bubble and squeak, and therefore should be acceptable. Very interested to hear views on this. I think it cannot be argued that a true, leftovers bubble and squeak cooked properly is superior.

Chips are not acceptable.

Bread Based Accompaniment

In short, I think that the optimal solution here is two slices of plain sourdough, one toasted and buttered, one fried. Fried bread is a real treat when done right but toast is an essential mopping tool. The best of both worlds is possible, so why do it any other way?

The fried bread may be served on the same plate as the rest of the items but the toast should ideally be on its own small plate. This is because fried bread takes much longer to get soggy than toast. Partridge's OCD would have been justified if this was his gripe.

Condiment

I think HP sauce has the ultimate monopoly here. I have tried other brown sauces and I really think they don't hold up. Essentially, the condiment should be dealer's choice, but if you gave me a selection of sauces and HP wasn't there, I wouldn't be eating the platinum standard full English.

Hot Beverage

I will cut to the chase here and say it is tea and by that I mean it is a strong Yorkshire tea with a drop of whole milk. Coffee doesn't have the refreshing quality of tea and is a horrible thing to ""wash down"" a proper full English.

Other Garnishes

I've received a significant enough push back from garnishing with things like chives that I think it's best to omit them entirely. Tensions will be high enough as it is and I have a family to think about.

So there we have it. Whether or not I'm on the spectrum shouldn't have a bearing in your decision to respond with your own views or valid criticisms. These are my observations and beliefs in a long, practical study of this cultural mainstay. Perfection is impossible, I understand that, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for it. This concludes my thesis and the discussion is now open to contributors.

I'm 116 lbs at 5’4” and my weight has stayed in the 115-120 range for the past 4 ish years. 

Recently everywhere I go people have been telling me that I look like I don't eat and I get where they're coming from cause the lack of fat shows up on my face. My eyes are sorta sunken, strong jaw and the cheeks are hollowed as well. 

I wanted to gain 10 lbs by 2025 but I realized in the process that my eating habits in general are not normal. I used to not really eat breakfast before school in high school and it's the same now in uni. It's not that I don't have time but I never feel hungry until like 3 or 4 pm in the afternoon. I drink tea or coffee in the morning to feel awake and usually that's enough to get me through the classes. 

My classes usually end at 3 and by then I'm freaking starving, so when I get home I eat a huge huge meal (probably equivalent to 3 servings) and then I'm done for the day. The thought of eating when I'm not hungry doesn't make sense to me. My sisters say it's weird how there will be the best cake we've ever had in the fridge but I still won't have the temptation to eat that if I'm not hungry. 

I've tried to get myself to eat before classes but that gets me super sleepy by 10 or 11 am. I workout like 2-3 times a week and it's just basic cardio for 30-40 mins to keep my heart healthy. I also don't eat 3-4 hours before bed cause then I feel stuffed and have trouble feeling comfortable enough to fall asleep. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Why's it that I feel hungry that too on a severe level only once a day? How do I fix this and start building up a normal routine of 3 meals a day and hopefully gain a few pounds to look healthier?  ",1,1729426247.0,PetiteFitness,5,0.6,False
