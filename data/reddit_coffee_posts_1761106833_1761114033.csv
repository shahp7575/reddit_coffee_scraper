( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

He’s been sliding me gifts: a sleek coffee mug, dark chocolates on my desk, and a choker he said “belongs around your neck.” 
It’s hot but twisted. He’s always pushing to drive me home after late shifts. Last week, he sent a gym snap to my phone, I didn’t reply, but it fucked me up.

At our last office party, things got unhinged. On the dance floor, he yanked me against him, lips grazing my throat, and went for a hungry kiss. I dodged, pulse hammering, but later, wasted on tequila, we made out in a dark corner, later he texted me“you’re mine.” 
I’m on leave, working from home, dreading seeing him. He’s intoxicating, but this power game’s dangerous.

I was given a list of foods I should and shouldn't eat and cant help but feel like im being told to starve. I've ate nothing but oatmeal and bananas since and im already sick of it. I was never really an unhealthy eater, my biggest flaw was my occasional guilty pleasure of pizza rolls which are now taunting me from my freezer, but now trying to find something I can eat feels like a second job. Well, not finding something I CAN eat but rather something I WANT to eat. Before, I used to make many different kinds of meals, I love all meats, most fruits, and a few veggies and always new a good way to season and prepare it but now it feels like my kitchen is full of poisons. Something as simple as a little pepper on a bland piece of grilled chicken could put me back in that state of pain. I know, first world struggles.

Spent two nights at Il Tornabuoni in Florence (Sept 16–18).
Booked a 2 King Bed Suite on a cash + points rate — €824 + 24,000 World of Hyatt points per night. Explorist status; had to ask for late checkout but they gave me 12:30 p.m.

Location & Arrival

Easy taxi ride from Santa Maria Novella station. The hotel sits on Via Tornabuoni — Burberry downstairs, Ferragamo HQ across the street, Ponte Santa Trinita half a block away. In other words, right in it.

Lobby staff were kind but frazzled; the place feels a little understaffed. No elite recognition, just fruit and water waiting upstairs.

The guest mix? Basically all Hyatt people and Chase-points travelers (myself included). You can tell. It’s not the Euro-oligarch crowd — more “I read Flyertalk and finally burned some URs.”

The Suite

Two true bedrooms, two bathrooms, big living room (~47 m²). One room had an en-suite bath; the other had a balcony and separate bath. Both had walk-in showers and bidets.

Worth flagging: this layout isn’t standard. I actually sent the hotel a YouTube video of the exact suite I wanted 11 months before check-in, and they confirmed no other room has this setup. So if you want it, book early and put your request in writing.

Decor leans Florentine: red wallpaper, tufted furniture, lacquered trim. Feels charming but not pristine — a little peeling wallpaper here, sticker residue there. Still super comfortable and surprisingly spacious for the price.

Service

Warm but sloppy. When I asked for late checkout, the agent literally said, “We can do 12:30, that’s the best we can do,” like we were bargaining over market produce. Laundry took two full days. Turn-down was fine. Staff means well, just not trained to five-star standards.

Dining & Bar

Didn’t eat breakfast, but the rooftop looked nice for a morning coffee. Bar scene is exactly what you’d expect: American couples comparing points redemptions over spritzes. Chill, not glamorous.

Public Spaces & Fitness

The building’s a palazzo, so lots of charm but weird flow. They’ve filled the corridors with mannequins in gowns and jewelry displays — part art, part boutique mall.

Gym is tiny: two cardio machines and two strange resistance contraptions that don’t really work. No pool, no spa. If you’re hoping to lift, forget it.

Overall

Comfortable, central, and good-natured — but clearly a points hotel, not a luxury palace. Materials feel mid-range, service is hit-or-miss, and the polish isn’t there.

Value

For €824 + 24k points in September, it was a steal. Two bedrooms, two baths, prime location. Florence’s heavy hitters (Four Seasons, Portrait, The Place) run €2–3 k a night for smaller rooms.

Would I stay again? Yes, but only on points and only for a couple nights. Perfect for Hyatt loyalists who want a comfortable base before moving somewhere actually opulent.

⸻

TL;DR:
	•	Killer location
	•	Warm but messy service
	•	Big rooms, small gym
	•	All Hyatt/Chase crowd
	•	Great value, not high luxury

I’ve been thinking seriously about getting my first e-bike. I’m kinda tired of spending money on gas just to drive a few miles to work every day, so I’m hoping to finally ditch the car for good.

My commute is about 6 miles each way, mostly on city streets and bike lanes with a few small hills. I’m looking for something reliable for daily use — ideally with a throttle for those days when I just don’t feel like pedaling too hard.

I’ll also be using it to run errands: grocery runs, quick coffee trips, visiting friends nearby, that kind of stuff. I don’t need anything super fancy, but I want it to hold up well over time and handle a bit of rough pavement or light gravel.

My budget’s under $2,000. I’ve been checking out a few options like the Aventon 3, Puckipuppy Boxer ST, and RadPower 6 Plus.

 Each one has a mix of good and bad reviews, so I figured I’d ask if anyone here owns one and can share some real-world experiences.

 Oh, and good customer service matters too — that’s a big one for me.

The hull thundered under the detonations of torpedoes. Radiation warnings flared up as some of the enemy weapons managed to focus the radiation of nuclear warheads laser like, and able to irradiate the inert hull plating

Lieutenant Davies stumbled through the hallway, broken struts blocking her path. Beneath her helmet, she was sweating profusely. The lights in the corridor flickered, and arcs of lightning from severed cables gave the scene a haunted flair.

Out of breath, she reached the CIC. The bulkhead had warped under the volley yesterday. Karrn and Chief Ferguson had to cut it open since it was the last possible access to the CIC.

Entering the compartment, she hurried over to the Admiral. “Sir, report from Sickbay. Dr. Nesbitt says either we evacuate the injured to the planet, or we condemn them to radiation sickness and death.”

“Understood. Ferguson?” The Admiral had aged considerably in the five days the space battle for Taishar Tar had dragged on. It wasn’t a battle—it was a beating, with the Batract doing the beating.

“Flight deck isn’t operational anymore. We can’t open the hangar doors—they’re all stuck closed, sir.”

“Recommendations?”

“None, sir… until this battle’s over, we can’t do a thing. Sorry, sir.”

The Admiral turned around, focusing on the tactical view. “Why don’t they come closer? They throw rocks and torpedo volleys at us without a break. That can’t be their only strategy. And why focus solely on us? What’s so special about the *Argos*?”

“Not only the *Argos*—don’t forget their first strike was at the *Rosalind Franklin*,” Gerber interjected.

“Right. What was special about her?”

“Batract. Lots and lots of Batract spawn,” Karrn growled while helping two techs clear the way to the bulkhead leading to the bridge, which had collapsed under the force of multiple megaton detonations close to the hull.

“Sir, we can’t take much more. The whole enemy fleet is firing at us constantly. Even though our escorts are doing their best to take out the torpedoes and rocks, something always comes through. The bridge is offline, engines six to twelve don’t exist anymore. *Lyra* is constantly plotting new headings through the fire to give us a few minutes of respite.”

Chief Ferguson was right. In the stream of transmissions, it was clear to see—the torpedo salvos all had the *Argos* as their target. Torpedoes passed other ships without engaging, all of them following the flagship.

The ship looked battered, and no matelot on board was uninjured.

“If only C-plus cannons were a thing,” Davies mumbled while digging a chair out of the rubble.

“What did you say?” Ferguson stood absolutely still. Obviously, he had an epiphany.

“C-plus cannons—a Clarke-tech device from a classic sci-fi novel series I read in college. Cannons that shoot faster than light.” *What’s so special about it? They’re magical technology and wouldn’t work in reality anyway.* She couldn't understand his fuss about that idea

Ferguson ran over to her, hugging her tightly. “Oh, you beautiful and smart Welsh princess, you just might have saved us.” Then he was gone, running in the direction of the armory, as far as Davies could see.

The Admiral looked at her, and she couldn’t hide her blush. The hug had surprised her completely.

“What’s Clarke-tech?” Karrn came over to her, panting heavily inside his suit as he recharged the oxygen in his tank from the supply port at the station next to Davies.

“Its not real technology. A Classical Author, Arthur C. Clarke, once made the quote: *‘Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’* So we call technology that’s too advanced to even describe *Clarke-tech.*”

Karrn flicked his ears inside his helmet to show his amusement. Davies couldn’t help but smile; she had always thought that gesture was cute.

 

—————

 

Chief Ferguson hurried down the hallway to the armory, almost stumbling over a fallen strut from a bulkhead. On his way he found Tech Visser fixing some fiber cables. “Visser—good. Hurry down into fabrication and get me a micro A-Drive out of a Pigeon and two spare copper coils, quickly. Bring it to the ship armory.”

Visser stared at the sweating, heavily panting chief as if he had been ordered to replace the ship’s hull with chocolate. “What?”

“Don’t talk. Don’t think. Run.” Ferguson didn’t have time to explain every little detail to everyone. He had to act now.

He’d been part of the *Mjolnir* project ten years ago; they tried to make FTL torpedoes, but it failed—micro drives need massive energy but can’t carry mass, a fatal flaw. Davies’ idea wouldn’t have worked two years ago because the caliber of a main gun was too small. But now… the *Argos*’ main gun had a bigger caliber, so theoretically a projectile could be equipped with a micro drive, and the energy could be sapped directly from the gun itself.

The projectile traveling in FTL would only do so for about 6 AU before violently dropping out of FTL because it lacked the energy to sustain the field — but that was enough.

He reached the ship armory. From here he could access the feed loader of the main gun, and it had a small fabrication unit—perfect for his test.

The two techs were working on the feed-loader hydraulic press. The constant bombardment had left it a bit… wonky. But if his upgrade worked, one shot per minute would be enough.

“Get me a tungsten-osmium, 50-cm, out here,” Ferguson barked without explanation.

The two techs just stared at him. “Sir?”

“Get me the projectile out of the feeder. We have to open it up and modify it.”

“Yes, sir.” They didn’t understand—he’d explain later. But first he had to get his breathing under control; running wasn’t his sport, not at all.

The feeder extracted one of the 5-ton projectiles: a 50-cm diameter, 1.5-meter-long tungsten casing filled to the brim with osmium balls. The feeder could extract or inject osmium at will to change the projectile’s impact behavior, though it could also be done by hand.

As they worked, he explained his theory: lower the weight of the projectile to less than one ton, then install the micro A-Drive and run copper coils to tap energy from the railgun to charge the drive, allowing a transit.

They stared at him like he had grown a second head—each of them trying to find a flaw in his reasoning, but unable to do so.

The 5,000 kg projectile rested on the feeder’s arm, ready to be put into the chamber. The technicians used heavy tools to open the bottom latch of the tungsten casing so they could extract the osmium ballast — that was the simplest task. Ferguson finished programming the fabricator station to strip just enough tungsten from the casing so they could attach the coils in the notch.

Visser reached the armory with the requested parts and seemed to understand the idea of the jury-rig instantly.

“Sir, you could install a third coil that charges a capacitor, providing additional energy to create a variable time-delay fuse of sorts.”

Ferguson just nodded; he had to remember to keep an eye on Visser — that man was wicked smart.

His estimations were right: the micro A-Drive fit inside the casing. Thank God for the military need for ever-greater guns.

After about ten minutes, the prototype was finished.

“Amazing, guys. If that works, we’re slated for the history books. Get these blueprints to tenders with fabrication capabilities — they should be able to send us a hundred per hour. We’ll need them, soon.”

The ship shook again violently. From the sound of it, they’d just been hit with another nuke. Soon they’d run out of kinetic gel for the hull plating — then the real damage would start.

He sprinted back to the CIC, ignoring all the eyes on him, and went straight to his engineering console to enter the new parameters for the targeting solution.

*Lyra*, always present and watching, commented on his calculations. “Chief Ferguson, these numbers don’t make sense, not unless we can fire faster-than-light ammunition.”

Admiral Browner turned in a jolt to face the chief. “Don’t tell me you managed—”

“Might. We might have managed it. At the moment we have one test shot.”

Browner seemed to energize at that. “Fire control, I remember the ship that sent us an extremely nasty volley two days ago. Would you kindly make it go away?”

The young lieutenant at the station grinned at the command. “Yes, sir!”

Ferguson could feel the ship turn to face the Batract vessel. *Damn — the inertia compensators must be on the brink of failure.*

“Fire when ready,” the Admiral ordered.

“Aye aye, sir. Firing now.”

Ferguson could have sworn the shot felt different; seeing the others react, he was sure of it. *The anomaly is created inside the barrel — that’s it.*

“Time to target… 85 seconds.” The last words came with utter astonishment.

He could see Karrn stepping closer to the holo display, his ears upright in full attention.

Except for the flickering lights in the CIC, nothing moved; no one even dared to breathe. Ferguson calculated in his head: 85 seconds to the target, then 1 minute until our spy probe detects the impact, and 85 seconds until the *Pigeon* reached the ship with the information.

He decided he had time to grab a coffee. He needed it.

He came back to the tactical table just as a red dot disappeared.

“Kill confirmed.”

The room erupted in cheers. After getting beaten on by the enemy for five straight days, they had finally struck back.

Browner stared at Ferguson. “Son, you might have just saved this system.”

“Nah, Admiral — it was Lieutenant Davies who gave me the idea.”

The Admiral grinned. “You mean the beautiful and smart Welsh princess?”

Now it was Ferguson’s turn to blush.

Before anyone could say anything, the Admiral added, “Let’s call this ammunition *Welsch Princess*, shall we?”

Ferguson just stammered, “Very good, sir,” and with a glance at Davies, went back to his station.

“Sir, the *Hephaestus* reports the first batch of… *Welsch Princesses?*” The tech seemed to stumble over the name — and the plural of *princess.* “They’re arriving now. First batch is fifteen, then they can deliver one shot per minute.”

The Admiral nodded at the information.

“Also, *Hephaestus* sends their congratulations to Chief Ferguson for successfully raping physics.”

The admiral studied the tactical overview.

“*Lyra*, I suggest we take out *Tango 15* first. They’re the farthest away from *Tango One*—our practical test target—so a full volley would surprise them the most.”

“Correct, sir. Given their distance, they will notice the shots in around twenty-five minutes.”

“Fire control, you’ve got your targets. Rapid fire at will.”

Now that Visser had joined the repair crew at the feed loader, the ship was able to fire with a cadence of one shot every seven seconds.

The Batract ships exploded in the most unusual ways. Hit by the energy of a 2,000-kg mass vaporized at *35c*, just centimeters inside their hull plating, the ships were sucked inward at the penetration point and ripped open on the opposite side.

Basically the ships got inverted

The other vessels of the thirty-four-ship detachment could not react—especially since the fire team on the *Argos* targeted the outer ships in the spherical formation first. The inner ships had to navigate debris from the already destroyed vessels to escape the destruction; only four managed.

Across the ships of the First Expeditionary Fleet, crews prepared for the inevitable rush that would follow sooner rather than later.

“Tango 15 — thirty confirmed hits. They didn’t see what’s coming at them. Surviving ships are splitting up to other Tangos, probably to warn them.”

“Take out *Tango 9* next. Let’s act predictable until they think they can predict our actions.”

“Aye, sir. Firing now.”

The hum of the charging capacitors transferred through the deck plating; Ferguson noticed a slight variance in the harmonics, as any chief engineer would on his own ship.

He already had sixty percent of his repair crew working on the main gun to keep it operational; the rest were making sure the flight controls worked.

“Sir were fired dry, we need at least half an hour to reload.” Having destroyed that many enemy ships in that short of time was like a high for them.

“Incoming Salvo” The enemy hadn't stopped firing at them, but now, with two Squadrons less, it was easier to avoid hits, again all fire was concentrate on the Argos.

 

—————

 

Captain Gerber didn’t share the excitement. He was fully immersed in the mystery of the Batract’s choice of targets.

The *Argos* was the most modern ship in the fleet, but in terms of pure firepower, there were others that could bring much more to the fight. *Minerva*, for example, was one of the torpedo cruisers that could have hurt them far more — if she had been closer.

He went through the first attack reports of the fleet. They had hit *Mirage* first but quickly changed targets. *Mirage* was an obvious choice — as a destroyer, she had weak armor but was essential in defending the fleet against inbound missiles and torpedoes, a fact the Batract surely knew since they possessed highly accurate intelligence on human shipbuilding.

Lightspeed delay. They were at six AU distance; any signal from the First Expeditionary to the enemy fleet would have taken forty-eight minutes to reach the Batract.

*Argos* and *Rosalind Franklin*… what did both ships have in common?

Then it hit him. Both vessels had been the most heavily infested with Batract spawn, and both had — previously — carried the highest number of integration officers on board.

Was there something the Batract were afraid we could discover? How would they know — except if something, or someone, in the fleet was sending information to the enemy.

The fist expeditionary was compromised.

1od0e81,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1od0e81/best_vpns_for_onlyfans/,Best VPNs for OnlyFans,"OnlyFans has revolutionized content monetization, but using the platform comes with significant privacy and security challenges. Whether you're a creator protecting your identity or a subscriber concerned about privacy, your OnlyFans activity creates a digital trail that can expose you to serious risks.

**Your internet service provider can see every website you visit—including OnlyFans.** In countries with strict content regulations, this visibility can lead to legal consequences. For creators, the stakes are even higher: stalking, doxxing, and harassment remain persistent threats. With OnlyFans experiencing a major data breach affecting 5 million accounts in early 2025, the need for robust privacy protection has never been more urgent.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) isn't just an optional extra—it's an essential security tool for anyone using OnlyFans. This guide examines the specific privacy threats facing OnlyFans users and recommends the best VPNs to protect your identity, secure your connection, and maintain access regardless of your location.

# Why OnlyFans Users Need a VPN

Using OnlyFans without a VPN exposes you to multiple privacy and security vulnerabilities that go beyond the platform's built-in protections.

# Privacy Protection from ISP Tracking

Every time you access OnlyFans, your internet service provider logs your activity. **ISPs can see the websites you visit, when you visit them, and how long you stay.** This data can be sold to advertisers, shared with authorities, or potentially leaked in data breaches. For OnlyFans users, this visibility creates obvious privacy concerns—whether you're accessing adult content as a subscriber or managing your creator account.

A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, making your OnlyFans usage invisible to your ISP. Instead of seeing ""OnlyFans.com,"" your provider only sees encrypted data traveling to a VPN server.

# Bypassing Regional Restrictions

OnlyFans is blocked or restricted in at least 16 countries as of 2025, including:

* **Complete bans:** China, Russia, Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Angola
* **Creation restrictions:** India (viewing allowed, posting adult content illegal), Turkey (intermittent blocks), Thailand (adult content restricted), Belarus (access nearly impossible)

In February 2025, UAE authorities reaffirmed their commitment to blocking adult content platforms through both technical measures and legal penalties. Turkey implemented stricter enforcement measures against OnlyFans in January 2025, with court decisions classifying it under pornography distribution regulations.

**A VPN allows you to connect through servers in countries where OnlyFans operates freely**, effectively circumventing these geographic restrictions. This proves essential for travelers, expatriates, and creators managing international audiences.

# Enhanced Security Against Threats

OnlyFans users face specific security risks that VPNs help mitigate:

**Data Breach Exposure**: The 2025 OnlyFans data leak compromised approximately 5 million accounts, exposing personal information that could be exploited by cybercriminals. While the breach didn't include passwords or payment details, the exposed data created risks for identity theft and targeted attacks.

**Deanonymization and Doxxing**: OnlyFans logs each user's IP address, which can be used to infer location or link activity across multiple sessions. For creators, this information could enable stalkers to determine their general location. A VPN replaces your real IP address with one from its server network, breaking this connection.

**Unsecured Network Vulnerabilities**: OnlyFans chats and messages aren't end-to-end encrypted, so if a connection is compromised, private conversations could potentially be exposed. Public WiFi networks are particularly dangerous, making VPN protection essential when accessing OnlyFans from coffee shops, hotels, or airports.

# What to Look for in a VPN for OnlyFans

Not all VPNs provide adequate protection for OnlyFans users. Focus on these critical features:

**Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256 encryption is the industry standard and effectively unbreakable. This ensures your OnlyFans traffic remains private even if intercepted.

**Verified No-Logs Policy**: The VPN provider should have an independently audited no-logs policy, confirming they don't store your browsing history, connection times, or IP addresses. This prevents your OnlyFans usage from being recorded even by the VPN company itself.

**Fast Streaming Speeds**: OnlyFans is a media-heavy platform. Your VPN needs to maintain fast connection speeds to stream video content without buffering or quality degradation.

**Large Server Network**: More servers in more countries means better options for bypassing geo-blocks and finding fast, uncongested connections.

**Kill Switch**: If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, a kill switch immediately blocks all internet traffic, preventing your real IP address from being exposed.

**DNS Leak Protection**: This ensures your DNS queries (website name lookups) are routed through the VPN rather than your ISP, maintaining complete privacy.

**Privacy-Friendly Jurisdiction**: VPN companies based in countries without mandatory data retention laws offer stronger privacy protections.

# Additional Security Measures for OnlyFans Users

A VPN is your first line of defense, but comprehensive protection requires a layered security approach:

**Account Security**:

* Use a strong, unique password and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra security layer
* Create a separate email address that does not include your real name and is separate from your personal or work email accounts
* Never reuse passwords from other accounts
* Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords

**Privacy Protection**:

* Use an anonymous email service like ProtonMail for account setup
* Create a pseudonymous profile that doesn't reveal your real identity
* Remove metadata from content, use different filters, makeup, and wigs if you're a creator
* Avoid sharing identifiable information in content or conversations
* Consider using OnlyFans' geoblocking feature to prevent access from specific regions

**Device Security**:

* Use dedicated devices only for OnlyFans to isolate any potential security compromise
* Install reputable antivirus software to protect against malware and ransomware
* Keep your operating system and applications updated with the latest security patches
* Never access OnlyFans on public or shared computers

**Financial Security**:

* Monitor your bank statements regularly for unauthorized charges
* Consider using virtual credit cards or privacy-focused payment methods
* Be cautious of phishing attempts that target OnlyFans users with fake payment emails

# Legal Considerations

**VPN legality varies by country**. Using a VPN is legal in most countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and most of Europe. However, some countries penalize VPN use, and using a VPN may help bypass restrictions but could violate OnlyFans' terms of service and local regulations.

Before using a VPN to access OnlyFans:

* Research your local laws regarding VPN usage and access to adult content platforms
* Understand that bypassing regional restrictions may violate OnlyFans' Terms of Service
* Note that VPNs don't bypass age verification requirements—you must still be 18+ and complete OnlyFans' verification process
* Be aware that some countries impose penalties for accessing banned websites, even with a VPN

**This guide is for informational purposes only. Users are responsible for complying with their local laws and OnlyFans' Terms of Service.**

1od0dk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1od0dk2/my_confession_from_a_high_school_crush_to_a_crazy/,My Confession: From a High School Crush to a Crazy Foursome,"   Back in 12th grade, I fell hard for this girl. She was everything gorgeous, electric, the kind of person who made your heart race just being near her. I never told her how I felt, not a word to anyone, and it ate at me. It hurt even more when she started dating my best friend. That betrayal cut deep, and over time, our friendship turned sour. I ended up hating him, carrying that grudge and my feelings for her like a heavy load, even as life moved on.
A month ago, I ran into her at a coffee shop, and it was like stepping back in time. My pulse was pounding, those old feelings rushing back. She worked near me, and I was in a long-distance thing with a girl from work who’d been transferred. Her boyfriend,my old friend, who I couldn’t stand was also long-distance, so we were both kind of free, in a way. I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I told her I’d been in love with her back in high school. She hit me with a shock, she’d loved me too. But she was still with him, committed. Then she tossed out something wild, friends with benefits, no strings, just physical. I was stunned but didn’t hesitate. I didn’t love her anymore, not like before, but the attraction was still fire. I wanted her, plain and simple.
We moved fast. Since we worked in the same city, we rented a house together, and it became our spot. We’ve been hooking up every single day, sometimes seven to ten times on holidays, going from morning to night. It’s like every fantasy I had in high school came to life. I wasn’t worried about what might happen. I’d deal with whatever came up. But I knew we had to be smart. We used condoms every time and made sure she was on birth control to keep things safe. The house made it easy, private, nobody else in the loop.
Then my girlfriend came back to our workplace, and I couldn’t keep it secret. I spilled everything—the crush, the daily hookups, the house. I thought she’d lose it, but she was… okay with it. More than that, she was into it. I threw out the idea of a threesome with her and my crush, and they both jumped at it. The threesome was unreal, better than I could’ve imagined, and they were way more excited than me. They clicked, like actual friends, which made it even hotter. We kept it quiet, no workplace drama, just us having fun. We stayed safe, no slip-ups.
Things got crazier when my crush told her boyfriend,my ex-best friend, the one I’d hated for years. He’d just started working at my office, which could’ve been a disaster. I was ready for a fight, but when she told him about the FWB and threesomes, he was chill. Like, shockingly understanding. He called me, blown away that it was me all along, but not angry. We talked it out, and somehow, we’re tighter now than we ever were back then. The bad blood’s gone, and we’re building something new.
Now, with him staying at our house, my girlfriend and crush dropped another bombshell: they wanted to try cuckolding, where he’d watch me with his girlfriend or know it’s happening. But it’s turned into something bigger , a full-on foursome, all four of us, set for Sunday. The plan’s wild, me with my crush, him with my girlfriend, rotating partners on the same bed, going from morning to night with breaks to keep it going. We prepared ,eating good food, lots of protein and carbs, staying hydrated, resting up for the marathon. They’re all hyped, especially the girls, who are pushing this harder than me or him.
Here’s the big twist, we’ve decided to skip condoms. We talked about the risks, especially pregnancy, and we’re all okay with it. There’s a 50-50 chance any baby from my girlfriend or crush could be mine or his. We’re not sweating it paternity, co-parenting, whatever comes, we’ll figure it out.
The house is our spot, but with him staying and my girlfriend coming over, it’s getting crowded. We keep it normal outside hookups—separate bedrooms, no sex stuff lying around. At work, we’re careful: no talk about this, no flirty vibes, just “we’re roommates” if anyone asks. Nobody at the office suspects, and we’re keeping it that way. I’m clear with my crush—it’s physical, not love. My girlfriend and I are open now, same with my crush and her boyfriend. We’re leaning into a poly thing, checking in to make sure it stays fun, no drama.
I’m not worried about what could go wrong. If there’s a baby, workplace gossip, or someone catching feelings, I’ll handle it. Tomorrow’s about living in the moment, connecting with people I trust, and pushing boundaries. My ex-best friend’s back in my life, my girlfriend’s game, my crush is still a spark, and we’re all on the same page. Today we’re chilling, eating well, and getting ready for a wild Sunday. This is my life, unfiltered, and I’m all in.",0,1761112974.0,confessions,1,0.5,False

We see a lot of hifi setups. Naturally. And it blows our collective minds how often we come across these basic mistakes. Its not anyone's fault really - sometimes people genuinely don't know, or weren't told by the store that they bought it from or the people they got it from.

Here's the five most common mistakes that we come across, and our tips on how to not make them. 

**Looking at a product in isolation without considering the system it's going in.**

We often have customers with systems made up of separate components, wanting to upgrade a part of their system, e.g. their amplifiers, or their speakers, or their cables.  All excited, they get it home, and despite all the specifications and the reviews saying that their new purchase should be the long-awaited upgrade they've been longing, they are bitterly disappointed.

This is because hifi is more complicated than that - after all, they are called ""hifi systems"". Its the system that produces the result, not the individual product. 

* What makes up the rest of your system?  
* How big is your room?  
* What sort of music sources to you use? 
* How, and who, interacts with your system? 

All these facets factor into the final result of the system. You might get lucky a few times just adding something without considering these factors, but more often than not, you end up with a system that's just ""different"", not ""better"" 

**Not taking the time to make sure your speakers are centimetre-perfect**

Its something that some people don't want you to know about, as its far easier to just sell someone a pair of speakers, bring it over to your house, dump it...about there, take the money and go. Ok, we get it, it takes time, and time is money, but particularly if someone is spending even $5000, don't you want to make sure they get the best out of their speakers?

**Thinking that subwoofers don't have a place in a stereo setup**

Stereo enthusiasts turn their nose up at subwoofers, thinking that somehow adding subwoofers to your stereo setup is a shortcut, or it means that your speakers are not good enough.

This is absolute and utter nonsense.

Subwoofers give you bass coverage, and they fix the inadequacies of all loudspeakers, no matter what brand, type, size or cost they are. 

**Not considering the shelf you put your equipment on**

This is one of our favourite demonstrations to do in the shop. We take a streamer, any streamer. We put the streamer on the floor and play a song. We then take the same streamer and put it on a coffee table. Then, we put the same streamer and put it on a hifi rack from HRS. And it sounds better, and better, and better. 

All electronics have parts that make mechanical vibrations. You can't see it, but you can measure it. And how well the surface you put your electronics on can control and dissipate those vibrations has a huge effect on their abilities to do their job. 

**5. Thinking cables don't matter!**

If you're still one of those cable deniers, that it can't possibly make a difference, that its all snake oil, then... well... you're doing yourself a disservice. Too often opinions on cables brings the worst out of humans. Look at any social media thread or forum where someone dares to ask about cables, and watch the swathes of entitled keyboard warrior trolls come out who shout and scream so loudly saying that no cables can possibly make a difference, despite (a) never having even bothering to try the cables themselves, and (b) they can't afford it so seek to belittle anyone that can in a pathetic effort to justify their own existence on this Earth. 

Sorry if we got a bit heated there. 

Fundamentally, cables act as a passive filter. All they can do is lose data from the signal path - they can't add anything. So a stance that every reasonable person can get behind is that the sole job of a cable is not to lose data when transmitting from one device to the next. ",1,1761112844.0,hifitipstricks,0,1.0,False

1od0b7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1od0b7i/my_sleep_schedule_is_starting_to_ruin_everything/,"My sleep ""schedule"" is starting to ruin everything","I genuinely don't know what's happening, why, or how; as of a couple weeks ago, I've been waking up at the crack of dawn (or even earlier) on the daily.

No matter what time I go to bed, I'll be awake my 6:00-6:30 in the morning at the LATEST. Sometimes it's around 5:00, some others 4:00. And when I wake up, no matter how hard I try, I can't fall back asleep.

I am currently unemployed and looking for a job, so it's not like I have somewhere to be in the morning. Used to work a 9:00-17:00, at which point in my life I would have to be up by 7:30 in order to get there on time, and always struggled. My mother, with whom I have shared this recent issue, jokingly says that ""It's always when people have no obligations that we wake up on time"" and I'll sometimes agree with her even though it's genuinely affecting me.

I've been feeling exhausted, having headaches or migraines, my body hurts. I can hardly focus on *anything* , and not to mention how my mood has plummeted dramatically. The fact that I am disabled doesn't help whatsoever — I'm epileptic and this has caused my seizures to worsen, hence my neurologist upping the medication dosage I have to take on the daily, which in turn affects my finances, and as part of a vicious cycle it fucks up my emotional state even further. I suffer from chronic pain anyway and it's somehow gotten worse too. My gynecologist suspects that my worsening PCOS is due to stress, which is also caused by this fucked sleep schedule. I've got mental illnesses to boot, and those aren't faring any better.

I've tried so many things. Due to this exhaustion from waking up early I usually end up napping for a couple hours at noon, sometimes willingly and others just straight up closing my eyes and falling asleep. I tried drinking coffee or splashing cold water on my face whenever I feel tired before nighttime, but coffee makes me feel even more tired and upsets my stomach, and the cold water method barely works. I tried to ""tough it out"", finding things to keep myself busy or otherwise occupied so that I don't fall asleep; reading, drawing, music, playing a video game, even sitting with a family member so they can kind of... Shake me awake if I happen to be falling asleep. I don't even use electronics as much anymore —like, maybe three hours at most per day now—, since I suspected that overuse might be causing this, and still nothing. I tried going out with friends or by myself, I tried exercising... Nothing.

I don't know what to do anymore. I look horrible, I've lost weight and hair and there's bags under my eyes. I want to go to a doctor but my mom thinks I'm blowing it out of proportion, that even though this isn't really ""ideal"" it's preferable to my previous situation where I'd wake up really late. She also thinks going to a doctor about it would be a waste of my already tight budget, and I can't help but see her point. Still, I am an adult, so in theory I *can* book an appointment for myself — but still, where do I go? What kind of doctor do I look for? I don't know.

But it's so fucking annoying. I could fall asleep at 21:00 or even 2:00am, and still be up by 6:00. No matter what time I turn in for the day, it's always like this.

I'm so desperate at this point, I'd even be willing to *somehow* try staying up for an entire 24 hours if it meant this would be fixed. Please, if anyone has also experienced this or has some sort of advice, share it. I don't know how much more of this my mental or even physical health for that matter can handle",1,1761112742.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

After a frustrating run-in with existing tools, I finally put together a fully functional email marketing platform. And here's the kicker: **it runs literally on just a $1 iCloud account.**

I've been through the wringer with platforms like **Mailchimp**, **Brevo**, **Hoppy Copy**, and a bunch of other 'enterprise solutions.' Honestly, they all feel the same: incredibly expensive, packed with a gazillion features you never use, and still clunky as hell when it comes to the basics. All I really needed was something that could send a high volume of emails, handle multiple domains seamlessly, and not break the bank.

So, out of principle and a strong desire for a better solution, I decided to build my own. This little setup can:
*   Send a high volume of messages.
*   Manage multiple domains (tested and working!).
*   Generate email content on the fly (thanks to a bit of AI wizardry).
*   Handle contact list uploads smoothly 
*   Handle unsubscribe and bounce 

And all of this for the cost of a coffee – quite literally, just that $1 iCloud storage plan. I'm genuinely surprised how robust this DIY project turned out to be.

Now I'm at a crossroads. This isn't just a fun hack; it feels like a genuinely viable, **dirt-cheap** alternative for startups, indie hackers, or anyone who's fed up with bloated SaaS subscriptions. My goal isn't to commercialize it. I'm seriously considering polishing it up and **making it completely free and open-source for everyone.**

What do you all think? Is this something you'd actually use? Am I crazy for trying to offer a free alternative to the big players, or is there real value in a zero-cost, functional email solution?

**TL;DR:** Tired of overpriced email marketing like Mailchimp/Brevo/Hoppy Copy? I built a full platform using a $1 iCloud account, handling high volume & multiple domains. Thinking of open-sourcing it for free. Is there interest here?

# A Warm, Cozy Welcome to Our Brand New Corner of History (and Snores!)

Hello and a very sleepy welcome to every one of you! If you’ve somehow managed to stumble upon this freshly-minted subreddit, it means you, too, are one of the discerning, wonderfully weird souls who prefers to be lulled into oblivion by a gentle, slightly absurd, and deeply comforting tale of the past. This is r/CheekyHistoryforSleep—your new sanctuary for discussing, dissecting, and celebrating the sleep stories that blend fascinating historical tidbits with the perfect amount of pre-slumber soothing.

For those of us who have tried all the white noise apps, the nature sounds, and the endless stream of guided meditations, only to find our minds still buzzing, *Cheeky History for Sleep* arrived like a benevolent, velvet-voiced genius. It’s the perfect antidote to anxiety and overthinking: just interesting enough to hold your attention, but delivered with such a buttery smoothness that your brain eventually says, “Okay, I’m done. I can rest now.”

Since this is our very first post, we need to set the historical tone! We need a thread that is not just a greeting, but a foundational document—a definitive collection of the community’s favorite slumber-inducing stories. So, let’s get right to the heart of the matter and get this historical slumber party rolling!

# The Essential Question: Which Story Is Your Absolute Favorite to Drift Off To, and Why?

Forget the *best* story (that’s too subjective!). We’re looking for your **Go-To, Desert Island, Guaranteed-to-Work Sleep Aid.** We want to know the episode you turn on when you’re utterly stressed, jet-lagged, or just staring at the ceiling at 3 AM.

We're not just looking for a title; we're looking for the **experience**. What makes that specific story your brain's off-switch?

# 🔎 The Three Pillars of Sleepy History Discussion

To really get this conversation going and help new listeners find their perfect match, let's structure our comments around these three key areas. Please try to hit at least one—but ideally all three—in your reply!

# 1. Name and Praise Your Top Story (The Title and the Topic)

* Is it an episode that dives into the absurd etiquette of the **Regency period**?
* Perhaps a deep dive into the surprisingly complex world of **Medieval street vendors**?
* Or maybe the quiet scandal of **19th-century mail delivery**?

Share the exact title or topic if you can! The sheer breadth of subjects covered is one of the podcast's greatest strengths, so let's start a proper, searchable list of the community's most beloved episodes. This is how we build a resource for the sleepless masses!

# 2. The ""Ahhh"" Moment (The Sleep Trigger)

Every listener has that one point in a story—a specific tone change, a phrase, a particular historical detail, or the host's cadence—that finally signals: *This is it. I’m out.*

* What is the **specific moment** that finally gets you? Is it the introduction of a particularly obscure historical figure?
* Is it the way the host describes the gentle sounds of a bustling marketplace, a quiet library, or a sleeping historical city?
* Does the narration slow down or drop into a whisper that just *hits different*?

Share your **personal sleep trigger**. This is where we get into the truly essential, unique details of what makes these stories so effective.

# 3. The Funniest Fact You Learned (The ""Cheeky"" Element)

The ""cheeky"" part of the show's title is essential! It’s the unexpected, often slightly ridiculous, historical details that keep the stories from being dry. It's the delightful sprinkle of *mild* stimulation that stops our minds from wandering into our own anxieties.

* What’s a fact you learned that made you genuinely giggle right before your brain shut down?
* Was it a bizarre historical law, a strange item of clothing, or an incredibly pompous historical quote?

These moments prove that learning something new can be just as relaxing as listening to a babbling brook. Share the detail that made you smile!

# My Contribution: Setting the Mood with a Tale of Forbidden Buzz

To demonstrate how it's done, I'll share my current go-to episode—the one that has officially replaced my previous sleep routine.

# My Top Story: ""When Coffee Was Forbidden | The Calm Tale of Ottoman Cafés""

This one is perfection for my brain. The entire narrative has this wonderful, almost conspiratorial whisper to it. It manages to be about *scandal* and *high tension* while sounding like the most relaxing thing on Earth.

# My ""Ahhh"" Moment (The Sleep Trigger):

For me, the switch flips right when the host describes the **ambiance of the first coffee houses in Istanbul**. They detail the low murmur of voices, the scent of the roasting beans and tobacco, and the *quiet intensity* of the discussions. It paints such a vivid, dark, and cozy scene that my brain is completely transported. I can almost smell the smoke and hear the clinking of the tiny cups. The fact that these places were a genuine threat to the Sultanate's power—and the descriptions of people meeting in secret—gives the story a wonderful, calming gravity. I'm usually asleep about halfway through the description of the Sultan’s spies lurking around the dimly lit corners.

# The Funniest Fact I Learned (The ""Cheeky"" Element):

The fact that **coffee was repeatedly banned** (and that the punishment for drinking it, at one point, was being sewn into a leather bag and thrown into the Bosphorus!) while people kept drinking it anyway is just so delightfully human. The host’s slightly incredulous tone when detailing the extreme measures taken by authorities really highlights the absurd power of a simple, caffeinated beverage. It reminds you that even the most serious historical figures were often undone by the silliest things—a perfect, cheekily comforting thought to fall asleep to.

# Let’s Build the Definitive r/CheekyHistoryforSleep Slumber List!

This community is going to be amazing, and it all starts right here. Let us know which episode is your personal guide to dreamland. Share the secrets that unlock your restful night.

**Get commenting, fellow history sleepers!** Can't wait to read about all the obscure, wonderful historical tales that are putting you all to sleep.

I'm 22Female and i have been single nearly all my life. The frustrating part is that im doing ""everything right"". I am attractive, fit, in school, working, talented, have interesting hobbies and etc. I am not doing all of this to find a man btw, i actually do love myself and i like to put effort in to the things i love. 
Love is just luck. You don't ""deserve"" it. I'm just so tired of waiting to be lucky. Even though i am an introvert, for the past year I have been trying to throw myself outside to get approached but it's just been crickets every time. (i go to places i actually enjoy ofc). I also prefer to always meet people in real life because i can't feel connection online at all. 
I think i only got approached once. It was at a coffee shop. We talked for a bit and exchanged contacts but never contacted each other but i didn't care. Other than him, 2 other men approached me but they were both old enough to be my dad. 

Anyways, here we are on reddit. I would've never wanted to be on reddit tbh but i was so tired of people not understanding me. It's normal for them to not understand me though. Because i don't think the normal person is as lonely as i am. I feel like people belittle me for getting upset that i'm not being loved by a man. But all i want is something that the average person has. God forbid a girl wants a basic human need. They just don't get what it's like to be so deprived. 
All i want is to feel like someone's girl. All i want is to be the average person. 
Currently crying while writing this :').

I’m 32M and a couple months ago I was supervising a 21F intern. We got along really well from the start she’s smart, funny, hardworking, and honestly a lot more mature than I expected. Over time we got closer. We grabbed coffee after work, texted outside office hours, and there was some harmless flirting that just felt natural, not forced.

Her internship recently ended, and she’s no longer working at my company. Yesterday we ended up sleeping together. It was completely consensual  she was comfortable, happy, and I’m not going to lie, it was amazing for both of us. There was no awkwardness in the moment and everything felt right.

But today I woke up with this weird guilt sitting in my head. I don’t know if it’s the age gap, the ex-professional boundary, or if I’m just overthinking. She’s an adult, she knew what she wanted, I didn’t manipulate her, and she wasn’t under my authority anymore when we slept together. 

At the same time, another part of me really likes her. Not “I’m in love” level, but I genuinely like her as a person. I want to see her again. She wants that too  she texted me this morning like everything is totally normal, while my brain is spinning.

I also want to help her get a good job somewhere else, because I do care about her future and I have contacts that could help. But I also don’t want to be that guy who abuses a dynamic or crosses boundaries, even unintentionally",4,1761111645.0,TrueOffMyChest,16,0.63,False

The White Paper explores the concept of Personal Carbon Allowances - investigating how it could work in practice, reviewing what a personal carbon allowance would include, and looking at how big a personal carbon allowance should be. It includes learning's and feedback from a four-week consumer trial in Great Britain which set a personal carbon allowance of 20Kg CO2 per day.

The qualitative findings of the study are fascinating. Consumers did act to reduce food waste and energy bills, but other areas, such as holidays and meat consumption, proved harder to address. There was genuine engagement and enthusiasm from the consumers who were involved.

 

The White Paper also explores the increasingly important role that business and brands have to play in driving awareness of sustainability and investigates whether personal carbon allowances could help consumers to understand how the carbon footprint of specific products and services relate to a total daily allowance. Providing easy-to-understand environmental information in a credible and relevant way is a significant challenge, but also an exciting opportunity.

The White Paper has been developed by The Carbon Trust, The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises.

* Flavor depth and control over brew strength
* Durability and maintenance over time

I am a woman in my mid 20’s, my friend is also a female. This friend and I have been pretty close, but also have had some bumps in the friendship (as MOST people do) but our problems have mostly revolved around her diagnosed bipolar disorder. She has been diagnosed bipolar since late high school, with a history of mania and catatonic episodes. I do not relate at all to her bipolar or manic episodes, and it seems to be holding me back. Don’t get me wrong I’ve felt deep empathy for her many years of my life and I care very much, but it’s getting to the point where I am overextending myself to her. She still is very dependent on her parents, financially, emotionally etc. She also struggles to keep jobs for more than maybe 2 months for years now. She’s always making excuses for not being able to do things in life because she has no money. She struggles to even pay for a meal or coffee and her parents enable her by sending her money. When she goes through her episodes, it’s very hard for anyone to deal with as I understand, but both of her parents push the problem onto me. She texts me all day complete nonsense, calls me multiple times a day, and her parents have even been driving her to my work without any notice. Many times I feel taken advantage by her, and just completely overwhelmed with everything that seems expected of me as a friend. Even in the times shes not going through an episode, her every day conversations with me are almost NEVER positive, and consist of her complaining about very simple things like it’s the end of the world. Is this friendship salvageable? or do I need to cut it out of my life completely?

I feel like so many shops (across multiple cities) are obsessed with this strange sterile white-wall look. I much prefer shops that have a homey, sit-and-stay-awhile kind of feeling to them. Shops where you can easily get work done but also just hang out, chat with people, relax a bit. I’m thinking old library, low lighting, wood paneled walls type of feeling.

For some examples of my favorite shops in town so far (for context I moved here two months ago so my selections are still limited, hence asking for recs): Ipsento 606, Cafe Mustache, New Wave, and the Brewed (I know the last one doesn’t fully fit but I like it). At least these are what I’m looking for more in the atmosphere of the shop, not necessarily the quality of the coffee.

The fact that millions of people fire up their personal pollution machines EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. and nobody bats an eye. But apparently, we’re all environmentalists now.

Let me break this down for you smoothing-brained commuters:
Your morning drive to work? Pollution. Your evening drive back? More pollution. That taxi you took to your friend’s birthday party across town? Pollution. The Uber to that restaurant you could’ve walked to in 15 minutes? Pollution. That weekend road trip for “self-care”? Congratulations, you just destroyed the environment for Instagram photos.

But sure, let’s all pretend this is fine because it’s “necessary.” Oh, you NEED your car? Really? Did humans just not exist before 1900? How did your great-grandparents survive without a Honda City? Must’ve been a miracle.

“But public transport is inconvenient!” Oh no! You might have to spend 20 extra minutes on a bus with other people! How will you survive without your personal AC bubble? Better pollute the air everyone breathes instead. Very considerate of you.

And the best part? You’re not even doing anything important with these vehicles. You’re driving to get coffee. You’re taking cabs to parties. You’re ordering delivery that travels 10 kilometers because you’re too lazy to cook. All of this, every single day, pumping toxic fumes into the same air you breathe, your kids breathe, everyone breathes.

But hey, at least you’re comfortable, right? Who cares if the AQI is in the “severe” category 300 days a year? That’s just normal life now.

So next time you’re sitting in traffic, engine running, AC blasting, scrolling through your phone complaining about pollution, remember: you’re not stuck in traffic. You ARE traffic. You’re not a victim of pollution. You’re the pollution.",0,1761110741.0,delhi,15,0.47,False
1oczr66,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1oczr66/open_relationship_emotional_advice/,Open relationship emotional advice,"My wife (34F) and I (29M) have been exploring the idea of an open relationship (UK if it matters). It was my idea, and at the minute it’s just her who is chatting and meeting with other people. This was my choice, mainly down to the fact I’m very body conscious, hate the way I look and anyone else seeing me like this. But that’s a different story. 

A bit of background. We have quite an interesting relationship. We have a few dynamics, the BDSM/control aspect, a DaddyDom/LittleGirl aspect. Which we both love. 

We started the open side at the weekend and found a few apps that seem to offer the best support for what we want. I helped her write her profile and pick some photos and quite quickly was well on her way to chatting with guys. She met a guy in Sunday for coffee and honestly I loved it. We talked about it after and the sex and connection has been fantastic for us both. 

My question is this; at times I feel horribly jealous, in a way a bit lonely (I don’t have many friends as I don’t believe in massive friend groups of people who don’t really care) and struggling with the shitty thoughts. Like “has the sex been amazing because of these guys?”   Which I know isn’t the case, the majority of guys are very cringey and way too forward sending private pictures etc. For those who do enjoy an open relationship, how do you control the feelings, the stupid thoughts that enter your head in the middle of the night, the jealousy etc? Is this normal? Or does it mean that this isn’t working? For the record I do enjoy this, again it was totally my idea and I do want it to continue for both of our benefits. Any suggestions?

1oczqrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oczqrq/the_bugs_are_everywhere/,The Bugs Are Everywhere,"Saturday morning I woke up with a plan- finally selling the bottles that we had in the alley.

My apartment is a massive house that looks like it was sectioned off into apartments; as a result, we have a tiny alley that leads to nowhere but acts as a buffer between the small house next door. We tossed our bags of empty bottles there- out of sight, out of mind.

I get dressed and put on some gloves, and wear my boots because it has rained several times in the last few weeks, so mud will be inevitable. I walk outside, and the sun is bright. I walk past the laundry room and get ready to start pulling bags. 

I had to move some cardboard out of the way. I lifted several bags when I noticed some bugs. ""No big deal"", I thought. Then came the next bag, and I was horrified. It looked like millions of ispod-looking bugs, earwigs, snails, slugs, spiders- all crawling and moving away. I was shocked and dropped one of the bags back onto them. I quickly moved away and decided my fiancé could deal with that another time. But I couldn't shake that itchy feeling you get after seeing the crawling.

I ripped open bags and started sorting. Cans and bottles were sorted from white 13-gallon bags to the giant black 33-gallon bags.  The occasional earwig or pillbug spilling out of the cans. Each time, I felt more unsettled. Then came the spiders. These were not daddy long-leg spiders; they didn't look harmless, and they were fast. I saw one start crawling out of a can, and I jumped up back and stepped on it- can and all. This continued for the next half hour while I tore and sorted, tore and sorted bag after bag. My hands began to shake, and I could tell my body was tired of feeling fear after each bug it saw. I tried to ignore them and keep going, but I had to take a break. I went back inside and washed my hands. I couldn't feel clean. 

I reasoned with myself that once the bags were mostly gone, the bugs and slugs would go away. I closed my eyes to take a big, deep breath, but my mind pictured the scene again: Lift the bag, stare at the swarm of bugs all crawling around, and drop the bag. Was it possible to get PTSD from bugs? I didn't want to leave the house, but I had two white bags to finish. I somehow powered through and speed-ran the rest of the process: put the black bags in the car, drive to the recycling center, sell them, then drive home. I laid in bed and couldn't help but feel so unclean. ""I need to shower"", I thought to myself. 

I grabbed a towel and headed for the bathroom. I put my towel on the rack, and I saw a bug out of the corner of my eye. Not proud to say that my heart dropped to my ass, and the adrenaline spike was crazy. I quickly looked over and it was just a hair dye stain from three weeks ago. ""God, hold it together, lady"", I thought as I held my chest as if holding my heart steady.  

I loved the cold water on my face, but the second I closed my eyes, the scene went on a loop. Lift the bag, stare at the swarm of bugs all crawling around, and drop the bag. Lift the bag, stare at the swarm of bugs all crawling around, and drop the bag. I faced the other way and washed my hair instead. I stepped out of the shower and stepped on something. I was disgusted and wiggled my foot- a hair tie. I was frustrated that I let this get to me so badly. 

My fiancé was home and asked me what I had been up to. I told him the story, and instead of saying something endearing, he said, ""Why were you sorting the cans? I told you we would get my cousin to help"". 

""Oh yeah, and then we would be overtaken by the bugs"", I said sarcastically- I think. 

We decided to go to Denny's, ""Ol' Reliable"", and get food. I must have had a real thousand-yard stare because my fiancé asked me what was wrong. ""The bugs, I keep picturing it"".  Lift the bag, stare at the swarm of bugs all crawling around, and drop the bag. 

Throughout the day, I tried to keep myself busy at home and not think about the swarm just around the corner. I sorted my clothes for laundry and took the first load into the laundry room. There was a bug on the wall that I did see and tried to avoid by distancing myself from it. The bug didn't move and had been there for weeks, but still unnerved me. I had to go back into that room maybe three more times, and each time I looked over to make sure it didn't move. 

By nighttime, I felt mentally exhausted. I felt on edge the whole day, and when I tried to close my eyes, the memory kept replaying.  Lift the bag, stare at the swarm of bugs all crawling around, and drop the bag. I opened my eyes and really thought about why I was terrified. 

I remembered when I was just a little girl playing with Barbies. I still remember the clean smell of the old apartment. My mom's favorite color was brown, so the couch, throw pillows, and carpet all followed a coffee color scheme. I sat by the sliding glass door, blinds shut, and it was my background for the story I had conceived for my lesbian Barbies. I had been playing for less than 10 minutes and getting my props set up when something fell on my head. I tried to shake my head, but I felt like it was still on me. I tilted my head and moved my hair- a giant cockroach fell off my head. It must have been an inch long, but for tiny me, it might as well have been 6 inches long. I immediately stood up and moved away. I grabbed my Barbies and moved the studio I had so intricately set up to my mom's room. I never played by the sliding glass door again. I don't know why that memory soothed me and helped me fall asleep without thinking of the day's events. Maybe I was reminding myself that at least the bugs weren't on me. 

My fiance and I cleaned the house thoroughly. I am avoiding the alley like the plague. Occasionally, I see a bug in my peripheral, and every time I look over it, is my mind playing tricks on me. I don't know how long this will go on, I just hope this stops. Everywhere I go, I see them. I thought I was getting better and forgetting about it, but just today, a strand of hair fell on my arm and I freaked out. I stood up and began shaking my arms and brushing away what I thought was a spider. The memory started again in my head: Lift the bag, stare at the swarm of bugs all crawling around, and drop the bag.  I fear that no matter how clean the apartment is, they will find a way inside. They will get me, I don't know how, but they will. ",2,1761110662.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1oczqpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1oczqpo/my_husband_wants_to_make_real_friends_am_i_the/,"My Husband Wants to Make Real Friends, am I the Asshole if I Care that it’s a Girl?","I (36F) have been together with my husband (38M) since I was 17. Making acquaintances and friends was always much easier for him. It took me years to learn that I would sometimes put energy into nice and really good people, only to learn I wasn’t really a priority for them. Real friends can be hard to come by. I did make a few over the years, albeit not perfect in reliability at times. 

We’ve had marital issues for a few years now. I was parentified as a kid in a large family, and subsequently had my own children with him, getting pregnant at 18, we made the best of it. I never had a period in my life of focusing on just me or really experiencing childhood like things. My parents were alcoholics and I got left out of a LOT of things because I had to babysit, cook, and clean. Camping, hikes, giving up after school clubs and sleepovers, etc. It took me the better part of a decade to even be calm around people who were drinking alcohol. All of this contributed a lot to my diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. I’m also diagnosed with Bipolar Type II. I am taking medication for that and have actively seen therapists for it. I understand a good portion of the struggles my husband has had with me for years, and have been working my damndest on improving myself. My mental issues aren’t an excuse for my behavior and actions, just an extra hurdle I get to deal with every single day that is exhausting. I can’t even imagine or grasps how unreliable I am as a partner to my husband. 

Over the years he never really seemed to care to make any other deep true friendships than one childhood friend (whom has been long distance the majority of our relationship) 

He says I’ve been very controlling. That I’d ‘punish’ him whenever he tried to make friends. 

I would have really bad anxiety and panic attacks sometimes when he left the house to go hangout without me coming along, and it was drinking with friends, or something fun like fishing or hiking. I would do the usual- stay at home to watch our children. Not great when I already had some major fomo going on. 

He normally tries to include me on a lot of things though. I struggled a lot since he worked out of town, traveling for work being gone several days to about a week at a time. Staying and working inside what I deemed as very nice hotels, since that’s where the job was. I was lucky enough to travel with him when our kids were toddlers about 2 times. I had never been to other cities like that before. Hell, even going to get fast food was a massive treat for me! I couldn’t go with him when the kids were in school however. Our kids are much older now, 10, and two older teenagers. Traveling for work was and is hard on both of us in our own ways. I felt a semblance of envy that he at least got to sleep by himself at night; no baby to nurse or little ones wetting the bed or getting sick. We’d miss each other terribly. 

Moving on, we made friends with another couple last year. We have gone to several concerts together, spent a weekend away, coffee dates, and so on. I feel as if I’m living life backwards in a fun way! He dove in deep while I stayed more wary and took things as they came happily. He was extra kind and sweet to them in front of me at times and I was hurt. Because it was stuff I wanted from him too. I felt like a back burner of a person in so many areas, and to my husband as well. I idolized him for years. I just wanted to be treated kindly and deserve patience too, and maybe receive just a little bit more because I’m his wife. I brought this up to him. 

In the end, he was too pushy for their liking and hurt their feelings. Expecting too much too soon. Too eager for real connection which he craved and feels starved for for years. They saw some ugly and petty behavior from him towards me in person and their perspectives changed. He knows he fucked up badly, and it’s not the first time he’s said some very hurtful things like that to me. I’m worried I’m going to do a bad job representing him in this post. There’s a lot of truly great, wonderful, and some sadly negative qualities I can list that all equate to the person he is. I also feel taken for granted sometimes. 

We’re still actively working on how we’ve had bad communication habits forming for years. Are waiting to hear back from a couples therapist, as we really love each other and want the other to be happy. I know my mental issues add a huge problem to it all. It sucks. A lot. He feels alone and isolated and I can barely get a grip on myself. Bouncing from periods of extreme productivity to depressive non-activity. 

The problem I have, is he “doesn’t want to be limited by gender.” I feel it’s blind to not recognize how I might feel if he makes really good friends with another woman. If he would have long talks with her, go have a beer with her, do friend things with her one on one. I’d be wondering and wishing why that girl wasn’t me? It makes me feel irate and grief. You’ve no idea how much I want him to have that kind of comfort in life. How much it hurts as his partner that he feels he can’t talk to me and will clam up. I would feel okay if it were a guy friend, I wouldn’t feel abandoned. 

I said I would need some time to get to know her first. In time I could be comfortable with him and his (female) friend going on a coffee date to talk. There’s a few girls I can think of I’d feel somewhat comfortable with already, but they’re more my friends than his. I’m told I have trust issues, yes, I know this. It’s not healthy but I can’t snap my fingers and make the feelings go away. 

Personally, I also want him to be the guy in my life I talk to the most. The one I hang out with the most, and go get a beer with. It’d feel kind of weird if I did these things with other guys and not even include him. I know this is my own expectation and morals, and I shouldn’t expect him to practice the same things as me. 

He gave examples of the random hangouts he’s had with a neighbor friend of ours, and I said I’d feel differently if you did those same hangouts with that neighbor’s girlfriend. He doesn’t see why it should matter. 

I don’t feel threatened at him cheating on me. At all. I feel threatened in that I will no longer be a person he can or will want to talk to or hang out with anymore. I’ll still be the woman he loves, but maybe doesn’t like me enough to want to be around with part of the time. I desperately wish I could produce a person that’d provide him the comfort he deserves and needs. Especially because he can’t always rely on me with my BPD and BD2. I’d secretly wish that person was me out of both jealousy and envy, but that’s not realistic maybe…I would also feel uncomfortable if that person who comforted him so much in life and give him the sense of autonomy was another woman…

Am I wrong to feel uncomfortable with the idea of him having a female best friend? To ask this of him? 

———-

Extra info: we’re both Bisexual. I’ve known this about me since I was a kid, he only learned this about himself earlier in the year. I wasn’t surprised and feel no differently other than happy he’s learning more about himself. 

We’ve also had a 4-some with another couple a few times. It felt more like polyamory? He and I are still worried about “Us”. These issues I’ve had with him before we opened our marriage. They aren’t connected in my mind, I think he views it differently. 

————

TL;DR I feel uncomfortable with my husband making best friends with women atm because I feel threatened they might replace my role in his life. Not in a romantic way, but friendship way. He doesn’t think gender should matter. I suffer from BPD and BD2. ",0,1761110657.0,marriageadvice,0,0.33,False

The night was heavy with silence, the kind that presses against your ears and makes every creak of the house feel like a warning. I, Evelyn, a novelist of horror stories with only a scattering of devoted readers, had grown accustomed to the solitude of my small, creaky home on the outskirts of town. My days were spent weaving tales of dread, but nothing in my imagination could have prepared me for what transpired that night.

I had fallen asleep at my desk, the glow of my laptop screen long since dimmed, my latest manuscript—a half-finished tale of a haunted village—still open. The clock on the wall ticked past midnight, its rhythm a faint heartbeat in the stillness. I stirred in my sleep, my neck stiff from the awkward angle, when a sound pierced the quiet. It was soft at first, almost imperceptible, like the distant sob of a child lost in the wind. But as I blinked awake, the sound grew clearer, more insistent. It was not a child’s cry. It was deeper, raw, and guttural—a sound that clawed at the edges of my nerves.

I sat upright, my heart thudding against my ribcage. The room was dark, save for the faint moonlight filtering through the curtains, casting long, skeletal shadows across the floor. The cry came again, unmistakable now, echoing from somewhere within the house. My first instinct was to dismiss it as a dream, a remnant of the macabre worlds I crafted in my stories. But the sound was too real, too visceral. It was not the wind, not the house settling, not my imagination. Someone—or something—was in my home.

I rose from my chair, my bare feet cold against the hardwood floor. The air felt thick, as though it carried a weight I could not see. I grabbed the flashlight from my desk drawer, its beam cutting through the darkness as I stepped cautiously into the hallway. The crying grew louder, more desperate, emanating from the direction of the living room. My pulse quickened, but curiosity, that dangerous trait of every writer, urged me forward. I told myself it was nothing—a stray animal, perhaps, or a neighbor in distress. Yet the primal part of my mind whispered warnings I could not ignore.

The living room was shrouded in shadow, the furniture reduced to vague silhouettes. The crying stopped abruptly as I crossed the threshold, leaving only the oppressive silence. My flashlight swept the room, illuminating the worn sofa, the cluttered coffee table, the bookshelves lined with my novels and those of authors far more successful. Nothing seemed out of place. I exhaled, my breath visible in the chilly air, and turned to leave.

That was when I saw him.

In the corner of the room, where the shadows were deepest, stood a figure. He was enormous, his silhouette filling the space with an unnatural presence. His shoulders were broad, his frame towering, far larger than any man I had ever seen. The flashlight trembled in my hand as I aimed the beam at him, revealing details that made my stomach churn. His face was grotesque, a malformed parody of humanity—his eyes too large, too wet, glistening like pools of ink in the light. His mouth was a jagged slash, twisted in a way that suggested both pain and something far worse. His skin was pallid, stretched taut over bones that seemed to protrude at unnatural angles.

He was crying. The sound resumed, a low, keening wail that seemed to come from deep within his chest. His massive hands, gnarled and claw-like, clutched at his face as though trying to hide himself from my gaze. I stood frozen, my mind racing to make sense of what I was seeing. This was no intruder, no human. This was something else, something that did not belong in my world.

And then he spoke.

“Mother,” he rasped, his voice a guttural whisper that sent a shiver down my spine. His head turned slowly, his eyes locking onto mine. They were filled with a desperate, almost childlike need, but there was something else there too—something dark, something hungry. “Mother, why did you leave me?”

I stumbled backward, my flashlight slipping from my grasp and clattering to the floor. The beam spun wildly, casting erratic shadows that made the room seem alive with movement. My voice caught in my throat, unable to form words. I wanted to scream, to demand who he was, what he was, but all I could do was stare as he took a step toward me. His movements were jerky, unnatural, as though his body were a puppet controlled by unsteady hands.

“I… I’m not your mother,” I managed to choke out, my voice barely above a whisper. My hands fumbled behind me, searching for the wall, for anything to anchor myself against the rising tide of terror.

He tilted his head, his expression shifting into something almost sorrowful. “You made me,” he said, his voice cracking with emotion. “You wrote me. You left me here.”

My mind reeled. Wrote him? The words made no sense, yet they struck a chord deep within me, a primal fear that I could not name. I was a writer, yes, but my stories were fiction—creations of my mind, not flesh and blood. This thing, this abomination, could not be real. And yet, here he was, standing in my living room, calling me Mother.

I turned to run, my instincts finally overriding my shock. My feet pounded against the floor as I fled toward the hallway, my only thought to reach the front door, to escape into the night. But he was faster—impossibly so. I felt a cold, iron grip close around my ankle, yanking me backward with a force that sent me crashing to the ground. The impact knocked the breath from my lungs, and pain shot through my body as my head struck the hardwood. The world spun, the shadows blurring into a kaleidoscope of darkness.

I twisted, clawing at the floor, desperate to break free. His hand was like a vice, unyielding, his strength unnatural. I looked up, my vision swimming, and saw him looming over me. His face was closer now, his features even more grotesque in the dim light. His eyes bored into mine, filled with a mix of anguish and accusation.

“Mother,” he whispered again, his voice trembling. “Don’t leave me again.”

I screamed, the sound tearing from my throat as I kicked and thrashed, but his grip only tightened. The cold of the floor seeped into my skin, and the weight of his presence pressed down on me, suffocating. I was trapped, alone in my own home with a creature that called me its creator, its mother. And as the darkness closed in, I realized with a sickening clarity that this was no dream, no story I could rewrite. This was real, and it had only just begun.

1ocznqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1ocznqu/temporarily_surviving_off_caffeine_crashes/,Temporarily surviving off caffeine crashes?,"Caffeine usually (99% of the time) makes me tired instead of giving me energy.

But on one night I drank two cups of coffee (I drink coffee to help me take dumps because I have always suffered with constipation no matter what I eat), and then followed a few hours later I drank a 20oz Red Bull for whatever reason.

Maybe an hour or so after finishing that can of Red Bull I suddenly felt horrible and it was the feeling of extreme hunger/low blood sugar, so I grabbed two small dark chocolate chip peanut butter bars and a protein yogurt drink and it absolutely made me feel better, and a little bit afterwards from recovery I suddenly had energy and I was able to finally get my brain working for quite a while. (this was like 6am)

My theory from that experience and from hearing of others is that possibly even though normal caffeine isn't enough for me, if I get to a certain limit I can ""crash"", and then eat and my brain will finally work with caffeine and I have the ability to focus.

Due to personal issues I haven't been able to get refill medication for the past few months, so I've been living off of spare/leftover Adderall (but there's a reason I dropped it)

I don't remember where or what exactly it said but I remember reading something to the effect about needing to reach a certain limit/or have a caffeine crash before you actually start feeling the energetic effects of caffeine.

I decided to buy a two boxes of energy shots which contain slightly more caffeine than what that Red Bull contained, and now I'm going to see if I can replicate it and possibly use it to my advantage, it may not be healthy but honestly nothing in my life is- why even bother.

The numbers in the left column of the images are how many games I chose that relic / how many times my game ended with at least one copy of that card in my deck.

The information provided here is only useful for people who struggle to get wins at all and whose only goal is to get wins; if you intend to be an A20H player I would advise you view this post as ""impressive and interesting"" but not as ""good advice on how to play"".



Boss Relic Swap

I never take this option for anyone but Silent. I deem the starting bonuses of the other three characters too helpful in the early game to merit it.

Before this I would have guessed I take this option on Silent about 25% of the time, but in this streak I ended up taking it 50% of the time with 5 of my Silent runs being Boss Relic Swaps. I received Fusion Hammer, Black Star, Philo Stone, Coffee Dripper, and Sozu. I did not include any of these 5 in the above image for Boss Relics obtained; that image only includes the 20 Boss Relics that I personally selected.

1oczjeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oczjeq/aio_for_being_upset_that_the_man_i_have_always/,AIO for being upset that the man I have always thought was my soulmate told me it’s about time he proposed to his girlfriend?,"Okay here we go (spoiler- there’s a chance I’m crazy)

I met the man that I believe  my soulmate in college. We were neighbors our sophomore year and because of that of friend groups overlapped. 

As soon as I met him, I had this deep-rooted feeling that he was my soulmate. Within a few conversations, I knew him, his heart, and his view on life. I had this real feeling that I was meant to be with him forever, but I felt no pressure or stress about it.

The next two years of college, we hung out in our friend group together and gravitated towards each other at every event. If we were in the same room, we were gonna be together and we were gonna be  laughing. I have never felt such a natural or deep connection to someone. There’s nothing you could tell me about him that would shock me or that I haven’t sensed myself. 

Throughout college, We both dated other people, and I didn’t feel weird about it because I thought it was healthy and fun. We were meant to be together, so it was normal and fun to date other people while we were so young. We also always checked in with the other at bars before going home with someone else. I know that sounds weird and I can’t explain it, but that was our practice. If we were leaving the bar alone, we would always ask the other to walk us home.

We only hooked up once and it was a make out our senior year that ended in us not having sex but sleeping in my bed together. We woke up the next morning, didn’t address the make out, had coffee, had breakfast and overall spent the whole day together having fun. We didn’t ever address the kiss it, just moved on with our relationship as normal. 

After college, we did not see each other as often (due to living/working in towns an hour apart), but it just didn’t phase me, because I deeply felt (and feel) that we were meant to be together, so it was normal to explore and spend our early twenties apart. Whenever we saw each other, we were inseparable and our conversations were so deep, but we didn’t pursue anything further. I loved that. It made me feel independent but secure at the same time.

Due to a new job, I moved to a city a plane flight away from him. We didn’t communicate much, but every time he was in my city for work (about once a quarter), he’d take me out, and it was like nothing had changed. It has always felt so easy, relaxed, and unpressured with him. 

Last year, I moved back to his city and found out he had a girlfriend, who he’d been dating for about 6 months. Again, we have both had partners throughout our relationship, so I didn’t feel upset upon hearing this. We hadn’t seen each other in about year since I moved back, so when I finally saw him (two weeks ago), they’d been dating for about two years.

When we saw each (random run in at a coffee shop) we spent a longgg time catching up.  It was as 
easy and lovely as expected. He told he that he had been seeing this woman for about while now, and that it was about time that he proposed to her. I congratulated him, we hugged, and moved on. I have. Been absolutely tanked by the fact that he’s gonna propose to this woman. But also, I still feel like we’re meant to be together. Maybe he’ll marry her, maybe he won’t, but I still feel that we are endgame. 

I have also been dating a man for 6 months now (and really do love him), but still feel that I’m lifelong meant to be with college boy. I genuinely cannot stress enough how deeply I feel that we’re  meant to be together and how little stress I feel towards our timeline of getting together.

My question is, is this gut feeling that I have absolutely psychotic??? Or am I genuinely meant to be with this man? I’ve never felt so calm and yet so confident about something in my life? I feel no rush in being with him because I feel absolutely certain that it’ll happen. I’ve never felt this way about anyone else I’ve dated despite now being 31 and having 3 long term relationships in my rear view. 

Please advise! Should I check myself into a mental facility? Or am I just that in tune with my future reality?

1oczej2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawStudentsPH/comments/1oczej2/law_school_advice_for_a_working_student/,LAW SCHOOL ADVICE FOR A WORKING STUDENT,"Heyy everyone! 👋 So, first-time poster here (please be kind, haha). I’m a 23-year-old licensed MedTech, but somewhere along my journey, I realized medicine wasn’t where my heart truly belonged.

I remember back in third year, while everyone else was buried in lab works and diagnostics, I caught myself daydreaming—not about hospitals or white coats—but about microphones, people, and policies. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been drawn to public speaking, service, and the messy-but-beautiful world of politics. Maybe it’s because I grew up in a tough home and saw up close how hard it is to live in this country. I’ve joined several volunteer organizations since then, and every single time, something inside me whispers, *“This is where you’re meant to be.”*

If I were wiser back then, I probably would’ve taken Mass Comm or PolSci instead of MedTech. But hey, the past already did its part. 😂

Fast forward to now—I’m a digital nomad! I travel, work from home, and live on coffee and deadlines. But lately, I’ve been thinking of settling down next year and finally taking the leap: **law school.**

Here’s the thing, though. I’ve talked to friends who are juggling work and law school, and they said the readings are… *brutal* (as in, caffeine and tears level). So now I’m left with a few burning questions for you, future lawyers and current law students out there:

1. Is it *really* possible to work full-time and attend law school at night? (The school I’m eyeing offers evening classes.)
2. As a MedTech grad, will my background affect my standing in law school?
3. And lastly, does your law school make a huge difference in the bar exam, or is it mostly about the student’s own grit and discipline?

Would love to hear your insights! Help this lost soul find her way to justice, haha. ⚖️",4,1761109485.0,LawStudentsPH,14,0.75,False
1ocze91,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ocze91/my_family_seems_to_think_i_have_a_lot_of_money/,My family seems to think I have a lot of money,"It’s exhausting, honestly. Just because I work hard and don’t constantly complain about bills doesn’t mean I’m secretly rich. They see me buy myself something small, a coffee, a dress, a little trip, and suddenly I’m the “well-off” one. What they don’t see are the sacrifices behind it, the late nights, the anxiety over making ends meet, the quiet moments of guilt when I spend anything on myself. It hurts when your family treats you like a walking wallet instead of a person. I love helping when I can, but it’s never enough, and when I say no, I’m suddenly “selfish” or “changing.” Sometimes I wish they understood that I’m just trying to survive too. I’m not living lavishly… I’m just trying to give myself a life that doesn’t constantly feel like struggle.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761108752.0,penspin,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I’m almost finished my treatment, and my ortho said that I should continue wearing my last tray for a few weeks before my next appointment where I will be scanned for retainers. He said that I could go straight to nighttime wear after the two weeks of full time wear on my last tray are complete. This is in part to hopefully help my bite settle, as I developed a bit of an open bite during treatment. This all sounds good to me, but I see on here that most people seem to be wearing their retainers full time for several months after treatment. I know this is technically my last tray, and not a retainer, but does this sound safe?

Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Hanoi – We’re here for the chaos, coffee, and charm. Where’s the best place to grab authentic egg coffee and street pho that hits different?
Sapa – The misty mountains are calling! Any cozy spots with scenic views (and fewer tourists)? Bonus if we can meet locals or try traditional home meals.
Ninh Binh – Planning a boat ride, but open to anything offbeat—hidden caves, countryside cafes, or sunset viewpoints that make you go “wow.”
Da Nang – We heard the beaches are unreal! Any secret sunset bars, night markets, or underrated foodie spots?Hoi An – Looking for that fairy-tale lantern energy! Also—best tailor recs and street food plz.
Ba Na Hills – Golden Bridge, yes—but what else should we not miss while we’re there?
Phu Quoc – Ending the trip island style. Hidden beaches, seafood joints, or romantic sunset bars? Drop them all!We’re open to random detours, weird foods, and all things fun. Basically, if it’s something locals swear by but tourists often skip — that’s exactly what we want!So Vietnam pros, drop your hot takes, secret finds, and foodie gospel below.

I don't usually like vanilla because a lot of what I've smelled is really gourmand and too sweet/something I've already smelled before. And although being goth doesn't mean I can't like sweeter/gourmand fragrance it's never been my thing and never felt like me. After trying out Montale's Intense Cafe (although the rose is more prominent that the coffee and vanilla) it was so strong and beautiful I couldn't believe I liked it. And trying to curate my future collection I actually want a goth vanilla.. So what are some alluring and potent dark vanillas that I should try, I'm open to anything, smokey vanillas, dirtier vanillas, warm vanillas, cold vanillas, gourmandish too but especially non gourmand, unique vanillas that aren't TOO green, but whatever is good. Maybe something that also has tonka/coffee/tuberose and rose as well but as long as the vanilla is stronger.. or incense-y. I can't decide. But like I said I'm open to whatever as long as it lasts forever, and has incredible sillage because I want it to last for eternity and project for eternity.

Hello, I'm a relatively healthy 17 year old girl and about a year ago, last August, I got food poisoning and/or a stomach bug from a local café. I was out of commission for about a week but seemed relatively fine after. However, I began to throw up very frequently after eating things that were regular to my diet. Prior to this, I only threw up about roughly once a year whenever I formed a migraine so this was extremely out of the ordinary. Months go by and I ultimately notice that I only got sick after drinking coffees so I stopped, assuming that I had formed an intolerance to it after having it so frequently. Some  time goes by and in June I swing by a 7/11 to get a dr pepper slurpy which is something I regularly consumed. It ended up making me sick but I assumed it was because I had a large and the caffeine must've equated to a cup of coffee or something (I'm not really sure how solid that reasoning was, I was lowkey in denial). I take the experience with a grain of salt. Soon after, in July, I was out and thirsty and the only available beverage was a pepsi. I knew I probably wasn't supposed to drink it but did with caution and drank about half. To my slight suprise I ended up being completely fine. It wasn't until about two days later when I decided to try my luck again and had a bit of coke or rootbeer, I don't exactly remember which but it made me extremely sick. After that I completely accepted that I had a caffeine intolerance and stayed away from anything that could potentially make me sick. I had about a month of reprive until the nausea and vomiting returned full force. I began to get sick after eating seemingly random foods such as quesdillas, chili, a bag of cheetos, a breakfast ham and cheese combo from burger king, a whopper ALSO from burger king (not sure if it's me or their meats at this point...) etc. It's now October and whatever this is seems to be getting worse. I'm nauseous 3+ nights of the week (which I'm not sure if this helps but I only vomit at night) and it's beginning to take a toll on my mental health. Even on days where I don't feel sick, I'm extremely paranoid about it and have stopped eating in fear of throwing up. I'm losing hours of sleep each night psyching myself out and convincing myself that I'm gonna vomit. I visited the radiologist today and did a barium swallow where they told me everything seems to be in order and scheduled me for an endoscopy next month. I'm hoping they'll be able to give me any kind of diagnosis then but with college around the corner and plans to move states away from home I'm terrified that this is something I'll just have to suffer from forever. I've had countless visits to the doctor where they have already ruled out celiacs disease and other illnesses that I can't currently remember but things that can be caught through bloodwork. I'm currently on meclizine and some daily laxatives which has stopped the vomiting for now but the nausea lingers. I'm just so tired and drained, I feel like absolute crap nearly everyday and just want some answers.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’m pretty taken aback as it has to be pretty aggressive to make your coworkers this uncomfortable as the coworker and I don’t talk. 
This is at a coffee shop. This is pretty new behavior and hasn’t happened to this extent before. 

We’ve been together for three years now, live together, discussing future. To be honest things have gotten pretty rough recently. The last three months have been hard, I’ve been pretty career focused and perhaps wasn’t giving as much attention to the relationship as I should. She brought this up to me and seemed to have one foot out. Things have gotten better, I’ve stepped up to all of the areas she said she needed, but it’s felt like a losing battle. Things have been better but it still feels pretty empty. I’ve had quite the gut feeling that something else has been going on for the past few months. I’ve never been able to confirm but this just kinda reinforces that feeling. This just kinda feels like a final blow where if this is what other people are seeing, what else is going on. I haven’t discussed this with her, I don’t want to bring in the message and cause drama in their workplace and mostly just want to keep the coworker anonymous. I feel like this relationship is a feeling of comfort for her at this point.

Mostly due to rejection-sensitivity resulting from ADHD (that trait has gone away with meds I started taking 5-ish weeks ago), compounded with a rough rejection when I was 17.

I met her on Tinder. She's a single mom to a 3 year old daughter, she is originally from Malta. She works 9-5, and it's quite a stressful job ... she's into Anime, upcycling, she's got purple hair too. By far, she is the nicest soul I ever been out with. She's quirky in the best way, Very pretty. We a really good date on Saturday, I was so proud of it ... I made a few gaffes here and there, I'm only human, I was nervous (!!!). First got coffee, then for a walk in nature ... then food, got as far as kissing her. She indicated heavily that there would be a ""next time"".

I know waiting a while before cementing the next time is not recommended by any stretch. We toyed around with a few ideas though ... look, she doesn't want to see me again for the foreseeable. Apparently nothing to do with me ... it's her life currently, obviously very stretched ... works full time, has a kid. I may have been a bit too pushy with my conversation to her ... it was a bit full-on, though I feared it going a milktoast, a little dry toward the end. She's indicated that she likes me a lot, and wants to keep in touch ... but she says she doesn't think she can commit to anyone else right now.

I appreciate her doing what she gotta do for her child, that kid HAS to come first. But I can't help feel a little melancholy. I felt a lot of potential was there.

1ocyy6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ocyy6x/the_internship_that_ate_my_friends_alive/,The Internship That Ate My Friends Alive,"I can’t tell you the name of the bank. Legally, I’m not allowed to. But if you’ve ever worked in finance, you’ve probably brushed shoulders with it. It’s the kind of place that recruits fresh grads with promises of “leadership pipelines” and “fast-track programs.” That’s how they got me—hungry, ambitious, and too naïve to see the teeth behind the smile.  

At first, it looked like any other corporate internship. Long hours, endless spreadsheets, coffee runs that weren’t in the job description. But my manager—let’s call him Mr. H—had a way of slipping in tasks that didn’t make sense.  

“Stay late tonight,” he’d say, “and help me with the vault.”  

I thought he meant paperwork. Instead, he handed me a flashlight and a keycard and told me to go down into the sub-basement. The air was damp, metallic. The walls hummed like they were alive. My job was to count the safety deposit boxes, one by one, and whisper the numbers into the dark.  

I laughed at first, thinking it was some hazing ritual. But when I hesitated, Mr. H’s smile dropped. “Do it,” he said. His voice wasn’t loud, but it carried a weight that pressed against my chest.  

That was the first night I heard the scratching.  

It came from inside the walls, like nails dragging across steel. I told myself it was rats, but the sound followed me, box to box, until I was whispering numbers so fast my throat burned. When I came back upstairs, pale and shaking, Mr. H just nodded. “Good. They like you.”  

I should’ve quit then.  

But the thing about corporate life is that it conditions you to obey. You tell yourself it’s just temporary, just part of paying your dues. And besides, my friends in the program were going through the same thing. Or so I thought.  

One by one, they started to change.  

Carla stopped sleeping. She’d show up with bloodshot eyes, muttering about “balancing the books” even when she wasn’t near a computer. Nate started scratching at his arms until they bled, whispering about “debts that can’t be repaid.” And Kristen—God, Kristen—she smiled too wide, her teeth grinding as if she was chewing something invisible.  

I asked her once what was happening. She leaned close and whispered, “The bank doesn’t just take money. It takes pieces of us. Interest, compounding daily.”  

I thought she was joking. Until she didn’t come back the next day.  

Mr. H said she’d been “transferred.” But when I went down to the sub-basement again, I saw her ID badge lying on the floor, half-melted into the concrete.  

The tasks got worse. Carrying sealed envelopes into rooms that didn’t exist on the floor plan. Sitting in pitch-black conference rooms while voices whispered numbers in languages I didn’t understand. Once, I was told to stand inside the vault with the door closed, “just to see how long you can last.”  

I lasted seven minutes before I started screaming.  

That was when I realized: this wasn’t hazing. This wasn’t training. This was feeding.  

The bank was alive.  

It fed on us—our fear, our sanity, our obedience. And Mr. H wasn’t a manager. He was a handler.  

I don’t know how I got out. One night, after another “assignment,” I just… walked. I didn’t pack my things. I didn’t say goodbye. I left my badge on the desk and ran until my lungs burned.  

Some of my friends weren’t so lucky. They’re still there, I think. Or what’s left of them is.  

Sometimes, late at night, I hear the scratching again.

1ocyxxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/USNewsHub/comments/1ocyxxd/on_the_choice_of_priorities_destroying_america/,On the Choice of Priorities Destroying America,"Trump shreds our Constitution and collapses our friendships, alliances, economy, and future, and you’re focused on this insignificant “woke” stuff. Is that you? We need to talk. Please, let’s have a beer, coffee, whatever. You are with a fellow citizen and friend, so you can relax. Thank you for your trust. Yes, you can lie back. There’s a button outside the right arm. Close your eyes. Count your breaths. Feel yourself fluid, able easily to shift your form and leave your old self behind. Count down to zero, starting ten, nine, eight, seven, six…

Six might be about right. Trump’s appeal is that he is an attractive adult with a toddler’s emotions and lack of reasoning and socialization skills. His reaction to the No Kings protests was an infantile, vulgar, grotesquely offensive embarrassment — nothing any President in our great history would ever have done. The world despises and laughs at us for it, already hating us for his devastating trade policies, distrusting us for his lies and betrayals.

Trump’s core, unfortunately, loves that exact sort of childish emotional venting. It is what has them hooked. With Trump, it’s always about making insults, never about policy. The core MAGA supporters don’t care what Trump does, as long as he becomes a conduit for and forgives the release of their deepest, darkest repressed thoughts and desires, which include sadistic vengeance, particularly against those classes and types they despise for the offense of being different, including the those of other races or creeds, the artistically gifted, the scientific experts, historians, academics and intellectuals of any sort, including many local educators, even cousins and siblings and essentially anyone who hasn’t fallen for the MAGA hate spell and its disinformation stream.

Most of us learn as children to see and respect the “other.” Trump didn’t and couldn’t: he shows all signs of having a dysfunctional prefrontal cortex — mood swings, changes of mind on a whim, angry, wandering speech, unusual social interactions, vulgarity, no capacity for planning.

He has people for all that. He’s the money and direction man with his mysterious credit lines and big Russian clients and sponsors, casino involvements, his 4500+ personal and business lawsuits, legendary criminal defense attorneys and related enticements and enforcers. He’s a spoiled adult with a child’s understanding of the world. It’s an infectious act, though, as it demeans others in a way that appeals to a type, his core.

A mental child with adult billionaire grifter powers, he has released his inner demons, the kind most of us learn to repress and banish as toddlers, and it feels great. He’s released them in MAGA, too. They have been programmed to bypass learned socialization skills and capacities. Through Trump they can vent all their hate at whatever target appeals to their own demons. That divides us. See detailed descriptions of “Beezlebub.” See Stoicism vs. Nero.

Being a Christian of a sort, I love Creation as we find it and know it best to work in cooperation with and not against it. That is the way of thinking that used to unite us. It includes permitting others their pursuits so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of other others, lol. It implies a respect for the sensibilities of others  differing views and tastes. That goes in all directions.

My freedoms include, as will those of my offspring, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear, so help me, God. That means I’m going to help stop Trump, MAGA, and Project 2025 by every legal means I decide.

You should, too. Otherwise, we really won’t have a country, and we really will be doomed.",1,1761107925.0,USNewsHub,0,1.0,False

I was fourteen when my parents divorced. Their arguments had been constant, walls shaking, doors slamming, glass shattering. I learned to hide in the corners of my room, headphones blaring, trying not to notice the hollowness growing in my chest.

My mother moved out, my father retreated into work, and I was left in a fractured house that smelled of bleach and old coffee, echoing with absence. It wasn’t just the loneliness; it was the feeling that life was broken and that I was powerless to fix it.

That’s when I discovered lucid dreaming. The first time I realized I was aware inside a dream, I felt a surge of control I had never known. I could bend the world to my will. Anything I imagined, it would come true.

For the first time, I could create happiness, create worlds where pain didn’t exist, where I wasn’t an observer to suffering.

I was God.

At first, I started small.

I walked through forests that glowed in shades I had no names for. I could summon rainbows that arched across violet skies. I made friends in these worlds, creatures that spoke with humor and kindness, always ready to listen, always ready to understand. I relived moments of joy I hadn’t had, moments of safety and warmth that never existed in real life.

I even conjured, what I deemed perfect, my own home. The divorce never happened. The resentment my parents had in reality was hidden by the loving joy that I created.

We could be a family.

But it wasn’t enough. My control became more deliberate, more urgent.

I wasn't satisfied. I needed more.

I experimented.

I created cities that pulsed with light and sound, alive like music made manifest. I created beings who adapted to me, who grew and learned from me. I rewrote history, making impossible things happen, mountains sprouting overnight, rivers folding in impossible loops, stars that danced to the rhythm of my thoughts.

I was addicted.

As I built society further and further, I couldn't differentiate if it I was in reality or asleep. It didn't matter. I didn't want to wake up.

The more I created, the more my waking life seemed hollow, gray, insignificant.

What felt like days, even weeks, were merely only hours of sleep. I'd even mastered to bend my created beings with their own self thought. Their free will in my dreams. Oh how they dreamt and I, their God, could see their own dreams. Their own thoughts and ambitions.

Then I made a decision I will never forget.

I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped interfering, if I left my creations to their own devices. If I, their creator, were to disappear.

Within the dream, I closed my eyes and fell into a dream within a dream, drifting deeper than I ever had.

I left my creation running, untended, leaving it to course as it would without me.

At first, it seemed fine.

The sky remained impossibly vibrant. Oceans of liquid crystal rippled beneath my feet. Cities thrived, creatures and people roamed, oblivious to my absence. But subtle changes began. A tower leaned slightly, though I hadn’t touched it. A river hesitated mid-flow, as if uncertain where it wanted to go. The citizens paused, glancing around with expressions I had never taught them, curiosity, doubt, even impatience.

Then came the worse. A nightmare scenario.

The sky was red. And fire began.

I watched in shock as my world, that I have spent a millennia creating in my head burn. The people, the wildlife, the world itself ate itself.

Greed, hunger for power, the vial vines of corruption overtook my world, and I sat and watched.

What seem to be red liquid fell from the skies, putting and end to the flames.

When it was it over, I returned to my world, imagining that my presence would restore order. But the moment I stepped back, I realized it was already gone.

The survivors of my world looked at me with such anger. I could see how vile in their heart had become. Their being was split from me. From my control.

My world was no longer mine.

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn’t interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

God may wake, but the universe He made… does not need him anymore.

Author’s Note:
Hey everyone, thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. I’m still a relatively new writer, and every bit of feedback means the world to me. This concept is one I’d honestly love to expand into a full short story series someday, since it’s something that really sticks with me.

Funny thing, I originally tried posting this on r/nosleep and got hit with a 60-day ban (guess that’s on me 😅). It’s definitely a tough place to post on, but hey… we live, we learn, we love. God bless and all.

Big shoutout to Creepcast, by the way, the stories they read stories and this community really inspired me to finally start sharing my own writing.

If you read this far, thank you again. I’d love to hear your thoughts or theories about the story, they genuinely keep me motivated to keep creating 🙏🏼

What should i do?,"i can't hold it in anymore. phew. i needed an outlet to let this out, and i couldn't think of something worse than telling a friend who might judge me. What can 18F do with her sudden feelings for 24M supervisor at work?

I hustle part-time as a product promoter at a grocery store near my college, and recently worked with a 24M who's also a student at a near private university. He was very kind to me, despite being a strict person overall. he was very front and quite passive-agressive whenever any of my co-workers make mistakes, but very adamant with me. perhaps its because we don't speak the same language (he's chinese, and i'm malay, therefore different religions and mother tongues) so it was hard for him to be direct with me. or perhaps because i was the youngest staff there? i really wonder. he joked around a lot with me, mind you he doesn't mind me playfully hitting him while i was laughing off his joke. he asked me if i was okay because i had eyebags (i slept late watching k-dramas the night before..). he subtly cared, carrying heavy boxes for me, always asking if there's any trouble i'm facing while promoting. he playfully scolded me for 'flirting' with customers (an older uncle playfully asked me to go home with him. weird, i know.). and in many, i think i was the only person he could show that he was stressed with. when we were closing off on the final day, he was throwing the coffee packs around, sighing in distress. meanwhile, other staff were having fun and taking pictures as momentos. so i talked to him, gently coaxed and said to not be so stressed and i could help him out if he's tired. he nods and apologized, saying sorry for throwing a fit and he can do it on his own. 

mind you, the promotion event was only for 4 days, and it has passed by. yet my heart still clenches at the thought of him, the thought of never seeing him again, and no contact outside of work whatsoever. help me. i dont know what to do with my feelings. it just gets heavier every day, even though i know its impossible for us to be together. i know that perhaps i'm tripping— probably harboring these desires and feelings as i never had an older man's attention that was this comfortable. yet again, part of me thinks he's just as into me. what should i do, people?",2,1761107845.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1ocyupa,https://i.redd.it/08vjnow3dlwf1.png,2k+ users in 4 days - but not a single “buy me a coffee”. My Free Pomidor App Story...,"\[Find App Store Below\]

Hey everyone,

I recently launched my iOS app (some of you will remember), and to my surprise, it already has over 2,000 users in just 4-5 days. The retention is super high - people are actually using it daily, which makes me really happy as an indie dev.

But here’s the thing that kind of hit me:  
I added a simple ""*Buy me a coffee""* button (just $1), and so far… just a single person has invested in.

It’s not about the money itself - more like realizing how hard it is to get even a tiny voluntary support, even when users seem to genuinely enjoy the app.

So I’m curious - for those of you who've tried donation buttons, or as users yourselves  
👉 Do you think people just don't feel motivated to support apps this way?  
👉 Or maybe I should rethink the placement, message, or value behind that button?

Would love to hear your honest thoughts - it’s part of the learning journey as a solo developer.

And don't forget, I'm always happy to improve and keep it for free with your feedback. So the new update is coming soon!

People keep asking how they can help and when I give an answer it never fails that they do something completely different. For example I say it might be nice to have door dash gift cards for days I work long hours and can’t get dinner done in time because I couldn’t prep. Then follow that with, we do not eat much so meal trains lead to an abundance of food and food waste. What happens, I have a table full of Tupperware and wasted food and then the worry of how to get the dishes back to the correct people. 
I say, I need help pulling out the air conditioners from the windows for winter, this will be followed up with, oh we will get people out to help with yard work because they think this is a more important thing to be done. Air conditioners are still in the windows and it makes the house drafty and hard to heat which is bad for my husband. 
I guess what I am saying, I am thankful that people want to help, but sometimes it actually means more work or work that I am capable of doing done while other things I am not capable of doing go undone. 
So I was told to make a list, read from the list and specifically say, I do not need anything, but these things. 
I do not want to isolate the community I have, but also, I am exhausted and don’t need help, that isn’t helpful. Having people outside working makes my husband agitated and can lead hallucinations that then cause him to accuse me of cheating. It’s a whole thing.
Honestly, because I am younger and not in a high tax bracket, I have to work full time, I have no shame in asking for help, but people really don’t get the delicate balance of asking for help and maintaining peace of mind for my husband. I can’t have a revolving door and I do need help. Both things are true. 
I don’t want to be a chooser beggar, but also, when I offer to help someone I listen to what they are saying without a perceived expectation of what they need. Then evaluate if I can do what they need. I have learned that most people have preemptively decided what they are willing to do and align what I say to fit that notion. So…
Have any of you made such a list? How do you handle unhelpful help? What is on your list? 
I currently have:
-Walk dogs a couple times a month or week
-Scheduled meal drop off ( one at a time) or door dash cards
-Pick up a grocery order that I pay for
-Dang air conditioners that my shoulder will not let me move
-Some junk removal bc my husband is a hoarder now
-And for a chosen few, a coffee visit
-even smaller chosen few, take hubby out for a couple hours while he is still able

It took quite a while for me to decide to enter in a relationship with her due to the constant red flags she exhibited. These include:

1)Making me feel guilty constantly, 2)extreme jealousness, 3)biting a friend when she got jealous, 4)biting me once to the point of bleeding and leaving me a scar on the arm (she was too drunk to remember) 5) suicidal threats, 6) deciding not to leave my taxi when she got angry, 7) getting too drunk sometimes, 8) coming to my doorstep when I told her not to do it when uninvited 8) creating public scenes in the street and restaurants. Dont get me wrong , she also made very nice gestures during that time such as buying some clothes, cooking, giving me presents or even giving me massage sometimes; however, I was never fully happy with it since I felt she used that as a control mechanism to make me meet her more frequently. Later on, in fact she she has used her presents (which I opposed to receive) against me saying in i dont do the same for her. In any case, during this time I tried to get ride of her due to her behaviour but I guess I am weak and failed all my attempts because I  I also liked her attention, thus whenever she forced a meet up coming to my home uninvited.. I ended up opening the door. I suggested her  to go to a psychologist but.. she refuses saying she has no money ( they can give her a discount according to her  her earnings)

Anyway, after I decided to give her a chance, she became more controlling. Through ultimatums she now has made me  accept: 1) cannot meet female friends alone even for a coffee, 2) I must spend with her 4x times per week,  3) I must move in with her, 4) I  cannot go to the dancing venue alone anymore because she believes I am flirtatious (however she goes alone).  Now  also she tells me I do not accomplish any of the promises I made her (such as buying her a ring (I told her I could do silver but she says silver is fake, she wants 18k gold). That is another story I need to throw up at this point. In her birthday I bought her flowers, took her to a Japanese restaurant and bought her a nice cheese cake. She started crying  at the restaurant saying it was the worst birthday of her life for not getting the ring she wanted, the only thing that according to her she has only demanded. She also said the previous year that is was the worst birthday of her life when I bought her a helmet (her was absolutely unsafe).

In any case, recently, she is extremely irritated, every day there is some sort of drama, she says I am not man enough, that I dont provide her with anything, that I dont follow up with my promises, that she is not my top priority while I am hers, that I dont care about her safety, that I dont offer her a future and that she is getting too old to become attractive for other guys if our thing fails. She also compares me to other boyfriends of her friends and says she is jealous because the way they are treated.  She also says there are other men with money interested in her and that she rejects them because of me. On the top of it, the other day she got a jealous attack when we were out, and she decided to go drinking alone (to which I opposed since may not be safe). Anyway, she kicked me out and I went home alone. During that time, she drunk till she couldnt walk straight, posted a story trying to look good in IG (I guess due to her wanting attention) and then she blamed me for letting her go drinking alone! I drive most conversations with her. She tends to talk  mostly  about her feelings,,,

With her I have been in an emotional roller coaster most of the time and now that she says very frequently we should break up; however, i dont let her go somehow. I guess I have in my mind the good side of her (caring) and I dont really wanna lose that side. May be some biological bullshit instinct of fear of losing something is kicking in... what shall I do? how??",1,1761107202.0,relationship_advice,13,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I work at a pharmacy retailer and I have an NT supervisor who is genuinely well meaning. She gets food and buys coffee for everyone regularly, also pretty helpful when push comes to shove. Tonight, I was putting away some back stock, and I find this hairspray bottle that’s lid is basically snapped in two. I tell her if she could put it in damages and she agrees.

A moment later, she comes up to me and picks up the can. 

Supervisor: “So how’d you break it.” 
Me: “I didn’t.”
Supervisor: “suree.” 

I get defensive and repeat that it was on the back stock cart like that. 

Suoervisor: “oh I’m being sarcastic”
Me: “bro I’m autistic I cannot understand that kind of joke If you say it completely straight”
Supervisor: “That’s why I do it, you act exactly like my [also autistic] brother, it’s funny!”

I kinda just freeze up because like, no, it’s not all that funny to me? That feels like I’m the subject of ridicule literally for not being able to detect sarcasm. she apparently clocks that I’m not really having it.

Supervisor: “I was just joking, you seem upset.”
Me: “Uh yeah. Please don’t make those kind of jokes with me.”
Supervisor: “Okay!”

So, I think that’s that, cool that she just agreed to stop. I go on my fifteen right after like we’d planned. Well she comes back to the break room and decides to tell me something I really didn’t need to hear.

Apparently there was a customer that overheard our exchange. And when I went to break this customer rolled their eyes and said to my supervisor, “sarcasm is a love language.” My supervisor then told this customer that I had autism and the customer proceeded to apologize.

The supervisor then comes back to the break room and tells me about this exchange I didn’t know about and tells me that the customer apologized. 

The whole “her telling a customer I have autism” thing is kind of irking me. I’m not actually diagnosed with anything, but she didn’t have to say I was autistic. She could’ve been like “I’m respecting his boundaries because that’s a good thing to do.” Because that’s equally true. 

And the customer can go fuck themselves otherwise. I truly don’t know why she went and told me about that on my break, because I really could’ve gone my whole life without knowing that and been fine y’know.",6,1761107043.0,evilautism,2,0.88,False

I’m planning to bake a tiramisu cake (not the traditional ladyfinger version) for my bf's birthday. He's Italian, so I really want to make it as authentic as possible.

I used to bake a lot, but haven’t had much time lately since I’m studying. I recently got a mixer (finally) after doing everything by hand before, but I haven’t had the chance to use it yet, so this will be my first go with it.

Here are the things I’d love some advice on:

* Do I need to include rum or whiskey? My bf is allergic to alcohol, and it’s been hard to find a good recipe without it.
* What kind of cake would work best ( eg vanilla, sponge, or something else)
* What kind of coffee should I use for the espresso soak? I only have Nescafé Gold, but I know espresso usually needs ground coffee. Any brand or blend recommendations? (I’ll list what’s available at my local grocer.)
* Which brand would you recommend? I’ll include a few links to the ones I can get locally.
* I want to write “Happy Birthday” on top using a stencil and cocoa powder. Would that work, or is there a better/easier method?
* Any advice for making a tiramisu cake?
