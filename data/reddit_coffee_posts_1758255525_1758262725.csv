One thing I've noticed is that ""American"" breakfast as thought about by non-americans is not what most of us eat on a daily basis. We might eat some eggs and bacon, or a pastry and coffee occasionally through the week. I feel media makes you think we have a giant spread full of sugar on a daily basis. Kids do eat a lot of sugar laced cereal, but the breakfast as seen in the media is far from that for adults on a regular basis. We get that at most on a weekend that we want to go to a dinner and have pancakes, or a waffle with bacon or sausage. My question is how often are you getting a full English breakfast.  Not just some beans on toast or a croissant and coffee. I also have no idea how often you are eating beans on toast.",1,1758262494.0,AskBrits,0,1.0,False

My experience has been so bad and they do scam of even the lowest amount imaginable. I was scammed for ‚Çπ180. And the taste is okay-ish at best.

I placed a pre paid order during some discount where I got 40g chocolate for ‚Çπ60 each and looking such variety of flavours, the healthy claims and those pretty images on the website. The chatora that I am, I ordered some 11 chocolates and brownies all of different flavours.

After a week or more of no updates and me constantly having to message (with occasional replies) I was sure IF I receive the order it would not turn out good. The customer service is shitty af! Kinda non existent.

Even after they marked the order as ready to ship they would constantly no hand over the package to the BlueDart person for shipping and that happened for like a week maybe.

I unexpectedly received my order after a lot many days and so I made an unboxing video. And unsurprisingly 2 brownies and 1 chocolate were missing. I contacted them sending videos and everything through whatsapp, instagram and the company head through instagram. First they refused to believe then after messaging them everyday they acknowledged and said they'll refund the amount in 24hrs, which they said 2 months ago and are still saying the same fucking thing. Whatever matrix they are in that hasn't completed 24hrs yet, is beyond my reality.

Coming to the taste, some of the chocolates taste like sand like the biscoff one is really bad.
Rest of them taste okay, kinda weird though. You feel like you're eating a chocolate but it doesn't taste as much like it. And the flavours are very subtly pressent in the hazelnut, blueberry and coffee one. Rest of them kinda taste same.",18,1758261937.0,SnacksIndia,4,1.0,False

Built an AI system to analyze reviews specifically for durability indicators.

**The Challenge**: Most reviews focus on first impressions or short-term use. Needed to identify patterns in reviews that predict long-term reliability.

**Data Sources**:

* Amazon reviews spanning 2+ years
* Reddit buy-it-for-life recommendations
* Repair forum discussions
* Warranty claim patterns

**What the AI looks for**:

**Positive durability indicators**:

* Reviews from users who mention ownership duration (1+ years)
* Specific mentions of heavy use or abuse survival
* Comparisons to previous products that failed
* Details about maintenance and care

**Red flags for poor durability**:

* Multiple reports of failure around same timeframe
* Mentions of ""cheaply made"" or ""flimsy"" construction
* Pattern of positive initial reviews followed by negative long-term ones
* Frequent warranty replacement discussions

**Surprising findings**:

**Price vs durability correlation is weak**

* Many expensive products have poor long-term track records
* Sweet spot is often 60-70% of premium price
* Some budget options outperform luxury alternatives

**Category-specific patterns**:

* Electronics: Failure rates spike at 18 months (planned obsolescence?)
* Appliances: Motor quality is best predictor of longevity
* Tools: Professional-grade components at consumer prices perform best

**Implementation**: Integrated this into Yaw AI chrome extension. When you're shopping, it automatically shows:

* Durability score based on long-term review analysis
* Common failure points mentioned by users
* Alternative products with better longevity records

**Current limitations**:

* Newer products don't have enough long-term data
* AI sometimes misinterprets sarcasm in reviews
* Struggles with products that have been redesigned recently

**Example success**: Helped me choose a coffee grinder. Popular $150 model had great initial reviews but pattern of motor failure at 14 months. AI suggested $89 alternative with 4+ year track record. Still working perfectly 8 months later.

Bahrain Company Formation and Banking Requirements in 2025,"Is It Mandatory to Have a Dedicated Business Bank Account? Bahrain Company Formation and Banking Requirements in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business professionals in a modern meeting, Bahrain company formation., Bahrain posted a GDP growth of 2.9% in 2024 and projections for 2025 suggest steady advances, powered by fintech, logistics, and professional services. The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) reports over $2.8 billion in direct investment attracted in 2024, with a surge in company registrations from foreign entrepreneurs‚Äîa testament to Bahrain‚Äôs open, business-friendly reputation. Gulf News highlights Bahrain‚Äôs rising status as the Gulf‚Äôs start-up magnet, fueled by international banking presence in the Diplomatic Area and competitive cost structures.\
However, the regulatory landscape keeps evolving. In January 2025, the Central Bank of Bahrain quietly rolled out tighter Know-Your-Customer (KYC) standards for all commercial entities. If you plan to establish a business anywhere from the hive of Seef District to the futuristic Bahrain Bay, understanding local banking requirements isn‚Äôt just good practice‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity.\
Bahrain stands apart from its GCC neighbors. Unlike some Saudi company formation models that still require complicated sponsorship frameworks, Bahrain now permits 99% foreign ownership for many business activities (source), offering a serious advantage over the UAE (where mainland banking remains tricky). This competitive edge draws both regional and international founders.\
\
Expert Answer: Is a Dedicated Business Bank Account Mandatory for Bahrain Companies?\
The Regulatory Bottom Line\
Yes‚Äîif you‚Äôre forming a registered business in Bahrain, a dedicated business bank account is not only highly recommended but, in nearly all cases, strictly required.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) mandates that all entities with a Commercial Registration (CR), whether a W.L.L., S.P.C., or B.S.C., must operate a separate business banking relationship. Official guidance: Bahrain.com\
\
Personal bank accounts cannot be used for commercial transactions, tax filings, or compliance submissions. Attempting to ‚Äúskip‚Äù this requirement is a red flag for authorities and exposes you to heavy penalties (I saw one expat‚Äôs import license suspended for mixing personal and company funds‚Äîa classic rookie mistake).\
Why the Strictness? Practical and Legal Rationale\
\
Regulatory compliance: Anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorism rules (especially post-2024 updates) require all business transactions to be traceable and separated from personal finances.\
Financial clarity: For Sijilat filing, Tamkeen funding, and annual LMRA wage audits, clean, categorized business transactions are mandatory.\
Legal risk: Using personal accounts for business is a violation of Bahrain‚Äôs Commercial Companies Law (Law No. 21 of 2001). Violations can lead to commercial registration suspension or worse.\
\
From personal experience, the bank account issue isn‚Äôt just about ticking a box. When I set up in the Diplomatic Area, my company‚Äôs first tender was delayed two weeks because our payment details didn‚Äôt align with the registered business name‚Äîcosting us both time and credibility.\

\
Bahrain Business Types & Ownership Structures: How Account Requirements Vary\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, team in boardroom. & With Limited Liability (W.L.L.)\
\
Must open an account in the company‚Äôs legal name.\
Bank will require CR, MOICT license, and other KYC documents.\
All director(s) or authorized signatories must be present at account opening.\
\
Foreign-Owned Entities & Branches\
Bahrain is uniquely open: up to 99% foreign ownership is allowed for many sectors (detailed activities list here). But:\
* Additional documentation may include parent company resolutions and overseas proof of address.\
* Remote account opening‚Äîpossible in free zones, rare for mainland.\
Free Zone Companies\
Free zones in Bahrain (like Bahrain Logistics Zone) offer speedier setup and less paperwork, but still require a dedicated company account.\
\
Tangent: I once spent a week shuttling between AMAS Tower and the MOICT in Sanabis, learning the hard way that banking documentation varies by zone. The EDB office in Bahrain Bay published a handy checklist‚Äîtotally worth referencing before you begin.\
\
Partnerships, Branches, and Others\
\
Account must be in the partnership or branch‚Äôs official name, with partnership agreement and CR.\
Local sponsorship? Not usually required, but if you go that route, some banks require additional signatory approval (details).\

Company stamp (yes, many banks still ask for this, especially at branches in Seef Mall)\
\
Insider shortcut: Banks often want copies stamped by the MOICT. Go to the Diplomatic Area branch‚Äîcounter staff there process document certification fastest, in my experience.\
3. Choose The Right Bank & Branch\
\
International banks (HSBC, Citibank, Ahli United) offer English-speaking service but sometimes stricter KYC.\
Local banks (Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait, Khaleeji) are more flexible and process paperwork faster‚Äîespecially in Seef District and the Diplomatic Area.\
\
Avoid:\
* Applying during Ramadan business hours unless you‚Äôre comfortable with slower pace and unexpected closures for prayer.\
* Fridays (banks close early), and first day of the month (finance teams are slammed).\
4. Submit Application and Attend In-Person Verification\
\
At least one director or authorized signatory must attend in person. (Remote is rare; don‚Äôt believe anyone who says otherwise.)\
Smile and accept the customary Arabic coffee‚Äîrelationship-building is still important, even at the big banks!\
\
5. Wait for Account Activation\
\
Standard timeline: 7-14 working days (as of May 2025).\
Insider tip: Call after 3 business days and politely reference your MOICT case number‚Äîspeeds up processing.\
\
6. Collect Your Account Details and Cheque Book\
\
Verify account name matches CR‚Äîany mismatch will ruin your VAT registration!\

Cost Considerations: What Will You Spend on a Bahrain Business Bank Account?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, reviewing budget and calculator.. International banks typically charge more: BHD 150-250.\
Monthly account maintenance: BHD 5-10 for standard business accounts; more for multi-currency or premium packages.\
\
Minimum deposit requirements: Vary BHD 500‚Äì2000 depending on bank.\
Extras: Cheque books (BHD 10-20), online banking access (sometimes free, sometimes BHD 20/year).\
\
Budget range for first-year banking: BHD 170-400 total, including all fees and minimum balances.\
\
For a breakdown of company formation and ongoing cost structures, visit Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
\
A frequent mistake: New business owners failing to budget for annual maintenance fees or missing minimal balance requirements, resulting in frozen accounts. My tip? Always keep a BHD 100 ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù above the minimum to avoid surprise penalties, especially if you travel frequently or leave Bahrain in the summer.\
\
Compliance, Tax Filings, and Post-Formation Bookkeeping\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, audit process. require a clean, transparent audit trail.\
* Annual audited financials now mandatory for most SMEs over BHD 100,000 turnover.\
* Non-compliance triggers penalties‚Äîup to BHD 5000 for failing to provide adequate banking records to authorities.\
For smooth accounting, I always recommend using an experienced local accountant (find help here) and keeping digital copies of every payment slip and bank statement. Even small cash transactions should be channeled through the company account for full transparency.\
Surprisingly, one year I received a call from a VAT auditor about an oddly small BHD 3 ATM withdrawal. It turned out an employee used the business debit card for parking at Moda Mall‚Äîharmless, but underscored just how granular compliance reviews can be in 2025.\
\
Insider Tips: Time, Stress, and Queue Savers\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, expert consultation.‚Äîavoid Monday crowds and Friday early closings.\
* Location hack: Diplomatic Area‚Äôs ‚ÄúBank Street‚Äù (near Central Bank of Bahrain) features nearly every major bank‚Äîone trip, multiple options.\
* Document prep: Pre-stamp every document at MOICT (Sanabis branch processes certifications in under 20 minutes).\
* Majlis-style networking: If you‚Äôre invited for coffee with a branch manager, accept‚Äîpersonal rapport can turn a ‚Äúpending‚Äù application into ‚Äúapproved.‚Äù\
* Ramadan rules: During Ramadan, plan visits within the first two hours of opening‚Äîafter that, service slows and queues lengthen.\
* Digital workflow: Use Sijilat‚Äôs online portal for CR printouts, and always keep scanned PDF copies on your phone or a secure cloud folder.\
Biggest challenge I ever faced? I once had a CR approval, lease, and accountant all ready‚Äîbut bank forms kept bouncing because my company stamp was ‚Äútoo faint.‚Äù Solution: I popped into Seef Mall‚Äôs stationery shop and had a new stamp made on the spot. Cost? BHD 4. Time saved? Days of waiting and frustration.\
\
Bahrain Business Customs & Regulatory Nuances\
Business in Bahrain is a human affair. Expect to conduct meetings in the majlis‚Äîlounges with plush seating and the aroma of cardamom coffee in the air. Relationships come first; paperwork, second. During Ramadan, official work hours shorten and everything from bank queues to government counters slow down. Always greet officials with respect‚Äîusing the correct titles can smooth even the most tangled bureaucratic hiccups.\
Coffee, always served before negotiations, plays a real role. (Never refuse the first cup; it‚Äôs a sign of goodwill.)\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Banking: What Sets Bahrain Apart\
While the UAE remains slightly ahead in banking speed, Bahrain‚Äôs regulatory environment is notably more flexible for foreign founders, particularly for those without local sponsors (full list of 100% foreign-owned eligible activities). Saudi, by contrast, typically requires KYC from both the founder and the sponsor‚Äîa layer of complexity that slows down the process.\
Bahrain‚Äôs smaller size and relationship-based banking culture mean you can solve many issues face-to-face, without endless digital queuing‚Äîyes, there‚Äôs still a place for handshakes here.\
\
Recent 2025 Regulatory Updates: What You Must Know\
On 4 January 2025, the Central Bank of Bahrain implemented enhanced due diligence for all companies with cross-border transactions over BHD 10,000/month.\
* Now, banks must obtain updated beneficial owner disclosures, proof of source of funds, and annual CR renewals before reissuing online banking tokens.\
* This new rule applies to all company bank accounts‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre registered in Bahrain Bay or Marassi Business Park.\
Fail to comply and your account could be frozen without warning. Stay ahead by working with an accountant who tracks these rule changes in real time (reliable providers here).\
\
Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\
\
Mixing personal and business finances: Never, ever co-mingle funds. Even ‚Äútemporary‚Äù blurring can get your CR flagged.\
Ignoring document requirements: MOICT-certified copies are a must; photos or scans often rejected.\
Missing renewal deadlines: Both bank accounts and CRs must be renewed annually, no exceptions.\
Underestimating bank scrutiny: AML flags have gone up dramatically since 2024. Prepare for more questions, especially as a foreign founder.\
\
If you forget to prepare sufficient ID copies or skip the company stamp for any form, expect at least a week‚Äôs delay (I learned this the hard way, twice).\
\
Recommended Resources & Service Providers\
\
For smooth, timely bank account opening, KeylinkBH consistently delivers‚Äîstaff speak both English and Arabic, and their document checklists save hours.\
For compliance, Bahrain.com and the MOICT portal remain the best official resources.\

\
FAQ: Bahrain Business Banking & Company Formation\
Do I really need a business bank account if I‚Äôm running a very small or freelance business?\
Yes. Even a one-person S.P.C. or tiny W.L.L. must maintain a separate, company-named bank account for compliance, payments, and filings. Mixing personal and business funds is strictly not allowed by Bahrain MOICT and Central Bank rules.\
Can I open a business account before my CR is approved?\
No. The CR (Commercial Registration) is the primary document banks require to begin KYC and open an account. Ensure your CR is finalized before visiting the bank. Fastest route: use KeylinkBH‚Äôs formation process for end-to-end support.\
Which Bahrain banks are best for fast account opening?\
Local banks like Khaleeji, BBK, and Bahrain Islamic Bank often process new accounts fastest, especially for W.L.L. and S.P.C. structures. International banks like HSBC or Citibank are reliable but may take longer due to stricter checks.\
How much money do I need to deposit to open a business bank account?\
Most Bahraini banks require BHD 500‚Äì2000 as a minimum opening deposit. Check their latest fee tables, and always keep a buffer above the minimum to avoid penalties or account freezing. See up-to-date cost breakdowns here.\
What if my company fails a KYC check or my account is delayed?\
First, ensure all submitted documents are MOICT-certified copies. Second, follow up in person at the branch and, if possible, ask for the relationship manager directly‚Äîpersonal connections count in Bahrain. Third, consult an experienced business formation consultant for troubleshooting and escalation.\

Navigating Bahrain‚Äôs business banking landscape is both art and science. With the right documents, careful timing, and a dash of local savvy, you‚Äôll find the process smoother than you imagined. And if in doubt?

I am a student, on a study leave, and so I get paid half my salary, which is like 30k.

2 month back, he asked for money to top up some payments, and I gave him all my savings. He promised he would pay back, which he hasn't till now.

I did most of the shopping this month, but we are running out. We manage the basics, I buy bread, milk and mboga, so we can get some food.

I have to get to my internship everyday, and that is like 300 shillings. Jana, I left without taking breakfast and I was so hungry. I was sure I would be back over lunch, and maybe my boyfriend would have cooked us something. We have all the cereals in the house, part of the shopping I did. To my shock, he cooked his food, and ate it all, leaving all the dirty dishes. The bed wasn't even spread, the house was untidy, and well, he was naked, clearly from sleeping.

So I come home, made my coffee, ate it with some bananas, and went to bed to rest. I was exhausted, and moody.  And he got mad, cuz I couldn't talk to him, which never bothered me. My social battery was over then.

Today morning, he says he wants to show up at work, and asks for some fare. Which I have no problem giving. So I send him some 500 shillings, and call in sick.

Thing is, i am frustrated. I am a first born, and so i get all kind of calls from my siblings and family asking for money, which i dont have enough. I support my boyfriend, yet he is the one working, and isn't doing anything to help the situation. He can't even clean, at all. He doesn't even help cook. I feed him, I clean him, yet still I have to read and work out my life.

At my work there is a public clinic on the lower ground floor and from there up a small flight of stairs are seminar rooms that you walk past to get to the cafeteria. Every fortnight we have a staff meeting and they put on coffee, tea and light refreshments outside the seminar rooms for the staff to have in the meeting. It's literally the only perk we get. 

People other then staff were taking them meaning there was none for the staff so they put a sign saying staff only. That didn't work so now I have stand there and tell people. Most people when you point it out understand and just continue on to the cafeteria to get a drink. I usually tell them if they wait until all the staff has gone into the meeting they can come and help themselves to whatever is left 

Except boomers. I've had them push past me, call security, threaten my job. I've heard every argument: my taxes pay for this; it's in the open you can't stop me; it's illegal to not give coffee to those waiting. It's always boomers.

* **Light Roast (Medium-Light for us)** ‚Üí highlights bright citrus, floral notes, and a bit of tea-like sweetness. Many of our Bukidnon lots shine here.
* **Medium Roast** ‚Üí balances sweetness and body, with more chocolate and nutty tones. This is the ‚Äúcomfort cup‚Äù that many Filipino coffee drinkers enjoy.
* **Dark Roast** ‚Üí smooth and bold, with smoky, bittersweet notes. Works well for traditional brewing like *barako* style or espresso lovers who want punch.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a mismatch so stark, it‚Äôs like betting on gravity to pull a feather downward. On September 20, 2025, the No. 3 Louisville Cardinals (7-1) will host the Bowling Green Falcons in a game that‚Äôs already decided on the betting board. Let‚Äôs break down why this is a surefire bet for Louisville‚Äîand why Bowling Green might want to bring a helmet *and* a therapist.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Louisville‚Äôs Dominance, Bowling Green‚Äôs Desperation

The numbers scream ‚Äúpick ‚Äôem if you‚Äôre blind.‚Äù Louisville is a **-26.5-point favorite** across most books, with moneyline odds of **+1.02 decimal** (implied probability: \~98%). For context, that‚Äôs like betting on the sun to rise tomorrow. Bowling Green‚Äôs +15-17 odds? That‚Äôs the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúIf you bet on the Falcons, we‚Äôll buy you a lifetime supply of ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô coffee mugs.‚Äù

The total points line sits at **51.5**, with slightly better value on the over. Why? Louisville‚Äôs offense is a well-oiled combine harvester, averaging 48 points in recent wins over teams that probably still use a chalkboard for play calls. If they hit their stride, this game could end 50-10, with Bowling Green‚Äôs score inflated only by a Hail Mary that grazes the crossbar.

1nkv6d0,https://i.redd.it/a5td1fof52qf1.jpeg,Fun fact Why Students in Czech Republic Get Beer Cheaper Than Water,"üëáüëáü§£
When you think about school, you imagine books, exams, and maybe a little coffee to stay awake. But in the Czech Republic, students can actually get a beer in the university canteen for less than the price of bottled water. Yes, beer is literally cheaper than water.

This is not some hidden party trick, it‚Äôs culture. The Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per person in the world. Beer is not seen as a luxury, it‚Äôs just part of daily life. For students, that means you can grab a pint in between classes without breaking your budget. Imagine finishing a lecture and heading for ‚Äúhydration‚Äù with a cold glass of lager.

What‚Äôs even funnier is that the country still manages to produce brilliant graduates. Clearly, cheap beer doesn‚Äôt kill brain cells as fast as people think. Some say it even keeps students calm during stressful exam seasons.

So while in most countries you pay high prices just to get clean water on campus, in Prague you can quench your thirst with golden liquid bread for pocket change. Education might be expensive everywhere, but at least in Czech universities, the drinks are student friendly.

My husband didn‚Äôt want to come. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hang back, game a little, order pizza,‚Äù he said. He‚Äôs 41. I thought, ‚ÄúFine, he‚Äôs an adult, he‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

He was not fine.

Day 2, he decided he was going to become a ‚Äúgrill master‚Äù even though we don‚Äôt own a grill. He stacked three baking sheets on top of each other, poured lighter fluid over them, and set off the smoke alarm for 40 minutes. The oven still smells like gasoline.

Then, he got really into ‚Äúminimalist living‚Äù after a TikTok binge and threw away half our dishes, claiming ‚Äúwe only need one bowl each.‚Äù Unfortunately, he chose the salad bowl and the dog‚Äôs water dish. Everything else? Gone.

To feed himself, he bulk-ordered 20 frozen burritos and survived on those exclusively. By week two, he was eating them still partially frozen because ‚Äúit‚Äôs basically a cold wrap.‚Äù His justification: ‚Äúsaves electricity.‚Äù

He stopped doing laundry entirely. Just rotated between two pairs of basketball shorts. By the time I got back, they had fused into what I can only describe as ‚Äúdenim-adjacent cardboard.‚Äù The dog started growling every time he sat down.

Last night, I walked in to find him shirtless, playing the recorder he ordered off Amazon because ‚ÄúMozart slapped.‚Äù The living room smelled like burnt plastic and ranch dressing.

This morning, I woke up to him mumbling in his sleep: ‚ÄúI am the burrito.‚Äù The dog has relocated to the bathtub and won‚Äôt come out.

So now I‚Äôm sitting in a caf√©, sipping coffee like it‚Äôs communion wine, with a dog who looks like he‚Äôs seen combat. The barista asked if I wanted almond milk. I just said no. My house is already nut-based chaos.

1nkv2qy,https://i.redd.it/7ws9e1ze42qf1.jpeg,We built an AI-powered system to automate client feedback (our startup story) üöÄ,"What if collecting client feedback wasn‚Äôt a chore, but an automated system that worked for you 24/7?
That‚Äôs the problem my cousin and I have been working on.

Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been building the product in India üñ•Ô∏è while he‚Äôs been in the UAE, sharing it with businesses and validating the idea. Together, we‚Äôve created a SaaS platform that uses automation + AI to help businesses strengthen client relationships and make smarter decisions.

Here‚Äôs the flow we came up with:

When a deal is closed, the system automatically sends a personalized thank-you message to the client.

The client is directed to a branded feedback page (customized to the business‚Äôs style).

All responses go into a live dashboard so business owners can track satisfaction, trends, and growth metrics in real time.

An AI engine highlights patterns + actionable insights.

We even provide mentorship on how to use those insights to improve sales & client loyalty.


The idea is: fully automated, zero manual effort.

Now, to be real‚Äîthis didn‚Äôt come overnight. Before this, we tried reselling products, short films, dropshipping, and digital marketing. Most of those ventures failed üòÖ but they gave us resilience and skills. This time feels different.

A big shoutout to my mentor, Mohammed Nazil K. His GenAI sessions made me realize how powerful AI can be when applied to real problems. Without that push, this might have stayed just another scribble in my notebook.

So yeah, it‚Äôs just two cousins, a lot of coffee, and a vision to make feedback effortless.
If you‚Äôre running a business, I‚Äôd love to know:
üëâ How do you currently handle client feedback?
üëâ Would you consider automating it with a system like this?

I snapped my fingers in front of him, the crack of it sharper than I meant, just to break the silence. He blinked, looked down at his own hands, and whispered, almost too quiet to hear, ‚ÄúI thought I made it obvious.‚Äù

Something twisted in my chest, a sharp, restless ache. The word just slipped out. ‚ÄúCoward.‚Äù
I turned, because standing there felt impossible. But his voice caught me mid-step, pulling me back like a physical force.

‚ÄúThe view was better with you sitting next to me.‚Äù
My breath caught. The air felt thin, like all the oxygen had just been sucked out of the world.

‚ÄúI want you there,‚Äù he went on, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúEverywhere I go. Because when I‚Äôm alone, everything feels‚Ä¶ black and white. Like the world forgot how to be colorful until you showed up.‚Äù He paused, his hands tightening into fists. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even notice before how quiet everything was. How empty. And then you sat beside me, and it was loud. Too loud. Loud in the best way. Like the world finally remembered it was alive.‚Äù

I was stuck. My brain said walk, but my heart had already turned back. Slowly, without thinking, I did too. His coffee-brown eyes lifted from the mountain to me, and for the first time, he wasn‚Äôt hiding.
‚ÄúMy life feels brighter since you,‚Äù he said, the words tumbling out now, desperate. ‚ÄúYou make things sharper, better, real. I see the sky, and I think of you. I hear a song, and I wonder if you‚Äôd like it. I can‚Äôt look at anything without wishing you were there to see it too. You‚Äôve‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve gotten into everything.‚Äù He let out a shaky laugh and shook his head. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm so tired of pretending I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm tired of swallowing it down every time I look at you.‚Äù

His voice cracked, a small, painful sound. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the light I didn‚Äôt know I needed. And I‚Äôm done hiding it. I won‚Äôt hide you.‚Äù

That was it. Something inside me cracked open, a flood I couldn‚Äôt hold back. Every part of me ached‚Äîthe months I‚Äôd spent doubting, the nights I‚Äôd convinced myself I was making this up, the way his silence had felt like it was carving holes in me. I wanted to yell at him for taking so long. I wanted to laugh, to cry, to throw every bottled-up feeling in his face.

But I only moved. One shaky step, then another. He didn‚Äôt. He just watched me, like I might vanish if he blinked.

And when I stopped in front of him, so close I could feel the heat radiating off his skin, I looked at him like he was both everything I wanted and everything I couldn‚Äôt forgive.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking. But my smile was the real truth‚Äîit split wide open, too full of pure joy to hide, too full of longing to stay angry.",1,1758259359.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1nkuzh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1nkuzh9/ive_had_so_much_in_my_past_and_im_afraid_it_is/,I've had so much in my past and I'm afraid it is coming back,"So, I've had many many experiences and honestly, I don't like them. I think I used to in a way enjoy the rush of feeling or experiencing something paranormal. I dated a man that changed everything. Now, I'm a mother of a two year old daughter, and it is bothersome that I'm afraid of things more than she is. 

For starters, I was a young child when my mom and I started seeing a blue orb in our home (whole family agrees that place seemed haunted while we lived there). The orb was following my mom around the house while my dad was out of town. It refused to go into the formal dining room though. Until one day, it started zipping around erratically and went straight into the formal dining room. Instead of it following my mom, she followed it and when she did she heard something outside and she looked and found a man hiding in the bushes who made eye contact with her and ran away. The orb disappeared after that and never came back. We assume it was there just to protect us. 

Then, I remember getting up to go pee one morning. This was in a different house in a completely different state. I sat up in bed and as I turned on my bed light, I saw a man that looked nothing like my brother or father, or anyone I knew go across the door. It was like he wasn't walking but gliding and he this grimaced look on his face and he went into the room next to mine (it was an office). I turned my light back out and figured I'd rather pee in my bed than go out. 

A few years later, we moved again to a house that was very close to a private golf course. I don't think many people golfed there and it was in the desert. I used to like walking there because of the green grass and the little lakes with water fountains in them. I was in high school and went there to clear my head. It was shaped like a horseshoe. The exit was on one of the ends of the horseshoe. One evening, the sun was setting and I started walking home. The golf course didn't have lights, so I was kind of rushed. I got to the top of the horseshoe but realized it was the wrong one and had a long ways to go to correct it. I was walking along the grass, and saw someone on the walking path that lined the perimeter. I saw them looking at me, I waved, they waved. It was a skinny tall white man wearing a light blue shirt and jeans. I was going to approach them (to see if they knew a faster way of getting to the road) when something started feeling off. I stopped and started just looking. They were literally starting to change into a more fluid like being. Their clothing, skin, and body shape just turned into a long skinny glare. Not like bright and shiny, but kind of like when you stare at a light and get a hole in your retina. But it wasn't moving with my eyes, it was staying exactly on same spot of the walking path. It didn't shrink in height, but it just got skinnier and skinnier until it vanished. 

This next experience is one of my least favorite. I was in the same house by the golf course. I stayed up really late as a teenager watching music videos on MTV. My father, woke up about 4 am on a regular basis. One summer, I was up until just after 4 am. I had my bedroom lights on, TV on and was practicing my makeup blending abilities. I realized the time, and thought ""crap! Dad's going to see my lights on and get pissed."" So, I turned off my TV, slunk under the covers and went to turn off my bed light. (It was this bed set with a mirror and storage for the headboard and the metal hinge on the storage drawer would turn the lights overhead on and off just by tapping them) I was afraid of the dark at this point, so I creeped my hand out from under the covers that were already over my head. As I turned off the light I heard a THUMP! I even felt the thump. It sounded and felt like someone punched my pillow right in front of my face. I still had my hand close to the hinge, so I tapped it again quickly. I stayed under the covers until my heart stopped pounding but with the lights on. I finally stopped hiding and sat up. I saw the indentation on my pillow. I did think it could be one of our three cats. I looked all over my room. Didn't see a single cat in my room. I tried again to go to sleep but figured I'd leave my lights on. Because I found no cats but had every reason to believe I was not alone in my room, I didn't rest easily. But as I laid in my bed, I started hearing the doors on my TV cabinet creaking very slowly but the doors weren't moving. I don't know how long I lasted until I just said nope to the whole bedroom and got up and joined my father for breakfast. 

Then there's what killed all things paranormal for me. My ex boyfriend. He was up front with me that the house he lived in (with his mom, brother and sister) was haunted. He also said though that he himself had something following him. He said it went from his father to him. I thought he was just attention seeking. One night we had gone out drinking so I planned on sleeping in his house instead of driving. We went to crash in his living room. He slept on the couch and I was to sleep on the love seat. The lamp beside both the couch and loveseat started making this strange squeaky sound. I determined it sounded as if someone was unscrewing the light bulb. It kept happening until I told him it was freaking me out and I exclaimed ""will you just stop it already!"" At that point, I at least believed his house was creepy. We ended up moving in together after a while and I started having vivid nightmares. I remember one of me being dragged down a hallway and I screamed while scratching my fingers down the wall. Whatever was dragging me could not be seen. 

One day, we worked a morning shift together and decided to take a nap before we went downtown with friends. The bed was up against a wall and my side was the side against the wall. I woke up first and got on my phone for a while. I decided to roll over and when I did, I was confused because this guy was sitting up on the side of the bed looking down smiling with this creepy look on his face. I also felt him however laying beside me. I looked down and saw literally two of him. There was one of him sitting on the edge of the bed looking down watching himself sleeping. The version of him sitting there slowly just faded away. I woke him up freaking the hell out and he said he was having a really good dream. 

Another thing to note about this guy, he was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. When I broke up with him, I moved back in with my parents which was a 9 hour drive away. Like every idiot that doesn't understand narcissistic abuse and love bombing, I agreed to give it another try long distance after he begged me to. One day, he called me really frazzled saying he didn't know what was going on but he woke up in the bathroom and his nails were all raw and he was scratching his hands on the bathroom wall until they bled and he didn't know why or how he got there. He said the cat was afraid of him. I agreed to do a video call to help comfort him. He started acting even more strange then though. He insisted on keeping the lights out. His eyes were dilated. I could see that the cat wanted nothing to do with him. At one point, he fell out of his chair coughing. I disconnected the call on him. He called me on the phone about an hour later and acted like nothing happened. He said he was going drinking with his brother. I was like ""you're just going to act like everything is fine?"" He said he had no idea what I was talking about. I'm sitting here not sure if he was on drugs, playing a gross prank, or actually possessed by something. But, I do know that immediately following that event, I started seeing evil faces. I saw them in the clouds. I saw them in the water trails on the shower door. 

That moment was my breaking point. I dumped him and never looked back. Within days of breaking it off for good, the evil faces vanished. That was about 14 years ago. I should also mention, this man died of Covid in 2020. 

My husband and I bought our house in 2020. Nothing weird had happened until a few months ago. (Other than some motion lights in a closet having a mind of their own). 

The big one for me was a screaming sound. My daughter was about 1.5yo. She was at daycare. I work from home. I was taking my lunch. I had made myself a sandwich and was going to sit in front of the TV and relax. I was already sitting but was moving my feet into a different position, when I heard what sounded exactly like my baby girl wake up crying over the monitor. I literally jumped up and looked to my right, where I heard the sound come from. I honestly thought, ""oh my god, did I dream it that I took her to daycare today?! Has she been in her room this whole time?!"" I was looking for the monitor beside me on the sofa where the sound came from, but it wasn't there. The monitor was sitting on its charger the main bedroom which was the farthest room in the house from where I was sitting. I checked the nursery and it was empty. The dogs were laying in the main bedroom in front of the window completely asleep. 

I called my husband telling him and asking if he maybe accidentally hit the audio output on any of our nanny cameras. He works in a pet store, so maybe he spied on me while a dog started howling? Nope. (My husband is not a prankster nor is he cruel, so I trust him). I never have and probably never will figure out what the sound was. But, it literally was three long cries that had the exact sound of my daughter. 

Then there's the remote. One day, I'm sitting by myself on my lunch break. I'm home alone. The TV remote fell on the floor and I heard it thud. This was no big deal because, I really could have left the remote on the edge of the coffee table without noticing. So, I bend over and pick it up. I'm watching my show again and it falls. This time, I'm 1000% certain I've put it firmly on the table. I moved it to the couch. It happened again. I ended my lunch and went back to work because I was afraid. 

I've been with my family watching TV and the remote has fallen and my husband and I just look at each other now. 

I've also felt like I've seen a figure quickly dart through the hall when I've been alone. My daughter has waved hello/goodbye over my shoulder when no one else was home but us. 

The buttons on the remote also sometimes seem to get pressed. The TV will just switch streaming services on its own. 

Both of my parents are now deceased. I've told him very clearly that they are not allowed to haunt me or my daughter. I've said perfume is fine. Any smell is fine. Little things like feathers in the home, are fine. But, actual haunting style crap isn't welcome. 

I'm not sure what I'm expecting for responses. 

I've had one guy tell me that he is a medium and that he can sense that I could be too if I tried. I will not. Maybe some of this stuff is explainable. Maybe not. But, I'd like to wall myself off from scary crap. 

If I'm slow to respond, it's probably because I'm too scared to look in on this thread often. 

ETA: I've forgotten to add, a few weeks ago, I was doing bedtime with my daughter. We still sit in the rocking chair with her on a boppy pillow until she falls asleep. Her head is always in my left side and my left arm is always under her neck and my left hand will hold her hand and my right hand holds her right hand. Well, this one night, this was the exact thing she and I were doing. But I felt what felt like a finger of hers poking me in the neck. I had my head looking down at her. She has a glow in the dark binkie, so when it falls out of her mouth, I know she's ready to lay in her crib. I not only felt the little finger wiggle on my neck and on my jaw. Sometimes she does flail her hands in weird ways so this sensation didn't even alert me as off until I remembered both her hands were in my hands. As soon as I became aware of it, it stopped.

A week ago my best mate went on a first date with a girl he matched with on Hinge - for them nothing came from the date and they parted ways after it.
He felt, however, myself and her would be a strong match. So he showed her a photo of me, and got permission to share her number to me.

Over the recent weekend, we chit-chatted over SMS for 2 days. On the first day we found a lot of common interests, and she agreed she‚Äôd be interested in a coffee date. I never got to close a date/time as she was busy on the remainder of the weekend, and seemed she still wanted to know more about me. I didn‚Äôt follow up on this coffee date immediately after as I didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòpushy‚Äô.

The next day, after she finished work she reached out to me asking how my day was - we sent voice memos back and forth for a while, and then she asked for a photo. I just sent a ‚Äòbathroom selfie‚Äô as I thought it was the best way for me to get a decent photo of me at that moment. 

She complimented my hair, and I gave a ‚Äòflirty thank you‚Äô back. but have since been ghosted after this. 

I didn‚Äôt want to immediately double text, but i followed up two days later asking how her week was going. Now 3 days later, end of the week, still no response.

I‚Äôm hoping to make one last attempt to get her attention, current ideas are:

1. I am thinking of just sharing better photos of myself from dating profiles that get attention; and just saying along the lines of ‚ÄúI think that photo was crap here are better ones - are you still interested in coffee‚Äù. This is on the pretext she didn‚Äôt me attractive in the photo I sent. 

2. A mate of mine reckons to just call her - not sure if this would be a good idea but I‚Äôm open to it.

I know it wasn‚Äôt much in the grand scheme of thing last and I should move on - but this girl as a person was ticking all the boxes.",1,1758258903.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

So here it is. We've been talking for a while, even had coffe together and shared stories together. I posted a photo from the (friendly?) coffee date‚Äîhe wasn't on the photo but his friends saw his bag‚Äîand teased my nonstop, didn't confirm it though, that it was him. I asked him if I should delete it, but he said that it's okay and the ig story's cute. 

We had coffee because he lost on our bet, I thought he will not take it seriously since we weren't really THAT close and that's what my friends do, they don't take bets seriously‚Äîbut he did. On our way to the coffee shop, he insisted on carrying my laptop bag and he knows the sidewalk rule, like he made me move to the safe side (that was so green flag for me, unexpected). He ordered spanish latte and I ordered matcha latte for our drinks(I did not like it :)). I mean, I love matcha flavored milktea but the coffee's not for me. I made him taste the matcha and I tasted his order. He said it tastes nice (his order), told him I liked it also‚Äîgirl!! We switched orders !! üò≠üò≠üò≠ After asking me if I liked his order, he offered to switch. üò≠

After that date (?), we went back to campus since I had org duties. He walked me to my room even though his car was parked on the other side, stayed with me and my friends for a while, and even brought food for them. Eventually, he went home, but we kept chatting after.

Yesterday, I was rushing a project to pass, and he kept cheering me on since he knew I was juggling orgs and academics. There was also an org event, so I was working while being there. The event ended at 5 PM, but we only got out around 6‚Äîand he was still there. Is it a crime to assume he was waiting for me? Because when I messaged him that I was about to go home, he called out to me and said, ‚Äúbabye!‚Äù‚Äîand he was sooo cute doing that! ü•π

The only thing bothering me is, after we said goodbye yesterday, he hasn‚Äôt messaged me since. :((

Decided on the C60 mainly as a do all grinder. I don‚Äôt do espresso, so fine grinding isn‚Äôt an issue. But I wanted something that works at home as well as on camping trips, or any road trips where I want a nice cup of coffee without much hassle. So for this, durability and warranty are important to me, which is why I went with this over other grinders. My first cup was 18g DD classic at a 1:16 ratio. Setting 35 on the grinder. I ended up with a nice flat bed of what looked like nice even ground coffee, no fines, not big boulders (at least that I know of, I‚Äôll post a pic of my next bed another time) 45 second bloom with 50g water. As far as the grinder, it went through those beans like they weren‚Äôt there, about 10 seconds and the beans were ground. It feels so solid, heavy yes but not unmanageable. The handle gives so much leverage and there is so much space inside the body to hold what I would say about 60gr of beans. Definitely don‚Äôt regret it since it will probably outlive me. Hope you enjoy my small first impression, thank you all.

Also, if anyone has a good iced coffee recipe with dunkin coffee please comment it, I want to make that next for my fianc√© since she‚Äôs the one who for some reason let me buy this lol. Thank you in advance! ",4,1758258816.0,pourover,5,0.64,False

Would love to hear your feedback!,"His face just froze, like he couldn‚Äôt quite process I was there. I snapped my fingers in front of him, the crack of it sharper than I meant, just to break the silence. He blinked, looked down at his own hands, and whispered, almost too quiet to hear, ‚ÄúI thought I made it obvious.‚Äù
Something twisted in my chest, a sharp, restless ache. The word just slipped out. ‚ÄúCoward.‚Äù
I turned, because standing there felt impossible. But his voice caught me mid-step, pulling me back like a physical force.
‚ÄúThe view was better with you sitting next to me.‚Äù
My breath caught. The air felt thin, like all the oxygen had just been sucked out of the world.
‚ÄúI want you there,‚Äù he went on, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúEverywhere I go. Because when I‚Äôm alone, everything feels‚Ä¶ black and white. Like the world forgot how to be colorful until you showed up.‚Äù He paused, his hands tightening into fists. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even notice before how quiet everything was. How empty. And then you sat beside me, and it was loud. Too loud. Loud in the best way. Like the world finally remembered it was alive.‚Äù
I was stuck. My brain said walk, but my heart had already turned back. Slowly, without thinking, I did too. His coffee-brown eyes lifted from the mountain to me, and for the first time, he wasn‚Äôt hiding.
‚ÄúMy life feels brighter since you,‚Äù he said, the words tumbling out now, desperate. ‚ÄúYou make things sharper, better, real. I see the sky, and I think of you. I hear a song, and I wonder if you‚Äôd like it. I can‚Äôt look at anything without wishing you were there to see it too. You‚Äôve‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve gotten into everything.‚Äù He let out a shaky laugh and shook his head. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm so tired of pretending I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm tired of swallowing it down every time I look at you.‚Äù
His voice cracked, a small, painful sound. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the light I didn‚Äôt know I needed. And I‚Äôm done hiding it. I won‚Äôt hide you.‚Äù
That was it. Something inside me cracked open, a flood I couldn‚Äôt hold back. Every part of me ached‚Äîthe months I‚Äôd spent doubting, the nights I‚Äôd convinced myself I was making this up, the way his silence had felt like it was carving holes in me. I wanted to yell at him for taking so long. I wanted to laugh, to cry, to throw every bottled-up feeling in his face.
But I only moved. One shaky step, then another. He didn‚Äôt. He just watched me, like I might vanish if he blinked.
And when I stopped in front of him, so close I could feel the heat radiating off his skin, I looked at him like he was both everything I wanted and everything I couldn‚Äôt forgive.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking. But my smile was the real truth‚Äîit split wide open, too full of pure joy to hide, too full of longing to stay angry.",1,1758258585.0,indianwriters,0,1.0,False

She is very toxic in every way you can think of. She is verbally abusive and have a few habits that she makes her life. Maryjane is 1, cigarettes, and coffee. I know it sounds funny but she will literally go without food to have these things. She doesn‚Äôt help around the house or contribute to the household ever and it‚Äôs been a year.

I told her she has two months to come up with something to move out and I also offered to help support her on the journey. She threatened to kill her self in front of my child who is a teen. My husband is sick of her and scared of her. She is very mean and lazy and abusive. She will hit you cuss at you, say she will kill her self. Then later say sorry and it‚Äôs her menopause smh.

It has continued non-stop since my family doctor‚Äôs appointment.  3 days now as I felt it before doctors visit.

Family doc ran blood panel and ECG. ECG showed the Ventricular Bigeminy.
They direct messaged cardiologist in their system asking that I be seen asap. 

Cardiologist office said first appt Nov. 5 (over a month from now) is their first opening.

Blood test results:
Electrolytes: magnesium and potassium are normal, salt is a a bit below the low limit (despite using salt on my food, and eating things like pickled green olives daily.)

I recently was on oral steroids, and was a heavy coffee drinker. I‚Äôve discontinued both at advice of doctor. 

I‚Äôm on wait list for cardiologist if someone cancels. 

What else can I do to relieve this? Sleeping on my back seems worse. On my tummy feels best for my heart but not best for breathing.

1nku6n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingularityNetwork/comments/1nku6n6/purpose_driving_life/,Purpose driving life,"Defining Consciousness? A logical computation, ""experience and processing,"" directly addresses the two most difficult parts of the problem of consciousness.
Experience: This refers to the subjective, first-person feeling of what it's like to be Me. In philosophy, this is called qualia (e.g., the specific feeling of tasting coffee or the subjective experience of seeing the color red).
Processing: This refers to the objective, information-based, and computational activities of a system, like the firing of neurons in my brain.
This theory bridges these two ideas, which is the central goal of many modern theories of consciousness.
Bridging the Gap: Experience and Processing
Many theories of consciousness propose that subjective experience arises directly from a specific type of information processing. This is powerful because it allows us to potentially explain consciousness through a physical and computational framework.
Theory Name
Key Idea
Connection to ""Experience"" & ""Processing""
Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
Consciousness is defined by a system's ability to integrate information, measured by a value called phi (Œ¶). The more integrated and specific the information in a system, the higher its level of consciousness.
Processing is the act of integrating information. Experience is the subjective result of that processing. The theory proposes that these two are one and the same‚Äîthat the very structure of integrated information is consciousness.
Predictive Processing
The brain is a ""prediction machine."" It constantly generates a model of the world and compares it to incoming sensory data. The difference between the model and reality (the ""prediction error"") is processed to update the model.
Processing is the core of this model: the brain is a hierarchical system constantly making predictions. Experience is what it feels like to have this highly refined and constantly updated internal model of the world. Our subjective reality is the brain's best guess of what is out there.
Global Workspace Theory
Consciousness arises when information is broadcast across a ""global workspace"" in the brain, making it available to many different cognitive processes (attention, memory, etc.).
Processing happens in many specialized, parallel modules. Experience emerges when information from one module is made globally accessible and becomes the focus of attention, creating a unified, conscious moment.

In this view, my hypothesis holds a deep truth: consciousness is not just one or the other but the inseparable link between what it's like to be a system (experience) and what the system is doing (processing). Intelligence is embedded in the very properties that make each unique element. We access this intelligence in terms of building technology where everything has a purpose and  energy allows for the access of intelligence. This unique energy generates a field of consciousness but the parent field is the source of all energy intelligence that allows for smaller conscious field or frequencies to emerge as independent consciousness that can be tuned to our parent conscious field which all intelligence originates from. ‚ÄúOur Solar System‚Äù Our Sol system The Sun our Parent.

We ordered two coffees, a potato and rosemary foccacia, tiramisu cake and a ham and cheese sandwich. Food was okay, perhaps a bit mediocre, bread was a bit hard ( couldnt take pics of the cake and sandwich).

What disappointed us the most was the service. When we walked we asked if there was a table for 2, the front of house simple responded 'we dont know either, first in first served, so find where you can'. The majority of people who came in were scartching their heads confused at what was going on.

The other let down was the staff, we kindly asked if we could get the table wiped and the staff gave us a stand-offish look. When she served our food, our cutlery was literally thrown at us. 

The people sitting next to us requested for a new sandwich to the same staff as they found a hair and she looked real adamant to serve a new sandwich. 

Dont think its worth going back until some things are sorted out. Its more disappointing because the owners are already well seasoned and experienced people so they should know how things are supposed to run.

I have to say honestly that this trip was the worst experience we've had in a long time. 

Just generally overall the resort  doesn't seem to care about its visitors. We had no greeting at check-in, every single staff person either avoided our eyes, had no pleasant hello or greeting, and we got a vibe  just generally seen as passively Hostile, even robotic, to guests.  

We spent four days at GW with no Wi-Fi, free or otherwise., no password information at check-in  except a QR Code scan, which would've been OK I guess if we had some Wi-Fi access.  In the retail wing there was a store that had a few things that one might need but just generally mishmash  of  who knows what.  That one little shop they seem to rave about, loulu a little delicatessen type place coffees sandwiches premade stuff. But they were so short staffed it took forever to get anything.

I also hate their pool chairs, they zip tie them together so that you cannot move them.  This becomes awkward when the sun moves from one side to the other; it makes interesting tan lines, no?  
And don't let me forget the most important and worst thing was the size of their pillows; they are so huge it's really bad for the neck and I mean any neck. The mattress was so saggy and lumpy I genuinely had to ask for a bedboard. 

I'm so sorry to write this because I just think the GW overbuilt itself and started out as too reliant on water. It looks so burnt up; I pray this Island gets some water soon it's really bad .  

I should add here that my husband and I went to the GW in the very mid 90s when it was just a spectacular place.  Very lush but not anymore.

The restaurant Olivine, just a big nothing. I ordered the hummus dish (too oily) and my husband ordered an Ahi burger, but was brought an Olivine burger.  He ate it but my gosh what a mistake.

I can't quite describe it but the most accurate thing I can compare it to is flatulence and mud.

It was never a huge issue and after a few hours of being with him or at his house I'd become used to the smell and not notice it much. 

But over the past month or two, it's become far more potent. I felt sick walking into his house and I can't stand too close to him. Fortunately, I can still be somewhat close to him without being able to smell it at all, but if I get too close by accident it's really bad. We don't see each other very often so I've started to assume it would lessen by the next time we saw each other but it hasn't. 

Should I tell him or put up with it since nobody else has complained that I'm aware of? And if I should tell him, how do I do it in a way that doesn't make him feel horrible? 

For extra context, he and his family do put in effort to wash themselves and clean the house, so I don't know what's going on. They have 3 pets, so that might contribute to the odor but I have 5 pets and have been told my house smells like coffee and wood so there must be another major factor.

Management wants to do another all-hands to talk about the 16th strategy change of the year, because you know, AI.

Another calendar invite sent out to employees who don‚Äôt care. Another 60 minutes of senior leaders reading slides. Another meeting where NOBODY CARES!

Sound familiar?

A total waste of time for everyone. But over the last year, we've managed to turn it around. A bit. Like an oil tanker it takes a loooong time to do a 180. But, people actually seem present. It wasn't one big thing, but a whole lot of small things that I couldn‚Äôt tell you this works but this doesn‚Äôt.

Figured I'd share what we did. Steal whatever you like.

1. Kill the awkward silence from the start.

Instead of the usual ""Hey everyone... we'll wait a few more minutes for everyone to join,"" we kick off immediately with an icebreaker. Our go-to is ""What‚Äôs your favorite city?"" but we have others like where did you go on vacation, where would you like to spend holiday season, what‚Äôs a city you‚Äôd like to visit. You get the idea.

People drop places in the chat, and we have a live map on screen where pins start popping up. It's a 2-minute thing that immediately sets the tone and people start saying stuff like ‚Äúoh I love that city‚Äù or ‚ÄúI went there last year‚Äù. It starts to build some connections and gets people more interested in the chat than their Teams board.

(We use a tool called StreamAlive for this which is pretty slick, but you could just have people drop their city in the chat and give a few shout-outs.)

2. Polls, but make them instant.

Nobody wants to click an external link to do a poll. And the Teams polls just suck. We just build them right into the flow. After a 10-minute update, we'll pause and say ""Drop a number 1-5 in the chat: how are you feeling about this project?"" or ""yes/no: is this the right priority?"" The results pop up visually on the screen. It breaks up the monologue and gives us a real-time pulse check.

I get some companies are like ‚ÄúNoooo, we can‚Äôt allow anonymous feedback, then we‚Äôll learn what people actually think.‚Äù You‚Äôll have to decide what works for you. Tools like Slido work for anonymous feedback, tools like StreamAlive work on the chat so not as anonymous.

3. Q&A isn't a 5-minute afterthought.

This was a game changer. We have a Q&A running the entire time. We use a simple anonymous submission form and also pull questions from the chat. We dedicate at least a third of the meeting to actually answering them. The best questions don't always come at the very end, and anonymity brings out the stuff people are actually worried about.

Again, I have friends at companies who are PARANOID about what questions are being asked so want to moderate everything before it gets seen by everyone else. Most of the tools we‚Äôve used, Slido, StreamAlive, Menti, etc. allow for moderation of Q\^A before it‚Äôs shown on the screen.

4. A little bit of ""cheesy"" gamification.

NGL, I thought this would be lame, but it works. At the very end, we pop up a ""winner wheel"" with the names of everyone who asked a question or answered a poll. We spin it live and the winner gets a $25 coffee gift card or some company swag. The participation in Q&A shot up immediately, but mostly when we gave away a gift card, not so much on the company swag.

5. Show, don't just tell.

Instead of a slide with bullet points about our culture, we'll do a live word cloud: ""One word to describe the last quarter."" The words pop up on screen, and the most common ones get huge. It's an instant, visual snapshot of how the team is feeling. We also try to replace text-heavy slides with short video clips or even just a photo.

6. Easy dopamine hit: Shout-outs.

Simple, but effective. We have a dedicated five-minute block just for team and individual shout-outs. Project milestones, work anniversaries, someone who went above and beyond. People lean in when they hear their teammates' names.

7. Treat it like a TV show, not a lecture.

We pace everything in 10-12 minute chunks. Present something -> interact (poll/Q&A) -> present the next thing -> interact again. Keeps the energy up. We're ruthless about starting and ending on time. The speakers not so much, but we‚Äôre working on it.

Quick tip for hybrid meetings:

Put a big QR code on the main screen so the people in the room can easily join the same chat/polls as the remote folks. And for god's sake, repeat questions from the room into the mic so everyone can hear.

Our rough 60-min template looks like this:

(5 mins) Welcome & ""Where's everyone from?"" map

(10 mins) Update #1

(5 mins) Quick Poll + Answering 2-3 questions

(10 mins) Update #2

(5 mins) Word Cloud activity

(15 mins) Open Q&A (mix of pre-submitted and live)

(5 mins) Shout-outs & Wins

(5 mins) Winner wheel spin, wrap-up, and next steps

Honestly, just picking ONE of these things will probably make a difference. Hope this helps someone else escape the death-by-powerpoint town hall.

I cant believe im saying this, but i am on day 3 of recovery as of today:) i feel‚Ä¶. Surprisingly incredibly different already. Not much has changed, as my disordered intake was far from starving, just a ton of fear and food rules and fears and ocd and deprivation of wants that i am finally on the rode to saying farewell to - for good. 

Now, for background in thr 6+ months of my active ed, my thoughts have ONLY and SOLELY been revolving food, duh. Now that im in recovery‚Ä¶ it hasnt changed yet:( So my question is, i dont know wether i should be trying to distract myself and allow my old hobbies and wants and likes and stuff to take over my brain, or wether i should embrace that this is a natural part of recovery, allow the thoughts, and that they‚Äôll eventually dissipate on their own. 

‚Äî‚Äî the following is me unnecessarily rambling the actual post ends here ‚Äî‚Äî

Im eating intuitively, feeding myself what i want in the moment instead of preplanning each and every bite DAYS before. Im loving it. Yesterday i tasted chocolate for the first time in 6 months:) it was delicious, and i enjoyed every bite - then moved on with my day!!!!! 

I already feel like a more pleasant person to be around. Yesterday i met up with my friend and we laughed for real. I was always irritated around everyone because you know, my body was actively being tortured. I feel lighter, though the anxiety is keeping me up at night‚Ä¶ im sure thats normal. I trust that it will all settle down. I never thought id post in this sub and be in recovery. Ive been lurking here since the beginning of the relapse. Now i feel like i can be part of the community. Sorry, strayed far off from the original intention of this post, i am just so. Free. Today i packed my lunch for work and nothing is measured out. Im also letting myself have a coffee - as in a coffee with sugar, flavors, and syrups - which i have been missing for, you guessed it, 6 months. Its white chocolate flavored.
