1l2ozz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotelsreviewed/comments/1l2ozz3/my_list_of_10_amazing_hotels_in_mexico_city_i/,My list of 10 amazing hotels in Mexico City I considered (stayed at #1!),"I just got back from a week in Mexico City and wanted to share my hotel shortlist, in case it helps anyone else. Before the trip, I probably spent more time researching hotels than I should‚Äôve ‚Äî I compared Booking.com reviews, Google Maps locations, Reddit threads, and YouTube walk-throughs. 

I ended up staying at #1 on this list, but every single hotel here made my final cut for different reasons ‚Äî design, location, vibes, or value.

If you're visiting soon and want a list from someone who went down the research rabbit hole, here it is.

# 10 Best Hotels in Mexico City

# 1. Casa Polanco Hotel Boutique (The one I stayed at)

I booked this boutique hotel in Polanco, and it was easily one of the best hotel experiences I‚Äôve had anywhere. It's tucked into a quiet, leafy street just a short walk from Parque Lincoln and the best restaurants in Polanco. The hotel is small and elegant ‚Äî think classic European charm with warm, modern touches. My room was big, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the staff treated me like family. Every morning started with a beautifully plated breakfast in their glass conservatory. It‚Äôs not cheap, but honestly, it felt like good value considering the experience.

# 2. Hotel Carlota

Hotel Carlota was high on my list for its cool design and younger, creative energy. It‚Äôs located in Cuauht√©moc, near Reforma Avenue, which means you're close to both the financial district and more local neighborhoods like Ju√°rez and Roma. The standout here is the concrete-and-glass pool right in the courtyard ‚Äî totally Instagram-worthy. Rooms are minimalist but stylish. This place felt ideal for solo travelers or creative types looking for something a bit edgy and non-traditional.

# 3. Z√≥calo Central Hotel

If you want to be right in the heart of the city‚Äôs history, this is the spot. Located just off the main square (the Z√≥calo), this hotel gives you rooftop views of the cathedral and presidential palace. The building is colonial-style, but the interiors are modern and clean. It gets rave reviews for the restaurant and staff. This was my top pick for a more ""classic sightseeing"" base. Great if it‚Äôs your first time in CDMX and you want to be surrounded by history.

# 4. Ignacia Guest House

Located in Roma Norte, Ignacia is more like a design lover‚Äôs dream than a typical hotel. It only has a handful of rooms, each one styled differently and with insane attention to detail ‚Äî think mid-century furniture, local art, and private terraces. Breakfast is served in a garden courtyard and is made fresh daily by an in-house chef. I almost booked this one, but it was full on my dates. If you‚Äôre into boutique, intimate, and *gorgeous*, this is the one.

# 5. NH Collection Mexico City Centro Hist√≥rico

Another strong pick in the city center. NH Collection blends a sleek, modern hotel experience with an unbeatable location. It‚Äôs great for business travelers or tourists who want convenience and comfort without too much flair. You‚Äôre within walking distance of most major historic attractions, and the hotel itself feels polished, quiet, and professional. Good breakfast, nice rooftop terrace, and great soundproofing ‚Äî which you *will* appreciate in Centro.

# 6. Camino Real Polanco

I included this because it‚Äôs architecturally iconic ‚Äî designed by Ricardo Legorreta in the 1960s. The place has a bit of a resort feel with lush courtyards, water features, and several on-site restaurants. It‚Äôs bigger and more corporate than the others on this list, but still stylish in a retro-modern way. The location is great for exploring Chapultepec Park and museums. I‚Äôd recommend this for couples or families who want a balance between comfort and culture.

# 7. Hotel MX Roma

This was my top budget-friendly option in Roma Norte. It‚Äôs clean, simple, and in a great location ‚Äî perfect if you want to walk to coffee shops, mezcal bars, and bookstores. Rooms are compact, but modern, and there‚Äôs a little gym and co-working space too. For travelers who want to be in a cool neighborhood without spending a fortune, this place checks the boxes.

# 8. Four Seasons Hotel Mexico City

If you're looking to go all out, this is the most luxurious option on the list. It sits on Paseo de la Reforma and has a stunning interior courtyard with a fountain, trees, and full-on sanctuary vibes. Service is impeccable (as you'd expect), and the spa is one of the best in the city. Pricey, yes ‚Äî but if it‚Äôs a honeymoon, special occasion, or you just want to be pampered, this is the spot.

# 9. Downtown Mexico

This hotel lives in a beautiful 17th-century building that‚Äôs been transformed into a design-forward space with concrete walls, high ceilings, and rooftop vibes. It‚Äôs located in Centro Hist√≥rico but feels like a trendy hideaway. The rooftop bar and pool are major draws, and it‚Äôs walking distance to many cultural sites. Great pick for those who want a little edge with their comfort.

# 10. Hotel Stanza

This was my no-frills, budget backup option in Roma. The rooms are straightforward but clean, and the location is awesome ‚Äî close to everything in Roma without the noise of staying directly on a busy street. It‚Äôs ideal for travelers who care more about location and reliability than design.

# Best Areas to Stay in Mexico City

# Polanco ‚Äì Upscale & Leafy

This is one of the city‚Äôs wealthiest and safest areas. It‚Äôs home to luxury hotels, Michelin-starred restaurants, and museums like Museo Soumaya and Museo Jumex. If you want quiet nights, high-end shops, and classy caf√©s, this is the place.

# Roma Norte ‚Äì Hip & Walkable

My personal favorite. Roma is full of charm ‚Äî tree-lined streets, craft cocktail bars, art galleries, and vintage bookstores. It has a mix of locals and travelers, and it‚Äôs super pedestrian-friendly. Perfect if you want a ‚Äúlive like a local‚Äù vibe.

# Condesa ‚Äì Chill & Green

Neighboring Roma, Condesa is just a bit more laid-back. It has big parks, brunch spots, and beautiful Art Deco buildings. Feels residential, safe, and low-key, especially if you‚Äôre looking for somewhere relaxing.

# Centro Hist√≥rico ‚Äì Classic & Central

If you‚Äôre coming to see the main landmarks, Centro puts you right next to the action: Z√≥calo, Templo Mayor, Palacio de Bellas Artes. It‚Äôs busy and vibrant, but less calm at night ‚Äî great for history lovers.

# Coyoac√°n ‚Äì Quirky & Cultural

South of the city center, Coyoac√°n feels like a small town inside a megacity. It‚Äôs best known for Frida Kahlo‚Äôs Casa Azul, cobblestone streets, and a more bohemian pace. Not ideal for nightlife, but beautiful for a slower stay.

1l2ow5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bunnyxxxl/comments/1l2ow5r/quiting_smoking/,Quiting smoking,"About 2 months ago I stopped smoking cigarettes and tobacco of any kind with no replacements of any kind, just straight up cold turkey method and it was easier than I thought it's gonna be, I actually had no headaches, no anxiety, no irritation. Just a bit sleepy all day because whenever I smoke I drink coffee or tea. And when I stopped smoking I had to stop everything that leads to it like the last two. 
After 2 weeks still there's still no issues with me physically or mentally and after 2 weeks I was already back to coffee and tea because it's my fuel lol. But I was questioning if it's easy like this for everyone but they haven't actually tried yet? 
So I made my researches and I found out that my body type is an ectomorph and this body type has high metabolism and the researches suggested that I may found this experience easier than expected because nicotine and cigarettes ingredients gets digested pretty quick and makes the withdrawal symptoms easier but not all people can go cold turkey, and succeed. 
If you been a smoker and you had this experience let me know because.... WTF? is everything a lie these days? ",1,1748988355.0,u_bunnyxxxl,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been working on a small project for the past couple of months that helps ecommerce brands (especially solo founders or dropshippers) create ad-style visuals in seconds ‚Äî using just a product image and a short prompt like:



>‚ÄúOn a white desk with a Macbook and coffee cup‚Äù

>‚ÄúModel holding the bottle in a bright kitchen‚Äù

>‚ÄúFloating sneaker with neon background‚Äù



The idea came from my own frustration: every time I wanted to test a product with Facebook Ads, I‚Äôd either wait days for content, overpay for a designer, or settle for ugly mockups.

So I built a tool that does it in under a minute ‚Äî kinda like ChatGPT, but for ad creatives.

Right now it generates:

* Scroll-stopping image ads (feed format)
* UGC-style scenes with AI models
* Lifestyle mockups that match your brand vibe
* All from one product image + text prompt

I‚Äôm still testing it out and improving it every day. But before I go further, I‚Äôd really love some help from the community:

üëâ **If you run an ecommerce store or ads ‚Äî what do you actually need when it comes to creative?**

Do you struggle more with getting UGC? Ad variation? Matching your brand style? Do you want videos, not images? Or maybe you hate writing prompts?  


Let me know in the comments what *you* would need from a tool like this ‚Äî or what would make this genuinely helpful for your workflow.  


No pitch, not selling anything right now. Just building and learning. Thanks in advance ‚ù§Ô∏è

1l2ouid,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l2ouid/its_raining_inside_of_my_soul/,It‚Äôs raining inside of my soul.,"Hello, everyone!

I‚Äôve debated doing this for a while now, but since I can‚Äôt afford therapy, I‚Äôm just going to vent to all you lovely strangers on the internet instead. I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm looking for by doing this exactly. Maybe comfort? Encouragement? Something.

(Strap in, because this is likely going to be a little long-winded.)

Honestly, I‚Äôm not even sure where to start. This year has already been so stressful for me, and we‚Äôre only halfway through. While there are quite a few things I could talk about, the main ones that have been weighing heavily on my heart and mind are all the friendship troubles I‚Äôve been having lately.

There are two main situations I‚Äôve been dealing with and one overarching problem that‚Äôs been following me for the past however long. To start, back at the very end of last year, I (21F) decided to cut someone out of my life (for religious reasons) (no, I‚Äôm not here to discuss religion, I just thought it was an important detail to note) that I had known for roughly five years (we‚Äôll call them Ash).

I was probably like a best friend to them, even though they were only a ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù to me (I think of friendship as having levels) (basically, I was probably higher up on their ‚Äúfriendship scale‚Äù than they were for me, if that makes sense).

While I realise I probably could have handled things differently (and honestly, better), this whole situation is still affecting me and our once-shared friend group even now. 

One of our shared friends (who I‚Äôll call Hannah) has been best friends with Ash since they were both in middle school, and when I last talked with them, they seemed quiet (more-so than usual) and distant. 

(Honestly, while I don‚Äôt intend to cut ties with them, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they decided to cut ties with me, since they and Ash are so close.)

Then, there‚Äôs our other shared friend, who I‚Äôll call David. David seems very eager to patch things up between all of us, and from what I can tell, is honestly trying to see where I‚Äôm coming from, despite not being Christian themself (again, not trying to start anything).

While I do appreciate this, I have no intentions of reconciling with Ash, and I keep trying to tell David that it‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äútalking it out‚Äù. Aside from this small issue, they and I still seem to be on mostly good terms, despite some slight tension regarding this.

The second situation I‚Äôve been dealing with has me going through the stages of grief over and over again. Basically, last spring, I found out that one of my best friends (who I‚Äôll call Alex) was joining the Marines and would be getting deployed sometime between September 2024 and January 2025. While I had my concerns, I tried to be as supportive as I could and left it at that.

Months went by of them still not being deployed before January rolled around and things suddenly changed. Now, their life was suddenly filled with meetings, work, and other commitments, and they were far too busy to make time for me like they used to.

(For context, we used to get coffee together nearly every Sunday after church.)

Keep in mind, this is someone I‚Äôve known since my age was in the single digits and is more like family to me than my own family. We were there for each other in some pretty low moments, and were present in so many shared core memories.

But now, they‚Äôve gone from making time for me to not responding to any of my texts. Not only that, but the last two times I‚Äôve seen them at church, the vibes have been significantly different with them.

The first time was back in March. I was on spring break and thought they had already been deployed, as maybe they weren‚Äôt allowed to have their phone or were too busy doing whatever they do in the Marines to keep up with responding to anyone‚Äôs messages.

But lo and behold, once I stepped into the lobby, there they were, sitting on one of the armchairs, drawing. Immediately upon seeing them, a wave of emotions flooded over me: Happiness, sadness, anger, and most of all, confusion.

What were they doing here? If they hadn‚Äôt been deployed yet, why weren‚Äôt they answering any of my texts? Pushing everything down, I went up to them and tried to pretend like nothing was wrong.

But once I got their attention, I saw something flash across their face. Happiness? Surprise? Fear? I still don‚Äôt know, but it seemed like they weren‚Äôt expecting to see me there and quickly checked their phone (likely to see if I had texted them, which if that‚Äôs true, means they are, in fact, reading my messages and just not responding).

After that, it seemed like the upbeat, goofy Alex I once knew had been replaced by someone tired, sad, and just completely drained of their spark (which would make sense with them being busy with Marines prep).

On top of that, there seemed to be a distance between us that I was not ready for, and once they left, a wave of bittersweet sadness washed over me, much like I was grieving the loss of a loved one.

(I also told them to reach out if they wanted to hang out while I was still on break, and as I‚Äôm sure is a surprise to no one, they didn‚Äôt.)

The second time was this past Sunday. I had heard from my father a few weeks ago that Alex and their family were out of town, which meant I wasn‚Äôt really expecting to see them at church, as I thought they had finally been deployed.

But once again, after the service was over, I saw my mother talking with both Alex and their mom, which made an overwhelming wave of emotion wash over me. After taking a moment to compose myself privately, I found them again just as they were getting ready to leave.

This time, they seemed happy to see me (and less tired), but still like they were eager to leave and rather distracted with some other commitment they needed to deal with.

After a very brief conversation with them, I discovered that they and their family would be going on lots of trips this summer, which meant they would be busier than ever. I also told them to reach out if they had any free time whatsoever, as we‚Äôve basically missed the last five and a half months of each other‚Äôs lives, and I want to update them on mine.

I didn‚Äôt get an answer from them as to whether they would reach out or not, but they did mention something about a bonfire at their parents‚Äô house. Unfortunately, it was just loud enough in the lobby that I didn‚Äôt catch any further details of when it would be happening, which sucks.

But then they left, and I‚Äôve been in a weird headspace ever since. It seems to come in waves, but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm grieving our friendship all over again. Oh, and the best part? They‚Äôve been active online with making and posting art these past five and a half months, which means they clearly still have free time to do things they enjoy.

But anytime I reach out (which, granted, has been few and far between), I am met with radio silence, which isn‚Äôt like them. Usually, if they didn‚Äôt respond within a few hours, they would at least reach out a few days later and see that they missed my text (which has happened before). 

While I do understand that life happens and texts get forgotten, mine are still going through, and Alex is doing absolutely nothing on their part to reach out like they used to. Honestly, as much as I want to have a face-to-face conversation about everything that‚Äôs been happening lately, I find I‚Äôm a little hesitant to reach out again.

What‚Äôs the point of trying to text them if they‚Äôre just going to ignore me? And are they really as busy as they claim to be, or are they using it as an excuse to ignore me? If so, why? I keep trying to think back on every interaction we‚Äôve had within the past year or so, and I can honestly say, I don‚Äôt know what I could have done wrong.

I‚Äôm not a perfect person by any means, and this whole situation has revealed some things to me that I need to heal from, but I at least thought I was a good friend (especially to them). This whole thing feels like some weird stress dream that I can‚Äôt wake up from; it honestly feels a little surreal.

I keep waiting for a text that is likely never going to come through, and though I keep praying about it, I find I don‚Äôt have peace about any of this. I think I care far too much about them to let our friendship go, but I know that if that‚Äôs what they want, then there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it.

I understand that some people are only meant to be in my life for a season, rather than a lifetime, but I didn‚Äôt think that would apply to one of my best friends. Just because we‚Äôre both going down our own paths of life doesn‚Äôt mean we need to separate completely, right?

It just hurts dealing with all of this. They were one of the only people I hung out with, and now they might as well not even exist. I know I‚Äôm not entitled to anyone‚Äôs time, energy, or responses, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs asking too much for a heads up letting me know that they‚Äôre going to be busy and when they‚Äôd be free to hang out, or a text telling me that they want us to go our separate ways.

I can‚Äôt help but feel like they‚Äôre avoiding me, which really hurts. I wish I could go back to a year ago and warn myself that this was going to happen, but I know time isn‚Äôt going to bend to my will just because I‚Äôm unhappy with how things are now. 

Honestly, I think if we were able to have a face-to-face conversation that would clear up most (if not all) of the emotions I‚Äôve been feeling, as the main thing that‚Äôs been bothering me is the striking lack of communication.

But even more than that, I just want my best friend back. I miss them so much.

Anyway, this brings me to my final point: The Overarching Problem‚Ñ¢. To put it plainly, my entire adult life I have been the only one reaching out and trying to plan hangouts with people. Very rarely (if ever) am I invited to go out or even sent a text checking up on me.

While I may not always be the best at remembering to reach out to check on people, when I plan a hangout, I am intentional and make that person my top priority. Unfortunately, even when I do plan hangouts, at least 50% of the time they end up either getting rescheduled or cancelled altogether because the person either completely forgets, has a scheduling conflict, or has some other excuse.

(If I had a dollar for every time someone overslept and missed a preplanned hangout and/or was late, I would have enough money to buy at least twenty candy bars.)

I know that most of my friends have their own issues and lives to deal with, and I try to be understanding of that, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt feel like they respect me or my time with how often problems seem to come up. Maybe I need to grow more of a backbone and speak up on this more often, but I don‚Äôt know if it will even help at this point.

Along with that, I don‚Äôt feel like I truly have many people I can call friends. Like yeah, I have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, but we‚Äôre not all that close, or they live too far away, or they‚Äôre too busy and never ask to hang out, etcetera, etcetera. Why is making and maintaining quality friendships so difficult? Why am I the only one who seems to be putting any effort into things?

It‚Äôs exhausting and quite disheartening giving and rarely ever getting anything in return. But to be honest, I‚Äôve never really known anything else (except for when Alex and I talked like we used to), so it makes me wonder if things will always be this way.

I want someone to think of me and reach out without me having to ask them to. I want them to want to hang out with me, not because I asked them first, but because they genuinely crave and enjoy my company.

Sometimes I wonder if people even remember I exist. Or are they too caught up in their own lives to think of me? I know I‚Äôm not a perfect person, but I do try. I try so hard to connect with others and plan hangouts, and I‚Äôm never met with the same energy in return.

Despite all of this, part of me refuses to give in or give up hope that maybe, just maybe someone is out there who feels the same way. Maybe in time we will cross paths and we will become the closest and truest friend each other has ever had. 

But what if I‚Äôve been put here to feel people‚Äôs pain and never find relief for my own? What if I‚Äôm meant to give comfort to others and never find it for myself? What if I‚Äôm here to be a giver and never a receiver?

It feels like no matter how much time I spend with God or how many people I surround myself with, I‚Äôm still just the same, lonely, little girl standing out on the playground, watching her peers make friends and fun memories without her.

I‚Äôm just tired of always being lonely, always feeling heavy, always hurting and grieving over a friendship that never was and quite possibly, never will be. When did everyone decide that growing up meant they needed to neglect others? When did having long lasting friendships turn into ‚Äúevery person for themself‚Äù?

I know it has to get better at some point, but right now, it really hurts. I wish I had something to look forward to this summer and friends to share it with, but I don‚Äôt. Maybe this is God‚Äôs way of telling me I need to spend more time with Him. Who knows?

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED Talk. :)

I know some people are going to say that is is Ai or fake, and I have no reason to right this other than to get it off my chest) 

I didn't know my dad for most of my life. My mom told me he left when he found out about her pregnancy, despite that I never really hated him for that. I wanted to meet him. I moved out of my mom's apartment when I was 24 and out of college. I used my I saved of from my work to buy an apartment. Around this time I began looking for my dad through the internet and I was able to find the city he lived in and his social media.

 I contacted him through his Instagram and we started talking, and I liked talking to him, and it sounds stupid reading this over but I never told him I was his daughter. We continued talking and nou talking became more personal, he told me about his life, his job, his dating life, but everytime he asked me about my life I lied. I made up stories about my life, I said I grew up with both parents and lied about the reason I contacted him. 

Looking back on that point in my life, I realised that I was afraid to tell him the truth because I thought he would leave. This sounds so cliche and it is, but it hurts me to read this and tink I could have a genuine platonic relationship with him if I didn't lie. 

 We talked through social media for a while before he asked to meet me. I took a train to Chicago and met with him a coffee shop. We were on a date and I hadn't realised it, it didn't click that he invited a woman he had no relationship with out for coffee. I didn't think at least until the end that he thought of me that way. We talked for a while, a long while and I never brought up the fact that he was my father.

 Our conversation lasted like over an hour and during that time he would touch my had or my arm I a way that made me uncomfortable it felt like he  was getting closer to me even though he didn't move from his seat. I realised that he thought this was a date, he must have realised something was wrong with me and he said something that I don't remember. 

I don't know why but I whispered to he and told him I was his daughter. He responded with something like ""oh that's  a weird joke"" or something like that but I just repeated what I said and said that he was uncomfortable. I showed him some pictures of the website I was planning to send him, and got mad rightfully. He left the shop, I couldn't contact him on his social media for two weeks now I have tried looking for people close to him to contact but I couldn't find anyone. This all happened like a few months ago and at this point I don't care anymore and just want to get past this part of my life.",3,1748988202.0,confession,0,1.0,False

One minute I was lying on the couch with my cat in my lap, and the next, I was halfway down Main Street with my backpack on and no real reason to be outside. The sky was‚Ä¶ off. Like it hadn‚Äôt decided whether to be day or night. Just a dull sheet of gray, stretched tight across town like someone had pulled the world‚Äôs bedsheet crooked.

I wasn‚Äôt scared. Not yet. Just unsettled. Like I‚Äôd missed something important.

I passed the flower shop. The bakery. A place that used to be a record store and now sells candles shaped like fruit. I nodded at Mrs. Keegan watering her windowsill roses‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt look up.

And then I saw the coffee shop.

The windows were fogged, except for one. Crystal clear, like it had been scrubbed just for me. It looked normal‚Äîtoo normal. Like someone had printed a photo of the shop and glued it to the glass with trembling hands.

Elvira was curled up on the counter in her blanket nest. The chalkboard had today‚Äôs special written in Tiffany‚Äôs blocky, rushed handwriting. Everything was exactly where it belonged.

Except‚Ä¶ I was looking at it through the reflection.

And Gerald was standing inside.

No‚Äînot inside. In the reflection. Only there.

He was behind the counter, bent slightly forward like he was reading the pastry labels. And then he turned. And he looked at me.

His lips moved, slow and exact, shaping words like a prayer no one should hear. Over and over again.

I couldn‚Äôt read them. I didn‚Äôt want to.

My hands went cold.

I looked behind me‚Äîno one. I looked back at the glass‚Äîhe was still there. Same strange smile, same too-slow blink, same quiet, endless whisper.

And that‚Äôs when he waved. Slow. Like someone waving goodbye to a photo they were about to burn.

I blinked, hard. The real shop was empty. But in the glass, Gerald was still watching. Elvira lifted her head and stared at him too.

And then I saw it. My reflection wasn‚Äôt there.

Just him. Just Elvira. Just the window that remembered me.

I have one who seems like she can‚Äôt stand for me to do things for anyone but her. It‚Äôs extremely bizarre, and it destroys my productivity. Some examples:

I was setting up a room for a conference one day in February. I was literally carrying a table above my head. She stepped in front of me to tell me she needed to plan an event that wasn‚Äôt happening until October. She didn‚Äôt move until she gave me the names of five venues and three keynote speakers to contact. After the event, when I got to my office and contacted the venues and speakers, she changed her mind about what city she wanted to have it in and said we had plenty of time to plan it.

During a different conference, I was helping the guest speaker connect her laptop. Boss comes in, takes guest speaker‚Äôs laptop, shoves it at me, and demands I make a spreadsheet. 

I was on the phone with one of our stakeholders, and she came to me and shoved a coffee cup in my face, demanding I showed her adult aged daughter how to use the Keurig. The stakeholder thought I was working from home, talking to my kids and made a complaint about how unprofessional I was. 

Our big, big boss sent a reminder that some important financial documents were due, and that I couldn‚Äôt be disturbed while I completed them. The needy boss in question pulled a chair up to my desk and demanded I worked on another project. 

My question for the managers is, what is the most respectful way your employees can come to you to tell you that you‚Äôre asking too much of them at terrible times?

I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 months and I found out that I was pregnant last week with his child. Some backstory: We started dating because we met through mutual friends two years ago and out of the blue he asked me to go on a date. I really wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship and I also was exploring my sexuality with women, but the date was super fun and we kept hanging out. He asked me to be his girlfriend a few weeks later and I said yes. Two weeks after we started dating, I got laid off from my job. It was a huge shock because I had been there for 3 years and was performing well. I took the lay off in stride and got another (better) offer¬† less than 2 months later. During my unemployment, I had a few rough days, but overall I was motivated and we had a lot of fun together still. He even would tell me ‚ÄúYou have been so fun during your unemployment, you‚Äôve taken it really well‚Äù.¬†



About a month ago, after I got the job offer, I decided to start taking the weight loss injections called tirzepitide. I just wanted to lose about 20 pounds and I was struggling with emotionally eating because of my layoff. I wanted a little boost to jumpstart getting back into shape. The first week on tirzepatide went really well, I felt AMAZING and I was being super active. Week 2 was alright. I lost my hunger, but I still felt good. That week my boyfriend brought me on a dinner date and after the date he told me that ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been being snappy ever since you started tirzepatide‚Äù. I asked him for an example and he couldn‚Äôt really give me any besides some moments that I was sassy lol. He wanted to keep arguing so I told him I agreed to disagree and moved on. Week 3 was a disaster‚Ä¶ I started feeling extremely nauseous and fatigued. I was so nauseous that I barely could eat. EVERY smell made me feel nauseous. I couldn‚Äôt drink coffee (my fav drink) anymore or even smell chicken without gagging. I was so exhausted I worked from my bed for two weeks (I‚Äôm a remote worker). I napped in between meetings and did absolutely nothing after work. No working out, no walks with my dogs, no plans with friends. I was so sick that I had no interest in doing anything besides lay in my bed. I felt horrible!¬† I thought it was just side effects from the tirzepatide and tried to push through. I got my doctor to prescribe me zofran because my boyfriend and I planned a weekend beach trip for our 3 month anniversary. I was feeling better on the zofran, but still felt off. Our trip was fun. It was super relaxing and I slept in late everyday. We agreed on the way home from the trip that we should plan another one because we had such a great time.¬†



The Tuesday after our trip, I still felt off.¬† I decided to take a pregnancy test and it was positive. I took 7. And they were all positive. My boyfriend and I had already talked about if I did get pregnant, we both wanted an abortion. I called him immediately that morning and told him. All he could say was ‚Äúdamn‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre pregnant‚Äù. Nothing caring or reassuring. Meanwhile, I am crying because I‚Äôm worried about what that means for me and my body. I‚Äôve never been pregnant before, so I was super concerned. He told me he‚Äôd come over after work and order dinner. He came over and pulled a chair up next to my bed to sit in like I was some sort of hospital patient. He rolled a joint and smoked weed and played on his phone. He usually lays in my bed with me. He was in a weird mood and was bickering with me about nothing important. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to bicker anymore and he called me stupid. I asked him if he was still going to order food and he said he already did. He didn‚Äôt even ask me what I wanted. He ordered something I didn‚Äôt like and I told him I didn‚Äôt want it. He ordered the pizza I wanted after but he sent it to his own house so it never came. I dozed off sleeping and when his pizza came he grabbed it and told me he was going to leave.¬†



The next day (Wednesday), I texted him in the morning that I was upset about the day before and I wish he would‚Äôve showed more care for me like maybe bringing flowers or snacks over and making sure dinner was right. He agreed and said he‚Äôd do better. Later that day he showed up to my house unannounced with flowers and a picture frame with our picture in it. We hung out for 30 minutes and then said he was leaving to hang out with his friends because he canceled his plans to hang out with me yesterday (the day I found out I was pregnant). I went to bed alone. Thursday I was again battling fatigue, nausea, and my emotions all while working. He texted me and I forgot to respond, but I was really not able to look at my phone much.¬†



Friday I called him during lunch to talk and everything seemed fine. I was planning on taking the first pill that afternoon. I texted him when I took it at 1pm and he said he was going to come by after work. He showed up at 3pm unannounced at my house (he gets off work around 5pm). I opened the door and he said we need to talk. He seemed angry. He walked into my house and asked me what was going on between us. I said nothing I‚Äôm literally mid abortion lol. He said my location was off the night before and I‚Äôm a liar. I said that maybe my phone died during the night because I wasn‚Äôt really on it and I‚Äôve been so tired and sleeping alot. He said I‚Äôve been lying about so many things and that just because I‚Äôm having an abortion I have no right to be a bitch. He proceeded to tell me that I‚Äôve been ‚Äúgoing through stuff since we‚Äôve been dating: lay off, tirzepatide and pregnancy and that he‚Äôs gone through nothing and it‚Äôs not fair‚Äù. I was pretty taken aback by this because I thought I was doing a good job of not taking things out on others; I go to therapy every week and try to better myself (he does not). He said I‚Äôm a liar over and over and that I‚Äôm so wrong for telling him he‚Äôs not empathetic and compassionate right now. I stopped him and asked what he wanted out of this conversation and what he came over to my house for. He had no answer. He continued on about how it‚Äôs so depressing how I‚Äôm laying in bed watching movies and playing spider solitaire on my laptop. Like wtf does he think I should do rn? He kept roasting me and I told him to leave my house. I slammed the door behind him.¬†



The next day, Saturday I took the rest of the abortion pills and experienced the worst pain of my life. Alone. Laying on the floor of my bathroom. My boyfriend has not contacted me since he came over Friday. Now it is Tuesday and he has still not reached out. At all.

>I'm looking for a birthday gift for my early 40's sister in law. She is a wife, mom, college professor,caregiver to a parent, travels a lot for work, and is generally always on the go. She doesn't drink alcohol, and enjoys tea rather than coffee. She likes desserts but doesn't enjoy chocolate. Over the years, I have given her fragrance, lotions and body oils, earrings, tea and tea accessories, gear for her favorite teams, etc. She's lovely, but we aren't close, so I don't really know much about her current wants or needs. I asked my brother (her husband) and of course he's no help. I want to give her a gift that is helpful or meaningful to a high achieving, busy working wife and mother. Maybe something that will make her life easier or offer her comfort during stressful times. Thanks for your help!

1l2olc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l2olc4/that_face/,That face,"The constant hum of my laptop was the soundtrack of my life. At thirty-one, my apartment, here, at the edge of the city, was less a home and more an annex to my university office. The digital clock struck 4:11 a.m. when my eyes snapped open, no alarm needed. The mental to-do list was already operational: grading forty-seven Advanced Calculus exams, preparing the elliptical curves presentation for grad school, and advancing my research grant application. I knew the faculty considered me ""ambitious"" for a woman my age, and that pressure, that desire to prove them wrong, kept me going.

I got up, my body protesting the few hours of sleep. The fridge, as usual, was practically empty. A carton of sour milk and an apple about to give up. I made myself a strong coffee, my first shot of the day, while my mind was already racing. I'm Samanta R√≠os, Dr. Samanta R√≠os, a full professor of cryptography at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. My world is numbers, unbreakable logic, mathematical certainty.

By four-forty, I was already in front of the screen, the external darkness broken only by the bluish glow of the monitor. My fingers flew across the keyboard, unraveling codes, writing equations. I had a class at seven, then three back-to-back meetings, a quick lunch, if any, with a colleague, and more classes in the afternoon. At night, it was thesis reviews and, if I had any energy left, a couple more hours of research for my own publication. David, my partner of five years, had messaged me last night: ""We should see each other. I miss you."" I read it, of course. But the reply got lost in a whirlwind of algorithms and deadlines.

I felt a slight throb in my right temple, a barely perceptible echo of exhaustion. I ignored it. Nothing new. It was just another sign that my body, unlike my mind, occasionally asked for a truce. But there was no possible truce. Not yet.

The week blurred into an endless series of deadlines and caffeine bursts. Monday dawned with the weight of the 47 Advanced Calculus exams, as I said before. Tuesday was tutoring day. From eight in the morning until one in the afternoon, my office was a procession of students with anxious eyes and doubts. One by one, I unraveled their mental knots, solving equations as if they were the simplest code, while my own energy drained away. Afterward, two undergraduate classes back-to-back, where fatigue forced me to lean more on the projector than on chalk. That night, David called me. ""Sam, are you still alive? I was wondering if today..."" ""Sorry, David, I'm buried. Tomorrow, maybe?"" The frustration in his voice was like a small scratch. I hung up with a promise to myself to call him the next day, a promise I knew I'd break. The throb in my right temple now came with a tension in my jaw.

Wednesday brought the presentation of my grant proposal for new research. I entered the room with that mix of adrenaline and exhaustion, knowing that every word, every slide, was a personal exam. The faculty's ""experts,"" mostly old men with decades of experience, looked at me. I lectured with impeccable precision, answering questions with crushing speed and logic, I knew it. The pressure to prove myself, to be the exception to the rule of men in numbers, only men... it was a knot in my stomach. I left the meeting with a bittersweet victory and a feeling that my head, somehow, was compressed from the inside. The throb in my temple had intensified, now a prick that made me squint. I had to force concentration in my next class.

Thursday was a whirlwind of emails. Hundreds. Replies to students, coordination with other departments, deadline reminders. I ate a dry sandwich in front of the screen. That afternoon, during a curriculum planning meeting, I felt a constant pressure behind my eyes. My colleagues' voices seemed distant, as if they were speaking underwater. I tried to take notes, but the words in my notebook blurred at times. The throb was no longer a throb; it was a dull, sharp explosion every few minutes, as if someone were driving an icy awl directly into my bone. I thought about taking a pill, but I'd already forgotten where I'd left the package.

Friday morning arrived with an unbearable pressure in my skull. I woke up with the throb in my temple, but now it was constant, a knife slowly turning in my head. I tried to get up, but a sudden dizziness made me fall back onto the bed. The light filtering through the curtains was a physical pain that tore at my eyes. The numbers that were once my refuge now buzzed in my head, a meaningless cacophony. I knew I had to teach my morning class, but the mere thought of moving, of facing the light, of processing information, produced unbearable pain. My body, finally, had rebelled. The pain became so intense that nausea overwhelmed me. This wasn't just any migraine; I felt too sick, as if I were being tortured. It was a constant throb of pain, I felt like my skull was being stabbed with a sharp, red-hot knife, again and again.

The phone vibrated incessantly. Messages from the university, maybe David too. But the sound, each vibration, was another blow to my head. With what little strength I had left, I dragged myself to the kitchen. I needed something, anything. The floor seemed to move beneath my feet. The last thing I remember is the cold of the tiles and a darkness that didn't come from sleep, but from a pain that was completely devouring me.

The darkness didn't last. Not the kind of darkness of deep sleep, but a dense, heavy void that dissolved with the distant sound of a voice. It was David. My eyes opened with superhuman effort. The ceiling was white, impersonal, and the constant hum of a machine beside me was a perpetual intrusion. The smell of disinfectant irritated my nose, a chemical puff that made me nauseous. I was on a gurney, my arms bare and cold, and an IV line protruded from my left hand like a strange extension.

""Samanta, can you hear me?"" David's voice was filled with concern, the same concern I'd tried to ignore in his messages the past few days. His face, framed by dark, somewhat disheveled hair, looked blurry at first, then clear. He was pale, and his eyes, always so expressive, shone with an anxiety that broke my heart. He was there.

""What... what happened?"" My voice came out as a raspy whisper. My mouth tasted like metal.

""You scared me to death, Sam. You weren't answering your phone, you wouldn't open the door. I had to force the lock. I found you on the kitchen floor. You were unconscious for a while. I came straight here."" He squeezed my hand, a gesture that felt strangely distant.

A dull pain still lingered in my head, a burning ember that had calmed, but not extinguished. A woman dressed in white, a nurse, approached with a kind smile, though her eyes reflected the tired efficiency of someone who had seen too much. She checked the IV and took my pulse.

""Mrs. R√≠os, welcome back,"" she said in a professional voice. ""You've had a severe migraine episode, combined with dehydration and extreme exhaustion. The doctor will be here in a moment.""

David looked at me, his relief almost palpable. ""I told you, Sam. You need to stop. You've been working too much.""

His words, at any other time, would have echoed my own excuses. But now, as I tried to process the information, my mind's logic felt strangely slippery. ""Chronic stress,"" I repeated in my head.

The doctor arrived, a young man with thin glasses and a serious demeanor. He asked questions about my migraine history, my lifestyle, my diet, my sleep hours. I answered with the raw truth: too little of this, too much of that. He made some movements with a flashlight in front of my eyes, checked my reflexes. It was the first time in a long time that I felt someone, other than myself, scrutinized the functioning of my own system with such attention.

""Mrs. R√≠os, after the basic tests and what David tells us... and what you yourself describe... we're dealing with a clear case of chronic stress. Your body has reached its limit. Migraines are a severe warning symptom,"" he explained in a grave but understanding tone. ""You need absolute rest. We're going to give you a few days off work. No university, no work. Zero. Let your mind completely disconnect. You need leisure, rest... otherwise, this could have more serious long-term consequences.""

He handed me a prescription for something stronger for the migraines and a recommendation for a stress management therapist. David nodded, his face softening slightly with hope. ""I'll take you home. I'm going to take care of you,"" he said, his voice comforting.

As he helped me up, the gurney creaking under my weight, my head felt light, my body as if it didn't quite belong to me. ""Chronic stress,"" echoed in my ears. But what if it was more than that? The exit from the hospital was a blur. The city air, noisy and polluted, seemed denser, almost unbreathable. David guided me, his hand on my back, but it wasn't the same touch as always. It was a shadow, an imitation. An absurd idea, a spark in my exhausted mind. It was just stress, right?

The trip back to my apartment was a blur, a tunnel of blurry lights and the constant ringing in my ears. David was talking, his voice trying to be comforting, but every word sounded a little more distant. When we entered the building, the familiarity of the hallways felt strange. It was my building, of course, but the colors were duller, the shadows denser. A sense of unreality, I thought, a product of the painkillers and exhaustion.

David helped me sit on the sofa. My body was a heavy mass. He went to the kitchen, looking for water, something light to eat. I watched him move, a familiar silhouette, but something... something didn't fit. His gestures were the same as always, but the way he moved, the way his hair fell over his forehead when he bent down, wasn't *him*. It was David, of course it was. We'd been together for five years. I knew every mole on his skin, every inflection of his voice. It was absurd. A hallucination from fatigue, a distortion. I closed my eyes, trying to clear my mind. I'm a mathematician. A cryptographer. My brain is designed for order, for finding patterns, for deciphering the truth hidden in chaos. This was chaos, but it had no logic. It wasn't a code I could break.

When David returned with a glass of water and a cookie, his smile felt rehearsed. He handed it to me. Our fingers brushed, and a shiver ran through me. His skin... it was David, yes, but the texture, the temperature... it wasn't what I remembered. I forced myself to drink the water, feeling it slide down my throat as if it were a strange liquid.

""You need to rest, Sam. I'm going to stay here for a while. Do you need anything else?"" he asked, his voice sounding through a veil.

I looked at him again. His eyes. They were David's, the hazel color, the shape... but there was a coldness, an emptiness I didn't recognize. A subtly different glint that chilled my skin and twisted my gut. It was like seeing a perfect copy, a three-dimensional hologram that perfectly replicated every detail, but lacked the *soul* of the original.

""I'm fine,"" I managed to stammer, my voice barely a whisper. My head ached, yes, but it wasn't the migraine. It was this thought, this nauseating idea trying to break through into my mind: *That's not David*. My brain fought against the idea... it's the stress, the medication, the lack of sleep... my own mind, betraying me. It must be that. It couldn't be that the man I had loved for five years, with whom I had shared my life, my dreams, my secret codes, wasn't... him.

I tried to reason. How could it not be him? It's impossible. He found me, brought me here, he's taking care of me. Everything's normal, right? But the doubt, a small but insistent off-key note in the symphony of my logic, began to resonate. I looked at David, who was now talking on the phone, probably with my mother. His profile was identical. His voice, the tones, the pauses... identical. But it wasn't him. The conviction didn't come as an explosive revelation, but as a slow, chilling seep, a constant leak in the structure of my reality. My David, the real one, wasn't there. And the man now moving through my living room, looking at me with eyes that resembled his, was... an impostor.

David took me to bed. My head still ached, but it was a dull, resonant pain, the kind that, though surreptitiously, remains present... a pain that doesn't prevent you from going on with life, but also doesn't let you forget it's there. David brought me one of his old shirts to sleep in, soft and with his familiar scent. He tucked me in, his hands gentle.

""Rest, Sam. I'm staying. Your mother was very worried. I told her I'd take care of you.""

I looked at him. His hazel eyes returned my gaze, but something in them was still... alien: A copy. My mind screamed ""impossible,"" but the feeling, that icy certainty, had lodged itself deep in my brain. I closed my eyes. Maybe it was fatigue. Yes, it must be extreme fatigue. Rest was the key. I would rest, disconnect, and my logic would return to its place. The impostor would vanish with the exhaustion.

The following days were a purgatory... I was in one of Dante's circles of hell. David moved around my apartment, preparing light meals, making sure I took my medication, forcing me to watch movies and not touch a single math book. Every interaction was a test. He spoke of our shared memories, of inside jokes, of future plans. He behaved exactly like David. But... his laugh sounded a bit hollow, his hugs, a bit stiff, the way his fingers gripped the coffee cup wasn't David's, my David's. It was a minuscule, ridiculous detail, but my brain registered it as a flaw in the pattern.

I tried to ignore it. I forced myself to smile, to nod, to interact. I searched for the real David in his gestures, in his words, in the sparkle in his eyes, desperate to erase that strange feeling of unease. But the image of the impostor solidified a little more each time I looked at him. I felt trapped in a code I couldn't decipher, an absurd equation that told me two plus two wasn't four. The hours dragged on. Television bored me, my favorite crime novels, the ones I missed due to my responsibilities and frantic life... now seemed insignificant. Rest, far from clearing my mind, left me alone with that obsession. I needed a distraction, something to anchor me to reality, something my mind could solve. Numbers. Students. My work. That was real.

Halfway through my leave, I made a decision. ""David,"" I said one morning, my voice firmer than I felt. ""I can't take this anymore. I need to go back to the university. I need my routine, my work.""

He frowned. ""Samanta, the doctor said...""

""The doctor said stress. And this,"" I pointed to my head, ""this is stress from doing nothing. I need my brain occupied. Numbers are my therapy.""

David, worried but yielding to my insistence, took me back to campus the next day. The familiar smell of old paper and coffee from the faculty enveloped me. It was a balm. Here, among my equations and my students, everything would return to normal. Mathematical certainty would erase the illusions.

My first scheduled meeting was with Daniel. Daniel, my star student. I'd been with him since he started undergrad, a brilliant young man, a prodigy with numbers, who was now working on his postgraduate thesis under my supervision: a fascinating project on new cryptographic algorithms. He was my prot√©g√©, my project, my academic pride. He had always been an anchor of sanity in my chaotic life. I entered my office. Daniel was sitting in the visitor's chair, his backpack at his feet, his curly hair and easy smile as always. ""Dr. R√≠os, it's good to see you. I hope you're feeling better.""

I looked at him. His eyes, once filled with an unmistakable spark of intellect and curiosity, now seemed... flat. The way his lips curved into a smile was exact to Daniel's, but there was a rigidity in it, a lack of the spontaneity that always characterized him. The same sensation. The same cold pang. The same silent horror I had felt with David. My mind, which had previously tried to fight the idea with David, now felt more vulnerable, more exposed. It was impossible. Daniel. I knew every nuance of his thinking, every mistake he made at the beginning of a proof, every moment of epiphany. I had invested years in him. He was my student. My prot√©g√©.

""Daniel, you... how are you?"" My voice sounded sharper than I intended.

He tilted his head, his usual gesture. ""Fine, Dr. R√≠os. I made good progress on chapter two of the thesis, actually. Are you ready to review it?""

His voice. His tone. His intonation. Everything was identical. It was Daniel. But it wasn't Daniel. Terror seized me with a force I hadn't felt before. If David was an impostor, if Daniel was too... what did that mean? How was it possible? How could two people, whom I knew so intimately, be replaced by copies so perfect, yet so empty? And why was I, the only one, realizing it?

My brain, the logical machine that had been my strength, now told me that reality was a failed simulation. The hell I had believed to be outside of me began to manifest in my own head. It was the face of my dear student, but the stranger's gaze was so incomprehensible, so... unknown. The revelation about Daniel was a much more brutal blow. David, I could still rationalize as extreme exhaustion, medication, being trapped in an apartment for too long. But Daniel... Daniel was my anchor in pure logic. If he was also an impostor, then the crack in my reality wasn't a temporary flaw; it was an ever-widening gap.

Sitting across from that double of Daniel, my brain went into crisis mode. It was as if an encryption algorithm had catastrophically failed, not just in a message, but in the very infrastructure of the system. How was it possible? In what way? I watched his hands, his gestures as he explained the progress of his thesis. They were perfect. The way he typed on his laptop to show me a code was the same. Every physical detail, every habit. But the energy, the *him* I knew... had disappeared.

My first reaction was that of a cryptographer: to look for the error. Where was the flaw in the matrix? Was there any inconsistency in his words, a lapse, a detail the ""original"" wouldn't have let slip? I questioned him about specific aspects of the project, trick questions about small details or anecdotes from our tutoring sessions. Daniel responded without hesitation, with the same precision and memory as always. There was no error in the code. The code was perfect. *But I knew it wasn't Daniel!*

The paradox drilled into me. How could something be identical yet completely different? My mind screamed for a rational explanation. A replacement? A kidnapping? But how? And why? And why did no one else notice? No one else had seen it, no one else felt it. I was alone in this. The truth, cold as an iceberg, forced itself upon me: I couldn't tell anyone. Not David, not my colleagues, not my mother. They would think I was crazy. Dr. Samanta R√≠os, the young cryptography prodigy, admitted to a psychiatric facility. The thought made my stomach churn. No, no way. I could handle this. I could solve it. My mind, my logic, had gotten me out of countless problems. This was just the most complex puzzle I had ever faced.

The paranoia, which before was an occasional pang with David, now expanded, covering my entire field of vision. Every familiar face I saw in the university hallways, every colleague who greeted me, was a potential threat. Were they too? How many ""impostors"" walked among us? Was this a supernatural torment manifesting through the people closest to me? Or, the most terrifying idea, was it hell in my own head?

I focused on Daniel. He was my new target. I needed to find the proof, the minuscule flaw, the digital fingerprint that would betray him. If I found the error in his code, maybe... just maybe, I could apply that logic to David, to the entire situation. I forced myself to maintain composure, nodding at his explanations about the thesis, my mind devising plans on how to get a sample of his handwriting, how to record his voice, how... I didn't know exactly what I was looking for, but I was looking for *something*. Something my logic could decipher, something that would prove I wasn't losing my mind, but that the world around me had become a failed simulation.

The week passed under the veil of my ""recovery"" and ""normality."" On the outside, I was the same Samanta, the professor who had returned to campus early, eager for work. Inside, I was an obsessive investigator, every interaction a data point... that was for the world. With David, well, I don't know when we had ""decided"" that he would move into my apartment to take care of me. Although, having all his things and him himself helped me gather evidence. I decided to do it subtly, surreptitiously. I would leave his coffee cup in a different place than usual, hoping his hand, by instinct, would go to the ""correct"" place... He didn't. A couple of times, I mentioned anecdotes from our relationship with small altered details, observing his reaction.

""Remember that time at the Italian restaurant, when the bottle of wine fell and the waitress was wearing a green dress?"" I asked him one Tuesday night, while 'David' was preparing dinner. The dress had been blue. He just laughed, ""Yeah, right, a disaster."" Not a hint of doubt.

The authenticity of his response chilled me to the bone. It was as if the impostor had access to all of David's memories, but lacked the *feeling* associated with them. *Maybe he had access to my thoughts?*... if so, proving my hypothesis would be much more complicated.

With Daniel, the dynamic was different. He was my student, my prot√©g√©. Our thesis sessions became my personal laboratory. I asked him questions on tangential topics to his research, looking for a fissure in his brilliance.

""Daniel, do you remember that Turing article you read in your first semester, the one that made you decide on cryptography? What particular phrase struck you?"" I asked him during a tutoring session, my eyes fixed on his. The Daniel I knew would have reflected, perhaps even smiled nostalgically. This Daniel recited a relevant quote, yes, but he did so with an almost robotic precision, without emotion, as if he were accessing a database and reading something he had found. I realized that his usual enthusiasm for the subject, his spark, had disappeared. This was definitely not my student... it was just a very finely crafted version, but to an experienced eye keen on detail, like mine, it was clear from our first interaction. What had they done to Daniel? How could I get him back? Did his family already know?

Sitting in my office, reality raced through my head... Damn it! They weren't just impostors; they were impostors who knew every detail of David's and Daniel's lives, capable of perfectly replicating every memory, every habit... How? Why? My loved ones had been replaced. I... I had to do something, I had to get them back, but how? A sharp, cutting pain returned to my head, hitting my right temple like a dart at full speed... the internal pressure was unbearable. I couldn't speak, I couldn't seek help. They would commit me, drug me, tell me my mind was betraying me... but I was the only one who could see the truth. I was the only one who could get them back.

Subtlety was no longer enough. I needed a reaction that would break the perfect facade those two... had created. With David, the opportunity came one Saturday afternoon. We were watching a movie, a romantic comedy he adored. David, the real one, always cried at the same scene. I approached him at that precise moment.

""David,"" I said, my voice barely a whisper, ""do you remember our first date was at that restaurant, right? The one with the tiny tear-shaped lights... What was the name of the street it was on?"" I had deliberately lied. Our first date had been at a noisy caf√©, and there were no tear-shaped lights.

The impostor tensed imperceptibly. His smile faded.

""Sam, what are you saying? Our first date was at the caf√© downtown. You know that.""

His tone was calm, but there was something... something new in his gaze. A cold glint. His eyes, those hazel eyes I knew, looked at me with an intensity that wasn't love, nor concern, but something akin to resentment, to calculation. The hand holding mine tightened, not with affection, but with a controlled, almost threatening force. He let go of me. His face, immaculate, turned towards the TV screen. But I felt his coldness, and I realized: I couldn't break his facade, but I could irritate him. And in his irritation, an essence that wasn't my David was revealed.

The situation with Daniel escalated a few days later. We were in my office, reviewing the last chapter of his thesis. He was explaining an algorithm, and I interrupted him.

""Daniel, there's something I don't understand,"" I said, my voice tinged with frustration, not about the algorithm, but about the farce. ""Your enthusiasm. Your spark. It's not here. What happened to you? Where's the Daniel who was passionate about this?""

Daniel's face remained impassive. The polite smile stayed, but his eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly.

""Dr. R√≠os, I don't understand. I'm as dedicated as ever. My results prove it."" His tone was flat, without the defensive nuance or genuine curiosity the original Daniel would have shown.

I leaned towards him, my voice dropping to a whisper full of rage and desperation. ""You're not him, are you? Who are you? What did you do to Daniel?""

For an instant, just an instant, the mask on his face cracked. His eyes, previously glassy, lit up with a glacial, primal rage. The smile morphed into something that wasn't a smile, but a disturbing, almost bestial contraction. His hand, which was on the keyboard, tightened, and for a moment I saw his veins bulge. It was the same Daniel, yes, but the energy emanating from him at that moment was not human. It was pure malevolence. I had discovered him, and he knew it.

He immediately composed himself. ""Dr. R√≠os, I think you need more rest. Perhaps the effects of stress haven't worn off yet.""

I pulled away sharply from him. The air in the office had become dense. My heart pounded. They were no longer just doubles; they were dangerous doubles. Capable of rage, of violence... because I had seen the fissure in their disguise. And they knew that I knew...",1,1748987619.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

At thirty-one, my apartment, here, at the edge of the city, was less a home and more an annex to my university office. The digital clock struck 4:11 a.m. when my eyes snapped open, no alarm needed. The mental to-do list was already operational: grading forty-seven Advanced Calculus exams, preparing the elliptical curves presentation for grad school, and advancing my research grant application. I knew the faculty considered me ""ambitious"" for a woman my age, and that pressure, that desire to prove them wrong, kept me going.

I got up, my body protesting the few hours of sleep. The fridge, as usual, was practically empty. A carton of sour milk and an apple about to give up. I made myself a strong coffee, my first shot of the day, while my mind was already racing. I'm Samanta R√≠os, Dr. Samanta R√≠os, a full professor of cryptography at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. My world is numbers, unbreakable logic, mathematical certainty.

By four-forty, I was already in front of the screen, the external darkness broken only by the bluish glow of the monitor. My fingers flew across the keyboard, unraveling codes, writing equations. I had a class at seven, then three back-to-back meetings, a quick lunch, if any, with a colleague, and more classes in the afternoon. At night, it was thesis reviews and, if I had any energy left, a couple more hours of research for my own publication. David, my partner of five years, had messaged me last night: ""We should see each other. I miss you."" I read it, of course. But the reply got lost in a whirlwind of algorithms and deadlines.

I felt a slight throb in my right temple, a barely perceptible echo of exhaustion. I ignored it. Nothing new. It was just another sign that my body, unlike my mind, occasionally asked for a truce. But there was no possible truce. Not yet.

The week blurred into an endless series of deadlines and caffeine bursts. Monday dawned with the weight of the 47 Advanced Calculus exams, as I said before. Tuesday was tutoring day. From eight in the morning until one in the afternoon, my office was a procession of students with anxious eyes and doubts. One by one, I unraveled their mental knots, solving equations as if they were the simplest code, while my own energy drained away. Afterward, two undergraduate classes back-to-back, where fatigue forced me to lean more on the projector than on chalk. That night, David called me. ""Sam, are you still alive? I was wondering if today..."" ""Sorry, David, I'm buried. Tomorrow, maybe?"" The frustration in his voice was like a small scratch. I hung up with a promise to myself to call him the next day, a promise I knew I'd break. The throb in my right temple now came with a tension in my jaw.

Wednesday brought the presentation of my grant proposal for new research. I entered the room with that mix of adrenaline and exhaustion, knowing that every word, every slide, was a personal exam. The faculty's ""experts,"" mostly old men with decades of experience, looked at me. I lectured with impeccable precision, answering questions with crushing speed and logic, I knew it. The pressure to prove myself, to be the exception to the rule of men in numbers, only men... it was a knot in my stomach. I left the meeting with a bittersweet victory and a feeling that my head, somehow, was compressed from the inside. The throb in my temple had intensified, now a prick that made me squint. I had to force concentration in my next class.

Thursday was a whirlwind of emails. Hundreds. Replies to students, coordination with other departments, deadline reminders. I ate a dry sandwich in front of the screen. That afternoon, during a curriculum planning meeting, I felt a constant pressure behind my eyes. My colleagues' voices seemed distant, as if they were speaking underwater. I tried to take notes, but the words in my notebook blurred at times. The throb was no longer a throb; it was a dull, sharp explosion every few minutes, as if someone were driving an icy awl directly into my bone. I thought about taking a pill, but I'd already forgotten where I'd left the package.

Friday morning arrived with an unbearable pressure in my skull. I woke up with the throb in my temple, but now it was constant, a knife slowly turning in my head. I tried to get up, but a sudden dizziness made me fall back onto the bed. The light filtering through the curtains was a physical pain that tore at my eyes. The numbers that were once my refuge now buzzed in my head, a meaningless cacophony. I knew I had to teach my morning class, but the mere thought of moving, of facing the light, of processing information, produced unbearable pain. My body, finally, had rebelled. The pain became so intense that nausea overwhelmed me. This wasn't just any migraine; I felt too sick, as if I were being tortured. It was a constant throb of pain, I felt like my skull was being stabbed with a sharp, red-hot knife, again and again.

The phone vibrated incessantly. Messages from the university, maybe David too. But the sound, each vibration, was another blow to my head. With what little strength I had left, I dragged myself to the kitchen. I needed something, anything. The floor seemed to move beneath my feet. The last thing I remember is the cold of the tiles and a darkness that didn't come from sleep, but from a pain that was completely devouring me.

The darkness didn't last. Not the kind of darkness of deep sleep, but a dense, heavy void that dissolved with the distant sound of a voice. It was David. My eyes opened with superhuman effort. The ceiling was white, impersonal, and the constant hum of a machine beside me was a perpetual intrusion. The smell of disinfectant irritated my nose, a chemical puff that made me nauseous. I was on a gurney, my arms bare and cold, and an IV line protruded from my left hand like a strange extension.

""Samanta, can you hear me?"" David's voice was filled with concern, the same concern I'd tried to ignore in his messages the past few days. His face, framed by dark, somewhat disheveled hair, looked blurry at first, then clear. He was pale, and his eyes, always so expressive, shone with an anxiety that broke my heart. He was there.

""What... what happened?"" My voice came out as a raspy whisper. My mouth tasted like metal.

""You scared me to death, Sam. You weren't answering your phone, you wouldn't open the door. I had to force the lock. I found you on the kitchen floor. You were unconscious for a while. I came straight here."" He squeezed my hand, a gesture that felt strangely distant.

A dull pain still lingered in my head, a burning ember that had calmed, but not extinguished. A woman dressed in white, a nurse, approached with a kind smile, though her eyes reflected the tired efficiency of someone who had seen too much. She checked the IV and took my pulse.

""Mrs. R√≠os, welcome back,"" she said in a professional voice. ""You've had a severe migraine episode, combined with dehydration and extreme exhaustion. The doctor will be here in a moment.""

David looked at me, his relief almost palpable. ""I told you, Sam. You need to stop. You've been working too much.""

His words, at any other time, would have echoed my own excuses. But now, as I tried to process the information, my mind's logic felt strangely slippery. ""Chronic stress,"" I repeated in my head.

The doctor arrived, a young man with thin glasses and a serious demeanor. He asked questions about my migraine history, my lifestyle, my diet, my sleep hours. I answered with the raw truth: too little of this, too much of that. He made some movements with a flashlight in front of my eyes, checked my reflexes. It was the first time in a long time that I felt someone, other than myself, scrutinized the functioning of my own system with such attention.

""Mrs. R√≠os, after the basic tests and what David tells us... and what you yourself describe... we're dealing with a clear case of chronic stress. Your body has reached its limit. Migraines are a severe warning symptom,"" he explained in a grave but understanding tone. ""You need absolute rest. We're going to give you a few days off work. No university, no work. Zero. Let your mind completely disconnect. You need leisure, rest... otherwise, this could have more serious long-term consequences.""

He handed me a prescription for something stronger for the migraines and a recommendation for a stress management therapist. David nodded, his face softening slightly with hope. ""I'll take you home. I'm going to take care of you,"" he said, his voice comforting.

As he helped me up, the gurney creaking under my weight, my head felt light, my body as if it didn't quite belong to me. ""Chronic stress,"" echoed in my ears. But what if it was more than that? The exit from the hospital was a blur. The city air, noisy and polluted, seemed denser, almost unbreathable. David guided me, his hand on my back, but it wasn't the same touch as always. It was a shadow, an imitation. An absurd idea, a spark in my exhausted mind. It was just stress, right?

The trip back to my apartment was a blur, a tunnel of blurry lights and the constant ringing in my ears. David was talking, his voice trying to be comforting, but every word sounded a little more distant. When we entered the building, the familiarity of the hallways felt strange. It was my building, of course, but the colors were duller, the shadows denser. A sense of unreality, I thought, a product of the painkillers and exhaustion.

David helped me sit on the sofa. My body was a heavy mass. He went to the kitchen, looking for water, something light to eat. I watched him move, a familiar silhouette, but something... something didn't fit. His gestures were the same as always, but the way he moved, the way his hair fell over his forehead when he bent down, wasn't *him*. It was David, of course it was. We'd been together for five years. I knew every mole on his skin, every inflection of his voice. It was absurd. A hallucination from fatigue, a distortion. I closed my eyes, trying to clear my mind. I'm a mathematician. A cryptographer. My brain is designed for order, for finding patterns, for deciphering the truth hidden in chaos. This was chaos, but it had no logic. It wasn't a code I could break.

When David returned with a glass of water and a cookie, his smile felt rehearsed. He handed it to me. Our fingers brushed, and a shiver ran through me. His skin... it was David, yes, but the texture, the temperature... it wasn't what I remembered. I forced myself to drink the water, feeling it slide down my throat as if it were a strange liquid.

""You need to rest, Sam. I'm going to stay here for a while. Do you need anything else?"" he asked, his voice sounding through a veil.

I looked at him again. His eyes. They were David's, the hazel color, the shape... but there was a coldness, an emptiness I didn't recognize. A subtly different glint that chilled my skin and twisted my gut. It was like seeing a perfect copy, a three-dimensional hologram that perfectly replicated every detail, but lacked the *soul* of the original.

""I'm fine,"" I managed to stammer, my voice barely a whisper. My head ached, yes, but it wasn't the migraine. It was this thought, this nauseating idea trying to break through into my mind: *That's not David*. My brain fought against the idea... it's the stress, the medication, the lack of sleep... my own mind, betraying me. It must be that. It couldn't be that the man I had loved for five years, with whom I had shared my life, my dreams, my secret codes, wasn't... him.

I tried to reason. How could it not be him? It's impossible. He found me, brought me here, he's taking care of me. Everything's normal, right? But the doubt, a small but insistent off-key note in the symphony of my logic, began to resonate. I looked at David, who was now talking on the phone, probably with my mother. His profile was identical. His voice, the tones, the pauses... identical. But it wasn't him. The conviction didn't come as an explosive revelation, but as a slow, chilling seep, a constant leak in the structure of my reality. My David, the real one, wasn't there. And the man now moving through my living room, looking at me with eyes that resembled his, was... an impostor.

David took me to bed. My head still ached, but it was a dull, resonant pain, the kind that, though surreptitiously, remains present... a pain that doesn't prevent you from going on with life, but also doesn't let you forget it's there. David brought me one of his old shirts to sleep in, soft and with his familiar scent. He tucked me in, his hands gentle.

""Rest, Sam. I'm staying. Your mother was very worried. I told her I'd take care of you.""

I looked at him. His hazel eyes returned my gaze, but something in them was still... alien: A copy. My mind screamed ""impossible,"" but the feeling, that icy certainty, had lodged itself deep in my brain. I closed my eyes. Maybe it was fatigue. Yes, it must be extreme fatigue. Rest was the key. I would rest, disconnect, and my logic would return to its place. The impostor would vanish with the exhaustion.

The following days were a purgatory... I was in one of Dante's circles of hell. David moved around my apartment, preparing light meals, making sure I took my medication, forcing me to watch movies and not touch a single math book. Every interaction was a test. He spoke of our shared memories, of inside jokes, of future plans. He behaved exactly like David. But... his laugh sounded a bit hollow, his hugs, a bit stiff, the way his fingers gripped the coffee cup wasn't David's, my David's. It was a minuscule, ridiculous detail, but my brain registered it as a flaw in the pattern.

I tried to ignore it. I forced myself to smile, to nod, to interact. I searched for the real David in his gestures, in his words, in the sparkle in his eyes, desperate to erase that strange feeling of unease. But the image of the impostor solidified a little more each time I looked at him. I felt trapped in a code I couldn't decipher, an absurd equation that told me two plus two wasn't four. The hours dragged on. Television bored me, my favorite crime novels, the ones I missed due to my responsibilities and frantic life... now seemed insignificant. Rest, far from clearing my mind, left me alone with that obsession. I needed a distraction, something to anchor me to reality, something my mind could solve. Numbers. Students. My work. That was real.

Halfway through my leave, I made a decision. ""David,"" I said one morning, my voice firmer than I felt. ""I can't take this anymore. I need to go back to the university. I need my routine, my work.""

He frowned. ""Samanta, the doctor said...""

""The doctor said stress. And this,"" I pointed to my head, ""this is stress from doing nothing. I need my brain occupied. Numbers are my therapy.""

David, worried but yielding to my insistence, took me back to campus the next day. The familiar smell of old paper and coffee from the faculty enveloped me. It was a balm. Here, among my equations and my students, everything would return to normal. Mathematical certainty would erase the illusions.

My first scheduled meeting was with Daniel. Daniel, my star student. I'd been with him since he started undergrad, a brilliant young man, a prodigy with numbers, who was now working on his postgraduate thesis under my supervision: a fascinating project on new cryptographic algorithms. He was my prot√©g√©, my project, my academic pride. He had always been an anchor of sanity in my chaotic life. I entered my office. Daniel was sitting in the visitor's chair, his backpack at his feet, his curly hair and easy smile as always. ""Dr. R√≠os, it's good to see you. I hope you're feeling better.""

I looked at him. His eyes, once filled with an unmistakable spark of intellect and curiosity, now seemed... flat. The way his lips curved into a smile was exact to Daniel's, but there was a rigidity in it, a lack of the spontaneity that always characterized him. The same sensation. The same cold pang. The same silent horror I had felt with David. My mind, which had previously tried to fight the idea with David, now felt more vulnerable, more exposed. It was impossible. Daniel. I knew every nuance of his thinking, every mistake he made at the beginning of a proof, every moment of epiphany. I had invested years in him. He was my student. My prot√©g√©.

""Daniel, you... how are you?"" My voice sounded sharper than I intended.

He tilted his head, his usual gesture. ""Fine, Dr. R√≠os. I made good progress on chapter two of the thesis, actually. Are you ready to review it?""

His voice. His tone. His intonation. Everything was identical. It was Daniel. But it wasn't Daniel. Terror seized me with a force I hadn't felt before. If David was an impostor, if Daniel was too... what did that mean? How was it possible? How could two people, whom I knew so intimately, be replaced by copies so perfect, yet so empty? And why was I, the only one, realizing it?

My brain, the logical machine that had been my strength, now told me that reality was a failed simulation. The hell I had believed to be outside of me began to manifest in my own head. It was the face of my dear student, but the stranger's gaze was so incomprehensible, so... unknown. The revelation about Daniel was a much more brutal blow. David, I could still rationalize as extreme exhaustion, medication, being trapped in an apartment for too long. But Daniel... Daniel was my anchor in pure logic. If he was also an impostor, then the crack in my reality wasn't a temporary flaw; it was an ever-widening gap.

Sitting across from that double of Daniel, my brain went into crisis mode. It was as if an encryption algorithm had catastrophically failed, not just in a message, but in the very infrastructure of the system. How was it possible? In what way? I watched his hands, his gestures as he explained the progress of his thesis. They were perfect. The way he typed on his laptop to show me a code was the same. Every physical detail, every habit. But the energy, the *him* I knew... had disappeared.

My first reaction was that of a cryptographer: to look for the error. Where was the flaw in the matrix? Was there any inconsistency in his words, a lapse, a detail the ""original"" wouldn't have let slip? I questioned him about specific aspects of the project, trick questions about small details or anecdotes from our tutoring sessions. Daniel responded without hesitation, with the same precision and memory as always. There was no error in the code. The code was perfect. *But I knew it wasn't Daniel!*

The paradox drilled into me. How could something be identical yet completely different? My mind screamed for a rational explanation. A replacement? A kidnapping? But how? And why? And why did no one else notice? No one else had seen it, no one else felt it. I was alone in this. The truth, cold as an iceberg, forced itself upon me: I couldn't tell anyone. Not David, not my colleagues, not my mother. They would think I was crazy. Dr. Samanta R√≠os, the young cryptography prodigy, admitted to a psychiatric facility. The thought made my stomach churn. No, no way. I could handle this. I could solve it. My mind, my logic, had gotten me out of countless problems. This was just the most complex puzzle I had ever faced.

The paranoia, which before was an occasional pang with David, now expanded, covering my entire field of vision. Every familiar face I saw in the university hallways, every colleague who greeted me, was a potential threat. Were they too? How many ""impostors"" walked among us? Was this a supernatural torment manifesting through the people closest to me? Or, the most terrifying idea, was it hell in my own head?

I focused on Daniel. He was my new target. I needed to find the proof, the minuscule flaw, the digital fingerprint that would betray him. If I found the error in his code, maybe... just maybe, I could apply that logic to David, to the entire situation. I forced myself to maintain composure, nodding at his explanations about the thesis, my mind devising plans on how to get a sample of his handwriting, how to record his voice, how... I didn't know exactly what I was looking for, but I was looking for *something*. Something my logic could decipher, something that would prove I wasn't losing my mind, but that the world around me had become a failed simulation.

The week passed under the veil of my ""recovery"" and ""normality."" On the outside, I was the same Samanta, the professor who had returned to campus early, eager for work. Inside, I was an obsessive investigator, every interaction a data point... that was for the world. With David, well, I don't know when we had ""decided"" that he would move into my apartment to take care of me. Although, having all his things and him himself helped me gather evidence. I decided to do it subtly, surreptitiously. I would leave his coffee cup in a different place than usual, hoping his hand, by instinct, would go to the ""correct"" place... He didn't. A couple of times, I mentioned anecdotes from our relationship with small altered details, observing his reaction.

""Remember that time at the Italian restaurant, when the bottle of wine fell and the waitress was wearing a green dress?"" I asked him one Tuesday night, while 'David' was preparing dinner. The dress had been blue. He just laughed, ""Yeah, right, a disaster."" Not a hint of doubt.

The authenticity of his response chilled me to the bone. It was as if the impostor had access to all of David's memories, but lacked the *feeling* associated with them. *Maybe he had access to my thoughts?*... if so, proving my hypothesis would be much more complicated.

With Daniel, the dynamic was different. He was my student, my prot√©g√©. Our thesis sessions became my personal laboratory. I asked him questions on tangential topics to his research, looking for a fissure in his brilliance.

""Daniel, do you remember that Turing article you read in your first semester, the one that made you decide on cryptography? What particular phrase struck you?"" I asked him during a tutoring session, my eyes fixed on his. The Daniel I knew would have reflected, perhaps even smiled nostalgically. This Daniel recited a relevant quote, yes, but he did so with an almost robotic precision, without emotion, as if he were accessing a database and reading something he had found. I realized that his usual enthusiasm for the subject, his spark, had disappeared. This was definitely not my student... it was just a very finely crafted version, but to an experienced eye keen on detail, like mine, it was clear from our first interaction. What had they done to Daniel? How could I get him back? Did his family already know?

Sitting in my office, reality raced through my head... Damn it! They weren't just impostors; they were impostors who knew every detail of David's and Daniel's lives, capable of perfectly replicating every memory, every habit... How? Why? My loved ones had been replaced. I... I had to do something, I had to get them back, but how? A sharp, cutting pain returned to my head, hitting my right temple like a dart at full speed... the internal pressure was unbearable. I couldn't speak, I couldn't seek help. They would commit me, drug me, tell me my mind was betraying me... but I was the only one who could see the truth. I was the only one who could get them back.

Subtlety was no longer enough. I needed a reaction that would break the perfect facade those two... had created. With David, the opportunity came one Saturday afternoon. We were watching a movie, a romantic comedy he adored. David, the real one, always cried at the same scene. I approached him at that precise moment.

""David,"" I said, my voice barely a whisper, ""do you remember our first date was at that restaurant, right? The one with the tiny tear-shaped lights... What was the name of the street it was on?"" I had deliberately lied. Our first date had been at a noisy caf√©, and there were no tear-shaped lights.

The impostor tensed imperceptibly. His smile faded.

""Sam, what are you saying? Our first date was at the caf√© downtown. You know that.""

His tone was calm, but there was something... something new in his gaze. A cold glint. His eyes, those hazel eyes I knew, looked at me with an intensity that wasn't love, nor concern, but something akin to resentment, to calculation. The hand holding mine tightened, not with affection, but with a controlled, almost threatening force. He let go of me. His face, immaculate, turned towards the TV screen. But I felt his coldness, and I realized: I couldn't break his facade, but I could irritate him. And in his irritation, an essence that wasn't my David was revealed.

The situation with Daniel escalated a few days later. We were in my office, reviewing the last chapter of his thesis. He was explaining an algorithm, and I interrupted him.

""Daniel, there's something I don't understand,"" I said, my voice tinged with frustration, not about the algorithm, but about the farce. ""Your enthusiasm. Your spark. It's not here. What happened to you? Where's the Daniel who was passionate about this?""

Daniel's face remained impassive. The polite smile stayed, but his eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly.

""Dr. R√≠os, I don't understand. I'm as dedicated as ever. My results prove it."" His tone was flat, without the defensive nuance or genuine curiosity the original Daniel would have shown.

I leaned towards him, my voice dropping to a whisper full of rage and desperation. ""You're not him, are you? Who are you? What did you do to Daniel?""

For an instant, just an instant, the mask on his face cracked. His eyes, previously glassy, lit up with a glacial, primal rage. The smile morphed into something that wasn't a smile, but a disturbing, almost bestial contraction. His hand, which was on the keyboard, tightened, and for a moment I saw his veins bulge. It was the same Daniel, yes, but the energy emanating from him at that moment was not human. It was pure malevolence. I had discovered him, and he knew it.

He immediately composed himself. ""Dr. R√≠os, I think you need more rest. Perhaps the effects of stress haven't worn off yet.""

I pulled away sharply from him. The air in the office had become dense. My heart pounded. They were no longer just doubles; they were dangerous doubles.

Friday morning arrived with an unbearable pressure in my skull. I woke up with the throb in my temple, but now it was constant, a knife slowly turning in my head. I tried to get up, but a sudden dizziness made me fall back onto the bed. The light filtering through the curtains was a physical pain that tore at my eyes. The numbers that were once my refuge now buzzed in my head, a meaningless cacophony. I knew I had to teach my morning class, but the mere thought of moving, of facing the light, of processing information, produced unbearable pain. My body, finally, had rebelled. The pain became so intense that nausea overwhelmed me. This wasn't just any migraine; I felt too sick, as if I were being tortured. It was a constant throb of pain, I felt like my skull was being stabbed with a sharp, red-hot knife, again and again.

The phone vibrated incessantly. Messages from the university, maybe David too. But the sound, each vibration, was another blow to my head. With what little strength I had left, I dragged myself to the kitchen. I needed something, anything. The floor seemed to move beneath my feet. The last thing I remember is the cold of the tiles and a darkness that didn't come from sleep, but from a pain that was completely devouring me.

The darkness didn't last. Not the kind of darkness of deep sleep, but a dense, heavy void that dissolved with the distant sound of a voice. It was David. My eyes opened with superhuman effort. The ceiling was white, impersonal, and the constant hum of a machine beside me was a perpetual intrusion. The smell of disinfectant irritated my nose, a chemical puff that made me nauseous. I was on a gurney, my arms bare and cold, and an IV line protruded from my left hand like a strange extension.

""Samanta, can you hear me?"" David's voice was filled with concern, the same concern I'd tried to ignore in his messages the past few days. His face, framed by dark, somewhat disheveled hair, looked blurry at first, then clear. He was pale, and his eyes, always so expressive, shone with an anxiety that broke my heart. He was there.

""What... what happened?"" My voice came out as a raspy whisper. My mouth tasted like metal.

""You scared me to death, Sam. You weren't answering your phone, you wouldn't open the door. I had to force the lock. I found you on the kitchen floor. You were unconscious for a while. I came straight here."" He squeezed my hand, a gesture that felt strangely distant.

A dull pain still lingered in my head, a burning ember that had calmed, but not extinguished. A woman dressed in white, a nurse, approached with a kind smile, though her eyes reflected the tired efficiency of someone who had seen too much. She checked the IV and took my pulse.

""Mrs. R√≠os, welcome back,"" she said in a professional voice. ""You've had a severe migraine episode, combined with dehydration and extreme exhaustion. The doctor will be here in a moment.""

David looked at me, his relief almost palpable. ""I told you, Sam. You need to stop. You've been working too much.""

His words, at any other time, would have echoed my own excuses. But now, as I tried to process the information, my mind's logic felt strangely slippery. ""Chronic stress,"" I repeated in my head.

The doctor arrived, a young man with thin glasses and a serious demeanor. He asked questions about my migraine history, my lifestyle, my diet, my sleep hours. I answered with the raw truth: too little of this, too much of that. He made some movements with a flashlight in front of my eyes, checked my reflexes. It was the first time in a long time that I felt someone, other than myself, scrutinized the functioning of my own system with such attention.

""Mrs. R√≠os, after the basic tests and what David tells us... and what you yourself describe... we're dealing with a clear case of chronic stress. Your body has reached its limit. Migraines are a severe warning symptom,"" he explained in a grave but understanding tone. ""You need absolute rest. We're going to give you a few days off work. No university, no work. Zero. Let your mind completely disconnect. You need leisure, rest... otherwise, this could have more serious long-term consequences.""

He handed me a prescription for something stronger for the migraines and a recommendation for a stress management therapist. David nodded, his face softening slightly with hope. ""I'll take you home. I'm going to take care of you,"" he said, his voice comforting.

As he helped me up, the gurney creaking under my weight, my head felt light, my body as if it didn't quite belong to me. ""Chronic stress,"" echoed in my ears. But what if it was more than that? The exit from the hospital was a blur. The city air, noisy and polluted, seemed denser, almost unbreathable. David guided me, his hand on my back, but it wasn't the same touch as always. It was a shadow, an imitation. An absurd idea, a spark in my exhausted mind. It was just stress, right?

The trip back to my apartment was a blur, a tunnel of blurry lights and the constant ringing in my ears. David was talking, his voice trying to be comforting, but every word sounded a little more distant. When we entered the building, the familiarity of the hallways felt strange. It was my building, of course, but the colors were duller, the shadows denser. A sense of unreality, I thought, a product of the painkillers and exhaustion.

David helped me sit on the sofa. My body was a heavy mass. He went to the kitchen, looking for water, something light to eat. I watched him move, a familiar silhouette, but something... something didn't fit. His gestures were the same as always, but the way he moved, the way his hair fell over his forehead when he bent down, wasn't *him*. It was David, of course it was. We'd been together for five years. I knew every mole on his skin, every inflection of his voice. It was absurd. A hallucination from fatigue, a distortion. I closed my eyes, trying to clear my mind. I'm a mathematician. A cryptographer. My brain is designed for order, for finding patterns, for deciphering the truth hidden in chaos. This was chaos, but it had no logic. It wasn't a code I could break.

When David returned with a glass of water and a cookie, his smile felt rehearsed. He handed it to me. Our fingers brushed, and a shiver ran through me. His skin... it was David, yes, but the texture, the temperature... it wasn't what I remembered. I forced myself to drink the water, feeling it slide down my throat as if it were a strange liquid.

""You need to rest, Sam. I'm going to stay here for a while. Do you need anything else?"" he asked, his voice sounding through a veil.

I looked at him again. His eyes. They were David's, the hazel color, the shape... but there was a coldness, an emptiness I didn't recognize. A subtly different glint that chilled my skin and twisted my gut. It was like seeing a perfect copy, a three-dimensional hologram that perfectly replicated every detail, but lacked the *soul* of the original.

""I'm fine,"" I managed to stammer, my voice barely a whisper. My head ached, yes, but it wasn't the migraine. It was this thought, this nauseating idea trying to break through into my mind: *That's not David*. My brain fought against the idea... it's the stress, the medication, the lack of sleep... my own mind, betraying me. It must be that. It couldn't be that the man I had loved for five years, with whom I had shared my life, my dreams, my secret codes, wasn't... him.

I tried to reason. How could it not be him? It's impossible. He found me, brought me here, he's taking care of me. Everything's normal, right? But the doubt, a small but insistent off-key note in the symphony of my logic, began to resonate. I looked at David, who was now talking on the phone, probably with my mother. His profile was identical. His voice, the tones, the pauses... identical. But it wasn't him. The conviction didn't come as an explosive revelation, but as a slow, chilling seep, a constant leak in the structure of my reality. My David, the real one, wasn't there. And the man now moving through my living room, looking at me with eyes that resembled his, was... an impostor.

David took me to bed. My head still ached, but it was a dull, resonant pain, the kind that, though surreptitiously, remains present... a pain that doesn't prevent you from going on with life, but also doesn't let you forget it's there. David brought me one of his old shirts to sleep in, soft and with his familiar scent. He tucked me in, his hands gentle.

""Rest, Sam. I'm staying. Your mother was very worried. I told her I'd take care of you.""

I looked at him. His hazel eyes returned my gaze, but something in them was still... alien: A copy. My mind screamed ""impossible,"" but the feeling, that icy certainty, had lodged itself deep in my brain. I closed my eyes. Maybe it was fatigue. Yes, it must be extreme fatigue. Rest was the key. I would rest, disconnect, and my logic would return to its place. The impostor would vanish with the exhaustion.

The following days were a purgatory... I was in one of Dante's circles of hell. David moved around my apartment, preparing light meals, making sure I took my medication, forcing me to watch movies and not touch a single math book. Every interaction was a test. He spoke of our shared memories, of inside jokes, of future plans. He behaved exactly like David. But... his laugh sounded a bit hollow, his hugs, a bit stiff, the way his fingers gripped the coffee cup wasn't David's, my David's. It was a minuscule, ridiculous detail, but my brain registered it as a flaw in the pattern.

I tried to ignore it. I forced myself to smile, to nod, to interact. I searched for the real David in his gestures, in his words, in the sparkle in his eyes, desperate to erase that strange feeling of unease. But the image of the impostor solidified a little more each time I looked at him. I felt trapped in a code I couldn't decipher, an absurd equation that told me two plus two wasn't four. The hours dragged on. Television bored me, my favorite crime novels, the ones I missed due to my responsibilities and frantic life... now seemed insignificant. Rest, far from clearing my mind, left me alone with that obsession. I needed a distraction, something to anchor me to reality, something my mind could solve. Numbers. Students. My work. That was real.

Halfway through my leave, I made a decision. ""David,"" I said one morning, my voice firmer than I felt. ""I can't take this anymore. I need to go back to the university. I need my routine, my work.""

He frowned. ""Samanta, the doctor said...""

""The doctor said stress. And this,"" I pointed to my head, ""this is stress from doing nothing. I need my brain occupied. Numbers are my therapy.""

David, worried but yielding to my insistence, took me back to campus the next day. The familiar smell of old paper and coffee from the faculty enveloped me. It was a balm. Here, among my equations and my students, everything would return to normal. Mathematical certainty would erase the illusions.

My first scheduled meeting was with Daniel. Daniel, my star student. I'd been with him since he started undergrad, a brilliant young man, a prodigy with numbers, who was now working on his postgraduate thesis under my supervision: a fascinating project on new cryptographic algorithms. He was my prot√©g√©, my project, my academic pride. He had always been an anchor of sanity in my chaotic life. I entered my office. Daniel was sitting in the visitor's chair, his backpack at his feet, his curly hair and easy smile as always. ""Dr. R√≠os, it's good to see you. I hope you're feeling better.""

I looked at him. His eyes, once filled with an unmistakable spark of intellect and curiosity, now seemed... flat. The way his lips curved into a smile was exact to Daniel's, but there was a rigidity in it, a lack of the spontaneity that always characterized him. The same sensation. The same cold pang. The same silent horror I had felt with David. My mind, which had previously tried to fight the idea with David, now felt more vulnerable, more exposed. It was impossible. Daniel. I knew every nuance of his thinking, every mistake he made at the beginning of a proof, every moment of epiphany. I had invested years in him. He was my student. My prot√©g√©.

""Daniel, you... how are you?"" My voice sounded sharper than I intended.

He tilted his head, his usual gesture. ""Fine, Dr. R√≠os. I made good progress on chapter two of the thesis, actually. Are you ready to review it?""

His voice. His tone. His intonation. Everything was identical. It was Daniel. But it wasn't Daniel. Terror seized me with a force I hadn't felt before. If David was an impostor, if Daniel was too... what did that mean? How was it possible? How could two people, whom I knew so intimately, be replaced by copies so perfect, yet so empty? And why was I, the only one, realizing it?

My brain, the logical machine that had been my strength, now told me that reality was a failed simulation. The hell I had believed to be outside of me began to manifest in my own head. It was the face of my dear student, but the stranger's gaze was so incomprehensible, so... unknown. The revelation about Daniel was a much more brutal blow. David, I could still rationalize as extreme exhaustion, medication, being trapped in an apartment for too long. But Daniel... Daniel was my anchor in pure logic. If he was also an impostor, then the crack in my reality wasn't a temporary flaw; it was an ever-widening gap.

Sitting across from that double of Daniel, my brain went into crisis mode. It was as if an encryption algorithm had catastrophically failed, not just in a message, but in the very infrastructure of the system. How was it possible? In what way? I watched his hands, his gestures as he explained the progress of his thesis. They were perfect. The way he typed on his laptop to show me a code was the same. Every physical detail, every habit. But the energy, the *him* I knew... had disappeared.

My first reaction was that of a cryptographer: to look for the error. Where was the flaw in the matrix? Was there any inconsistency in his words, a lapse, a detail the ""original"" wouldn't have let slip? I questioned him about specific aspects of the project, trick questions about small details or anecdotes from our tutoring sessions. Daniel responded without hesitation, with the same precision and memory as always. There was no error in the code. The code was perfect. *But I knew it wasn't Daniel!*

The paradox drilled into me. How could something be identical yet completely different? My mind screamed for a rational explanation. A replacement? A kidnapping? But how? And why? And why did no one else notice? No one else had seen it, no one else felt it. I was alone in this. The truth, cold as an iceberg, forced itself upon me: I couldn't tell anyone. Not David, not my colleagues, not my mother. They would think I was crazy. Dr. Samanta R√≠os, the young cryptography prodigy, admitted to a psychiatric facility. The thought made my stomach churn. No, no way. I could handle this. I could solve it. My mind, my logic, had gotten me out of countless problems. This was just the most complex puzzle I had ever faced.

The paranoia, which before was an occasional pang with David, now expanded, covering my entire field of vision. Every familiar face I saw in the university hallways, every colleague who greeted me, was a potential threat. Were they too? How many ""impostors"" walked among us? Was this a supernatural torment manifesting through the people closest to me? Or, the most terrifying idea, was it hell in my own head?

I focused on Daniel. He was my new target. I needed to find the proof, the minuscule flaw, the digital fingerprint that would betray him. If I found the error in his code, maybe... just maybe, I could apply that logic to David, to the entire situation. I forced myself to maintain composure, nodding at his explanations about the thesis, my mind devising plans on how to get a sample of his handwriting, how to record his voice, how... I didn't know exactly what I was looking for, but I was looking for *something*. Something my logic could decipher, something that would prove I wasn't losing my mind, but that the world around me had become a failed simulation.

The week passed under the veil of my ""recovery"" and ""normality."" On the outside, I was the same Samanta, the professor who had returned to campus early, eager for work. Inside, I was an obsessive investigator, every interaction a data point... that was for the world. With David, well, I don't know when we had ""decided"" that he would move into my apartment to take care of me. Although, having all his things and him himself helped me gather evidence. I decided to do it subtly, surreptitiously. I would leave his coffee cup in a different place than usual, hoping his hand, by instinct, would go to the ""correct"" place... He didn't. A couple of times, I mentioned anecdotes from our relationship with small altered details, observing his reaction.

""Remember that time at the Italian restaurant, when the bottle of wine fell and the waitress was wearing a green dress?"" I asked him one Tuesday night, while 'David' was preparing dinner. The dress had been blue. He just laughed, ""Yeah, right, a disaster."" Not a hint of doubt.

The authenticity of his response chilled me to the bone. It was as if the impostor had access to all of David's memories, but lacked the *feeling* associated with them. *Maybe he had access to my thoughts?*... if so, proving my hypothesis would be much more complicated.

With Daniel, the dynamic was different. He was my student, my prot√©g√©. Our thesis sessions became my personal laboratory. I asked him questions on tangential topics to his research, looking for a fissure in his brilliance.

""Daniel, do you remember that Turing article you read in your first semester, the one that made you decide on cryptography? What particular phrase struck you?"" I asked him during a tutoring session, my eyes fixed on his. The Daniel I knew would have reflected, perhaps even smiled nostalgically. This Daniel recited a relevant quote, yes, but he did so with an almost robotic precision, without emotion, as if he were accessing a database and reading something he had found. I realized that his usual enthusiasm for the subject, his spark, had disappeared. This was definitely not my student... it was just a very finely crafted version, but to an experienced eye keen on detail, like mine, it was clear from our first interaction. What had they done to Daniel? How could I get him back? Did his family already know?

Sitting in my office, reality raced through my head... Damn it! They weren't just impostors; they were impostors who knew every detail of David's and Daniel's lives, capable of perfectly replicating every memory, every habit... How? Why? My loved ones had been replaced. I... I had to do something, I had to get them back, but how? A sharp, cutting pain returned to my head, hitting my right temple like a dart at full speed... the internal pressure was unbearable. I couldn't speak, I couldn't seek help. They would commit me, drug me, tell me my mind was betraying me... but I was the only one who could see the truth. I was the only one who could get them back.

Subtlety was no longer enough. I needed a reaction that would break the perfect facade those two... had created. With David, the opportunity came one Saturday afternoon. We were watching a movie, a romantic comedy he adored. David, the real one, always cried at the same scene. I approached him at that precise moment.

""David,"" I said, my voice barely a whisper, ""do you remember our first date was at that restaurant, right? The one with the tiny tear-shaped lights... What was the name of the street it was on?"" I had deliberately lied. Our first date had been at a noisy caf√©, and there were no tear-shaped lights.

The impostor tensed imperceptibly. His smile faded.

""Sam, what are you saying? Our first date was at the caf√© downtown. You know that.""

His tone was calm, but there was something... something new in his gaze. A cold glint. His eyes, those hazel eyes I knew, looked at me with an intensity that wasn't love, nor concern, but something akin to resentment, to calculation. The hand holding mine tightened, not with affection, but with a controlled, almost threatening force. He let go of me. His face, immaculate, turned towards the TV screen. But I felt his coldness, and I realized: I couldn't break his facade, but I could irritate him. And in his irritation, an essence that wasn't my David was revealed.

The situation with Daniel escalated a few days later. We were in my office, reviewing the last chapter of his thesis. He was explaining an algorithm, and I interrupted him.

""Daniel, there's something I don't understand,"" I said, my voice tinged with frustration, not about the algorithm, but about the farce. ""Your enthusiasm. Your spark. It's not here. What happened to you? Where's the Daniel who was passionate about this?""

Daniel's face remained impassive. The polite smile stayed, but his eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly.

""Dr. R√≠os, I don't understand. I'm as dedicated as ever. My results prove it."" His tone was flat, without the defensive nuance or genuine curiosity the original Daniel would have shown.

I leaned towards him, my voice dropping to a whisper full of rage and desperation. ""You're not him, are you? Who are you? What did you do to Daniel?""

For an instant, just an instant, the mask on his face cracked. His eyes, previously glassy, lit up with a glacial, primal rage. The smile morphed into something that wasn't a smile, but a disturbing, almost bestial contraction. His hand, which was on the keyboard, tightened, and for a moment I saw his veins bulge. It was the same Daniel, yes, but the energy emanating from him at that moment was not human. It was pure malevolence. I had discovered him, and he knew it.

He immediately composed himself. ""Dr. R√≠os, I think you need more rest. Perhaps the effects of stress haven't worn off yet.""

I pulled away sharply from him. The air in the office had become dense. My heart pounded. They were no longer just doubles; they were dangerous doubles. Capable of rage, of violence... because I had seen the fissure in their disguise. And they knew that I knew...",1,1748987555.0,CreepyPastas,0,1.0,False

1l2ok47,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1l2ok47/that_face/,That face,"The constant hum of my laptop was the soundtrack of my life. At thirty-one, my apartment, here, at the edge of the city, was less a home and more an annex to my university office. The digital clock struck 4:11 a.m. when my eyes snapped open, no alarm needed. The mental to-do list was already operational: grading forty-seven Advanced Calculus exams, preparing the elliptical curves presentation for grad school, and advancing my research grant application. I knew the faculty considered me ""ambitious"" for a woman my age, and that pressure, that desire to prove them wrong, kept me going.

I got up, my body protesting the few hours of sleep. The fridge, as usual, was practically empty. A carton of sour milk and an apple about to give up. I made myself a strong coffee, my first shot of the day, while my mind was already racing. I'm Samanta R√≠os, Dr. Samanta R√≠os, a full professor of cryptography at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. My world is numbers, unbreakable logic, mathematical certainty.

By four-forty, I was already in front of the screen, the external darkness broken only by the bluish glow of the monitor. My fingers flew across the keyboard, unraveling codes, writing equations. I had a class at seven, then three back-to-back meetings, a quick lunch, if any, with a colleague, and more classes in the afternoon. At night, it was thesis reviews and, if I had any energy left, a couple more hours of research for my own publication. David, my partner of five years, had messaged me last night: ""We should see each other. I miss you."" I read it, of course. But the reply got lost in a whirlwind of algorithms and deadlines.

I felt a slight throb in my right temple, a barely perceptible echo of exhaustion. I ignored it. Nothing new. It was just another sign that my body, unlike my mind, occasionally asked for a truce. But there was no possible truce. Not yet.

The week blurred into an endless series of deadlines and caffeine bursts. Monday dawned with the weight of the 47 Advanced Calculus exams, as I said before. Tuesday was tutoring day. From eight in the morning until one in the afternoon, my office was a procession of students with anxious eyes and doubts. One by one, I unraveled their mental knots, solving equations as if they were the simplest code, while my own energy drained away. Afterward, two undergraduate classes back-to-back, where fatigue forced me to lean more on the projector than on chalk. That night, David called me. ""Sam, are you still alive? I was wondering if today..."" ""Sorry, David, I'm buried. Tomorrow, maybe?"" The frustration in his voice was like a small scratch. I hung up with a promise to myself to call him the next day, a promise I knew I'd break. The throb in my right temple now came with a tension in my jaw.

Wednesday brought the presentation of my grant proposal for new research. I entered the room with that mix of adrenaline and exhaustion, knowing that every word, every slide, was a personal exam. The faculty's ""experts,"" mostly old men with decades of experience, looked at me. I lectured with impeccable precision, answering questions with crushing speed and logic, I knew it. The pressure to prove myself, to be the exception to the rule of men in numbers, only men... it was a knot in my stomach. I left the meeting with a bittersweet victory and a feeling that my head, somehow, was compressed from the inside. The throb in my temple had intensified, now a prick that made me squint. I had to force concentration in my next class.

Thursday was a whirlwind of emails. Hundreds. Replies to students, coordination with other departments, deadline reminders. I ate a dry sandwich in front of the screen. That afternoon, during a curriculum planning meeting, I felt a constant pressure behind my eyes. My colleagues' voices seemed distant, as if they were speaking underwater. I tried to take notes, but the words in my notebook blurred at times. The throb was no longer a throb; it was a dull, sharp explosion every few minutes, as if someone were driving an icy awl directly into my bone. I thought about taking a pill, but I'd already forgotten where I'd left the package.

Friday morning arrived with an unbearable pressure in my skull. I woke up with the throb in my temple, but now it was constant, a knife slowly turning in my head. I tried to get up, but a sudden dizziness made me fall back onto the bed. The light filtering through the curtains was a physical pain that tore at my eyes. The numbers that were once my refuge now buzzed in my head, a meaningless cacophony. I knew I had to teach my morning class, but the mere thought of moving, of facing the light, of processing information, produced unbearable pain. My body, finally, had rebelled. The pain became so intense that nausea overwhelmed me. This wasn't just any migraine; I felt too sick, as if I were being tortured. It was a constant throb of pain, I felt like my skull was being stabbed with a sharp, red-hot knife, again and again.

The phone vibrated incessantly. Messages from the university, maybe David too. But the sound, each vibration, was another blow to my head. With what little strength I had left, I dragged myself to the kitchen. I needed something, anything. The floor seemed to move beneath my feet. The last thing I remember is the cold of the tiles and a darkness that didn't come from sleep, but from a pain that was completely devouring me.

The darkness didn't last. Not the kind of darkness of deep sleep, but a dense, heavy void that dissolved with the distant sound of a voice. It was David. My eyes opened with superhuman effort. The ceiling was white, impersonal, and the constant hum of a machine beside me was a perpetual intrusion. The smell of disinfectant irritated my nose, a chemical puff that made me nauseous. I was on a gurney, my arms bare and cold, and an IV line protruded from my left hand like a strange extension.

""Samanta, can you hear me?"" David's voice was filled with concern, the same concern I'd tried to ignore in his messages the past few days. His face, framed by dark, somewhat disheveled hair, looked blurry at first, then clear. He was pale, and his eyes, always so expressive, shone with an anxiety that broke my heart. He was there.

""What... what happened?"" My voice came out as a raspy whisper. My mouth tasted like metal.

""You scared me to death, Sam. You weren't answering your phone, you wouldn't open the door. I had to force the lock. I found you on the kitchen floor. You were unconscious for a while. I came straight here."" He squeezed my hand, a gesture that felt strangely distant.

A dull pain still lingered in my head, a burning ember that had calmed, but not extinguished. A woman dressed in white, a nurse, approached with a kind smile, though her eyes reflected the tired efficiency of someone who had seen too much. She checked the IV and took my pulse.

""Mrs. R√≠os, welcome back,"" she said in a professional voice. ""You've had a severe migraine episode, combined with dehydration and extreme exhaustion. The doctor will be here in a moment.""

David looked at me, his relief almost palpable. ""I told you, Sam. You need to stop. You've been working too much.""

His words, at any other time, would have echoed my own excuses. But now, as I tried to process the information, my mind's logic felt strangely slippery. ""Chronic stress,"" I repeated in my head.

The doctor arrived, a young man with thin glasses and a serious demeanor. He asked questions about my migraine history, my lifestyle, my diet, my sleep hours. I answered with the raw truth: too little of this, too much of that. He made some movements with a flashlight in front of my eyes, checked my reflexes. It was the first time in a long time that I felt someone, other than myself, scrutinized the functioning of my own system with such attention.

""Mrs. R√≠os, after the basic tests and what David tells us... and what you yourself describe... we're dealing with a clear case of chronic stress. Your body has reached its limit. Migraines are a severe warning symptom,"" he explained in a grave but understanding tone. ""You need absolute rest. We're going to give you a few days off work. No university, no work. Zero. Let your mind completely disconnect. You need leisure, rest... otherwise, this could have more serious long-term consequences.""

He handed me a prescription for something stronger for the migraines and a recommendation for a stress management therapist. David nodded, his face softening slightly with hope. ""I'll take you home. I'm going to take care of you,"" he said, his voice comforting.

As he helped me up, the gurney creaking under my weight, my head felt light, my body as if it didn't quite belong to me. ""Chronic stress,"" echoed in my ears. But what if it was more than that? The exit from the hospital was a blur. The city air, noisy and polluted, seemed denser, almost unbreathable. David guided me, his hand on my back, but it wasn't the same touch as always. It was a shadow, an imitation. An absurd idea, a spark in my exhausted mind. It was just stress, right?

The trip back to my apartment was a blur, a tunnel of blurry lights and the constant ringing in my ears. David was talking, his voice trying to be comforting, but every word sounded a little more distant. When we entered the building, the familiarity of the hallways felt strange. It was my building, of course, but the colors were duller, the shadows denser. A sense of unreality, I thought, a product of the painkillers and exhaustion.

David helped me sit on the sofa. My body was a heavy mass. He went to the kitchen, looking for water, something light to eat. I watched him move, a familiar silhouette, but something... something didn't fit. His gestures were the same as always, but the way he moved, the way his hair fell over his forehead when he bent down, wasn't *him*. It was David, of course it was. We'd been together for five years. I knew every mole on his skin, every inflection of his voice. It was absurd. A hallucination from fatigue, a distortion. I closed my eyes, trying to clear my mind. I'm a mathematician. A cryptographer. My brain is designed for order, for finding patterns, for deciphering the truth hidden in chaos. This was chaos, but it had no logic. It wasn't a code I could break.

When David returned with a glass of water and a cookie, his smile felt rehearsed. He handed it to me. Our fingers brushed, and a shiver ran through me. His skin... it was David, yes, but the texture, the temperature... it wasn't what I remembered. I forced myself to drink the water, feeling it slide down my throat as if it were a strange liquid.

""You need to rest, Sam. I'm going to stay here for a while. Do you need anything else?"" he asked, his voice sounding through a veil.

I looked at him again. His eyes. They were David's, the hazel color, the shape... but there was a coldness, an emptiness I didn't recognize. A subtly different glint that chilled my skin and twisted my gut. It was like seeing a perfect copy, a three-dimensional hologram that perfectly replicated every detail, but lacked the *soul* of the original.

""I'm fine,"" I managed to stammer, my voice barely a whisper. My head ached, yes, but it wasn't the migraine. It was this thought, this nauseating idea trying to break through into my mind: *That's not David*. My brain fought against the idea... it's the stress, the medication, the lack of sleep... my own mind, betraying me. It must be that. It couldn't be that the man I had loved for five years, with whom I had shared my life, my dreams, my secret codes, wasn't... him.

I tried to reason. How could it not be him? It's impossible. He found me, brought me here, he's taking care of me. Everything's normal, right? But the doubt, a small but insistent off-key note in the symphony of my logic, began to resonate. I looked at David, who was now talking on the phone, probably with my mother. His profile was identical. His voice, the tones, the pauses... identical. But it wasn't him. The conviction didn't come as an explosive revelation, but as a slow, chilling seep, a constant leak in the structure of my reality. My David, the real one, wasn't there. And the man now moving through my living room, looking at me with eyes that resembled his, was... an impostor.

David took me to bed. My head still ached, but it was a dull, resonant pain, the kind that, though surreptitiously, remains present... a pain that doesn't prevent you from going on with life, but also doesn't let you forget it's there. David brought me one of his old shirts to sleep in, soft and with his familiar scent. He tucked me in, his hands gentle.

""Rest, Sam. I'm staying. Your mother was very worried. I told her I'd take care of you.""

I looked at him. His hazel eyes returned my gaze, but something in them was still... alien: A copy. My mind screamed ""impossible,"" but the feeling, that icy certainty, had lodged itself deep in my brain. I closed my eyes. Maybe it was fatigue. Yes, it must be extreme fatigue. Rest was the key. I would rest, disconnect, and my logic would return to its place. The impostor would vanish with the exhaustion.

The following days were a purgatory... I was in one of Dante's circles of hell. David moved around my apartment, preparing light meals, making sure I took my medication, forcing me to watch movies and not touch a single math book. Every interaction was a test. He spoke of our shared memories, of inside jokes, of future plans. He behaved exactly like David. But... his laugh sounded a bit hollow, his hugs, a bit stiff, the way his fingers gripped the coffee cup wasn't David's, my David's. It was a minuscule, ridiculous detail, but my brain registered it as a flaw in the pattern.

I tried to ignore it. I forced myself to smile, to nod, to interact. I searched for the real David in his gestures, in his words, in the sparkle in his eyes, desperate to erase that strange feeling of unease. But the image of the impostor solidified a little more each time I looked at him. I felt trapped in a code I couldn't decipher, an absurd equation that told me two plus two wasn't four. The hours dragged on. Television bored me, my favorite crime novels, the ones I missed due to my responsibilities and frantic life... now seemed insignificant. Rest, far from clearing my mind, left me alone with that obsession. I needed a distraction, something to anchor me to reality, something my mind could solve. Numbers. Students. My work. That was real.

Halfway through my leave, I made a decision. ""David,"" I said one morning, my voice firmer than I felt. ""I can't take this anymore. I need to go back to the university. I need my routine, my work.""

He frowned. ""Samanta, the doctor said...""

""The doctor said stress. And this,"" I pointed to my head, ""this is stress from doing nothing. I need my brain occupied. Numbers are my therapy.""

David, worried but yielding to my insistence, took me back to campus the next day. The familiar smell of old paper and coffee from the faculty enveloped me. It was a balm. Here, among my equations and my students, everything would return to normal. Mathematical certainty would erase the illusions.

My first scheduled meeting was with Daniel. Daniel, my star student. I'd been with him since he started undergrad, a brilliant young man, a prodigy with numbers, who was now working on his postgraduate thesis under my supervision: a fascinating project on new cryptographic algorithms. He was my prot√©g√©, my project, my academic pride. He had always been an anchor of sanity in my chaotic life. I entered my office. Daniel was sitting in the visitor's chair, his backpack at his feet, his curly hair and easy smile as always. ""Dr. R√≠os, it's good to see you. I hope you're feeling better.""

I looked at him. His eyes, once filled with an unmistakable spark of intellect and curiosity, now seemed... flat. The way his lips curved into a smile was exact to Daniel's, but there was a rigidity in it, a lack of the spontaneity that always characterized him. The same sensation. The same cold pang. The same silent horror I had felt with David. My mind, which had previously tried to fight the idea with David, now felt more vulnerable, more exposed. It was impossible. Daniel. I knew every nuance of his thinking, every mistake he made at the beginning of a proof, every moment of epiphany. I had invested years in him. He was my student. My prot√©g√©.

""Daniel, you... how are you?"" My voice sounded sharper than I intended.

He tilted his head, his usual gesture. ""Fine, Dr. R√≠os. I made good progress on chapter two of the thesis, actually. Are you ready to review it?""

His voice. His tone. His intonation. Everything was identical. It was Daniel. But it wasn't Daniel. Terror seized me with a force I hadn't felt before. If David was an impostor, if Daniel was too... what did that mean? How was it possible? How could two people, whom I knew so intimately, be replaced by copies so perfect, yet so empty? And why was I, the only one, realizing it?

My brain, the logical machine that had been my strength, now told me that reality was a failed simulation. The hell I had believed to be outside of me began to manifest in my own head. It was the face of my dear student, but the stranger's gaze was so incomprehensible, so... unknown. The revelation about Daniel was a much more brutal blow. David, I could still rationalize as extreme exhaustion, medication, being trapped in an apartment for too long. But Daniel... Daniel was my anchor in pure logic. If he was also an impostor, then the crack in my reality wasn't a temporary flaw; it was an ever-widening gap.

Sitting across from that double of Daniel, my brain went into crisis mode. It was as if an encryption algorithm had catastrophically failed, not just in a message, but in the very infrastructure of the system. How was it possible? In what way? I watched his hands, his gestures as he explained the progress of his thesis. They were perfect. The way he typed on his laptop to show me a code was the same. Every physical detail, every habit. But the energy, the *him* I knew... had disappeared.

My first reaction was that of a cryptographer: to look for the error. Where was the flaw in the matrix? Was there any inconsistency in his words, a lapse, a detail the ""original"" wouldn't have let slip? I questioned him about specific aspects of the project, trick questions about small details or anecdotes from our tutoring sessions. Daniel responded without hesitation, with the same precision and memory as always. There was no error in the code. The code was perfect. *But I knew it wasn't Daniel!*

The paradox drilled into me. How could something be identical yet completely different? My mind screamed for a rational explanation. A replacement? A kidnapping? But how? And why? And why did no one else notice? No one else had seen it, no one else felt it. I was alone in this. The truth, cold as an iceberg, forced itself upon me: I couldn't tell anyone. Not David, not my colleagues, not my mother. They would think I was crazy. Dr. Samanta R√≠os, the young cryptography prodigy, admitted to a psychiatric facility. The thought made my stomach churn. No, no way. I could handle this. I could solve it. My mind, my logic, had gotten me out of countless problems. This was just the most complex puzzle I had ever faced.

The paranoia, which before was an occasional pang with David, now expanded, covering my entire field of vision. Every familiar face I saw in the university hallways, every colleague who greeted me, was a potential threat. Were they too? How many ""impostors"" walked among us? Was this a supernatural torment manifesting through the people closest to me? Or, the most terrifying idea, was it hell in my own head?

I focused on Daniel. He was my new target. I needed to find the proof, the minuscule flaw, the digital fingerprint that would betray him. If I found the error in his code, maybe... just maybe, I could apply that logic to David, to the entire situation. I forced myself to maintain composure, nodding at his explanations about the thesis, my mind devising plans on how to get a sample of his handwriting, how to record his voice, how... I didn't know exactly what I was looking for, but I was looking for *something*. Something my logic could decipher, something that would prove I wasn't losing my mind, but that the world around me had become a failed simulation.

The week passed under the veil of my ""recovery"" and ""normality."" On the outside, I was the same Samanta, the professor who had returned to campus early, eager for work. Inside, I was an obsessive investigator, every interaction a data point... that was for the world. With David, well, I don't know when we had ""decided"" that he would move into my apartment to take care of me. Although, having all his things and him himself helped me gather evidence. I decided to do it subtly, surreptitiously. I would leave his coffee cup in a different place than usual, hoping his hand, by instinct, would go to the ""correct"" place... He didn't. A couple of times, I mentioned anecdotes from our relationship with small altered details, observing his reaction.

""Remember that time at the Italian restaurant, when the bottle of wine fell and the waitress was wearing a green dress?"" I asked him one Tuesday night, while 'David' was preparing dinner. The dress had been blue. He just laughed, ""Yeah, right, a disaster."" Not a hint of doubt.

The authenticity of his response chilled me to the bone. It was as if the impostor had access to all of David's memories, but lacked the *feeling* associated with them. *Maybe he had access to my thoughts?*... if so, proving my hypothesis would be much more complicated.

With Daniel, the dynamic was different. He was my student, my prot√©g√©. Our thesis sessions became my personal laboratory. I asked him questions on tangential topics to his research, looking for a fissure in his brilliance.

""Daniel, do you remember that Turing article you read in your first semester, the one that made you decide on cryptography? What particular phrase struck you?"" I asked him during a tutoring session, my eyes fixed on his. The Daniel I knew would have reflected, perhaps even smiled nostalgically. This Daniel recited a relevant quote, yes, but he did so with an almost robotic precision, without emotion, as if he were accessing a database and reading something he had found. I realized that his usual enthusiasm for the subject, his spark, had disappeared. This was definitely not my student... it was just a very finely crafted version, but to an experienced eye keen on detail, like mine, it was clear from our first interaction. What had they done to Daniel? How could I get him back? Did his family already know?

Sitting in my office, reality raced through my head... Damn it! They weren't just impostors; they were impostors who knew every detail of David's and Daniel's lives, capable of perfectly replicating every memory, every habit... How? Why? My loved ones had been replaced. I... I had to do something, I had to get them back, but how? A sharp, cutting pain returned to my head, hitting my right temple like a dart at full speed... the internal pressure was unbearable. I couldn't speak, I couldn't seek help. They would commit me, drug me, tell me my mind was betraying me... but I was the only one who could see the truth. I was the only one who could get them back.

Subtlety was no longer enough. I needed a reaction that would break the perfect facade those two... had created. With David, the opportunity came one Saturday afternoon. We were watching a movie, a romantic comedy he adored. David, the real one, always cried at the same scene. I approached him at that precise moment.

""David,"" I said, my voice barely a whisper, ""do you remember our first date was at that restaurant, right? The one with the tiny tear-shaped lights... What was the name of the street it was on?"" I had deliberately lied. Our first date had been at a noisy caf√©, and there were no tear-shaped lights.

The impostor tensed imperceptibly. His smile faded.

""Sam, what are you saying? Our first date was at the caf√© downtown. You know that.""

His tone was calm, but there was something... something new in his gaze. A cold glint. His eyes, those hazel eyes I knew, looked at me with an intensity that wasn't love, nor concern, but something akin to resentment, to calculation. The hand holding mine tightened, not with affection, but with a controlled, almost threatening force. He let go of me. His face, immaculate, turned towards the TV screen. But I felt his coldness, and I realized: I couldn't break his facade, but I could irritate him. And in his irritation, an essence that wasn't my David was revealed.

The situation with Daniel escalated a few days later. We were in my office, reviewing the last chapter of his thesis. He was explaining an algorithm, and I interrupted him.

""Daniel, there's something I don't understand,"" I said, my voice tinged with frustration, not about the algorithm, but about the farce. ""Your enthusiasm. Your spark. It's not here. What happened to you? Where's the Daniel who was passionate about this?""

Daniel's face remained impassive. The polite smile stayed, but his eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly.

""Dr. R√≠os, I don't understand. I'm as dedicated as ever. My results prove it."" His tone was flat, without the defensive nuance or genuine curiosity the original Daniel would have shown.

I leaned towards him, my voice dropping to a whisper full of rage and desperation. ""You're not him, are you? Who are you? What did you do to Daniel?""

For an instant, just an instant, the mask on his face cracked. His eyes, previously glassy, lit up with a glacial, primal rage. The smile morphed into something that wasn't a smile, but a disturbing, almost bestial contraction. His hand, which was on the keyboard, tightened, and for a moment I saw his veins bulge. It was the same Daniel, yes, but the energy emanating from him at that moment was not human. It was pure malevolence. I had discovered him, and he knew it.

He immediately composed himself. ""Dr. R√≠os, I think you need more rest. Perhaps the effects of stress haven't worn off yet.""

I pulled away sharply from him. The air in the office had become dense. My heart pounded. They were no longer just doubles; they were dangerous doubles. Capable of rage, of violence... because I had seen the fissure in their disguise. And they knew that I knew...",1,1748987533.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

I had fallen asleep at my desk, having lost the fight against deadlines. My new book was supposed to reach the editors by the next morning, and I wasn‚Äôt yet done with the ending.

I shuffled in my sleep and winced at the sunlight hitting my face. I jolted up and stared at the mess I was in.

""Fuck fuck fuck, no way. I can't finish this now. They'll sue me, I'll be behind bars!""

I had signed a trilogy deal with the publishers and my third book was long due. My books about goth horror were works of art, but now I was a slave of the corporate world.

I looked up at the painting over my desk. It was Lucifer with his hellhound, a perfect complement to my books.

But this time... something was off.

""What is wrong with this painting now? Did it rain? Did the fucking water seep in? Just drown me and kill me at this point.""

Thud!

I spun around quickly to where the sound came from. One of my books had been knocked off the bedside table.

I got up and walked towards the book.

""You were one of my best, you know? I can't let you down. You deserve a banger of an ending. And I shall bring justice to that. A quick coffee and we'll get to kicking ass, alright?""

I placed the book back and walked out into the kitchen.

The sunny weather made me decide on a cold brew.

""No way it could have rained, what was off with that painting then?""

Bangggg!!

The windows flew open.

""Holy fuck man, damn.""

I shut the window, picked up my cup, and walked back in.

I stood in front of my desk and let my eyes linger on the painting. Lucifer, in a magnificent suit, almost seductive, posing with his hellhound, Ramsey. Lucifer looked proud, but almost endearingly at his dog. Ramsey stood loyal to her master. But something was different.

""There is something missing my eye... the leash is just the same, his suit and shoes the same. Did the background colour change? Was it more red?""

Creeeeak...

The old cupboard opened slowly.

I jumped. The cup dropped from my hands.

""Is that someone in there?""

I grabbed the night lamp. ""I'm not in the right mood, jerk! I'll bash your skull!"" I yelled.

Cautiously, I walked over toward the cupboard, one step at a time. I jumped up in front of it, heart racing, expecting the worst.

Clothes.

Just my clothes. T-shirts, jeans, dresses. Just clothes.

I ruffled through them, hoping not to find anything odd.

Once convinced, I headed back to my table.

The spilled coffee stole more of my precious time.

I walked back to the kitchen to get the broom when I heard my neighbor's dog, Suzy, barking her tiny ass off.

""Would Ramsey be so cute and cuddly with Lucifer too?""

I tripped.

Thwack!!

I landed hard on the floor, having tripped over a stool that was not here before.

""Aaah, Jesus Christ! When did this get here? God, my leg! I'm already shitting myself over this book and now this? Imagine going to jail with a sprained leg! I'm so fucked.""

I got up slowly and, with my courage of iron, managed to clean up and finally settle down at my seat.

I worked religiously on wrapping up my finale. It was dark when I finally raised my head.

""How do I end it now? I need the peace and calm washed off my readers' faces after the last line.""

""Peace and calm washed off their faces... Terrified... Ramsey!""

As I looked up, I finally realized. The background colour was the same. Lucifer was perfect too. But Ramsey‚Äîthe vicious dog, responsible for keeping the dead and damned in hell, away from the world of the living‚Äîlooked different. Ramsey didn't look so ferocious anymore. She looked scared. Guilty. Sad for having disappointed her master. But she also looked terrified for what was about to come.

""How on earth did that happen now?""

And then I felt it.

A weight on the backrest of my chair, and then...

This is a story about what happens when you refuse to accept ""bad luck"" as an answer. When you dig deeper. When you follow your God-given instinct until you find the truth. Even if no one believes you. Even if it means turning your world upside down.

In November 2023, I began experiencing a strange, dull pain in my flank. It was constant‚Äî24/7. It never stopped. I saw 8 or 9 different doctors. All of them dismissed me. Gas. Muscle pain. Stress. They told me I was too young for cancer. They didn‚Äôt take me seriously. I told them something felt wrong‚ÄîI even said the word ‚Äúcancer‚Äù‚Äîand they brushed me off.
Eventually, one doctor referred me to a GI specialist. I told her everything‚Äîabout my persistent heartburn, my esophagitis (Grade C), and that nagging flank pain. She ordered a CT scan. I didn‚Äôt even get a call. I saw the result on MyChart: ""Kidney mass.""

I went numb. Then I went to Google. And I cried for weeks.

Then I went to church. I begged God for answers, for guidance, for truth. I saw five urologists. Two said monitor it. Three said surgery. I chose to try healing naturally for six months. Looking back, I now believe I could have healed‚Äîif I hadn‚Äôt still been actively exposed to the very thing that was making me sick.

In October 2024, I was diagnosed with a renal mass. On April 14, 2025, I had surgery. With kidney cancer, they usually don‚Äôt biopsy‚Äîit‚Äôs too risky. You don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs cancer until it‚Äôs removed. Chemo and radiation don‚Äôt work well on kidney cancer. Surgery is the treatment.

My pathology report: Stage 1, Grade 2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

I was 36. No family history. I don‚Äôt smoke. I don‚Äôt drink. I did full genetic testing for kidney cancer‚Äîit came back completely negative.
When I asked my surgeon what caused it, he said, ‚ÄúJust bad luck.‚Äù

But something about that phrase struck me like lightning. It felt wrong. I don‚Äôt believe in bad luck‚ÄîI believe in divine guidance. In protection. In purpose. There‚Äôs a saying in Portuguese: ""Quem me cuida n√£o dorme""‚Äîhe who watches over me never sleeps.
So I went home and decided: I was going to find the cause. I owed it to my children. I owed it to myself. If I could find the root cause, I could stop it from coming back.

I joined kidney cancer support groups. And what I found shocked me. So many people with Stage 1 kidney cancer had recurrence‚Äî3, 5, 10, 15 years later. How could we be ""cured"" and still be dying?
I have two boys‚Äîages 4 and 2. I couldn‚Äôt accept that fate. That wasn‚Äôt going to be my story.

So I started pulling every test, every lab, every scan I‚Äôd ever done. I uploaded them into ChatGPT. I built a timeline. I connected dots that no doctor was connecting.

And I learned something critical: I have MTHFR and slow COMT. My genes impair my body‚Äôs ability to detox. I hold on to toxins. My system gets overwhelmed easily. That matters in this story.

Then I remembered something my friend Erin told me while doing hyperbaric oxygen therapy. She said mold caused her breast cancer.

At first, when I met Erin back in Otober I tested my house. because of what she said but it came back clean. After surgery, Erin kept sharing some posts about mold with me and this voice inside of me said ‚ÄúTest your body,‚Äù. So I did.

And everything changed.

My Vibrant Wellness mycotoxin test came back with Ochratoxin A‚Äî6x the safe limit‚Äîand DHC, both known carcinogens.

Ochratoxin A is produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium molds‚Äîthe same ones that thrive in cold, damp, enclosed places. 

This wasn‚Äôt from food, coffee, nor grains. This was environmental. Chronic exposure the levels were to high I was being exposed daily to this thing.
So I asked myself: where was I being exposed?

We moved into this house in May 2022. The ice machine came with it.

From day one, I had a weird feeling about it. I asked my husband to clean it constantly. Every two months, we wiped what we could. But there‚Äôs a section that you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot supposed‚Äù to open or clean.

I asked him to open it anyway. What we found inside? MOLD

We tested the ice machine 4 times. Everytime it  came back positive for Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Ochratoxin A. This ice machine that should be sterile and no mold should ever be present.

I also tested my house 3 separate times. All results cameback negative.

The ice machine was the only source. My only exposure.

I stopped using the ice on May 7, 2025. And within 24 hours, my symptoms began to disappear:

* The crippling heartburn was gone
* The salivation so extreme it made me vomit‚Äîgone
* The anxiety, heart palpitations, brain fog‚Äîgone
* The flank pain I had felt for a year and a half‚Äîgone

My body had been screaming at me. And now it was healing.

iI'm still not out of the woods as my body still has high levels of ochratoxin. I‚Äôm still detoxing‚Äîaggressively. I do:

* Sauna
* Hyperbarics
* Supplements - binders - anti fungals
* Ozone therapy
* Red light
* Fenben + ivermectin
* Fasting
* Walking

  I also reached out to my surgeon‚Äîremeber the 4th top kidney cancer doctor in the country super busy guy. I emailed him my theory. I expected him to think I was crazy not give me the time of the day and tell me to kick rocks. But he didn‚Äôt. 

He believed me enough to ask his pathology department to help. But pathology labs in hospitals only test for live fungi. My tumor had been frozen and stored for a month. Ochratoxin is not a mold‚Äîit‚Äôs the toxin mold leaves behind. It won‚Äôt show up in fungal cultures. They called me and told me this was as far as they could go, they were not allowed to go any further if fungi was not present. I needed a mycotoxin test not a fungi test.

 That was the moment I knew I was onto something big. I‚Äôve tried to test my tumor since, but it‚Äôs nearly impossible. There are almost no labs in the U.S. that test tumors for mycotoxins. I contacted Stanford. They can‚Äôt do it. I contacted the head of kidney oncology at one of Oklahoma‚Äôs top medical schools. His reply? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not intelligent enough to answer your question.‚Äù At first I thought it was a political answer. Now I believe he was being honest. 

I‚Äôve also contacted Dr. Tim Guilford, one of the leading experts in mycotoxins. He reviewed my case and said my theory is well thought out.

But the best part and why I think my case is very important for research is because I have proof: I had a clear MRI in February 2022 I moved into this house May 2022 I had symptoms immediately: panic attacks, brain fog, GI issues, heartburn, esophagitis, memory loss. I had a miscarriage (Ochratoxin is associated with placental dysfunction) I had a 1.8cm tumor by October 2024‚Äîway too fast for normal kidney cancer growth (typically 0.3 cm per year).

This was not bad luck. This was exposure. And I believe there are many more people like me. I believe mold is a massive hidden contributor to cancer. Only 5% of cancers are genetic. The rest is very much so enviromental. But no one is testing for it. Doctors aren‚Äôt trained in mold. Mycology isn‚Äôt part of med school. Labs aren‚Äôt offering tumor mycotoxin testing. And yet‚Äîwhen they want to give mice cancer‚Äîthey use the very thing I found in my body ochratoxin to give lab rats kidney cancer. Where‚Äôs the disconnects 

What I want from my experience: 

Health insurance to cover mold illness 

House insurance should pay for mold remediation 

All kidney cancer patients (and others with glioblastoma, sarcoma, basal cell, melanoma, and breast cancer) should be tested for mycotoxins before any treatment plan 

Appliances like ice machines, Keurigs, humidifiers, and fridges need stricter regulation 

Who‚Äôs testing the inner lines we can‚Äôt see? Go on Reddit. Search ‚Äúice machine mold.‚Äù You‚Äôll be shocked. Hospitals, restaurants, schools‚Ä¶  mold is everywhere. And people say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a little mold.‚Äù No. It‚Äôs a little cancer waiting to happen. 

And maybe, just maybe, our obsession with cold is killing us. Cold drinks. Cold homes. Cold air-conditioned cars. Sealed houses. This past summer I went to Italy and they dont really believe in ice and they get mad when americans ask for ice, I wonder if this is why they‚Äôre healthier than us, yes food too but what about our cold obsession. Nobody is talking about this.  

And when we get sick and go to the doctor what do they give us? They give us antibiotic (penicillin) ‚Äîa byproduct of mold a mycotoxin. More mold to a body already drowning in it. 

If I had accepted ‚Äúbad luck,‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt be here. I would probably had a recurrence in two years as I was being exposed to what gave me cancer daily like alot of the people I saw in the groups. I saved my life. I saved my kids‚Äô lives. I saved my husband's life, I saved my family!

Also I have shared my theory on a few cancer groups and some people replied to ""interesting because I had cancer and my husband had cancer within 6 months or I had cancer and my daughter had cancer"" this is no coincindence this is proof of enviromental toxins.  

Please help me share this. More people need to know.  Because cancer isn‚Äôt always bad luck. We are being exposed to whats making us sick and the first and most important thing we should do is to stop exposure than we can think of healing. 

Sometimes I wonder if this cancer was no accident if God gave it to me because he knew I would be crazy and obsessive enough to not accept bad luck as my fate. If my story helps one person I will be happy with that  

Also, If I was diagnosed with cancer today the first thing I would do is a Mycotoxin test

**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my language‚Äîphysical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

1l2oezn,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1l2oezn/my_boyfriend_26m_has_abandoned_and_ghosted_me/,My boyfriend [26M] has abandoned and ghosted me while I [25F] am having an abortion. What do I do?,"I am sharing this anonymously because I really don‚Äôt know what to make of the situation and I am utterly shocked. I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 months and I found out that I was pregnant last week with his child. Some backstory: We started dating because we met through mutual friends two years ago and out of the blue he asked me to go on a date. I really wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship and I also was exploring my sexuality with women, but the date was super fun and we kept hanging out. He asked me to be his girlfriend a few weeks later and I said yes. Two weeks after we started dating, I got laid off from my job. It was a huge shock because I had been there for 3 years and was performing well. I took the lay off in stride and got another (better) offer¬† less than 2 months later. During my unemployment, I had a few rough days, but overall I was motivated and we had a lot of fun together still. He even would tell me ‚ÄúYou have been so fun during your unemployment, you‚Äôve taken it really well‚Äù. About a month ago, after I got the job offer, I decided to start taking the weight loss injections called tirzepitide. I just wanted to lose about 20 pounds and I was struggling with emotionally eating because of my layoff. I wanted a little boost to jumpstart getting back into shape. The first week on tirzepatide went really well, I felt AMAZING and I was being super active. Week 2 was alright. I lost my hunger, but I still felt good. That week my boyfriend brought me on a dinner date and after the date he told me that ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been being snappy ever since you started tirzepatide‚Äù. I asked him for an example and he couldn‚Äôt really give me any besides some moments that I was sassy lol. He wanted to keep arguing so I told him I agreed to disagree and moved on. Week 3 was a disaster‚Ä¶ I started feeling extremely nauseous and fatigued. I was so nauseous that I barely could eat. EVERY smell made me feel nauseous. I couldn‚Äôt drink coffee (my fav drink) anymore or even smell chicken without gagging. I was so exhausted I worked from my bed for two weeks (I‚Äôm a remote worker). I napped in between meetings and did absolutely nothing after work. No working out, no walks with my dogs, no plans with friends. I was so sick that I had no interest in doing anything besides lay in my bed. I felt horrible!¬† I thought it was just side effects from the tirzepatide and tried to push through. I got my doctor to prescribe me zofran because my boyfriend and I planned a weekend beach trip for our 3 month anniversary. I was feeling better on the zofran, but still felt off. Our trip was fun. It was super relaxing and I slept in late everyday. We agreed on the way home from the trip that we should plan another one because we had such a great time. The Tuesday after our trip, I still felt off.¬† I decided to take a pregnancy test and it was positive. I took 7. And they were all positive. My boyfriend and I had already talked about if I did get pregnant, we both wanted an abortion. I called him immediately that morning and told him. All he could say was ‚Äúdamn‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre pregnant‚Äù. Nothing caring or reassuring. Meanwhile, I am crying because I‚Äôm worried about what that means for me and my body. I‚Äôve never been pregnant before, so I was super concerned. He told me he‚Äôd come over after work and order dinner. He came over and pulled a chair up next to my bed to sit in like I was some sort of hospital patient. He rolled a joint and smoked weed and played on his phone. He usually lays in my bed with me. He was in a weird mood and was bickering with me about nothing important. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to bicker anymore and he called me stupid. I asked him if he was still going to order food and he said he already did. He didn‚Äôt even ask me what I wanted. He ordered something I didn‚Äôt like and I told him I didn‚Äôt want it. He ordered the pizza I wanted after but he sent it to his own house so it never came. I dozed off sleeping and when his pizza came he grabbed it and told me he was going to leave. The next day (Wednesday), I texted him in the morning that I was upset about the day before and I wish he would‚Äôve showed more care for me like maybe bringing flowers or snacks over and making sure dinner was right. He agreed and said he‚Äôd do better. Later that day he showed up to my house unannounced with flowers and a picture frame with our picture in it. We hung out for 30 minutes and then said he was leaving to hang out with his friends because he canceled his plans to hang out with me yesterday (the day I found out I was pregnant). I went to bed alone. Thursday I was again battling fatigue, nausea, and my emotions all while working. He texted me and I forgot to respond, but I was really not able to look at my phone much. Friday I called him during lunch to talk and everything seemed fine. I was planning on taking the first pill that afternoon. I texted him when I took it at 1pm and he said he was going to come by after work. He showed up at 3pm unannounced at my house (he gets off work around 5pm). I opened the door and he said we need to talk. He seemed angry. He walked into my house and asked me what was going on between us. I said nothing I‚Äôm literally mid abortion lol. He said my location was off the night before and I‚Äôm a liar. I said that maybe my phone died during the night because I wasn‚Äôt really on it and I‚Äôve been so tired and sleeping alot. He said I‚Äôve been lying about so many things and that just because I‚Äôm having an abortion I have no right to be a bitch. He proceeded to tell me that I‚Äôve been ‚Äúgoing through stuff since we‚Äôve been dating: lay off, tirzepatide and pregnancy and that he‚Äôs gone through nothing and it‚Äôs not fair‚Äù. I was pretty taken aback by this because I thought I was doing a good job of not taking things out on others; I go to therapy every week and try to better myself (he does not). He said I‚Äôm a liar over and over and that I‚Äôm so wrong for telling him he‚Äôs not empathetic and compassionate right now. I stopped him and asked what he wanted out of this conversation and what he came over to my house for. He had no answer. He continued on about how it‚Äôs so depressing how I‚Äôm laying in bed watching movies and playing spider solitaire on my laptop. Like wtf does he think I should do rn? He kept roasting me and I told him to leave my house. I slammed the door behind him. The next day, Saturday I took the rest of the abortion pills and experienced the worst pain of my life. Alone. Laying on the floor of my bathroom. My boyfriend has not contacted me since he came over Friday. Now it is Tuesday and he has still not reached out. At all. He has no idea if I had complications, if I‚Äôm ok, or if I‚Äôm unlive on my bathroom floor. I didn‚Äôt reach out to him, but truthfully I was dealing with so much I decided to focus on myself. I‚Äôm in disbelief that he has abandoned me. Our whole relationship up until this point seemed fine. We talked everyday.¬† He told me he loved me. I have no idea how to move on. I can‚Äôt believe someone would be so heartless. I feel so discarded. Should I call him? Should I not say anything? And lastly‚Ä¶ did I deserve to be ghosted? I‚Äôm so confused.

1l2oelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/kidneycancer/comments/1l2oelt/my_ice_machine_gave_me_kidney_cancer_mold_was_the/,My ice machine gave me kidney cancer - Mold was the root cause for my ccRCC,"I want to share something with you that I believe is not just important‚Äîit‚Äôs urgent. It could save your life. It saved mine.

This is a story about what happens when you refuse to accept ""bad luck"" as an answer. When you dig deeper. When you follow your God-given instinct until you find the truth. Even if no one believes you. Even if it means turning your world upside down.

In November 2023, I began experiencing a strange, dull pain in my flank. It was constant‚Äî24/7. It never stopped. I saw 8 or 9 different doctors. All of them dismissed me. Gas. Muscle pain. Stress. They told me I was too young for cancer. They didn‚Äôt take me seriously. I told them something felt wrong‚ÄîI even said the word ‚Äúcancer‚Äù‚Äîand they brushed me off.
Eventually, one doctor referred me to a GI specialist. I told her everything‚Äîabout my persistent heartburn, my esophagitis (Grade C), and that nagging flank pain. She ordered a CT scan. I didn‚Äôt even get a call. I saw the result on MyChart: ""Kidney mass.""

I went numb. Then I went to Google. And I cried for weeks.

Then I went to church. I begged God for answers, for guidance, for truth. I saw five urologists. Two said monitor it. Three said surgery. I chose to try healing naturally for six months. Looking back, I now believe I could have healed‚Äîif I hadn‚Äôt still been actively exposed to the very thing that was making me sick.

In October 2024, I was diagnosed with a renal mass. On April 14, 2025, I had surgery. With kidney cancer, they usually don‚Äôt biopsy‚Äîit‚Äôs too risky. You don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs cancer until it‚Äôs removed. Chemo and radiation don‚Äôt work well on kidney cancer. Surgery is the treatment.

My pathology report: Stage 1, Grade 2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

I was 36. No family history. I don‚Äôt smoke. I don‚Äôt drink. I did full genetic testing for kidney cancer‚Äîit came back completely negative.
When I asked my surgeon what caused it, he said, ‚ÄúJust bad luck.‚Äù

But something about that phrase struck me like lightning. It felt wrong. I don‚Äôt believe in bad luck‚ÄîI believe in divine guidance. In protection. In purpose. There‚Äôs a saying in Portuguese: ""Quem me cuida n√£o dorme""‚Äîhe who watches over me never sleeps.
So I went home and decided: I was going to find the cause. I owed it to my children. I owed it to myself. If I could find the root cause, I could stop it from coming back.

I joined kidney cancer support groups. And what I found shocked me. So many people with Stage 1 kidney cancer had recurrence‚Äî3, 5, 10, 15 years later. How could we be ""cured"" and still be dying?

Ever just want to chill with someone who gets your vibe ‚Äî no pressure, no expectations, just good company and good energy?

Can laugh at weird jokes and dish some back

Each morning, I step outside, coffee in hand, to greet the day with anticipation. It's a simple ritual, yet within that tranquillity, I've uncovered an unexpected insight:

There's beauty in allowing both sunshine and shade to nurture my inner garden.

I've always been the type to chase the sun, seeking joy in the bright and the vibrant, forgetting that the shade harbors its own gentle lessons. It's where seeds quietly gather strength before breaking through the soil, where roots can extend their reach further than I had imagined.

In moments of reflection, I've realized growth often happens in the shadows. It's not until then that the colors ripple into a magnificent bloom. The balance of light and dark teaches me to embrace all parts of my journey‚Äîthe times of confusion and clarity, the laughter and the solitary walks.

I've come to acknowledge each experience as a gardener would a varied bloom‚Äîsome are bold and demand attention, others are subtle, whispering softly to the soul. And honestly, even amidst the occasional wilt, there's always a promise of renewal.

Cape Giradeau has such an interesting history behind it, which makes complete sense since it's on the Mississippi. I just never connected the dots! Plus, I love Gone Girl and geeked out when I realized it was filmed there. Wish I'd done the filming tour! Anyone got fun stories from when it was happening??

But I really want to shout out the small towns! We stayed overnight in Marble Hill,  teeny town in Bollinger County that's on the MO antique trail (which is noteworthy in and of itself. Found so many things that are HARD to get these days including original stanley cups, the Aladin thermos kind). Let me tell you, it is such a sweet town. If you are in the area, go to EC Reed's! They have an as close to authentic soda counter as you can get all made from scratch, all local as they can find. The pie and ice cream are still running around my mind as did the strawberry pie. And we killed time learning about the sweet little downtown with its old mineral well and library that has actual dinosaur bones in it. Yes, Marble Hill is apparently the Dino fossil capital of MO. The bbq isn't bad either btws. Next time, I'm stopping off in Piedmont for more than a coffee and pie cause I want to explore the UFO capital of MO! Hgwy 34 was full of surprises!!

As you may have guessed, I'm a food tourist, and although St Louis is probably the best for options, the rest of the state is pretty cool! Kansas City bbq is on my list, but this trip, I got to scratch off Leong's special cashew chicken! It was delicious AND right by a giant fork!

I‚Äôve only used pressurized baskets so far, but I‚Äôm ready to switch to non-pressurized and start dialing in real espresso. I have a good background in filter coffee, and I understand the theory behind espresso extraction, even though I‚Äôm just getting started with hands-on experience.

I‚Äôm also curious about temperature surfing with the Gaggia. How tricky is it to manage in daily use? And how hard is it to dial in and maintain consistent results once the machine is set up properly?

Any advice or experiences would be really helpful. Thanks in advance!

The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter mentioned I‚Äôd hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP said it would probably be closer to 2 weeks ‚Äî so I figured I‚Äôd just wait it out.

Then, the very next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the same VP again, this time for an informal coffee chat. The recruiter explained that the first interview was ‚Äúonly an hour,‚Äù and the VP didn‚Äôt get to ask everything she wanted to.

The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the tone was much more casual. She asked a lot about my personal background and interests ‚Äî not much technical or role-specific stuff this time. She mentioned she had two more candidates to meet by the end of that week (the coffee chat was two weeks ago exactly by tomorrow). Before we parted ways, she reminded me that I had her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

I sent her a thank you email that same day but haven‚Äôt heard back yet. A couple of days ago, I noticed the job posting has been taken down. I‚Äôm trying not to overthink, but I‚Äôve only been in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first move outside of retail banking ‚Äî so I‚Äôm feeling a bit anxious.

My mom took a massive heart attack about a week ago. She's 70

She went to the hospital after puking etc didn't know why & they told her. She had 3 blockages... %100 blockage & the other two were 75% & 50% they flew her to another hospital & did surgery, put a Stent in & miraculously is still alive. We were all a wreck.

She has never really eaten healthy although she isn't massively overweight or anything but just never are a piece of fruit or veggies. Cigarettes, coffee, sweets, deep fried food, pizza etc

We are very worried she won't change... the first thing she did when she woke up from surgery is drink soda... the first meal she had was a poutine. Then again today with the poutine. She's very stubborn but I don't wanna lose my momüò® I can't do it.

Alcohol harms the gut barrier allowing inflammatory factors to constantly trigger cortisol.   But there is help from your gut biome!   

Ever wondered why your belly stays despite your best efforts at diet and exercise? In the compelling Substack series by Dr. Garth Slysz, MD, and Joshua Slysz, PhD, the story of Michael, a 45-year-old battling a stubborn ‚Äúbeer gut,‚Äù unravels the surprising truth: it‚Äôs not just about calories. The first post, ‚ÄúThe Beer Gut,‚Äù reveals how regular alcohol consumption punches holes in your gut barrier, flooding your system with inflammation and locking your metabolism in fat-storage mode. Through vivid analogies like a damaged coffee filter and cutting-edge research from Nature, the authors show how alcohol‚Äôs assault on your gut microbiome sabotages weight loss, even for the disciplined. This isn‚Äôt just a story of struggle‚Äîit‚Äôs a science-backed wake-up call that redefines weight gain as a biological battle, not a failure of willpower.
The second installment, ‚ÄúThe Microbiome Connection,‚Äù dives deeper, exploring why GLP-1 medications like Ozempic work miracles for some but fall short for others, like Michael, who hit a frustrating plateau despite his efforts. The authors uncover how your gut microbiome‚Äîthe trillions of bacteria shaping your health‚Äîcontrols both the production and effectiveness of GLP-1, the body‚Äôs metabolic ‚Äúkey‚Äù that regulates hunger, insulin, and fat storage. With insights from 2024 Nature studies, they reveal how specific bacteria, like Desulfovibrio, can poison this system, while others, like Akkermansia, supercharge it. This post transforms complex science into a clear narrative, showing how your gut‚Äôs ecosystem dictates your response to weight loss drugs and why quick fixes alone can‚Äôt break the cycle of metabolic resistance.
What‚Äôs next? The upcoming third post, ‚ÄúThe Triangle of Resistance,‚Äù promises to tie it all together, offering practical strategies to rebuild your gut, tame inflammation, and reset your metabolism‚Äîwith or without medications. This series isn‚Äôt just about understanding weight struggles; it‚Äôs about empowering you to collaborate with your body‚Äôs biology for lasting change. Whether you‚Äôre grappling with a stubborn gut, curious about GLP-1 drugs, or seeking natural ways to boost your metabolism, Dr. Slysz and Dr. Slysz provide a roadmap grounded in science and empathy. Subscribe to their Substack to follow Michael‚Äôs journey and unlock actionable insights for your own health transformation.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what‚Äôs called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what‚Äôs called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

So, unboxing this thing was surprisingly therapeutic. After weeks of being peed on, pooped on, and cried on, I finally had control over something in my life, assembling baby furniture! 

The instructions were actually pretty easy to follow, and I put it together without calling my more mechanically-inclined friend.

First thing I noticed was how much sturdier it felt than those flimsy bassinets that look like they'd collapse if your cat looked at them wrong. It has this substantial feel without being a big bulky thing that takes over your entire bedroom. 

The aesthetics are non-offensive too. I was expecting another piece of baby equipment that screamed ""A CHILD LIVES HERE"" with cartoon animals or primary colors that clash with literally everything in the room Instead, it has this clean, minimalist vibe that doesn't make my bedroom look like it's been invaded by Toys R Us (RIP).

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the AirClub Bassinet Bedside Sleeper here:**

[**https://amzn.to/4juS05J**](https://amzn.to/4juS05J)

# Best features imo

**Auto-lock wheels.** The wheels on this thing deserve their own Instagram account. Unlike other baby products with those flimsy wheel locks that you inevitably forget to engage, these auto-lock wheels are practically idiot-proof. When all four legs are on the ground, the wheels retract like shy turtles, gripping the floor nicelyTo move it, you just lift one side.

**The side that goes down.** Pre-bassinet, nighttime feedings involved a complex choreography of getting out of bed without waking my husband, stumbling to the crib, bringing baby back to bed, feeding, burping, diaper changing, and then returning baby to crib, all while trying not to fully wake up. With the AirClub's zippered side, I can now just reach over, grab baby, feed, and return to their sleep space without ever fully leaving my bed. I've saved approximately 847 miles of nighttime walking in just two months. The zipper is pretty quiet too.

**Height adjustability.** The four height settings actually correspond to real-world bed heights, not some baby furniture designer's fantasy world. Our bed is awkwardly tall (thanks, fancy mattress we bought pre-baby when we still had disposable income), but the AirClub adjusts perfectly to align with it.

**Breathable mesh sides.** as a first-time mom, I spent the first weeks of my baby's life obsessively checking if they were still breathing approximately every 37 seconds. The mesh sides of this bassinet have been good for my anxiety. I can literally see my baby breathing from any angle in the room, which means I can occasionally do wild things like ""watch TV"" or ""eat dinner"" while still performing my breathing checks.

**Comfortable mattress.** My baby, who previously treated sleep like an optional activity they might consider participating in someday, actually sleeps for decent stretches in this thing. The mattress has these little ""snuggle dots"" that are meant to mimic a mother's touch, which sounds like marketing nonsense, but my baby seems to approve.

# Pros

The most immediate benefit is the sheer convenience of having baby right next to you without actually sharing your bed (which sounds nice until you wake up with tiny baby fingers up your nostril). The bedside sleeper configuration has been a lifesaver for night feedings ‚Äì I can literally grab baby, feed them, and put them back without fully waking up. I've mastered the art of zombie-nursing to the point where I sometimes wake up in the morning wondering if those middle-of-the-night feeds actually happened or if I dreamed them.

**the mobility factor is awesome too.** Being able to wheel this thing around means baby can nap in whatever room I'm in, which has allowed me to reclaim parts of my life like ""showering"" and ""eating food that requires two hands."" It‚Äôs become like a stylish baby containment unit that follows me around the house.

**assembly was so straightforward.** There were no mysterious extra pieces, no confusing diagrams, and no need for special tools. Just clear instructions and parts that actually fit together as intended. After the trauma of assembling a crib that nearly ended my marriage, this was refreshingly simple.

**the design is actually... attractive?** Unlike most baby gear that screams PRIMARY COLORS AND CARTOON ANIMALS HAVE INVADED YOUR HOME, this bassinet has a pleasant modern aesthetic that doesn't make my bedroom look like a daycare center. I didn't realize how much I valued this until visitors started commenting on how nice it looked. The neutral color scheme means it blends with our decor instead of fighting it. My inner design snob (who I thought had died during pregnancy) was quietly pleased.

**durability has been impressive too.** Two months in, and there's no sagging, wobbling, or concerning creaks when I place baby inside. The fabric has withstood multiple washings after various bodily fluid incidents without pilling or fading.

# Cons

the price tag definitely made me wince initially. I could have probably bought 47 large coffees for the same price, which, in my sleep-deprived state, seemed like a more worthwhile investment at first. 

# Final Verdict

I can confidently say it's earned its place in our bedroom, and that's high praise from someone who resents most baby equipment for its invasion of adult space.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs great for parents who value their sleep but also want to keep baby close. Also good in homes where space is at a premium, if you need to move baby around throughout the day, or for anyone who‚Äôs recovering from C-sections or difficult deliveries (that easy access is a back/abdominal muscle saver).

Who should avoid it? If you're blessed with a massive bedroom where distance isn't an issue, you might not appreciate the bedside features as much. And if you're looking for something that will last until college, this isn't it, your baby will outgrow it eventually.

I‚Äôd buy it again in a heartbeat, and I've already added it to my must-have list for friends who announce pregnancies. Because nothing says ""congratulations on your impending sleep deprivation"" like the gift of a good bassinet.

I filled the water reservoir cup, inserted the capsule (stated for 7.7 oz) and turned it on.

The way I understood the directions, the machine determines how much water to brew based on the type of capsule used...but something seems off on my first go around.

I used a 10 ounce mug....the water kept coming and I kept watching and I became concerned when I noticed it started running thin and watery and filled the top of the mug....ugh

and...not a surprise...the coffee tasted watery.

I guess I can cut the machine off next time before I get to that point, but maybe I don't understand the way the machine is supposed to operate? anyone? thanks",1,1748985954.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

1l2nubx,https://www.reddit.com/r/emptynesters/comments/1l2nubx/how_to_navigate_young_adult_child_living_with_you/,How to navigate young adult child living with you?,"Just looking for some good tips, guidance on how to handle having a young adult child (AC) moving back in with you. One of my kids just graduated from college. Husband and I have offered to let them stay with us for a temporary period of time in order to work and save.  We will charge them $1500 a month for rent/utilities.  We will give this back to AC when they move out for first month rent, security deposit, financial cushion etc. AC is generally a responsible person, but also I do notice some areas of immaturity as they head into the adult world.

AC received graduation money last month, and they chose to stay at their friend's parent's beach house versus getting to my place to start working. They went to the beach house for a week at spring break and then for a week after graduation. That's fine. I'm glad they had that week of fun at the beach to celebrate graduating. However, the stay at the beach house has now extended to three weeks. They want to stay two more weeks because other friends are arriving soon.

AC had plenty of trips, fun, parties in college and is graduating debt free. AC is quickly running out of money blowing through their savings from part time work and their graduation money. AC spends too much on eating out, frivolous things and does not have a good handle on how expensive adult life is. It's like they do not have a sense of urgency to save that graduation money as a cushion or to spend on necessities. AC asked me if I could help them out with some new things for the apartment. I'm like, hello, that is what your graduation money should be used for not loafing around partying with friends. They seem to be wanting to cling to college fun/party life by staying with the friends right now. They said they are struggling with the idea of leaving to start their own adult life apart from friends.

We have made it clear that we are not supporting AC past college. They do have an entry level job lined up that starts in August. If I had been AC, I would have gone to the beach house for a week, but then gone to my parents' house to begin working a summer temp job. AC could have lined up a summer temp job but did not.  We found several summer jobs for them near our house and they did not pursue it.

My AC can be challenging to deal with, at times.  For example, I could see them going broke, and then arguing with me that I should help them out since they just graduated. They may try to take the angle that they should be cut slack just getting out of school, and need some time to transition to being an adult.

Also, AC has some friends who I could see wanting to come stay. We live in a nice city in an area with a lot to do. I'm okay with an occasional visitor for a few days at a time. I do not want these friends staying in the small apartment suite for days, weeks on end. The friends don't have any career paths as of now and partied through college. I'm sensing some Peter Pan Syndrome vibes with some of them. We also don't want romantic interests staying overnight in the apartment. It is mainly just for AC to use for the time being.

Just curious how others have handled this situation of allowing an AC back into the house. I'm wondering if I should draft up a lease. Also, AC will likely be eating dinner with us many nights. I wonder if I should require AC to contribute per month to food ie $150/month. Also, this may sound silly but AC eats out very often. They go out for coffee every day versus brewing it at home. Husband and I don't really eat out often because it is very expensive in our city. Of course, I will occasionally treat AC to a meal out once or twice a month. I just don't want them constantly asking me if I want to go grab a bite, coffee, drinks, meals out and then expecting me to pick up the tab. I can kind of see something like this happening.

Any ideas greatly appreciated to avoid pitfalls, miscommunication, conflicts, etc.  I know I need to establish and stick by boundaries if they move into our apartment. I also know that when I hand them over the savings from rent that I cannot control how they spend it. Once they move out by December (later if we all agree it is working ok and AC wants to stay longer), it is now fully on them to be financially responsible and wise. My other AC is definitely more mature, and I would not have to worry much at all about setting up boundaries and safeguards with them.

I feel completely stuck and hopeless in a toxic relationship. I want to leave, but I‚Äôm financially and emotionally trapped. I‚Äôm looking for advice from anyone who‚Äôs been through something like this‚Äîhow did you find the courage to leave and start over?

Context:
I‚Äôm 34F, he‚Äôs 34M. We‚Äôve been together for 9 years, and most of that time has been filled with lies, manipulation, and cheating. He was my trainer at work when we first met. He told me to keep it a secret because of work policies, but he was already hiding things. He deleted messages to other women and even suggested dating someone else to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù us from management. I knew it was messed up, but I didn‚Äôt leave.

Over the years, I caught him cheating multiple times: Tinder, coffee dates, and even with a sex worker. He would always gaslight me, blame me, and say he wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong. He love-bombs me, says he‚Äôs not a bad person, but it‚Äôs always just manipulation.

During the pandemic, we moved into my dad‚Äôs condo. I asked him to leave because we were always fighting, but he refused‚Äîsaid he had nowhere else to go. I was the one paying for everything, so I felt stuck. Later, we moved out and rented our own place, but it didn‚Äôt get any better. I even paid for his lasik surgery and bought him everything he wanted, hoping it would help us. It didn‚Äôt.

Now we have a condo under a rent-to-own scheme‚ÄîI paid the downpayment, and he‚Äôs paying the monthly. He‚Äôs also racked up about 200k in debt on my credit cards. I know he won‚Äôt pay it back if I leave, so I feel financially chained to him. I‚Äôm so exhausted and angry, and I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt happy. Some days I even think about ending it all because it feels like there‚Äôs no way out.

Previous Attempts:
I‚Äôve tried asking him to leave, but he won‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried to make the relationship work, thinking maybe if I gave more, it would get better. But it never did‚Äîhe just kept lying and cheating. I‚Äôve stopped sleeping in the same bed as him because I can‚Äôt stand being close to him anymore. I‚Äôve thought about leaving so many times, but I‚Äôm terrified about the debt and starting over on my own.

What I‚Äôm Asking:
If you‚Äôve been in a situation like this, how did you find the strength to leave? How did you manage the debt and everything else that felt like it was tying you down? Any advice or just hearing your story would mean a lot to me. Can I file a case under VAWC just for him to pay me back?

My husband wanted a coffee so I got him one and myself and I went to Target to get little one items and items for him too. I got home and I guess he had it fought with LO (he was watching her the whole day while I worked from home and he‚Äôs off work for summer.)  So I get home and I guess he was trying to put LO down and he was gonna work out with some weights at home. I was excited to show him what I got to surprise him, so I said ‚Äúcome look and see what I got!‚Äù I was happy smiling ear to ear. 
His reply was, ‚ÄúI hate being at home!‚Äù Home to me is wife and baby. I looked at him and said ‚Äúwhy are you saying that?‚Äù He goes because I can never do what I want to do. 

I guess want is for him to work out and I interrupted that to show him what I got. It wasn‚Äôt like he was working out and here I come interpreting. He was walking around. 

So I said you‚Äôre being sassy. I said this to be nice bc I wanted to say some other colorful chose words. When I said sassy I didn‚Äôt even say it mean. I should‚Äôve took more offense to him saying I don‚Äôt want to be home.

So of course he got mad because I said sassy and I ‚Äúwas challenging his manhood‚Äù. I said sassy before to him. I guess I should‚Äôve said attitude or rude. I didn‚Äôt even mean it like that.

I just rolled my eyes and walked away. We haven‚Äôt really talked, he apologize but not really. Walking around acting sad but then still being snappy with me. 

I‚Äôm over it. I‚Äôm postpartum and I have to deal with his emotions when he could talk to me.

Last night he asked me what‚Äôs wrong. üòë he‚Äôs acting all sad. Not even talking to me.  I said nicely I don‚Äôt appreciate you saying I hate being home and he had no reply. 

I don‚Äôt know what to say or how to move forward. Bc he is always like this. I told him to talk to a therapist bc yelling and reacting to something so small makes no sense and it causes me stress and for me to cry.

I used to take little pulls out of the bottle of vodka  in the cabinet above their coffee maker. My dad has his one cocktail every night and the bottle is always there. Always. Forever there in my memory. 

For years I took those little sips. Usually in addition to what I was publicly drinking. I was sneaky about it. Christmas, birthdays, etc. or if I was staying over, just a way to get another pull whenever I was in the kitchen. Thousands of little pulls over the years. Think you get it. 

So the other day i opened that cabinet to get sweetener for my tea and instinctively reached out my hand and touched the bottle. Like it was a motion memory that is imprinted on me. Zero desire to drink. Zero increased temptation once my hand felt the glass bottle. Didn‚Äôt even pick the bottle up! I honestly do not want to tell my real world people about it.

1l2nfqg,https://i.redd.it/7eg6h3cu1s4f1.jpeg,How the conflict between Tolstoy and Turgenev nearly ended in a duel,"Conflicts between writers weren‚Äôt rare, especially among such proud and sharp-souled men as Tolstoy and Turgenev. Sometimes a careless comment could spark a fight that almost ended in a duel. That almost happened on May 27 (June 8), 1861, when these two Russian literary legends had a heated clash that nearly turned violent.

They weren‚Äôt strangers by then. Their first meeting happened in 1855, when Tolstoy, just back from the Crimean War, rushed to see Turgenev. He wrote to his sister that same evening about how he and Turgenev had embraced, dined at Nekrasov‚Äôs, played chess. He even moved into Turgenev‚Äôs house for over a month. They talked, read, introduced each other to friends, admired one another‚Äôs work.

They had at least heard of each other before meeting in person. The future classic *Childhood* was first read by Nekrasov in 1852. He praised it and recommended the book to Turgenev. Some time later, Turgenev replied to Nikolai Alekseevich:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, this talent is promising‚Ä¶ Write to him and encourage him to keep writing. Tell him (if it would interest him) that I greet him, bow to him, and applaud him.‚Äù

Turgenev was also interested in Tolstoy‚Äôs next story, *Boyhood*. He was genuinely pleased for Tolstoy and this time called his talent ‚Äúfirst-rate.‚Äù Ivan Sergeyevich sent Lev Nikolaevich a letter in which he assured him of his high regard and said he expected great things from him.

Tolstoy was flattered by the praise from the older, more well-known writer and dedicated his story *The Cutting of the Forest* to him. A bit earlier, he had written in his diary: ‚ÄúRead A Sportsman‚Äôs Sketches by Turgenev, and somehow it‚Äôs hard to write after him.‚Äù

It seemed their relationship was becoming idyllic. The friendship of two great talents was growing stronger. But no, things weren‚Äôt that smooth. On February 7, 1856, Tolstoy wrote in his diary: ‚ÄúQuarreled with Turgenev.‚Äù Twelve days later came a new entry: ‚ÄúDined at Turgenev‚Äôs, we‚Äôve made up again.‚Äù A little over a month later, he noted once more: ‚ÄúIt seems I‚Äôve parted ways with Turgenev for good.‚Äù

Still, they kept meeting, both abroad and in Russia, talking, writing letters, mentioning each other in correspondence with friends and family. But tensions simmered. On July 5, 1856, Tolstoy again expressed his irritation:

‚ÄúTurgenev arrived. He‚Äôs completely unreasonable, cold, and heavy. I pity him. I‚Äôll never agree with him.‚Äù

Turgenev fired back just as sharply:

‚ÄúNot a single word, not a single movement in Tolstoy is natural. He‚Äôs always posing. And I can‚Äôt explain, in an intelligent man, this vanity of his worn-out countship‚Ä¶ Boil a Russian officer in tar for three days - you still won‚Äôt get the junker arrogance out of him. Varnish that kind of person however you want, and the beast still shows through.‚Äù

They clashed, then made up, then clashed again. Afanasy Fet recalled being ‚Äúa witness to the despair Turgenev fell into, boiling and suffocating from argument, while Tolstoy stayed outwardly restrained, yet all the more cutting.‚Äù

Sometimes the quarrels broke out in front of others. Once, at Nekrasov‚Äôs, Turgenev spoke so long and with such passion that he grabbed his throat and whispered, choking:

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go on! I have bronchitis!‚Äù

He began pacing anxiously. Tolstoy muttered,

‚ÄúBronchitis is an imaginary illness.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the host worried that these two pillars of *Sovremennik* were falling apart over nothing.

Then the anger would fade. They‚Äôd realize they couldn‚Äôt do without each other. Until, of course, the next blow-up.

In spring 1861, both returned from abroad and shared a carriage to visit Fet‚Äôs estate in Stepanovka, 70 versts from Turgenev‚Äôs Spasskoye. Fet and his wife, Maria Petrovna, welcomed them warmly and gave them rooms in their large, comfortable house.

The first day went peacefully. They walked, talked, had dinner. But the trouble began the next morning, May 27. Fet described it in *My Memoirs*:

‚ÄúAt our usual hour, eight in the morning, the guests entered the dining room. My wife sat at the head of the table by the samovar, and I took my seat at the other end, waiting for coffee. Turgenev sat on her right, Tolstoy on her left. Knowing how much Turgenev cared about his daughter‚Äôs upbringing, my wife asked if he was satisfied with her English governess. Turgenev began praising her, and among other things said the governess, with true English punctuality, had asked him to set the amount his daughter could spend on charitable causes.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù said Turgenev, ‚Äúthe Englishwoman insists my daughter handle poor people‚Äôs worn clothes herself- mend them with her own hands, and then return them as such.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you think that‚Äôs good?‚Äù asked Tolstoy.

‚ÄúOf course. It brings the benefactor closer to real need.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I think a dolled-up girl with filthy rags on her knees is just playing an insincere, theatrical scene.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ask you not to say that!‚Äù Turgenev burst out, his nostrils flaring.

‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt I say what I believe?‚Äù Tolstoy replied.

I didn‚Äôt have time to shout to Turgenev, ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù when, pale with rage, he snapped: ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll make you be silent with an insult.‚Äù

With that, he jumped up, clutched his head, and stormed out into the next room. A moment later, he came back and said to my wife:

‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake, forgive my disgraceful behavior. I deeply regret it.‚Äù

Then he left again.

Soon after, both furious writers left Fet‚Äôs house.

Now, on the surface, it seems like a trivial flare-up. A heated moment, a disagreement. It should‚Äôve ended with handshakes and forgiveness. But no. That small spark grew into a fire neither of them put out.

One has to understand the customs and pride of that era. You couldn‚Äôt say something in public without accepting the consequences. Many gentlemen, especially writers, were not only touchy, but prone to illusions. They caught offense where there was none, allusions where none were intended. So it was with these two: the fiercely proud, volatile Tolstoy and the occasionally aloof, sarcastic Turgenev, in whose hearts mutual dislike flickered on and off for years.

There may have been a deeper reason behind the quarrel. Perhaps  Lev Nikolaevich felt sympathy for Turgenev‚Äôs only daughter, Pelageya, born out of wedlock, and was upset by what he saw as a performance rather than genuine care. Or maybe he simply sensed some falseness in Turgenev‚Äôs words. Still, it seems absurd that such a dispute should go as far as a challenge to a duel. Especially when, back then, a duel could just as easily turn into a fistfight between two stubborn men.

Years later, in 1877, Tolstoy‚Äôs wife Sofia Andreevna recalled, apparently from his own telling, the scene:

‚ÄúTurgenev said, ‚ÄòSo you think I‚Äôm raising my daughter badly?‚Äô

Lev Nikolaevich replied that he merely said what he thought, that he hadn‚Äôt attacked him personally, but simply expressed an opinion.

Turgenev got angry and suddenly said, ‚ÄòIf you keep talking like that, I‚Äôll punch you in the face.‚Äô‚Äù

Thankfully, there were no fists, pistols, or rifles. Though things very nearly escalated. At one point, according to Sofia Andreevna, Tolstoy even sent a courier to Turgenev‚Äôs estate in Spasskoye with a formal duel challenge. Then he sent another letter clarifying:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a trivial duel where two writers show up, shoot into the air, and go home to drink champagne. I want a real duel. Let him come to Boguslav - we‚Äôll shoot with rifles.‚Äù

It‚Äôs chilling to imagine how that might have ended for Russian literature and the world. Turgenev was a skilled hunter. Tolstoy, a seasoned military officer.

After that, their relationship broke down for years. Both regretted the quarrel, but neither made a move toward reconciliation.

‚ÄúThere shouldn‚Äôt be misunderstandings between us - we understand each other too well,‚Äù Turgenev wrote to Fet.

‚ÄúBut we also understand that we can‚Äôt be close. We‚Äôre made from different clay.‚Äù

But everything passes. Seventeen years after that scene in Stepanovka, on April 6, 1878, Tolstoy finally wrote to Turgenev:

‚ÄúLately, thinking of my relationship with you, I was surprised and glad to realize I hold no hostility toward you. God grant it‚Äôs the same on your side. To be honest, knowing your kind nature, I‚Äôm nearly certain any hard feelings you had toward me faded long ago‚Ä¶ I remember I owe my literary fame to you. I remember how much you once loved my writing, and me. And perhaps you can recall something similar, because there was a time I sincerely loved you. If you can forgive me, I offer you all the friendship I‚Äôm capable of.‚Äù

Turgenev, moved to tears, replied at once:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs with the greatest joy that I accept the hand you‚Äôve extended. You were right: I never harbored hostility toward you. If there was any, it vanished long ago. All I‚Äôve kept is the memory of someone I sincerely cared for, as a person and a writer, whose first steps I once celebrated before others, and whose every new work stirred my deepest interest.‚Äù

That same year, the writer-hunter visited Tolstoy twice at Yasnaya Polyana. Their old rift seemed at last healed.

When Tolstoy learned Turgenev was gravely ill, he sent a final message:

‚ÄúI realized how much I love you. I felt that if you died before me - it would hurt deeply.‚Äù

The long battle between Ivan Turgenev‚Äôs ‚Äúunimaginably painful illness‚Äù and his ‚Äúunimaginably strong body‚Äù ended in September 1883. Tolstoy would live 27 more years - fruitful, prolific, and no doubt haunted, at times, by what could‚Äôve been had their duel taken place.

1l2nfjl,https://i.redd.it/ytj10vrv0s4f1.jpeg,A strange place for a reunion,"Time to commit to an actual title. Woo! Not sure whether it's cringe or not, but might as well give it a go.

Not too happy with this one, which is why it took a few days to actually figure out and is a little shorter than I would have liked. Different scenario, writer's block, and just not really having it click with me. I think the last paragraph went well, though, but I can't exactly have an objective opinion on my own work. Again, feedback is always appreciated, the more scathing the better, and I've got a few ideas in the works, including potential smut, but if you've got other scenarios I'd love to hear them

Also cool Mosasaurus.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Turns out trying to rush the entire backline by yourself isn‚Äôt a great idea. Lin knew this, but hey, he can respawn, so‚Ä¶ Why not? At least, that‚Äôs what he was telling himself as he desperately ducked into a side room, feeling the bullets whizzing past his head finally stop. He finally let out a sigh, slumping against the wall and holding his side, trying to stem the bleeding until he could muster up the energy to regroup with his team. Still, he was safe here. No-one had‚Äì

‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre having just as much fun as I am.‚Äù

Lin can‚Äôt help but smirk, untying his mask (I don‚Äôt actually know what it‚Äôs called. The weird blindfold he wears.) and arm wraps binding them around his stomach. It soaks red quick, but it‚Äôs the best he can do for now.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one way of putting it. Still, at least I‚Äôve only been shot, not had my leg wrecked.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well I can heal it off. You‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI can.‚Äù

‚Äú... Fuck you.‚Äù

Luna reaches down, slipping off her boots and pressing down hard on her leg with a grunt of pain. Even under the fabric wrapping her legs, Lin can still clearly see that the bone‚Äôs not supposed to be where it is. Washing away bullet scrapes is easy, but fractured limbs? Not so much.¬†

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt going to try to kill me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would I? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to drag myself across the floor to get punched in the face.‚Äù

He chuckles softly, though quickly regrets it as a jolt of pain surges through him. He just had to focus to get his chi in alignment enough to fix his side, but with her here, it was a little more difficult.

‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶ How are you, I guess?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, fine. K-Pop still exists, so there‚Äôs that. You?‚Äù

‚ÄúApart from all of time being ripped apart and one of my oldest friends trying to freeze me to death, not bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take it personally.‚Äù

‚Äú... To be fair, neither of us actually know what‚Äôs going on, do we?‚Äù

Luna sighs, before grimacing again as she presses down on her leg, hearing a sickening crunch. Gesturing with her head, Lin manages to stumble over, leaving a bloody imprint of where he‚Äôd been sat, and collapses down next to her.

‚ÄúMind pushing down on my thigh for me?‚Äù

He does as he‚Äôs told, muscles tensing slightly as he forces it to the floor. He can see the pained expression on the idol‚Äôs face, hear her laboured breaths as she rests her hands over the splintered femur. A soft glow begins to emanate from where her palms rest against her skin, and they both watch as the bone slowly begins to weave itself back together, though the blood everywhere makes it a little tricky to see clearly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm never going to get used to that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I know, it just looks‚Ä¶ Wrong, somehow.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be fair, you are technically a freak of nature. Y‚Äôknow, with the whole reactor thing and all.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really know how to compliment a lady, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

She can‚Äôt hide her little smirk, though, as they both look up, a massive boom shaking the foundations of the room. They‚Äôd almost forgotten there‚Äôs still a fight going on outside, and by the sounds of it, it‚Äôs pretty rough. Still, at least if they‚Äôre both down here, the teams are still equal, so‚Ä¶ Why not take a break?

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ Yeah. I‚Äôve got no real clue why I‚Äôm fighting. Stark said something about vampires and quantum stuff and all sorts of other sciency stuff. Couldn‚Äôt understand a word of it. But I don‚Äôt exactly have anyone else to trust. He and Reed seem to be the only people that actually understand what‚Äôs going on, and I‚Äôd rather actually do something that might help than sit around doing nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt actually know why you‚Äôre doing this? Just that Tin Can told you to?‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty much. I know there are people out there fighting vampires and stopping spider webs from being destroyed, but apparently grabbing some lump of black goo is more important than all that.‚Äù

Lei glances back down at Luna‚Äôs leg, recoiling slightly at the sight of flesh knitting itself back together. Healing‚Äôs always seemed just‚Ä¶ Disgusting to him. At least, in accelerated ways like this. It‚Äôs a bit hypocritical, since he does the same with chi, but still, it just feels creepy.

‚ÄúYou sure about not getting us back together?‚Äù

‚ÄúMost of us are dead, and the only remaining members are either scattered, or checked out of superhero-ism a long time ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill, it‚Äôd be nice to have one last Agents of Atlas meetup before everything goes to hell even more.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Guess you‚Äôre right. It would be nice to actually be part of something I already know.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore timelines are still getting dragged in, it‚Äôs not off the table that we might find more of us.‚Äù

Luna finally seems to have finished healing for the most part, sitting back with a groan. The effort of healing herself‚Äôs clearly taken a lot out of her, more than she‚Äôs used to. She flashes Lin a small smirk, a slight edge of teasing in her voice.

‚ÄúHow long do you reckon we can draw this out before the others notice?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause we haven‚Äôt had a moment like this for a while. Just a chance to talk. Everything‚Äôs always getting in the way, and after Atlas broke up‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôve missed you.‚Äù

Lin hesitates momentarily, seeming a little flustered at her response. He hadn‚Äôt been expecting that in the slightest. Sure, missing Atlas, but‚Ä¶ Him specifically? They‚Äôd worked together a lot closer a few years back, but he hadn‚Äôt realised just how deeply that connection ran until now.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realise you‚Ä¶ You saw us as close.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I did. You were the only fun one there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, uh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve missed you too, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, thanks. Really from the heart, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Luna manages to shakily push herself to her feet, blood still staining her entire leg red while her tattered boot sits on the floor nearby. Lin isn‚Äôt doing much better, the wraps around his wound not doing much and staining his uniform a dark red. They lock eyes, faces a little more hesitant, both thinking the same thing.

‚ÄúReckon you can make it to the edge of the map? I‚Äôm not exactly in good shape to walk.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, we respawn fully fixed up. Faster and probably less painful than staging like this for god knows how long while you bleed out and I enjoy the pain of having shards of bone in my leg.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Could we meet up for a chat sometime? Over coffee, at a park, anything. It‚Äôs been a little lonely, being dragged away from my timeline, and‚Ä¶ It‚Äôd be nice to talk to someone I know for a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôd like that. I‚Äôll call you after I‚Äôve put the kids down tonight, alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. Now hold still‚Äî‚Äú

Luna doesn‚Äôt have time to react as Lin moves, faster than she can blink, and a second later she‚Äôs gone, a fist from her friend finally putting her out of her misery and sending her back to the respawn queue. A hand clamped to his side, he stumbles out of the room, the sounds of battle further away, quieter. It was almost‚Ä¶ Quaint. But maybe he could enjoy it later. Staggering down the steps, the void of nothingness stretched out in front of him, a strange call echoing to his very soul, urging him to give in. And he doesn‚Äôt resist, not anymore. Closing his eyes, he let gravity take him, down and down, falling through blackened clouds as though cradled by the softest arms of nothingness. He could feel the darkness fading in, but it was a peaceful one. Painless. The endless abyss sending him to the arms of a gentle finality. And the last thought lingering in his mind was one of comfort.

I went to my GI today for some issues I‚Äôm having and she did bloodwork as well. Those counts are still elevated. WBC is 13.2 and Neutrophils are 8.32. Glucose was pretty high at 128 but I did have an iced coffee right before I went in so I‚Äôm chalking it up to that for now.

Can I be 100% sure the roast dates are correct? No - but the coffee tasted good (and in the end, that's all that really matters).



I could order full-sized bags instead - but that's not the point of rotation. Rotation is about being able to try so many different coffees that you would've never normally considered trying.

In my opinion, it's better to spend $6-15 on a 50g bag and not like it than $30-100+ on a full sized bag and have buyer's remorse.

You were so traumatized by what happened that you didn't so much just go back in the closet as you hit rewind and pulled yourself back to a state where you never left the closet in the first place.""

""You gonna push me to come out like the rest of them?""

""No. Of course not. That sort of decision is one you should very much have control of yourself.""

Setting aside her notebook, the therapist seemed to relax.

""No one is owed your sexuality in any context, Pete.""

""Maybe tell my publicist and my agent and everyone on the damn internet that.""

""I would, if I thought it could help. Right now, though, I'm telling you. I think you need to have it fully affirmed in your own mind. Your self is your self. You belong to you. Granted, you've gone into a field that means some of your personal business is public, but that doesn't mean you have to let the public really own you.""

With a grunt, Pete hunched forward.

""Can I ask you something?"" he sighed.

""Always.""

""Your wife is famous, right?""

""I mean, she's a well-known athlete.""

""How do **you** deal with being so publicly out? Like, with the press wanting to be all up in your business?""

""Personally? I was lucky, in a way. My wife and I met in college. She was already out, and I was pretty ready to be out myself. We already knew there was a chance she'd make it through the draft and that her career would go places. We talked about it, discussed what that would mean for us. For our future.""

""And, like, it doesn't bother you?""

""Well, it's annoying when the press is so intrusive, but we find ways to keep private the things we need to. Pete, is this... Have you been seeing someone and you're concerned about them? About how they'll react if you're outed?""

Pete shook his head.

""I'm alone, doc. But I guess I do think about it. If I ever met someone, man or woman or whatever, I... I dunno. I'd want that to be private. To me, being in love means belonging to each other, and if everything about me is supposed to belong to everyone...""

""That's not true.""

""I know, I know. But the pressure. I... I dunno.""

""Have you considered a break? Just a little getaway or something?""

""All the time,"" Pete huffed.  
""Can't manage it right now, though. We're filming the new season soon.""

""Have you maybe talked to your people about it? I'm sure something could be arranged.""

""I haven't, but maybe I will. Maybe.""

The rest of the session was quiet. Nice, really. Pete felt genuinely comfortable with Dr. Contreras.

""You never push too hard,"" he commented, and she laughed.

""Tell that to my wife. Hey, is it all right with you if we reschedule next week to Thursday? Life stuff.""

""Sure, no problem. Hope it works out for you.""

""Hmm, I feel like I should be saying that to you,"" Dr. Contreras chuckled as she walked Pete back to reception.

The sun was too bright as Pete stepped out into the day, and he cursed not having brought a hat or shades. He had caught a ride here, and he thought of getting another to head back home, but instead he just started walking. He ended up at a little coffee shop, and he had an iced green tea and an everything bagel with papaya cream cheese to pass the time. A snack always seemed to ease things.

Maybe he should talk to Dr. Contreras about the whole eating his feelings thing.

As he stood and went to throw away his napkin, the door of the place swung open, and a woman ducked in, two small children walking with her. Before the door fully closed, there was the unmistakable murmur and flash of a paparazzi feeding frenzy.

Shit.

Grabbing his cup, Pete took another sip of tea and watched the woman walk toward the counter, then looked to the door. How was he going to get out through the bullshit? Fuck.

*'Well we all gotta go some time,'* he thought.

Squaring his shoulders, Pete sighed and headed for the door. He foot was barely on the pavement outside before he was assailed.

""Hey! Hey Pete! Pete, where you headed? Going to see Kirsten by any chance?""

""Pete, over here! Can we just get a pic...""

""Mr. Coran, you looking forward to shooting the new season of *What I Want*?""

Pulling out his phone, Pete summoned a ride. Luckily, there was a driver less than a block away.

1l2n228,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l2n228/ive_been_blind_since_birth_last_week_i_started/,"I‚Äôve been blind since birth. Last week, I started noticing something watching me.","I know how this is going to sound. I‚Äôm not stupid. I know Reddit isn‚Äôt exactly the best place for a blind person to talk about ‚Äúseeing things.‚Äù That‚Äôs the point. I‚Äôve been blind since birth. Total blindness ‚Äî zero light perception, nothing. My world is touch, sound, smell, memory, and routine. I‚Äôve never ‚Äúseen‚Äù anything, not even in dreams. Not even once.

Until last week.

And now I think I‚Äôm going to die.

I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment on the sixth floor of a pretty standard building in the city. I have a system ‚Äî keys always clipped to my belt, guide stick by the door, phone with voice-over, everything labeled with tactile stickers. I don‚Äôt need help. I walk my block with muscle memory. I know the elevator by the sound of its grind, and I can feel when a neighbor‚Äôs perfume lingers in the hallway.

That‚Äôs how dialed-in I am to my environment.

So when something changes‚Ä¶ I notice.

It started five nights ago. I woke up around 3:00 a.m. with this weird sense ‚Äî not a noise, not a smell, just a presence. Like something was there in the room with me.

I thought maybe my neighbor‚Äôs cat had gotten in again. It‚Äôs happened before ‚Äî little bastard slips through cracked doors. I sat up in bed and called out. ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ anyone there?‚Äù I felt for the edges of my blanket. My hand trembled.

Nothing. Just still air.

Then I felt it. Like a shape in the room. Like how you can feel when someone‚Äôs standing too close behind you, even without hearing them breathe. But worse. It felt wrong. Like its shape didn‚Äôt match anything that should be able to stand upright. Too tall, but narrow. And still. Too still.

I froze. Every hair on my arms stood up. I reached out into the empty air ‚Äî and felt nothing. But in my chest, I could feel it‚Ä¶ watching me.

Not seeing. Watching.

The next morning, I laughed it off. Sleep paralysis, maybe? A dream I didn‚Äôt know I was dreaming? I have a therapist, and I told her. She asked if I was stressed. I said yeah, a little. My job‚Äôs been weird lately, and sometimes the city noise gets under my skin.

But the next night‚Ä¶ it came back.

Same time. 3:00 a.m. Same presence.

I kept my eyes open ‚Äî which sounds weird, I know ‚Äî but when you‚Äôre blind, ‚Äúeyes open‚Äù just means ‚Äúfacing the dark.‚Äù I laid there, breathing slow, trying not to move.

And this time, it moved. It shifted closer.

The air in the room changed, like it dragged something with it. The pressure. The silence. The texture of the nothing around me.

Then I heard it. Not a word. A sound. A click. Soft. Deliberate.

It had joints. And it was cracking them like fingers.

I haven‚Äôt slept since Tuesday. I pretend I‚Äôm not home at night ‚Äî headphones on, lights on (though that‚Äôs for the neighbors, not me). But I know it still comes. I feel it standing just outside the room. Sometimes I hear it dragging its hand across the walls. Sometimes I hear it whispering in a voice that sounds like mine.

Yesterday, I knocked over my coffee mug in the kitchen. When I bent to pick it up‚Ä¶ I swear I felt something cold brush the back of my neck. A finger. Long. Smooth. Curious.

Tonight, it did something new.

It knocked.

Three times. Slow. On the inside of my bedroom closet.

I haven‚Äôt opened that door in a week.

I don‚Äôt know what it wants. But it‚Äôs learning. It‚Äôs figuring out how I move, how I live. How I try to ignore it.

And now I think it knows I can sense it. That I‚Äôm not just a blind person to it anymore. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ something else.

A mirror? A target?

If you‚Äôre reading this, you probably think I‚Äôm crazy. I would too. But something is in my apartment. It wasn‚Äôt there before. And every time it comes back, it gets closer.

I don‚Äôt think I have much time left.

If it touches me again ‚Äî if it climbs into bed like I think it did last night ‚Äî I won‚Äôt survive it.

Please, if anyone‚Äôs heard of something like this‚Ä¶ tell me what it is.

Because I swear I never used to see anything.

And now I can‚Äôt stop sensing it.

Quick note up top: Yes, I‚Äôm still alive. No, I didn‚Äôt sleep. Yes, it came back.
And now I know for sure: it knows I can sense it.
It‚Äôs not pretending anymore.

At 2:58 a.m., Willow ‚Äî my dog ‚Äî started growling at the closet. Not barking. Growling. Real low. She never does that. She pressed into my legs like she wanted me to pick her up, and I could feel her trembling.

And then I felt it again.

Not outside. Not in the hall.

Inside the closet.

It stood up.

The pressure changed. Like the shape of the air shifted. Something tall. Taller than a person. Narrow, jointed. I could feel its form ‚Äî not by touching it, but by how it bent the room around it.

And then came the voice.

It didn‚Äôt speak like a human. It didn‚Äôt even make sound. The voice was inside my thoughts. Echoed with my own tone.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to know I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

It sounded disappointed. Like I ruined a surprise party.

Then it moved ‚Äî up. Onto the ceiling. It didn‚Äôt climb. It just‚Ä¶ changed location.

And it began matching my breathing.

I called my therapist in the morning. Told her I was ‚Äúnoticing things.‚Äù She asked, calm as anything:

‚ÄúHas it started interacting with you directly?‚Äù

I said yes. I asked if she‚Äôd ever heard of this before.

Her answer chilled me more than the voice did.

‚ÄúSome people, especially blind from birth, may perceive things the rest of us can‚Äôt.
If something doesn‚Äôt want to be perceived‚Ä¶ noticing it gives it shape.‚Äù

She told me not to sleep in silence.

‚ÄúIt listens better when it‚Äôs quiet.‚Äù

And then she hung up.

I tried staying out. Took Willow and found a diner. Ordered coffee I didn‚Äôt need. Sat with my back to the wall.

Around 4 a.m., the waitress came by. Refilled my cup.

And as she placed it down, its voice came out of her mouth.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be able to notice me.‚Äù

Then she walked away like nothing happened.

This morning, while brushing my teeth, I felt it.

Not behind me. Not beside me.

In front of me.

Too close.

And in that space ‚Äî not with eyes, but with something else ‚Äî I saw it.

A face. My face. Grinning wide.

It hovered there. Inches away.

No breath. No warmth. Just‚Ä¶ watching.

I dropped the toothbrush and ran. I slammed the door. I couldn‚Äôt scream.

I don‚Äôt know what this thing is.

But I know this:

I was blind my whole life.

And now I can see one thing.

Just one.

And it‚Äôs getting closer.

If you‚Äôre reading this‚Ä¶ it means I lived long enough to hit ‚Äúpost.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be alive when you read it.

I don‚Äôt know if I should be.

At 2:51 a.m., I felt it coming.

Not like before ‚Äî not from the closet.

From the building itself. Floor by floor. Closer.

I stood in my living room. Heart pounding. Willow shaking at my feet.

And then‚Ä¶ silence.

Real silence.

Like reality stopped vibrating.

Then its voice came ‚Äî behind my thoughts:

‚ÄúYou called me into shape. Now you have to see.‚Äù

And suddenly, I saw everything.

Not the world. Not the room.

It.

All of it.

A body made of space. Skin stretched over nothing. Long arms. Twisting joints.
No mouth ‚Äî but still, it smiled.

And then it touched my forehead.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I couldn‚Äôt move. My ribs are broken. My mouth tastes like blood.

The closet door is open.

And I heard my voice ‚Äî my exact voice ‚Äî say from outside:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to work.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt me.

It said it perfectly.

It‚Äôs out there now.

Wearing me.

I was blind my whole life.

And now I can see it.

That‚Äôs all it ever wanted.

To be seen.

To be real.

And now‚Ä¶ it is.

Edit:

1l2n0aw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l2n0aw,How to never stop being sad?,"Time has proven that fooling yourself into believing a lie
Is the most effective way to deal with things
You have no control over

Keep listening to the mixtapes they made you
Overanalyze every single word you hear
Was this a sign that things were going wrong?
No, no, you were the one that cared too hard, not them

Stay up every single night staring at your phone
Either attempting to gather up the courage to turn these demons
These constant reminders of your loneliness
Into nothing more than a bad dream
Or praying just for one second
You could feel the warmth of equally returned love

Go out for coffee four times a week by yourself
Always bring your notebook, never stop writing
Leave little comics and thank you notes with your tip
Watch them smile as you get in your car

Talk down on yourself whenever possible
My life is shit because I deserve it, right?
You must have done something really bad
It's nearly impossible for you to cry now

Avoid your friends for weeks even though
They're the only sense of consistency you have left in your life
If they really wanted to see you they'd come, but they won't
Who cares?

Allow yourself to lose interest in the things you love
Watch as you begin to take a backseat
To the world around you, don't fight it
Become a secondary character in your own motion picture

But most importantly
Drown every single one of your feelings in old stolen rum
Learn to love the taste of it dripping down your throat
Find comfort in the warmth coming from your stomach
You're drinking bottled love now

You don't need other people to drive away your loneliness
You just needed to find a way to talk to it",3,1748983819.0,TeenIndia,0,1.0,False

I thought maybe it was a mistake in the recipe but the comments where very happy. Today I tried again, looking on other recipes, but they all indicate the same kind of measures / proportions.

I tried one of the recipes without adding the water, since the consistency of the batter was already looking perfect. It was absolutely delicious btw and I don‚Äôt see how an extra cup of water wouldn‚Äôt have ruin the all thing.

I‚Äôm a breastfeeding mama and I‚Äôve been slowly reintroducing egg into my diet as per dietitian advice‚Äîvery carefully and by the book, because we all know how nerve-wracking it can be when there‚Äôs a risk of reaction. The good news: no issues so far!

Here‚Äôs the twist though‚Ä¶ I just realised a product I‚Äôve been eating regularly actually contains both egg and dairy (missed it on the label üòÖ). I‚Äôve been having it for a couple of weeks now and my 10-month-old hasn‚Äôt had any reactions‚Äîno skin flares, no mucus, no gas or funny nappies.

Also, a couple of days ago I was handed the wrong iced coffee (milk-based), took a few swigs before noticing, and still‚Äînothing.

Note for clarity and transparency: it was chocolate. I found some lush chocolate in the ‚Äúfree from‚Äù section that looked too good to be true‚Ä¶ and apparently it was üò¨ but still, no reaction.

I‚Äôll be checking in with the dietitian (they can take a while to get back to me), but I‚Äôm wondering: what‚Äôs been your experience with reintroducing allergens this way while breastfeeding? And when did you feel it was the right time to let your little one try those foods directly?

¬†Our UK KFA delegation visited the DPRK from the 11th of August until the 19th of August to participate in the great 5th International Festival in Praise of the Great Persons born of Mt Paektu ( the great leader President¬†**KIM IL SUNG**¬†, Chairman¬†**KIM JONG I**L, respected Marshal¬†**KIM JONG UN**¬†and anti-Japanese woman heroine Madame¬†**KIM JONG SUK .**¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†It was my 14th visit to the DPRK.Our delegation arrived in Pyongyang on the 11th of August after a chaotic and difficult transit through Beijing the capital of Chinese revisionism.¬†Beijing airport seems to be chaotic and inefficient It is full of capitalist advertising .It is a prime example of an over-expanded airport and symbolic of globalisation which is a toxic disease destroying countries. Our difficulty was that the delegation were on different flights . This should not have been a problem however the flight I was on¬†just sat on the runaway for nearly an hour without letting the passengers off . Then the Air Koryo plane to Pyongyang was delayed by nearly 2 hours from leaving , we do not know why .!¬† ¬†Our plane glided into the DPRK , we soared over the revolutionary sites where the martyrs of the anti-Japanese war led by the great leader President¬†**KIM IL SUNG l**ay . We were glad to arrive at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport and to be away from the chaos of Beijing airport .In contrast to the globalised mess of Beijing airport , you could only see the planes of the DPRK national airline AIr Koryo in Pyongyang Airport.We ¬†were greeted at the airport by comrade Ham Sung Jin who is secretary general of the Korean Committee for Friendship with the British People .Later when we got on the bus we met our translators Miss Kim , a pretty and bright young girl from the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies and Mr Zang a graduate student from the same university .We were accommodated at the splendid 47 storey ¬†Yangkaddo Hotel which is on an island on the River Taedong in Pyongyang . My room had a great view of Pyongyang including the Juche Idea Tower, I could also see the Koryo Hotel which I had stayed in many times.¬†¬†¬† Our guide comrade Ham made a short speech on the coach on the way to Pyongyang saying that we had come at a very difficult time , a time of very acute tension. Only days before we travelled the increasingly deranged and idiotic buffoon who occupies the position of US president talked of unleashing ""Fire and fury "" against People's Korea , this followed the imposition of severe sanctions by the¬† UN Security Council(a corrupt and venal body entirely controlled by US imperialism and big powers). The Yankee imperialists had been stunned by the¬† test fires of the Hwasong-14 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile on the 4th of July and the 29th of July. Thus the DPRK has emerged as a socialist nuclear power of Juche and an ICBM launching nation . The US imperialists are now on their deathbed and have resorted to desperate and reckless to try and prevent the emergence of a nuclear DPRK and to stifle to socialist system of the DPRK. It is a fact that when the US , the UNSC , Japan , EU , Russia, China and the south Korean puppets talk about the denuclearisiation of the DPRK they really mean breaking up the socialist system of the DPRK . The US defence secretary talked about the ""destruction of the people "" of the DPRK .¬†¬†¬† The DPRK has not taken these threats laying down but instead the Strategic Rocket Force of the Korean People's Army declared that they would submit a plan for a strike by¬†Hwasong-12¬† missiles on the US occupied island of Guam. On the 15th of August ,whilst we were staying in the DPRK, dear respected Marshal¬†**KIM JONG UN**¬†visited the¬†Command of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army and¬†praised the KPA Strategic Force for having drawn up a close and careful plan as intended by the Party and examined the firing preparations for power demonstration. He warned that if the US persist in their foolhardy and reckless provocations then the strike plan will be carried out .¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  
People in the DPRK were not bowed or intimidated by the US imperialist threats . They were going about their business quite normally and calmly . Indeed when I attended the Karoake and dinner on the last night the idea of war seemed quite surreal and far off. However the Korean people have a heightened anti-US,anti-imperialist spirit. Two days before we arrived there was a massive rally against the¬†UNSC sanctions. New anti-US posters have gone up in the streets of Pyongyang .We also saw members of the Red Young Guards marching up Kwangbok streetwith Red flags and placards which called for smashing the 'secret warfare' and 'regime change' plans of the US imperialists and world reactionaries . This was a deeply inspiring sight ¬†as it showed the revolutionary and militant nature of People's Korea guided by the great Juche idea . No other country in the world is so strong in anti-imperialist spirit and revolutionary ardour ! It was a great contrast to the neighbouring country , China, where all kinds of capitalist rubbish are readily accepted and a contrast to the tired , worn out bureaucratic revisionist led socialist countries of Europe that I had visited in the 1980s. So long as People's Korea is guided by the militant anti-imperialist Juche idea and self-reliance¬† it can never collapse!¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  
Holding the ¬†Festival ¬†was in itself a blow against US imperialism . Some 300 delegates from all over the globe, all continents being represented ¬†had braved threats of war by US imperialism to come to People's Korea the land of Juche . In fact there were so many countries it was hard to list them all / One lie is that the DPRK is isolated but were so many people in Pyongyang including a former Nepalese Prime Minister ¬†and representatives of the World Peace Council and the¬†Organisation for Solidarity with Asian , African ¬†and Latin American Peoples.¬†The Korean Friendship Association (KFA) was represented by¬† delegations from the UK, Spain,Belgium , Cyprus , Estonia ,Switzerland Thailand and Ireland . There was a great buzz and a great vibe with meeting all sorts of different people.¬† ¬†Undoubtedly the high point of the trip was going up Mt Paektu , the sacred mountain of the Korean revolution and spiritual birthplace of the great Korean nation .Although I had visited the DPRK over 10 times ¬†I had never been to Mt Paektu ¬†We travelled to the far northeastern part of the DPRK by an Air Koryo domestic flight , my first time on a DPRK domestic flight. Our plane landed at the¬†charming Samjiyon airport .¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  
¬†The scenery ¬†of the region was breathtaking to say the least , awe inspiring and like nothing I had seen before . What is incredible is that we drove through a thick forest for over a hour , this shows that the DPRK takes care of the environment .The air in the area around Mt Paektu and Samjiyon is even purer and cleaner than in Pyongyang . I would like to live in the area as I know that I would feel very healthy and live long .The town of Samjiyon in the north of the DPRK is very clean, neat and tidy,. Here people looked just as well as in Pyongyang and had mobile phones. There was no sign of poverty or destitution . Friendly people waved to us .¬†¬†waved to us¬†.We saw new buildings under construction there .¬† ¬† We went first to the Samjiyon Grand Monument . A truly remarkable place which shows the great exploits of the great leader comrade¬†**KIM IL SUNG**¬†in leading the anti-Japanese armed struggle to victory. I had seen pictures of this place in books¬†but never visited it before.¬† ¬† We were accommodated in the excellent Pegabong hotel where we were treated to an excellent open air performance of the local school children . The educational level of the children here is the same as Pyongyang . I had heard some negative reports about the Pegabong Hotel but it was well run and had hot water and electricity all night.It was also warm .¬† ¬†On the morning of Monday 14th of August we woke up early and left the hotel by 6am . We¬†we drove to Mt Paektu by bus.Mt Paetku is 2,700 metres above sea level .The buses ascended the steep road to the peak . We got out where it was no longer possible for the bus to travel . You have to see Mt Paektu in reality not just read about it.The scenery is simply breathtaking ¬†I had been up mountains in Scotland but Mt Paektu was really different to these. We could look down and see¬†Lake Chon , a volcanic lake, which had clear blue water .¬†We held a rally on the mountain with both speeches and poems .There were speakers from Guinea , Pakistan and Peru . The meeting adopted¬†¬†the Paektusan declaration . We marched down the mountain with a banner .¬† ¬† The adoption of the Mt Paektu declaration was highly significant.¬†¬†The spirit of Mt Paektu is the spirit of independence, The Mt Paektu spirit of independence , Juche and self-reliance permeates the whole of the DPRK and the country pulsates with independence and self-reliance. It is this spirit of independence and self-reliance that is enabling the Korean people to smash the sanctions of the US , the UNSC and the big power chauvinists . It is worth adding here that we saw no effect of sanctions on the DPRK . New buildings are rising and I could hear construction work going on outside my hotel all night . The DPRK seems to become more self-reliant each day , for example canned iced coffee is a popular drink in the DPRK , previously this had been imported or produced under licence in the DPRK but now the DPRK is producing its own cans of iced coffee.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  
¬†We also visited the Secret Camp on Mt Paektu which is the birthplace of the great leader comrade¬†**KIM JONG IL**¬†and was the headquarters of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army(KPRA) . The scenery here is just as breathtaking as on Mt Paektu . We could see Jong Il Peak rising in the distance with sheer incredible majesty . There were clear streams that were refreshing to look at , it was tempting to drink the water from these streams . A¬†red flag was proudly flying from the log cabin that had been the HQ of the KPRA . This was striking symbolism as the DPRK virtually alone in the world is upholding the red flag and maintaining socialist principles even though others,such as the Soviet revisionists and the Chinese , have thrown it down shamefully.¬† ¬†On August 15th the¬†¬†Gathering 2017-Praise to the Great Persons of Mt Paektu was held at the People's Palace of Culture . In attendance were leading figures of the DPRK government such as Kim Yong Nam , Kim Ki Man ¬†and Ri Su Gyong . The chairwoman of the Korean Committee for Cultural Relations was presiding over the gathering ¬†with keynote speeches made by Peter Woods from Australia and Madhav Kumar the former prime minister of Nepal., On Wednesday our delegation participated in the international Solidarity meeting with the Korean People which was presided over by a leading official of the World Peace Council. A representative of OSPAAL addressed the meeting and I also spoke.We were able to witness first hand ¬†the pain of the division of Korea caused by brutish US imperialism at Panmunjom as well as witnessing that the US admitted its defeat in Korea by signing the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27th. Looking around the Armistice hall I saw that not only was US imperialism defeated in 1953 but also in the Pueblo incident of 1968, the EC121 incident of 1969 and many other cases. We also saw materials on captured US and south Korean spies. At Panmunjom we saw the monument to the autograph of the great leader President¬†**KIM IL SUNG**¬†on the document for national reunification . Had the proposals set down by the great leader comrade¬†**KIM IL SUNG**¬†for national reunification had been accepted by south Korea and US troops withdrawn Korea would have been reunified a long time ago. I had a chat about the Juche idea with a friendly KPA Officer .¬† ¬† As well as Panmunjom and Samjiyon we also travelled to Mt Myohyang to see the International Friendship Exhibition . Travelling to different parts of the DPRK by road we saw lush fields of crops . The imperialists had been making propaganda that the DPRK was affected by drought and that there would even be ¬†massive famine. However during our visit it rained several times and we were told that the effects of the drought had been overcome .¬†¬† We were able to see the great scientific potenial of People's Korea¬† when we visited the Sci-Tech Complex. Here we had a joint meeting with the satelitte scientists of the DPRK National Aerospace Development Adminstration . They explained the history of the DPRK satellite programme and the foundation of NADA . They pointed out that is the independent and sovereign right of the DPRK to pursue space exploration¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  
Another lie was proved false during our visit . The Wikipedia claims that the DPRK has 10 year compulsory military service . However in reality it is usually¬†3 years and there is no conscription because everyone wants to join the Army to fight the Yankees and defend the country , so there is no shortage of recruits for the army so no need for conscription.¬† ¬† ¬†We also learnt an interesting fact . In the DPRK a mobile phone costs only0.32 dollars for 3 months with 200 minutes of calls per month ! This is incredible when you compare to the high costs of mobile phones in the UK . Most people in the DPRK have mobile phones .It is a true peoples paradise.¬† Our delegation was able to enjoy an excellent performance by the Samjiyon band at the majestic East Pyongyang Grand Theatre , we also saw the splendid Manyondae Childrens Palace and the Fatherland Liberation War Museum.We paid our respects to the great leaders comrades¬†**KIM IL SUNG**¬†and¬†**KIM JONG IL**¬†at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. We ¬†also visited the birthplace of the great leader comrade¬†**KIM IL SUNG**¬†at Mangyondae .¬†¬†Our delegation and¬†the Swiss delegation had an¬†excellent meeting with our comrades in arms the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front ¬†of south Korea.The chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the AINDF explained the struggle for reunification in south Korea and demolished any illusions about the so-called 'liberal' government in south Korea.¬†I also attended a function organised by the Korean Association of Social Scientists held at Okryu restaurant The food was excellent and the staff were very helpful . The next day I had¬†¬†a separate meeting with KASS professor Kim Chang Gyong.¬† ¬† ¬† We took part in many state functions and events. I met comrade Kim Yong Nam , Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  
  
.For me most memorable was the impromptu dinner and Karaoke organised by the Cultural Relations Committee . I was amazed at myself participating in the Karaoke after a beautiful waitress took my hand and led me on to the stage.I was greatly honoured to receive ¬†the Order of Friendship Second Class and also win a prize in the International Literary contest .Such a great atmosphere it was sad to leave¬†!

I work in a warehouse doing 10-hour shifts and I'm literally buying 2-3 cans a day just to stay awake. Each one is like $2.50-3.00 at the vending machine, and I never thought about it adding up until I saw my bank statement.  
  
My coworker said this is ""totally normal"" for our type of work but idk... $160 a month feels like a lot? That's almost $2k a year just on energy drinks lol  
Like I could probably buy a decent used laptop or put that toward fixing my car instead. But without the caffeine I'm literally falling asleep on my feet by hour 6.  
I tried bringing coffee from home but it doesn't hit the same, and the break room coffee tastes like it was made in 1987.  
Is this just part of having a physical job or am I being ridiculous? How much do other people spend on stuff like this to get through work?  
  
Also side question - are there cheaper ways to not feel like a zombie for 10 hours straight? I already sleep 7-8 hours most nights so I don't think that's the issue.",102,1748982807.0,NoStupidQuestions,169,0.83,False

I know Reddit isn‚Äôt exactly known for great or long-term connections, but hey, figured I‚Äôd put this out there for anyone looking for something a bit more real than the swipe fatigue.



I‚Äôm 28, based in the UK, and no, I don‚Äôt actually go around saying, 'right, what‚Äôs all this then?' If that joke or meme is a mystery to you, feel free to ignore my nonsense lol. I‚Äôm not expecting instant replies, life happens, but it‚Äôd be nice to find something that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



I‚Äôm a massive fiction nerd. After work, all I want is to disappear into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back into reading history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly just Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I‚Äôm seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it‚Äôs in a slightly unconventional way. Definitely better than abandoning it altogether, even if uni tried its best to crush my soul with an enormous reading list. Spoiler: I never followed it. This is me, master of excuses and self-justifications. üòÄ If you‚Äôre into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.



Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I‚Äôve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I‚Äôm deep in the running cult. Minus the influencer energy. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I‚Äôm definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.

As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? ü§£



Now that I‚Äôve rambled like I‚Äôm overly caffeinated, (cough cough,) I am, it‚Äôs only fair you tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your thing? What‚Äôs the hobby or obsession you‚Äôd like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I‚Äôm into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before we know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. For me, amazing conversations are when we forget about time, doesn't matter whether it's serious or lighthearted, the next thing we know, we've been chatting for hours. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, wherever it leads, friendship or something with sparks. I‚Äôm open to wherever it goes, as long as it‚Äôs real.



Got a book that‚Äôll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn‚Äôt involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I‚Äôm listening.

1l2mj6j,https://i.redd.it/76wabkhjvr4f1.jpeg,MMPR (FANFIC) UNIVERSE 42 chapter 4,"Chapter 4
Goldar materialized in a burst of flame and ash, the heat of his arrival scorching the ancient stone beneath his massive feet. His wings folded back, and he knelt, his golden armor clinking softly in the grand, shadowed hall of Rita Repulsa's castle. The air was thick with the scent of dark magic and incense, and the flickering candlelight cast eerie shadows on the opulent, towering columns adorned with intricate carvings of serpentine creatures and ancient runes.

Rita, seated upon her elaborate throne of twisted metal and dark crystals, gazed down at Goldar with a cold, imperious stare. Her eyes, a deep emerald that seemed to glow with their own malevolent light, fixed on him with a mixture of disdain and expectation. She wore an elegant, high-collared robe that flowed around her like liquid night, the green highlights shimmering as she shifted.

""You have failed me, Goldar,"" she intoned, her voice low and dripping with a venomous elegance that chilled the air. Goldar's head bowed lower, his eyes reflecting both shame and a fierce, unwavering loyalty.

""Mistress, they were stronger than anticipated,"" he rumbled, his voice filled with a mix of fear and a desperate need for her approval. Rita‚Äôs lips curled into a cruel, knowing smile, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the arm of her throne.

""Excuses are the refuge of the weak. Remember, my pet,"" she purred, each word a silken lash, her reach extended to caress his chin, ""your strength is only as great as your loyalty to me. You will not disappoint me again."" The slap across his face echoed throughout the walls of her royal chamber. ‚ÄúImbecile! The stress alone will give me another headache.‚Äù

Goldar was used to such abuse from his Empress of Evil; to him, she was everything. His love for her twisted into an unyielding devotion that thrived on every lash of her scorn and every fleeting, backhanded compliment. The sting of her slap only deepened his resolve, a painful reminder of his place and his purpose. He had witnessed the darkest facets of her power, and despite the agony, he saw her as the embodiment of strength, an untouchable force of nature that he would follow into the abyss.

Rita's gaze softened momentarily, a cruel mimicry of tenderness, as she observed the smoldering loyalty in his eyes. She knew the power she held over him, a power she wielded with the finesse of a maestro conducting a symphony of suffering and obedience. Her hand lingered on his cheek, the faintest trace of warmth amidst the cold severity of her demeanor. 

""You are a valuable asset, Goldar,"" she murmured, her voice a deceptive whisper of affection, ""but even the strongest asset can be broken. Did we not anticipate Zordon recruiting a new team? You and Finster‚Äôs Putty creations should have been ready for such advancement compared to the primitive forces of the Earthlings.‚Äù

Goldar nodded, the steel in his resolve. ""I will not fail you again, Mistress,"" he vowed, his voice steady despite the turmoil within. He rose slowly, the fire in his eyes matching the smoldering embers that had heralded his arrival. Rita watched him with a predatory satisfaction, her twisted affection as dangerous as her wrath, knowing that her loyal servant would sooner face destruction than disappoint her again.

‚ÄúYou shall be bestowed with a second chance to create such havoc upon the troglodyte natives of this planet. Remember, we have an old mission still to be accomplished.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, oh, mighty Empress.‚Äù As Goldar turned to leave, the flicker of torches cast his shadow long and dark against the ancient walls. Each step was a silent promise to his Empress, a vow etched in pain and loyalty. For in the labyrinth of power and punishment that defined his existence, Goldar found purpose in serving the one who ruled his heart and spirit with an iron fist cloaked in shadowed elegance.

Traversing the corridors of the fortress, he sought out the laboratory of his sinister partner in crime. Finster was in the middle of one of his experiments. His lab was his domain; chambers of bubbling cauldrons, arcane machinery, and shelves lined with jars containing grotesque specimens. Finster's hands, gnarled and stained from years of alchemical and genetic manipulation, moved with precision as he assembled his latest monstrous creation. Here, his dark talents flourished unchecked, enabling him to transform his nightmarish visions into reality. To Finster, every grotesque creation was not just a weapon but a work of art, a manifestation of his unrelenting quest for perfection and acceptance in a universe that had cast him aside. Despite his servitude, there lingered within him a perverse pride in his craft, and a twisted fulfillment in seeing his monstrous concoctions wreak havoc upon the world under Rita's sinister command.

Despite his hunched appearance and frail frame, his eyes gleamed with a fervent, unsettling intensity. Every concoction, every creature, was a testament to his insidious brilliance‚Äîa dark reflection of his lifelong dedication to Rita‚Äôs cause. His current side project was to revive his lost wife, who perished long ago, even before Rita‚Äôs recruitment. From the very dirt that covered her grave, he formed a special clay, intending to animate it with her neurological brainwaves to imbue it with the memories she had just before her death.

The unfortunate paradox was that he was the cause of her demise. She had eventually feared him, subjected to a failed experiment gone horribly wrong. She called him a monster for what he became, and in a twisted attempt at redemption, he sought to correct her as he would a flawed experiment. When a clay clone of his deceased wife came to life, she would start screaming, making the same accusations as if it were the exact moment of her death. His perfectionist attitude saw this as a failure. The crude act of vaporizing and smashing the clay with a giant mallet would mark the starting point to begin the experiment anew.

Goldar entered just as he raised the mallet from the floor. When lifted, strands of slime reluctantly released from the metal, leaving behind a sticky residue. The mallet, once pristine, now bore evidence of the encounter. A testament to its strength and the resilience of the strange slime.

‚ÄúKnock it off with your restless attempts with the dead, we need more soldiers for our next attack on the humans.‚Äù he exclaimed.

‚ÄúAh, my feline companion. Yes, I was just cleaning up before I started working on the Empress‚Äô request.‚Äù Finster placed the mallet against the wall and gestured to the slime. ‚ÄúSorrow is the one who cannot perceive divine perfection.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Goldar rumbled, his massive wings rustling as he approached Finster‚Äôs workbench. He peered down at the bubbling cauldrons and arcane apparatuses, his gaze lingering on the grotesque forms of half-formed clay figures scattered about. Each one bore the unmistakable touch of Finster‚Äôs dark artistry, their misshapen limbs twitching sporadically as if eager to be brought to life.

‚ÄúWe need a new batch ready soon,‚Äù Goldar continued, his voice a low, gravelly growl that resonated through the dimly lit laboratory. ‚ÄúZordon‚Äôs new recruits are proving to be a more formidable challenge than anticipated.‚Äù Finster nodded sagely, his gnarled fingers reaching for a vial of shimmering liquid. 

‚ÄúFear not, my winged comrade. These new Putties will surpass their predecessors. Enhanced strength, resilience, and a touch of my own unique twist.‚Äù He poured the liquid into a vat filled with pulsating green goo, the mixture emitting a faint hiss as it reacted with the compound.

Goldar watched intently as Finster worked, his mind already envisioning the chaos these new creations would wreak upon the unsuspecting city. ‚ÄúThe Empress expects perfection,‚Äù he reminded, his eyes narrowing with a fierce determination. ‚ÄúWe cannot afford another failure.‚Äù

Finster chuckled softly, the sound akin to dry leaves rustling in a cold wind. ‚ÄúPerfection is within our grasp, my friend. With each creation, we inch closer to achieving absolute dominion over this world.‚Äù He stirred the mixture with a long, twisted rod, the slime within taking on a more defined shape. ‚ÄúThese Putties will be a testament to our unwavering dedication to the cause.‚Äù

As the laboratory buzzed with the ominous hum of machinery and a pungent aroma filled the air, soldiers of gray stone and hardened clay deposits marched forth through an archway on the other side of the machine.

‚ÄúAh! Well now, here we are!‚Äù Finster gleefully announced, his eyes gleaming with a twisted delight. He gestured proudly at the newly formed Putties, their stone and clay bodies gleaming under the flickering torchlight. ‚ÄúThese Putties will be more effective for the next encounter. I made similar variations back when we compromised the integrity of Zordon and his assistant‚Äôs physical forms.‚Äù

Goldar nodded approvingly, his wings flexing as he inspected the row of assembled creatures. Each Putty stood motionless, awaiting their orders with an eerie patience that sent a shiver down even Goldar‚Äôs formidable spine. ‚ÄúThey look formidable,‚Äù he rumbled, his voice tinged with a mixture of anticipation and ruthless determination. ‚ÄúThey will serve the Empress well.‚Äù

Finster cackled softly, a sound that echoed eerily through the laboratory. ‚ÄúOh, indeed they will, my loyal friend. These Putties are infused with enhanced strength and cunning, crafted to outmatch any resistance thrown their way.‚Äù He adjusted his glasses, the lenses glinting in the dim light. ‚ÄúWe shall unleash them upon the city when the time is right, and they shall pave the way for our ultimate victory.‚Äù

Together, the dark duo stood admiring the new fleet, their creations poised to strike fear into the hearts of those who dared oppose Rita Repulsa‚Äôs insidious reign. In the depths of the laboratory, surrounded by shadows and the echoes of their malevolent laughter, Goldar and Finster plotted the downfall of their enemies, their allegiance to evil and their thirst for power insatiable.

‚Ä¶

After the final bell rang, signaling the end of another school day at Angel Grove High, Peter found himself lost in thought as he navigated the bustling hallways. The events of the previous day weighed heavily on his mind. The sudden appearances of these alien forces both good and evil, the mysterious powers they had been granted, and the daunting responsibility that came with it all. He couldn't shake the feeling of secrecy surrounding their newfound roles as Power Rangers.

Wyatt spotted Peter near his locker, his brow furrowed in deep contemplation. ""Hey, Peter!"" Wyatt called out, catching his attention. It wasn‚Äôt hard seeing as he towered a bit over the rest of their peers. Wyatt was also sporting a vibrant blue pullover and khaki cargo pants. Peter looked up, his thoughts momentarily interrupted by Wyatt's friendly demeanor.

""Hey, Wyatt,"" Peter replied, offering a faint smile. They exchanged a quick nod of acknowledgment before Wyatt fell into step beside him. As they made their way out of the school building, Peter's mind raced with questions about their enigmatic mentors.

""Have I ever told you, this bomber jacket fits you really well. Ironically too since it matches,‚Äù Wyatt leaned in with a whisper, ‚Äúyour armor.‚Äù Peter gave a smirk and a small half hearted laugh.
‚ÄúYou're being quiet today,"" Wyatt remarked, glancing sideways at Peter. ""Everything okay?""

Peter hesitated for a moment, unsure of how much he could confide in Wyatt. ""Yeah, just trying to process everything that happened yesterday,"" he finally admitted, his voice low. 
""I mean, Zordon and Alpha‚Äîthey're not like anything I've ever seen or heard of. And the way they talked about our powers... it's all a bit overwhelming.""

Wyatt nodded in understanding. ""I get it. It's a lot to take in,"" he said sympathetically. ""But hey, we're in this together, right? Whatever questions we have, we'll figure it out as a team.""

Peter managed a small smile of gratitude. ""Yeah, you're right,"" he agreed, feeling reassured by Wyatt's words. ‚ÄúI think we should discuss this as a team together before we go back there. That way we are all on the same page.‚Äù

Wyatt agreed.""Let's head to Paxton's. We can meet up with the others and talk more there. I‚Äôll text the others""

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you had Mel and Jamie‚Äôs numbers.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease. I have everyone‚Äôs contact info in the school. You‚Äôd be surprised how much you can access from the school‚Äôs wifi.‚Äù Peter shook his head at his new friend and they continued their walk.

Paxton's Coffee House buzzed with its usual afternoon energy when Peter and Wyatt arrived. The aroma of freshly ground coffee beans mingled with the sweet scent of pastries, creating a comforting atmosphere. The corner couch, strategically placed by a vintage chessboard, was unoccupied‚Äîa perfect spot for their group to gather and discuss.

Melody was already there when Peter and Wyatt walked in, her alternative style standing out against the backdrop of the cozy cafe. She glanced up from her sketchbook, her eyes lighting up as she spotted them. ""Hey, guys!"" She greeted them warmly, waving them over to the counter while sipping her chai latte.

Jamie arrived next, his stride purposeful as he approached the group. He gave a nod of acknowledgment to Peter and Wyatt as he took off his sunglasses before settling into the couch, pulling out his laptop with a slight air of importance.

""Hey,"" Peter greeted them with a small smile, feeling a sense of relief to be among friends who shared the same extraordinary burden.

Wyatt took the initiative to order drinks for everyone‚Äîa decaf drip coffee with almond milk for Kaylee, a cold brew latte with vanilla for himself, and a black coffee for Peter, knowing his preference for simplicity. Jamie stepped in before Wyatt could assume his preferred drink of choice: a double espresso macchiato to keep him awake from the nap he had during his last period.

As they settled in, Peter felt the weight of their shared secret pressing upon him once more. ""Guys,"" he began, his voice serious but tinged with determination, ""we need to talk about what happened yesterday. I can't stop thinking about it.""

Melody closed her sketchbook, her expression turning thoughtful. ""I've been sketching, trying to distract myself,"" she admitted, ""but I can't shake the feeling that there's so much we don't know.""

Jamie leaned forward. ""I've been researching,"" he confessed, ""but there's very little information about the attack yesterday besides what the media has already stated. It's like they're keeping people in the dark on purpose.""

Wyatt handed out the drinks and took a seat, his expression serious. ""Maybe there's a reason for that,"" he suggested quietly. ""Maybe they're protecting us from something bigger.""

Peter nodded, his mind racing with possibilities. ""I just wish we had more answers,"" he murmured, his gaze flickering to the chessboard as if searching for clarity amidst the familiar pieces.

As they settled into their discussion, the bell above the door chimed, signaling the entrance of another member of their group. Kaylee hurried in, slightly out of breath from track practice, her natural hair tied back in a messy ponytail. She scanned the cafe quickly, her eyes lighting up as she spotted her friends gathered in the corner.

""Hey, everyone,"" Kaylee greeted with a bright smile, sliding into an open spot next to Melody. She set her water bottle down on the table and took a deep breath. ""Sorry I'm late. Practice went a bit long today.""

""No worries,"" Peter reassured her, offering a sympathetic smile. ""We just started talking about what happened yesterday.""

Wyatt handed Kaylee her decaf drip coffee with almond milk, which he had already ordered knowing her usual preference. ""You missed Jamie's theory about them hiding something big from us,"" Wyatt summarized, catching Kaylee up in the conversation.

Kaylee nodded thoughtfully as she took a sip of her coffee. ""It wouldn't surprise me,"" she mused, her brow furrowing slightly. ""We're dealing with aliens, ancient powers, and these weird monsters now. Feels like we're just scratching the surface.""

Melody leaned forward, her expression serious. ""And Zordon and Alpha,"" she added, concern evident in her voice. ""They didn‚Äôt give us a lot of information. Either they plan on filling us in today or they seem to just want us to be their fighting force but aren't telling us everything.""

‚ÄúIs that why you hesitated?‚Äù Wyatt asked.

‚ÄúYeah. We don‚Äôt know the implications of what we agreed to.‚Äù She took another sip of her drink, and in a mocking voice, ‚ÄúWe were chosen by some grid and now we have super powers?‚Äù

Jamie closed his laptop momentarily, joining in the discussion. ""Exactly,"" he agreed, his tone reflecting his analytical mindset. ""It's like they're guiding us, but keeping us in the dark at the same time.""

Peter nodded, feeling a sense of unity among his friends. ""We need to find out more,"" he asserted firmly. ""We can't just sit around waiting for answers.""

‚ÄúDo we even know how to get back there to question them?‚Äù Melody questioned the group. She made a subtle gesture to hush their voices so as to not let others hear in on their discussion.

‚ÄúI believe the morphers would send us there.‚Äù Wyatt patted his pocket where he kept his at the moment.

The group fell into a thoughtful silence, each lost in their own contemplation of the mysterious forces that had thrust them into this unexpected role as protectors of Angel Grove. Around them, the sounds of the cafe faded into the background as they focused on the daunting task ahead. That‚Äôs when the bell rang again and two familiar faces entered the cafe.

The door clanged open with a burst of energy as Bulk and Skull strode in, a stark contrast to the laid-back vibe of the place. Bulk, a sturdy figure with an insatiable appetite for chaos and snacks, gazed hungrily at the display of canned drinks, his eyes locking onto an oversized can of energy drink. Skull, his wiry counterpart, scanned the menu with a mischievous glint in his eye.

‚ÄúOne can of Turbo Pulse, a protein bar, a hot pretzel, and can I get a spicy hot chocolate with whipped cream,‚Äù Skull called to the barista, his voice cutting through the ambient murmur of the cafe.

Paxton, the 20-something owner of the cafe, nodded and began preparing the order. He was a distinctive figure with medium-length cyan hair peeking out from under a backwards baseball cap. His flannel shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and tan, thick cloth apron tied at the waist gave him a hipster barista vibe. He moved with practiced ease, his hands deftly assembling the eclectic order.

As Paxton handed Skull his spicy hot chocolate, he couldn't help but comment, ‚ÄúGoing for an interesting combo today, Skull?‚Äù

Skull grinned, accepting the cup with a theatrical bow. ‚ÄúWhat can I say? I like to keep things exciting plus this one needs his regular bar.‚Äù

Bulk, meanwhile, grabbed his can of energy drink and ripped it open with an enthusiastic flourish, the sound causing a few heads to turn. He took a long gulp, the caffeine rush visible in his eyes as he surveyed the room, his gaze lingering on the group huddled in the corner.

Peter shifted uncomfortably in his seat, feeling the scrutiny of Bulk's stare. Wyatt caught the look and leaned in, whispering, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep it cool. We don‚Äôt need a repeat of your fight from before.‚Äù

Melody discreetly tucked her sketchbook away, her eyes darting towards Bulk and Skull with a mix of wariness and curiosity. Jamie casually pulled out his phone, pretending to be absorbed in it, though he remained keenly aware of the new arrivals.

Kaylee, still catching her breath from track practice, took a sip of her coffee and murmured, ‚ÄúGreat, just what we need‚Äîan audience.‚Äù

Bulk and Skull, oblivious to the Rangers‚Äô unease, settled at a nearby table, Skull chatting animatedly about his favorite MMO game, his excitement palpable. As Skull went on about the latest updates and quests to Bulk, Wyatt couldn‚Äôt help but feel a flicker of interest despite himself.

‚ÄúDid you hear about the new expansion?‚Äù Skull's voice carried over to their table. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs supposed to have this awesome new questline.‚Äù

Wyatt‚Äôs ears perked up at the mention of the game. He exchanged a quick glance with Kaylee, who gave a subtle nod, acknowledging the common interest.

Paxton, ever the attentive barista, couldn‚Äôt resist a friendly remark. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre pretty into it, Skull. Maybe you should start a gaming club here.‚Äù

Skull laughed, his eyes twinkling with enthusiasm. ‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs an idea! Maybe I‚Äôll bring my setup next time.‚Äù

Bulk, munching on his protein bar, chimed in with his mouth half-full, ‚ÄúYeah, and we could show these amateurs how it‚Äôs done.‚Äù He elbowed Skull, who grinned in agreement.

Wyatt turned back to his friends, his curiosity piqued despite the gravity of their own situation. ‚ÄúHey, maybe we should check it out sometime,‚Äù he said to Peter and the others, trying to inject a bit of normalcy into their unusual lives. ‚ÄúMight be a good distraction from all the... you know, Ranger stuff. I actually meant to play that in my off time.‚Äù

Peter smiled faintly, appreciating the attempt to lighten the mood. ‚ÄúYeah, it could be fun,‚Äù he agreed. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs focus on figuring out what we can about Zordon and Alpha for now.‚Äù

Kaylee, pulling her athletic bag closer, nodded. ‚ÄúRight. We need to understand what we‚Äôre dealing with if we‚Äôre going to do this right.‚Äù

Paxton, who had been serving drinks to a nearby table, chimed in, ‚ÄúYou know, sometimes a bit of distraction helps clear the mind. Just saying. Cool character names too. Sounds futuristic?‚Äù

Jamie raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYeah. Total space odyssey. But, Paxton, you‚Äôre right. Maybe not today, but we should keep it in mind.‚Äù Jamie, from out of Paxton‚Äôs view, widened his eyes to cue the others to wrap things up before they were overheard.

Peter caught Jamie‚Äôs signal and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúAlright, guys, let‚Äôs head out and talk strategy,‚Äù he suggested, standing up and gesturing to the quieter area of the cafe.

Wyatt nodded, gathering his drink and belongings. ‚ÄúYeah, sounds good. Let‚Äôs make sure we‚Äôre all on the same page.‚Äù

The five of them left and went around to the back alley of the establishment to talk without prying ears.

‚ÄúOkay, now that we‚Äôre away from prying ears, let‚Äôs figure out what we know and what we need to find out about Zordon and Alpha.‚Äù Melody suggested.

Kaylee leaned forward, her expression serious. ‚ÄúWe need to know why they chose us and what exactly they expect us to do. This can‚Äôt just be about fighting random monsters.‚Äù

Wyatt agreed. ‚ÄúAnd what about their history? They clearly have a long-standing feud with Rita and her minions. Understanding that might help us anticipate their next moves.‚Äù

Jamie, keeping mental notes, nodded thoughtfully. ‚ÄúRight. And we should also think about how to keep our identities safe. The more we know, the better we can prepare.‚Äù

Peter looked around at his friends, feeling a renewed sense of determination. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs get to work. We‚Äôve got a lot to figure out, but we‚Äôre in this together.‚Äù He looked to Wyatt and took out his morpher. ‚ÄúHow do you suppose we use these things to go there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we just have to present them and concentrate like when we were morphed?‚Äù guessed Wyatt.

Peter nodded, considering his input. ‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs worth a try. Let‚Äôs think about the command center, everything we remember about it.‚Äù

Peter took a deep breath, trying to recall the details of the command center‚Äîthe strange symbols, the advanced technology, the imposing presence of Zordon‚Äôs holographic form. He closed his eyes and focused his mind on those images, hoping the others were doing the same.

As they concentrated, the morphers began to glow faintly, a low hum resonating from within the devices. The light grew brighter, enveloping them in a soft aura. Peter felt a strange pull, as if his body was being drawn towards the image in his mind. The sensation intensified, and before he knew it, the world around him dissolved into a blur of colors.

When the light faded, they found themselves standing in the familiar, albeit alien, surroundings of the command center. The command consoles hummed with activity, and Zordon‚Äôs visage appeared, flickering to life within his containment tube.

‚ÄúWelcome, Rangers,‚Äù Zordon‚Äôs voice boomed with a mixture of warmth and authority. ‚ÄúI see you have learned to harness your powers well.‚Äù

Peter glanced at his friends, a mix of excitement and apprehension reflected in their eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here because we need answers, Zordon,‚Äù he said, stepping forward. ‚ÄúWe need to know more about you, Alpha, and what‚Äôs really at stake.‚Äù

Zordon‚Äôs expression turned solemn. ‚ÄúYour questions are valid, Peter. There is much you need to understand about the forces you now stand against, and about the history that binds us all.‚Äù

Alpha 5, bustling around the control panels, turned to face the group. ‚ÄúAy-yi-yi! There‚Äôs so much to cover, but we‚Äôll start from the beginning. You deserve to know the truth.‚Äù

The Rangers exchanged uncertain glances, bracing themselves for the revelations to come. The command center dimmed slightly as Zordon‚Äôs face became more serious, the blue glow of his tube casting an eerie light over the room.

‚ÄúMany millennia ago,‚Äù Zordon began, his voice resonating with ancient wisdom, ‚Äúthere was a great battle between good and evil across the cosmos. I was a warrior in the battle against the sorceress Rita Repulsa. Her ambition to conquer the universe knew no bounds, and her powers grew to be a significant threat to all that is good. The Power Rangers were formed to combat such threats, protect the innocent, and maintain balance.‚Äù

Peter listened intently, his mind racing to grasp the magnitude of what Zordon was describing. The idea that they were now part of a lineage of protectors, fighting an age-old battle, was both daunting and awe-inspiring.

‚ÄúRita‚Äôs imprisonment,‚Äù Zordon continued, ‚Äúwas achieved through a combined effort of many brave souls. But the seal could not hold her forever. As you‚Äôve experienced, she has returned, and with her come forces that seek to plunge the world into darkness.‚Äù

Melody's eyes widened, her hand clutching her morpher as she processed the weight of their mission. ‚ÄúAnd Alpha?‚Äù she asked, looking at the robot with newfound curiosity. ‚ÄúHow does he fit into all this?‚Äù

Alpha 5‚Äôs lights flickered slightly as he addressed the question. ‚ÄúI was once a Ranger like you. My original body was damaged in the battles surrounding Rita‚Äôs sealing. While there was only one logical option for who would enter the power tube to regenerate,‚Äù‚ÄîAlpha glanced at Zordon with a hint of reverence‚Äî‚ÄúI began making advancements to accommodate my disabilities. With each upgrade I applied, I became a new series. I am now what is referred to as an Artificial Lifeform with Preserved Human Awareness‚ÄîALPHA, Series 5.‚Äù

The Rangers looked at Alpha with newfound respect, realizing that his cheerful demeanor belied a complex and storied past.

‚ÄúI am now an assistant,‚Äù Alpha continued, ‚Äúcreated to aid Zordon in the continued fight against evil. My purpose is to provide support, manage the command center, and help train and guide the Power Rangers in various ranks. I‚Äôve been with Zordon for centuries, assisting in numerous battles and maintaining the technology that empowers you through the Morphing Grid.‚Äù

Jamie, fascinated, leaned closer. ‚ÄúSo, you were human once? And now you‚Äôre... this?‚Äù

Alpha nodded, his lights flashing in a pattern that suggested nostalgia. ‚ÄúIndeed. My transformation into an artificial lifeform was necessary to continue my work. Although I have evolved beyond my human form, my core awareness and dedication to the cause remain unchanged. I use my knowledge and experience to support new generations of Rangers like you.‚Äù

Wyatt, ever curious, asked, ‚ÄúAnd this Morphing Grid‚Äîhow does it work? How does it give us these powers?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Morphing Grid,‚Äù Zordon explained, ‚Äúis an energy field that connects all living things. It harnesses the positive energy of the universe, channeling it into your Power Coins. These coins act as conduits, allowing you to tap into the Grid‚Äôs immense power and transform into Power Rangers. Your connection to the Grid is what grants you your abilities, enhances your physical strength, and allows you to morph into your Ranger forms.‚Äù

Kaylee's eyes shone with curiosity and determination. ‚ÄúSo, everything we do as Rangers draws from this Grid? And it‚Äôs connected to all living things?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely,‚Äù Zordon confirmed. ‚ÄúThe Grid is a source of balance and harmony. As Power Rangers, your mission is to protect that balance from those who would seek to disrupt it, like Rita and her minions. Your powers are a reflection of the positive energy you bring to the fight against evil.‚Äù

Peter, feeling the weight of the responsibility once more, nodded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do our best, Zordon. We may not know everything yet, but we‚Äôre ready to learn and fight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour commitment is commendable, Peter,‚Äù Zordon said, his voice filled with a warmth that cut through the seriousness of the moment. ‚ÄúRemember, you are never alone in this. You have each other, and you have the support of Alpha and myself. Together, you will find the strength to face whatever challenges lie ahead.‚Äù

Zordon, for the first time in front of the Rangers, took an unsure pause, his gaze distant as if peering into a long-forgotten past. The subtle hesitation in his voice betrayed a vulnerability he rarely showed. ""Believe it or not,"" he began, choosing his words carefully, ""I too was a Ranger. The leader of Alpha's team.""

The revelation hung in the air, heavy with the weight of history and untold stories. The Rangers stared at Zordon in astonishment, their minds struggling to reconcile this new information with the larger-than-life mentor they had come to know.

Peter was the first to break the silence. ‚ÄúYou were a Ranger? Like us?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Zordon affirmed, a hint of melancholy in his voice. ‚ÄúI led a team of extraordinary individuals, much like yourselves, in the fight against Rita and other dark forces that threatened the universe. We were known as the Omega Rangers. Our mission was to protect and maintain balance across countless worlds.‚Äù

Melody, wide-eyed with curiosity, asked, ‚ÄúWhat happened to your team? And how did you end up like this?‚Äù

Zordon's expression softened as he recounted the tale. ‚ÄúOur final battle against Rita was one of great peril. To prevent her from unleashing a devastating spell that would have engulfed countless galaxies, we had to make a profound sacrifice. My physical form was lost in that confrontation, and I became bound to this tube, existing as pure energy. It was the only way to contain the remnants of Rita's magic and ensure her imprisonment.‚Äù

Alpha 5's lights flickered sympathetically as he added, ‚ÄúZordon‚Äôs sacrifice saved countless lives. But in doing so, he was left in this state. My team and I did everything we could to support him, and in turn, he guided us, just as he guides you now.‚Äù

Kaylee, pulling her athletic bag closer, nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve been fighting this battle for a long time. You gave up everything to stop Rita.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Zordon replied, his voice resonating with a mixture of pride and sorrow. ‚ÄúBut my spirit remains strong, and I continue to fight through you, the new generation of Rangers. The Morphing Grid connects us all, and through it, we share our strength and resolve.‚Äù

Jamie leaned forward, his analytical mind racing with questions. ‚ÄúDoes that mean we could face the same fate? Losing our physical forms?‚Äù

Zordon shook his head gently. ‚ÄúThe circumstances that led to my transformation were unique. The power of the Morphing Grid is meant to protect and empower you, not to harm you. As long as you remain true to your purpose and work as a team, you will find the strength to overcome any adversity without facing such extremes.‚Äù

Wyatt, ever the optimist, managed a reassuring smile. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got your back, Zordon. We‚Äôll do whatever it takes to keep the balance and protect Angel Grove.‚Äù

Peter, feeling a renewed sense of determination, gripped his morpher tightly. ‚ÄúThank you for sharing this with us, Zordon. It means a lot to know that we‚Äôre part of something bigger, something with a legacy. We won‚Äôt let you down.‚Äù

Zordon's expression warmed, the blue glow of his tube reflecting his approval. ‚ÄúI have every confidence in you, Rangers. Together, you will rise to meet the challenges ahead, just as my team did before you. Remember, the power of the Grid is not just in your abilities but in your unity and resolve. Embrace your roles as protectors, and you will forge your own legacy.‚Äù

He paused, allowing his words to sink in. The Rangers stood a bit taller, their resolve steeled by Zordon‚Äôs confidence in them.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Zordon continued, his tone shifting to one of preparation, ‚Äúit is time for you to harness your abilities and work as a cohesive team. Training is essential. Alpha, prepare the holo-chamber.‚Äù

‚ÄúAy-yi-yi! Right away, Zordon!‚Äù Alpha 5 exclaimed, his mechanical limbs whirring into action. He moved to a nearby console, his fingers flying over the controls with practiced precision. ‚ÄúInitializing holo-chamber setup. This will be a perfect scenario to test your skills and teamwork.‚Äù

The command center hummed with energy as Alpha activated the holo-chamber, a large circular space in the far corner of the room. The chamber walls shimmered, then transformed, projecting a lifelike environment that resembled a dense forest clearing. The ground was covered in simulated foliage, and towering trees surrounded the clearing, their branches swaying as if moved by a gentle breeze.

The rangers watched in awe as the holo-chamber took shape before their eyes. The realism of the simulated environment was astonishing, immersing them in a world that felt as tangible as the one outside the command center.

‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù Kaylee breathed, her eyes wide with wonder. ‚ÄúThis is incredible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it is,‚Äù Alpha 5 said with a proud nod. ‚ÄúThe holo-chamber can replicate various terrains and scenarios to provide you with realistic training experiences. Today‚Äôs exercise will focus on basic combat and teamwork strategies. Remember, communication and cooperation are key.‚Äù

Jamie, ever the tactician, studied the environment with a keen eye. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the objective?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe scenario simulates an ambush in a forested area,‚Äù Alpha explained. ‚ÄúYou will encounter holographic Putties, and your task is to neutralize them while protecting simulated civilians trapped in the clearing. Use your powers wisely and work together to ensure the civilian's safety.But never escalate a battle unless the enemy has done as such.‚Äù

Melody clenched her fists, feeling a rush of adrenaline. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs do this.‚Äù

Wyatt adjusted his stance, his eyes scanning the simulated forest with anticipation. ‚ÄúReady when you are, Peter.‚Äù

Peter took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his leadership role settle onto his shoulders. ‚ÄúOkay, team,‚Äù he said, stepping forward. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs show Zordon what we can do. Remember, stay alert, watch each other‚Äôs backs, and keep the civilians safe.‚Äù

Zordon's voice echoed through the command center, filled with encouragement. ‚ÄúThis exercise is not only about your physical abilities but also about your ability to think on your feet and support each other. Trust in your powers without morphing, and in each other, Rangers.‚Äù

The Rangers nodded, their determination palpable. As they stepped into the holo-chamber, the simulated forest closed around them, creating an immersive environment that blurred the lines between reality and training. The trees rustled with unseen movements, and the sounds of distant wildlife filled the air.

Peter led the way, his senses heightened by the anticipation of the challenge. ‚ÄúStay close,‚Äù he instructed, his voice steady. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know when or where they‚Äôll appear.‚Äù

Just then, a rustling sound erupted from the underbrush, followed by the sudden appearance of several holographic Putties. The gray creatures advanced towards the Rangers, their blank faces and lumbering movements instantly recognizable.

‚ÄúHere they come!‚Äù Melody shouted, adopting a defensive stance.

Kaylee moved swiftly, her athletic reflexes kicking in as she prepared to engage the nearest Putty. Jamie flanked Peter, ready to support him in the heat of the simulated battle.

Peter‚Äôs eyes narrowed in focus. ‚ÄúRemember, work together, and we‚Äôll get through this.‚Äù

As the Putties closed in, the Rangers sprang into action, their movements rigid yet synchronized and purposeful. The training exercise had begun, and with it, their journey to becoming a true team of Power Rangers.

She is ""ill"" almost everytime she asks, but then her behaviour contradicts it. I cannot just sit in my room all day while she sleeps until she's ready to wake up to go and begin my day. I work from home so its difficult rather than working outside. I just feel tormented because I'm not a loud person, i dont go out of my way to be noisy i just want to make coffee, make my meals, fix the garden a bit, tidy up etc. She sleeps from like 7-8am until 6-7pm. Idk how to handle it anymore and I start to think I'm a jerk for making noise and not abiding by her demands but I remind myself that I am legit just existing. Id understand again if she worked nightshift or if i was being unreasonably loud, or if i was up late making noise but if she wants a peaceful quiet sleep during the day then maybe sleep when everyone else sleeps??
She also makes quite a bit of noise during the night when i sleep but it doesn't bother me enough to make a reoccurring issue of it. She is existing just like I do during the day, I wish she would offer me the same grace and at least understand that its an unreasonable request, should I tiptoe around the place? I'm fed up.

I just moved into my new apartment and got a big haul from Ikea as I had to furnish my entire apartment. I've used a combination of the Stockholm set with light wood on the already light floor, against the white walls, and a modular J√§ttebo beige couch combination. The 1.5 sit part against the window is around \~100cm.  
  
Now, what type of coffee table and lamps would go well with a room like this?  
  
Any specific shapes that you'd recommend, image references would be amazing as well!

So my non Amex cards are the Quicksilver, Savor, Double Cash, Custom Cash, Discover It, Amazon Chase and the Venmo Card. 

My general spend is roughly:

$600/monthly groceries (mainly at walmart as we only have 1 grocery chain thats far too expensive)  
$300/month on dining/coffee shops  
$150/month on Fuel  
$600/month general spend

Maybe a bit more here or there for specific categories but yearly maybe $2100 in flights and \~1500 in hotels total. nothing major. We do travel international almost yearly so ill have to keep a no AF card around (savor probably or Quicksilver) for when in other countries. 

My thoughts was a sort of mixed setup of Savor/Double/It. Could switch to a entire citi setup/it as well (for the 5% rotating) and then just keep a Cap card for the FTF.

I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn‚Äôt even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that‚Äôs what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou‚Äôs guys their morning pleasantries.

‚ÄúMorning, Brandon‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, Jo‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you today?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the Dream‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dream or someone else‚Äôs?‚Äù

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we‚Äôve had about a thousand times now.

(It‚Äôs too bad.)

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at ‚ÄúLou‚Äôs Plumbing and Heating Co.‚Äù Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

‚ÄúHere comes the straggler!‚Äù says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn‚Äôt say walk. It‚Äôs more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He‚Äôs a dick. He‚Äôs also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He‚Äôs been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

(Lies.)

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHoly shit, you know how to read?‚Äù says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre one to talk, didn‚Äôt your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn‚Äôt even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúLadies please‚Äù

In walks Bill. He‚Äôs our boss and Lou‚Äôs adopted brother.

‚ÄúWhat my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.‚Äù I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

‚ÄúHey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just decommissioning it, we‚Äôre replacing it, Jo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.‚Äù

(They're all burning.)

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you‚Äôll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

‚ÄúFuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh, how big is the contract?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve million‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?‚Äù

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the ‚Äúsupply chain issues‚Äù and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

‚ÄúAre we removing the old boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly, we‚Äôre going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.‚Äù

Whatever you do won‚Äôt work. It will happen again.

‚ÄúWhen can I see the plans?‚Äù

‚ÄúNext week, I‚Äôll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.‚Äù

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we‚Äôve had since 1987. We‚Äôre real cavemen here at Lou‚Äôs. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just so the old bat, who‚Äôs been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She‚Äôs a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

‚ÄúSo Darryl, what do you have for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember Frank?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrank Sinatra?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Farmer Frank, your best buddy.‚Äù

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he‚Äôs my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

‚ÄúOkay, what‚Äôs going on at my buddy‚Äôs place?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn‚Äôt do anything to help his situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.‚Äù

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I‚Äôm more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

‚ÄúHe asked for you, he‚Äôs been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It‚Äôs a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd take Mini Zeke with you. Can‚Äôt leave the boy sheltered all day and I can‚Äôt send him with Turd.‚Äù

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn‚Äôt hear what Darryl said.

(He hears everything.) I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He‚Äôs a wizard. He can look at a system that‚Äôs just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was‚Ä¶

Interesting.

‚ÄúJohnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,‚Äù he said angrily.

‚ÄúGreedy fucker.‚Äù

‚ÄúLou never listens when we tell him anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That‚Äôs an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there‚Äôs never enough heat coming out of them.‚Äù I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, ‚ÄúBecause when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.‚Äù

I chuckled at that.

‚ÄúWhatcha laughing about boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember the old Angel Fire commercials?‚Äù

‚ÄúFucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.‚Äù

We‚Äôre the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

‚ÄúHe gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven‚Äôt changed. Sure they‚Äôve gotten smaller, more ‚Äòefficient‚Äô, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we‚Äôll get the call saying it‚Äôs too cold. Lou‚Äôs pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. ‚ÄúNobody makes a furnace for our weather, it‚Äôs -50 some days, and 30 above the next.‚Äù He‚Äôs right when you‚Äôre dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they‚Äôre selling at the supplier they‚Äôre great. The only issue is that they get too hot‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

‚ÄúSo what do you figure is wrong with Frank‚Äôs? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, Franks a smart old fucker, he‚Äôd have checked that. He only calls if he can‚Äôt figure it out.‚Äù

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

‚ÄúI reckon it‚Äôs the burner box, there‚Äôs a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I‚Äôve only ever changed one in 40 years.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why do you think it‚Äôs that then?‚Äù

‚ÄúCause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that‚Äôs why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.‚Äù

(When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.)

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou‚Äôs part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn‚Äôt work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou‚Äôs. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.‚Äù

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about The Plant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.‚Äù

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check the barn‚Äù

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They‚Äôre big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

‚ÄúThat must be Frank,‚Äù Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

‚ÄúHey, Frank!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, how are you now boys?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood and you?‚Äù Me and Mini said at the same time.

‚ÄúBetter since you two are here.‚Äù

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70‚Äôs, still spry for an old fella.

(Tic toc, tic toc.)

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with the damn thing, I can‚Äôt get it to light, I can‚Äôt get the pump to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck boys‚Äù

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn‚Äôt get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could‚Äôve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.

‚ÄúWell Mini, want to try the thermal reset?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you said there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs the thermal reset.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, is it possible I was wrong and there‚Äôs only one way to cut power to the entire system and it‚Äôs through that reset, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,‚Äù he says as a smirk appears on his face. ‚ÄúSmart ass‚Äù

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he‚Äôs got a manual for this thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. ‚ÄúSo does he have anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúSays he might have it in his attic. He‚Äôll come over if he finds it.‚Äù

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the manual boys.‚Äù

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It‚Äôs said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

(4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.)

‚ÄúThanks, Frank‚Äù

Frank walked back to his tractor

‚ÄúAlright Mini, keep cleaning, I‚Äôm going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be nice, sit in the heat and I‚Äôll stay out here and freeze.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have been a smart ass then.‚Äù

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

(When hell freezes over.)

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

‚ÄúHow the fuck did Johnny change that?‚Äù I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

‚ÄúYea?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found it in the furnace.‚Äù

He paused

‚ÄúUnderneath it was the thermal reset switch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Mini?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt felt warm when I grabbed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFurnace could‚Äôve still been holding some heat.‚Äù I reassured him.

‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôs why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to Frank about it. Don‚Äôt worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It‚Äôs getting late.‚Äù

I‚Äôd started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it‚Äôs just my imagination. It must‚Äôve taken longer to get here than I thought.

‚ÄúFucking Lou should‚Äôve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.‚Äù

Customers don‚Äôt like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

‚ÄúHey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dog?‚Äù He solemnly chuckled

‚ÄúSadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn‚Äôt want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.‚Äù

He laughed sadly again.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help noticing, but the‚Ä¶‚Äù Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my wife. She went missing last year‚Ä¶ the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that again Frank.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, she wasn‚Äôt herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn‚Äôt my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I‚Äôm sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I‚Äôll let you get back to work.‚Äù

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

‚ÄúHuh, must‚Äôve been a longer chat than I thought.‚Äù

Mini was covered in soot.

‚ÄúHey Mini, are you running for office with that face?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He said curtly

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just want this job to be done. I want to go home.‚Äù

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. ‚ÄúDamn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.‚Äù

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. ‚ÄúMini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.‚Äù The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

‚ÄúThat was easy. Got the new one?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

And with that, it was in.

‚ÄúMini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.‚Äù As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

‚ÄúMini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I‚Äôll go fire on the pumps inside.‚Äù

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

(H) (E) (L) (L) (F) (R) (E) (E) (Z) (E) (S) (O) (V) (E) (R)

I walked back out to the furnace, it was pitch black out.

‚ÄúHuh, didn‚Äôt think that walk was very long. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.‚Äù

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking creep up and scare me like that, you‚Äôve done that four times already.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you're going crazy buddy, here I‚Äôll take the bill and tell Frank he‚Äôs all good.‚Äù

(Frank and Beverly sitting in a tree, B-U-R-N-I-N-G.)

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

(And close the door.)

I shouted

‚ÄúFRANK!‚Äù

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

Who am I kidding I‚Äôm a little late every day. I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn‚Äôt even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that‚Äôs what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou‚Äôs guys their morning pleasantries.

‚ÄúMorning, Brandon‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, Jo‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you today?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the Dream‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dream or someone else‚Äôs?‚Äù

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we‚Äôve had about a thousand times now.

(It‚Äôs too bad.)

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at ‚ÄúLou‚Äôs Plumbing and Heating Co.‚Äù Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

‚ÄúHere comes the straggler!‚Äù says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn‚Äôt say walk. It‚Äôs more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He‚Äôs a dick. He‚Äôs also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He‚Äôs been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

(Lies.)

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHoly shit, you know how to read?‚Äù says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre one to talk, didn‚Äôt your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn‚Äôt even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúLadies please‚Äù

In walks Bill. He‚Äôs our boss and Lou‚Äôs adopted brother.

‚ÄúWhat my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.‚Äù I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

‚ÄúHey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just decommissioning it, we‚Äôre replacing it, Jo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.‚Äù

(They're all burning.)

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you‚Äôll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

‚ÄúFuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh, how big is the contract?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve million‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?‚Äù

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the ‚Äúsupply chain issues‚Äù and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

‚ÄúAre we removing the old boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly, we‚Äôre going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.‚Äù

Whatever you do won‚Äôt work. It will happen again.

‚ÄúWhen can I see the plans?‚Äù

‚ÄúNext week, I‚Äôll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.‚Äù

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we‚Äôve had since 1987. We‚Äôre real cavemen here at Lou‚Äôs. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just so the old bat, who‚Äôs been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She‚Äôs a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

‚ÄúSo Darryl, what do you have for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember Frank?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrank Sinatra?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Farmer Frank, your best buddy.‚Äù

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he‚Äôs my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

‚ÄúOkay, what‚Äôs going on at my buddy‚Äôs place?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn‚Äôt do anything to help his situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.‚Äù

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I‚Äôm more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

‚ÄúHe asked for you, he‚Äôs been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It‚Äôs a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd take Mini Zeke with you. Can‚Äôt leave the boy sheltered all day and I can‚Äôt send him with Turd.‚Äù

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn‚Äôt hear what Darryl said.

(He hears everything.) I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He‚Äôs a wizard. He can look at a system that‚Äôs just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was‚Ä¶

Interesting.

‚ÄúJohnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,‚Äù he said angrily.

‚ÄúGreedy fucker.‚Äù

‚ÄúLou never listens when we tell him anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That‚Äôs an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there‚Äôs never enough heat coming out of them.‚Äù I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, ‚ÄúBecause when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.‚Äù

I chuckled at that.

‚ÄúWhatcha laughing about boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember the old Angel Fire commercials?‚Äù

‚ÄúFucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.‚Äù

We‚Äôre the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

‚ÄúHe gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven‚Äôt changed. Sure they‚Äôve gotten smaller, more ‚Äòefficient‚Äô, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we‚Äôll get the call saying it‚Äôs too cold. Lou‚Äôs pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. ‚ÄúNobody makes a furnace for our weather, it‚Äôs -50 some days, and 30 above the next.‚Äù He‚Äôs right when you‚Äôre dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they‚Äôre selling at the supplier they‚Äôre great. The only issue is that they get too hot‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

‚ÄúSo what do you figure is wrong with Frank‚Äôs? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, Franks a smart old fucker, he‚Äôd have checked that. He only calls if he can‚Äôt figure it out.‚Äù

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

‚ÄúI reckon it‚Äôs the burner box, there‚Äôs a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I‚Äôve only ever changed one in 40 years.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why do you think it‚Äôs that then?‚Äù

‚ÄúCause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that‚Äôs why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.‚Äù

(When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.)

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou‚Äôs part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn‚Äôt work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou‚Äôs. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.‚Äù

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about The Plant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.‚Äù

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check the barn‚Äù

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They‚Äôre big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

‚ÄúThat must be Frank,‚Äù Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

‚ÄúHey, Frank!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, how are you now boys?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood and you?‚Äù Me and Mini said at the same time.

‚ÄúBetter since you two are here.‚Äù

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70‚Äôs, still spry for an old fella.

(Tic toc, tic toc.)

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with the damn thing, I can‚Äôt get it to light, I can‚Äôt get the pump to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck boys‚Äù

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn‚Äôt get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could‚Äôve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.

‚ÄúWell Mini, want to try the thermal reset?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you said there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs the thermal reset.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, is it possible I was wrong and there‚Äôs only one way to cut power to the entire system and it‚Äôs through that reset, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,‚Äù he says as a smirk appears on his face. ‚ÄúSmart ass‚Äù

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he‚Äôs got a manual for this thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. ‚ÄúSo does he have anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúSays he might have it in his attic. He‚Äôll come over if he finds it.‚Äù

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the manual boys.‚Äù

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It‚Äôs said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

(4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.)

‚ÄúThanks, Frank‚Äù

Frank walked back to his tractor

‚ÄúAlright Mini, keep cleaning, I‚Äôm going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be nice, sit in the heat and I‚Äôll stay out here and freeze.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have been a smart ass then.‚Äù

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

(When hell freezes over.)

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

‚ÄúHow the fuck did Johnny change that?‚Äù I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

‚ÄúYea?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found it in the furnace.‚Äù

He paused

‚ÄúUnderneath it was the thermal reset switch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Mini?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt felt warm when I grabbed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFurnace could‚Äôve still been holding some heat.‚Äù I reassured him.

‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôs why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to Frank about it. Don‚Äôt worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It‚Äôs getting late.‚Äù

I‚Äôd started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it‚Äôs just my imagination. It must‚Äôve taken longer to get here than I thought.

‚ÄúFucking Lou should‚Äôve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.‚Äù

Customers don‚Äôt like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

‚ÄúHey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dog?‚Äù He solemnly chuckled

‚ÄúSadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn‚Äôt want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.‚Äù

He laughed sadly again.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help noticing, but the‚Ä¶‚Äù Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my wife. She went missing last year‚Ä¶ the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that again Frank.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, she wasn‚Äôt herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn‚Äôt my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I‚Äôm sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I‚Äôll let you get back to work.‚Äù

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

‚ÄúHuh, must‚Äôve been a longer chat than I thought.‚Äù

Mini was covered in soot.

‚ÄúHey Mini, are you running for office with that face?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He said curtly

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just want this job to be done. I want to go home.‚Äù

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. ‚ÄúDamn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.‚Äù

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. ‚ÄúMini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.‚Äù The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

‚ÄúThat was easy. Got the new one?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

And with that, it was in.

‚ÄúMini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.‚Äù As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

‚ÄúMini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I‚Äôll go fire on the pumps inside.‚Äù

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

(H) (E) (L) (L) (F) (R) (E) (E) (Z) (E) (S) (O) (V) (E) (R)

I walked back out to the furnace, it was pitch black out.

‚ÄúHuh, didn‚Äôt think that walk was very long. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.‚Äù

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking creep up and scare me like that, you‚Äôve done that four times already.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you're going crazy buddy, here I‚Äôll take the bill and tell Frank he‚Äôs all good.‚Äù

(Frank and Beverly sitting in a tree, B-U-R-N-I-N-G.)

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

(And close the door.)

I shouted

‚ÄúFRANK!‚Äù

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

1l2m7ct,https://i.redd.it/85kfk6q8tr4f1.jpeg,"I got fired, thank God.","In September of 2024, I moved back across the country to the small town where I went to college. The only way I was able to do this was because a local cafe was willing to hire me remotely. The owner called me from 2000 miles away and guaranteed me employment after the phone interview. At the time I was overjoyed, this was the lifeline I needed to escape my living situation. It didn‚Äôt even occur to me that their desperation for employees was a red flag. With a job guaranteed, I bit the financial bullet and packed my bags. 

My optimism crashed as soon as the nature of the establishment became clear. There were some health code violations. Major ones. The management had just recently reshuffled, and it was clear that things were messy from top to bottom. The majority of employees were aged 18-23. They were chronically understaffed, with an extremely high turnover rate.

Among other things:
- Iced coffee is stored in the iced coffee bucket. This is a non airtight vat that is left at room temperature that leftover hot coffee is dumped into to sit in 24/7. Pitchers are filled from the perpetual bacterial stew and put into the refrigerator as needed, which is what gets poured to serve to customers. The bucket used to not be cleaned for months at a time, and is now emptied out every couple of weeks.
- The espresso machines and wands have never been properly cleaned. This is because not a single person in the establishment knows how to clean them. There is no comprehensive training on how to care for the machines. ‚ÄúBackwashing‚Äù is performed daily and improperly. 
- The pitchers that hold lemonade, cold brew, iced teas, etc used to not be cleaned for unknown amounts of time. They would grow moldly, with visible detritus floating in them, and customers would be served this. Managers dismissed my concerns as ‚Äúthat's just what the tea looks like.‚Äù I'm pretty sure white floating spores and black mold rimming the spouts aren't normal. 

Last Wednesday, 20 minutes before an interview at a local restaurant, I was called and informed that I was fired. I was told not to show up to work that day. There was no advance notice, no 3-strike disciplinary actions taken against me like they claim will happen before you are terminated. Two weeks ago, I was told by a manager that I was not in danger of being written up, let alone fired. The call lasted five minutes because my interview was 15 minutes away. I hung up and cried tears of joy. 

This job sucked the soul out of me. Working full-time for them rendered me unable to take care of myself on a basic level outside of work. Less than an hour after I got fired, I had a new job and a start date. I didn't even have to quit and put in an extra 2 weeks out of politeness. I'm out, I'm free. I can move on with my life and find joy in working for a place where the physical and mental toll doesnt kill me slowly.

There‚Äôs so much more I can say about the unprofessionalism, the favoritism, the isolation. But I would like to end on a positive note. If it weren‚Äôt for the kindness of my favorite regulars, who took the time to get to know me over the 9 months of my working there, I wouldn‚Äôt have made it through. I made real friends out of customers, and I‚Äôm so grateful for that. Thanks for reading.

I am a short 159cm, 25yo girl so 15kg was a big change in my appearance. The different food, no walking, long periods of unemployment changed me and it was so hard for me to accept myself like that. I tried supplements, eating healthy, eating less, got a job where i walk a lot and managed to get to 70kg (154p). 

Berberine helped me the most and i took it for like 2 months around 1500mg. Suddenly i started getting bruises all over me. Even the smallest pinch would turn into a big black bruise. Around 2 weeks ago i stopped taking berberine and the bruises stopped (im also more careful now). The issue is that in these 2 weeks i have only dropped 1kg and im eating like 2 times a day and nothing after 5PM till 10 AM in the next morning. I do more that 13k steps a day, i only drink 1 coffee (with milk and very little caramel creamer), maybe 1-2 fruits and 1 super small meal. Im sure im on a calorie deficit at this point but without berberine i barely lose weight. 

Does anyone have an opinion on this? Should I continue berberine and ignore the bruises, lower the dosage? Idk man im getting tired of surviving with 1 coffee and 2 corns",10,1748981826.0,Supplements,11,0.86,False
1l2m5pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/1l2m5pr/suggestions_for_a_nitro_latte_coffee_drink_no/,"Suggestions for a nitro latte coffee drink (no mocha), low added sugar (or artificial sweetener)","I previously enjoyed Monster Energy's Java Nitro Cold Brew Latte; it had a bit too much artificial sweetener taste for me, but I liked the creaminess and the foamy nitro head. Unfortunately, Monster discontinued this drink. I recently tried La Colombe Triple Draft Latte; I liked it, except it isn't nitro, and I really like a nitro latte.  Things I liked about the Colombe: it tasted real, not artificial. I liked the size of the can; the bigger the better, I don't like those tiny little cans. I also like that it has only only 5 g of added sugar.

Ideally:

Natural ingredients 
Low added sugar
Nitro
Latte
Large can

Not looking for:
High sugar
Mocha (not latte)
If it does have artificial sweeteners, hopefully it doesn't have an exaggerated artificial taste.

Not here to toss out a lazy ‚Äúhey‚Äù and disappear after three texts. I‚Äôm actually hoping to find someone I genuinely vibe with, something real, effortless, consistent. The kind of connection that feels like a soft place to land after a chaotic day.
I‚Äôm 19.Bit of an old soul, classic films are my thing (yes, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is peak cinema). I get lost in emotional story-based games, the kind that leave you wrecked in the best way. I write too ,poetry, short stories,mostly when my thoughts get loud.
I love books, learning new languages (currently deep into Japanese and German), and getting to know different cultures. I‚Äôd pick a sunrise in the mountains over a loud night at a club any day. Quiet coffee mornings, solo travel, long walks with no destination, that‚Äôs more my pace.My life‚Äôs kinda wild right now, I run a marketing agency, work remotely with a US-based company, and also manage an NGO and school for kids who deserve a better shot at life. So yeah, it gets busy. But everything I do, I do with heart.

What I‚Äôm hoping to find:
Someone I can build a long-term connection with. Someone to talk about life, music, weird dreams, or send voice notes at 2AM. Deep talks or silly memes,I‚Äôm down for both. I‚Äôm honest, respectful, and not here to waste time or play games.

If you‚Äôre someone who values meaningful convos and slow-burn connections, just tell me your age and gender when you reach out. That‚Äôs all.Let‚Äôs see where it goes. Who knows‚Äîthis might be something worth keeping.",1,1748981591.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
