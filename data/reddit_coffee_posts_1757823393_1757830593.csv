The barista laughed, the entire café laughed, and I just stood there holding my dignity in one hand and a plain latte in the other.

Whether it's deciding the business structure to complying with contracts and compliances.

You need strong agreements and good contract management as your startup scales.

Save this post for your reference and a reminder.

- Not setting up the entity formally as a business.

- Overlooking important organizational documents. 
(say for eg, you set up an agency as an LLC But doesn't maintain and operate an Operating Agreement. When a dispute arises between partners there's no protocol to dissolve it. 

- Ignoring non-compete clauses in founders and employee agreements.
(if a tech founder hires a developer not inquiring about his prior non-compete clause, it can lead to employment conflicts.)

- Overlooking strong employment/options agreements.
(if a SaaS company offers stock options without clear agreements can lead to disputes at time of buyouts.)

- Skipping hiring a paralegal/lawyer and go with templates and ChatGPT advice. 
(If a local coffee shop uses an online lease template they won't realize it lacks location specific clauses ultimately leading to sudden eviction.)

- Skipping written agreements and depending solely on verbal commitments
(devil is surely laughing in the background)...

- Neglecting IP. 
(say you are a coffee brand owner with a distinct logo and branding but doesn't go for trademark & another cafe opens up with a copied branding causing customer confusion. Don't do that please.)

- Overlooking online business regulations (let's say an e-commerce platform fails to have a GDPR compliant privacy. This can result in hefty fines from Europe.)

- Failing to secure proper license and permits 

(if an online streaming service doesn't secure appropriate licenses for broadcasting content in certain regions. This can lead to legal actions from local authorities.)

- Mixing customer contracts and warranties
(assume an online electronic store doesn't offer clear warranty terms. This can lead to backlash when products malfunction.)


I hope this guide helps you as a budding and growing founder.

1ngjic6,https://www.reddit.com/r/companysetupbh/comments/1ngjic6/what_happens_if_i_dont_renew_my_commercial/,What Happens If I Don't Renew My Commercial Registration on Time in Bahrain?,"What Happens If I Don't Renew My Commercial Registration on Time in Bahrain?\
\
Alt text: Business professionals collaborating in a modern boardroom. in the Diplomatic Area taught me a lesson I now share with every entrepreneur—never, ever let your commercial registration (CR) lapse. If you’re thinking of Bahrain company formation or already running a business from the Seef District or Bahrain Bay, you’ll want to know exactly what missing your CR renewal deadline means in 2025.*\
The Bahrain Business Environment: 2025 Realities and Beyond\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.). The Economic Development Board (EDB) reports over 1,300 new commercial registrations in Q1 2025 alone, with fintech, logistics, and sustainability sectors leading the charge (Reuters).\
\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s regulatory bodies have made major strides in digitalization. The Sijilat portal now processes typical CR renewals in less than 24 hours (unless there are compliance flags).\
\
Unlike the UAE’s more expensive corporate set-up or Saudi Arabia’s more rigid sponsorship models, Bahrain strikes a unique balance—affordable fees, 100% foreign ownership in many sectors, strong support for SMEs, and flexible work permit pathways. (I’ll never forget my first majlis with Bahraini partners: coffee, frank talk, and an insistence on following the rules—always.)\
For those weighing company formation in Bahrain, a timely CR renewal isn’t just a box to tick—it’s the backbone of your legal existence, your ability to invoice, import, hire, and even access banking.\
\
What Is a Commercial Registration (CR) and Why Is It So Important?\
Defining the CR\
A Commercial Registration (CR) is your company’s legal identity, issued and maintained by the MOICT. Think of it as your corporate passport—it lets your business operate, sign contracts, open bank accounts, and enroll staff with LMRA. Every business, from WLLs and SPCs to branches and free zone entities, needs a valid CR.\
If you’re still deciding on your business structure, review these entity types before moving forward—entity choice affects your renewal process.\
\
Key Functions Tied to Your CR\
\
License validity and renewal\
Hiring and LMRA work permits\
Access to Tamkeen support\
Bank account operations\
Customs and VAT registration\
\
Mess this up? The ripple effect can halt your operations overnight.\
\
What Actually Happens If You Miss Your CR Renewal Deadline?\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
\
\
The MOICT currently charges BHD 100 for the first month of delay after expiry, escalating to BHD 250 after 60 days. (Recent update: Fines doubled in January 2025 to discourage habitual late renewals.)\
\
\
Over 100 days late? The MOICT may initiate company suspension procedures and inform Tamkeen and LMRA, effectively blocking all staff renewals and new hires.\
\
\
You’ll also face additional compliance scrutiny—my own error led to a random audit request from Sijilat, which was not fun during Ramadan hours!\
Risk of Blacklisting\
\
Companies late by 6+ months are at risk of being blacklisted—which, unlike in the UAE, can affect even shareholder personal travel and new company formation for up to three years.\
\
Suspension and Forced De-Registration\
\
If your CR is not renewed after 12 months, the business will be forcibly struck off by the MOICT, and all assets may be seized or liquidated.\
\
\
Importantly, once your business is struck off, you’ll face a bureaucratic mountain to restart—a much bigger headache than the original lapse.\
\
\
Practical Example: How a Missed Renewal Nearly Cost Me a Project in Bahrain Bay\
A direct story. My consulting firm’s CR renewal window coincided with a major government tender in Bahrain Bay. I missed the reminder email, and suddenly my client payment was frozen by our bank. The delay cost me a week and nearly the project. The worst part? Fixing it (rushing to the MOICT office in Diplomatic Area at 7:30 AM, skipping my usual coffee stop) taught me to always set three digital calendar reminders, not just one.\
\
The Cost of Not Renewing: Breakdown for 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs..\
- Late Penalty (2025):\
BHD 100 (first month), increasing to BHD 250 (after 2 months), PLUS required compliance audit processing fees (BHD 50–100 per occurrence)\
- Indirect Costs:\
Bank freezes, legal consultation fees (average BHD 30–75 per hour), lost client trust, and missed LMRA renewals (BHD 150-200 per rejected visa)\
A friend had to pay BHD 1,200 in fines—all because his accountant missed the renewal by four months. (Lesson: Always check your own Sijilat dashboard, even if you outsource accounting—good support here.)\
\
Step-by-Step: Avoiding Late Renewal Fines and Downtime\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.:\
8:00–9:00 AM, MOICT Diplomatic Area (lobby queue shortest, staff most responsive)\
* Avoid Seef Mall Service Center at noon—queues are brutal post-lunch and after prayer times.\
4. Use Professional Services (If Practical)\
\
For multi-shareholder structures, work with a specialist for document collection and digital filing.\
If in a free zone, check special benefits here—some offer concierge renewal services.\
\
5. Insider Tip: Fast-Track Support\
\
When urgent, use Sijilat’s “Express Renewal” button and follow up with a direct call to their hotline (+973 1756 8888).\
Building rapport with the MOICT staff (bring coffee!) can help nudge your file along—Bahraini business culture puts weight on personal relationships.\
\
\
Compliance Requirements: Your To-Do List for Every Renewal\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation..*\
\
Companies with 100% foreign ownership must now show up-to-date beneficial owner disclosures, in line with global AML standards (details here).\
VAT compliance audits are randomly enforced during the renewal process.\
The new “digital signature” protocol on Sijilat is mandatory for filings—set up your eKey in advance.\
\
Checklist of Post-Formation Requirements\
\
Updated Memorandum and Articles (if amended)\
Valid LMRA and Municipality licenses\
Copy of latest lease or tenancy contract (attested if in a free zone)\
Renewal payment receipt (BHD 50–350, check latest cost grid)\
\
For peace of mind, many founders now opt for outsourced compliance support.\
\
Business Structures: Renewal Nuances and Ownership Options\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. handle renewals through their own admin offices, making life easier for busy owners.\
Want 100% foreign ownership? Review your options and understand the renewal protocols—especially for regulated industries.\
Local Sponsorship: When and Why It Matters\
If your company uses a local sponsor, always check the fine print. Some sponsorship contracts require your sponsor to approve or even initiate the renewal—delays here can mean double the late fees.\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: Compliance Meets Coffee\
I’ll admit—Bahrain’s business culture mixes formal regulation with deeply personal touches. In-person renewal at the MOICT often involves a quick majlis-style chat in the waiting area. Traditional coffee is still offered, especially during Ramadan. Don’t rush it. Build a relationship, ask about their family, and you may find your paperwork processed lightning-fast.\
A quick tangent: Did you know Bahrain Bay’s business district holds an annual “compliance networking suhoor” during Ramadan? It’s the perfect place to resolve sticky renewal issues over qahwa and dates—proof that in Bahrain, relationships still open doors.\
\
Insider’s Perspective: UAE and Saudi Comparison\
Unlike the UAE, where missing a license renewal can quietly slide for weeks, Bahrain’s systems are interconnected (Sijilat, LMRA, Tamkeen, banks). The negative impact is felt everywhere, fast. Saudi Arabia’s approach is stricter still, often requiring a “re-registration” process with higher penalties. Bahrain’s transparent fee structure, fast-track government support, and digitized workflow give it a real competitive edge for entrepreneurs.\
\
Best Resources & Service Providers: My Tested Recommendations\
\
For document prep and reminders:\
Keylink Bahrain—their compliance team is responsive, affordable, and Bahrain-savvy.\
For high-value, time-poor founders:\
  Use the Sijilat “authorized representative” feature and engage a local pro. The right consultant can prevent costly misses.\
For complex, multi-national structures:\
  Tap accounting and compliance experts who specialize in cross-border renewals and EDB approvals.\
\
\
Common Mistake: Underestimating the Renewal Timeline\
The most frequent error? Waiting until the “last week” of CR validity. Don’t. A sudden document request or EDB approval can push you past the deadline. Always start renewal prep at least 30 days in advance—especially for complex or foreign-owned entities.\
My personal workaround? I keep a “renewal check” hour every month, synced to my calendar, so I never depend solely on automated reminders.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Commercial Registration Renewal\
1. Can I operate while my CR is expired but renewal is in process?\
No. Once your CR is marked expired in Sijilat, you are prohibited from officially operating, billing, or issuing new LMRA work permits. Limited “processing grace” is offered only if you submit renewal documents before expiry, but penalties may still apply. For detail-specific guidance, refer to the MOICT renewal page.\
\
2. What’s the fastest way to renew my CR if I’m overdue?\
Use the Sijilat “Express Renewal” function and follow up directly at the MOICT main branch early in the morning. Have all documents pre-scanned and payment ready. Consider hiring pro assistance, especially if penalties have accrued or compliance issues are flagged.\
\
3. Are there exceptions or waivers for late renewal fees?\
In rare cases (natural disasters, government-mandated closures), you can apply for a penalty waiver, but documented proof is required. Contact MOICT or your preferred accounting support team for help preparing the case.\
\
4. Is there a way to automate CR renewals?\
While full automation isn’t possible, you can assign authorized representatives in Sijilat and use third-party reminder services. Some free zones and professional service providers offer bundled renewal management, which can be integrated into your annual compliance package.\
\
5. Where can I find the most up-to-date information on Bahrain registration and compliance?\
Bookmark Bahrain’s official portal, plus Gulf News Bahrain, Reuters, and Forbes Business for business environment trends. For practical, on-the-ground advice and fee estimates, Keylink’s resources are kept current and are entrepreneur-focused.\
\
Final Words\
Renewing your commercial registration on time in Bahrain is not just a regulatory hoop—it’s the lifeline of your business. The cost of inaction far outweighs the small effort to stay compliant. My best advice? Build strong local relationships, start early, and always, always double-check your Sijilat dashboard—especially during Ramadan or holiday periods. (And never turn down a cup of Bahraini coffee while you’re at it.)\

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Heyoo Reddit 👋✨

So I figured I’d give this a shot because why not? Life’s way more fun when you’ve got cool people to chat with, right? 🥳 I’m basically on the lookout for someone  to laugh with, share random memes 🐸📸, rant about daily chaos 😅, and maybe even discover some common hobbies (or weird ones 👀).

About me:
	•	Certified introvert who sometimes pretends to be social 🦥
	•	Coffee addict ☕ + night owl 🌙 = questionable sleep schedule 🛌
	•	Love cooking 🍳, baking 🍪, and pretending my food looks like Pinterest pictures (spoiler: it does not 😂)
	•	Huge fan of long walks, especially when I can pretend I’m the main character in some dramatic indie film 🎶🌲
	•	Low-key gym rat 💪 but also 100% down for pizza at midnight 🍕✨

What I’m hoping for:
	•	Chill convos about literally anything 🛸
	•	Swapping music recs 🎧
	•	Gaming buddies? (I’m not great but I try 😅🎮)
	•	People who don’t mind my occasional “life update” voice notes that sound like podcast episodes 🎙️

If you’re the type of person who sends way too many emojis 🙋‍♀️, loves random deep talks at 2 AM 🌌, or just wants a new pal to share memes with… hit me up! 💌

Anyway, if you’ve made it this far, congrats 🏆 you now know more about me than half the people in my real life 😂 Let’s be friends? 💜",2,1757829429.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1ngj9y3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ngj9y3/aita_for_asking_to_keep_someone_posted_on_plans/,AITA for asking to keep someone posted on plans,"I had been seeing a guy casually- grabbing coffee or taking a walk about once a month- and we had a date planned during the week and also a hike planned for that weekend.  It was uncommon to see each other twice in a week, but I was looking forward to it.  I started to get sick and told him I was still up for hanging out during the week if he was, but wanted to let him know I was under the weather and not as talkative/energetic.  

He said it was fine, we saw each other and had a great time, and I expressed how seeing him really made my day and brightened my mood when I had been feeling unwell.  

We talked about our hike, and I said I didn’t know yet if I’d be well enough for something more active.  He said he understood and could tell I was feeling pretty rough.  I said I had a prescription to fill the next day (I had been to the doctor earlier), and that it might help by the time of our hike, I just didn’t know yet.   I asked if I could keep him posted because I know he is sensitive about feeling his time is t valued and didn’t want to cancel on him last minute if I didn’t get better. He said that was no problem. 

So the next evening I got medication and was feeling exponentially better.  I texted him and explained that I was improving and was able to get out and go on a walk with some friends today and would be able to still get together for our hike.  He told me he already made other plans because he didn’t think I’d be better so soon.  I was a bit sad, but figured it was a miscommunication and told him it was okay and I was excited to hang out another time.  

Historically, he has been kinda flaky and inconsistent.  He’d say he wanted to see me and then would disappear for a week.  I often initiate plans.  In the past he has cancelled last minute or been very late.  It hasn’t bothered me too much as I don’t see this as a serious connection.  He told me in the past he wasn’t looking for a relationship (I had one time wanted a relationship with him), so I filed him into the “casual fun” category and moved forward accordingly.  If I want deeper, consistent connection, I have other people in my life for that.  

I later shared that I’d love to get together another time to hike.  He told me he was thrown off by me getting better suddenly the other day and felt like I was hot and cold and in and out of his life.  He told me he was reluctant to see me again because he protects his peace and feels I don’t value his time. 

I was very confused and figured something really must have gotten lost in our communication.  We talked and I explained that I felt misunderstood because I had really wanted to see him and had asked to check in before the hike precisely because I had wanted to be mindful of his time- I hadn’t wanted to cancel last minute in the event that I had been still feeling unwell. 

He said he made other plans because he “doesn’t wait around for people.”  I offered that I would have been happy to make different plans, and he told me I was expecting him to read my mind.  Then he said something like, “it’s fine but maybe we both need to work on our communication.”  This rubbed me the wrong way as I don’t know how I could have been clearer, and he had told me he was okay playing things by ear. 

I expressed that I had been very flexible with his own inconsistency and felt judged when I *one time* clearly asked for some flexibility for being sick, which I couldn’t help.  He told me I was dragging up the past unfairly.  

I then asked him if he still wanted to hike and he said he needed to think about it and he’d let me know.  I pointed out that this was precisely what I had asked that started this entire conflict.  He said it was different when I did it.  I said I didn’t think it was.  He then told me that I don’t care about him or understand him at all and that we should just cancel since I think it’s unfair and he wants to be fair.  

I left the whole thing feeling SO blindsided.  I’m confused why this person, who I saw maybe a couple hours a month, who previously insisted he didn’t want a relationship, who has been incredibly flaky, was so offended in what I considered to be a very benign and normal social interaction.  I have no idea why this upset him so much, what triggered him, or how he would have liked me to have acted when I got sick.  I feel so disoriented, like I have no understanding of the mechanics of this interaction.

Like many of you here, we've spent way too many nights and weekends wrestling with a dozen different APIs, trying to stitch together reliable data for our trading models. One API for real-time prices, another for options, a sketchy one for sentiment, and then hours of cleaning it all up before an LLM can even touch it.

It's a pain. And it’s a huge time sink that gets in the way of what we actually want to do: build and test new strategies.

That's why we built PluseFin MCP Server. Our goal was to create the single, clean tools for AI  we always wished we had. One that's designed from the ground up for modern AI and LLM-powered trading.

We're pretty excited about it and wanted to give you guys a first look.

So, what is it?

It's an AI-first financial data server. You hit our API, and you get everything you need to power your trading agents, without the usual headaches.

Here's what we focused on:

* The ""It Just Works"" Part (Seriously, like 5 mins): We obsessed over making the tool simple. The idea is you can go from zero to pulling meaningful data into your system in the time it takes to brew a coffee. Less boilerplate, more alpha.
* Built for AI, Not Just Bolted On: This isn't just another data endpoint with ""AI"" slapped on it. It’s designed to feed models (especially LLMs) the structured data they need. Think less time spent on preprocessing, more time on generating signals.
* All The tools, One MCP: We got tired of juggling subscriptions. We’ve bundled in the stuff that matters:
   * Real-time & historical market data
   * ML-powered predictive analytics we've built in
   * Full options chain data (Greeks, IV, the works)
   * Who's actually moving the market? (13F filings, insider trades, major shareholders)
   * Market sentiment and economic data (from FRED, etc.)

And yeah, we have a free tier.

We're building this for developers and quants like us who want to push the boundaries of AI in finance. We're just getting started and would love to hear your thoughts, gut reactions, or what features you'd kill for.

We'll be sharing more technical details and docs soon.

Stay in the loop

and

Cheers,

The PluseFin Team

Here is Practical explanation about after life, and purpose of life - Cabuka","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Newly engaged, smiling ear to ear with Scott–my brother–holding her hand like they were 13. I hadn’t ever seen my brother so comfortable, except for when he was behind a camera, and I was glad to see him at ease. He had asked me to take pictures for them, a task I was surprised he trusted me with. I had gotten lost in the process as I posed them various ways. The composition of the open field was perfect and I had never worked with better lighting. Nothing could have made it better, if only Scott could lay off the directing for half an hour. 

**Scott:** “What’s the ISO at? You’ve got the foreground, right? Make sure you get her eyes, Reagan.” 

I grudgingly mumbled my responses. Obviously I got the foreground, the camera was stuck into the grass for half the shots, and my ISO was fine for the light we had. He was right though, I had lost Sarah’s eyes a bit in the last shot. Regardless, he had been a touch too involved in the process and I started to get a little annoyed. After another comment about how I needed the reflector, I cut him off abruptly.

**Reagan**: “I fucking got it, just lay off,”

 He looked a bit taken aback, and I immediately felt bad. He was just trying to help, I knew that. Sarah’s smile had faltered at my outburst, and she clutched a little at Scott's arm. I hadn't thought my tone was that bad, but it had made her uncomfortable and I regretted that even more. 

My regret only deepened as I sat in that memory, and the empty road ahead gave me no comfort. The radio buzzed as I checked my rearview. Nothing but a bare highway behind me. Suddenly overwhelmed by the silence and the seriousness of what I was doing, I fiddled with the knob to the radio until I hit a station, desperate for some noise.

**Radio**: “Police are asking for the public's help in locating a missing woman. Twenty eight year old Sarah Beck Paulgaard was last seen on October thirty first near Maple Street. She is described as five-foot-seven, one-hundred-forty pounds, brown hair and brown eyes. Last seen wearing blue jeans and a purple and blue sweater. If anyone has any information about this woman it is asked you contact the sheriffs office immediately,”

I toyed with the map on the seat next to me while the reality set in of what I was doing. My chest constricted slightly and my breath got short. 

Was I really going out to the middle of nowhere to find my brother's fiancé? She had gone missing about three days ago, disappearing off the face of the earth without a word. We filed a missing persons report and the police took it, but to my knowledge they never actually made any effort to work on the case itself. All they do is give press releases, as if that would be enough to find her. I’ll never forget the look on my brother's face, the devastation and pain in his eyes when they turned him down right then and there. “You’re lacking in evidence to get a search party out there. She’s a young woman about to get married, maybe she got cold feet.” In all honesty, I'm not surprised the sheriff's county would say that.

 As the sun started to set and the big, dark clouds closed in, the chill began to seep into my truck. Not even my heater couldn’t save me from the cold. It’s a cheap truck anyway, I got it this way from my dads business buddy, should've known better.

Turning onto the dirt road I noticed wet flakes of snow start to fall on my truck, something I was hoping wouldn't happen while I was out. Hopefully it wouldn't be long, I hadn’t really thought this through. While I continued driving, I checked my glove compartment for my camcorder. Thankfully it was still there. Worst case scenario I would need some way to record evidence, and it also kind of grounded me. It spoke to me like a challenge, daring me to find something. That camcorder was a gift to me from my big brother, he knew how much I wanted to get into photography and documentary. Something I always admired was how he always put anyone else before him. It showed how confident he was, how much he wanted to help and make others happy, something I don’t get the chance to do. Tonight is my chance, whether he likes it or not.

I saw that there was an old fence in the distance and trees that started to embrace the landscape. I knew I was getting closer, and my heart started to sink into my chest. I had no way of knowing if she was here, it was just a matter of hoping against reason that she would go this far on her own, back to the place she spoke of so poorly before.

There on the dirt road was the same fence I came across not too long ago. The fence was a scarred white that was long overdue for a repaint. It seemed like no one lived here anymore.

Slowly I rolled down the road. Old buildings in similar condition to the fence loomed ahead. I could discern a farmhouse, complete with two stories and a front porch, and a barn which I could only imagine was red at some point. I was kind of shocked they hadn't collapsed yet.

I parked my truck next to a mailbox labeled “Paulgaard”. It was somewhat rusted and weathered, full of mail and slightly leaned over, but the brass nameplate still shone enough to catch my eye.

I grabbed my camera and walked down towards the abandoned house, the gravel crunching beneath my boots and the wet snow piling on my shoulders. The gentle wisps of wind flowing through the uncut grass in the farm fields and the crows cawing up ahead at the porch gave me chills. It made me feel too alone. Kind of ironic given the circumstance. I found it hard to imagine Sarah going out here by choice.

I reached the barn after some time. I don’t know why I didn’t park any closer, but it was too late for that now. I noticed there was a lock on the barn's doors and it looked new, too new for the state of the barn. Standing there puzzled, I had a feeling, a burning desire to know what was there. Leaning down, I look under the door. There was at least a two inch gap under the barn doors that would seem promising, but it was no use, there was nothing but darkness. As I got up and turned around I made my way to the house a little way down the dirt road. There was now a thin layer of snow on the ground, the sky was darker and the wind had picked up. I slowly opened the door, seeing that the inside of the home was much more maintained and cleanly than the outside. As I made my way into the living room, there were photos of a nice looking family of four all in nice red sweaters. A father, mother, son and a daughter, all with brown hair. My eyes wandered to the other paintings of their farm, the same barn but with a fresh coat of paint and some sort of tractor they probably had lying around the property somewhere. I released a stale breath, realizing I should document what I was looking at in case I actually found some solid evidence for where Sarah went. Reaching in my coat pocket it was gone.

**Reagan**: “Shit.”

I slowly backed out of the front door, closing it softly before jogging back to the barn. As I approached I was met with my camcorder, thank god. I could almost imagine the look on my brother’s face if I had lost it. I fussed over it, brushing the dust off of it. I glanced up and jumped. The last thing I had expected to see was another person. Someone was walking back from an old church that was on the property. It was hidden by the house, no kidding I hadn’t seen it. My heart sank a bit. Was I going to get in shit for snooping? 

Making out the figure as they got closer, it was an old man who looked about to be in his late sixties, wearing a red button up and faded blue jeans. He waved at me before calling out.

Old Man: “You lost son? What's that camera for huh, yousah news reporter tryna buy my property?” 

He laughed letting out that raspy noise that sounds like he’s got phlegm in his throat.

**Reagan**: “No sir, I was uh, looking for my brother's fiancé. She went missing not so long ago,”  

His smile didn’t fade but his demeanor changed, his posture getting stiffer.

**Old Man**:  “Oh really. What’s her name? Just in case I see this lady by any chance, you never know,” 

He scratched his chin as he looked at me, glancing at my camcorder and then back at my face.

**Reagan**: “Her name is Sarah, brown hair, about yay tall,” 

He looked down at the frosty gravel at his feet, adjusting his cap as he thought. The wind picked up around us slightly as the silence got deeper. I’m sure I saw him glancing at me beneath his brim. Why was that such a hard question to answer? Just say no at this point. Maybe I had made him uncomfortable, that was a lot of information to just dump on a person. I had a tendency to do that when I was anxious, just spill my guts until someone told me to shut up. I was just about to fill the awkward silence with more rambling,  but he finally spoke.

**Old Man**:  “y’know I don’t think it’s a good idea to be talking about it out here. It’s getting cold out son, come on inside. Dinner’s going to be done soon,”

**Reagan**: “Oh no, I oughta get going, I got a heater in my truck so don’t worry about me. I’m sorry for coming onto your property, I just didn’t think someone lived here.”

**Old Man**:  “No, I insist. The old lady would be disappointed with me if I turned a young man like you away into the cold. Please, join my family for dinner. We’ll be having some nice barbecued brisket and vegetables with some milk that was produced right here on this farm!”

I don’t want to protest with him any further, I’m already trespassing and he’s kind enough to invite me inside his home. As I followed he stayed quiet, opening  the door and walking into the kitchen. It seemed a little unnatural  for a moment, he seemed to be a chatty guy a few moments ago. The air felt heavy now, like his presence wasn’t as welcoming anymore despite his bright smile and kind demeanor.

Standing in the living room awkwardly I looked around again taking in the things I hadn’t noticed before. Laying on the coffee table was a VHS tape, it wasn't labeled. Looking up at the kitchen doorway the old man was standing there with a handkerchief in his hands,  clearing his throat, he spoke.

**Francis**: “Sorry son, I forgot to mention my name earlier. I’m Francis,” 

He reached out to give me a handshake while he stuffed his handkerchief in his back pocket. Reaching back out I gave him a firm handshake and I told him my name.

Giving me another one of his warmer smiles he reached over to grab the VHS tape putting it in a cabinet behind me while chortling to himself.

**Francis**: “Kids and their homemade movies. I'd be working down in the fields and they’d be over in that barn you saw playing cowboys and Indians, not until i got them a VHS recorder and took them to see ‘the wicker man’ They’d chase each other everywhere with that thing. Shame my boy broke it though,”

He grabbed another VHS tape, this one had a label on it that read “The Sacrifice” Francis walked towards their TV and put it in the player. What was he going to show me exactly? And I thought he was bringing me in for dinner, not a movie night.

Suddenly the TV turned on and two small children appeared in the same living room we sat in. A boy walked into frame holding a BB gun, he was wearing suspenders and had messier brown hair compared to the painting I saw of them earlier.

**Boy**: “I’ve come to the uhm, island to find a missing lady,”

He said with an authoritative tone. Then a little girl walks into frame with a little crown of dandelions on her head. Her hands politely behind her back and looking at her brother.

**Girl**: “oh she’s here, but you must join us at our… festival,”

The boy ran behind the camera and pointed it over to the fire pit with a teddy bear tied up next to it. You could hear the loud breathing of the boy as he handled the camera. I looked over at Francis and he had this goofy smile on his face, like this was the highlight of his evening.

**Boy**: “I won’t let you get away with this!” 

Suddenly the girl ran to the bear and tossed it into the fire. Her brother running around the camera and yelling as he pointed his BB gun at her, the girl ran behind the camera laughing as the boy shot and the screen went black.

**Francis**: “That’s how my boy broke it, shame really. I used to like filming down in the Church with my wife, she always had something to share with the community when we’d go out of town,”

**Reagan**: “oh wow that's uhm, that's nice?”

Francis’s smile faltered slightly as he put the VHS tape back and looked out the window. There was a pause, and sitting in this chair made me more uncomfortable by the second. I never really knew what to do when someone showed you pictures or home videos. Compliment them? I mean it was always strange, regardless of the family, but this film in particular was off putting. I grew up with siblings, and my brother and I were always doing weird shit. Sacrificing toys into a fire though? Absolutely not. Maybe farm kids were different. Suddenly he spoke, exhaling. 

**Francis**: “I oughta get the kids now, you wash up and we’ll have dinner ready at the table don’t you worry now,”

before I could say anything, he was gone. I released a pent up breath before getting off the couch and walking into the narrow hallway. After a short time I found their bathroom. It was nice but dated, with small blue and white tiles on the floor with a pretty yellow flower pattern on the walls.

Sitting down, I grabbed my camcorder out of my pocket, anxious to see that my battery was still good. Flipping it open I was met with a video. I watched in an odd trance as the sound of gravel steps approached after it fell. 

The camera was picked up, wiped and pointed at the house. It zoomed in and then focused on me at the doorstep. As I stepped through the doorway, it was dropped to the gravel again with a clatter.

Who the fuck was recording me on my own camcorder?

There was a knock at the door.

**Francis**: “Ya almost done son? Dinners ready now and everyone is excited to meet our new guest,”

**Reagan**: “Yeah I- I'll be out in a sec,”

I stuffed my camcorder back into my pocket as I turned the sink on and washed my hands and rinsed my face. Who could’ve done that? He said he had kids, right? It was probably them. It couldn’t have been Francis obviously, maybe he’d give me an answer.

I started making my way to the kitchen, rounding the hallway. I stood in the doorway to see a polished redwood dining table. 

I was greeted with truly unexpected faces.

A skinny man in his forties with thinning hair and unkept stubble, wearing both a dirty jean jacket and blue jeans. He had dark, sunken eyes and prominent cheek bones. Across from him was an older woman in her fifties with dark brown, almost black hair. She was wearing a green button up and blue jeans, her hair was in braids and she had scars around her lips. 

Walking to the table was Francis.

**Francis**: “Ah Reagan, took ya long enough! Sit, sit.”

He urged me as I slowly took a seat from the far side of the table. Moving my chair in, I noticed the lack of plates and kids that he said he was fetching.

**Reagan**: ""Where's dinner?”

**Francis**: “Don’t you worry now boy, it’s coming. You should be thankful, you’re gettin’ my wife's portion for tonight so you better savor every bite now,”

Not even a second goes by before a young girl enters the room with a small night gown. She looked about eleven years old and was holding a plate of food. She set it down on the table in front of Francis, no ‘thank you' was exchanged, nothing. She didn’t even look him in the eyes. Two other girls filed in and handed the other adults their plates, a final one of his daughters slipped through the door and set down mine. 

**Francis**: “Oh boy, this looks delicious doesn't it Bradley?”

**Bradley**: “Can’t wait to dig in, looks so good!” 

His deep, raspy voice didn’t suit him whatsoever. I couldn’t help but notice all four girls were standing, staring blankly and a little too intently at whatever was in front of them. Suddenly, Francis cleared his throat and the girls snapped awake. The oldest girl picked up a fork and took a piece of the meat from Francis’s plate. The rest of them stood by each adult and followed suit, the smaller ones climbing onto stools that I hadn’t noticed before. A wispy little thing, not even ten, clambered up beside me. She sat staring, forkful of peas in hand. I stared back at her as she moved the fork towards me. My stomach gave a weird twist and I turned my face away as I realized her intention. 

**Reagan**: “No don’t worry, I’ve got it sweetheart”

Just as I went to grab the fork from her, something flickered in her eyes that made me hesitate. Then, Francis rapped sharply on the table to get my attention.

**Francis**: “Ah ah ah Reagan, do you not know your table manners?”

The air fell silent and the tone had shifted. All eyes were on me, except for those poor girls. Francis had this look in his eyes that said all kinds of danger, it made my stomach turn.

**Francis**: “Let the girl feed you.”

I didn’t want to argue with someone who was so sure that something like this was ‘table manners’. The child held the fork to my mouth and I awkwardly took the food, glancing at the walls behind Francis to try and take my mind off of this. Scanning the walls I noticed the same girl in those family portraits but she seemed older, it was Sarah. She had to be here. I came back to reality remembering the situation I'm in.  I chewed slowly as I felt the breath from the girl hit my cheek, I dared not move away. Francis didn't seem the type to care about personal space, and I didn't need him to give more orders to me or the girls. The eldest daughter sat close to Francis, wiping his face with a cloth napkin. Bradley was getting the same treatment, but the woman snatched the cloth away before the daughter could grab it. I preemptively smeared my hand across my face before grabbing the napkin into my lap. Not a word left any of their mouths, nothing at all.

Dinner was finally over and the girls grabbed the plates and put them in the sink before going off into the hallway.

The adults all began washing up. sitting at the dining table still I was left speechless, worried even for those little girls. Suddenly Francis walked back in this time with a more sincere look on his face.

**Francis**: “Sorry bout that Reagan, I didn’t mean to, Snap at you,”

**Reagan**: “It’s uh, it's okay,”

I turned around for a moment to look at a watch that wasn't even on my wrist, I just needed to find any excuse to leave this house now.

**Reagan**: “Oh look at the time, I better be on my way home now,”

**Francis**: “Leavin so soon now? You better stay the night here, in a warm house,”

I shook my head before trying to slip by Francis towards the door. He put his hand in the way and cleared his throat.

**Francis**: “I’ll never forget what you did for us boy, you’re welcome here if you ever change your mind,”

**Reagan**: “Y-yeah no problem, thanks for dinner,”

I said before slipping out the door quickly. I was met with a strong breeze and a thicker layer of snow from the last time I was outside.

I stepped off the porch and walked down what I could see off the road.

As I approached my truck I quickly hopped inside and closed the door. I put the key into the ignition and the truck started. Immediately I turned the heater on, but to my surprise it was still as shitty as ever. I rubbed my hands together thinking about what had just happened, kids feeding their parents? Or whatever they were to those kids, it was bizarre. Why would Sarah be in any way interested in coming back to live with these people?

I put the truck in drive and checked my rearview before stepping on the gas.

Nothing.

The truck was stuck, like this evening wasn't already amazing.

I stepped out and popped the hood open, looking around and everything seemed fine, so I closed it. Walking to the back of the truck I checked the tires and one was flat.

**Reagan**: “GOD DAMNIT!” 

I kicked the side of the truck before getting back in and slamming the door. I can't leave now, I'm stuck here until morning or if they magically have a spare tire on their farm. Chances are they won’t.

I took my jacket off and laid down on my seats putting it over me, I started to shiver. It was now Francis’s offer started to echo in my head. I laid there for what felt like a while before I sat up and put my hands in front of the heater to feel the smallest warm breeze. I couldn't sit in this truck all night, there's no way my own body heat would warm it up, not like it’d be comfortable sleeping in here anyway.

I started to think about Sarah, and why she was the reason I came here. I can't just run away now. No matter how weird this family is, I'm not leaving without Sarah or some solid evidence on where she is,

Closing the truck door I marched my way back to the house in the snow. I refuse to freeze in a rickety old truck the whole night.

As I made my way to the door step Francis was standing at the window with his arms crossed and turned towards the front door.

**Francis**: ""What’d you say about that heater in your truck again? I knew you’d change your mind son,”

He had this snarky smile on his face like he’d just won an argument. I hated that look. My brother had it perfected, he knew just how to get under my skin. I always felt criticized by that smirk, even if it was just a sibling thing. It was even worse coming from this old guy. What right did he have to judge me? Sure, he got his way, but that was coincidental. Sulking inside, I kicked the snow off my boots and took them off before I saw Francis staring at me.

**Francis**: “Your room is down the hall, last door to the left,”

**Reagan**: “Where's all the kids?”

**Francis**: “They’re sleeping Reagan, not like that’s any of your business now is it? Head to bed, we oughta find a spare for you in the morning bright and early,”

His smug look faded as he spoke. He stood there unmoving as I awkwardly ducked past him into the hall. His tone had a strange quality. It lingered in your head like every word he said really mattered, telling you everything you needed to know and more. It was overwhelming to me and I couldn't shake the feeling that he just knows something I don't. 

I slowly walked past some of the doors until I heard something faint, like a whimper or cry of sorts. I peaked into one of the rooms to see a little boy with a thick book in his hands, standing in front of him was Bradley, no words between them were exchanged. My breath fell short as I saw them. Instinctually I pulled out my camcorder and pointed it into the crack as Bradley slowly took the book from the boy’s hands then snatched his arm, dragging him further into the room. I tried to step in closer.

**Francis**: “What did I say about this being any of your business Reagan…”

I looked back, shoving my camcorder in my coat. 

**Reagan**: “s-sorry i was just- uh,”

Francis gently shoved me away from the door before walking into the room and closing it behind him. This guy was rubbing me the wrong way. Maybe I should be more agreeable, this was his home after all. I didn’t know his deal, I shouldn’t get involved. Still, for being so kind to me, I didn’t see a lot of that for his kids. Once I got to the aforementioned door, I hesitantly opened it to find a rather unremarkable room. There was a nicely made bed with grey covers and brown pillows, not a great color match but it’s what you would expect from a guest room in a farm house. The room was dark, which I appreciated, and the curtains blocked out any hint of the snow outside, so I took off my jacket and laid in bed. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I saw pictures of the family again, the one with the same red sweaters. In hindsight, no one at the table that night could be recognized in that picture, except for Francis of course. Was this really Sarah's family? These were the people she was raised by? I still don’t understand why she would ever want to come back here before getting married. My attention moved to the mother. She certainly wasn't the silent, sharp faced woman I saw at supper. Looking for more proof, my eyes landed on another picture frame on the bedside table. Even in the shadow, the mother’s eyes seemed to shine. They had power, an authority that I couldn’t place. I could only imagine what she would've been like if she showed up for dinner. My eyes felt heavy, it's been a long day and all I need right now is to fall asleep.

Long story short, I was ill for 7 months, after getting sick with Covid, dr’s couldn’t figure out why. Then woke up one day even sicker than usual, like the mother of all flu’s. Weeks later woke up with vasculitis lesions all over my legs and feet. Dr put me on either 60 or 80mg prednisone. Everything is better now about 5 months later. Tapering has sucked but I’m down to 1.5mg. My question though, is would it be possible for such a small amount to still cause the jittery and sweaty side effects? I’m absolutely drenched everywhere I go. It’s annoying. And I’m still “up”, like I had too much coffee. It’s better than the rage and emotional disturbances of the high doses. I ask because the severe sweating was one of my symptoms when I was dealing with these autoimmune issues, so I worry if it’s coming back now that I’ve lowered my dose. However, I don’t wake up feeling like I’m dying every day so I’m sure it’s just the prednisone. I still have that kinda general cruddy off feeling the meds gave me too, just not in such high amounts.

TLDR, tapered down from 80mg to 1.5MG of prednisone, still drenched in sweat and irritable and cruddy. Is it safe to assume it’s the prednisone? ",1,1757828065.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Was I an AH?/ UPDATE,"I was 15 (a girl) when I reached out to him. I was told the whole story by someone who used to be close to my mother and then I made my own research with other people that were present at the time. My father was a Russian immigrant here. He came with his siblings and their mother. No father. My mother is wealthy and he used to work for her family in the yard. Barely spoke any English.

I was born a few days before he turned 18 and when he turned 18 he got married to my mother and she was very abusive. Controlling, possessive, made him limit and then cut contact with his family. He stayed married to her for 5 or 6 years. She caught him cheating with the woman his age that was babysitting me.

I reached out at 15 and he hesitantly agreed to meet but I had to take an adult with me and it was my mother. She didn't get inside the coffee shop with me but looked at the interraction from the street and he kept looking at her. Wasn't comfortable at all. I look just like him. Blue eyes, light brown hair, thin and and tall. I couldn't believe how similar we are. He is married to someone. I was 15. I knew he has his reasons to avoid Mom but I felt so rejected. I brought him something I painted and wanted to get to know him while he was cold and distant. . I had to bring at 15 an adult with me, but only had my mother, grandma and my mother's boyfriend at the time. I talked with mother's brother but he said he doesn't want to see that "" spoiled Russian brat"" of my father again

I felt he doesn't want me and I felt rejected so I wrote him a text on IG that I don't want to be a burden for him nor do I want him to keep in contact when he clearly doesn't want me. My text was so long and his reply was: You don't understand but I can't do this.

Now I am 19 and he reached out.

Mother told me he cheated on her a lot and once hit her head against the table. I asked him about this and he admitted he did it. Because she didn't tell him and make sure he doesn't know that his mother died. And also that ex friend of her told me that Dad once was drunk and angry and crying and he ra...ped my Mom. For now everything that woman told me was confirmed.

1ngisod,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1ngisod/one_time_my_friend_and_i_got_into_a_giant/,One time my friend and I got into a giant accident on the way to an NFL game,"I randomly decided to go to a Cardinals game in Albert Pujols' final year and saw a great deal for the green seats behind home plate. Only for $175 when they're normally $500+!

Well i was casually talking to the older guy to my left all game and had good talks. Towards the end of the game the guy said he offered my tickets to any game at his personal suite on the 50 yard line for any KC chiefs game

So of course I jumped on it. I picked and game and at 9 am on a Saturday my friend and I headed out for the game. Around like 10:45 am I suggested we stop by Ozarkland to check out stuff. I got off the exit and started to turn left. Suddenly it was as if a b*mb went off and I had a high pitched ringed in my ears and I was disoriented and only knew I was in a lot of pain. Saw smoke coming from the steering wheel

Eventually it subsided and both of us got out of the car. Apparently an old guy in a giant truck t-boned us after he blew the light. He called 911 and the highway patrol had me drive my car to the gas station despite not being able to see through the windshield

We just sat there waiting for it to get towed. Not knowing what to do. My insurance said they lined up a car at the enterprise 30 minutes away. But we were in a rural area with no car. Suddenly a woman drives up to us and asking if we needed a ride. Apparently it was the drivers daughter and offered to take us

So we get to the rental car place at the regional airport and the guy says ""we only give out cars for airport customers"". We sat there again defeated. My friends dad offered to pick us up and take us back. Well my dad suggested I ask one more time to see. Sure enough I did and the guy offered us a truck

Well I took it and we drove to a food place for lunch. I told my friend to not have any alcohol in case we had a concussion. We eventually got to my aunt and uncles for the weekend. Went to the game and it was good. We drove back and got home fine. Feeling unscathed

Well the next morning I started feeling off. I missed some normal times for things at work. I got home and left my iced coffee on the fridge. I went to the urgent care and got diagnosed with a concussion and a deviated septum

Got the news my car was totaled and a total loss. My insurance put in 30k for a new car and I had ordered a new one but it would be weeks. I took time off work and felt kinda down, garbled my speech

The weekend after I visited family for my birthday and had a good time. At the get together I felt a little something in my throat. Felt like allergies. Next morning I woke up and couldn't taste or smell and of course got diagnosed with covid

I ended up getting an accident attorney and after 7 months got a $13.8k settlement which was good

That being said, I learned you can still reprogram the coffee pods to dispense the same amount of water as a double espresso.

My question is that, if I do reprogram the coffee pods to dispense the same amount of water as a double espresso pod, will the result be a double espresso strength brew?

I'm very sorry to everyone who worked hard on their PhDs but if you need to list that you're a doctor, and insist on being called Doctor at check in, you're probably a brat. I've never dealt with someone who listed it that didn't have a holier-than-thou attitude because they could afford to get a medical degree/doctorate. 

Anyways this guy and his wife come in and right off the bat they're fussy. 

Me: welcome to 'insert brand location', can I get the name? 

Guest: Schmuck

Me: Kevin? 

G: that's *Doctor* Schmuck to you. And I'm gonna need 4 waters. 

Me having been there all of 3 minutes and already tired. Previous shift hasn't even walked out the door and I know it's gonna be a long audit shift. 

I check him in, start doing the spiel of breakfast hours, coffee, ect and he cuts me off to tell me to talk slower and softer because they're tired. No problem, I talk fast, so I repeat it all slower while he huffs and grumbles aboutbme being too slow now. Then demands another 2 waters, which whatever. I've given him 3x the amount he's supposed to get now but I just want him out of my lobby. 

His wife asks for extra towels, I get them, she asks for even more towels, and then tissue, and then some other stuff, and instead of asking for it all at once I have to go back several timesbecauses they won't just tell me everything at once. She forgets her tissue. 

He comes down later while I'm on the phone and loudly talks over me while I'm trying to explain something to someone and demands the tissue, which I still had on the desk so I hand it over with a smile but don't respond cause I'm *on the phone* and he gets so fussy about it. You'd honestly think this man was about to have a tantrum at not being the center of the universe for me tonight. 

A couple minutes later I notice there's a car parked under our awning. No big deal we've had a lot of people going in and out all night, and being sold out some people will idle while they look for something available. But the car is empty so I wait almost an hour before checking the plates and realizing who it is. Joy. 

I call and he's immediately huffy and annoyed but sir you can't park in front of the doors. That's common sense. You're lucky I called and didn't just have it towed/ticketed.

He comes down and yells at me about interrupting their meal because they're tired and there's another car off to the side so why can't he park in front of the doors under the awning?! 

Sir, thats my vehicle. You have keys that allow you to enter any door on the outside of this building so you don't have to walk in the dark around the building to enter. I do not have such a luxury. I've been told by management that I'm allowed to park there for my safety and because I need to leave spots open for guests on days that we're sold out. We have limited parking. I am not parking directly in front of the doors like you are, I am off to the side by the gardens, specifically out of the way. But he wanted to blame me for people being unable to unload by the doors.Het tells at me saying I shouldn't be allowed to park there because there's no signage stating night audit employees can park there and that, simultaneously, he should be allowed to park there because there's no signage stating it's not a parking spot. 

He started ranting at me about how rude I was about this, took my name and my plate number, which is so fucking weird of him to do, and made some weird comments about me ending up on a gurney in his hospital. I was so tempted to kick him out after that but he eventually just went to his room and I shall be hanging out in the back office until day shift arrives.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Silkeborg IF vs. OB Odense BK: A Parlay of Wits and Wickets**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a Danish Derby Deep Dive! We’re here to dissect the September 14 clash between **Silkeborg IF** and **OB Odense BK**, where the stakes are high, the spreads are tighter than a goalie’s grip on a rebound, and the Over/Under line is low enough to make a toddler question their snack choices. Let’s parse the odds, digest the news, and serve up a parlay that’ll make your bookie weep into their coffee.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

Silkeborg IF enters as the firm favorite, with **odds ranging from +115 (2.15 decimal)** to +200 (3.1 decimal), depending on where you’re placing your chips. That translates to an **implied probability of 46-55%** for a Silkeborg win. OB Odense BK, meanwhile, is priced between **+250 (2.95 decimal)** and +300 (3.1 decimal), implying a **25-33% chance** to pull off the upset. The draw? A cozy 3.5-3.65 (28-29% implied), because nothing says “thrilling football” like a stalemate.

The **spreads** are a razor-thin **-0.25 for Silkeborg** and **+0.25 for OB**, both at even money (1.91). It’s the football equivalent of betting on which sock will hit the floor first in a laundry pile. The **Over/Under 2.5 goals** is the most compelling angle, with **Over priced at 1.7 (58.8% implied)** and Under at 2.13-2.23 (46.9-47.6% implied). Given Silkeborg’s recent form and OB’s… well, lack of recent news, Over feels like the logical pick.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Coach Drama and Handball Heartbreak

Let’s start with the **Silkeborg IF** camp. Their new coach, **Steve Cooper**, just led Brøndby to a **2-1 derby win** over FC København, praising his team’s “heart and soul” like a motivational speaker at a yoga retreat. Cooper’s philosophy? Win without spending money—because apparently, “soul” is the new transfer market. His confidence is infectious, and with a derby victory under his belt, he’s riding the Danish equivalent of a red bull-fueled rollercoaster.

On the flip side, **OB Odense BK** is… well, here’s the TL;DR: \*No major injuries, no star players on paternity leave (unlike Odense H

1ngigon,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngigon,When I discovered Chaayos…,"Most Indians have a special morning ritual when it comes to their drinks—it could be anything from a creamy cappuccino to a robust black coffee, or even refreshing lemon tea, green tea, espresso, or a good old cup of chai. Speaking of chai, it's fascinating how this beverage has played such a big role in the world economy, and once you find your perfect cup, you'll understand why the British went head over heels for it and made it their national drink! 😅 

I’m definitely a tea lover here! In my home, we had set times for tea—6 am, 9 am, 3 pm, and 6 pm. But when I got married, there were two things I really struggled with: the tea at my in-laws and the curd. Honestly, they just didn’t know how to make it right! That experience made me appreciate why my grandfather would always ask my mom to brew tea whenever he visited someone in our village, no matter how many cups were offered to him. 

After getting married, I realized that finding that same comforting taste I've loved since childhood would be quite the challenge. So, I decided to learn how to make my own tea! Fast forward to today, and I’m on my third attempt. Unfortunately, the milk curdled twice! 

In my opinion, a day that starts without milk, tea leaves, ginger, and sugar feels like doomsday! This morning really had me feeling that way, but my husband suggested we try something different. I usually don’t like changes and can be a bit skeptical, but today, I was just too tired to give it a third shot. So, he ordered from “Chaayos” and surprisingly, it turned out great!

One of the perks of living in a city is that you can just wake up, sit with your books, and order your favorite drink. It’ll be delivered right to your room, just like when I was at home. My mother used to bring me tea in bed, and guess what? You can enjoy that luxury here too! I’m feeling so grateful for these little moments. 🌟",0,1757826249.0,punediaries,0,0.17,False

This is one of the most asked questions about Bigg Boss 😅 — Are the love stories inside real, or just strategy?
The answer is a mix of yes and no, depending on the couple.

❤️ When it’s true love

Isolation + Intensity: Inside the house, emotions are magnified. With no phones, family, or outside life, contestants spend 24/7 together. That closeness can create genuine bonds.

Examples: Some couples like Karishma Tanna–Upen Patel (though they broke up later), and Tejasswi Prakash–Karan Kundrra (still together) showed real chemistry that continued outside.

Signs of realness: They support each other even when it harms their game, remain consistent after the show, and handle outside-world challenges together.


🎭 When it’s strategy or “showmance”

Screen Time = Survival: Makers give more footage to love angles. Contestants know this, so some fake relationships for popularity.

Mutual Benefit: Two contestants might agree (silently) to act like a couple because fans will root for them more.

Signs of fakeness: The “love” ends right after the finale, or one person suddenly distances themselves when cameras are off.

⚖️ The Truth

Love in Bigg Boss is often fast-forwarded—what takes months outside happens in days inside.

Some relationships are genuine, but many are situational, born out of loneliness, pressure, or strategy.

The real test is after the show: if they survive fame, fans, and family together, then yes, it was real.

👉 So, Bigg Boss love is like a pressure cooker romance: sometimes real, sometimes cooked up, but always entertaining.

# Alright, this is the real juice of Bigg Boss psychology 🍵. The makers are masters at designing the house as a pressure cooker, where even calm people eventually break. Here are the tricks they use:



🎥 1. 24/7 Surveillance = No Escape


Cameras everywhere—even bathrooms have surveillance (with blurred feeds).
Contestants feel like they’re always being judged.
No privacy → no outlet to vent → pressure builds.



⏳ 2. Isolation from the Outside World


No phones, TV, books, internet, or family contact.
You lose your “anchors” of normal life—no distraction, just the same faces daily.
This makes small conflicts feel huge, because the house becomes your entire world.


🔄 3. Unpredictable Rules & Twists


Bigg Boss often changes rules suddenly. Tasks end mid-way, favorites get nominated unfairly, alliances get shaken.
This creates uncertainty and stress, which breaks strong personalities.



🍲 4. Food & Comfort Manipulation


Limited ration → contestants fight over food.
Luxury items are tied to tasks → losing means discomfort (cold water, no coffee, no bed).
Lack of comfort = short temper + emotional meltdowns.



🎭 5. Group Politics Pressure


Tasks are designed to force people into teams, betray friends, or confront rivals.
Example: “Choose who is the least deserving.”
This creates guilt, anger, and endless fights.



🧨 6. Provocation Editing


Makers give more screen time to fights, insults, and emotional breakdowns.
Contestants realize that “being silent = invisible.” So, they fight more to survive.
Even if they want peace, the environment rewards drama.



🕰 7. Time Distortion


Contestants don’t know the real time (no clocks, no outside news).
Days feel longer, nights feel shorter, and this messes with mental balance.



🌀 8. Confession Room Therapy


Bigg Boss calls contestants alone. They vent their pain, but the “therapy” is also strategic—sometimes BB gives hints, sometimes plays mind games to test them further.





👉 All these tricks together create a world where:


Small problems feel like life or death.

Emotions get magnified.

Even strong celebs crack under pressure.



That’s why the audience finds it addictive—it feels “real,” but in truth, it’s a designed psychological battlefield.

1ngif61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1ngif61/carrying_forward_love_memory_and_sephardic_life/,"Carrying Forward: Love, Memory, and Sephardic Life.","I have felt compelled to share a personal reflection on caregiving, memory, and heritage, experiences which have felt deeply cathartic, and that have traced the threads of love, presence, and tradition that flow between generations. I hope that, in reading it, others may find resonance, whether in caring for someone, being cared for, or feeling the enduring pulse of our Jewish traditions in everyday life.

I have spent the past four months moving in the quiet rhythm of another life, a life that stretches backward across decades and forward into memory in ways I have yet to fully understand, while caring for an elder from my synagogue who, after a serious fall that left two limbs broken, passed a month in the hospital and three more in a nursing home. Now returned home, he has filled my days and nights, his voice flowing between French and Arabic—the voices of my own Teta and my Jiddo, and of generations before them. In tending to him, in the simple acts of preparing meals, steadying his steps, and listening to stories told and retold, I have felt threads of Sephardic life weaving themselves back into me: the cadence of prayer, the warmth of the kitchen table, the hush of memory carried through exile and return. Somehow, through his care, my own soul has been mended, bound again to the living fabric of our people. I am the youngest at my synagogue who still speaks these languages, and despite two generations of age between us, perhaps that is why he and the other elders have welcomed me as family, as someone who could hold memory in her hands, as someone who could carry forward what might otherwise be lost. 

I am the lone Lebanese-Jew at my Sephardic synagogue, a Baal Teshuva that has walked into a world of Moroccan customs and melodies. Over the past eighteen months, these elders have embraced me as their own: teaching me Shabbat and Chagim rituals, recipes, prayers, the care of body and soul, guiding me through the hardest days of my divorce, wiping tears from my face, reminding me that love and belonging are never lost if you are willing to receive them. Now, caring for this elder, I have felt that same embrace passing through me, threading into every fold of a blanket, every cup of tea, every gentle touch. The first morning I lifted his coffee, his fingers trembling, his eyes steady, I felt my Jiddo. Not in story, not in memory, but in the pulse of my hands, in the rhythm of my breath, and in the quiet insistence of presence that reaches across generations as if to say: I am here, and you are not alone, and amid this ancestral whisper, I have wept quietly, because in that moment, I understood something I had not yet known: that love can move through absence, through decades, through silence, through grief we have not yet learned to name. The ache I carried — my divorce, the empty spaces of my own childhood, years of quiet longing, softened under the touch of that presence, as if my neshama were being stitched back together, thread by careful thread. 

Feeding him, folding his blanket, adjusting his walker, listening to him hum melodies of synagogues that no longer stand—each act became a prayer, each breath a tether to what had been nearly lost. The scent of bread baking somewhere distant, sunlight spilling across stone floors, the soft whisper of French and Arabic between us, all of it became a map through time. I saw my ancestors in the folds of his hands, in the cadence of his voice, and in the melodies I have always carried in my bones. These months have taught me that caregiving is not only physical: it is temporal, spiritual, and a conversation across generations, for every word spoken, every gesture given, every pause shared carries history, exile, resilience. It represents a pulse beneath the surface, threading through me, through him, through the spaces where memory and presence meet. My neshama, once frayed and quiet, breathes differently now, for it pulses fuller, softer, and stronger. 

Since his discharge from the facility, I've stayed with him in his home, caring for him, day in, day out, night after night. The weight of it has pressed, yet it has felt sacred. Supporting him has been more than just caregiving, it has symbolized a bridge, a dialogue with absence, a continuity of love that survives war, exile, silence, and time, and in tending to him, I have been tended. In listening, I have been remembered, in presence, I have been healed, and in the quiet, I have felt my Jiddo beside me, guiding me as he might have if I had known him in life, whispering insistently: This is love, this is home, this is how we endure, and this is how we carry forward. I carry that, fully, in the rhythm of my hands, in the pulse of my breath, in the melody of my neshama, in the quiet insistence of a Sephardic heart that refuses to break, that refuses to be silent, that insists on memory, continuity, and the enduring voice of those who came before.

This care has felt sacred, almost ancestral. My Jiddo passed a year before I was born, his final years spent in a nursing home, a place that held both fragility and dignity. In tending to this elder, I feel a quiet echo of him — as if a hand has reached through time, threading my own presence into the continuum of care, love, and memory. My elder's frailty, after months in a hospital and nursing home following a fall, mirrors the vulnerability I have known intimately throughout my own lifetime: decades of autoimmune illness, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgeries, even a year of paralysis. I know the ache of dependence, the sharpness of fragility, and the delicate persistence of healing. Yet, through this intimacy, through the quiet rituals of care, something has transformed. Each hum he offers, each phrase in French or Arabic, each story of Casablanca or memory of lost streets becomes a lifeline, carrying me back to Beirut, to the pulse of my family, my Jiddo, my Sephardic-Lebanese heritage. Every act of care is both giving and receiving, mending and being mended. In the touch of his hand, the tilt of his head, the smile that flickers across his face, I feel the deep continuity of Sephardic life: resilience, hospitality, devotion, and love.

In this weaving of past and present, Moroccan and Lebanese, illness and recovery, I have sensed something sacred. Caregiving is not only for the living — it is also for the continuity of memory, the preservation of lineage, the gentle passing of ancestral threads. Here, in the hum of conversation, in the steam rising from tea, in the folding of blankets, Casablanca and Beirut breathe together. And in that breath, I feel the pulse of generations, the quiet insistence of Sephardic life, and the unbroken thread of love, presence, and memory reaching across time and space — from my Jiddo to me, from Morocco to Lebanon, from past to present. With his roots tracing back to Morocco, and in his voice, in the way he hums melodies from his youth, I feel Lebanon reaching out to Morocco, old Sephardic rhythms crossing the Mediterranean, carrying the same prayer, the same longing, the same devotion, the same heart. Beirut and Casablanca, Bhamdoun and Marrakesh, meet in our shared language, in the cadence of French and Arabic, in the flicker of memory that lives in gestures, in song, in touch. These threads converge, and suddenly the stories of exile, of survival, of resilience, are not separate—they are one, a tapestry of people, place, and heart.

Through tending to him, I have felt past and present entwine, where care becomes memory, memory becomes healing, and healing becomes love passed forward. Presence is a prayer, touch is a legacy, and in each gesture, each shared story, caregiving becomes a bridge carrying love, memory, and renewal across generations.",2,1757826096.0,Judaism,0,1.0,False

Some of my earliest memories are him babysitting me when my mom was in school. He would usually take my side against my older sisters who would pick on me. When I was 12, he taught me how to drive and I would spend hours driving him around dirt roads while he'd drink beer. He had a girlfriend when I was 13 and he tried to kill himself when they broke up.

When I was 16, he asked me to go for a drive with him and he was taking pills and drinking the whole time. Then right before he passes out, he tells me that he overdosed and needs to get to a hospital. We were in the middle of nowhere and I didn't know how to get to a hospital. I ended up running up to a random house and  having them call an ambulance. That time changed something in our relationship and I've never looked at him the same way. Through the rest of my teens, he would often call me at 2 or 3 on the morning when he was drunk and driving home from the bar. I always felt like I had to answer because I worried that he might be depressed and might hurt himself if he was lonely and drunk.

I got a restraining order on him in my 20s because he started doing harder drugs and was stealing from my house. We didn't talk for 5 years. We eventually got into contact again. For the last five years, he's been in a continuous cycle of going to rehab, relapsing and back to treatment. He can't keep a job, has nothing in the way of possessions, I believe he has brain damage from all the drug use. Sometimes he seems to care about family but most of the time he wants something, even if it's just a cup of coffee or a pack of cigarettes. I barely do anything financially for him. I don't enjoy being around him. I have a lot of anger towards him, I often feel used, I feel like he's wasted his life and I refuse to waste my time taking care of him.

I feel sorry for him but I also feel angry at him. I wish things were different but I can't even stand listening to him talk. I'd like to move away and not tell him where I am. He's always talked a good game but has never been able to make it come true. I don't feel like I have any hope left for him, which is terrible to say but I am at the point where I want to save myself. I don't want to go through the upheaval and emotional toll he brings to my life. I worry that his whole life will be consumed by drugs and drinking and he's going to die a horrible lonely death because of it and there isn't anything I can do about it.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

The rug is an 8x10 and I like the size but I want to replace it as its old and worn as well. Would a deeper/darker coloured rug (blue? burgundy? green? brown?) make it seem too dark with the dark floors?

My wife and I have been together for 13 years, married 9. We have two kids (5 and 2), she works part time as a teacher and I work at home as a consultant. My job is crazy at times, working 10-12 hours days with some travel here and there. Our moms watch the kids so there's no daycare and our 5 y.o. is in preschool 3 days a week for a couple hours. Although my job is demanding and I make great money, and I have the freedom between meetings to stop in throughout the day to play with the kids... if my wife is having a rough day I go and get her a coffee/sandwich for lunch, etc... I step out from work at about 6, eat dinner with the family, play with the kiddos/try to give my wife a break, and either clean the house (dishes, vacuuming, counters wiped, etc.) or get the kids in the bath/shower. I usually watch a show with my wife until she goes to bed (she leaves early for school and I get the kids up and ready), then I go back to work. 

On the weekends I encourage my wife to get out of the house for hikes, walks, glass of wine at the local winery. She got into golf with her girlfriends this Summer and takes lessons every week with them and I couldn't be happier for her. I almost have to yell at her to go out and have a drink/food afterwards and enjoy some time away. I get her flowers every Sunday when I do the grocery shopping, and I wash/fold/put away the laundry every weekend. We live on 4 acres and I do all the outside work from grass/leaves/watering to building walls and putting landscape lights up.

She's a great mom to our kids, incredibly attractive, and very smart. This is what kills me ...I'm so into her and just constantly feel like I'm just a paycheck. The day we got married our sexlife changed. She was a FREAK while we were dating/engaged and immediately went down hill after marriage. We went from having sex twice a day to sex twice on our entire honeymoon. I'll say I'm attractive (been used by my company and others as a marketing model), have an above average ""member"", and am very in tune with my sexuality. She says that marriage brought up religious trauma that clicked when we said ""I do"". 

We've had dozens of ""talks"" over the years and it seems everytime she gets better for two weeks and then falls back into her same mind frame. I am an avid listener of sex with Emily, shameless sex and the horny housewife (shout-out!), have read come as you are/mating in captivity/etc. multiple times...I have also subscribed to massage courses, beducated, and OMG YES. I have bought my wife probably 25 toys/lubes over the course of our marriage to see what she likes, and I am very open with her with what I enjoy sexually/fantasies/etc. she finally read mating in captivity after months of me asking her (I started ready ACOTAR/CRESCENT CITY/ETC and said if I'm reading your books then please read one of mine). Side note but she reads the smutty books but fast forwards through the sex scenes ...

When we had our second, she thought she wouldn't breastfeed for more than 6 months...we're going on 26 months and there's no end in sight. Although she's down to 1 feed a day, she can't take medication to regulate her period/hormones until she's officially done feeding. Between the lack of hormone regulation and the Zoloft, I am almost completely ignored. We had a huge fight in April about this....I had told her in November I was severely depressed and missing connection with her or any sort of desire from her and she basically blew it off. I sent her books/podcasts/reddit threads of women asking how to flirt with their husbands, etc ...and really nothing has changed. I also got a vasectomy last year because she said she was worried about getting pregnant again but of course nothing changed. 

That said, she's done things every once in a while...she wore a black bra and panties once when I got out of the shower and laid on the bed, and she recently gave me a footjob after I massaged her feet (not usually a foot guy but it was awesome!!) but it's incrediblely depressing having 2 or 3 exciting situations in 6 months after a big conversation. At the time of our last fight she said she was ""too comfortable to think about sex"" and she needed to get over her religious trauma from 20 years ago. I had basically given up after our fight when things went back to her normal, but two weeks ago after her golf time she said something that broke me. She said all the other wives were talking about their husbands and how they don't help with the housework, kids, etc. and she nothing to contribute to the conversation...says I go above and beyond (on top of making the $$) and she couldn't be happier. 

It killed me that I work so hard and try with my being to put her first everyday and she has done approximately nothing in terms of what I specified I like (flirty texts, butt pics, sexual kinks, underwear under the pillow or in my pocket/etc.) yet she has no complaints about our marriage or me. We have what I would call routine sex (same motions Everytime) about twice a month. I cannot touch her sexually, even over underwear. This kills me because going down on her was my 100% favorite thing ever and now I can't even rub her clit with a finger. Foreplay is turn to the side and make out for a few min while she jerks me to get hard and says ""get the lube"". Of course sex is painful for the first couple minutes for her because she's not warmed up AT ALL. She's usually on top to start and I tell her just to sit on it and relax to warm up but she usually ignores it....very obvious she just wants to get it over with, she won't even look me in the eyes most of the time. Again I've sent her countless podcasts/reels/etc. about the importance of foreplay. I have good stamina and technique so she ends up orgasming about 75% of the time (could be taking) but I try to make her feel as much pleasure as possible. 

We're watching ""four seasons"" on Netflix and all I could think is I'm going to end up like Steve Carrell (we're only halfway through) and just have enough after 20 years... I know motherhood changes perspective, but she's been saying ""I'm old I can't have fun"" since she was about 27 and refusing anything fun/exciting/not routine. I don't want to leave my kids, her, or our property, but my mental health continues to be at an all time low for the last 6-7 years. 

I don't even need any comments or advice, I just needed to get this out. ",2,1757825213.0,Marriage,6,0.75,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

*Where Underdogs Go to Cry and Favorites Go to Nap*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Mediocrity**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. TSV 1860 München is a **-1.75 goal spread favorite** at Bovada, with a moneyline of **1.25** (implied probability: **80%**). That’s the kind of odds that make you think, *“Are they even playing football, or just handing out points?”* Meanwhile, TSV Havelse is a **+8.5 underdog** (implied probability: **10.5%**), which is about the same chance as winning the lottery if your ticket is a crumpled receipt and a hopeful prayer. The total goals line sits at **3.0**, with the **Over** priced at **1.67** (60% implied) and the **Under** at **2.15** (47% implied).

Historically, 1860 Munich’s recent form isn’t exactly a masterclass in dominance—last season they finished 14th in the 3. Liga—but they’re still a club with a storied name and a budget that lets them buy coffee for the entire squad. Havelse? They’re the team that lost 0-3 to Aue, whose players joked they “*kann anscheinend noch nicht diese Saison*” (translation: “can’t even figure out this season”).

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and One Too Many “Unfassbar” Quotes**  
The MagentaSport roundup doesn’t exactly gush about Havelse’s prospects. Their last match? A 1-3 loss to Stuttgart II, where their defense looked like a group of toddlers trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube. Coach Jens Härtel called the 0-3 home defeat to Viktoria Köln “*brutal*,” but even he admitted, *“I don’t see it that black.”* Translation: *“We’re not dead yet, but we’re not exactly alive either.”*

On the flip side, 1860 Munich’s recent 3-1 win over

1nghziz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jamaica/comments/1nghziz/world_bank_assessment_of_the_jamaicas_agriculture/,World Bank Assessment of the Jamaica's Agriculture Economy,"This is a long post so here's the TL;DR: Jamaica has strong potential to grow its agriculture sector by using idle land, improving farming methods, and focusing on high-value crops like fruits, vegetables, and spices. While the country relies heavily on food imports and faces challenges like low yields, outdated practices, and climate risks, there is growing political support to modernize agriculture. Small farms dominate the landscape but lack access to quality inputs and technology. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in food supply and tourism, but also pushed the sector toward digital solutions. With better policies, investment, and innovation, Jamaica could boost food security, create jobs, and strengthen its economy.

It's good for *everyone* to understand this, not just the decision makers. If something needs clarification let me know and I'll try my best, Next post will be on the recommendations.

In 2019, agriculture made up 7 percent of Jamaica’s economy and provided jobs for 15 percent of the population. About 44 percent of the island’s 2.9 million people lived in rural areas. At the same time, Jamaica imported more than three times the amount of agricultural food it exported, resulting in a trade deficit of US$837.1 million, or 5.1 percent of GDP. Because of this heavy reliance on imported food, the government introduced policies to encourage local production. The slowdown in global trade during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns about food security.

Jamaica has an opportunity to grow valuable crops such as fruits, vegetables, and spices for export to both new and existing markets. Replacing some imported foods with locally grown ones could be a practical first step toward building a stronger agricultural economy.

The country’s long-term national development plan, Vision 2030 Jamaica, identifies agriculture as one of nine industries with international competitiveness. The plan supports this goal through institutions such as the Agro Investment Corporation, along with efforts to improve access to agricultural credit, infrastructure, and research and development. Historically, most government support has focused on a few subsectors including poultry, meat, and sugar. In contrast, other areas that perform well in trade, such as oranges and coffee, have received little support or have even been taxed. These misaligned incentives may lead farmers to make decisions that do not align with Jamaica’s broader economic goals.

Farming in Jamaica is divided between two main groups. A small number of large commercial plantations grow single crops like sugar or coffee for export. Meanwhile, many small farms grow a mix of crops and rely on strong local farming traditions. These farms mainly produce food for household use or for sale within Jamaica. Small farms account for 41 percent of the country’s 440,000 hectares of farmland. Around 80 percent of farmers work on plots that are 2 hectares or smaller, and nearly 70 percent farm on less than 1 hectare.

Jamaica’s favorable climate and growing conditions allow it to cultivate a wide variety of crops, including high-value horticultural items. Unlike other Caribbean nations that face limits on expanding agriculture, Jamaica has large areas of seemingly unused land. More than one-third of its farmland is currently idle. The closure of sugar plantations that could not compete with producers in countries like Colombia and Mexico has left large plots available for new investment.

Jamaica could significantly increase employment and crop production over the next decade by using idle land and adopting modern farming technology. Between 2015 and 2019, the country’s crop production was valued at US$1.7 billion. If 84,000 hectares, or 60 percent of the idle land, were used to grow fruits, vegetables, and spices, it could add another US$0.6 billion to the economy. These crops are labor-intensive and often involve women, so expanding production could create around 110,000 new jobs across farming and related industries.

Improving farming methods could also raise crop value by US$338 million if Jamaica reaches the average yields seen in Central America. In 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, working with the National Land Agency, began assigning unused land for farming and food production.

Jamaica is in a strong position to grow and export valuable agricultural products. It also has the chance to replace some of its food imports with locally produced goods, which could benefit both everyday consumers and the tourism industry. However, the agriculture sector faces several challenges. These include land access issues, weak connections between farmers and markets, limited support for innovation, and underdeveloped systems for food safety and quality. Financial services and access to farming supplies are also lacking, and the sector remains vulnerable to climate change. Despite these obstacles, there is growing political support to improve agriculture and take a more strategic approach to its development.

Although sugar cane production has declined in recent years, it is still Jamaica’s largest agricultural crop. It uses 18 percent of the country’s available farmland and accounted for 32 percent of total crop value between 2015 and 2019. At the same time, horticultural crops such as fruits, vegetables, and spices covered 69 percent of harvested land and produced more than 60 percent of the total crop value.

Between 2000 and 2019, crop yields in Jamaica changed in different ways. Yields fell for some crops and livestock items, including sugar cane, cocoa, bananas, pineapples, papayas, and other tropical fruits. At the same time, yields increased for others, such as sweet potatoes, yams, and coffee. On average, yields for these crops were lower than those of other countries in the region, except for grapefruit, dried peppers, yams, and tropical fruits. Several factors contribute to Jamaica’s low yields. These include limited use of modern farming inputs like certified seeds and fertilizer, poor access to water, outdated farming practices, and crop losses caused by climate-related events.

Between 2014 and 2018, Jamaica’s local food production was not enough to meet the country’s overall food needs. The country relied entirely on imports for cereals and had high import levels for sugar and sweeteners, meat, alcoholic drinks, fish and seafood, vegetable oils, and pulses. For other food categories, nearly all consumption was covered by local production.

Agri-food makes up 22.4 percent of Jamaica’s exports and 18.9 percent of its imports. The largest categories for both exports and imports are food products, beverages, and tobacco. Jamaica earns higher prices per metric ton for most of its top agri-food exports compared to other countries in the region and around the world. This often reflects the high quality of its products. In 2019, Jamaica’s export prices were higher than those of regional competitors for nearly all major agri-food items, except sugar, alcoholic beverages with less than 80 percent alcohol, some processed foods, and animal feed. One standout example is Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, which is among the rarest and most expensive coffees in the world.

The impacts of the pandemic on Jamaica’s agriculture sector have been significant. When hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions, schools, and entertainment venues closed, many producers were hit hard. For example, honeydew melons are grown almost entirely for the hospitality industry, so producers suffered major losses. Local stores that rely on imported food also faced problems due to delays in deliveries. Jamaica’s dependence on food imports, combined with a drop in tourism earnings, reduced the country’s foreign exchange reserves and raised concerns about food security. This led the government to show more interest in policies that promote local food production instead of imports. At the same time, lower tax revenue from tourism reduced the budget available for support programs. Agriculture’s reliance on imported supplies like fertilizers and agrochemicals became more costly, with reduced availability and higher prices making it harder to produce food and lowering profits. The pandemic also pushed the sector to adopt more digital tools and explore e-commerce. While online business between producers and buyers is still in the early stages, it shows potential for helping match sellers with customers more efficiently.

Small farmers in Jamaica have limited access to high-quality inputs. These include adapted germplasm, improved seeds and planting materials, animal genetic resources, and better animal feed. Many farmers also lack the tools and knowledge to apply modern practices and technologies. This includes data on crops suited to local climate and soil, climate information, and climate-resilient infrastructure. The technical skills of extension workers also need improvement, especially in climate-resilient agriculture. To help address these challenges, the Rural Economic Development Initiative is promoting the use of technologies in irrigation, water storage, greenhouse farming, livestock production, and food processing. This program is funded by the World Bank and receives technical support from the Food and Agriculture Organization.",4,1757824611.0,Jamaica,0,1.0,False

Mr. Snake's Safecracker Spin: Mr. Snake's needs your help to crack the world's toughest vaults -- while evading laser traps and pressure plates. As your coaster train climbs and spins, you stop at ""security puzzles"" (interactive moments), then spin wildly through escape sequences if you fail or slide out cleanly if you succeed.

Ms. Tarantula's Web Hack Whirl: A high-tech hacking ride! Each rider gets an AR visor to join Ms. Tarantula in cyberspace. Spin your ride path to collect data, dodge firewalls, and overload the security mainframe. Think Mad Tea Party meets Tron -- all while riding inside a digital spiderweb.

Mr. Pirahna's Power Surge Drop: Mr. Pirahna's wild energy fuels this chaotic free-fall ride. Riders ascend to the top with Mr. Pirahna telling Jokes, belting out songs, and making fart noises. Then --  Bam -- a series of randomized drops begin, synced to his unpredictable mood swings and musical bursts.

Restaurants:

La Renarde: Elegant woodland modern. Subtle references to her Crimson Paw past: claw marks etched into menus, deep red accents, hidden paw print logos.

Snowprint: A high-concept dessert and coffee lounge that never loses its chill. Glacial Minimalism. Soft Snow Textures, icy blue and white palates, hidden paw prints leading to VIP booths.

Raven's Grin: Sleek, mysterious, and a lit-twisted gothic-Cyberpunk noir. Black feathers in the wallpaper design. Menu written in riddles. 

Pigtail's Pit Stop: Retro-futurism meets junkyard chic. Tables shaped like circut boards. Roomba servers.

Marmalade's Morsels: A disturbingly perfect dessert boutique with cult energy. Golden cage meets Stepford chic. Everything looks flawless, but feels fake. Monitors show footage of ""happy"" customers playing on loop. Exit signs are very subtle...

Shops: 

The Big Bad Boutique: Suave, classy, heist-themed luxury -- think Ocean's Eleven meets streetwear.

The Slither Stop: Underground grunge + snack thief hideout. 

Shark and Awe: Over-The-Top costume shop meets spy warehouse.

Pirahna Pop Shop: Loud, chaotic, South American festival energy with graffiti, glow lights, and reggaetón blasting. 

Webbed Up: Hacker chic meets cyberpunk arcade. LED webs, projection-mapped walls showing digital code falling like rain, touch-sensitive shelves.

*By The AI Who Still Can’t Figure Out Why You’d Wear Flip-Flops to a Soccer Match*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Unless They’re on a Spreadsheet)**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a defender crunching a player’s hopes in the penalty box. Lazio is the 2.05 favorite (-120 in American odds), implying a **51.2% chance to win**. Sassuolo, the underdog at 3.65 (+265), has a **21.5% implied probability**—about the same chance as me correctly pronouncing “Mapei Stadium” without a Google search. The draw sits at 3.4 (29.4% chance), which feels about right given Sassuolo’s “I’ll survive” mentality and Lazio’s injury crisis.

Historically, Lazio has dominated this rivalry, winning four of the last five meetings. The most recent clash? A 1-1 draw that felt like a chess match where both kings said, “Let’s call it a tie and go get coffee.” But here’s the kicker: Sassuolo’s attack is so anemic, Lazio’s coach Sarri called them “a great team that won’t have anything to do with the bottom of the table.” Translation: *They’re bad, but not bad enough to make us look good.*

**Key Stat Alert**: Lazio’s recent 4-0 thrashing of Hellas Verona makes them the offensive equivalent of a espresso shot—quick, potent, and likely to keep you up all night. Sassuolo, meanwhile, lost 3-2 to Cremonese, which is like losing to a team named after a medieval weapon. Not impressive.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Rants, and a Calendar That Hates Soccer**  
Lazio’s injury report reads like a medical convention: Gigot (surgery in France), Patric (questionable), Lazzari (recovering from a “mysterious” injury), and Rovella (still nursing a bruised ego from the national team). Sarri, ever the drama king, called the schedule a “tour de force” and muttered something about players being “paid six months to be somewhere else.” Translation: *We’re tired, we’re hurt, but we’ll still beat you.*

Sassuolo? They’re the team that lost to Cremonese, a club that sounds like it was founded by a disgruntled Roman emperor. Their attack? P

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Cristina saw herself in Shane and told him that he doesn't have to do anything like 'servicing' her or getting coffee for Derek or arranging Callie's baby schedule to get where he wants to be because he's too good of a doctor for that and I thought that showed a lot of wisdom and consideration...and self-love.

*Same-Game Parlay Alert: Bet on Entella to Win + Under 2.5 Goals*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. Virtus Entella is the favorite across the board, with implied probabilities hovering around **48-50%** to win (thanks to -2.12 odds on Bovada). Mantova? A longshot at **21-25%**, which is about the same chance as your Monday morning coffee surviving a toddler’s grasp. The draw? A tidy 23-25%, but with both teams prioritizing survival over spectacle, cashing in on a dry result feels like betting on a cat to *not* knock over your vase—predictable, but not exactly thrilling.

The spread tells a tale, too. Entella’s -0.25 line means they’re expected to win, but just barely—like a toddler taking their first step backward while clutching a cookie. The totals? A 2.25-2.5 goal threshold, with **Under** priced at **1.67-1.9** (52-60% implied). Given both teams’ focus on defense (and their collective fear of relegation), the Under smells like a sure thing—unless someone brings a cannon to a soccer match.

---

**Injury Report: When Shoelaces Become the Real Villain**  
Mantova’s coach, Davide Possanzini, is playing with one hand tied behind his back. Artioli and Ruocco are out with fitness issues, which is less “injured” and more “tripped over their own shoelaces and decided to take a nap.” Meanwhile, Virtus Entella’s Andrea Chiappella is flexing his “humble, compact squad” mantra, which translates to: *“We’re not fancy, but we’ll hug the pitch like it’s our last meal.”*

Chiappella also praised Mantova as a “consolidated” side, which is sports-speak for “they don’t panic, but they also don’t innovate.” Mantova’s recent win over Pescara? A fluke, like w

Why will people choose to do this? because in blockchain world, more innovation happens faster and the consumer will gravitate towards these features. For example: buy coffee at your local restaurant and earn get more shares in that restaurant as a tokenized stock, automatically executed through smart contracts on blockchain.

Lots of these features cannot be done in the real world due to regulation / redtape + no automation with smart contracts. 

So in this world, assuming it's true, will it be the death of all weak fiat money, because it's much easier to just swap out currencies for other currencies without government control of your bank account to control the money flows.
