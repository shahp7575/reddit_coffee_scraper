I am a stay-at-home mother of two kiddos. They are homeschooled, which means I am with them roughly 327 hours a day. When I'm neglecting them, I like to chat with people, do a bit of reading, and binge-watch the odd TV show or two or billion. If you watch anything on Dropout TV, we are already friends. In previous iterations of my life, I played video games and went to trivia nights. I also had a few years of doing Dungeons & Dragons and other TTRPGs. I worked at coffee shops (mostly Sbux) for ten years. I like coffee and tea and anything warm and cozy.

times that's not how i want to raise our daughter.  he'll hit her for counting wrong, not doing what he asked immediately, not listening, i mean anything she does wrong and he's slapping her across the face.  is a PFA my only hope?  i dont want him to have unsupervised time with her bc im scared he would hurt her to get back at me for leaving.  i've tried divorcing him before but he made it difficult and now recently he's told me he would never give me the satisfaction of divorce.  i was trying to stay as long as i could to pay off CC debt and my car but i don't think i can take it anymore.  what do i do?  where do i go?  i cant stay in a hotel forever because now my cats are home with him (if he goes back home) and he also abuses them.  (he spins them around on the floor to make them dizzy to chases him around and catches them to hit them).  im not perfect, i've hit him back in self defense and now im scared that kinda screwed me over.  i dont think i'll have money for a lawyer because i know he would just drag this out.

1i4lz8z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4lz8z,I FINALLY DID IT!,"After many different trials, spread over quite a bit of time (I work 2 jobs, one being at a coffee shop so I don't really have the time nor the need to make espresso at home very often), I was finally able to get a recipe that worked for me. Don't mind the cup, I don't have any good latte cups now so I just used what I have. I'm more worried about getting it to taste good than I am getting it to look pretty, plus I had already tasted it before taking the pic.

I am very much a beginner and I have a very entry level machine (frossvt) with a pressurized basket and a Baratza ESP grinder. My shots kept coming out very sour even after I narrowed it down to the ideal grind size and couldn't figure it out, turns out I wasn't pulling the shots for long enough. I put 16g in and got about 38.5g out and it was perfect! Well, still not as good as the coffee shop I work at but I think it's as good as I'm gonna get with this machine and/or these beans. Also, I didn't have this scale until my wife got it for me for Christmas (I'm just now getting a chance to use it) and the scale I had before was way too big to fit under the machine so I had to do a lot of guesswork. Not ideal at all.

In the future I would like to upgrade to a Bambino Plus and get some non-pressurized baskets so I can really get it dialed in just right and I will also get a chance to experiment with some beans.

Also, for anyone wondering how I work at a coffee shop but don't know how to dial in espresso, it's because I work at Caribou Coffee and our espresso machines are super automatics and do everything for me. It's convenient but not helpful at all when it comes to learning how espresso works. I do have milk steaming down pretty well though.",2,1737247472.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I worked as a server for a large corporation for 3 years. I was known as hardworking and personal. I had lots of regulars who asked to sit with me, i got their numbers etc. I was never the best server on the leaderboard but I was always consistent and generally liked. The general manager changed around October of last year and his right hand woman was the only manager that i felt (without her saying anything to me directly) that she hated my guts. After the management change, suddenly i wasn't getting good shifts, like fridays or saturdays where the money is. I got very very sick in November 2024 and lost my voice. Because I couldn't call the restaurant and tell them I couldn't make it in tomorrow, I texted in the group chat full of 23ish servers and all 5 managers. I basically said hey, I realize that the managers have said once that it's against the rules to call off of work using the group chat, but I don't have the physical voice to call the restaurant, so someone please tell the appropriate manager. I was fired (by ghosting and being blocked on the group chat no less) for not calling the restaurant despite having extremely swollen vocal cords and being unable to speak. 2 managers and 6+ servers texted me telling me to go to the EEOC or HR because of the legality of the situation (being fired for being sick is technically legal here in Texas, but you could classify my no voice as a short term disability because I did not have a voice for over a month, which is a protected class. Also, I guess having a group chat where that group chat is the only source of vital information that you need for your job and making everyone join the group chat is i guess illegal too.. if I wasn't on the group chat I would miss information that would make me unable to do my job correctly such as menu or shirt changes or announcements for the company). I don't know whether this is legally true or not, but I do know there were 23+ people that could have saved my job that day. If one person would have told the appropriate manager who didn't check the group chat, I might have probably had my job and just been yelled at instead of fired. Plenty of people saw my group chat message and told me about how they saw it after I was fired. I'm so bitter about that. Now I'm on month 3 of unemployment. I can't get unemployment benefits because every time I apply they don't go through because technically I got fired for something I was technically ""warned about"", despite never receiving an official warning, and my employer can stop me from getting benefits.  Then I filed another time and some government guy called me and said I didn't file correctly, which I doubted but remained friendly and let him change all my stuff. Then it got denied because he changed all my stuff to the complete wrong companies. I've applied for 38 jobs so far. That's not a made up or estimate number. I have a speadsheet so I don't apply to the same place twice. 38 jobs. 3 months of unemployment. Like- literally some of my days I just spend getting dolled up and literally just WALKING INTO PLACES WITH MY RESUME and try and beg anyone to take me. Some days I cold call places and ask if they are hiring, even minimum wage jobs for teenagers. It's ridiculous and discouraging. And the reason why I hate my mom is that she's watched me work hard to find another job. She knows I got fired because of bs. She understands that I'm a hardworker. She knows that I am struggling to get unemployment benefits. And she's still charging me rent. She's been charging me rent since I was 21. Personally, I wouldn't charge my kids rent unless they weren't in college and/or I knew they weren't financially responsible. I make spreadsheets with budgeting and invested in stocks for crying out loud. The most irresponsible thing i do with my money is I'll occasionally get overpriced coffee. Personally, I would never charge a person going to college rent, especially knowing that college person also works and pays for all of their own stuff including tuition. I just couldn't do that. But I agreed when I turned 21, despite telling her that I felt like it was a little cruel, but I said I understood. My mom doesn't have a mortgage and has many side hussles to supplement her income. She also owns her own business and charges her customers (in my opinion) too low of an amount for the years of experience she has in the field. You'd think as experience goes up, prices go up. She hasn't raised her prices hardly ever. You could get her service cheaper at her place than you would 95% of other establishments around, even though she has 18+ years experience in that field. My mom also loves to claim me as a dependent on her taxes and say that I don't pay her rent so she pays less. That's good for her I guess, but that also means I pay more because the government thinks I live at my parents house for free. I obviously pay my side of the phone bill, car insurance, grocies etc also along with rent. I don't pay for health insurance but to be fair that's not saying much considering my copay is $105 starting for even just a regular pcp visit + they never pay any of the meds I need. After paying like 500+ dollars last year total for me being sick + some other visits, my mom tried to do the ""nice"" thing and upgrade our insurance to one that has $0 copay, but she either didn't read how it actually works or the insurance had dodgy fine print and as it turns out she paid for the higher quality one but its only a 0 copay when you go to ""tier 1"" doctors, which for us means going to the closest doctor 50 minutes away and with no availability. I know that insurances are terrible and it's probably their fault, but this just feeds the flame of my hatred right now for her. She says she wants me to be happy but she's actively putting me in extreme credit card debt so she can get her rent money that I just can't imagine she actually needs. She says she wants me to be happy but now I have a cold sore with no access to medication because I can't afford the copay. Now I have to cancel my interview with one of the only places that gave me one because I have a huge cold sore because I couldn't afford the doctors visit to get prescribed the medication that makes it disappear before it flairs up because I gave her all my money just to live unemployed. I can't afford otc medication for the cold sore either (although I wanted the prescription to stop it from forming at all). During Christmas she asked what I wanted for Christmas and I said money, and she scoffed and said no I want to get you real gifts. I said no i really need money im unemployed and she laughed at me. I got a couple of christmas cards from my grandparents and both of the cards had double the money that they normally gave me this year. I got so happy, and then I started crying because I realized I had to give all of that money to my mom to pay rent that month. My mom also ended up getting double the money from her dad so she said she spent 350ish dollars on a ""head spa"" treatment. She paid money I'd kill for for someone to massage her head for an hour and give her special oils. I felt really secrely happy when she came back upset because she said the girl who had her was terrible. The other day before my cold sore fully formed I cried for several hours in frustration and then I tried to sell my no no pictures online for money so I could afford to go to the doctor and get medication. I made 0 dollars for those who were curious. For those wondering, I've told her how much I'm in debt. She knows. Sometimes, though, she'll bring me home breakfast or pay for something for me. I feel like I have stockholm syndrome sometimes lol. Sometimes I feel guilty because maybe I'm spoiled or something. Maybe it's normal to charge your daughter rent even when they get fired for shit reasons. I think maybe I'm just a morality idealist... if I could just live in the real world and don't think about morals then I wouldn't be upset. Maybe it's not even immoral at all and I'm just spoiled or something. I have found since last week I've started to get mad over things that normally I'd brush off. An inconvenience call from someone would piss me off more than normal. My cat meowing doesn't set off my motherly urge, I'm just annoyed. I've started thinking about calling back places that denied my application after being initially interested and giving them my two sense on how interviews are a test to see how much and how fast a business can say bark and roll over and the interviewee will do it. There's been places who initially denied me, THEN REACHED OUT TO ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK THERE, then after I responded they ghosted me again. I don't even really know that what my previous employer did was actually illegal, but it still leave me bitter. All the people who saw my text and never said anything and then let me get fired leave me bitter. The government being so pretzely about unemployment benefits leaves me bitter. My mom laughing when I tell her my financial struggles leaves me bitter. I'm bitter. I don't see a way out. I withdrew from college just a month before I got fired because I kept telling a couple of managers on duty that I can't work friday mornings because I'm at school and then they scheduled me 4 friday mornings in a row. Every one of them I told someone and every week I would continue to get scheduled. I skipped class to work because I wanted to show my loyalty to the company and I didn't want anyone at work to be screwed over by my not being there. I ended up having to withdraw because I missed so much material and then got fired a month after that. Withdrawing and paying for classes I couldn't finish already caused me so much pain and embarrassment. I felt so stupid. And a few months before that, I lost one of my kittens. I still randomly think about her face and then I have to distract myself before going into a panic attack. I hate my life. I hate where my life is going. I hate the amount of people I know who now make me feel bitter. I hope I can feel better one day. But that won't be for a while.

If you actually read everything, you're a g. Even if I still feel not fully understood, maybe someone reading might be able to get a glimpse of a little bit of my soul. ",1,1737247392.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1i4lvwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1i4lvwe/he_left_after_he_falsely_accused_me_final_discard/,He left after he falsely accused me - final discard?,"Hey. So my pwBPD lives next door to me, that's how we first met back in November. Lovebombing etc, what an amazing guy, introduced me to substances, the whole nine yards
He first started showing warning signs in midDecember but I went away for a few days at Christmas so ofc when I got back there was lovebombing into the new year
This month, he's been hot/cold. First week, he was all over me. We binged shows together etc
Since then, we've met in the mornings for coffee - where he started having at least one other neighbor there every morning. We'd meet for dinner, just the two of us, and he'd be stone cold silent. If I asked what's up he claimed to have no idea what I'm on about
Sometimes he'd still be nice, but fleeting

Wednesday morning, he was super nice to me. That evening I saw him at the local pub, asked could I join, he took a long dramatic puff of his cigarette and said ""No"". Kinda confusing but alright. Instead I walked around the nearby forest, at one point near an entrance, I took a breather to smoke a cigarette. Noticed he was standing across the road, staring at me. Went to the top of the entrance to see what the heck was going on. His dog spotted me and started barking, dude stone cold blanked me so I walked away, while his friends (other neighbors) laughed at me
Messaged him to ask what's up. No reply.
Yesterday (Friday) afternoon, he finally replied. He told me he'd tell me what's up, to come outside where there's cameras as then I'd know I'd be safe (what?) only for him to barge into my house an exact minute later and storm up the stairs. Thankfully my housemates were both home at the time and were watching
He says ""you told (mutual male friend) that me and (mutual female friend) are fucking"" and then he left without another word, leaving us all super confused. The mutual friends in question are our pub mates, there's usually the four of us and they had also been super quiet recently

Turns out Wednesday of last week, I was trying to get a hold of pwBPD and the female friend. Asking them could I join them in the pub etc. All in my head about the recent hot/coldness pwBPD has been displaying. No reply from either. Went for a walk, to clear my head. Popped into the pub en route, and all three of them were there. Anxiety made me think I wasn't welcome to join, so I got a glass of water and left.
Walked by the river, still in my head. Figured I'd try contacting the male mutual friend to see if he had his phone on him and if I could join (I was also depressed af at this stage, the river looked very inviting and male friend says he's our friend but also our therapist so I wanted to see if I couldn't join could he at least help calm me down)

Text: ""What's up with pwBPD and female mutual friend? Guessing it's just a case of FMF not having her phone on her?""

Tried phoning him but he cancelled the phonecall. That's when it all got too much for me. Instead of hurting myself, I channeled all my pain into the glass and threw it into the field as hard as I could.

Apparently, male mutual friend took that text to mean that pwBPD and FMF were fucking (what? they were literally with him when I tried to call)
They got into a really big argument over the next few days. An argument I wasn't even aware of. No one told me anything about how he was misunderstanding the text until yesterday when pwBPD said I had said they were fucking, so I phoned FMF and was told it was about that text.

I explained thoroughly everything about the context of that text. They all already knew it was a tough night for me, as I've mentioned it to them in depth. FMF and her bf eventually seemed to understand it was a misunderstanding but to give them space while things blow over (fair)

pwBPD doesn't understand it at all. I've sent him four seperate in-depth texts explaining everything, how it made no sense for me to do that, how they completely misunderstood the text, how the bf probably just overthought stuff and not to be annoyed at him for it cause it's easy to get paranoid at the start of a new relationship etc
First reply to a message was ""cop on, you got caught, folks are being massively calm about this, don't tell mutual friends stuff you're better off dancing in a mine field""
Explained to him how I don't go to anyone about the stuff between me and him, let alone going to mutual friends (he's warned me a lot about that), how I didn't say to the bf that they were fucking, and again explained everything behind the context of that message. Also told him how much it's hurting me having to bring up a night they know was one of my lowest and taking an innocent text completely out of context. Also asked who are these folks he's on about? Has he been running his mouth about something I didn't even do? It's a very close knit neighborhood and he certainly has more influence here than I do
He replied with: ""You insinuated me and FMF were fucking. HOW FUCKIN DARE YOU TALK TO ME?!!!""
Explained once more that no I didn't insinuate anything, went back over the entire context and said that I've explained as much as I can, there's nothing else I can do about it now.
Haven't heard back

Is this a final discard, even though he's never discarded me before? Such a weird thing to abandon someone over, especially since he's now made my living situation a nightmare. I don't know who he's told I allegedly did that stuff to and he lives right next door

If he'll be back, how long and what should I expect? It's not like he's particularly short on supply around here though everyone else around here is either too well connected that they're not going to fall for his lovebombing phase or they don't seem vulnerable enough. They'll be friends but not super deep in love with him style friends
He ""brought me out of my shell"" so to speak, which he also did with the female mutual friend so probably he was lining us both up as potential supplies before FMF said she wasn't attracted to him and he set her up with his friend instead though they're still very close friends 
He's brought people out of their shells before, people who used hang around with him a lot one on one to the point the neighborhood thought they were his boyfriends, but they had all left before I moved in. He keeps in touch with two of them


The one good thing is that I'm going to the local pub on Monday, with a friend who's also gay (one of my housemates). He saw how pwBPD has been treating me and says I can hang out with him for a while which is beneficial to both of us as he didn't really know anyone around here.

We actually went to the pub together yesterday. pwBPD wasn't there but the mutual friend couple were (the girl did say hi to us, she's definitely not pissed so think she's doing damage control in her own relationship rn). Another neighbor was as well, who we talked to plenty so if he was told about the stuff he's definitely wise enough not to buy it. Small neighborhood so who knows if pwBPD found out we hung out together - two gay guys hanging out together, one of whom was attached to pwBPD's hip - news tends to travel fast

We'll be hanging around a lot this upcoming week. So if pwBPD was somehow trying to isolate me (he introduced me to the friend group, maybe he wanted me to then be cut off?) he hasn't succeeded in isolating me. Not going to lie though, while pwBPD hasn't been physically violent yet, I am worried about what he'll do if he sees me and my friend hanging out together

Interestingly, my friend did say that last week he was walking back to the shop and pwBPD called him over for a chat. So who knows if that was pwBPD trying to start a new supply. Thankfully, friend has already experienced his own BPD friendship so he knows the tricks. He also says he doesn't want to be friends with him (he's the only one around here who knows pwBPD has been abusive towards me - not violent) and hates how I've been treated

What are some popular venues or meet ups to meet a woman for a serious relationship or life partner? I have and not a club or bar guy and I never been the guy who talked to all the women at events and just went with my friends to get out the house.

Idk what to do. Im sick of being friend zoned or when I try to make an attempt it’s friends only while she’s pursing another guy.  Just over it. 

Why is so frustrated and difficult to meet genuine women who will like me for me and I don’t have to use pick up lines or pay for courses to get the woman you want to be with.  I refuse to pay for courses or advice from pick up artist. The apps aren’t legit and is making things more difficult. ",2,1737246763.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1i4lqou,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmoshRedditStories/comments/1i4lqou/sleepwalking_roommate_short_story/,Sleepwalking Roommate Short Story,"
First post on Reddit so not quite sure what to expect. I’m a huge Smosh fan and especially of the Reddit Stories. I listen to them on Spotify everyday at work. The other day I was listening the episode with KallMeKris as the special guest. I was listening to the story of the creepy sleepwalking roommate when I had the idea to turn that post into my own short story. I thought I would post it here in hopes of getting some feedback. I don’t write often and when I do it’s usually song lyrics of some sort, but wanted to try my hand at something different. It’s kind of a long read so thanks in advance to anyone who reads/reacts to it!


Today is the day. After months of searching, multiple meet ups, and several posts on Craigslist, Facebook, and various websites, I think I have found the perfect roommate. After my last roommate and his girlfriend decided to take things to the next level and get their own place,  I was left with a spare room and wasn’t exactly excited to learn my savings would be taking a dent having to take on all the bills alone. I’d love to live by myself but I can’t afford it at the moment being a college dropout and still owing on my student loans. I was never great at balancing a healthy work/social/school life and the pressure ended up getting to me and I even started losing sleep over the stress and my mental health started declining. So I dropped out and here I am, working at a local grocery store. I don’t mind the job and my coworkers are all pretty cool, but obviously the pay isn’t great, so I could use all the help I can get. All  this led me to posting looking for a new roommate and just when I thought about talking to my landlord and possibly terminating the lease and moving back home, I got a response on Craigslist. “Saw your post looking for a roommate and was hoping to meet up and talk about the possibility of me moving in.”. I messaged back and we set up a date and time to discuss everything over a cup of coffee. His name is Trent and We met for about an hour and discussed all the details and logistics of the lease. We discussed how much rent is, when it’s due each month, responsibilities around the house, etc. and all seemed to go pretty well so I offered him the room and he accepted. Fast forward a week to today and he’s moving in today. I’m honestly pretty excited and he seems like a pretty cool guy. We are both into sports, enjoy grabbing a drink at the bar a couple miles from the apartment, watch the same types of movies, and a also like to play video games so honestly, it seems like a pretty good fit. He just got here so I offered him to help move his stuff into the apartment and when we were done, I got us some pizza and beer to welcome him here. We threw on a movie, had a couple drinks, and just started winding down after a pretty long day. I was a little nervous after making the post but it seems like things are going to work out and I’m excited to have a possibly made a new friend out of all this as well. Over the next couple weeks, things seem to be going great! We’ve been hanging out a lot and it looks like I was just being nervous for nothing. One thing I did notice though is that Trent doesn’t really sleep that much. I tend to go to bed at around 11:30-12 each night and I have still been having a little trouble sleeping so I tend to wake up a couple times a night, and every time I do, I can still hear or see (if I leave my bedroom door open) the light from the tv in the living room and him either getting up to go to the fridge, bathroom, or whatever he’s doing, but if that’s his biggest flaw as a roommate, I can deal with that. It’s been about another 2 weeks and I’ve started to notice little things here and there that have made me a little curious but nothing that seems too far off. I’ve found some spices from the cupboard to the fridge, my shoes moved from by the front door to in the living room by the couch, and all the glasses in the kitchen flipped upside down. It’s a little weird but I don’t know some people have different “norms” so I just put everything back and moved on. The weird thing is this kept continuing over the next few days and after the 3rd time, I decided to ask him if there was a reason for doing this and his response was “dude, what are you talking about?” While laughing it off. I assume he’s just playing a “prank”, being a 22 year old just “messing with his bro”, so I laugh it off and go about my day. I like jokes as much as the next guy and it’s nothing too serious so no harm no foul. Things kind of took a weirder turn the other night. I woke up at around 3:30 am (as usual) and could hear what sounded like him sweeping the living room. Don’t get me wrong, I like that he’s helping with the house work, but that’s just seems like such an odd time to do it, but like I said before, he doesn’t really sleep and again, no harm no foul. The next day, we grabbed some beer and chips for the football game that was on later and during the game, I got a little excited after a crazy play and when I jumped up, the chips spilled. Not a big deal but when I couldn’t find the broom, I asked him what he did with it. He looks at me puzzled and said “I have no idea, it’s not in the kitchen?”. I say “well you were sweeping at like 3:30 this morning. I woke up and could hear you.” He tells me “dude I was asleep. I had a few too many and passed out in the couch.”. I kinda start to get a little annoyed and say “No, I definitely heard you, unless someone broke into our house and decided to sweep the room you were sleeping in.” He then kinda snapped back saying “dude I didn’t have the fucking broom. What are you on about?” That’s the first time I’ve heard him this hostile but we’ve also been drinking and I did get a little aggressive too so I figured maybe I’ll just talk to him about it in the morning. I sweep up the chips with my hand, toss it in the trash, and say I’m gonna head to bed. Im asleep and I hear what sounds like a faint scream coming from the living room, so I shoot out of bed and run down the hall to see him just standing there with the fridge open. After what happened earlier in the night, I’m already kind of pissed off so this just struck a nerve so I shout “DUDE WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?” No response. “HELLO?” and again no response. I say “just go to fucking bed it’s 4 am!” And head back to my bedroom. The next morning comes and he apologized for getting so heated with me so I decide to ask “what the hell was up with this morning?”. He says “what do you mean?” And I say “you screamed and when I came out here, you were standing at the fridge with the door open and wouldnt respond to anything I was saying.”. At this point, he looks confused and says “I don’t remember any of that, are you sure you weren’t dreaming?”. I say “no, the scream woke me up.” He doesn’t believe me but I know what I saw. I even asked if he has a possibly sleepwalking but he brushes it off saying he has “never had a history of sleepwalking” and brushes it off. Over the next few nights I decide to try and stay awake as long as I can and have my camera ready in hopes of catching him in the act, but everything seems normal so I ended up giving up. After about a week and everything seeming normal, I wake up at my normal time at about 3:30 to my door opening. I don’t move and decide to see what happens. It’s Trent just peeking his head in my door. All I can hear is the sounds of his heavy breathing. This continues for a few minutes until I pretend to turn over and go back to sleep. I then see the door quietly but rapidly shut. I’ve been losing even more sleep since then and I feel like I’m losing my mind. I can’t keep doing this. 2 days later and I wake up to hear a continuous thud and scraping coming from the corner of my room. I am really freaked out at this point, especially with everything that’s been happening, so I scramble to grab my phone and shine my flashlight. It’s Trent again. My bedroom is fairly large, so I can’t quite make out exactly what he’s doing, but I see him slowly slinking toward the door while staring directly at me, like he’s trying to see directly into my soul. As he’s leaving my room I hear the slight creak of my bedroom door then the “click” as the door finally latches shut. I’m confused and quite honestly terrified at this point. I can then hear his footsteps as the progress down the hall until the distinct sound of his metal springs of his mattress. It’s at this moment I no longer feel safe in my own bed. I decide as quickly and subtle as I can to leave. I don’t really have another place to go, especially at this hour, so I decide to just grab a few necessities and to drive to an empty church parking lot about a mile down the road. I’m confused, scared, and painfully tired, so I figure I’ll sleep a few hours in the truck and I’ll go back in the morning to figure everything out and what he was thinking. I wake up at around 8:30 and as little as I want to, I figure I should go home and talk to Trent. When I arrive home, I see that all of his belonging have been taken and there is no sign of him, almost as if he was never there. I look around my apartment at all my belongings to make sure nothing of mine was taken and all I am missing is the rug from the living room. I found quite odd, because who steals a rug, but with everything that’s happenedI am so out of it. My mind racing and heart still pounding as I try to piece together any sort of reasoning as to what he could have been doing, but I guess I will never know. All of this just seems like a bad nightmare. About a week goes by and no sign of Trent at all. I’ve went to the same bar we frequented at a couple times and there has been no sign of him and no one has seen him. After another couple days go by and I can’t seem to get the images of him leaning in the corner of my room and his dimly lit but emotionless stare out of my head. I’ve been trying to keep my mind busy. I haven’t had a drink since because with every sip and the deeper in I get, the more the thoughts are in the front of my mind. I’ve been rearranging all the furniture in the apartment to keep myself preoccupied. When I make it to my room, as I am moving a couple shelves around, I notice a heat vent n my floor slightly askew. As I lift the vent up, I see multiple Polaroid pictures. They are all of me sleeping. All labeled different dates and times. I feel a chill up my spine and my skin start to task. I debate calling the police but decide against it. I haven’t heard or seen Trent in almost 2 weeks so I just figured he had just left so I again just try to push all of this from my mind. After finish rearranging all the rooms, I have a few boxes that I decided to put into storage in the attic (random decorations, some clothing, etc.) and I start to notice an “off” smell. The closer I get the worse it becomes. I get to the stairs and at this point it just smells putrid, as if rotting meat had been left out in the summer heat. As I reach the top of the stairs, I see all of Trent’s belongings just sporadically spaced across the entire room which causes sheer confusion. I then see the rolled up rug that I had thought was taken by Trent conveniently placed behind a stack of boxes, with what appears to be a foot poking out of the end. Immediately my stomach sinks, my heart feels like it’s about to jump out of my chest, and I feel the same chills going up my spine that I did the day this whole mess started. I start slowly waking towards the rug and with each subtle step, the floorboard lets out slightest creak, adding to the already nightmarish induced anxiety. With each step the smell overtakes me. I want to stop, but it’s almost like I’m not even in control of my body anymore. As if I’m on some sort of autopilot and there’s something else controlling me completely. I reach the rug and my entire body is trembling. I reach for a conveniently placed pair of gardening gloves and unroll the rug. To my utter shock, I see that it’s Trent with a hole in the dead center of his chest and the rug drenched in his blood. A flurry of questions and emotions fill my head. How did this happen? How did he end up in my attic? How have I not noticed the smell before today? What do I do now? The room is spinning and I feel as if I’m about to pass out. As soon as I can gain even a semblance of my composure, I dash down the stairs to call 911. The cops show up and soon to follow a group of investigators to take a look at the scene and gather what evidence they can. As I’m talking to the police, I see what looks like the broken handle of the broom that had been missing for weeks now, being placed into an evidence bag. It had been sharpened to a point that there appears to be blood completely coating the tip. I can’t help but dissociating at this point. Answering what questions I can but I’m in my own world. After a short time, the police put handcuffs on me and bring me down to the station. I feel like my world is falling apart and I’m just so lost and confused. Once I’m at the station, the put in an interrogation room. 2 detectives walk in with a folder full of papers and the bag with the broken blood covered broom handle. They start asking me questions like “how would you describe your relationship?” and “where were you on the night of the murder?” (The date was the night I woke up to him in my room and I left in my truck). I answer all their questions exactly how I remember them but they say there are holes with my story. They tell me his time of death was at around 12 am (which doesn’t make sense because I saw him in my room at 3:30. They also say that neighbors heard loud crashing and a scream at around 11:30 and then shuffling and stomping up and downstairs at that 3:30 mark. After that they bring out the broken broom handle and say they found my finger prints on it but I explain that it is my every day broom so of course my prints would be on it. The biggest curveball and most confusing part was they bring out the pictures that I found in my heater vent. Before I even look at the pictures, I tell the detectives “I found those pictures the same night and he had been taking pictures of me while I sleep”. The detectives look puzzled and as they flip them over to show me. To my complete surprise, they are all pictures of Trent while he sleeps, with the same date and times I had previously seen. At this point I feel like I’m losing my mind. How could this all be happening? I’m questioning reality. It was at this moment the detectives tell me I’m being arrested and charged with first degree murder. My heart sinks, I can’t breathe, and I feel like my life is over. I can’t comprehend what is happening. I’m out back in cuffs and hauled me off to the county jail or “pre-trial detention” as they called it while awaiting my trial. 


*Three months later*

Well today is the day. After several months of awaiting my trial and discussions with my lawyer, they advised we try to plea not guilty because all my memories and confusion on my own behalf of the events leading up to that night, they believe I to have suffered from REM Sleep Disorder, basically meaning I was asleep the whole time and I was sleepwalking. They said this could also contribute to why I feel like I’m never sleeping and as to why all those things in my apartment kept getting rearranged and to why Trent never had any idea to what was going on. I fear that I may never know the exact truth but I do know now that my life as I knew it is over.",1,1737246760.0,SmoshRedditStories,0,1.0,False

I recently tried making **date nut bread** at home, and it turned out AMAZING! The sweetness of the dates, the crunch from the nuts, and the moist texture were just perfect. It’s super easy to make, even if you’re new to baking. Here’s the basic recipe:

**Ingredients**:

* 1 cup chopped dates
* 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts/pecans)
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup melted butter
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

**Steps**:

1. Soak the dates in hot water to soften them.
2. Mix dry and wet ingredients separately, then combine.
3. Fold in dates and nuts.
4. Bake at 350°F for 50–60 mins.

Here’s the fun part: You can add cinnamon, nutmeg, dried cranberries, or even chocolate chips to customize it! I love pairing a slice with cream cheese and coffee for breakfast. ☕

I met this man at the gym last summer and had good amount of interactions, with him usually initiating the conversations and he’d give me fist bumps when we see each other. A few weeks ago, we exchanged phone numbers, and the conversations have remained friendly. He kept asking me in person and in text for coffee. He didn’t mention it was a date, so to me it was more about getting to know each other casually, just as friends.

When we were planning for this coffee, I felt like I was doing most of the work in planning. I suggested the time, picked the café, and kept the conversation moving. He was responsive but didn’t contribute much to the decision-making. His involvement seemed passive, mostly agreeing to what I suggested rather than actively participating in the planning process. 

On the day of the coffee, he texted just little over an hour before the scheduled meeting time. I was almost done getting ready when he texted me. He explained the reason for the cancellation, it felt unclear and weak. It made me question his intentions and honesty, especially since things had seemed to be progressing in a positive direction.  He did apologize, but it didn’t feel very sincere. The way he approached rescheduling felt passive and vague. He didn’t suggest a specific time or take any initiative to make new plans. He left the decision up to me without much effort on his part to actually follow through. It came across as more of a casual remark than a real attempt to make plans.

My response to his text was clear and direct. I told him I was upset about the late notice and also felt inconsiderate for my time. I then said I wasn’t interested in rescheduling. His response felt dismissive and passive. Instead of taking responsibility or apologizing properly, he just accepted my decision without much emotion. It made it seem like he wasn’t really concerned about how his last-minute cancellation affected me.

He often started the texts and initiated conversations, both in person and by text, including asking to meet for coffee. I kept things friendly, but he took the lead. His text style was simple, using periods at the end of sentences, which makes his messages felt neutral and casual. Like he doesn’t add much emotion or detail to them.

He is older than me. It’s been a week since we last communicated. ",1,1737246347.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1i4lkhd,https://i.redd.it/weelddvzgude1.gif,Piper post down. Math incoming on Dennies to USD. With our one and only Dennie holder.,"


Lets use ramen as our basis to get a conversion rate between Dennies and US dollars, considering the price of ramen in New Eridu and Japan. (Why Japan? IDK)

Ramen price 1800 dennies 

Ramen price Japan (Average from various websites) 850 Yen

1 YEN = 2.11 Dennies (abbreviated now as DEN) (Going to round to 2 for simplicity)

.006 USD = 1 YEN

1 DEN = .0032 USD

Now for different calculations:

1 USD = 312 DEN
With that info we can kinda get a feel for New Eridu prices.

Ether plating agent: 16,000 DEN = 51.28 USD

Coffee: 2500 DEN = 8 USD

Why coffee is more expensive than a meal, I guess coff cafe is specialty coffee.

Anyways I think this is an ok value for Dennies in US dollars.

Also no more GOONER MATH for the moment, let's say I got told no lol.

Plus a side story.,"Hello my Brothers and Sisters in Christ. I have posted a few other times and have always received great insights and advice. This time it's not completely advice but curiosity as well.

What is your Churches tradition/understanding of ""God Mothers"" in Orthodox Christianity? Is it different amongst Orthodox Christian cultures? Russian, Greek, Serbian, Romanian. Please share your thoughts and knowledge.

My families spiritual Father and Confessor is the Church Father, at his request at Baptism. 

I know that Godmothers are typically older/more experienced ladies (not necessarily age wise) who are more knowledgeable about the Faith and life in general.  

Well I asked a wonderful lady to be my Godmother and she very excitedly said ""Yes"". 

Her background is she was born in Iraq, lived in Syria until moving to Canada. She's cradle Orthodox Christian and still has her baby baptism documents. 

She speaks 3 languages including English, Arabic and ""the language Jesus Christ spoke"".  I'm going to ask her more about that sometime. 

I first met her at the first Orthodox Christian Church I previously attended. (Long story but you can read my post history). It was a huge Romanian Church, an OCA Church. It was very ""gate keeping"". If you missed a class or Liturgy you had to start all over again (minimum 2 years of perfect attendance before considering Baptism).

I was super shy and was by myself. She invited me to sit down at coffee hour with herself, her sister (another wonderful lady) and their elderly Father. 

She started to invite me to come to the Church they typically attend, much smaller, but more friendly. Romanian Orthodox Christian Church of American Episcopate. 

A mutual friend had severe migraine problems and couldn't attend classes regularly at the OCA Church. She did attend Liturgy without missing much for 3 years but no Baptism. 

After talking to the Church Father of the smaller, friendlier Church, He Baptized her within months of attendance and said ""Nobody should be kept from the Sacraments because of illness"". 

He also teaches theology after the Liturgy Instead of having a class after dinner. Which works better for people with kids and health problems. (Other Church no kids allowed during class)

That's an entirely different subject/rant so I'll end this with the question.... 

When we meet at Church for pictures, is there any kind of document or papers to sign? I also want her to be my sons (8 year old) Godmother. What does that usually entail? 

Thank you for reading this long question.

Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, a few months ago, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct tapped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I'm starting to not quite care for this place. The bar or the city you take your pick. I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout free bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, deep woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a Cyprus tree enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. And if there are any out there then it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.


My phone rang. It was Harvey. He was the one who got me this shit gig, hey at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harvey had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harvey was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harvey called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harvey was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band.""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harvey, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It hadn't rained in about four days which was uncommon that time of year, that was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. Traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

""End County Maintenance.""  

Thud. The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 


I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.

I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

""No Trespassers KEEP OUT""

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, Cyprus, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Unoccasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a Cyprus hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, Cyprus, swamp, forest. Hardwood Cyprus swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big Cyprus's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stations. I peered inside seeing one of those wheeled stepladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" An about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room.""

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read “The Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,” with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 


Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a cru de ta platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until… silence.

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. ""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greets me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride, and my mind needed a stretch after the interview, if you could call it that, with Deb. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right engrossed by vegetation. To my left numerous old Florida pines. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered. I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail is 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized my footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or 4 feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala. I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 
My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced taking off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 

I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could—

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something else, but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about 20 miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 
Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""
There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind I attempted to send a message to Harvey: 
""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering Pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child.

At two in the morning, on a back county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most January's in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.
The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch that puppy into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

1i4lfk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWFL/comments/1i4lfk3/i_do_night_watch_at_a_wildlife_sanctuary_in_the/,I do night watch at a wildlife sanctuary in the Florida Everglades ,"I've lived in SWFL my whole life. Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, a few months ago, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct tapped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I'm starting to not quite care for this place. The bar or the city you take your pick. I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout free bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, deep woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a Cyprus tree enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. And if there are any out there then it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.


My phone rang. It was Harvey. He was the one who got me this shit gig, hey at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harvey had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harvey was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harvey called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harvey was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band.""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harvey, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It hadn't rained in about four days which was uncommon that time of year, that was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. Traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

""End County Maintenance.""  

Thud. The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 


I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.

I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

""No Trespassers KEEP OUT""

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, Cyprus, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Unoccasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a Cyprus hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, Cyprus, swamp, forest. Hardwood Cyprus swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big Cyprus's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stations. I peered inside seeing one of those wheeled stepladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" An about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room.""

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read “The Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,” with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 


Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a cru de ta platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until… silence.

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. ""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greets me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride, and my mind needed a stretch after the interview, if you could call it that, with Deb. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right engrossed by vegetation. To my left numerous old Florida pines. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered. I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail is 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized my footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or 4 feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala. I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 
My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced taking off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 

I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could—

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something else, but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about 20 miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 
Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""
There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind I attempted to send a message to Harvey: 
""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering Pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child.

At two in the morning, on a back county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most January's in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.
The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch that puppy into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

Me (M32) and my wife (F36) have been together since 2015 almost ten years. We had our son in 2018 and got married in December of 2023. 

In 2020 I began working for an events company that ran one major event per year. My wife would eventually come on board in 2021. I was so happy for her she loved her job and was incredibly capable. 

I suppose the problems started in March of 2022 we asked for a raise, our boss agreed but it wouldn’t come into effect until May four weeks before the event. That year went really well it was the company’s first ever event because of Covid and we were all on a high. But following this after two years working full time my hours were cut to between 5 -10 hours per week it was barely worth it! My wife’s on the other hand was cut from 39 per week to anywhere between 15 and 20. This meant we earned significantly less than we did before the raise and were seriously financially struggling.

I eventually got another job after two months of searching that was 45 mins away nothing long term but would keep us going. I advised her at this time to consider looking for a new role. I knew that eventually I would get something good. 

My contract eventually came to an end in my new role so I started freelancing for several months this actually didn’t do too badly and keep us going until I found a very secure job with decent pay which I’m still in now. During this time I came across two jobs for my wife she refused to interview or go for either. One of which was really frustrating, because it was a government job, 35 hours per week, WFH entitlement great pension scheme it would have more than doubled her pay and she had a very very good chance of getting it because they had asked for her to apply before the job was even advertised. This was around December 2022 - January 2023.

She didn’t want to go for it and remained loyal to her company. To be offered such an opportunity especially as she does not have a college education I thought was incredibly nieve. Now in 2023 I would do some freelancing for the events company nothing major but this is important as a freelancer I would have access to their ticket sales / gross sales within the company. 

In August of 2023 I could see things were not looking good for 2024. I seriously at this point advised my wife to look for a new role. This was important because in 2024 after our wedding in December of 2023 we agreed we would start saving for a mortgage and be mortgage ready by mid 2025! This meant both of us would need to be in a job for over a year per the local lending criteria here in our country. 

Also in our country unless you earn over 70 - 80k a year you cannot buy a home on a single income only the top 10% earn that much. Plus we live in rented accommodation which in our country at the moment is in crisis. Right now if we were to lose our home there are only 6 properties to rent in our county, none close to where we live now and all for double what we pay it would quite frankly ruin us. My wages alone would not cover us.

After our wedding in December 2023, we welcomed the new year 2024 I got straight down to saving while my wife waited for her hours to pick up before the 2024 event. As she was still struggling badly making her own ends meet still suffering from the reduced hours imposed on her two years previous. 

In March of 2024 3 months before the scheduled event I looked at the sales and it was very evident at this point this event would either not take place or it would be the last one. Either way I told her come the end of June she would not have a job. Meaning I gave her three months notice that at this point it wasn’t going to happen. She took my advice with a pinch of salt and put a little effort into applying for roles but didn’t take it seriously she was still giving it her all to make the 2024 event happen. 

Then the worst happened two weeks before the event was scheduled to happen it was called off and my wife lost her job. At this point I was incredibly upset, disappointed and angry. I sat down the day after and vented my criticism I told her this would put us out from buying a house for an entire year, I said she was stupid to put so much loyalty in them and seriously asked why she had not listened to me. I seriously regret my outburst but buying a home is incredibly important to me and my wife knows for years now that this has been one of my main goals for our relationship. One of the reasons we only have one child is because we wanted to buy a home and travel lots.


Following this my wife completely detached herself from me for three months during this time she wouldn’t really be home and she started up a friendship with a 17 year old girl that she adores. I’m happy for her that she has a good friend. This girl has had a tough life and my wife is an incredibly empathetic women she does everything she can to support her to the point she goes to her house and basically home schools her every day, brings her everywhere, brought her on a trip away last September. Does practically everything with this girl but her life with her and me are completely separate despite her spending most of every day with her I’ve meet her 5 - 6 times. In the last 8 months to give some context our son adores her as well.

On another note her previous boss who might I add was originally my friend and also one of my groomsmen at our wedding had gone through a messy breakup and now bankruptcy following the company closing down. In the weeks that followed he would ring her every week to meet up for coffee, go for spins in the car, once he invited her to a trip to the beach for a BBQ. My wife never went but it was odd he was technically my friend first and on all of these trips he never asked for me to go or rang me to do anything.

I sat down with my wife one evening to have a chat and said look I want to as a family cut him off! He has caused a lot of damage to our reputation with the company going under which it did my wife couldn’t answer her phone for two months because so many people were ringing her looking for money. 8 months later and people still ring looking for money! Plus I felt he was over stepping and it was making me feel uncomfortable. Plus I had already questioned her on is this why she wouldn’t leave the company I had asked her did she have a thing for him because he used to text her “love you’s” in our work WhatsApp group or directly. Which to be fair he sends to everyone I think I have a few of them from him myself. 

When she went on the trip with her family and new friend I had access to her Snapchat on her laptop and seen he was messaging her replying to her stories complimenting her clothes, and they made plans to meet for coffee when she got back. She said this is what she would always do she would agree to meet but never go. It wasn’t like they set dates times or location. But still this was wrong. 

Can I add in 9 years almost 10 of being together I never had reason to look. I never have this was the second time I had ever signed into one of her accounts both times happened after she lost her job and on both occasions I found stuff that was highly disrespectful to me I found her complaining about our marriage to her new friend. I found a long message from her stating how in love with my wife she was, I seen her calling my wife “baby”. I seen my wife snap her an inappropriate image of her with a towel half around her getting into the shower. There was an image of the two of them while on the trip and her new friend had her hand very close to her private tbh the photo looked like they were a couple. Her new friend had my wife saved in her phone as “My Woman” Can I add my wife has gone into my phone and deleted these without me knowing.

One of her oldest friends was telling her that I am a manipulator and that she should find someone new. She also sent my wife a women’s helpline abuse number. Which to me is madness I have never once abused my wife I love her she is my world. I grew up in an abusive house I swore that I would never be that man. 

It hurts me that this friend is her best friend and someone I actually considered a good friend. Me and my wife are godparents to one of her children for god sake she knows me very well. It annoys me that this girl is still in our circle my wife wanted to get a matching tattoo with her. Yet In a previous situation a friend of my sister called my wife a bully and I never spoke to him for 6 years and my wife would get very angry when my sister would speak to this him. 

Following her returning from the trip I had it out with her and we came back together we found a resolve for everything bar her friend who called me a manipulator and an abuser. She told me she would do anything to regain my trust. 

Back to her new friend my wife now a days drops me to work at 9am goes to her house and stays there until it’s time to pick our son up at 1PM goes back to her house and then picks me up at 5:30 at this point she then heads home I go to the gym and am usually home at 8 my wife then has spent the two hours cleaning and cooking which I am immensely grateful for! 

Sometimes when I get back from the gym she will go out to meet her new friend again for a walk and be back around ten as my wife has done it weekdays are for her and her new friend, the weekends are for family. Which has never been the case in our relationship before. This tbh is incredibly odd seen as my wife would always complain when she didn’t get enough time from me when I was juggling college and working. 

All the while my wife still hasn’t found a new job. I exhausted all of my savings I worked very hard to save to support her while she waited on government benefits, I have paid for 90% of everything in the last 8 months and I don’t know where my life is now going In that same time I started applying for better jobs and I got two offers. Meanwhile my wife hasn’t even been called for an interview yet. She has applied for lots of jobs but I don’t know what’s going on. I feel like her priority is supporting this new girl who is in her life.


I had put a lot aside over the last few months but it all came out again two weeks ago I found it very hard to get over how much time she puts into her new friend and her friend who called me an abuser. on the 6th of January I unloaded on my wife for two evenings, I questioned her commitment to our relationship goals. I told her I feel like this new friend is as important to her as me and our son. This week in particular she has barely spoken to me and almost every time we have spoken we end up fighting. I’m incredibly depressed at this point to the point that yesterday I had a plan to kill myself and would have gone through with it had it not been for a therapist that rang me to do an assessment on me for counselling. 

Because of my situation the therapist had to ring my wife yesterday to let her know I had a plan and today I’ve spent the day comforting her and listening to the reasons why I have put her in the worst depression since she had post partum depression. While I’ve spent the last two weeks apologising for my outburst and apologising for not getting over what I found on her Snapchat. She said she has done nothing wrong. 

It’s gotten to a point that she says I’m trying to make her feel bad because I send her a message every week or two letting her know what bills I have paid. I do this to keep her in the loop and let her know I’m on top of things. She receives government benefits 230 a week I think. The only bill she has to pay which is 70 has been in arrears twice since she lost her job the second time I found out when we were sent a bill for 200 two weeks before Christmas! This bill is important because we get a subsidy for our rent from the government if this 70 is not paid to the local authority every week we could lose that subsidy. It’s the only bill she has to pay I pay everything else which takes 60 - 80% of my 570 per week pay check depending on what needs to be paid each week. 

She has also said I’ve effected our son for having two mental breakdowns following what I found on her phone I was on my own with him in the house and I couldn’t stop myself from crying she said I was wrong for doing that because he asks all the time if I’m okay. 

We had a holiday booked with our family this March to the canary’s I’ve always wanted to go but due to our finances we had to cancel it. My wife complained that she could of made it work so yesterday as a last gift to them both because I thought I would be dead I took out a loan and paid for there flights and sent her enough money to pay for accommodation and some spending money. Today my wife is complaining to me that I shouldn’t have done that because I would be giving out to her if she took out a loan. Even though I had told her the only way we could make it work is if I didn’t go and I took out a loan to do it. 

This week we had a massive fight in the kitchen and I panicked because every time we have a fight my wife wants to leave but this always ends up unresolved so when she tried to leave the kitchen I would put out my hands to stop her or block her path I’m incredibly ashamed of myself for that. I have apologised multiple times to her and promised this would not happen again but she said ya that’s what x said her ex who used to beat her and do awful things to her. 

I have reached out for therapy and am working on myself but my wife said she told me to do that months ago. 

At this point all I want is for things to go back to how they were before she lost her job honestly we had the best relationship in the world she is the only women I have ever truly loved and I adore her I really really do not want to lose her.

Am I the Asshole?

1i4l3of,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1i4l3of/can_you_relate/,Can you relate?,"I wake up shortly after falling to sleep last night by sick kid telling me she's having nightmares. It's serious enough for her to hop into bed beside me, which she hasn't done for a while. That's when I realize she's having fever dreams and is burning up. But she's already fast asleep so I drop off too and sleep badly until she wakes me up a couple hours later telling me she's too dizzy to stand up.

I roll out of bed and fumble through the medicine cabinet for the ibuprofen. I give her one, take her temp, set a timer for 15, then sit down on the couch watching puppy videos with shared earbuds while we wait to see if the medicine is working. In 15 there's no change so I give her a Tylenol and wait for 15 more. 

The temp is down so I fall back into bed for another couple hours before I am repeatedly woken up by quiet kid and creative kid who have discovered snow falling and who are going in and out the front door which is on the other side of the wall from my bed. (Mental note: remind kids to use back door in the mornings).

I check on sick kid who is feeling better but must have homemade chicken noodle soup, not soup from the cans. I ask creative kid to pick up the snow pants and try to reign in the creativity that is spread all over the living room, blocking safe passage for the rest of us. Then I eat breakfast and make the soup. 

Next, I take ignored teen and pissed teen out for a lesson about driving in the snow. I had planned to have them each take a turn driving before I knew pissed teen has just started her period. I thought I was doing her a favor since she missed shopping with her friend (because she doesn't know how to drive on the snow) but I guess I wasn't.

When I get home I'm exhausted so I make some coffee but am so tired I end up laying down for a nap, mid-cup. After another hour of fitful sleep caused by the pounding headache, I'm feeling able to function again so I get up and grab the rest of the coffee. That's when I realize I was so tired, I forgot to put in fresh grounds and I'm drinking nothing but dark water and half and half.

I make fresh coffee but don't want to waste the half and half so I just dump it into what's left of the first cup. Ewww.

I don't have time to do anything else because now creative kid's friend is here to pick her up and it's time to drop quiet kid off at a birthday party and pissed teen off at her job. The ride is silent because quiet kid is usually quiet, except when she's going through the front door, and pissed kid is still pissed. 

After drop offs, I stop at a gas station because I desperately need to pee and finally get a cup of regular-strength coffee, which I immediately spill on my new white sweater. And here I am, still at the gas station, writing this in my van because no one can find me here and the coffee is warm and delicious. 

A couple more deep breaths and I'm off to pick up the prescriptions before checking back in with ignored teen and sick kid before going back to pick up quiet kid. And I'm just wondering.....

What is the best large standing desk? You might find yourself pondering this question if you’re tired of feeling like a pretzel after sitting for hours at your regular desk. Standing desks aren't just a trendy office fad; they have a universe of benefits! From boosting your energy levels to enhancing focus, switching between standing and sitting can work wonders for your productivity. Join me on this journey where we'll explore various options, personal experiences, and tips to help you select the perfect large standing desk that fits your needs like a glove.
  
  
## The Standing Desk Craze

The standing desk craze has taken over like the latest TikTok dance challenge, and honestly, I'm here for it. It seems like just yesterday when I was slouched over my traditional desk, feeling more like a pretzel than a productive human. A little survey revealed that nearly 60% of people have tried a standing desk, and I totally understand why—when you think about it, standing could be the key to banishing all those ‘can’t-find-my-motivation’ blues.

In my own journey, I stumbled into the world of standing desks after a particularly painful bout of backaches. Trying to get comfortable while sitting was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Switching to a standing desk was revolutionary! I felt more energetic, like a roasted marshmallow—golden brown and ready to take on the world! Plus, standing desks have been linked to lower risks of weight gain and even chronic diseases. Talk about a bonus!

Now, let’s get to the funny stuff. Remember the times when “sitting is the new smoking” was tossed around? Sitting made you feel like a sloth in a hammock. Standing, on the other hand, gets your blood pumping—like running from a surprise pop quiz! So, why not upgrade your work game? It might just turn your productivity up a notch—or ten.

## Key Features to Look For

When diving into the world of large standing desks, certain key features become essential to ensure you find the perfect fit—like a sock that doesn’t slide off your heel. First up is **height adjustability**. This feature allows you to switch between sitting and standing, and honestly, it’s like having a personal assistant who occasionally shouts, ""Hey! Stand up and stretch!"" It can help reduce back pain and keep you energized. If the desk only has a fixed height, you're basically inviting a giraffe to a party where everyone else is a turtle. Not cool.

Next, let’s chat about **surface area**. You want a space that accommodates your laptop, coffee mug (because caffeine is life), and maybe some snacks—after all, who doesn’t need a good ol' bag of chips at 3 PM? If the desk feels cramped, it’s like trying to juggle while riding a unicycle on a tightrope. Unsustainable, my friend.

Then there’s the **weight capacity**. Think of it as the desk’s way of flexing. If it can’t support your gear, you might find it sagging like an overstuffed sofa after Thanksgiving dinner. Choose one that can handle all your stuff—plus a few surprise books or knick-knacks. 

Lastly, let’s consider **design**. It's not just about looks; a well-designed desk can make you feel like a productivity ninja. If it’s visually appealing, you might be more inclined to use it, turning daily work into a mini celebration. So, keep these features in mind, and I promise your back will thank you later!

## Types of Large Standing Desks

When it comes to choosing the best large standing desk, the variety can feel like stepping into a candy store—only instead of sweets, you’re surrounded by desks that can rise and fall. So, what are the different types? Let’s break them down.

First up, we have electric standing desks. These beauties are the royalty of height adjustability. With just a press of a button, you can seamlessly transition from sitting to standing. It’s akin to having a personal elevator for your workspace—who wouldn’t want that? The downside? Well, if your power goes out, you might suddenly find yourself at an awkward height, needing a ladder to adjust!

Then there are manual desks. If you enjoy a good workout while you work, cranking a manual desk up and down will keep you fit! Just imagine this: you’re in the middle of an intense brainstorming session and suddenly, you have to wrestle with this crank like it's a stubborn jar lid. It can be quite the balancing act, both physically and mentally. But hey, they’re often more affordable and never need charging. 

Finally, there are hybrid desks, combining the ease of electric with the manual touch. You can have the best of both worlds! It’s like living in a house with a trampoline and a swimming pool—fun and functional!

Each type of desk has its quirks. Choosing the right one hinges on what fits your lifestyle best—effortlessness or a little sweat equity. The right desk is waiting for you; it just might be doing a little dance between standing and sitting!

## Setting Up Your Ideal Workspace

Setting up your ideal workspace with a standing desk can feel like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. Seriously! Like, one minute you think you've got it all arranged perfectly, and then you go to reach for your coffee cup, and—bam!—you're elbowing your monitors off the desk. It’s chaos. 

First things first, monitor height is key. Your monitor should be at eye level. If it’s too low, you’ll be doing a weird impersonation of a turtle peeking into its shell. Not cute. For most people, that means the top of the screen should be at or just below eye level. Then there’s keyboard placement. It should be at elbow height when you’re standing. I learned this the hard way after I ended up with the keyboard slammed into my midriff because it was too low. Believe me, not a fan of the unexpected “Shinobi Ninja key-boarding” move I invented.

And let’s not forget about room to breathe {or, you know, do jumping jacks}. You should have enough space around you to stretch those legs. Trust me, you don’t want to be that person who accidentally takes out the potted plant during a hasty turn. So take a sec to arrange everything to give you that zen workspace that encourages comfort and productivity. Your back will thank you!

## Experiences and Tips from the Field

The first time I stood at my large desk, I felt like I was about to conquer the world—or at least my to-do list. But let me tell you, standing all day isn’t as glamorous as it sounds. There I was, feeling all energetic and productive until my feet began to mutiny. Yes, fatigue set in like a grumpy cat refusing to move from its sunny spot. 

To tackle this issue, I discovered the magic of switching positions. It’s like dancing in your living room: one minute you’re grooving to your favorite song, and the next, you’re in a complete freeze because you need a breather. So, I started alternating between standing and sitting. I also found anti-fatigue mats—not the ones that make you feel like you’re standing on a marshmallow, but those that actually provide support. Trust me, standing on a hard surface feels like a boxing match for your feet.

Another game-changer was incorporating movement throughout my day. A little shimmy while answering emails or doing the “happy feet” dance every hour worked wonders! Plus, I’d often challenge myself with mini-breaks: a quick stroll around the house or a few stretches. Not only does it boost my creativity, but it keeps those pesky aches away. 

So, if you’re diving into the standing desk world, remember to dance a little, switch it up, and treat your feet like royalty! Your body will thank you, and who knows? You might just find your productivity soaring.

## Making the Right Choice

Choosing the right large standing desk can feel a bit like picking toppings for your pizza—everyone has their favorites, and it’s a serious business! Imagine this: you’re at the store, overwhelmed by all the desk options. It’s like being a kid in a candy shop, but instead of colorful candies, it’s adjustable heights, motorized lifts, and those cool little cable management systems. Yeah, it’s a blast.

One of the best steps is to actually test out the desk if you can. Sitting down and then standing up again might sound simple, but trust me, it'll help you feel which height works best for you. Think of it as a mini workout, who doesn’t love a good stretch? When you’re standing there, check if there’s enough surface space for your gadgets. You don’t want your snacks mixed in with your laptop—unless you're into multitasking that way.

Now, let’s talk dough. Your budget is important. A pricier desk often comes with features like sturdiness or extra pockets for pens, which means fewer sad pens rolling off the table. Remember, though, it’s about long-term investment too! A good standing desk can last many years, so don’t skimp too much unless you want to replace it next week. 

So, ready to embrace this change? A standing desk could give you a healthier, more productive work life. Now go get that desk, and make your workspace the envy of your Zoom buddies!

## Conclusions
  
  
In summary, choosing the right large standing desk is about balancing comfort, functionality, and aesthetics. We’ve dived into key features, examined various types, and discussed personal experiences to help you in your quest. Remember, the best desk aligns with your work habits and enhances your productivity while keeping you comfortable. Don't forget to consider height adjustability, surface area, and add-ons that suit your work style. Take the plunge into the standing desk world, and who knows? You might just discover a new way to work that leaves you standing tall and thriving!",1,1737244842.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False
1i4l303,https://www.reddit.com/r/Azurlanefanfics/comments/1i4l303/siren_thesis_part_23_family/,Siren Thesis. Part 23- Family ,"Summary:

Doctor Bethencourt and Song, the wisdom cube-born girl, are preparing for a small trip to the civilian side of the island in which the Azur Lane's base resides in. The Doctor seems to have his own plans and reasons for the trip, but so does Song, which has been looking for an opportunity to get closer to some of the Kansen at the base.

[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/Azurlanefanfics/comments/1hzehh1/siren_thesis_part_22_waltz_on_azure_lanes/) \-

////

Doctor Bethencourt had spent the better part of two days running tests on the siren machines he brought with him from his facility. While accompanied by the Azur Lane personnel, doing something he enjoyed, namely showcase his creations and discoveries, it was obvious for those present that the repetitiveness of the tests had started getting to him.

Truth be told, while interacting with the personnel as well as a few of the more research oriented Kansen, he suddenly had some interesting insights on what actual -nurture against nature- would look like in a more scientific oriented scenario.

*An interesting idea for some future experiments.*

His mind had been preoccupied with such ideas that he was actually caught by surprise when one of the girls at the base came and informed him that their trip to the city had been approved and was currently being arranged.

The city in question was located on the other side of the island where Azur Lane’s base was set on, providing lodging, necessities. Such necessities being either those that would be available at a small pharmacy, as well as those that would come from going to a mall, or even from visiting a small coffee shop in order to take a break, reading the Saturday morning press, sensationalizing news and comic strips included.

The city offered more than anything a solid foundation of “normalcy” to the inhabitants of the island, including both those that belonged to some military or governmental faction that offered support to Azur Lane.

As such, the sense of normalcy only came from the fact that the city functioned pretty much the same way as an ordinary city would do so. Similar to any city with a big military base, with the exemption of how many people dressed in uniform was casually strolling the streets, as well as the not too uncommon sight of Kansen merrily going their way on attires that were more often than not, hardly proper, if one was inclined on being generous on the description or their choice of clothing.

The trip to the city was, in itself, something the Doctor had wished for Song to experience. Thus, the very next morning he had woken up the girl with the intent to visit the place. He had immediately started describing all of the possibilities of what could be found, as well as what she was meant to do in the case of an emergency or should they, for whatever reason, begin their plans much earlier than anticipated.

 

“ *<All those plans, all those warnings. And somehow the very first thing we did after waking up before the first light is to move to a city. Just to grab a pastry and some coffee?>* ” The little girl questioned, speaking in Irisean, as they were wont to do when they were alone.

“ *<Well these are not any regular pastries. Dunkerque praised these highly. It would have been a real tragedy had we not come to try these out.>* ” Doctor Bethencourt replied as he took another bite of the delish apple, viennoiserie, and sugar-cinnamon-crust concoction.

For her part, Song could only raise an eyebrow at that, it was true that the pastry was among the best she had tried since they had arrived to Azur Lane, but even if it had been the best, somehow being a better confection than those that Dunkerque usually prepared, she was certain that the purpose of their trip wasn’t focused on food and niceties.

“ *<I don’t quite understand what our purpose here is>* ” She finally said as she took a bite of her own pastry.

“ *<Well, to start a great day with some delectable baked goods and good cup of coffee, obviously>* ”

“ *<I-… you are not going to give me a straight answer about this, aren't you?>* ” The little girl narrowed her eyes as she looked at the doctor.

“ *<Not likely, no.>* ” The doctor said before taking another sip of his coffee.

This answer brought a wry smile from Foch, the only other person among those accompanying them that could fluently speak Irisean. While she hadn’t participated in the conversation, she was standing rather close to them, playing the part of a bodyguard. Knowing that there was someone else that could understand what they were speaking about made Song feel a little bit more uncomfortable than she was willing to admit. That as well as the Doctor’s subtle gesture that this particular Kansen was more than likely a spy of sorts, made her all more uncomfortable than she could bear, scheming and intrigue were the doctor’s forte, not hers. 

Feeling that their options for safe topics of conversation were reduced by this, Song decided she might as well concede and continue with whatever plan the Doctor had come up with.

With their “battle of wits” coming to an end, with Doctor Bethencourt sipping his coffee and Song begrudgingly eating her pastry with an obvious pout to her mouth, they quickly wrapped things up at that place, promptly joined by others. Among those accompanying them were a handful of Kansen as well as regular human personnel from the Azur Lane base. They got onto one of their service vehicles that had been assigned to them and made their way onto their next destination.

It didn’t take them long to reach the main destination, a shopping mall set in the middle of the civilian side of the island. The way the doctor had explained things to Song, it sounded like he intended for her to experience yet another facet of civilian life, and come to a better understanding of what the lives of the regular people were like. Somehow, he planned to achieve this sort of insight by having her come on a shopping trip, which she found highly unlikely. Then again, the Doctor had brought many unlikely plans to fruition before, as such Song was willing to at least give him the benefit of the doubt.

 

As they stood in front of the parking lot, at the entrance to the shopping mall, Song made a quick recount of those that were accompanying them. From their own “camp” those present were Doctor Bethencourt as well as Doctor Soriz, who had been mostly unseen while in Azur lane, the female scientist quickly excusing herself from any sort of “social” arrangement made by the commander or the Kansen at the base, by engaging in either work or her own choice of activities in which the Kansen and food more often than not took a big part in.

From the Saruka Empire, Azuma had joined them. After their first day at Azur Lane in which she had more than likely made her way to the Sakuran dorms, very likely in order to share her findings regarding Song, the Sakuran lady had made herself rather persistent in her presence in any sort of impromptu event in which Song had been present. Song couldn’t fault her for it, there was a certain mutual sense of comradery from both of them, with both of them having been given a life and a mission, with barely any real history to back up their existence.

Avrora, from the northern parliament had joined them too. Which was in itself somewhat of a surprise, as they had very little interaction with their faction before. Both her predictions, as well as the Doctor’s didn’t really include any real meddling from the Northern Parliament. With the faction holding a rather inclusive focus on any event, if not too self-centered perhaps. Avrora’s insistence in participating in this trip had come as a real surprise. Not that Doctor Bethencourt hadn’t anticipated such a possibility, he had very briefly displayed that amused smirk of his, showing that such events were unlikely but not wholly unexpected.

Foch, from the Reformed Iris orthodoxy, more likely than not, assigned to this trip by her superiors, either by Richelieu or Clemenceau.

And last, but not least in importance, Bismarck and Mainz, from the Reformed Iron Blood. Both accompanying them as well as functioning like bodyguards. Which then again could be said about all the Kansen present, as well as the human personnel from Azur Lane, which were more than likely some sort of special forces from their country of origin, at the very least.

All of them were wearing some sort of casual clothes, which did wonders to blend with the people in the mall, at least on a more natural sort of way, as the Kansen seemed to draw attention regardless of their choice of attire, more than likely due to their stunning looks.

“Well here we are,” Doctor Bethencourt said as the group stood in front of the gates of the mall, with people passing by, some looking at them but most simply going their way into the building.

“Our main objective is to check on basic necessities, at least on paper. The real purpose of this trip is to enjoy ourselves and waltz around the place.”

Song couldn’t help but roll her eyes at those instructions. Those were some rather vague rough strokes about what could be done as well as the Doctor’s usual tendency to be dramatically cryptic.

Nevertheless everyone just took his words at face value, with many of them nodding in agreement and soon began talking among themselves about what they wanted to do or which options were available within the mall.

 

To Song’s surprise the mall was much more than what she had initially expected, all the information she had looked at up within the network had showed her countless pictures of various malls, while she had focused mostly on those from within the Eagle Union, there was nonetheless a multinational arrangement present, as a result of the island being the base of operations of Azur Lane, meaning that there were various influences on the stores, the variety of goods offered, as well as the people present, giving as a result a much more colorful scene than what she had initially expected.

Then again, with Azur Lane being primarily managed by the Eagle Union, she expected much more fishing and hunting shops, as well as a cartoonish beaver offering a plethora of barbecue-oriented foods roaming around the place.

Her inner musings had quickly come to a halt when she realized they were standing in front of a clothing store with mannequins displaying various arrangements of children's clothes.

“Eh?!” Song was taken aback when she saw two hands extending towards her.

Azuma as well as Avrora stood in front of her, each one at a different side, obviously inviting her to come along with them to the store. The gesture wasn’t lost to Song, she had seen it several times while browsing the network regarding stuff like family trips as well as shopping, the fact that every Kansen had come to the trip in regular clothes, rather than their usual attires, had made this scene look so much more like those in the videos she had seen. But seeing it in front of her had been a whole new experience. Even if she had no real interest in acquiring new clothes, the invitation on its own had been something she hadn’t experienced before. As such, before she even had time to fully process the implications of going into a clothing store the with two doting Kansen, she found herself extending her own hands and holding those of Avrora and Azuma, she focused much more on that particular moment, before she could fully realize that she was being lead into the store.

Probably one hour later, although Song’s sense of time had told her it had been more, and she felt like it had been many more, the two Kansen had gone through every option they had laid their eyes on. Song for her part felt like she had undergone some sort of weird trial in which two aunts would dote all too hard on a kid they had met for the first time. She wasn’t quite sure if she had emerged victorious or not from that.

But at the very least she had obtained three sets of clothes that gave her a somewhat giddy feeling while she was wearing them. The commentary and praise she got from the two doting Kansen also helped her decide on which clothes to pick, truth be told. Azuma, especially, had become pretty immersed into detailing which styles could go along with which clothes and what sort of -feeling- could be ascertained from certain ensembles. Song wasn’t all too sure about any of those things, but she figured that if the others were sincere about this, then there was a grain of truth to what they were saying.

As such, she counted the whole ordeal as a somewhat of a victory.

Song couldn’t help but to notice that the girls playing the role of companions as well as bodyguards had decided to change groups. With Bismarck and Mainz coming back from their small trip along with Doctor Bethencourt. The two Ironblood ladies nodded towards Azuma and Avrora, with the latter now engaging in some small conversation with the Doctor. The former, now heading her way, with Mainz holding a cup of coffee, sniffing at it and twisting her nose as if unsure she agreed with the contents of the paper cup, standing at a reasonable distance from the bench where Song was sitting and now the leader of the Iron Blood was also taking a seat right beside her.

“I must say, this sort of trip is not a bad thing.” Bismarck said.

“It has been an interesting experience so far” Song nodded as she looked at the tall blonde sitting beside her.

“There is much more than we would need, if this was a regular trip for goods. But sights on themselves make for some sort of entertainment, as well as being informative on current trends.”

Song could only nod in agreement, she could see how every single store within the mall offered much less than a specialized store, markedly in terms of quality. Mainz would probably agree with such a statement as she still seemed in disagreement with her coffee.

“Anyway, what did you want to talk about?” Bismarck said as she turned to look at Song.

“Eh? How?!- I mean, what-”

“You have consistently asked for me, since the day you arrived. Not directly, but the insinuations haven’t passed unnoticed by others” She stated calmly.

“Was it Vestal?”

“It was Vestal” Bismarck replied.

Thinking about it, Song chagrined internally, realizing that it probably hadn’t been the most covert action to ask Vestal if the leader of the Iron Blood was seen often within the medical facility of the base.

*Well off with it then. Not going to waste such a fortuitous opportunity even if it comes as a result of my own inexperience.*

“I think there will be a point where either the Doctor or myself, will have to make a choice that neither of us will like.”

“Doctor Bethencourt might not look like it, but he is much more intelligent than he seems, he is also a schemer.The plans he has made, I am sure he will purposefully give the wrong impression to most people, or even unwittingly, but anyway his actions would surely immediately deem him a demon.” Song said as she bit at her lower lip.

“He is already capable of creating weapons that, back in a not too distant past, would have been more than enough to conquer the world. It only requires the wrong impression on someone for the Doctor to be immediately branded a villain”

“Mmmm… Can you share any of these plans?” Bismarck asked as she looked pensive.

“Not really.” Song said as she shook her head “I have only vague ideas about what his intentions are at best. But while I am uncertain of the nature of his plans, he is truly a genius, but he has a penchant for playing the part of the -dark hero-.”

Bismarck thought about the little girl’s words. She expected Song to breach a subject similar to this one, but she hadn’t given enough credit to the reports that she had read about the girl. Song was truly keener than the reports gave her credit for, her childish appearance most likely had given her much discredit in this regard. Although, her concerns were very much like those of a child concerned about their parent, without an inkling of what they could really do to be of assistance.

“Like a -Dark hero-, I see… I think I have come to a better understanding of what manner of issue you have” Bismarck said, calmly closing her eyes deep in thought.

“So, you have a solution for our problems?!” Song asked excitedly.

“No. Unfortunately there is no pre-made solution for such complex situations. But I have a suggestion.”

“Eh? What could this be about?”

“You don’t have to rush for a solution. You can take some time to process the events unfolding in front of you, even while they might seem completely immediate, there is always some time to make a rational decision. Open yourself with your family and make your concerns clear. You don’t need to come to a solution immediately. To be able to explain yourself and give yourself some time to process all the things happening is plenty enough. With your efforts combined on a single front, you stand a better chance of finding a solution that’s right for you and your family.”

“Eh? What are you?-” Song replied as she listened to the Iron Blood’s leader. “B-but I don’t have a family?”

In response to this, the leader of the Iron Blood raised an eyebrow as she looked straight at the child sitting beside her.

“Do you not consider the doctor your family? From what I have heard, the two of you are rather close.”

“We- I guess we could be called close. But- but I was created from wisdom cubes, I am not human, I am not related to him, not like a true family…” The little girl said as her head dipped marginally.

“Has doctor Bethencourt ever called you a -creation-? Or maybe something different, like ‘weapon’ or ‘prototype’? anything that makes it sound that you are not really human?” The Towering Leader of the Iron Blood asked as she tilted her head inquisitively.

“N-No! the Doctor has never!” The little girl stammered as she answered back in bewilderment over such a question “He has even found it hard to try and explain my existence, since he is forced to use words as ‘non-human being’ or ‘non-human organism’, which obviously bothers him. We… we often tease him about it…”

Bismarck hummed in response to that. She seemed pensive for a few moments before producing a silver pocket watch from her pants. She moved her thumb over the small accessory a few times before opening it, inclining it in such a way that Song would see it too, revealing that it was in fact a small compass.

“One day, both Herr Claus and Friedrich asked of me to go visit a certain town in the motherland. It was a weird request they made to me, and it was during a time in which I felt truly overwhelmed with both our work as well as the actions we had taken back then within the -Old Iron Blood-. So I went my way, hoping this was a mission that would at least distract me enough from my inner turmoil.”

“The place was a remote coastal town, with nothing seemingly of interest to it, nor remarkable enough that could have made two of the leaders of our reformed country to ask of me to visit it.There, I met a man who had been waiting for me to arrive. He had served on the Bismarck, the one made of steel, gunpowder, and national pride. He welcomed me as if he had found some long-lost family member, he gathered friends and family alike and made a small feast in my honor. He shared with me food as well as many stories of his comrades and his time in service during the old regimen. He seemed truly happy to see me, even during a time I couldn’t bear to see myself in the mirror.”

“He gave me this compass, which belonged to his mentor and friend within the Bismarck. He said I should use it to know how to return back to the town” Bismarck said as she chuckled, recalling that particular moment, offering the compass for Song to hold.

“I make a point to write to him every now and then, as well as visiting him, along with my sister, if we have the chance.”

“I think that was the intention of Herr Claus and Friedrich, to show me that there are others who wish me well and care for me as family, people who I want to be related to, even if it is not by blood”

“We cannot decide when or under which circumstances we are born into this world. But we do have the opportunity to decide who becomes part of our lives, and sometimes, we also have the opportunity to decide who becomes our family. Is that not one of those privileges granted to humans?”

“I think you and the Doctor share a very special bond. And I think you are already a family of sorts, even if it might not be apparent. He is already your guardian and your mentor, after all, is he not?”

For her part, Song held the little compass on her hands, she thought that it had much more weight than it should for such a little trinket. She stared intently at it while she pondered on the ideas shared by the Iron Blood’s leader, without taking her eyes off the little silver thing, as if it could give her a more definite answer as to why her heart seemed to be both aching as well as singing to her in boundless joy.",1,1737244812.0,Azurlanefanfics,0,1.0,False

1i4l15i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlexaPure/comments/1i4l15i/fixing_a_filter_that_wont_drip/,Fixing a Filter that Won't Drip,"When I first got my brand-new-in-the-packaging AlexaPure Pro filter, it refused to drip water. I couldn’t find much info online about how to fix a new filter that won't drip. So I thought I’d compile all the tips and tricks I learned in my quest to fix this in case it helps someone. These tips are drawn from my own experience, other customers, and customer service’s advice.

The main reasons why a filter doesn’t drip are:

1. There is a trapped water droplet and/or air pocket in the drip port (where the filtered water drips out). This small droplet dams up the filter and prevents water from flowing out.
2. High water tension (air bubbles in the water) are preventing the air from being purged from the filter. If air is trapped in your filter, water can’t get in.
3. There is a vacuum in the bottom chamber that is holding the water in the upper chamber. This will also cause water to flow out of the spigot on the bottom chamber slower.

To fix these issues, here are some things to try. I put the tricks that are easiest and work best for me near the top. I still do the top ones regularly since my filter still stops dripping pretty often. AlexaPure has a YouTube channel where they demo some of these.

1. To fix trapped water/air in the drip port, the easiest way I’ve found is to shake the entire upper chamber hard with the filter drip port pointing down until water starts dripping out again.
2. Try setting the entire upper chamber on a diagonal on top of the lower chamber (see this  [pic](https://imgur.com/a/QaSBTQX)). I think this works better if you angle it so the filter is at the lowest point. I can’t explain why this works; maybe it helps prevent water droplets from getting trapped in the drip port, or maybe having different water pressure on one side of the filter than the other helps it purge trapped air bubbles and suck water in. But it has helped me many times.
3. If the clog seems persistent, try holding the upper chamber above your head and sucking on the drip port while there is some water in the upper chamber. This sucks out any trapped water and air bubbles and sucks water into the filter to get it flowing again. Had I known about this trick sooner, it likely would have saved me *tons* of time and agony getting my new filter to work. To be sanitary about it, I got silicone tubing with a ½ inch inner diameter to use as a straw so my mouth does not touch the drip port.
4. Allow the upper chamber to empty almost completely before refilling it. Anytime I add water without allowing the upper chamber to empty completely, the filter clogs again. u/adroitus mentioned this in an earlier post too, and customer service said not to let excessive water stay in the upper chamber since that could create a vacuum. I think exposing the filter to air for a bit helps in the same way a dry sponge sucks in water much better than a wet one. (AlexaPure says not to let your filter dry out completely though; refill it at least every 3-5 days. I refill my filter system at least daily, so the filter is never out of water for more than a few hours).
5. Fill your top chamber completely full for every filtering run. At full capacity with 1 filter the AlexaPure Pro can filter about 1 gallon per hour (so at least 2 hours to filter a full tank). When the top chamber is filled, water pressure and gravity help push the water through the filter quickly. You will notice a slowdown as the top chamber’s water level decreases.
6. Some people recommend banging very hard on the side of the metal buckets with a wooden spoon whenever you fill the upper chamber to get the air bubbles to loosen and rise to the surface. This trick hasn’t worked for me, but has helped others.
7. I removed the aerator from my sink faucet. It only takes a couple minutes to remove and now I have non-aerated water to put in my AlexaPure. This might be helping to prevent excessive air bubbles in the water.
8. To prevent a vacuum from being created between the upper and lower chambers, wipe the area where the upper and lower chambers meet so it is completely dry. Try angling your upper chamber or rotating it until air can flow into the bottom chamber. Or stick something between the upper and lower chambers so they can’t vacuum-seal themselves together. Allowing airflow into the bottom chamber will also make water flow out of your spigot faster.
9. Scrub the outside of your filter. If your filter has been used a lot, there could be turbidity and sediment clogging the filter. Although my filter was new, I still scrubbed it in case there was manufacturing dust/excess carbon clogging the filter. Remove the filter from your system and scrub the outside of the filter with a ScotchBrite Pad or the rough side of a dish sponge. (Do not use your dirty, stanky, used dish sponge. Use a clean, new sponge designated only for scrubbing your filter). Do not use soap and make sure the drip port is facing down. Scrub firmly for 2-3 minutes.
10. The filter may have gotten too cold. Try running the filter under warm water for a few moments. Warm water has lower water tension than cold. So you can try using some lukewarm water in your upper chamber. Don’t go too hot, since that could damage your filter.
11. This fix is a pain so I would do it as a last resort. It might have been what fixed my new filter, although it didn’t work instantly. The filter may need to be re-primed to purge the air bubbles. Remove the filter from the unit and place the filter upside down in a large container of water with the drip port (tip) exposed to the air. Ensure that the rest of the filter is fully submerged in the water. Weigh the filter down as it will want to float (you can use coffee mugs as weights). Make sure that the opening of the drip port of the filter is not underwater. Do not allow water to enter the filter through the hole in the drip port. Wait 72 hours. Once the filter has soaked for the full 72 hours and it is full of water, it will be heavier. Install the filter into the upper canister. Fill the upper canister with 2.25 gallons of water as quickly as possible.
12. After trying nearly all of these tips with no immediate success, my filter miraculously started dripping steadily for the first time one night after sitting for several hours with the upper chamber full of water. So, you may just need to be patient and let your filter sit in some water.

After this week-long nightmare with getting my new filter to drip, here are some things I think people should consider before buying a gravity filter:

* Many of the tricks above require lots of clean, running water and even waiting 3 days to get your filter working. For that reason, I would never recommend relying solely on a gravity filter (especially a unused one) for clean water in an emergency or backcountry situation. I’m using my AlexaPure to filter city water. But there have been many attempts to unclog my filter that have resulted in unfiltered water getting in contact with the filter drip port or lower chamber accidentally. Had I been filtering river water or something, that would have been a huge problem.
* Your filter life will be shorter if you have soft water. The only place I found that info is in the manual for my AlexaPure. Berkey has the same issue apparently.
* Unless you buy your AlexaPure from one of their authorized retailers, AlexaPure will not replace parts that aren't working. It doesn’t matter if the lot number on your AlexaPure filter is authentic.
* After about a week or two of the filter working, I got some minor rust-like stains around the base of the upper chamber and the underside of the lid. Supposedly, these are chromium oxide stains and can be easily removed. I've had my filter system a while now and the chambers haven’t rusted through or anything, so I am not too worried.

Despite all this, I don't regret buying my AlexaPure. Would be nice if it dripped more reliably, though. I think they should make pump mechanisms you can attach to these if you want.",1,1737244668.0,AlexaPure,0,1.0,False

1i4kxcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1i4kxcn/am_i_being_stalked/,Am I being stalked?,"The context:

I'm a female in her 20s. I live in a safe neighborhood in midtown Toronto. I have somewhat a routine - I go to the gym several times a week and go to the grocery store afterwards. The gym and the grocery store are conveniently in the same building which is around 8 min walk away from where I live. 

At the beginning I really didn't think much of it. It wasn't until today that it made me feel quite uneasy.

Incident 1:

I was browsing in the grocery store when this guy approached me. He's tall, around my age, and has a non-threatening look. He wears a long black parka and nothing really stood out as odd. He complimented on my looks and asked if he could follow me on ig. Due to his friendly demeanor, I said sure. He was scrambling on his phone when I started to lose my patience a little and suggested him take a picture of my handle. He did and said thank you. I left.

I have a private account and get random follow requests all the time. I didn't approve anyone that I didn't know (including this guy).

Incident 2:  

I was browsing in the grocery store when someone lightly bumped into me from behind. I looked over. It was this guy. He said sorry. I said no worries and moved on. I recognized him and thought it was an accident. And my nonchalant behavior should be obvious that I was by no means interested.  

Incident 3:

I was browsing cheese in the grocery store. He walked directly towards me from behind. It was obvious because I was the only one looking at the section of the fridge. He turned his face towards me with intentions and I turned my face towards him. He opened his mouth and was just stuck for a second. Stuttering a little, he asked which section sold coffee... I don't work there and it was clear that the coffee section is far away because we were surrounded by fridges... I pointed him the right direction and he just walked towards there.

Incident 4:

Today I was browsing in the grocery store and it was quite empty. He walked past me in front of me several times... No excuse me, no words, just walking past. At this point I started to suspect something is wrong. Why is he always there when I shop? and why does he have to be around my personal vicinity when the store is quite empty? I was annoyed.

Well, at least he's not threatening, I thought.

I checked out and started to walk home as usual. 2 min into my walk, a guy clearly turned towards me on the street. I looked up.

It was him. At this point, I was not happy as these encounters seemed to escalate. I kept walking as he opened his mouth seemingly wanting to say something. Nothing came out as I looked away and just kept walking...

  
I had to look over my shoulders all the way home. It just feels wrong...

What's your take on the situation? What should I do?

She does not tell them about her stalker but gradually grows closer to (and less intimidated by) them. The book takes place in a city setting. The men are collectively wealthy from their business. She hasn’t been able to sustain a job to establish a financial base, as she has been on the run. This job is a life saver for her. 

I think I remember her picking up coffee and muffins for the office. Also possibly a scene where she hangs out in a surveillance room with one of the guys. 

It’s definitely a slow burn with a larger harem group.

My OW was my high school sweetheart separated by 15 years.

We broke up due to dumb kid reasons and both went and lived our own lives and grew as people for 15 years before randomly i got a call one day from her and we went and got coffee and just caught up and laughed for hours.

we started talking everyday and well one thing led to another and we were having the best sex of our life and i was instantly addicted as i had been in a Deadbedroom marriage for a few years at that point.

We met and fucked and laughed and went out and stayed with each other several times a month.

we did this for about two years until one day she said she just couldnt do it anymore and that we shouldn't ever speak again which she thought would be the best for both of us. So for the past two years we haven't said a word to each other.

1i4krq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1i4krq9/i_do_night_watch_at_a_wildlife_sanctuary_in_the/,I do night watch at a wildlife sanctuary in the Florida Everglades,"I've lived in SWFL my whole life. Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, a few months ago, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct tapped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I'm starting to not quite care for this place. The bar or the city you take your pick. I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout free bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, deep woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a Cyprus tree enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. And if there are any out there then it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.


My phone rang. It was Harvey. He was the one who got me this shit gig, hey at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harvey had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harvey was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harvey called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harvey was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band.""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harvey, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It hadn't rained in about four days which was uncommon that time of year, that was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. Traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

""End County Maintenance.""  

Thud. The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 


I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.

I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

""No Trespassers KEEP OUT""

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, Cyprus, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Unoccasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a Cyprus hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, Cyprus, swamp, forest. Hardwood Cyprus swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big Cyprus's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stations. I peered inside seeing one of those wheeled stepladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" An about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room.""

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read “The Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,” with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 


Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a cru de ta platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until… silence.

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. ""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greets me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride, and my mind needed a stretch after the interview, if you could call it that, with Deb. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right engrossed by vegetation. To my left numerous old Florida pines. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered. I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail is 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized my footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or 4 feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala. I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 
My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced taking off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 

I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could—

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something else, but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about 20 miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 
Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""
There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind I attempted to send a message to Harvey: 
""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering Pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child.

At two in the morning, on a back county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most January's in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.
The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch that puppy into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

My wife and I are planning on moving to the east coast and are looking for places to live. We spent a lot of time living in Europe (Netherlands) so we’re really looking for somewhere walkable. 

- Walkable to grocery stores, etc (Having a car is fine tho just want some decent convenience!)
- Parks are a must - or can be one larger park with easier access but needs to be easily accessed by walking. We walk about 90 minutes every day so this is huge for us. 
- Easy access to NYC, DC, Philadelphia, or Boston within 90-120 minutes (preferred if on a train line) for flights to Europe. 
- Somewhat affordable home prices we’re looking to buy. (Say sub 400k for a decent house, or townhome)
- Smaller towns (20k-500k) would be preferred 
- Bikable is a plus but not 100% needed. Dedicated bike lanes that are protected / have barriers would be preferred. 
- Vegan friendly is a plus
- Great coffee shops with real latte art is a plus

I wrote him a letter this morning and I wanted to share. I wrote it in Spanish, and translated with chatGPT, I hope it captures in English our relationship.

Baby, yesterday you left us, and I’m a wreck.

I saw this day as so far away, yet so close, that I was already talking about it to try to process what would happen: how the procedure would go, if you would suffer, if it would be quick. I called the cremation service. I talked about it as if it were inevitable, but I was still hopeful that it wouldn’t be so soon—that we would have a few more days together. We were going to try a new treatment to see if you felt better. I had already bought everything.

I had booked a communication session with you for January 22nd, and Mónica couldn’t do it until Monday.
And as cruel as destiny can be, and as wise as the universe is, yesterday, I woke up, and your glucose levels were almost normal—which meant you hadn’t eaten. I checked the cameras, and indeed, you hadn’t even gotten up. You didn’t want pâté. We syringe-fed you, but you didn’t care for it. You weren’t interested in Churu. You looked tired. You went to Martín’s bathroom mat and stayed there, staring at the wall with your head down. And that’s when I knew.

I didn’t know because of words I couldn’t hear, but by looking at you, I knew it was the day I had to make the greatest act of love for you: to let you rest with dignity so you wouldn’t suffer anymore. To stop the endless vet visits you had grown to hate, which I hated putting you through.

I already knew I didn’t want you to go through what you endured in September again, simply because your behavior at the vet wasn’t the same anymore. You became aggressive. We had to give you gabapentin beforehand. You pooped on the exam table. You growled nonstop, angry and defensive, and afterward, you were groggy for hours. I didn’t want that for you long-term, especially when the outlook wasn’t promising. Everything we had done together was no longer enough. There weren’t any more options, only this last treatment to try. But seeing you yesterday made me feel like you were telling me it was time. That you had reached the point where the roller coaster would only go downhill—fast—and I had to make a choice.

And I chose for it to be a little earlier, before it was too late and you suffered even more physically, emotionally, and from all the stress.

I wanted to wait until I could communicate with you and know your will. But the universe works this way, and I think it happened for a reason.

I hope I understood you correctly.

Thank you for giving me the most beautiful gift a week before, as if you knew, and I didn’t yet: you did everything I missed so much. You cuddled with Cumbi. You jumped onto the bed in one clean leap. You took naps with me, being the little spoon, crawled under the sheets, and purred so loudly.

Thank you, too, for waiting until Martín returned before feeling so bad again. One of my greatest fears was that you wouldn’t get to say goodbye to him. But you waited—you ate asado (barbacue) with him, cuddled with him, and I think it was your way of thanking him for the years you shared together.

Baby, your passing was surrounded by many “signs.”
We had a vet appointment with Mica at 5 PM. Afterward, we planned to bring your body back home so Cumbi could say goodbye, and then someone from the cremation service would come for you. But you started feeling much worse earlier. A vet who didn’t know you—and whom we didn’t know—had to come home at midday. Maybe you wanted to leave from home?

Your farewell was incredibly sad but also peaceful. Candles were lit to guide your way. The man who came was kind and respectful. The last thing you did was vomit—as if you wanted to leave us with your “show,” the one that froze us every time we heard it in some corner of the house.

Baby, it was just a second. I hope you didn’t suffer and felt the caresses that accompanied you until the end, feeling loved until your last moment on earth.

You left us at noon on January 17th, 2025, the same date as my Tata Julio, though many years later. It was a sunny, warm Friday—just how you liked them.

Your little body stayed with us for several hours on the living room floor. You were wrapped in your towels, and I placed a little flower sent by your grandparents and Flo. You were taken wrapped in a blanket, with a flower from the cremation service that had your name and the date. Martín added the little yellow flower you had before. They closed the box and took you away, with great respect, to return in another form in a few days.

Now I regret a little leaving you on the floor, but you liked lying on any surface with the slightest cushion to rest on.

Cumbi smelled you, then sat on the rug, watching you for a while. Later, she climbed onto the couch, and the two of you stayed alone in the living room for a bit. I hope she understood that you weren’t coming back and, like us, can hold onto all the beautiful moments you shared.

Baby, I hope that in these almost 15 years on this Earth, you knew how loved and cared for you were.
I hope you were incredibly happy because you made me so happy. You were the best nap companion, and I will always miss them. I’ll miss opening the fridge and seeing you come running, meowing for food. I’ll miss you jumping on the table to beg for food, knocking everything off my nightstand to wake me up and feed you—even when your bowl wasn’t empty. I’ll miss you sprawling on me when I watched TV, biting me and scowling when I touched your belly, your little ""mustache""  face, and your judging eyes. Your awful breath, your soft kisses, and the sound of your claws on the floor.

This morning at 7, I woke up and cried because we no longer have the “diabetic cat routine” at 8 am/pm. Yesterday, I asked Martín to turn off the alarm so I could sleep in. Yet, I woke up at 7, alone, made myself coffee, and at 7:45, my watch alarm buzzed to remind me to check your glucose—but you weren’t here anymore.

Thank you for letting me help you so much. You always cooperated with your glucose checks—you even came running when you heard the microwave. I’d sit on the floor, and you’d climb onto my lap and purr. You let me prick you, run curves, give you pills, syrups, injections.

Baby, I hope you understood that all those vet visits were for your well-being and don’t hate me for them. I’m sure the vets who treated you felt your passing. Mica even told me she would’ve liked to help you transcend because she got to know you so well. Unfortunately, she wasn't available until 5.

You taught me so much over the years—especially in these last ones. You taught me to overcome situations that paralyze me, to face fears, to move forward, and, above all, to read you and listen with my heart.

Just by looking at you, I’d know if something was wrong. If I observed a little longer, I’d figure out exactly what or what might happen next. I rain-checked many plans early because I felt something was going to be off with you—and each time, I was right.

I regret not catching the signs before September. But thank you for teaching me along the way.

You also taught me to trust myself and ignore outside opinions: “Stop changing your plans for the cat; nothing’s going to happen.” I regret nothing, baby. Every second spent with you strengthened our bond. I hope you know I moved heaven and earth for you—getting you brushes that wouldn’t hurt your back, heated and cooling beds, supplements, hard-to-find meds, elevated ceramic dishes. I would do it all over again, a thousand times, because it came from my heart.

I’m sorry for all the times you saw me cry, get angry, or curse. I hope you know it was never at you but at my frustration for not having a magic wand to make you better.

You were a true character, and sharing all these years with you was so much fun. I hope you’ve made it to kitty heaven, where Tito, Saeta, Frida, Roxy, Jagger, La Morocha, Simba, the birds, Pepito, Pinky, Catalina, the lambs, and chicks are waiting to greet you. May they welcome you with churus, cheese, endless yummy food, no vomit worries, warm beds, and sunny windows. I hope there’s always fresh water, clean litter, and that you never feel alone. And when you nap, I hope you imagine me there with you.

Watch over us from your new home, send me signs, and when the pain eases, send us the perfect kitty you’d choose for us—one Cumbi won’t hate.

Last night, Martín and I went out to toast to you because I think you would’ve wanted that. It wasn’t a big celebration, quite quiet because we were heartbroken, but we honored your journey and your life.

We plan to donate your “senior kitty kit” because your care was expensive (worth every penny), and many animals and their humans need help. I hope it makes you happy to know your farewell gift will help other pets have a better life.

I’ll always miss the gray cat I asked for who turned out to be orange and white, with green yellowish-brown spotted eyes, and the attitude of a king until the very end. You were born on March 20th, 2010, came into my life on June 28th of that same year, and left your physical body on January 17th, 2025. I’ll think of you and honor you most intensely on those dates but will miss you every other day, too.

The three of us here are heartbroken but endlessly grateful to have shared these years with you. I love you so much, baby. I hope you always knew that. When I write or think about you, I hope the love reaches you wherever you are.

Goodbye, my resilient baby, my king, my champion, my almost 15-year-old. I love you. Don’t ever forget it. 🤍",38,1737243377.0,seniorkitties,5,0.97,False

1i4kjaj,https://i.redd.it/9rpy2hnw7ude1.jpeg,Just wanted to say how grateful I am to Dutch for having a decent selection of sugar free options. ,"I’m newly on my sugar free game after being diagnosed with non alcoholic fatty liver. I got the diagnosis around 5 months ago. I’ve dropped 20 lbs since then. I absolutely would be lying if I said I have 0 sugar in my diet anymore because quitting something like sugar that you’ve had all your life is fucking hard… but I am trying and things like Dutch bros do make it a little easier. It’s like… should I go to Starbucks and get a drink with 50g sugar… or I can go to Dutch and get a drink that has maybe 2-3g when you account for milk and whatever else may have sugar. My point is I am grateful to have that option so while I’m trying to fight the sugar addiction I can still enjoy a sugar tasting coffee or rebel drink without the actual sugar. 

As of lately my favorite thing to order is a sugar free mocha with white coffee and oat milk and then whatever flavor combos I am feeling that day. Today I did strawberry and chocolate macadamia which is fantastic in my personal opinion. Sometimes I do chocolate macadamia and coconut tho. Or I’ll try other combos. 

Anyone that also does sugar free is more than welcome to share their drink recs in the comments. Specifically rebel ones because since switching to sugar free I haven’t had a rebel so I haven’t tried the sugar free rebels. Are they just as good? (I assume they are) 

Anyway, again, I appreciate Dutch not only catering to the sugar hungry crowd but also us folks trying really hard to cut out sugar as much as possible. 

Side note… if any broistas know what the proper order would be to giving out my drink order please let me know. I also feel bad ordering haha. ",46,1737243183.0,dutchbros,12,0.98,False

This is the nugget; I need to write something.  

Discovery for me arrived in my teens with *Blue Velvet*, recommended by a friend who worked in a video store rewinding tapes and watching *True Romance* on repeat all day. Up to that point I'd considered myself a serious student of cinema, worshiping alone, always alone, at the Church of Scorsese, jaw set like a young Keitel and with my eye on this new guy called Paul Thomas Anderson who was making a three-hour ~~porno~~  movie about porn. *Lost Highway* had just arrived in theaters but I wouldn't see that until a little later.  

Everything stopped dead for me when I reached the white picket fence across the front of *Blue Velvet*. Never before or since has an artist's work offered me this quality of urgency and immediacy. Though *Blue Velvet* felt like a dream, there seemed to be no sleep, no screen, no sense of safety between my wide eyes and Jeffrey Beaumont lifting a severed human ear out of the long grass in that vacant lot. I forgot about all my favorite directors, and going to the movies would never be the same. *Blue Velvet* wasn't a movie, it wasn't a film: it was something *other*. Suddenly I had a favorite *artist*.  

Though my first trip to *Twin Peaks* (like all of you, I've never left the place since, not for a moment) came at nineteen, my best friend in elementary school would scare me to death by playing his older brother's taped episodes that featured BOB. I loved horror movies, but this wasn't that. I would learn all about and become a literary practitioner of the uncanny later; all I knew then was that this wasn't fun-scary, it was scary-scary. Laura Palmer's smile and arched eyebrow were the medicine that cured my hammering heart. And, funny thing, my friend would actually scare himself in the process: one minute he'd be laughing at my clear fear of BOB, and the next we'd hear a random noise in his otherwise empty house (his parents seemed always to be out to dinner when we hung out) and he'd quickly grab his Nerf Turbo football and nervously say, ""Wanna go out and throw?""  

My early delight at Lynch's various hairstyles on display throughout *Pretty as a Picture*. Crying hard in my room every time Sandy told Jeffrey about her dream. Creating a makeshift painting room in the attic of my childhood home and spending hours up there with freezing fingers trying to make something like those wonderful works in my new hardcover copy of *Images*. Re-reading the *Lost Highway* screenplay and writing copycat short film scripts about characters who drink coffee and avoid dark corners of their own homes. Watching *Wild at Heart* for the first time with my finger on the remote STOP button for the duration, afraid my parents would hear the insanity coming from my room. Reading *Weirdsville, USA* on a family vacation with a huge smile on my face. Racing to McDonald's to have a filet-o-fish, fries, and a chocolate shake the moment I discovered the Easter egg on the new *Blue Velvet* DVD wherein David describes his favorite Mickey D's meal.  

Seeing *The Straight Story* alone in my favorite theater on opening day. I've still never seen a simpler, purer expression of sadness and hope on film. Richard Farnsworth's watery blue eyes looking at every passing bridge and blade of grass as though seeing everything for both the first and last time. Those bookends made of stars that still gently reach for me, accompanied by Angelo's gorgeous notes.  

And oh god, you guys, those wonderful days of *Inland Empire* and the coffee and the website, Lynch so exuberant over his discovery of digital video and that growing feeling that now we were going to experience a glut of Lynch masterpieces with all budgetary and creative constraints eliminated.  

In the summer of 2011, I had the chance to see in person, if not meet, David Lynch. He was to join Dr. Norman Rosenthal for a presentation of the latter's new book, *Transcendence: Healing and Transformation Through Transcendental Meditation*, at the Barnes & Noble bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles. I arrived hours early and asked a lady at the front desk where the presentation was to be held. And something extraordinary occurred then. My only guess is that she'd been badgered by one too many people with the exact question, because as soon as I mentioned it, she absolutely lost all control and began screaming at me: ""Don't you realize you are going to be required to purchase the book before you can attend the event? You think you can just walk in off the street and join in? The book is going to cost you $24.95 PLUS TAX, goddammit!"" It was like an absurd and potentially violent moment straight out of a Lynch film, and I, in my stupid broken hypersensitivity, was so upset that I left the bookstore with tears in my eyes, missing my chance to see the man who was the reason I'd moved to L.A. in the first place.  

I failed to forge a path to a successful screenwriting career. My dream from seventeen years old was dead. Two years ago (I'm now in my forties), again inspired by Lynch, I pulled myself up and moved to Los Angeles again. Post-Covid, it was, as our beloved hero has sometimes referred to Philadelphia, ""a hellhole."" I was attacked on the street no less than three times in my first weeks there. I found a crappy job and took the bus and feared for my life and wrote very little for the first year. My religious-nut roommate threatened to throw me out if she got the idea that I'd had a glass of wine at a restaurant or had the notion to read *Dracula*. Every day felt like spending Christmas all alone.  

But when I think back to that time, I remember turning north, always north, toward the Hollywood Hills, from whatever bus stop I was stranded at, my stupid joyful scribbles in my backpack. And I would do this every day, several times a day: I'd smile and look up into the hills and think, ""David Lynch is there - *right up there, right now* \- making things!"" I'd think about Lynch's words regarding the joy of doing, keeping your eye on the donut, not on the hole, and I'd tune into YouTube and watch his daily weather report the moment it was posted. I actually got to share those same blue skies and golden sunshines with my hero.  

Nothing matters right now but the fortuitous fact that I happened to share a planet with David Keith Lynch for 44 and a half years. My life was elevated by that *extra joy* I felt whenever I experienced his work, whether it was a feature-length film, an episode of *Rabbits*, the drawing of the daily number, a painting in *Someone Is in My House* that both scared the shit out of me and made me laugh my best, loudest laugh.  

Jesus, I feel like I want to walk halfway across a bridge and stop and turn to the sky like Esai Morales at the end of *La Bamba* and scream, ""DAAAAAAAAAAVIIIIIIIIIIIIIID!""  

I've been writing like a madman since the news broke, and I've promised myself never to stop until my body does. It's all about the joy of doing. God knows I actually truly love David Lynch, and my world today is dark without him.

1i4kdxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1i4kdxk/miele_cm6360_tips/,Miele CM6360 Tips,"I've just received the Miele CM6360, their countertop automatic coffee machine after decades with the built-in (and very basic) CVA6x series.

One of the most frustrating things about this purchase was the lack of online presence for the machine. Looking it's easy to find enormous online support groups that exist around the Jura brand but nothing around Miele. And, this is probably because of the enormous reach with all the options in the Jura line up while Miele does not have that reach or scope due to it's niche market segment. So, I had to watch and read everything I could to figure some things out and, I don't know Reddit much, but thought I could share it here in the superautomatic group in case it helps. I will add as I learn.

For starters, I really thought I was missing that milk jug! The milk hose is found in the water jug and it was a pretty slow day for me that day... I had to watch an unpacking video to see where the jug was (it didn't occur to me to turn the packaging around... slow day).

Setting up the machine was a breeze! After seeing how some folks got stymied getting stuck in the cycling modes, the first thing I learned was what that meant and what to do about it. So, if you get the cleaning or descaling mode messages the KEY thing is the amount of water used because this machine is that precise -- it notes the strength of the cleaning solution! If you think about it, this should be an 'of course it does' moment because the machine has to have safety measures in place for cleaning.  Without it, it would be grim in no time! So, it will keep running the cycle until the user gets the parameters right, and the directions are in the manual. It wants a very specific amount of water to make the solution it requires to achieve the goal of cleaning. So, slow down and do not panic if you get 'stuck' in a cleaning mode. You are not stuck, it's just waiting for you to get it right.

My kitchen has smart appliances which I found are more a PITA than anything. I like that my phone will give me some of the oven notifications but beyond that I am totally nonfussed about any quality of life gains this is supposed to represent. And, the entire concept of setting this up for morning brews before having to get out of bed makes no sense because the machine does a self rinse at warm up. Since you don't want a cup of THAT, you'll have to get up to put a cup in place for that nice brew when it happens. IMO, that app is a whole lot of fuss for nothing so I never bothered. Just want to add here in case I come across a ludite, my career was tech from the 90s, setting up and training and my whole home is automated -- I just can't be bothered with doing for the sake of doing when it is not smart. The app is not smart and would frustrate me to no end (see my first coffee of the day scenario.)

By keeping the setup as simple as possible to start I was able to get right in and start testing buttons. In anticipation for this present, we'd stocked up on some new cups which we would match to coffees. My husband decided that he's got a penchant for footed cups and likes their vibe so we found some insulated types and some without the added footing because I am always knocking things over and those around trouble around me. Anyway, we had no idea how much each button would hold so we just guessed our first go as we tested. The first brews were throw-aways to prime and clean out the machine from manufacturing residues. The initial results had wimpy foams and cremas.  But, these were just the cleaning testers so that outcome would improve with the machine primed. It really did improve too!

We can only drink so much coffee so will be learning as we go. It's going to be that every shortcoming will be likely just be something I need to learn, so I thought this could help others.

One thing that disappointed me was the layering of the fancy latter machiatto. It is such a pretty drink in all the marketing but mine was blah and messy, not at all distinctive layers enough to want to serve to a guest. Today we tried something and came across a solution incidentally. I like my coffee sweetened so we made a plain sugar syrup (50/50 white sugar to water) which I keep in a syrup dispenser in the fridge.  My husband was making cappuccinos and for the first one he did it up as usual, adding the sugar syrup at serving BUT the second one he added the sugar syrup before dispensing and it caused the milk to behave differently. My cappuccino came out like a perfect mini (strong) latte machiatto.

Once we got to enjoying the drinks I explored the settings a bit and turned down the, already gentle, sounds and lights to be as low-toned as possible. I'd read comments about the size and was happy and relieved to find it is such an elegant and compact unit, it fits my zero footprint kitchen no problem.

So, the process is students are hired after graduation at low wage, they need to pass a state test to become a Engineer in Training after 2 more years they become a PE with a stamp and such. The company increases wages significantly ($10.71 per hour) when the student passes the EIT exam and again after the PE exam.

So in Dec, the exam was held. ""M"" passed the exam as did several of her male counterparts.  I do the accounting and received the pay change forms. There was not one for ""M."" I thought it was overlooked, questioned it and was told she did not get one because finances were tight and her fiance could support her. I tried to state my opinion but was told I only think that because of some make believe ""girl pact."" I told them that was sexist 

So yesterday, we had a theme day....everyone wear their Lions gear, company provided lunch. The owner came up to me and asked when M and I were going to clean up the dishes and there had been some complaints because we had not been washing dishes the men put in the sink (ie coffee cups). I said I am not, we are all adults and can clean up after ourselves.

This started a ""war."" How do you politely expain sexism to people that do not get it?

During this time, we went completely no contact but I always had a feeling we might end up back together. After about 6 months, I went with my gut feeling and reached out asking to meet for a coffee and we started to talk again but she said she wanted to take things slow as she had believed things were fully over between us so felt a bit hesitant about another breakup I guess. 

After about 2 weeks of us talking again, she went out for lunch with a friend which I had a weird feeling about but she reassured me it was nothing. We end up back together officially soon after. Fast forward to a month ago and I'm still bothered by this lunch with a ""friend"" who she hasn't mentioned since. I ask her about it and she seemed weirded out that I brought it up but said it was a guy she had met through work during our break and they had gone on a few casual lunches. She had a feeling he liked her so she told him she was getting back with her ex during that last lunch and then stopped speaking to him - and she said this is why she didn't bring him up again to me because he stopped being a friend. 

Well when she told me this, I freaked out. Called her a liar, said she manipulated me, and said she had cheated on me and disrespected me (still kind of feel like this). She said we had only been speaking for a couple weeks and weren't back together yet so she didn't feel she ""owed"" me an explanation at the time and really saw him as a friend. I told her I never wanted to see her again and she tried to apologise etc but I just shut down and blocked her, and she didn't try reach out after that. 

I'm still not sure I 100% believe her but I have been feeling a lot of regret lately for being so angry at her  and accusing her of cheating because maybe it wasn't exactly that. On the other hand, if I wasn't right about her cheating then why didn't she try prove it? I feel like I need some closure. How can I reach out to her now after all that?

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

A few days ago, the police finally caught that dude, yes, the fake ""doctor"" who turns out to be Sofía’s half-brother.

Can you even imagine my face when I got called down to the station to “give my statement” right I dont even know if the cops screwed up or if I just got lucky, but there I was, sitting in the waiting room with some vending machine coffee that legit tasted like wet socks, low-key eavesdropping on his damn interrogation.. so there I was, pressed up against the wall.

Look I’m not a lawyer or anything, but c’mon, Clara’s my bestie. I HAD to know what this creep was gonna say about her baby.

Between muffled walkie-talkie noises and murmurs, I heard one of the officers kick things off:  
“Name?”  
And he’s all dry like, “Héctor Millán.”

But this dude wasn’t about to just spill his guts for free. Nah, he played hard to get until the cops hit him with a deal: “Give us enough to find the baby, and we’ll cut you some slack.” *Excuse me?* They’re out here bargaining with Satan while Clara’s life is in shambles.

But let me rewind a little because otherwise, this won’t make sense.

Turns out, Hector and Sofia met while bouncing from one orphanage to another. When he turned 18, he discovered some dusty files that revealed they shared the same mom. Creepy sibling bonding moment, I guess, because when I heard him say, *“We promised each other we’d never be victims again,”* I legit got chills. Like, imagine growing up with that mindset? The damage was already done at that point.

Hector managed to wiggle his way into some health tech program when he was 18, then used fake documents and experience from shady clinics to pass himself off as a fertility specialist. And when one of the cops asked, “Why fertility?” this psycho smirked and said, *“Because people pay fortunes to have kids.”*

Here’s where Clara comes into the picture. According to this dirtbag, Clara was the perfect target: loaded, vulnerable and desperate for a baby. Sofía? Oh,, she handpicked Clara for this con because they were already kinda close. Hector just saw dollar signs.

So Sofía slides in, plays the supportive BFF, listens to Clara vent about her struggles, and the moment Clara mentions fertility? BAM. “I know this amazing doctor” and “I’ll help you with everything” Clara bought it, of course, i mean, wouldn’t you trust your special friend? ?

But wait.. when one of the cops asked about how close Sofía and Clara were, and I SWEAR I almost dropped my gross coffee. Héctor, with this bitter laugh, said:  
  
Sofía fell in love with Clara, but that complicated things for me. I don’t know what was harder her feelings or what happened between us.

LIKE WHAT?!

And if you thought the egg donation thing was wild (you can see this whole drama in the others posts), Girl, it was all Héctor’s idea. He convinced Sofía it would ‘guarantee” she’d always have a connection to Clara and the baby. Emotional insurance, he called it. Who even THINKS like that???

 But the absolute worst part? Héctor admitted the plan was ALWAYS to sell the baby. he literally said: It was easier if Clara thought the baby had died.

when I tell you my blood ran cold… The level of evil here is Unreal*.* And don’t even get me started on how he bribed hospital staff, forged documents, and covered everything up like it was just another Tuesday.

Now, about Sofía… I have mixed feelings. On one hand, Hector confirmed she never wanted it to go this far. But on the other? She knew it was all a scam from the beginning. She just went along with it because she was obsessed with Clara. And honestly, at this point, I dont know if that’s love, delusion, or emotional damage manifesting in the worst way possible.

Ugh! and of course, Hector couldnt resist playing the victim card. He went on about how he was “just trying to survive” and how the system screwed him over. Girl, im like Boy shut up. and now he wants sympathy? Miss me with that nonsense.

Anywayyy after a while, the questions got all legal and technical, and before I could hear more, a cop noticed me lingering and kicked me out. I left with my brain spinning from the sheer amount of info I’d just absorbed.

Later, one of the detectives confirmed that Hector’s testimony was consistent, but there’s still a ton to verify. They need to track down the adoptive family, gather proof of the illegal adoption, and deal with the emotional wreckage left behind. Oh, and don’t even ask me about Javier(Clara's hubby)…his whereabouts are still a mystery.

1i4jxv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1i4jxv5/my_wife_got_baptized_today/,My wife got baptized today.,"I just wanted to give everyone an update on my situation.

A little over a month ago, I made a post about how my wife was exploring the Mormon Church. For a quick summary, I’m a 30 year old trans woman from a small Brigham Young pioneer town in New Mexico. I left the church at 16 struggling with gender dysphoria and lack of belief.

After leaving, I fell into alcoholism and heavy drug use for most of my college career. 

I was extremely angry at my wife for going to talk to my uncle, the town patriarch, about the church, her concerns with it, how it might impact me, but I believe in her religious freedom and I know she wasn’t earnestly wanting to get baptized to fall deep into the cult, but instead wanted to distance herself from her own extremely toxic and manipulative family church. 

So she got baptized today as a big ‘fuck you’ to her family. 

The usual things have happened to us while being “active”. I’m being pressured to detransition by the bishop because he just *knows* in his heart of hearts I’ll come around and see the value in my abandoned masculinity if I get sealed to my wife in the temple. Apparently, women are just special in the eyes of the church, and men need the power of the priesthood to stay holy because they just aren’t as dedicated, spiritual, or special as women are. 🙄

This framework completely erases my trans identity and paints us as a confused heterosexual couple. 

Don’t get me wrong okay? I love my family, despite some of them being extremely conservative oriented. My aunt knitted me a rainbow scarf for Christmas and encouraged me to wear it at church. 

During the ‘you’re just a confused man’ speech he gave me the other night, he also was quick to add that I’m not allowed to wear my scarf at church. Something something handbook, something something no showing affiliation with any groups or political organizations outside the church. 

After the baptism, my wife and I went down to the local lake and smoked a joint together. I asked her if she’s going to stop smoking, and she laughed, and told me ‘fuck no’. I asked her if she’s going to stop drinking coffee, and again, she laughed. ‘I do what I want.’ We went back home and watched some Moral Orel, which is a claymation Adult Swim show deconstructing the toxic parts of white Christianity. 

Now that this whole mess is over, she’s beginning to recognize being an active member means living one, two, or even three completely different lives. She also is very aware of the surface level acceptance of queer people, just as long as they’re ’trying to get better’. 

I actually found out through the grapevine that my old music teacher was ‘struggling with same sex attraction’ before I was born, but he ‘got right with God’, married a ‘good woman’, and his son ended up being my math teacher. 

‘You aren’t the only one in the Ramah Valley who struggles with queerness’, is what the bishop said. 

There are MAGA flags everywhere in this town. Less so after the election, but it was way worse before. In my backyard, there is a pride 🏳️‍🌈 flag hanging proudly on our fence. No one has fucked with it, no one treats us any differently since we hung it. 

As the only trans woman to ever live in the Ramah Valley *openly*, I just hope that my public daily queerness shifts the needle on acceptance here, however slightly it may be. 

‘Yeah, those two are a nice, cute couple. Shame about his condition though.’ 

When it comes to a church that lobbied fiercely against Prop 8 and marriage equality, I dunno. ‘Shame about his condition’ is probably the best I’m going to get. 

I’m just glad my marriage is strong enough to survive all this, and that my swearing, weed smoking, sex positive, coffee drinking wife didn’t let them make her doubt herself, even after getting dunked. 

She made a pair of missionaries happy, I dunno. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Maybe that makes me a narcissist. Who cares? I think if you’re into [this kind of hobby](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2mBb4gxJm0pVO6YIpacT1J?si=1vid1KxTTxW6MIi40pfkUg), you're probably a narcissist too. But whatever, we’re all selfish. That’s just the way it is.

So, I’m being normal. I mean, like, *really* normal. Not weird at all. Right? I’m thinking for myself. I’m not copying anyone. Just me, being me. And using others for my own gains, but that’s the most normal thing. I nailed it. I think I cracked the code to ""normal."" But, whatever. Forget I said that.

I think I’ve talked about this before. I wouldn’t mind having followers, an audience. Like, a little sense of authority, maybe. But then... *ugh*. You get the comments. The feedback. ""Do this."" ""Do that."" ""I hate you."" ""I love you."" It’s a circus, and I don’t want to be part of that. It’s *my* circus, not theirs. So, yeah, there’s that.

The whole digital landscape thing though, it’s a trap. You sacrifice yourself to the algorithm, to the ruthless social media world. It chews you up and spits you out, and I feel like I’m just tossing a piece of myself into the fire every time I post. But, I guess I want something to do. I need an outlet. Maybe it helps someone else who feels the same. I don’t know. Sacrifices, man. We make ‘em.

But *damn*, everything is a scam. You can’t trust anyone. Not even your mom. She lied to you about Santa, didn’t she? What makes you think she’s not taking money from your bank account? Whatever. I've learned to hide my stuff better now.

Anyway, I’m drinking... coffee. No fancy names for it. Not a macchiato or a frappuccino or whatever. Just coffee. I’m simple like that. Simple boy, simple world, just trying to survive this mess.

What’s with hot drinks though? They’re supposed to warm you up, but for me? Nah. It’s like, ""I was freezing, now I’m *on fire*."" Is that normal? I don’t know. Maybe I’m just too sensitive to temperature extremes.

AI girlfriend ads though? That’s some twisted shit. People getting attached to these robots, but the real evil is in the companies pushing this crap. They’re sucking up people’s loneliness and exploiting it. That’s disgusting. Marketing is just... sleazy. I tried messing with a business major once. Big red flag. Business feels dirty. Maybe it’s just me, though.

Speaking of dirty, when you get diagnosed with stuff, you just start seeing things (not ***those*** things). Like, you realize what your brain's doing, and it’s not always pretty. I don’t trust anything. Society’s evil. I know it sounds dramatic, but everything feels... wrong.

Sometimes I think, *What’s the point?* Like, will things ever get better? We’re all stuck in this endless loop of societal expectations, manipulation, and money... and it all just feels like a huge scam. But hey, I guess it’s just how life works. We live with it, even if we hate it.

But you know, we still crave connection. Even the introverts. We can say we’re done with people, but deep down, we want to be heard and want someone to care. And then there’s this whole parasocial thing, where influencers sell you this fake connection. It’s sickening, but people buy it. And the cycle continues. Everyone’s just out for profit.

The problem with fame is once you’re in it, you're *tainted.* That’s what scares me. Fame doesn’t seem fun when it’s tied to money and power. Once you’re there, you’re just part of the system. And, honestly, I’m not sure I wanna be part of that.

And then there’s money. Ugh, money. It’s everywhere. You can’t escape it. You need it, you use it, but it poisons everything. We all live for it, but it doesn’t *feed* the soul. It just feeds... everything else.

Also, school’s a joke. It’s all about money. It’s not about knowledge. Teachers get paid, the principal gets paid, the system survives on cash, and you’re left with nothing but debt. The whole thing’s a scam. A corrupt system, trying to teach you how to work in a broken world.

I just... sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to live without all this. To just escape, go live in the woods, and be free. But, deep down, I know that’ll never happen. We can’t escape the system. We can’t change society overnight, and the longer you live, the more you realize it’s just the way things are.

But still, I keep thinking about it, about how it could be different. It won’t, though. That’s the sad reality. We live in this *void,* and we’re stuck here.

And yeah, depression’s a bitch. The hallucinations, the overwhelming emotions—it takes over sometimes. Feels like my soul’s trying to escape, but it’s stuck in this body. But hey, maybe it’s all part of it, right? The chaos. The dark stuff that keeps me going... somehow.

Anyway, I don’t know. I don’t really have a conclusion here. Maybe this journal entry doesn’t have a point, but it’s what’s on my mind. If you're out there, [listening to this](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2mBb4gxJm0pVO6YIpacT1J?si=1vid1KxTTxW6MIi40pfkUg), just... think about it.",1,1737241419.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,0.99,False

Me 31F and my best friend 30F we will call her Tilly have been friends for over 13yrs. We went to high school together she was a grade below me however we had an elective class together. Right off the bat she accepted me. I moved to  her school my junior year. Being a New girl in school with not knowing anyone can be tough. She easily invited me in her friend group. Now ive had traumatic experiences with friend groups. Its hard for me to  open up to most people. It was easy with her. She is the only friend i stayed in contact with from high school over the years. Even when i lived hours away. She has been through every major milestone from my children being born, their birthdays ect. My kids even call her Aunt Tilly. Fast forward to the last two years. I ended up leaving an very emotionally abusive relationship and moved from hours away back to my home town. Around 7 to 8 months later i attempted to date. It was not the best experience and honestly i may have told her way too many details regarding these encounters. One particular was quite traumatic. In the event of meeting this man i put myself in danger. When told about this incident, this was the most angry i have ever seen her. She's usually sweet and calm(the mom friend). I straighted myself up from there and tried my best to make good decisions.  In this moment i knew she was in the right for watching me be impulsive.  I cannot argue that. When i decided to date again i got on the dating apps again. For the record i really wasnt sure i really even wanted to date and i felt defeated from all of the conversations that wouldnt go anywhere but ""hey how are you"" same conversations every day nothing truly getting to know eachother. The people i talked to were the complete oppsite of what i was looking for. The day i decided to delete the app i went on bumble one last time to see that one of the guys had replied to me. So i decided to message back. This man 34M (we will call him Paul) talked to me for hours on the phone about everything you could think of. We bonded over our love for space and stargazing. Our houmors matched so perfectly. Im blunt... i have ADHD and  im Autistic so its so easy for me not to fit in well especially with any type of social cues. My humor is quite dark i blame the trauma. But hey if you can laugh at it now it makes you not want to sulk about it. Paul's energy matched mine perfectly. We set up to meet at this cute coffee shop downtown. I was so nervous becase im Awkward as it gets. The date goes wonderfully 💕  so much so that im quite literally like so comfortable already with this guy it feels natural. Like im not pushing myself to be someone else for a guy. When i get home i text Tilly and tell her how it went. She says shes happy for me but to be careful. I tell her i will. Over the next few months, Paul and i continue to talk and officially start dating. Keep in account, this is on my own time when im able to see him. Im particularly picky around bring men around my kids. I do admit i didnt talk to my friend all day everyday like i did previously while being single. I never stopped talking to her all together finally it comes time for Tilly to meet him and we meet up. I feel like everything goes well. Tilly is skeptical. Tillys Boyfriend Thomas genuinely likes him. However Tilly said that she just needs to get to know him. Im hopeful at this moment. It honestly meant alot that she was open to trying. However something snapped in tilly all of the sudden she became hostile. Every time i would mention paul or bring up him meeting the kids she would lose it. We are like 4 months into this relationship. Im comfortable allowing him to meet my kids so we set it up. Things went great however this was during an event i had planned/hosted that Tilly and thomas were both attending. The entire time Tilly was giving him dirty looks. Standing in the corner sulking. Everytime paul tried to interact with my kids it made her more angry. (as small as making a plate for my kid) from this point on things went so badly. She told me she doesnt like him. Out of the multiple times meeting him. Her reasonings were he seems too comfortable... somethings off. I tried to get them to interact so she could get to know him instead of just being judgy all the time. Like i knew him. She wouldn't even try. I could not talk about him to her without her acting some way. Finally i kinda got tired of the way she was acting. So i stopped trying to have them around each other. However i was torn because thats my best friend... how could she not try to get to know him and how could she not accept that i was happy. I let stuff get to my head and had a BPD meltdown causing all kinds of problems. Including paul going into psychosis(he struggles with metal illness as well) he did some crazy stalking stuff and had to go to the ER. Im aware how it sounds. Im very aware of my actions and how vauge it sounds. However it was an instant I Told you so from Tilly. She never once took into accountability how i was just as at fault. If you're aware of BPD. you know how it goes. After things died down after the incident spanning over a month i decided to try and talk things out with Paul. Where we went wrong with our actions and so forth... i still have very strong feelings for this man and i was unfortunately between medications when the incident happened. When i tell you i went crazy it was bad.(nothing physical) he honestly had the worst of it.  Him and i start talking again and he helps me move and clean helping me when no one else would. Slowly more things come to light and we work through our issues. We decided that we are in the right mind to try and make things right. However my family and Tilly lost it. Tried to have me sent to an impatient facility because they thought it was a psychotic break of some sort. When the truth came to light with my family and my part of this situation my family is somewhat coming around however Tilly isnt. She's convinced that im messing things up. She has text me once in the past months just to exchange our stuff never to get my side of things or even let me explain things to her. She just doesnt want to hear it because from the moment she met him she cant stand him. (Shes been the same way about every man i have dated since high school) So my question... AITAH for continuing to date him even though she doesnt like him? Am i ending a friendship over a guy? Ive been nothing but supportive for everything going on in her life. Why has she not been supportive of this relationship since the very beginning? Any input i would appreciate. Im just at a loss right now. I dont want to give up my friend.

1i4jx2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i4jx2m/is_someone_getting_scammed/,Is someone getting scammed?,"I'll keep the overview brief and add more detail further along.

For about 4 weeks, my house has been getting deliveries addressed to a person I don't know. They are mostly from Walmart and they arrive from USPS, Fedex, but most commonly as a local delivery (Walmart is about 17 minutes away). They are usually simple household goods.

Can this be a scam? If the person ordering this complains that they never receive the items, the best they get is a refund, right? No way they are charging me for it.

It started before Christmas. I called when the package was delivered as I was afraid that someone wasn't going to get their Christmas gift. Walmart said to keep it and they'd deal with it. The packages and deliveries keep coming. I have returned two of them to the local Walmart at the customer service desk, but I'm just keeping everything from here forward. I have received Q-tip (that's a favorite, at least 3 of these), mugs, a tumbler, a bowl, 5-pack of mac and cheese, cord dogs, cat and dog bowls and toys, a spiral notebook, Solo and coffee cups, and cleaning supplies. Nothing expensive or interesting.

My address is pretty unusual. It is (censored) Highway, but it's just a country back road. I can't find road name elsewhere in the US, but it's an actual highway so there are no buildings on it, so I'm thinking my street address is unique. 

If a person was legitimately not getting this many items in a row (I believe I am up to 10), someone would fix the address and this would stop, but it hasn't. Ideas?",3,1737241372.0,Scams,6,0.72,False

While Jenny and Anna accused each other of pushing the planchette around the board, Michelle sat back and said, “I don’t think we should be doing this.”

“I agree,” Tina fixed her eyes on mine, “It’s dumb. I think we should go,” she hooked her thumb over her shoulder.

“I think we should stay,” I replied, “It’s not like we have anything better to do.”

“You can leave if you want,” Hailey said to Michelle, “It’s okay if you're too scared to continue.”

“I’m not scared,” Michelle insisted, but we could tell from the tremble in her voice that she was.

“Let’s try it again,” Jenny said, “And this time nobody better push it,” she eyed Anna when she spoke.

“I didn’t push it,” Anna snapped, “You did.”

“Will you two just stop,” Hailey interrupted before they could start their argument again.

Tina looked over at me and rolled her eyes, making me regret that I had invited her.

“Everyone put your fingers back on the planchette,” Hailey instructed.

Michelle was the last one to obey.

“What should we ask the spirit?” Hailey was addressing the group.

“We should probably ask if it’s still here,” Anna said, “It might’ve left after having to listen to Jenny whine about me pushing the planchette.”

“That would’ve been the smart thing for the spirit to do,” Tina quipped.

“Will you stop,” I said to her, “You don’t have to stay.”

While I addressed Tina, Jenny made a face at Anna but thankfully didn’t say anything back.

“Everyone shut up,” Hailey said. Once she was certain nobody else was going to say anything, she said, “Spirit, are you still with us?”

I reached out and pushed the planchette over to the word YES.

As soon as I stopped pushing it, Anna and Jenny started bickering about who they thought pushed the planchette again.

“This is such a waste of time,” Tina got to her feet, “They are never going to believe we are the ones pushing it.” She walked off, disappearing through a nearby wall.

She was right, but I didn’t want the night to be a total waste so I used the last of my energy to fling the Ouija Board off the table before I left.",39,1737241276.0,shortscarystories,7,1.0,False

I'm starting a bakery from my home within the next 2-3 months (I still have some planning to do) and I have been so stuck on trying to figure out a name. I am okay with ""Vegan"" being in the name, but it doesn't have to. 

My plan is to start this bakery from home, hopefully gain a following and eventually open a storefront where I can also grow and sell houseplants (that's the dream anyway!). So I'd really like a name that could work now, but also grow with me. 

I really want to convey a homey feel with the name. I love making baked goods that people cannot tell they're vegan. It's my biggest goal when baking anything. I don't know if that is helpful in coming up with a name at all!

Some items I plan to start with are Chocolate Chip Cookies with flaky sea salt, Sourdough Cinnamon Buns, Brownies, Salted Rosemary Focaccia, Savory Scones and Chocolate Cupcakes with Vanilla Frosting. 

I'm planning to wholesale at a local grocery store and possibly a coffee shop that has four locations (they only have drinks right now and no food and I know the owner pretty well so I'm hoping she will want to work with me after trying my desserts!)

Been separated now for 6 months. Married 13 years, together 26 years One 11 year old daughter. Wife initiated separation. I was devastated and still am. She moved out with the child, first to her mums and then into a flat her mother owns. Im in the family home which will be sold in April, or May (the loneliness here is awful, and soul destroying but thats a whole other story) The way she left it was clear that the door was never fully shut. There's a chance, more equal relationship, need time to get better,that kind of stuff..

Anyways about a month in she starts wanted to meet, hang out,, food coffee etc.. This progresses to coming to hers for lunch, dinner etc and sleeping together. .This was while she was still at her mums, so all in theory until she moves in to the flat in November.

Alll through this we are in constant communication on whatsapp, communicating better than we have in years. really felt promising. Anyway we have meetings, some good, some bad overall progress though I'd say. Spent Xmas together which didnt go so well, wth MiL there. Felt deeply uncomfortable

Fast forward to now and wife is in her new flat and she seems to have cooled slightly on sleeping together etc. Saying that 'we are not quite there yet' We are still meeting and messaging regularly. No invites to dinner, movies though.

So really, I'm a bit tired of this limbo after six months. I desperately want back with her and she know this, but I think she is content with keeping me hanging. I am not, its affecting my mental health and sleep pretty severely. If I mention fixing the marriage, she doesn't like this, and says its all about 'rebuilding a friendship, and not ruling anything out in future' She refuses to commit.
