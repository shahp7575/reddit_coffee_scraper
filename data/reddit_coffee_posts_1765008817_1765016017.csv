I'll try to keep this short!

so I (23F) recently posted a short video for me and my gfs (24F) 8 year anniversary. It's part of a little tradition we have together, we both draw each other something and post it to a song that reminds us of each other since it was what started our relationship in the first place! This little tradition holds a lot of sentiment and I really love my gf!

so here's the issue: my friend (23F) had just gone through a breakup. She dated this guy online for less than two months, and the whole relationship was over Discord. She told me they ended things because of her mental health issues (she believes she has BPD but has not been formally diagnosed by a doctor).

when it happened, I did everything I could to support her. I listened, comforted her, reassured her that her life isn't over and that it was actually just starting for her, and even took her out for coffee to get her mind off things. and I just really tried to cheer her up.

after I posted the anniversary video, she DM'd me saying I was ""inconsiderate"" and that she didn't know I was ""that type of person."" She then accused me of always trying to outshine her and acting like I ""have it all,"" which honestly took me by surprise. i didn't post to ""show off"" or rub it in her face, it's just been something I've been doing for years..

I told her I didn't mean anything malicious by it, but she doubled down and made me feel guilty for posting the video at a ""sensitive time""

I genuinely care about her, and I understand breakups hurt, but I don't think what I did was a crime..? I've always been a private person and felt shy of posting about my relationship anyways so her doing this just sorta confirmed my anxieties over posting and stuff so I'm just real confused rn

So... yall AITAH?

1pfluxo,https://youtu.be/i32dKrBsABI,3 Very Scary TRUE Highway Horror Stories,"# ""One Ride, One Chance"":

I was just fifteen, running away from home after my parents split up. I wanted to get to my grandfather's place in Los Angeles, so I stuck out my thumb on the side of Interstate 5, hoping for a ride south. Two guys were already there hitchhiking too, and we chatted a bit while waiting. One of them said, ""Be careful who you get in with. Some drivers are weird."" I nodded, but I felt tough enough to handle myself.

A blue van pulled up after a while. The driver, an older man with gray hair and a rough face, leaned out the window. ""Where you headed?"" he asked.

""Los Angeles,"" I said.

He looked at the two guys, then at me. ""I can only take one. The girl's small, she'll fit."" The van looked empty in the back, plenty of space, but he shook his head at the guys. ""No room for all of you.""

The guys frowned. One whispered to me, ""Don't go alone with him. Something feels off."" But I thought, what could go wrong? It was daytime, and he seemed like a regular person. I climbed into the passenger seat, waving bye to the guys. The door shut with a click, and we drove off.

At first, everything was fine. He asked about my family, why I was traveling. ""Parents fighting?"" he said. I shrugged and said yes. He nodded, like he understood. ""Life's hard sometimes."" We passed trucks and cars, the road stretching out flat. But then he missed the turn for the main highway south. ""Hey, that's the way to L.A.,"" I pointed out.

He smiled strangely. ""Shortcut. Faster this way."" But we were heading east now, toward empty desert land. No buildings, just dry dirt and rocks. ""Turn around,"" I said, my voice getting louder. ""This isn't right.""

He kept driving, ignoring me. I grabbed the door handle, ready to jump out at the next stop. He pulled over suddenly, by some bushes. ""Need to stretch,"" he muttered, getting out. I stayed in the seat, watching him walk around. My mind raced—what if I run now? But the area was so open, nowhere to hide.

He came back fast, too fast. Before I could move, he hit me hard on the head from behind. Everything went blurry. I fell against the door, pain exploding in my skull. ""What are you doing?"" I gasped.

""Quiet,"" he growled, pulling me into the back of the van. He tied my hands with rope from under the seat. I kicked and twisted, but he was strong. ""Stop fighting,"" he said. ""It'll be worse if you don't."" The van doors were shut, no one could see. He drove off the road, deeper into the desert. Hours passed like that, me scared in the back, him silent up front.

When it got dark, he stopped again. He came back, his face close to mine. ""You shouldn't have gotten in,"" he whispered. Then he hurt me in ways I didn't know a person could. I cried out, begging him to stop. ""Please, let me go. I won't tell anyone."" He just laughed low. ""No one's coming for you."" The pain went on and on, my body aching, mind numb. I faded in and out, wishing it would end.

By morning, he dragged me out. The ground was rough under my feet. He had a tool in his hand, sharp and heavy. ""This is it,"" he said, raising it. I screamed as he swung down, cutting deep into my arms. Blood everywhere, hot and sticky. One arm, then the other. I fell, the world spinning. He thought I was gone, pushed me over the edge of a steep drop, into a ditch below the highway.

But I wasn't dead. Pain burned through me, but I forced my eyes open. The stumps where my arms used to be bled bad. I dipped them in mud from the ground, packing it tight to slow the flow. ""Keep going,"" I told myself. ""Don't stop."" The cliff was high, maybe thirty feet, rocks sharp. I climbed slow, using my elbows and knees, slipping on loose dirt. Every inch hurt like fire.

At the top, I walked along the empty road, holding my arms up so the blood wouldn't pour out. Cars were far off, but one came close. Two men inside stared, then drove away fast. ""Help,"" I whispered, but they were gone. I kept walking, dizzy, legs weak. Another car approached—a couple this time. The woman gasped when she saw me. ""Oh no, what happened?"" she said.

""Man attacked me,"" I managed. ""Hospital, please.""

They wrapped me in a blanket, drove quick. At the hospital, doctors rushed in. I told the police everything—the van, his face, what he said. ""Gray hair, about fifty, blue van,"" I described. They drew a picture from my words.

Weeks later, they caught him. In court, I faced him again, my new fake arms stiff. He whispered as he passed, ""I'll finish it one day."" But I stood tall, told the judge everything. He went to prison, but not long enough.

Years passed, he got out, hurt someone else. I testified again, made sure he stayed locked up forever. Now I live quiet, make art with my tools, have a family. But that ride changed everything. Always be careful on the road.





# ""The Shortcut"":

I had just finished visiting my aunt in a small town up north, and my bus ticket fell through because of some mix-up at the station. It was getting late, but I figured I could thumb a ride along the main road. That's how people get around in these parts sometimes, especially when money is tight. The highway stretched out like a long ribbon through the trees, with cars zooming by every now and then. I stuck out my hand and waited.

After a bit, a big truck slowed down and pulled over. The driver was a man with a scruffy beard and eyes that looked too tired. He leaned over and opened the passenger door. ""Need a lift?"" he asked, his voice rough but not mean.

""Yes, please,"" I said, climbing in. ""I'm heading toward the next town, about thirty miles east.""

He nodded and started driving. His name was Tom, he told me. He drove trucks for a living, hauling logs or something. The cab smelled like old coffee and cigarettes. We chatted a little at first. He asked about my family, and I told him about my aunt and how she made the best pies. He laughed, but it sounded forced.

As the miles went by, things got quiet. The trees closed in on both sides of the road, making everything feel closed off. I noticed he kept glancing at me, not in a friendly way, but like he was studying something. ""You hitchhike a lot?"" he finally asked.

""Not really,"" I replied. ""Just when I have to. It's usually safe around here.""

He smirked. ""Safe? You hear about those girls who go missing on this stretch? They say it's the road that takes them.""

My skin prickled. I had heard stories, whispers from friends about women vanishing while trying to get home. But I pushed it away. ""That's just talk,"" I said, trying to sound brave.

""Maybe,"" he muttered. ""But I've seen things. Empty cars by the side, no one around. Once, I picked up a girl like you. She was chatty at first, then she got quiet. Never saw her again after I dropped her off.""

I shifted in my seat, watching the dashboard lights flicker. ""Why are you telling me this?""

""Just making conversation,"" he said, but his hands tightened on the wheel. We passed a sign for a rest stop, but he didn't slow down. ""You thirsty? I got some water in the back.""

""No, thanks,"" I said quickly. Something felt off. His eyes kept darting to the rearview mirror, like he was checking for something behind us.

A few minutes later, he turned off the main highway onto a smaller road. ""Shortcut,"" he explained. ""Saves time.""

The path got bumpy, with branches scraping the sides of the truck. No other cars around. My phone had no signal—I checked it twice. ""This doesn't look right,"" I said, my voice shaking a little. ""Can we go back to the highway?""

He didn't answer right away. Instead, he slowed the truck and looked at me. ""You know, you're pretty. Remind me of someone I knew.""

""Please, turn around,"" I insisted, gripping the door handle.

He stopped the truck suddenly, in the middle of nowhere. The engine hummed, but everything else was still. ""Get out,"" he said flatly.

""What?"" I stared at him.

""Get out and walk if you don't like it."" But his hand moved to his pocket, and I saw the outline of something sharp.

My mind raced. I remembered the stories—girls picked up, never seen again. Bodies found later in the woods. I couldn't let that happen. ""Okay,"" I said, pretending to be calm. I opened the door slowly and stepped out. The ground was soft under my feet.

He watched me, not moving. Then he smiled, a creepy smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Run along now.""

I started walking back toward the highway, but I heard the truck door open behind me. Footsteps. He was following. My heart pounded so hard I could hear it in my ears. I walked faster, then broke into a run. The trees blurred as I dashed through them, branches whipping my face.

""Hey!"" he called. ""Come back! I was just joking!""

But I knew he wasn't. I kept running, zigzagging to lose him. I heard him crashing through the brush, getting closer. ""You can't get away!"" he shouted.

I tripped over a root and fell, scraping my knees. Pain shot through me, but I got up. In the distance, I saw lights—maybe the highway. I pushed harder, lungs burning.

His voice echoed again, nearer. ""I see you!""

Panic flooded me. I hid behind a thick tree, holding my breath. His footsteps stopped. Silence, except for my ragged breathing. Then, a snap of a twig. He was close.

I peeked out. He was scanning the dark, a knife in his hand now, glinting under the moon. Oh no. I had to move.

I bolted toward the lights. He heard and chased. ""Stop!""

The highway appeared ahead. A car whizzed by. I waved my arms wildly. ""Help!""

The car slowed. An older couple inside. The woman rolled down the window. ""What's wrong?""

""He's after me!"" I gasped, pointing back.

The man got out, phone in hand. ""Get in!""

I jumped in the back seat. They locked the doors just as Tom emerged from the trees. He saw us and froze, then turned and ran back to his truck.

The couple drove me to the police station. I told the officers everything—his truck, his words, the knife. They nodded gravely. ""We've had reports like this,"" one said. ""Girls going missing on that road. You're lucky.""

They searched for him, but he was gone. Later, I learned he matched descriptions from other cases. Women abducted while hitchhiking, some never found. One survivor had said a man in a truck tried to grab her, but she fought back.

I still think about that night. The way his eyes changed, the isolation of that highway. It could have been me in those woods forever. Now, I warn everyone: don't hitchhike alone. The road has secrets, and some people on it are monsters.





# ""The Fremantle"":

I had just turned seventeen and was out with friends at a party in Fremantle. It was a fun night, laughing and dancing, but I drank a bit too much beer and missed my ride home. My house was in a suburb called Palmyra, not too far, but walking alone late at night didn't feel smart. Still, I started down the quiet street, hoping to thumb a lift from someone nice.

A white car pulled up beside me. Inside was a man and a woman, both looking ordinary, like any couple. The woman leaned over and smiled. ""Need a ride?"" she asked. ""It's late. Where are you headed?""

""Palmyra,"" I said, relieved. ""Just up the road. Thanks.""

The man nodded. ""Hop in the back. We're going that way.""

I got in, and we drove off. They introduced themselves as David and Catherine. ""Had a good night?"" Catherine asked, turning to look at me.

""Yeah, party with friends,"" I replied. ""You guys out late too?""

David chuckled. ""Just driving around. Nice to help out.""

The car smelled like cigarettes and something sweet, maybe air freshener. We chatted about nothing much—music on the radio, the cool air. But then David turned down a side street I didn't know. ""Shortcut,"" he said when I asked.

My heart started beating faster. The houses looked different. ""This isn't the way to Palmyra,"" I said, sitting up.

Catherine turned, her smile gone. ""Relax. We're taking a quick stop.""

David stopped the car in front of a plain house on Moorhouse Street. ""Come inside for a minute,"" he said, his voice harder now.

I shook my head. ""No, I want to go home. Let me out.""

Before I could move, David grabbed my arm and pulled a knife from his pocket. The blade flashed under the streetlight. ""Get inside, or I'll use this,"" he growled.

Fear hit me like a wave. Catherine opened the door and helped push me toward the house. ""Don't make noise,"" she whispered. ""It'll be worse if you do.""

Inside, the place was dim, with old furniture and a musty smell. They led me to a bedroom and made me sit on the bed. David chained my ankle to the bedpost, the metal cold and tight. ""What are you doing?"" I cried. ""Please, let me go. My parents will look for me.""

Catherine laughed softly. ""No one knows you're here. Be good, and it might not hurt too much.""

David left the room, and Catherine stayed, watching me. She smoked a cigarette, blowing smoke in my face. ""We've done this before,"" she said. ""Girls like you. Just do what he wants.""

I begged her. ""Why me? I didn't do anything. Please help me.""

She shook her head. ""I can't. He's my husband. We do this together.""

David came back with a drink. ""Here, swallow these pills,"" he ordered. ""It'll make you calm.""

I refused, but he forced my mouth open and pushed them in, holding my nose until I swallowed. They were sleeping pills, making me drowsy fast. The room spun. Then he started touching me, taking off my clothes. I fought, but the chains held me, and he was strong. He hurt me bad, over and over. Catherine watched the whole time, sometimes joining in. ""Good girl,"" she murmured. ""See? It's easier if you don't fight.""

The pain was awful, like fire inside. I cried quietly, thinking of my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. Hours passed in that nightmare. When he finished, they left me chained there, naked and sore, in the dark room.

Morning came slow. David unchained me and gave me clothes to wear—their clothes, baggy and strange. ""You're coming with me to work,"" he said. ""Act normal, or I'll kill you right there.""

Catherine nodded. ""And we'll find your family too. Hurt them worse.""

They drove me to a phone company where David worked. He made me walk around the parking lot, collecting car license numbers on a paper. ""Write them down,"" he snapped. ""Don't talk to anyone.""

People were around—workers, cars coming and going—but David watched me close. I thought about running, screaming for help, but the knife was in his pocket, and his eyes promised death. My hands shook as I wrote the numbers. One man smiled at me as he passed. ""Hi there,"" he said.

""Hi,"" I mumbled, heart pounding. But David was too near. I couldn't risk it.

Back at the house that afternoon, they chained me again. David went out, and Catherine sat with me. ""You did okay,"" she said. ""Maybe we'll keep you longer.""

""Please,"" I whispered. ""Let me go. I won't tell.""

She just smiled. ""David decides.""

When he returned, they made me dance for him, no clothes on. The music played low, some old song. ""Move,"" he commanded. I did, tears running down my face, feeling so small and broken. Then he pulled me to the bed again, chaining me beside him. Catherine slept in another room. He hurt me more that night, his breath hot and sour. ""You're mine now,"" he whispered.

I lay awake after, staring at the ceiling, the chain biting my skin. I had to escape. Tomorrow, somehow.

Next morning, David got up early for work. He unchained me to use the bathroom, then chained me back to the bed. Catherine checked on me. ""Stay quiet,"" she said, locking the bedroom door before leaving to drop him off.

The house went silent. I tugged at the chain—solid, locked to the bed. But the window was there, closed but not locked. It was small, high up, with a screen. I stood on the bed, heart racing. Could I fit?

I pushed the window open slow, no noise. The screen popped out easy. Outside was a backyard, fence, then street. Freedom.

But the chain held me back. It was long enough to reach the window, but not out. I wrapped it around my hand, pulled hard. The bed moved a little— it wasn't bolted down. Hope surged. I yanked again and again, dragging the heavy bed toward the window inch by inch. Sweat dripped down my back. The frame scraped the floor, loud in the quiet.

Finally, the bed was close enough. I climbed up, squeezed my head through the window, then shoulders. The chain pulled tight on my ankle. I twisted, pushed, ignoring the scrapes on my skin. My body slid out, falling to the grass below with a thud. The chain caught, but I was free—except for the metal still on my leg.

No time to worry. I ran, barefoot, down the street. Houses blurred by. I knocked on the first door—no answer. Second—nothing. Third, a woman opened, eyes wide at me, dirty and wild.

""Help,"" I gasped. ""I've been kidnapped. Call the police.""

She let me in, gave me water. ""What happened?"" she asked, dialing the number.

""A couple took me. Hurt me. Please hurry.""

Police came quick. Two officers, a man and a woman. I told them everything—the car, the house, the chains, the pain. ""Their names are David and Catherine,"" I said. ""On Moorhouse Street.""

The woman officer looked doubtful. ""You sure? You look okay. Maybe you ran away from home?""

""No!"" I shouted. ""It's true. Take me there. I'll show you.""

They drove me to the station first, asked more questions. I repeated it all, crying now. ""Believe me. They're killers. I saw things in the house—videos, weird stuff.""

Finally, the woman officer, named Laura, said, ""Okay. Let's check the address.""

We drove to Moorhouse Street. I pointed out the house. ""That's it.""

They knocked. Catherine answered, calm as anything. ""Can I help you?""

The officers went in with me. I showed them the bedroom—the chain still there, bed pulled to the window. David wasn't home yet, but Catherine's face went pale.

They arrested her. Later, when David got home, police grabbed him too. In the house, they found evidence—videos of other girls, graves in the backyard. Four girls before me, all killed after being hurt like that.

The trial was long. I had to stand in court, face them again. ""That's the man who chained me,"" I said, pointing at David. ""He hurt me bad."" Catherine stared at me, no emotion.

The judge gave them life in prison. David died there later, but Catherine's still locked up.

I got help after—talked to doctors about the fear that stayed with me. Now I live normal, but I warn others: never take rides from strangers. That night on the road could have ended me, but I fought back. I escaped.",1,1765015665.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1pfluhz,https://i.redd.it/gy6ks5tl5k5g1.jpeg,Curious Life Café: good coffee abut surprising deal breakers,"I've visited Curious Life twice now - once at the Blue outlet and once at the Red outlet. The coffee is genuinely good, and the food is solid too, but there are a couple of really basic issues that will probably keep me from going back.

1. No V60 option

They only brew using Aeropress. Nothing wrong with Aeropress, but I personally find their brews a bit too strong, and it's surprising that a specialty café doesn't offer a simple V60 pour-over, as i feel in a cafe if the v60 recipe is followed it results in a better brew. 

2. No Wi-Fi

For a café this popular, it feels odd that they don't offer Wi-Fi. The mobile network inside is also pretty weak, so getting any work done is almost impossible.

Great coffee, but missing somethings that make it a deal breaker.

I do freelance work and study at home and I can’t seem to manage to sit and work. It’s like I get claustrophobic and start searching for some excuse to go outdoors. I luckily have some flexibility to work anywhere (I have an ipad, although my desk computer would be better to do the actual job), but I can’t afford working at a coffee house often and neither can stay all day at the library. I will usually get obsessed with ergonomics everytime I sit and convinced myself I just have to build the proper space, which becomes a great way to procrastinate.

I’ve realized I only seem to be able to work when I trick my brain into thinking I’m actually doing something else (for example, starting working during a game’s loading screen), I’m on the move (public transport) or I’m sure it’ll be a very short period of focused work (waiting for an appointment, for water boiling at the kitchen…).

First post here, I recently bought a very basic Delonghi Espresso machine. I'm having a whale of a time with it and am using it every day but I'm not convinced the shots I'm getting are pulling correctly. I am using pre ground espresso at the moment (although I have bought beans and a grinder)... I use the basic scoop that came with the machine but don't have a dosing ring, so when I put two scoops into the filter it spills out and I end up dosing less. This then throws off the measure of course so that I'm not sure I'm filling the basket evenly. Does anyone have any tips? Am I better off using freshly ground beans? Do I need a better tamper? Like I say the coffee tastes nice enough to me but I do wonder if it could be better. I also weighed the most recent pull I got out of it and when it got to 36g it looked like there was hardly any coffee in it so I pushed it to 75!!

For context, he was physically abusive to my mum in 2020, which caused me to realise hes a narc and not the amazing man I thought he was and I've been through several years of therapy. 

I live 2 hours drive from my parents house. 

I told him my friends here, and he asked to meet up tomorrow. I'm meeting him in 2 hours at a cafe, and bringing a friend along to listen in. 

He makes me feel ""icky"" and disgusting about myself, as he always treated me as the golden child who was ""better than my mum"". I'm planning to grey rock/yellow rock him.

Any tips?? I'm hoping thisll be a chance to resolve thoughts in my head about him, and to confirm to him I no longer want a relationship with him. ",4,1765015350.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

Because of that, I went for a full body check-up. The results showed:

Vitamin D deficiency

Slightly high cholesterol

High lymphocyte count

TSH level of 9.54 (reference range 0.51–6.44), while T3 and T4 were normal


Before this, I had already been dealing with stomach issues. Our drinking water got contaminated with sewage, which caused a severe gut infection and diarrhea. I took Ofloxacin and Ornidazole many times, but inconsistently. After recovering, I still had mild stomach pain and discomfort, so my parents took me to our family doctor.

My parents also told the doctor that I had been under stress because I failed a class and couldn’t get into a university despite trying hard. The doctor diagnosed me with IBS and prescribed enzymes, escitalopram, levosulpiride, and rabeprazole. I didn’t take the escitalopram regularly because I didn’t want antidepressants.

After the hair loss started and the thyroid reports came, we consulted an endocrinologist. He immediately prescribed Levothyroxine, but we were not fully convinced because we wanted further testing. So we repeated the tests with TSH and TPO antibodies. The new results showed:

TSH: 6.54 (reference range 0.49–4.22)

TPO antibodies: 384 (reference range up to 36)


The endocrinologist again prescribed the same medication, but we still hesitated and returned to our family doctor. He said the thyroid levels might be stress-related and advised not to start thyroid medication yet. Instead, he gave medicines to support immunity along with Sertraline and Chlordiazepoxide (10mg). This time, I started taking them properly.

However, a few days ago, I had strong coffee after taking Sertraline, and it triggered severe anxiety — I felt overwhelmed, numb, nauseous, and cried without control. Because of that reaction, I stopped taking the antidepressants and continued only with the vitamin D and immunity-supporting medicines. My doctor said we will retest after finishing the current medications.

Along with all this, I have been feeling a ticklish sensation in my throat, slight throat pain, and heaviness in my neck, especially when leaning down.

I live in India, and I will be moving to Winnipeg, Canada for further studies on 22nd December.

Mentally, this whole journey has been difficult. I’ve always believed in living to my full potential — eating clean, building a good physique, improving myself, and becoming the best version of who I can be. But now I feel like life pushed me into a battle I wasn’t ready for. I used to be skinny, then built muscle and felt confident, and now I am back to being skinny again — and afraid of gaining fat.

I also feel like my dating life is over before it even began. I’ve never dated anyone because I used to be very introverted. I’ve felt weaker morning erections recently, though they have improved slightly. My testosterone was 5.05 (reference 2–9). I have also masturbated more than usual because of stress.

Right now, I feel lost — like my confidence, body, health, and plans are falling apart. I need some hope and clarity.

**Introduction**

Washing your car isn’t just about spraying it down and calling it good. If you want that deep shine and real protection for your paint, you need the **car detailing** products. There are so many out there, it’s easy to feel lost—especially if you’re new to this. But don’t stress. I’ll break down which products actually matter, why they work, and how to use them so your car looks sharp every time.

 **What’s Car Detailing Anyway?**

Car detailing goes way beyond a regular wash. You’re cleaning, polishing, and protecting every part of your car—inside and out. The goal? Make your car look brand new, keep every surface protected, and hold onto that shine for as long as you can.

The right tools make all the difference. Here’s what you’ll want in your kit.

**Essential Exterior Car Detailing Products**

**1. pH-Balanced Car Shampoo**  

**Skip the dish soap.** Car shampoos are gentle and won’t mess up your paint.  

**When to use:** Washing without scratching your paint.  

**Quick tip:** Try the two-bucket wash method to keep dirt from getting rubbed back onto the car.

**2. Microfiber Wash Mitt**  

Way better than a sponge. Microfiber mitts lift dirt off your paint so you don’t end up with swirl marks.  

They’re super soft, reusable, and easy to wash.

**3. Clay Bar**  

Washing alone leaves stuff behind. Clay bars pull out those stubborn bits and leave your paint feeling smooth.  

Just make sure to use it with clay lubricant.

**4. Car Polish**  

Paint looking a little tired or scratched up? Polish brings back the shine.  

You can use a polishing pad by hand, or go for a machine if you want to get serious.

**5. Car Wax or Sealant**  

Wax adds that final glossy layer and keeps the sun and dirt off your paint.  

It lasts a couple of months. If you want protection that goes even longer, check out ceramic coatings later on.

**Must-Have Interior Car Detailing Products**

**1. All-Purpose Cleaner (APC)**  

This covers almost everything—dashboard, doors, vinyl, you name it.  

Stick with water-based ones for a clean, fresh finish.

**2. Glass Cleaner**  

Pick one that’s ammonia-free for streak-free, super clear windows.

**3. Upholstery & Fabric Cleaner**  

Coffee spills? No big deal. These cleaners handle stains on seats, carpets, and even the roof.  

Use a soft brush to keep your fabric safe.

**4. Leather Conditioner (for leather seats)**  

Nothing makes a car look old like cracked leather. Conditioner keeps it soft and looking new.  

Just apply every few months.

**Why Quality Products Matter**

Cheap cleaners aren’t just a waste—they can actually mess up your paint, fade your dash, or leave swirl marks everywhere. Good products mean a deep clean, a bright shine, and real protection from sun, dust, and scratches.

Think of it like skincare for your car. The better the product, the better the results.

**Beginner’s Shopping List**

* **Car Shampoo**—For safe, gentle cleaning  
* **Microfiber Mitt & Towels**—For scratch-free washing and drying  
* **Clay Bar**—For deep paint cleaning  
* **Polish**—To bring back the shine  
* **Wax or Sealant** – For protection and gloss  
* **APC**—For every interior surface  
* **Glass Cleaner**—For clean, streak-free windows  
* **Leather Conditioner**—To keep seats soft (if you have leather)

Start with these basics. Once you get the hang of it, you can try more advanced stuff like paint correction or ceramic coatings.

**Final Thoughts**

If you’re just getting started with car care, the right products make a world of difference. Start simple, nail the basics, and watch your car start to turn heads. Honestly, once you see that shine, it’s hard not to get hooked. Your car will thank you for it.

A normal day for me is like… wake up, drink a coffee that costs 8 lei if I make it at home or 12 lei if I’m too lazy and grab one on the way. Breakfast is whatever’s cheap that week, usually eggs or some random pastry because they’re still like 4–6 lei and honestly hit way harder than they should. I work a normal job, nothing fancy. After taxes I take home like 3.000–3.500 lei depending on the month. Rent? 1.200 lei for a one-bedroom that definitely saw better days. Utilities bounce between 300 and 500 lei depending if winter wants to ruin me or not. Internet + phone around 70–80 lei. Food… I try to stay under 600–700 lei but let’s be real, that number has been creeping up like a horror movie monster. But here’s the weird part. Even with all that, I’m still here. Still kinda… fine? Like yeah, money is tight as hell. One car repair and I’m eating bread with air for a week. Last month my clutch started sounding like a dying goat and the mechanic quoted me 900 lei. I almost ascended spiritually. But then there are these small things that make the whole struggle feel less insane. Random villages where time moves slower. A full plate of sarmale for like 20 lei. A bus ride across town for 3 lei. Markets where old ladies sell tomatoes that taste like summer and not plastic. Neighbors who mind their business until the day you actually need something, then suddenly they’re family. It’s messy. It’s cheap and not cheap at the same time. It feels like the country is held together with duct tape and stubbornness. But I had this moment last week, walking home with groceries that actually didn’t cost my entire paycheck, and I thought… yeah, there’s still something here worth staying for. So now I’m curious what it looks like for everyone else.

I had every symptom yoy can possibly think of especially the neurological ones with the dp/dr, extreme panic attacks, loosing touch with reality, dread, suicidal ideation that didnt feel like my own thoughts, ocd, extreme depression. I also had fatigue to the point that didnt go away. I couldn't go in public because my nerbousystem would go insane. Wasnt able to go in a car or drive for the first 2 years. 
 
What helped me the most was actually addressing mast cells. I noticed when ever I would eat my symptoms would get insane. Especially alcohol or coffee would send a severe flair up to the point I thought I was going to die. I tried many antihistamines at first but was reacting even to the antihistamines themselves. I did an elimination diet for a while and had a reduction of symptoms but wasnt compeltely healed. I eventually did a microbiome test which showed 0 bfido bacteria and lactobacillus. I had an overgrowth of bad bacteria as well. Im assuming I was dealing with candida and mold because I had those exact symptoms. Long covid seems to have the same symptoms as CIRS.

I started slowly adding probiotics. Im talking about 1/8 of the dose. Slowly working up to a full dose over the course of a month. That seemed to really start helping my system. Unfortunately the first thing you need to do to feel better is to stop the MCAS. Without doing that, youe immune system will be in constant attack mode. The drugs that worked the best for me for this was oral ketotifen (you can get this on many online sites that you basically fill out a questionnaire and pay a bill and they send it to your house or you can have your allergist or dr perscribe it for you). The second drug is called remeron or generic metrazapine. It is considered an ""anti-depressant"". In all realty the drug is one of the strongest antihistamines you can possibly take. It also helps raise seretonin and norepinephrine in the brain. You take one pill at night time and honestly have almost complete resolving of symptoms the next day. It is very similar to trazadone which both of these meds are used for falling asleep. 

Once your able to get your mast cells under control, then you can work on bringing your gut back to health. When you do this make sure you are taking binders multiple times a day. I find pectasol to be the best one for me since it actually gets into the blood. Covid seems to destroy all the good bacteria leaving you with overgrowth of the bad stuff including candida. This leads to leaky gut, an immune system that feels threatened, and a constant high level of histamine because those organisms also release histamine. People do not realize how drastic histamine can effect your cognition, emotions, your nervousystem, your personality, and your gut.",14,1765014315.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

Hi,

I wanted to ask for some opinions regarding the value of the upgrade from the DF64V grinder to the Varia VS6 grinder, and how meaningful of an upgrade it is.

For background -

I have a brewing setup that goes like this:

For espresso, a Profitec Pro600 machine, with a DF64V grinder.

For filter coffee, which is mainly Aeropress with a flow control filter cap and V60, I had a Wilfa Svart grinder, which broke down.

So now I am stuck between the choice of upgrading my main grinder and repurposing the DF64V for filter coffee, or just get a new grinder for filter coffee. In the first case, the Varia VS6 is my only real purchasing option simply due to grinder availability in my country and my price range.",1,1765014201.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

You, the Battle Bunny, the kick-’em-in-the-face hero… are now in a… thing… with the literal king of all villains… because you both got your feelings hurt by a BuzzFeed article?”","The café was aggressively cute, all floral patterns and dainty china, a stark contrast to its two patrons. Outside, a small crowd had gathered, not for the coffee, but for the pro-hero Mt. Lady, who was doing her best to sip a latte without smashing the tiny cup in her massive hand. Across from her, Mirko was demolishing a plate of carrot cake with a ferocity usually reserved for villain takedowns.

“So,” Mt. Lady said, leaning forward and causing the table to groan in protest. “Spill. The gossip channels are on fire. You versus Endeavor’s agency? They’re saying you’ve snapped. That you’ve got a secret villain boyfriend. That you’ve been possessed by the spirit of a particularly sassy vandal.”

Mirko snorted, licking frosting off her thumb. “Which one do you believe?”

“Honestly? The possession one sounded plausible. You’ve been weirdly… cheerful.”

Mirko took a long drink of her water, her rabbit ears twitching. She glanced around the café, then leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Okay. You’re my best friend. You cannot breathe a word of this to anyone. Not a soul. Or I’ll kick you into next week.”

Mt Lady’s eyes widened. “Uh oh. This is a good one, isn’t it?”

“The best.” Mirko took a deep breath. “So. That ‘Canonically Hot’ list came out.”

“Ugh, don’t remind me. I was number seven. Seven. Behind Momo? A child?! The disrespect!”

“Right? Well, I wasn’t on it at all.”

Mt Lady nearly dropped her cup. “What?! That’s a crime! I’ll sue them!”

“And get this,” Mirko said, her grin turning wicked. “Neither was All for One.”

The color drained from Mt Lady’s face. Her gigantification quirk seemed to flicker for a second, making her shudder. “The… the All for One? The… face-stealing, century-old super-villain All for One?”

“The very same. In his… prime form. Which is, and I say this with complete professional objectivity, stupidly handsome.”

Mt Lady’s jaw was hanging open. “Rumi… what did you do?”

“We got pissed. And then we got wasted. Like, ‘see-through-time’ wasted. Ended up at the same bar bitching about it. Bonded over shared indignation.” Mirko’s grin was downright feral now. “And then we decided to go trash Endeavor’s agency.”

The sound that escaped Mt Lady was a cross between a gasp and a squeak. Several people outside the window jumped. “YOU TRASHED ENDEAVOR’S AGENCY WITH ALL FOR ONE?!”

“Shhh!” Mirko hissed, though she was laughing. “Yeah. It was epic. Spray paint, chocolate milk fountains, the works. I may have… flashed his security cameras.”

“You mooned the Number Two Hero’s security system?!” Mt Lady clapped a hand over her mouth, her eyes sparkling with horrified delight. “I’m gonna faint. Keep going.”

“So we wreck the place, have the time of our lives, and I wake up the next morning in his stupidly luxurious penthouse. Naked.”

“NO.”

“Yes.”

“NEXT TO ALL FOR ONE?!”

“Next to All for One. Also naked. And let me tell you, for an ancient evil, he’s got—“

“DON’T!” Mt Lady yelled, slamming her hands over her ears before remembering her strength and almost knocking herself out with her own palms. “I don’t want the image! I can’t have that image in my head! The Symbol of Evil… au naturel!”

Mirko cackled, slapping the table. “Then the HPSC hauls me in. Endeavor is there, looking like he’s about to have an aneurysm. I lied my ass off. Told them I had an evil twin.”

Mt Lady was wheezing, tears of laughter and shock streaming down her face. “They did not believe that.”

“Not for a second! But what were they gonna do? Arrest the Rabbit Hero for having too much fun? Anyway, I get out, and guess who’s waiting for me in a limo darker than his soul?”

“This is the best story I have ever heard in my entire life,” Mt Lady whispered, utterly rapt.

“It gets better. We tracked down the blogger who wrote the list.”

“You didn’t.”

“We did. Made him write a retraction. We’re now joint number one. It’s canon.”

Mt Lady finally lost it. She threw her head back and laughed, a full-bodied, booming sound that rattled the café windows. “You… you terrorized a nerd… to get on a hot list… with All for One!”

“Pretty much!” Mirko said, beaming with pride.

Mt Lady wiped a tear from her eye, her laughter subsiding into hiccups. “Okay. Okay. So. Just to be clear. You, the Battle Bunny, the kick-’em-in-the-face hero… are now in a… thing… with the literal king of all villains… because you both got your feelings hurt by a BuzzFeed article?”

Mirko thought about it for a second, then shrugged. “Yeah. That’s it. It’s not a ‘thing’-thing. It’s more of a… strategic alliance based on shared pettiness and devastating hotness.” She finished her cake. “And the sex is phenomenal.”

Mt Lady choked on her own spit. “I didn’t need to know that!” she coughed, but she was still grinning. She shook her head in utter disbelief. “You know, most people get a new haircut when they have a crisis. You start a war against the hero ranking system and sleep with the devil.”

Mirko leaned back, looking supremely satisfied. “What can I say? I’m an overachiever.” She flagged down a waiter. “Another carrot cake! And my friend here is gonna need something stronger than latte. We’re celebrating.”

“What are we celebrating?” Mt Lady asked, still dazed.

“My new number one ranking, obviously,” Mirko said with a wink. “And the fact that we’re officially the hottest, pettiest power couple in history.”

Mt Lady just shook her head, a slow smile spreading across her face. “I need to get better friends. Or worse ones. I’m not sure which.” She raised her tiny cup. “To chaos, I guess.”

Mirko clinked her water glass against it. “To chaos.”",3,1765013968.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,1,1.0,False

Context:

I just started interacting with my crush a month ago, thanks to a friend who knows that I have feelings for her. At first, it was just me being around her without really talking. About a week later, we were casually talking with friends and workmates. She suddenly pointed out that I’m a quiet person and that I smile every time after I say something.

We have a daily routine where we grab lunch together, I treat her regularly, and we go home together. After a month of this, we became closer. Here are some behaviors I’ve noticed:

She treats me differently from her other male friends.

She laughs and smiles whenever I look at her.

She gave me a nickname.

When I surprised her with coffee because she was working a 12-hour shift and I couldn’t be there, I asked my friend (who is also friends with her) to deliver it. She kept asking him where I was multiple times, told him to tell me that I made her day, and reportedly turned really shy and blushed, thanking me repeatedly.

Whenever we go home together and are quiet, I sometimes feel her looking at me in multiple ways: looking, smiling, grinning, or biting her lip. I noticed this through my peripheral vision. Whenever I catch her looking, she smiles, laughs, and says nothing, even if I ask why.

She shares personal things with me, including family matters, insecurities, her thoughts, plans, and future goals.

She fed me once when she wanted me to try her meal.

She once asked me something like “Free ka na?” which I didn’t fully understand at first. I just nodded and said yes, and she responded with a wide smile.

There was a time when she was chatting with a friend, and the friend asked if I was her boyfriend. She said, “Yes, that’s my boyfriend,” and doubled down when asked again.

She told me I’m dependable because I have everything she needs literally, things she might need day-to-day.

She said I should be around more often because whenever I am, it feels like most of her problems go away.

She sometimes puts her belongings, like her phone, in my pocket or bag.

I helped her with something she had been saving up for, and when I reminded her she could claim it immediately, she turned pink, got shy, and thanked me multiple times.

She kept asking me about my perfume and said it smells really good, adding that she’s been noticing it for a while now.

Based on this, do you think she likes me more than a friend? She’s a bubbly, friendly person with people she knows, but I really like her and don’t want to assume that she feels the same way.",1,1765013882.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

I’m sharing experience of the past 3 weeks paying using Moreta. 

We use Moreta in Chiang Mai and I would say we had a 50-60 % luck with merchants having a QR code. It differs very much and seems to follow no logic - nice restaurants will often only have personal QR, while a street coffee stall would have business. It also varies very much depending on markets - for example at University Market and Chaloem park market (seasonal) we managed to pay for everything with QR.

Main benefits IMO:
- free deposits when you put 225 EUR and also it’s instant (via SEPA), so we managed to charge and pay immediately
- very quick
- less need to withdraw / carry cash

Main disadvantages:
- on two occasions the payment seemed not to have been instant and the vendor was confused/asking me to wait or take a photo of the payment
- cca 1% fee on exchange but hopefully that will be waived with the 1% cashback - unfortunately that can only be withdrawn from 5 usd, so once you spent 500
- doesn’t work to pay for police fines :D

Whether you've moved away for work, you're an international Spurs fan, or you just can't get to N17 regularly, how do you keep that connection to the club alive?

With Spurs competing across Premier League, Europa League and domestic cups, there's a lot to follow. Broadcast coverage varies massively depending on where you are, and juggling subscriptions gets expensive. I've found platforms like [Premier League Streaming service](http://antsports.tv/) helpful for reliable streaming without geo-blocking or buffering issues especially for Europa League fixtures that aren't always shown everywhere.

What's your matchday routine? Do you have rituals same shirt, same spot on the sofa, pre-match coffee or pint? Have you found Spurs-friendly pubs near you, or online communities where you can share the chaos with other fans in real time?

And how do you stay engaged between matches any Spurs pods you never miss, YouTube channels breaking down tactics, or journalists you follow for reliable team news?

If you're dealing with time zones, how do you handle early mornings or late nights for live matches versus watching back later?

Usual poop.","So, I've been on Zep for almost 2 months, and I honestly couldn't be happier to see myself actually losing weight again. 

For reference, I've fluctuated between 450 to 500 for the past few years, ever since Covid hit. Before covid was when I was in high school, so all that walking from class to class was my exercise. I was closer to 410 then, and at one point I think I got under 400.

About 2 years ago was when I was like ""Okay, this has to stop, I have to lose weight."" I knew food was my issue, so I tried intermittent fasting, caloric deficits, but every time, I would end up giving up and/or binge eating.

In the past year, I've tried to cut down on food again, but then Doordash gave me half off Dashpass for a year. Eventually, my doctor got me approved for Zep, and while I was hesitant at first because of the other GLP-1 horror stories I heard, I gave it a chance. And god am I glad I did. 

At my first 6-week check, I lost 12 pounds while on 2.5. He moved me up to 5 after that, and while it's been working, I've noticed my stomach has been filling a lot quicker than before. 

I didn't think much of it until this past week and a half, where even normal portions of food are making me feel fuller faster, which leads to accidental overeating and stomach pain. I noticed I wasn't feeling hungry this past wednesday and thursday (the 3rd and 4th of december), but I made myself eat on Wednesday. Totally forgot to eat on thursday. Yesterday (the 5th) I went out to lunch and to see a movie with my grandma, and that's when shit really hit the fan. For lunch I had a pork tenderloin sandwich (not a huge one), some garlic bread, and some fried cauliflower, as well as a drink. I finished my sandwich no problem, but after eating about half the garlic bread (It was like 1 piece cut into 4 slices, so it was 8 slices total) and some cauliflower, I felt bad so I stopped eating and took the rest of the garlic bread home.

After that, we went to the movies and I bought a FNAF 2 popcorn tin that came with an XL popcorn. I shared that with grandma, and we got close to done before I started feeling miserable again, so I stopped and took the rest home. I came to the conclusion that I ate too much in a short amount of time. (This was all over a 3 and a half to 4 hour period) 

I then ended up laying on my right side until dinner (laying on your right side aides in digestion and pill absorption) and still felt miserable when it was time to go. At dinner, I had one piece of bread, two slices of pizza, a cup of coffee and a cup of water. After finishing, I felt like I was going to vomit the rest of the time, so I had to fight that back. Headed back home, immediately laid on my right again to try and settle my stomach.

Now it's after 4 AM, and I got a craving for the rest of the popcorn about 20-ish mins ago. I went to get it, took a few handfuls, and once again began feeling miserable. Obviously I'm pissed cuz I wanna enjoy a salty snack while I watch youtube, so I go to the bathroom to try and make space (as you do), only to realize ""Oh shit, I'm probably really constipated from the Zep, the nurse told me about this.""

Earlier today I was so happy, there was so many things to be happy about as we went and ate at a good restaurant, we got coffee, walked around, basically an eventful happy day, until my mood started switching this afternoon. I feel so sad all of a sudden, and it didnt even happen gradually. My boyfriend started responding to me so coldly (Like 1-2 words responses consisting of Idunno, or just cuz) and it completely shifted my mood and I feel horrible. I also started to feel left out with my family of 5, and the whole day my parents/siblings were talking to each other so I was always walking alone, just using my phone quietly. Just in such a quick moment I felt so alone when I was so happy earlier. My siblings were playing and they needed a 3rd player, they didnt even ask me but asked my father who was using his phone whilst I was just sitting there. My siblings were also playing with the new slime my father brought, and when i went and joined, the youngest started pushing me away how it's a ""2 person game"", and how im suddenly playing with it wrong? It sucks being left out like that as a sibling of 3 (Im the middle child so sibling 1 and 2 have the farthest age gap so its not like they have much similiarities).

I always had a rocky relationship with my mom. She left me with other or myself alot growing up that also resulted in me being sexual abused but she never talked to me about it, But most of my best memories are with others not her. I was pretty independent at a young age. I was making her coffee and waking her up at 7-8 i also knew how to cook on the stove at that age. The first time I remember being blamed about here life was when she got fired and she told me it was because she had to get me. I was in 4th grade then. When we moved since I developed fast i was going through puberty. I was getting bullied and started eating more and gain weight. I was already diagnosed with depression and adhd when she came in and we argued about something when she threw vitamins at me and told me that my fat ass needed the diet pills and im so mean thats why no one wants to be around me.  As I got older she treated me more and more as a kid. She would threaten to call the cops when I was out using her car, when I got raped at my first party at the age of 20 she told me my ass shouldn't been out anyways, whenever we got in a fight she would threaten to kick me out. Now im no saint either cause some of our arguments when I was a teen turned physical.

Now to this situation. Im going to added a new person my brother the bum (m33) i planned moving in with my boyfriend before we found out we were pregnant. The bum took my room when I moved out. Now the bum has been financial cared for by our mom and his LITTLE brother since he was 19 and decided to drop out of  college when he had a full ride scholarship college. He's never kept a job living with our mom. He never paid for rent,bills, or a phone bill. 

He moved back in with our mom and brought his gf (f26) with him. Now they moved back and lived rent free in the apartment that was in my name ending in me now owing 8k with an eviction and at the time I had a 3 month old. She always said I could come back in fact she was telling us to move in so we can save for the baby. When I did call she had me on speaker to ask everyone if the they were okay with it. Then allowed the bum to take the phone and ask when was the last time my bf paid the rent. This is after she promised me that we could have her second car since we got into an accident  and after my bf worked on it she let the bum use it while having his car sit. Because of that i lost my job. While the bum stole from the job she got him and is currently waiting for sentencing for grand larceny. The bum and his gf left willing last year after a few months of bickering when we moved in. Our mom was always on his side. When he did leave he took his car and stole her car for 3 months, blocked her, didn't come to her dad's funeral. But when he finally got evicted from where he went to she let both him and his gf back. I didn't want him here near my child. The first time he got shingles and didn't say anything while still touching and using stuff with a baby that wasn't old enough to get his chicken pox shot. The bum is a selfish person whos only looking out for himself. She brought them into my child's only area to play but will still tell me it's the baby's area. They don't pay rent and she said they were supposed to help out and WASH DISHES since they couldn't pay.

Hence the argument. She asked of I will wash the dishes I said no. I've been the one washing the dishes myself the entire time even before the left. I washed my child's dishes and mine. She tells me I have to wash all the dishes and I said no you said they were supposed to help and they weren't.  They sit drink,smoke, and eat out all day and they can't even pay 250 in rent. They get to go an have sex in my autistic brothers room while he's at work working 12 hours. On top of that she recently bought him a new phone on my account that's under my social after I told her not too and I didn't want to keep having stuff used in my name. I've have the apartment, I had to co sign on a car that got repo and now these phones. She then wanted to talk about how I didn't pay any parts of anything. I paid for the phones, the agreement was since she wanted to add the bum she would pay the whole thing, I paid the electric bill at the apartment until it got to high. I've bought groceries for the house. I've done things and she's here saying I do nothing, that im lazy, that I have mental issues and out of her 4 kids I'm the dumbest one. She threaten to kick us out with the 8k I owe and an 2 yo. She wants all this money that she just told us we were fine not to pay, she threaten to sell the car we bought from her the same car they stole. She did all this cause I wouldn't wash any dishes that I have been doing. Because she brought people back in the house after all they did and didn't even ask us how we feel about it like she did me and to make it worst she did all that in front of them and my bf. Knowing hes the person making the money. She even tried using others to have some control cause im anger about her constantly crossing boundaries then wanna act like nothing happened. Expecting me to get along with her son  someone who spent 2 hours trying to make my bf admit that im an angry person. The same person who tried talking me into leaving my bf and putting him on child support  while I was pregnant.

I know she gotta be but why is it only me. Im the youngest out of them all and the only girl. Unlike my brothers I was raised by her and her only. She knows I have no relationship with my  dad side after the things she said today I can't see her as my mother anymore. I can't take the cycle anymore and im stuck and she trapped us. I can't raise my child in a room he deserves space and my bf don't deserve going through this again with me when he already made it out the cycle ",1,1765012388.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

1pfkxro,https://www.reddit.com/r/PropFirmAuditOfficial/comments/1pfkxro/comparing_forex_prop_firms_fees_rules_platforms/,"Comparing Forex Prop Firms: Fees, Rules, Platforms & Reviews - 2025 Guide","You open your trading app before work, the rupee coffee hasn’t kicked in, and XAUUSD just spiked again. Your plan says “risk 0.5%,” but your heart says “go bigger.” That tug-of-war is why prop firms exist: structured capital, clear rules, and a payout if you trade with discipline. This guide breaks down how forex prop firms work in 2025, the fees and rules that actually matter, and which active firms are worth shortlisting right now.

# What is a Forex Prop Firm & How Does Prop Trading Work

**What does “prop trading” mean in the context of Forex?**

A forex prop firm lets you trade simulated capital under real market conditions and share a percentage of profits when you meet the firm’s rules. You usually start with an evaluation (one or two phases), then move to a funded account that pays a reward share on simulated profits. Firms position this as a skills-for-reward model, not a brokerage service; trading takes place on demo infrastructure, with performance-based payouts.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How do prop firms provide capital and share profits with traders?**

After you pass the evaluation, the firm grants a funded account with a defined profit split (for example, 80–95% in many programs). Payouts are scheduled (often biweekly or monthly) and depend on staying within risk limits. Some firms market higher splits or time-bound payout guarantees; always read the payout policy and timelines on the firm’s site.[ FundedNext+1](https://fundednext.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What are the common models - evaluation-based vs. instant-funding?**

* **Two-step evaluation:** Phase 1 targets a higher profit goal; Phase 2 verifies consistency with tighter risk. Passing both unlocks a funded account.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/pass-the-funded-trader-evaluation-rules-risk-mindset/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **One-step evaluation / “express/stellar” style:** A single target with rules; some firms adjusted or retired older offerings in 2025, so check current availability before you buy.[ FundedNext Help Center](https://help.fundednext.com/en/articles/9929008-what-happens-when-the-trading-cycle-ends?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Instant funding:** Pay a larger fee to access a funded account without a long evaluation; risk rules still apply and profit splits can differ by plan.[ dnafunded.com](https://dnafunded.com/promotions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Quick experience note:** When I tested multiple trials this year, the switch from “trading my cash” to “trading a rule set” was the real unlock. A visible daily-loss cap and a calendar for news events kept me from revenge trades and improved my win/loss rhythm.

# Key Criteria to Compare Prop Firms (Fees, Rules, Platforms, Payouts)

**What kinds of fees and challenge costs to expect from prop firms?**

Expect an upfront evaluation fee that scales with account size. Many firms offer free trials to test the rules and platforms. Watch for add-ons that change splits or resets; confirm what each fee actually buys (platform access, add-ons, or only the evaluation seat).[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/ftmo-free-trial/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What trading-rules and risk limits (daily drawdown, max loss) matter most?**

Two numbers matter every day: **Maximum Daily Loss** (often 5% of starting balance) and **Maximum Loss** (overall cap). Breaking either ends the account. Firms publish clear examples so you can model risk before you trade live. Track how they calculate daily loss (closed + open P/L during the day) to avoid surprise breaches.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/how-to-pass-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Which trading platforms and instruments are typically supported (Forex, CFDs, crypto)?**

The big four platforms in 2025 are **MT4, MT5, cTrader, and Match-Trader**, with some firms also offering **DXtrade**. Most programs allow forex pairs, indices, metals, energies, stocks, and crypto - availability varies by platform and region. Verify your exact platform, symbol list, and any geographic platform limits before paying.[ FTMO+2FTMO+2](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/which-platforms-can-i-use-for-trading/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Quick experience note:** Platform choice changed my fills more than I expected. On days with high volatility, a stable feed and clear depth-of-market on MT5 or cTrader helped my entries, while weaker feeds made me second-guess stops.

# Top Active Forex Prop Firms in 2025 - Who’s Leading the Market

**FTMO - why it remains a dominant prop-firm in 2025**

FTMO runs a two-step evaluation with clear rules on Maximum Daily Loss and Maximum Loss, plus extensive education and tools (like a Mentor app). It supports MT4, MT5, cTrader, and DXtrade, with some regional platform limitations, and allows a wide set of instruments. News trading policies vary by account type; the Swing account has no news/overnight restrictions, while standard accounts have specific conditions around high-impact news. Community reviews in late 2025 still highlight fast support and reliable payouts.[ Trustpilot+7FTMO+7FTMO+7](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**The5ers - positioning for long-term/swing traders & its scaling model**

The5ers focuses on disciplined growth with two-step and other programs designed for consistency. The High-Stakes plan outlines targets and scaling, supports MT5 and now cTrader, and allows holding trades over news but restricts **executing** new orders around high-impact events (±2 minutes). Terms list forbidden strategies like bracketing and certain HFT behaviors.[ The5ers+3The5ers+3Forex Pro Previews+3](https://the5ers.com/high-stakes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**FundedNext - flexible plans, global reach, and trader-friendly features**

FundedNext promotes up to 95% performance rewards on CFDs, supports MT4/MT5/cTrader/Match-Trader, and documents news-trading guidance across account types. In 2025 they updated model availability; check the current lineup before you enroll. Trustpilot feedback in late 2025 points to smooth payouts and busy support queues during peak times.[ Trustpilot+4FundedNext+4FundedNext Help Center+4](https://fundednext.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Other notable firms (e.g., FundingPips, DNA Funded) based on recent rankings**

**FundingPips** supports MT5, cTrader, and Match-Trader, and publishes current rules/terms; public materials and third-party coverage in Nov–Dec 2025 mention mobile apps and ongoing payouts. **DNA Funded** advertises multiple challenge types (1-step, 2-step, rapid, instant) with TradeLocker access and periodic promos; always validate the exact plan details at checkout.[ dnafunded.com+5Investing.com+5FundingPips+5](https://www.investing.com/brokers/reviews/funding-pips/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Quick experience note:** When I compared these side by side, platform availability and news rules were the real tiebreakers. If your strategy needs fast entries around data, The5ers’ order-execution window and FTMO’s account-type differences matter more than a marketing headline.

# Fees & Profit-Split Structures - What Traders Should Know

**Entry/challenge fees vs ongoing costs - typical fee ranges and what they cover**

Expect a one-time challenge fee that scales with account size; most firms offer free trials to test the rules and platforms first. Some add-ons can change the payout split or give “no minimum days.” Be sure you know whether a reset is cheaper than starting a new challenge.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/ftmo-free-trial/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Profit-split percentages after getting funded - what is realistic vs what’s advertised**

Realistic splits cluster between **50% and 80%**, with some firms offering **up to 95%** (CFDs) or special cases for futures. Higher splits may require add-ons or milestones. Check whether the headline rate applies immediately or only after a scaling tier.[ FundedNext+1](https://fundednext.com/blog/prop-firm-payouts-profit-sharing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Hidden costs & fine print: resets, platform fees, withdrawal thresholds**

Scan the legal/terms pages for platform fees, inactivity penalties, payout thresholds, and breach handling. If a firm pays within “24 hours,” check the conditions and exceptions. Always verify rule changes in 2025 pages, not old blog posts.[ FundingPips+1](https://fundingpips.com/en/terms-of-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Quick experience note:** I saved money by using free trials to test spreads and slippage on news days. That dry run showed which platform felt stable on my internet and which symbol list matched my plan.

# Risk Management Rules: Drawdowns, Daily Loss Limits & Trading Restrictions

**Importance of daily loss limits / drawdown caps - how firms enforce risk control**

Daily loss caps (often 5%) and overall loss caps keep risk contained. Firms compute daily loss using both closed and open P/L, so a floating drawdown can breach the rule even if you plan to “let it come back.” Build a buffer.[ FTMO Academy+1](https://academy.ftmo.com/lesson/maximum-daily-loss/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Differences between static vs dynamic/daily-reset loss limits**

Some caps reset each day relative to the start-of-day equity (daily), while overall max loss is static against initial balance. Read each firm’s example page and model it in a spreadsheet before you trade.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/drawdowns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Other restrictions: holding times, allowed instruments, trading during news, strategy limitations**

Check:

* **News windows** (e.g., The5ers restricts order execution ±2 minutes; FundedNext has account-specific windows; FTMO Swing has no news restrictions).  
* **Holding overnight/weekend** rules and swap costs.  
* **Forbidden strategies** (HFT, latency arbitrage, bracketing around news).  
* **Symbol list** and leverage by asset.[ The5ers+3The5ers Help Center+3FundedNext Help Center+3](https://help.the5ers.com/is-news-trading-allowed-in-the-high-stakes-program/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Quick experience note:** A two-minute or five-minute freeze around CPI sounds small until you test it - it changes entry style. I moved from breakouts to pullbacks to stay within the rule and cut slippage.

# Platform Support & Instruments - Trading Tools and Market Access

**Common platforms offered (e.g. MT4, MT5, cTrader, proprietary platforms)**

In 2025, active leaders support **MT4, MT5, cTrader, Match-Trader**, and in FTMO’s case **DXtrade**. Confirm regional restrictions (for example, some users cannot use MetaTrader or cTrader and must select alternatives).[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/which-platforms-can-i-use-for-trading/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What asset classes are typically allowed by prop firms (Forex pairs, commodities, crypto, indices, etc.)**

Most firms allow forex majors/minors, gold and metals, indices, energies, and often crypto - subject to each platform’s symbol list. Check the firm’s FAQ for the instruments enabled on your chosen server.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/which-instruments-can-i-trade-and-what-strategies-am-i-allowed-to-use/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How platform stability, data feed quality and execution speed affect trader experience**

Fast, stable connections and clean data reduce slippage and rule breaches during spikes. If your strategy relies on depth-of-market or algorithmic testing, MT5 and cTrader features can help. Use free trials to benchmark execution on your local setup before paying for a challenge.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/ftmo-trading-platforms/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Quick experience note:** I timed order-to-fill on my home Wi-Fi vs. office fiber. The better connection plus MT5’s DOM view gave me cleaner entries on gold during London open.

# Reputation, Reviews & Payout Reliability - What Community & Data Say

**Why checking community feedback, payout history and user reviews matters**

Public reviews capture payout speed and support quality across many users. Late-2025 Trustpilot pages show current experiences for FTMO, The5ers, FundedNext, and FundingPips. Skim the most recent posts and look for replies from the company.[ Trustpilot+3Trustpilot+3Trustpilot+3](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ftmo.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Red flags: over-promising, lack of transparency, restrictive conditions**

Be cautious with vague payout promises, unclear news rules, or terms that penalize normal trading patterns. Read the legal/terms pages and the rule FAQs before buying.[ FundingPips+1](https://fundingpips.com/en/terms-of-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How to verify if a firm is legitimate and currently active**

Check the **official website** for updated programs, **FAQ/rules pages**, recent **blog or help-center posts** with 2025 dates, and **Trustpilot** for current user feedback. Confirm platform availability (MT4/MT5/cTrader/Match-Trader/DXtrade) on help pages, not third-party summaries.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/which-platforms-can-i-use-for-trading/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Experience note:** I treat this like due diligence: official site first, terms second, Trustpilot third. If dates look outdated or links are broken, I move on.

# FAQ 

# Reputation, Reviews & Payout Reliability - What Community & Data Say

**Why checking community feedback, payout history and user reviews matters**

Recent reviews give a live read on payouts, support speed, and platform stability. As of December 2025, Trustpilot pages for FTMO, The5ers, FundedNext, FundingPips, and DNA Funded show fresh user comments and company replies. Read the most recent posts and scan how the firm responds when issues are raised.[ Trustpilot+4Trustpilot+4Trustpilot+4](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ftmo.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Red flags: over-promising, lack of transparency, restrictive conditions**

Watch for vague payout language, unclear news-trading rules, and terms that penalize normal execution. Check each firm’s rules/FAQ pages and confirm platform availability before you pay for a challenge. Use official pages for FTMO, The5ers, FundedNext, FundingPips, and DNA Funded to verify 2025 changes.[ dnafunded.com+9FTMO+9FTMO+9](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**A quick word on review platforms in late-2025**

Trustpilot faced public allegations from a short seller in early December; the company denied the claims. Treat all review sites as one input among many and cross-check with firm policies and real-time community forums.[ Reuters+1](https://www.reuters.com/business/review-platform-trustpilots-shares-slump-after-grizzly-research-shorts-stock-2025-12-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Quick experience note:** I now read three things in order: the firm’s rules page, the latest Trustpilot reviews, and a community thread that mentions payouts in the last 60 days. That mix filters out stale claims.

# Are these firms trading real capital or simulated accounts?

These programs run on demo infrastructure with simulated funds and performance-based rewards. FTMO and FundedNext state this clearly on their sites.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What platforms are active in 2025?

The common set is MT4, MT5, cTrader, Match-Trader, and in some cases DXtrade or TradeLocker. Check the firm’s platform page for your region. Examples: FTMO (MT4/MT5/cTrader/DXtrade), The5ers (MT5, adding cTrader), FundedNext (MT4/MT5/cTrader/Match-Trader), FundingPips (MT5/cTrader/Match-Trader), DNA Funded (TradeLocker).[ dnafunded.com+6The5ers+6FTMO+6](https://the5ers.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What are typical risk limits?

Across leading programs, a 5% maximum daily loss and 10% maximum loss are common. FTMO publishes these parameters with examples. Always confirm the exact calculations (closed + open P/L).[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/watch-out-for-open-losses/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Can I trade during high-impact news?

Rules vary. FTMO’s Swing account allows news and overnight/weekend holds. The5ers allows holding over news but blocks order **execution** two minutes before and after high-impact events. Some firms mark “soft breaches” during that window where profits don’t count. DNA Funded restricts funded-stage trading within a 10-minute window around major releases per its 2025 rulebook.[ dnafunded.com+4FTMO+4The5ers+4](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/ftmo-swing-account-type/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# How do I check if a firm is current and active right now?

Verify on the official site: programs page, rules/FAQ, and a dated update or blog in 2025. Then scan recent Trustpilot reviews and a forum thread with payouts reported in recent weeks. Use multiple sources, especially when policies change.[ FTMO+2FundedNext+2](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What instruments can I trade?

Most active firms allow forex pairs, indices, metals, energies, and often crypto, depending on platform servers. Confirm on the firm’s instruments or FAQ page.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/high-stakes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Where do “high-impact” news labels come from?

Many rule pages reference the Forex Factory calendar’s “red” events. If your strategy works near data, keep that calendar open and filter for high-impact releases.[ The5ers Help Center+2The5ers Help Center+2](https://help.the5ers.com/can-i-trade-during-news/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What profit split is realistic?

Headline splits can reach 90–95% on some plans. Realistic take-home after add-ons and thresholds often sits between 50% and 80%. Read the payout policy and thresholds on the firm’s site before you buy.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/ftmo-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What are common hidden costs?

Look for resets, platform surcharges, inactivity fees, and payout minimums. These details are in the firm’s terms or fees documents, not on the homepage. Example: DNA Funded posts fee schedules and rules PDFs with 2025 dates; FTMO and The5ers host detailed FAQs.[ The5ers+3dnafunded.com+3dnafunded.com+3](https://dnafunded.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DNA-Funded-Schedule-of-Assessment.docx.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Any credible signals from trader communities?

Forum threads and review hubs can flag shifts fast. Use them for context, but validate on the firm’s site. A single Reddit post with allegations is a data point, not a verdict.[ BabyPips.com Forum+1](https://forums.babypips.com/t/members-feedback-on-funded-next-prop-firm/1273002?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",1,1765012099.0,PropFirmAuditOfficial,0,1.0,False

1pfkwmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1pfkwmx/key_difference_between_will_and_henryvecna/,Key difference between Will and Henry/Vecna,"Vecna (or rather Henry Creel) was permanently changed after he went to Dimension X as a young child. He was there for 12 hours. He had powers after. Overall, he'd been a quiet ""sensitive"" child who felt different (before even going to Dim X). His birthday is 22nd of March.

  
Will, on the other hand, was never in Dimension X but the merged parallel world (the ""bridge""), the Upside Down. He was there for a week. 14 times longer than Henry. He got particles fed into him and was impregnated with a Demo (..sort of, I always thought a part of that thing that got shoved down his throat just latched onto him). 

Later shown in season 2, his mind was still connected to the MF, he tried to run at first, then he decided to stand his ground. But he was too weak mentally (didn't accept himself/didn't know who he was). So the MF took over. He was not only fed with particles physically, but was engulfed in them mentally as well.

Will was also called a sensitive and different child (by Joyce in s1). His birthday is also March 22nd.

But here is the key difference between the two: Will grew up with love around him. His family, Mike, Dustin, Lucas. He had things to lose. Henry didn't. And I think this will play a major role in defeating the Mindflayer.

Vecna (or the MF talking through him) doesn't understand the power of love/connection between humans (interpersonal communication basically). It sees it as a weakness bcs it makes a human vulnerable.

But it can empower them too. Which is exactly what happened with Will in ep. 4 of season 5. He got support from different sources (his mother, Mike, Robin) and also himself. He accepted who he is. Through self acceptance, a person is unstoppable (in my book). 

Henry unfortunately was never able to get to this point mentally.

Another thing I noticed is that Will is way more powerful than Vecna. I believe he isn't channeling Vecna's powers but the Mindflayer's.

I should also mention I've never watched the play, so maybe I'm missing some details here and there, but still we have 4 seasons (and a half) of material to go through. 

What I do know is that Henry met his love, Patty, who he almost killed. But Patty seems to be alive? 

I fear there is going to be a parallel scenario, Will = Henry, Patty = Mike.

  
I think I ended up confusing myself here but if any of you have a more structured analysis and theory in mind, please share 💀

I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1pfkulv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1pfkulv/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 06/12/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamTrades](https://www.steamtrades.com/user/76561198074920693)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1pfkubb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scavengerhunt/comments/1pfkubb/bachelorette_scavenger_hunt_success_story_what/,Bachelorette Scavenger Hunt Success Story - What Worked & Tips,"Just wrapped up a bachelorette weekend where we did a custom scavenger hunt through the city, and it was honestly the highlight. Wanted to share what worked in case anyone's planning something similar!

**The Setup:**
8 people, mixed personalities (introverts + extroverts), different energy levels. We wanted something more memorable than the usual bar crawl.

The maid of honor created a hunt that took us to places meaningful to the bride - where she met her fiancé, her favorite coffee shop, the proposal spot, etc. Each location had a clue that led to the next.

**What Made It Great:**
- Everyone engaged naturally (even quiet friends loved solving clues together)
- We discovered stories about the couple we'd never heard
- Perfect photo ops at each meaningful location  
- Could go at our own pace - grabbed drinks when we wanted
- Budget-friendly (just walking around the city)
- About 3 hours total

**Setup Tips:**
- Include inside jokes in clues
- Mix difficulty levels (some easy, some challenging)
- End somewhere special (we ended at their wedding venue)
- Use photos from their relationship as hints
- Test the route timing beforehand

**Tech Made It Easy:**
She used Scavenge.rs to put everything on our phones - no printed papers or envelopes. Each person could see the clues, and it tracked our progress.

**Questions I Got Asked:**
- *Did everyone stay together?* We split into 2 teams of 4, which made it more fun/competitive
- *What if someone gets lost?* The app had all locations marked, easy to catch up
- *Weather backup?* We had indoor locations mixed in

Has anyone else done scavenger hunts for bachelorettes or other events? Would love to hear creative variations!",1,1765011716.0,scavengerhunt,0,1.0,False
1pfktsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1pfktsd/last_ditch_attempt_for_advice/,Last ditch attempt for advice,"Hi all, I’ve had severe insomnia that worsens around my period (bug is present all month round) and is awful if I dare to even think about needing to get up to do something the next morning. I’ve tried every sleeping pill, antidepressants, melatonin, CBD oil, magnesium, CBT-I, sleep restriction, intensive psychological therapy, every adjustment to my nightly routine, giving up caffeine, every technique I can think of…nothing helps. I’d hoped to try my last resort Daridorexant (which is fairly new where I am) but I’ve discovered I’m allergic to an ingredient in the coating and can’t take it so I’m devastated.

I am so incredibly depressed. I normally just force myself to do the things I’d planned or go into the office on no sleep, and only daytime sleep (and subsequently nuke any semblance of any carefully and painstakingly created routine) when I absolutely have to. Like that I physically wouldn’t be able to work on my PhD thesis (which has now been submitted) if I didn’t nap from 10am when I finally crashed out till like 1pm. Just stealing just enough sleep to function constantly. But doing this ruins every plan I ever make. Plans go from things I’m excited about to me just pushing through and wishing for them to end because I’m too exhausted to enjoy myself. 

I am at the point of suicide to be blunt. My life isn’t worth living. I’m midway through two weeks of annual leave and the first week has been absolutely ruined. I’m already looking at the plans I’ve made for the second and thinking why bother even trying? There’s no joy any more. I now have severe panic attacks at like 5-7am after trying my best all night to sleep when I finally realise it isn’t happening. And then I’ll tire myself out and fall asleep for an hour or two (I allow it now just to stop the agony and terror) and upon waking I immediately go back into a panic attack because my day is ruined and I’ve lost any and all sense of a life. I look at others who can just go for coffee with a friend well-rested (or even just on 3hrs of sleep) and could just cry. 

The panic attacks are becoming really traumatic and I literally lose my mind. Sometimes I feel I should be hospitalised. I’ve called for medical help but there literally nothing else I can try and I seem to be sensitive to loads of meds. I’m limited in terms of antidepressants for instance because I sweat so severely on all of them that it’s hard to even leave the house, so that is pointless. I get scared of the dark now and struggle to tolerate it because o find the long quiet nights triggering. I’m facing another day ruined by it and I don’t want to be here. It severely limits my life, I’m constantly a hollow, corpse like shell of myself. Ive run out of options…

Has anyone been this severe and come back from it? Or found a desire to keep living? I just can’t any more and each night I don’t sleep tips me closer. I was meant to celebrate submitting my PhD thesis tonight…5 years of work…instead of being excited for going out with my best friends this evening, I know I’ll be too exhausted to enjoy it unless I try and grab a midday nap (which will mean I continue to not sleep because even a 1hour nap means I don’t sleep that night). My life is just constantly ruled by sleep and I’m at the point I don’t even think it’s worth trying another day

I just got my first espresso machine - the AVX Hero X (also known as MiiCoffee Apex V2 or Turin Legato V2). However, I’m having issues dialing my shots. I will insert a pic of the blend that I’m using. The shots are always sour. I have a DF54 grinder, started at setting 15 and slowly went down. However, at a certain point grinding finer resulted in a very slow shot (first drop after 10” and total time idek, 40” or something) and it was STILL sour. Now we got a VST basket and it’s definitely better because the flow rate is faster so we can go way finer (especially with other, more basic beans), but still a bit sour. Am I missing something? I’ve tried temperatures from 92 to 96 degrees celsius. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! Good to note that when I did a course on a commercial machine, I was pulling nice shots, so I don’t think my technique is that bad (?)

She called me up last month, absolutely panicked. Just bought a 4BHK in DLF, probably cost her close to 4 crores, and she’s standing in this blank space crying because she has no idea what to do with it. Her words were literally “I feel like I’ve made a huge mistake.” She didn’t make a mistake though. What she needed was a luxury interior designer in DLF Gurgaon who actually knew their way around these properties and genuinely gave a shit about making her feel at home instead of just impressing her with some trendy design nonsense. That’s where I came in. That’s what being a real[ **luxury interior designer in DLF Gurgaon**](https://urbanscope.in/) is about.

That’s what got me into this business honestly. It wasn’t because I dreamed of being an interior designer since I was five. It was because I saw my parents buy this beautiful house and hire someone who basically turned it into a showroom. My mom hated it. She felt uncomfortable in her own home. So I dragged my dad to fire the designer and I said “let me try.” I was maybe 25, completely clueless, but I listened to what my mom actually wanted instead of what I thought looked cool. And you know what? It turned out amazing. My parents still live in that house thirty years later and they still tell people their son designed it.

That’s when I realized – this isn’t about being a designer. It’s about being a listener and someone who genuinely cares about how people live in their spaces.

# Understanding Luxury Interior Design in DLF Gurgaon

# What Makes Luxury Interior Design Different

Alright so here’s what pisses me off – people throw the word “luxury” around like it means something. You see these Instagram accounts with all these pristine, perfect rooms that nobody actually lives in. They’re like museums. Nobody’s watching TV in those spaces, nobody’s eating dinner there, nobody’s having a bad day and just collapsing on the couch with a glass of wine.

Real luxury? That’s completely different. That’s walking into a space and feeling like you can breathe. That’s sitting on your sofa and thinking “this is exactly where I want to be right now.” That’s your friends coming over and feeling welcome and comfortable instead of like they’re in some fancy hotel lobby where they can’t touch anything.

I had this meeting last year with a couple, right? Super wealthy, they could buy whatever they wanted. And the husband told me something that stuck with me. He said “I don’t want to feel like I’m living in a catalog.” That hit me because that’s what happens when designers prioritize looking good over feeling good.

When I start working with someone, I’m asking all kinds of weird questions that probably don’t sound like designer questions. I want to know – do you have kids? How old? What do they do? Are they messy? Do you have pets? What’s your work like? Are you stressed or relaxed when you come home? Do you cook? What’s your biggest complaint about your current space? What time do you wake up? Do you like natural light or do you hate it? What’s something that makes you genuinely happy?

These questions sound random but they’re everything. I had a client tell me she had chronic migraines and certain kinds of artificial light made them worse. So suddenly the whole lighting plan changed. We’re not putting in standard ceiling lights, we’re looking at specific types of LEDs that don’t trigger migraines, we’re maximizing natural light, we’re avoiding fluorescent anything. That’s luxury – creating a space that actually works for your body and your life.

I had another client who was a night owl and his wife was an early bird. They were fighting about bedroom lighting constantly. So we installed these individual lighting systems – she can have bright morning light to wake up, he can have complete darkness. Sounds simple but that one thing probably saved their marriage, honestly. They both said as much.

# Why DLF Gurgaon Demands Specialized Design Expertise

Listen, I love DLF Gurgaon. I’ve designed probably over a hundred apartments here. But it’s not like designing in a regular residential area. These are completely different animals.

First of all, the people living here are not average. They’re business owners, they’re CEOs, they’re doctors, they’re artists who’ve made it big. They’ve got taste, they’ve got standards, and they’re not going to accept mediocre work. One client I worked with was a woman who ran a fashion brand. She had very specific ideas about aesthetics and she knew good design when she saw it. She’d also lived in Paris, Milan, New York. She wasn’t going to be impressed by something that looked good in a magazine if it didn’t actually work.

The buildings themselves are tricky. DLF has these massive windows in some apartments which is amazing – incredible natural light. But that light is also intense. In summer, some apartments get blasted with heat starting at 1 PM. You need to know how to manage that. You need the right window treatments, the right colors, the right materials. I once had an apartment where the afternoon sun was so intense that the client couldn’t use her living room after 2 PM without the AC working overtime. We solved it by installing these smart films on the windows that rejected heat, we chose lighter colors on the walls to reflect more light, we used specific types of upholstery that don’t absorb heat. Suddenly she could use her living room comfortably in the afternoon.

Then there’s the open-plan layout thing. Most DLF apartments are designed with massive open living-dining-kitchen areas. Which is beautiful but also challenging. How do you create distinct spaces without putting up walls? How do you make the dining area feel like a dining area and the living area feel like a living area when they’re technically the same room? I’ve had to get creative with flooring changes, ceiling details, strategic furniture placement, lighting design that defines spaces.

I worked with one family who were terrified about the open plan because they have teenage kids and they wanted the kitchen to feel separate so they could cook without feeling like they were performing for the kids in the living room. We created this subtle visual separation using a custom bookcase that wasn’t a full wall but was substantial enough to define the spaces. They could still see into the living area, still hear what the kids were doing, but suddenly cooking felt private. They were so happy.

One more thing about DLF – these people have specific lifestyles. I’ve designed apartments for a guy who’s a serious wine collector, and we had to create a temperature-controlled wine room. I’ve designed for a woman who’s an artist and needs specific lighting and wall space for her work. I’ve designed for a family with three kids under 8 who needed durability and smart storage without sacrificing elegance. Each situation is completely unique and requires someone who actually understands luxury residential design, not just someone who can make things look pretty.

# The Luxury Interior Design Process

# Initial Consultation and Understanding Your Vision

So I’ve been doing this long enough that I can tell you – the first meeting is everything. I spend anywhere from 2 to 4 hours with a client initially, and we’re not in my office with mood boards. We’re in their apartment, in their space, actually talking.

I’m observing everything. How do they move through the space? Where do they naturally sit? Are they comfortable or are they perching on the edge of furniture? Do they spend time by the window or do they avoid it? Are their walls bare or covered with art? Do they have lots of books or hardly any? Are there family photos everywhere or none? Are there plants? Is there a collection of something – art, vintage cameras, wine bottles, whatever?

I’m also asking questions that might seem totally unrelated to design. “What’s a typical day like for you?” “What time do you get home?” “What’s the first thing you do when you walk through your door?” “What would be your ideal evening?” “Where do you feel most relaxed – have you stayed somewhere that felt perfect?” “What’s one thing about your current space that drives you crazy?” “What’s something you absolutely never want to see in your home?”

I had this meeting with a guy who mentioned offhand that he works from home and takes meetings on Zoom. Suddenly I’m thinking about his background – does he want it to look professional? Does he want it hidden? Does he have clients from around the world who might see Indian architecture? That one comment changed how I approached the entire space.

I’m also not shy about pushing back. If someone says they want something that I think won’t work, I tell them straight up. I had a client who wanted to paint her small bedroom a deep burgundy because she loved the color. Now, normally a small dark room gets smaller and darker with that color. So I explained that to her, I showed her examples, I talked about how it would feel in the space. And you know what? Instead of getting mad, she appreciated the honesty. We ended up doing a compromise – we painted one feature wall in burgundy and the rest in a lighter complementary color. Her bedroom turned out absolutely stunning, and she loved it because it felt like exactly what she wanted but executed in a way that actually worked.

I also spend time just sitting in the space. I’ll sit in the living room and imagine furniture arrangements. I’ll stand where the kitchen is and imagine cooking there. I’ll lie on the bed and look at the ceiling. I’m getting a feel for the space and trying to understand how the client experiences it.

# Space Planning and Layout Optimization

This is where I basically become obsessive. I’ve spent entire days in a client’s apartment, just walking around at different times, observing.

I want to understand the natural flow. When someone comes home, which direction do they naturally walk? Do they go to the kitchen first, the bathroom, the bedroom? How do they move through the space when they’re relaxed versus when they’re entertaining guests? Where do people naturally congregate when there are people over? Which corner gets ignored?

I had this one open-plan apartment where the client’s family wasn’t using the dining area at all. Everyone kept ending up in the kitchen. I asked why and she said it just felt natural. So instead of fighting that, we redesigned the space to embrace it. We made the kitchen the main gathering area, we put a large island with seating, we created a casual dining situation rather than a formal dining room. Now the family actually uses that space and loves it. If I’d just designed a formal dining room because that’s what most open plans have, it would have been wasted space.

I’m also thinking about flexibility. Is the space going to change? Are kids going to grow up? Will someone start working from home? Will they move their exercise equipment in? Good design shouldn’t be so rigid that you can’t adapt to changes in your life.

I spent hours in this one apartment figuring out how to make a home office that didn’t scream “office.” The client worked in finance and did client calls from home, so he needed it to look professional. But he also didn’t want his home to feel like a corporate space. We created this really nice office nook in one corner of the master bedroom using custom furniture that looked beautiful but also closed up at night so it wasn’t visible. He could do his Zoom calls during the day and the space looked like home in the evenings. Perfect solution.

# Material Selection and Sourcing

Okay so this is where my two decades of industry relationships actually matters. I know people. I have vendors I’ve worked with for years. I know a marble guy who sources incredible pieces from Italy. I know a fabric distributor who holds new collections for me. I know craftspeople who will turn down other projects to work on mine because we have that kind of relationship.

But here’s what’s important – I only recommend things I’ve actually used or tested. I’ve made mistakes. I once recommended this gorgeous light-colored fabric for a sofa thinking it would look elegant and sophisticated. Within 6 months it was stained and dingy because of Delhi’s dust. I learned my lesson the hard way. Now I’m way more strategic about fabric choices, especially in Delhi’s climate.

Delhi is brutal on materials. The sun is intense, the dust is everywhere, the humidity in monsoon is crazy. I’ve seen marble get stained, paint get discolored, upholstery get damaged. So I think carefully about what will actually hold up. I had a client who wanted a light-colored upholstery and I steered her toward something that was stain-resistant and easy to clean rather than something that looked beautiful but was high-maintenance. She appreciated it, especially once her kids spilled juice on the couch and it came right off.

I also think about the individual client’s lifestyle. One client is obsessively clean and doesn’t mind maintaining high-maintenance pieces. Another has two kids and a dog and needs durability above all else. Another is busy and travels constantly and wants beautiful but completely low-maintenance. These differences completely change what I recommend.

I had this one project where we found this incredible marble for the kitchen island – beautiful, sophisticated, exactly what the client wanted aesthetically. But it was porous and would stain easily. The client’s lifestyle? She’s got three kids under 10 and works full-time. She’s not sealing marble every month. So instead of recommending that marble and then watching it get destroyed, I found a different marble that was equally beautiful but naturally non-porous. She never even knew about the first option because I filtered it out based on knowing her actual life.

# Project Management and Execution

This is where so many designers screw up. They create a beautiful design and then disappear. The execution is everything. I’ve seen gorgeous designs ruined by poor construction, and I’ve seen mediocre designs salvaged by excellent craftsmanship.

I’m on site at least twice a week during construction. I’m checking quality, making sure contractors are actually following specs, solving problems as they come up. And problems always come up – that’s just reality. Maybe the electrician installs an outlet in the wrong spot. Maybe the painter uses the wrong sheen. Maybe the contractor takes a shortcut somewhere thinking nobody will notice.

I had this project where the contractor tried to cut corners on the flooring installation. I noticed immediately and made him redo it. It cost extra but the flooring is literally under your feet every day – it has to be perfect. I’m not letting someone half-ass that.

I also coordinate between different trades. The sequencing matters. You can’t install flooring before the walls are done. You can’t install furniture before the flooring. I’m managing all of that so there’s no chaos or inefficiency.

I send photos to my clients constantly during construction. I’m not one of those designers who vanishes and then presents the finished product like it’s a surprise. I send photos with captions explaining what’s happening. “We’re installing the kitchen today, here’s how the tiles are being laid.” This keeps people informed and reassured that I’m paying attention to their investment and their home.

I had a project that hit a snag – the contractor found a structural issue that required additional work and cost. I could have just passed that along to the client and said “too bad.” Instead, I negotiated with the contractor, found creative solutions, we got creative with how we approached the problem, and we only ended up passing a portion of the extra cost to the client. That’s taking care of people. That’s project management.

# Key Elements of Luxury Interior Design

# Lighting Design Excellence

Okay I’m going to be really honest – lighting is the thing that separates good design from bad design more than anything else. Most people get it completely wrong. They think “I need a nice chandelier” and they slap it in the middle of the ceiling. That’s not lighting design, that’s just putting a fixture there.

Real lighting design requires understanding how light affects mood, how it changes colors, how it can make a space feel bigger or smaller, warmer or cooler. It’s genuinely complex.

In DLF apartments, you often get these massive windows with incredible natural light during the day. But at night, that’s when your lighting design either makes or breaks the space. You need layers – ambient lighting for general illumination, task lighting for specific activities, accent lighting to highlight things you want to draw attention to.

I work with a lighting consultant on many projects. We’re planning every single light source – what type of bulb, what color temperature, whether it should be dimmable, where it goes. We’re creating scenes so that you can adjust the mood. Morning – bright, energizing light to wake you up. Dinner time – warm, intimate light. Late night – soft, relaxing light. A good dimmer system lets you move between these scenes easily.

I did this project where the client had an art collection and we spent literally weeks figuring out the lighting. Too bright and it damages the art. Too dim and you can’t appreciate it. We ended up using specific LED lights that were color-corrected to not damage the pieces but still showed them off beautifully. That level of detail matters in luxury design.

I had another client whose apartment got intense afternoon sun that was actually uncomfortable to be in. So we installed smart blinds that close automatically during the peak heat hours, combined with strategic lighting that made the space feel bright and open even with the blinds partially closed. It was a technical solution to a practical problem.

# Custom Furnishings and Decor

I love commissioning custom furniture. There’s something special about working with a craftsperson to create exactly what you envision instead of settling for what’s available in stores.

I have relationships with furniture makers who can create almost anything. One client wanted a sofa that was super deep and comfortable but also sophisticated – like, you could sink into it but it didn’t look like a sectional from a college dorm. We worked with a craftsperson to create exactly that. Another client had weird dimensions in their living room so we had a custom entertainment unit built to fit perfectly.

But I’m strategic about budget. I tell clients – “You can custom commission this sofa because that’s where your life happens, but let’s source the bedroom furniture from quality retailers.” Or sometimes it’s the opposite – “This bedroom wardrobe is custom, everything else we source smartly.”

I had a client who was an interior design enthusiast herself and wanted her home to look magazine-worthy. So we did custom everything – custom sofa, custom beds, custom cabinetry. It was expensive but it was exactly what she needed. Another client wanted to be smart with money so we did a custom sofa and kitchen, then sourced quality pieces for everything else. Both approaches work if you’re intentional.

The craftspeople I work with are amazing. I had this one guy make a custom sofa for a client and when it arrived, one seam wasn’t quite perfect. I sent it back and he remade it completely without charging extra because he cares about his work. That’s the kind of partnership I have with these people.

# Color Psychology and Palette Development

Choosing colors isn’t something I do casually. I spend time in the space watching how light changes colors throughout the day.

North-facing rooms are completely different from south-facing. East-facing gets beautiful morning light. West-facing gets warm afternoon glow but also intense heat. All of this affects how colors actually look and feel in the space.

I’ll bring paint samples and fabric samples and sit with them for hours, watching them change throughout the day. What looks gorgeous at 10 AM might look terrible at 4 PM. I’ve seen clients pick a wall color in a showroom and hate it in their home because they didn’t account for their specific lighting. I’m obsessive about testing colors in actual light conditions.

I’m also thinking about psychology. Cool colors make spaces feel bigger but colder. Warm colors make spaces feel smaller but cozier. Bold colors can energize or overwhelm depending on how much you use them. Neutrals can feel safe or boring depending on how you execute them.

I had this client who wanted her bedroom to feel calm but also sophisticated. She loved jewel tones but most designers would probably steer her away from something bold in a bedroom. I went with a deep, rich emerald green – sophisticated, beautiful, but muted enough to feel calming. With the right lighting and furnishings, it became this incredibly serene, luxurious space. That’s the kind of color thinking that comes from actually living with design choices for years.

# Technology Integration

Modern homes need technology but here’s what I’ve learned – the best technology is invisible. You shouldn’t see it unless you’re specifically looking for it.

Smart homes are trendy but they can be frustrating if there are too many controls. I work with tech specialists who help me integrate everything so it just works. Smart lighting that adjusts based on time of day. Climate control that learns your preferences. Entertainment systems that are intuitive. Security that’s unobtrusive.

One client had this minimalist aesthetic and didn’t want to see any evidence of technology. So we buried all the wiring, hid the outlets, integrated the smart systems so everything worked in the background. She can control everything from her phone or voice commands but there’s zero visible tech cluttering the space. That’s luxury.

I had another client who was terrified of smart homes, thought they were too complicated. So I set up a simple system that basically worked automatically – lights adjusted themselves, temperature regulated itself. He didn’t have to think about it, it just worked. Now he can’t imagine going back to regular homes.

# Why Choose a Professional Luxury Interior Designer?

# Expertise and Industry Knowledge

I’ve been doing this for almost twenty years. I’ve designed hundreds of spaces. I’ve made mistakes, lots of them, and I’ve learned from every single one.

When I recommend something, it’s based on real experience. I’ve lived with my design choices long enough to know how they perform. I know which finishes hold up and which don’t. I know which layouts work and which feel weird after you’ve lived in them for six months.

That expertise saves clients money because I steer them away from expensive mistakes. I had a client who wanted to do a very trendy design, all the Instagram aesthetics, and I gently pointed out that trends move fast. Instead, we incorporated trendy elements in ways that could be easily updated without redoing everything. It’s been seven years and her home still looks beautiful and current, not dated like some trendy designs do.

I’ve also lived through enough market changes to know what’s going to work long-term versus what’s a phase. I’ve seen certain materials become fashionable and then completely fall out of favor. I’ve learned what holds value and what becomes a regret.

# Access to Exclusive Resources

Over the years, I’ve built genuine relationships with suppliers, craftspeople, manufacturers, all over India and internationally. When a client works with me, they get access to things they wouldn’t have on their own.

My marble supplier in Italy sends me photos of slabs before they’re cut so I can select the perfect piece. My fabric distributor holds new collections for me before they’re released publicly. My furniture craftsperson will turn down other projects to prioritize mine because we’ve worked together for fifteen years. These relationships matter.

I had a client who wanted a specific type of wood for kitchen cabinets and this wood wasn’t readily available in India. But I knew a supplier who had it and I sourced it directly. That kind of access is worth the investment in working with an experienced designer.

I also get priority on limited pieces. When something special comes in, I know about it before it hits the market. I can hold pieces for clients. I can negotiate better pricing because I’m ordering regularly and in volume.

# Time and Stress Savings

Designing your home is genuinely stressful. You’re making permanent or semi-permanent decisions. You’re spending a lot of money. You’re dealing with contractors and vendors and a million details.

When you work with me, I handle all of that. You don’t have to think about whether materials were ordered correctly or whether the contractor is showing up or whether installations are being done properly. That’s my job. You get to wake up one day and see your beautiful home.

I had a client who was so stressed during the project that she was having trouble sleeping. I told her “stop worrying, that’s literally why you hired me.” By the end she said that was one of the best parts – being able to hand over the stress and just see the magic happen.

# Investment Protection

Your home is your biggest financial investment for most people. A well-designed, well-executed interior adds real value. Beyond that, it makes your daily life better.

My choices are always strategic. I’m not recommending trendy things that will look dated in five years. I’m creating spaces that will feel beautiful and functional for a decade or more. When my clients eventually sell their homes, they consistently get better prices because the interiors are well-designed.

# Working with Urban Scope for Your Luxury Interior Design

I’m going to be straight with you – I’ve worked with a lot of different people and teams in this industry. Urban Scope is one of the few I genuinely respect. And I’m not saying that because I have any financial relationship with them or because we’re friends or because I’m getting paid to say this. I’m saying it because when I see their work, I see the same philosophy I believe in – that design should serve the people living in the space, not the designer’s ego.

They actually do their research. They listen to clients. They deliver thoughtful, personalized work. They understand DLF Gurgaon properties specifically – they know the buildings, they understand the light patterns, they get the clientele. If you’re serious about finding the right designer, go check out their work at [https://urbanscope.in/](https://urbanscope.in/) and see if it resonates with you. Reach out to them and have a real conversation. Ask them about their process. Ask them about working with DLF properties specifically. See if they’re asking the right questions about your lifestyle. That’s how you know if you’ve found the right partner.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# What is the typical timeline for a luxury interior design project?

So this depends completely on the scope. If you’re completely redesigning your entire apartment from start to finish, we’re talking anywhere from five to nine months. That’s consultation time, design development, sourcing time (which takes forever if you’re doing custom pieces or hunting for specific materials), construction, installation, finishing touches.

If you’re doing something smaller – just a bedroom or a home office or a kitchen – you’re looking at two to four months. But here’s my philosophy – I refuse to rush. I’ve done rushed projects and they’re stressful and the quality suffers. I’d rather tell someone “this will take eight months” and deliver something incredible than rush to meet an arbitrary deadline and deliver something mediocre.

I also build buffer time into projects because things always come up. The marble arrives late. There’s a structural issue the contractor didn’t expect. A fabric order gets delayed. These things happen. If you’ve got buffer time, they’re not disasters. If you’re scheduled to the minute, they become nightmares.

# How much does luxury interior design cost?

Honestly? It depends completely on what you’re doing. Every project is different. The cost depends on how big your space is, what condition it’s in, what materials you’re choosing, whether you’re doing custom work, what your specific challenges are.

I’ve done projects in DLF that cost 15 lakhs and projects that cost 3 crores. The difference is usually the scope of work and where the client decides to invest their money.

Here’s my philosophy – I talk about budget upfront and I’m honest about what things actually cost. I don’t surprise clients with costs later. If someone has a budget of 20 lakhs, I work within that. If they want to spend 50 lakhs, that’s fine too. The key is being clear from the beginning.

I also believe in strategic spending. You don’t need to spend equally on every room. Maybe you invest heavily in your master bedroom because that’s your sanctuary. Maybe you’re more economical in the guest bedroom. That makes complete sense.

# How do I choose the right luxury interior designer for my DLF Gurgaon property?

This is so important because you’re going to be working closely with this person for months. Start by looking at portfolios. Don’t just look at whether they’re pretty – think about whether you’d actually want to live in these spaces. Do they feel like homes or like sterile showrooms?

Read testimonials, but more importantly, try to actually talk to past clients if you can. Ask them about the process, not just the final result. Was the designer responsive? Did they listen when something didn’t work? Were there surprises at the end or was everything communicated clearly?

When you meet with a designer, pay attention to whether they’re genuinely interested in understanding you or just trying to impress you with their portfolio. Do they ask questions about your lifestyle or do they just talk about themselves? Do they listen to your concerns or do they dismiss them?

I’ve had clients tell me they chose me specifically because I said something like “I don’t think that’s going to work for your lifestyle and here’s why.” They appreciated the honesty more than if I’d just said yes to everything to close the deal.

# What’s the difference between a luxury interior designer and a regular interior designer?

It really comes down to experience and philosophy. A regular designer might help you pick paint colors and arrange furniture. A luxury designer thinks deeply about who you are and what you actually do, and creates a space that serves your life.

Luxury designers have access to materials and craftspeople that regular designers don’t. We’ve worked on enough high-end projects to understand what quality actually means. We know how to source and manage premium materials. We have the experience to anticipate problems and solve them before they become issues.

It’s like the difference between eating at a casual restaurant and going to a fine dining restaurant. Both are restaurants but the level of thought and detail is completely different. One is about feeding you, the other is about creating an experience.

# Can a luxury interior designer work within my budget constraints?

Absolutely, and honestly I prefer working with clients who have clear budgets. When I know exactly what you’re comfortable spending, I can be smart about allocating resources.

Maybe you want to invest in a beautiful kitchen because you love cooking, so we do a high-end kitchen and we’re more economical with other spaces. Or maybe you want incredible lighting throughout because that’s what makes you feel luxe, so we prioritize that. It’s about understanding your values and allocating budget according to what matters to you.

The thing is, luxury doesn’t require unlimited money. It requires thoughtfulness and intention. I’ve created beautiful, luxurious spaces on reasonable budgets by being strategic about choices and not wasting money on things the client doesn’t care about.",0,1765010594.0,interiordesignideas,1,0.5,False

1pfkhwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/1pfkhwv/i_seem_to_have_had_a_seizure/,I seem to have had a seizure,"So, I was hanging out and chatting with some friends online. I meant to look up something and was feeling increasingly confused. I had done enough insulin to cover 20 carbs, and sort of forgot, but I ended up eating at least 15. 

My Dexcom transmitter expired a few weeks earlier and I was having a hard time managing my glucose since I was used to a CGM. I kept sleeping with 50-65 glucose and getting hypos when I'd walk somewhere.  I feel I got some hypoglycemic unawareness.

Anyway, it seems I texted my friend ""wow I am feeling really confused"" about 11 o'clock. I woke up at 11:40 feeling super confused about where I was and what I'd been doing. I was in a hotel room and had no idea where I was or how I got there. It seems I spilled a drink and the coffee maker was on the floor.  

I noticed I had a sore spot on the side of my head, and I bit the end of my tongue, which still feels numb 2 days later. All my muscles are sore and the weirdest thing is I have no idea what happened as I have no memory of it.",3,1765010363.0,diabetes_t1,2,0.81,False

However I get so hungry, all the time. It's not a diet thing, I exercise and watch what I eat and eat a LOT of protein, I could have a full plate of rice and minced beef and fibers and anything that is supposed to make me feel full and will be hungry half an hour later.

The constant feeling of hunger is really getting to me since I started watching what I eat. I need some advice on how to suppress it. I drink coffee to help with hunger but it's just not enough anymore. No matter what I eat I'm always hungry. I really need some help. 

Does anyone know some methods to suppress appetite while on SSRI's ? Or just in general because I can't even ""trust my gut"" on wether I'm hungry or not. ",4,1765010315.0,loseit,2,1.0,False
1pfkgsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pfkgsf/queer_awakening_first_real_crush_at_19_non_fiction/,Queer Awakening & First Real Crush At 19 [Non Fiction],"So, as a queer boy who is still discovering himself, I haven’t had any TRUE crushes, up until college year 1. Yup, up until THEN I thought I liked some people but they were more admiration rather than sexual and (and or) emotional attachment. And it’s a story of pushing boundaries, some-what warmth, gambling, anxious attachment styles, you know it. Name it and it’s probably here.

Anyway, I guess I should start from the beginning. It all happened when I, out of curiosity decided to go to a mall I NEVER have before. I won’t name it for obvious reasons, but I decided to go there. After some time and trying a few stores out, I was slowly coming to the end of my trip, which happened to be, IN a market. A big, and only one market which had a coffee shop.

I enter the market, and to the left, is the indented wall, with the coffee shop, I don’t know if I explained that correctly but what you need to know is that you HAD to TURN after entering the shop to see it. And so I did. Oh. My. God. Orange bobbed (like a short bob, but sexier) hair, black shirt, tattoos covering the forearms, and a white and orange pants with a swirl effect. In a town of conservatives and boring style, HE hit me like a FUCKING truck. Also he was tall, and that mattered too. Me, being the gay boy that I am, I looked at him, and up at the menu. Him, the menu, him, the menu, him, the menu until he turned around suddenly. I approached and picked a drink, literally the first think I saw once I looked at the menu. And from the first encounter I guess he kinda saw me…

And now, for the second time. A few days later, idk how, maybe a week, I went there again, but this time, I get a little shock. HE REMEMBERED ME! He, before punching the order in, asked me: “How’d you like the last drink I made?” and I was struck. He spoke in a very cheerful but slow, carefully picked way. The way he looked down at me and smiled, I could not get it out of my head. Now it’s a little blurry but at the time, phew… I muttered, “I loved it” and got on with my order.

Third order, another week later, he prepared the same thing, but this time, started to chat a little. He asked me how I was which caught me off-guard. Literally no barista in my life has ever tried to chat with me. Especially not someone who was THIS hot. I don’t remember what we chatted about but I muttered and fumbled my way through. But he kept smiling, he handed me my drink and, well, I went on.

You get the idea. Later times, I mustered up the courage to ask for his Instagram which he gave me without question. We texted straight for 3 days. He called me cute and said that ‘I looked like someone who had found their style’ and stuff. We chatted some more about society, beauty, whatever.

Now, at the time, I was quite obsessed at the **idea** of him. Why? Because when you go through puberty with no emotional attachment to anyone what-so-ever, the first one you go through, it’s like being suffocated at the idea of breathing for the first time. And I found him, so hot at the time because of both how he was, personality wise and how he looked.

So anyway, we chat and whatever for a while, mostly at his workplace. Now, this sounds dumb, and it is, why’d you always chat there of all places when you can meet up at a cafe? I asked the same question too! But this guy, wouldn’t budge! He always kept putting up an excuse or just said he had some work. He was also a tattoo artist, on top of being a barista, so, I took it for what it was, he was a busy guy! He’d sometimes show me his designs or whatever, which is cool and all.

After some time, we got to learn a lot about each other. He was %100 homo, or so he told me, and gave some, sometimes sex eds. No, yeah! Sex eds! He taught me how to like, navigate some stuff safely and all. Also, I feel like I should add, I was early-19 at the time, he was 22-23. Make of that what you will. He was genuinely someone I looked up to. Since even people at the mall, they found him fucking magnetic! No wonder! He was effortlessly charismatic, he could change the room’s temperature at his will. And, I was bewildered. He was THE person who I confirmed my bisexuality with. Or to, rather. Idk.

A month or two, but this guy, still won’t fucking meet up. But one day! We get lucky. I go by his work place at 3pm. And he says he leaves early and doesn’t have much to do and that he’d love to go out with me! Bingo! But guess what? GUESS WHAT? GUESS FUCKING WHAT? A FUCKING 6.3 magnitude earthquake happens and I go home…

And sometimes, I left with a bad taste in my mouth. He seemed to sometimes raise me and sometimes put me down, and at the time, I couldn’t tell if he was genuinely flirting or just being a little too friendly or just sometimes, weird (or mishandled) banter. Just, take a look at what he said/texted me sometimes bro.

“I’ll be here if you need me 🧎‍♂️”

“I’ll always be here if you need it (drink).”

“You’re special.”

“You know, the when you asked for my insta I thought you’d ask me to marry or something, like a kid.” I’m kind of paraphrasing but you get the idea.

“I hold you above most people…”

“Look around, these people are all fucking dumb, it’s only people like us who are better.” I know it’s like, out of context, so you’re free to interpret them with a grain of salt. BUT ME? DELUSIONAL ME at the time? The highs and the lows, I rode them like a drunk horse. I have no clue what the fuck that means, but, I FELT him. Like, I genuinely wanted more. But at the same time, I felt like I didn’t want to open up about my intentions because I didn’t want to lose him, he was one of the only people who knew about my queerness. You know the environment isn’t friendly of that! Especially to the ones of his expressionism and colourfulness. In hindsight, you know he wasn’t in love with me… Maybe he liked me, but certainly didn’t see romantic potential but at the time, I kind of didn’t want to consider that possibility.

So anyway, some time later, it gets somewhat blander. Not, like less sparkly or hatey, just, I guess I enjoyed his presence and he did mine. And we could talk all sorts of shit, taboo or not. Random erections, kinks (he told he, explicitly, that he was a sadist and that that’s actually why he liked tattooing people. He dragged the sentence too.), life, partners or whatever. But one day, I get kind of shooed off by the person running the thingy, which I understand and, at hindsight, I fucking THANK you lady. You literally SAVED me from this pit. Anyway, I leave, right? A little pissed off (the manager is totally right by the way, I would’ve done exactly the same thing), I go to a starbucks, far away from \*there\*. And I, for the last fucking time, invite him to have a coffee. He says that he could meet me between his shifts/breaks. Which 30 minutes, by the way and I still have to drag myself over to his ass. I don’t know what went through me, I actually know I was angry, I put a soft block. Removed him as a follower, unfollowed him. Boom, done.

Now, at the time, it felt reliving, right? I didn’t have to put up with that shit any more. AND OH BOY, DID THE WITHDRAWAL COME SWINGING. Heartbreak, sometimes sobbing, feeling unloved, unlovable, heartbroken, down. I was curling in my bed at night, plotting ALL sort of scenarios in my mind: “I know! He just loved seeing me suffer! He loved it!”, or “Manipulative… idiot!” or “Maybe I should’ve opened up! Maybe I should’ve said something! Fuck me!” and on and on and on…

I’m gonna lay it straight: he lived in my head, rent-free, for MONTHS. That shit genuinely did something to my brain. But anyways, in hindsight, I think he liked me, as a friend, not as a lover, but maybe you can see it from my perspective: he was a fucking asshole for not snuffing that hope out early, BECAUSE YOU COULD TELL I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM, COME ON. MY EYES WERE GLOWING when I looked at him. I do think he was an ass for that, but other than that, I don’t think he was doing this ‘because he was a sadist’ or whatever. I just think he liked NOT being bored at work! I just think he liked my presence, maybe he felt better about himself when he was around. He didn’t “enjoy my pain”.

Maybe I should’ve been more firm about my boundaries, but DUDE I WAS IN LOVE. I wanted to see him CONSTANTLY. And I wanted him to see me.

So, a few months later, just as I was “slowly getting over him”, I was walking home from a trip, a little out time I had. It was slightly rainy at 7 pm. I walking down a bridge. And guess who I see? Mr 6’3, leopard pants I saw 99 other times, boots, cropped coat, those lips, those cheekbones and that nose. He was wearing a hat and trying to light up his friends, I mean his “Friend”s cigarette. I walked by and holy fuck, at the time I felt a deep heartache, like a legit chest pain for a moment. My breathing got irregular, time slowed down and I was on the verge of hyperventilating. At the time, I was like, “I WISH YOU SAW MEEE!!” but now, I’m kind of like: “I DODGED A FUCKING BULLET. THANK GOD.” CAN YOU IMAGINE JUST HOW MUCH MORE DWELLING ANY INTERACTION WOULD’VE COSTED ME. Imagine you lookin’ for closure after THAT and he hits you with:  
“It was weird.”

“I didn’t know.”

“You’re blowing it out of proportion.”

“You’re crazy.”

“I never felt that way.”

“You came to me, I never stepped a foot in your direction.”

I know I’m literally making this up but he COULD’ve said these.

And the stalking, it’s something else. You know, before meeting him, I always shook my head at the thought of looking at someone’s profile over and over and over again. A friend, who knew I knew him, sent a link, saying “Look who I found!” and it’s his fucking Tik Tok page with 5-6-ish videos. You can imagine the rest, maybe, lol. After a few, weeks of just going to incognito mode on Firefox and going to his profile I kind of realised, and legitimately, without much judgment, tried to put all the pieces together, until one night it hit me.

**We were both unstable. And that was the truth. I mean, given our spaces, it’s no surprise. He wanted someone to be with, but he just didn’t want all the baggage, and was never aware of how much I was carrying because of how full his life was. Maybe he didn’t want to snuff that hope out because he WANTED me to stick around for him. Sometimes acting cold, sometimes pushy, sometimes really warm, sometimes enticing, it felt like a dice roll or a casino game. I was no good either. Not letting him know of how much effort I was putting on, not backing off properly, even though I was in love. A part of me always felt guilty but god damn it, I loved him so much at the time.**

**Both grey people, blurred boundaries, stretching meanings, shrinking meanings, pushing weird boundaries, somewhat unaware of the story behind the fence that holds each other’s intentions and feelings.**

1pfkgg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1pfkgg0/starting_to_feel_like_an_aesthetic_friend/,Starting to feel like an “aesthetic” friend,"Hi, so I’ve been friends with this girl for almost six years now and we’re pretty close but as of lately I’m wondering if I should cut her off or talk to her about how I’ve been feeling. For context, we’re both 22 and I’ve been unemployed for some time, but my partner is taking care of me for the time being. She’s working and in school. I understand as adults it’s harder to hang out with all of our responsibilities and in this case, I have more free time than her. So when we do make plans, I go out of my way to pay for some of her drinks/ food/ ubers whatever it may be. 
To start off, she had this concert for a band she loves that she invited me to a couple months back, and ofc I was happy to join her. I paid for my ticket, we planned to split the Uber cost and I even had my partner pick us up on the way back, ( S.N. she never asks her partner to be DD). A month later, I invite her to a concert, but she said she didn’t want to go because of the ticket cost which I understood. I planned to just go alone. The day of the concert, she was checking to see if ticket prices went down and they did I believe they were like $50-$80 but she was waiting to see if they’d lower and eventually they sold out. That’s when I started to get irritated with her. She seemed to want to go and I would’ve paid for the ticket but I realized I’m always open to paying for her when it came to hanging out so I didn’t offer. It just rubbed me the wrong way that when she wants to do something I’m always open to it and go out of my way to make things smoother. She said she would’ve gone to her band concert alone, but now it feels like she invited me so she wouldn’t have to pay for 2 $30+ Ubers.

Fast forward to last week, we were supposed to hang out and I text her and ask if she’s up for it still, she said she didn’t know yet bc It’d be after she gets off work so she didn’t want to say yes and cancel. I tell her that’s okay I’m just going alone, and we can reschedule for another day that works best for her. The morning of she texts me that she thinks she’ll be okay to go out so I decide to wait for her which was around 4pm. Since I was going alone I had planned to go to a candle making class and have lunch somewhere near by. She asked how much the class would be which was $30 and later said she didn’t know about going out anymore because of how much she’d be spending just out and about. So I tell her I’m just going alone like I planned to, and we can do something after if she’d like. I was a little annoyed bc she got my hopes up that she’d be joining me so I waited for her and now it was later than I wanted it to be. So while I’m out she texts me that she just got off work and she wishes that she went and I tell her she can still join me for happy hour but she said it’s better she didn’t go bc she’d be spending then later she told me she was going Christmas shopping with her partner. That kinda rubbed me the wrong way, we had potential plans for the day but she cancels and then goes out with her partner. I would’ve been happy to do something more casual or hang out at each other’s houses if she didn’t want to spend and I would’ve brought drinks or food but okay. Anyway, that night I invite her out dancing, it was Black Friday so it was free entry and I offered to pay for drinks and have my partner be DD, but she said she didn’t feel like going out. 

I’ve been so sad because I’m realizing I’m doing so much just to hang out with her. I work around her schedule, I’m open to doing anything she wants to do, I offer to pay for things, just to make our hang outs happen. We’re supposed to hang out later this month but I don’t know if I want to go anymore. She’s reading a new book and I suggested we have a book club in the future. She said “ I don’t know if we have the same taste”, but I told her I’ll read anything and she told me to read the book she’s currently reading since she had just started. She said she wants to get the physical copies so It’d be a cute photo op when we hang out. Me being excited I go and order us the books and tell her I got it and I offer to make cute cards to go with it. Anyway, I don’t know if I’m feeling the hang out anymore. I love her, she’s been my close friend for so long but I’m starting to feel used. I’m starting to feel like she hangs out with me because I’m her “aesthetic” friend and she wants to go somewhere nice and take pictures. I’m very flexible. I’m open to doing anything, going to a casual restaurant, coffee shop near by, even at home idc about going to nice places every time. Yes it’s nice, but I care more about seeing her. I would pay for her if she doesn’t have it at times obviously but I realized she rarely pays for me, even when we do something inexpensive. What should I do?!


P.S She has other friends who she hangs out with casually but with me it’s almost always nice cocktail bars/ aesthetically pleasing activities that I enjoy doing not just for the looks. She’s more laid back in a way, but if she can’t afford it, I’m happy to do something casual and when we do go somewhere lately I’ve been paying for some of her drinks/ the more expensive apps that we split for example.",1,1765010192.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Made effort to meet customers in person when traveling. 8 meetings over the year.

What I learned that I couldn't learn on Zoom:

How they actually use the product. Watched over their shoulder. Saw workarounds I didn't know existed.

What's on their desk and screens. Sticky notes with competitor names. Other tools open I should integrate with.

Their real problems beyond my product. In person, people share context they won't type. Office politics, budget constraints, career pressures.

Body language around features. Genuine excitement vs polite tolerance looks very different.

Three product insights came directly from in-person visits:

A workflow they all did manually that I could automate (became a key feature).

A competitor I'd underestimated (they all had it installed too).

A pricing objection nobody mentioned on Zoom (too expensive for their budget cycle timing).

Logistics that worked:

Coffee shops near their office. 30-60 minutes. Keep it casual.

Brought my laptop to show upcoming features. Got immediate unfiltered feedback.

Asked to see them use the product for 10 minutes. Most valuable part of every meeting.

Paid for their coffee. Small gesture, builds rapport.

It's expensive and time-consuming. But 8 in-person conversations gave me more insight than hundreds of digital interactions.

Next year I'm budgeting for more of these trips.

How often do you meet customers in person?

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Week 1: Join 5 Meetup groups (hiking, board games, book club), RSVP to 2 events this week, prepare conversation starters.  
Week 2: Attend 2 events, initiate conversations with 5+ people per event, exchange Instagram/phone numbers with 2-3 connections.  
Week 3: Attend 3 events (mix of groups), follow up with Week 2 contacts via text, invite 1-2 people for coffee outside Meetup.  
Week 4: Attend 3 final events, solidify 5 friendships through one-on-one hangouts, create group chat with new friends.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Meetup event check-in screenshots — proof of attendance at 8 events with timestamps.
2. Text message screenshots (names redacted) — showing conversations and plans with 5 different people.
3. Photos from one-on-one meetups — 5 separate coffee/lunch meetings outside organized events (faces can be blurred for privacy).

Social anxiety at events → attend with accountability partner first time, prepare 3 conversation starters, arrive 10 min early to ease in.

Schedule conflicts → prioritize weekends, block calendar every Saturday for Meetup events.

1pfka5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/neworder/comments/1pfka5v/new_interview_with_radio_x_new_album/,New interview with Radio X - New album!,"# Radio X Exclusive: The Art of Not Caring: A Coffee with New Order's Bernard Sumner

​**MANCHESTER, UK** – Bernard Sumner, the quiet force behind New Order (and before that, Joy Division), arrives in a Manchester cafe looking less like a globally influential musician and more like a man contemplating his next sailing trip. Clad in a simple jacket, his manner is polite, private, and refreshingly uninterested in rock-star theatrics. We sat down to discuss songwriting, the long shadow of the past, and why analysis is the enemy of longevity.

# ​The Creative Force and a New Dimension

​**Q:** You’ve been open about songwriting not always coming easily, often calling it an intense process. How has that evolved over the decades, and how do you sustain that creative energy?

​**BS:** It’s changed. I used to be the bloke who sat down with a guitar and strummed until something came out. Now, I record **micro snippets** of ideas on a recorder—I’ve got hundreds, probably—and I have to sit down and actually assemble them. The initial idea is the easy part; it’s an inspirational moment. The real work is making it all stick together.

​I won't lie, being the main **creative force** behind New Order for the past **40 years** has been incredibly hard work. It's draining sometimes.

​**Q:** And in all those years, did you ever feel that external factors or influences were holding the music back?

​**BS:** Definitely. Looking back, there were periods where the music of New Order was held back by **certain bad influences** within the band's environment. Not necessarily musical influences, but things that created a negative atmosphere or put unnecessary barriers in the way of the creative process. It was frustrating because I felt we had so much potential that we couldn't always fully realise due to those dynamics. It's much cleaner now.

​**Q:** Speaking of excitement, there have been whispers of new material. Can you confirm you are **working on a new album**?

​**BS:** Yes, we are. And honestly, I think it’s going to be **New Order's best work**.

​The reason is \[bassist\] **Tom Chapman**. He’s brought a completely **new dimension** to our sound that simply wasn't there previously. He’s a fantastic musician and has injected a real freshness into our process. We’re working together differently, and it feels effortless and inspired. Tom’s influence has revitalized the whole thing, and I'm genuinely thrilled about what we're creating.

# ​On Finding the Voice and the Legacy

​**Q:** When you transitioned from guitarist in Joy Division to frontman and lyricist in New Order, how did you find your voice, both literally and figuratively?

​**BS:** It was sink or swim, wasn't it? I didn't want to be the frontman, but someone had to do it or the whole thing would fail. I’m a private person, and lyrics are literal—you're exposing yourself. So I’d sit with a bottle of wine, hours and hours, and just write until a couple of lines, a **stream of consciousness**, started to make sense. The trick is to **not care too much, but care just enough**.

​**Q:** The weight of Joy Division's legacy is something you've lived with for over four decades. Do you feel New Order ever truly ""cut the umbilical cord"" from that past?

​**BS:** I think we did with *Power, Corruption & Lies*. That album really made a positive statement that we were moving forward into our own electronic space. But you never completely escape it. And why should you? Those songs are part of my musical history, and I love playing them. People love them.

# ​The Future (and the Sea)

​**Q:** What’s next for Bernard Sumner?

​**BS:** I'm not a reflective person; I like the present. Everything’s good. We've got the new album to finish, and I truly believe in it. Outside of music, I'll be sailing. It's my refuge, a place where I stop being ""Bernard Sumner from New Order"" and I can just be myself, losing myself in the waves.

1pfka0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/1pfka0y/bakers_how_do_you_deal_with_missing_certain/,"Bakers, how do you deal with missing certain kitchen tools??","So this might sound ridiculous, but I genuinely thought I was losing my mind this past month. 😂  
I’ve been baking for over 15 years. Things like birthday cakes, holiday batches, sourdough phases, you name it. But lately… my measuring cups have been disappearing like socks in the dryer.

Every time I’d start a recipe there’d be ONE piece missing.  
Always the one I needed.  
Half cup? Gone.  
Tablespoon? Nowhere.  
1/3 cup? Might as well be a myth at this point.

At first I blamed my kids, then my husband, then the dishwasher… but nope. It’s just one of those recurring baker problems that makes you want to scream into a mixing bowl.

And it got me thinking:  
How do you all handle accurate measurements when half your tools magically disappear? Do you keep multiple sets? Use alternatives? Or am I the only one who deals with this nonsense on a weekly basis....? 

Anywayss, after the fifth time I had to pause a recipe to “estimate” a measurement (which never ends well…), I caved and tried something new. I found this digital measuring spoon, and honestly… I’m shocked I didn’t get one years ago.

It measures everything *exactly* in grams, from 30g to 500g, and I use it for literally everything now. I mean everything, things like flour, sugar, spices, oils, even coffee grounds. It completely solved my disappearing-measuring-cup crisis because I don’t NEED the whole set anymore.

It’s genuinely one of the best little baking tools I’ve bought in ages, and ridiculously affordable for what it does. If anyone else deals with runaway measuring cups (or you just like precision), this thing saved me",0,1765009502.0,Chefit,10,0.2,False

💡 I wasn't overspending on large items; rather, my peace of mind was being depleted by tiny, silent leaks. Similar to purchasing ""just one more"" coffee while commuting to work. Or, rather than making a plan, picking up quick groceries every two days. Or browsing, feeling anxious, and clicking ""add to cart"" for no apparent reason.

But here's the thing: I experienced clarity rather than guilt.  
It had nothing to do with limitations. It was about finally recognizing my patterns and viewing myself with compassion.  
  
I'm currently developing a gentle, shame-free system to help me manage my finances.  
One that supports me instead of breaking me.  
  
Has anyone else in this room ever attempted to keep track of every single expense?  
What caught you off guard the most?

1pfk88t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pfk88t,~1940s Vacheron & Constantin ref 4085 18K YG Curved Case or The Lost Spirit of Vintage Watch Collecting,"# ~1940 Vacheron & Constantin ref. 4085 or The Lost Spirit of Vintage Watch Collecting

*Comment written by user Raisin (see link in comments) and translated from Chinese language and readability improved by DeepSeek:* In today's watch collecting circles, truly exceptional vintage pieces are becoming increasingly rare. When one does occasionally surface, it tends to attract fervent attention and competitive bidding. What defines an ""exceptional piece""? On one hand, it refers to the inherent quality of the watch itself – outstanding condition, rarity, complexity of functions, or provenance linked to a notable figure. On the other hand, it is also shaped by the evaluation and endorsement from respected horological experts, amplified through online channels and media exposure.

While there is no shortage of fine timepieces, true connoisseurs are far less common. If we consider collectible watches as ""thoroughbreds,"" then the discerning collectors who recognise their value are the ones willing to pay a premium for them. Different eras produce different watches, and likewise, different eras cultivate different types of collectors.

I have always believed that the collectors of twenty or thirty years ago were driven by genuine passion. When they sought out vintage Vacheron Constantin pieces, their primary focus was on rarity, with little consideration given to future resale value. These individuals were true enthusiasts. Perhaps because the internet was still in its infancy and information was relatively scarce, encountering an unprecedented piece at auction would stir genuine excitement. These ""old-school"" collectors would even submit handwritten bidding forms in advance to the auction house or present them on the day. If successful, they would quietly appreciate their acquisition or share it within a small circle of friends, rarely leaving traces of public display online. Of course, many from this generation of collectors have since passed away, and the pieces they cherished may no longer be the focal point of today's market. With them, an era's aesthetic sensibilities and a lifetime of accumulated horological knowledge have quietly faded away.

In 1994 and 2005, Antiquorum held dedicated auctions for Vacheron Constantin. I still have the 1994 catalogue in my collection. The historical descriptions and the selection of lots reveal an ""academic"" approach by the experts of that time, which resonated deeply with the collectors of that era.

This V&C ref. 4085 is a relatively rare reference. Its exceptionally high hammer price at the time, I believe, can be attributed to several factors:

Firstly, Antiquorum's expertise was widely recognised as a mark of quality assurance. Their specialists accurately identified the reference (a competency often lacking among experts at major auction houses today, where references are frequently misstated or descriptions superficial) and, crucially, obtained archival extracts from the manufacture confirming: ""This watch was produced in April 1940 and sold on 10th July 1941 by Vacheron Constantin's New York boutique."" Such diligent research significantly enhanced the value of this uncommon reference. 

Secondly, the rarity of a black dial – regardless of its original state – holds an inherent allure, attracting considerable attention and funds.

Finally, the movement itself is noteworthy – the Calibre 203. This 9 ''' ligne movement entered use after 1939 and continued into the early 1940s, marking a brief period of production fitted to only a limited number of models. Prior to this, Vacheron Constantin had used the RA 9 ''' 94 calibre for approximately two decades. The K 203 was subsequently replaced by the Calibre 458 (which was later succeeded by the Calibre 1001). Dedicated brand auctions often command high premiums, and Antiquorum's scholarly approach, combined with the lot's inherent rarity, ignited the pure passion of collectors from that period.

Subsequently, in 1997, this same watch reappeared at Antiquorum. Its selling price had nearly halved, indicating a market correction towards rationality. Notably, the hands had been replaced. While sword hands are period-correct for the 1940s, the original would have been flat, faceted 'épée' style. The replacement with three-dimensional sword hands was somewhat incongruous.

Over the past decade, the global watch community, both domestically and internationally, has shifted from ""enthusiast collecting"" to something more akin to a business. The focus is on what's hottest, rarest, most expensive, experiencing the fastest price appreciation, or worn by celebrities. If you're not conversant with these trends, you can hardly claim to be part of the ""watch circle."" Social media platforms flooded with content on watch fairs, auctions, and purchasing experiences have greatly propelled the industry's growth but have also, to some extent, homogenised collecting tastes. A few swipes on a smartphone deliver a torrent of algorithmically-curated information, occupying one's mind without the need for personal discernment or comparison. Media channels effectively guide choices along predetermined paths – a shortcut better suited to today's fast-paced rhythm.

The case design of this Ref. 4085 is largely unappreciated and unaccepted by the majority in the current era. Thirty years ago, one could wear it for coffee or to a soirée. Today, pairing it with a suit would likely draw curious glances. The watch remains the same, but the times have changed, and so have the people who collect watches.

I am a collector of the new era, yet my heart belongs to the essence of the old. Seeing this piece listed again recently, its case shape immediately caught my eye. Although the dial is most likely a refinish, considering the historical context – post-1939, when Vacheron Constantin began its collaboration with Jaeger-LeCoultre – this watch exists precisely at that transition. A high-quality refinish, therefore, might be acceptable. If it housed a tonneau-shaped movement, the starting estimate could have been worth considering. However, the listing described the movement as 'K 202', which I suspected was an error, warranting further investigation.

The results of my online research thoroughly dampened my interest. This proved to be the very same watch discussed above, now subjected to a comprehensive refurbishment: the black dial replaced with a champagne colour, the hour markers changed – rendering it almost unrecognisable. With hundreds of lots in a single auction, it's understandable that catalogue compilers cannot conduct exhaustive research on every piece. However, incorrectly stating the calibre number is an avoidable error.

This watch has now appeared at auction three times, with its price successively halving on each occasion. This underscores two points: firstly, with vintage watches, originality is paramount – any modification can significantly impact value. Secondly, it simply no longer aligns with contemporary aesthetic preferences, making a high price unrealistic.

Writing this leads me to ponder: did those who refinished the dial ever examine a period-correct example or work from photographs of an original? Had the collectors of the previous generation been able to influence such restoration work, perhaps the result presented to us today would have been different.

The lobby of the Riverside County Police Department smelled of old paper, coffee, and something faintly metallic. The dim lights flickered slightly.

Officer Daniel Martinez was sitting at his desk. He was a young man, tallish and stocky, who was recently wanting—a massive amount of wanting—to be promoted to deputy sheriff. Being 25, and expecting a child soon, he should’ve been at home. With his wife. Especially at a quarter past 11 on a Sunday evening. But *no*, he had to work these extra hours.

That was the plan. Work enough hours to be promoted, then promoted again, promoted until he was deputy sheriff. Then be promoted to sheriff. Daniel pictured himself in the uniform, at the ceremony. Sheriff Martinez.

It had a ring to it.

He was reviewing this plan to keep himself awake, staring blankly at the screen in front of him and tapping his fingers on his desk to the rhythm of the song playing softly out of the speakers.

“Seven Nation Army couldn’t hold me back,” He hummed softly in sync with the music, his eyelids drooping, “they’re gonna rip it off…”

The sudden jingle of the door opening made him jump out of his skin.

A tall blonde man, in his early-to-mid 30s by the looks of it, crossed the lobby in 3 quick strides towards the front desk. Daniel stood up at once and rolled back his shoulders.

*Gotta look professional*, he thought, cracking his neck and leaning forward towards the man.

“Good evening,” Daniel said coolly, stifling a yawn, “Anything I could help you with?”

“Yes,” The man clipped back at once, “I was wondering if you could help me look for my kids?”

Daniel straightened his back and stared at the guy in front of him. A missing persons report? Why didn’t he call earlier? Had he, and Daniel didn’t notice? Could it have been that easy to file a report an hour ago and be that much closer to his goal?

No, the phone ringing would be too loud for Daniel not to notice.

If this *was* a missing persons case…

Would the department let Daniel help? Maybe this was how he would get promoted… He narrowed his eyes at the man, studying him. The man’s eyebrows were strung together, etched with worry. His gray eyes seemed to glow gold under the lighting, and it creeped Daniel out. The man was also wearing a suit. The type of classic black one that you take to the dry cleaners only to get it back red-colored. It was too crisp. Too formal. Did he get home from a business meeting and find his children missing?

*Focus*, Daniel told himself. He cleared his throat, forcing himself to make eye contact, “You reporting someone missing?”

The man shook his head, and chuckled lightly, “No, I don’t wanna file anything. My kids aren’t missing. They live with their mother, she has full custody—”

That was a red flag if Daniel had ever seen one. He nodded curtly and managed a strained smile, moving his gaze across the man’s shoulder, to the door.

“I haven’t seen them in a while, and they moved a little bit ago so I dunno where they are. I just wanted to stop by and— and say hi to them.” The man finished.

Daniel felt a surge of sympathy go through him. Then he met Man’s eyes.

He hesitated before replying. “Your name?”

“Robert Harvey.”

“Middle name?”

“Don’t have one.”

*Robert Harvey, arrested for child-napping 1 month from now*, at least Daniel was forewarned. He turned toward the screen, relaxing his posture a bit and leaning against the desk.

The only sound in that office for about half a minute was the clanking of the keyboard. As it turned out, they did have a file on him. Go figure. Daniel glanced at the clock on the wall, reading the time.

He felt a shiver go through him. Looked back at the man. His eyes…

“Robert Harvey, 33, ethnicity white, blonde hair and gray eyes?” Daniel asked, and the man nodded. Daniel continued listing his address, which the man confirmed, while checking his criminal history—which, surprisingly, the man had none but unpaid speeding tickets—silently. “Gotcha, okay… Um… Do you have the mother’s name?”

He glanced at the man again, forcing himself to meet those eyes. The man seemed to hesitate for a moment before saying, “Yeah, yeah… Angela Evans.”

More clanking of keys.

“There are 9 Angela Evans on file, sir,” Daniel said, trying not to laugh.

“The blonde one.”

“There are 3 blonde ones,” Daniel said, fighting hard to keep a straight face, “sir,” he added for good measure.

“*Harper* is her middle name, I think…”

*Robert Harvey, 33, arrested for the kidnapping of the children of Angela Evans, 36, 1 month from now*, echoed through Daniel’s mind as he opened her file. She was involved as a witness at the Coachella Valley Date Fair around 12 years ago. It was a weird incident. Daniel remembered going with his middle school friends and finding that they shut down the fair for the day.

Then a sudden realization hit him.

“Sorry, Mr. Harvey, for asking, but…” He paused and thought his words over carefully, “What exactly do you want?”

“Just show me the children and then I’ll tell you.”

Red flag number 2…

“Okay…” Daniel licked his lips over once, checking Angela’s file, “So the mother is Angela Harper Evans, 36, ethnicity white, blonde hair and brown—”

Harvey didn’t wait for Daniel to finish, “Yes, that’s her. She used to live in Palm Springs?”

Daniel blinked. “Yes, but—”

“What about her children?”

*Red flag!*, Daniel’s brain screamed, *Red flag!*

He shook the thought out of him and looked back towards the computer. She had 2 children. Quickly Daniel tried to see if they had any files on them, and they had a few school disciplinary records. He felt goosebumps on his arms.

A boy and a girl. Twins. Recently turned 11 the month earlier, December.

Most of the disciplinary incidents came from the boy.

He shouldn’t give him the names… He paused and glanced at the man.

The thought died as soon as it came.

“Blair Jane Evans and Bronwen Thomas Evans.” *Note to self: Angela’s naming skills are horrible*, “Nothing to see much, the girl has almost nothing on record, she was involved in something with the boy, though. The boy has a few… strange incidents—oh, I remember that one—both went to public school… 11, the both of them—”

“Twins?!” Harvey exclaimed.

“Yes.” Alarms burst through Daniel’s head.

*“Haven’t seen them in a while,” he says. But he didn’t even know he had twins, and: “Their mother has full custody,” Could it be that Harvey never met them, and he could be trying to take them forcefully from their mother? Is this man planning to kidnap his children?!*

He ignored the sirens. If he showed that he could handle this, he could climb his way up. He wouldn’t be the newbie anymore.

Martinez, Chief of Police…

Daniel tore his gaze from the computer and toward Harvey’s hands. The man was fiddling with something in an inside pocket. He dropped his arms to his side and exhaled through his nose, looking like he was trying to steady his breathing. Harvey ran a hand through his hair, and sighed deeply before speaking again, “Could I see their photos?”

Daniel nodded—couldn’t hurt showing him photos if he wasn’t going to give him the address anyway—and he flipped the computer screen to show Harvey the documented photo of the girl, Blair. It must’ve been taken recently, she looked about her age.

Daniel personally thought that she looked more like her mother than anything. With the brown eyes and blonde hair, she could’ve been anyone’s kid. The only thing about her that looked like Harvey was the blonde fact about her, and maybe their noses looked similar, but nothing else.

“And the boy?” Harvey asked, his voice shaking as if he was afraid of what he might look like, “What about the boy?”

*Robert Harvey, 33, arrested for the kidnapping of Bronwen Evans*, Daniel’s brain said loudly, *1 month from now.*

He clicked on the boy’s photo. This boy looked a lot more like the man in front of him, but not so much that you would think they were definitely related. The closest thing about him was his eyes, and again, his upturned nose and blonde hair.

Harvey’s eyes searched the boy’s face hungrily.

*Red flag.*

“That’s him…” Harvey muttered. Daniel thought he’d imagined the man saying it, but he didn’t, as he said, more loudly: “That’s the one I’m looking for.”

Daniel couldn’t help it, his mouth got ahead of his brain, “What about the girl—?”

“Her too.” The man said hastily, “Look… Could— Is there— Is there… Any way that you could give me their current address?”

Daniel made eye contact with Harvey. The hum of the AC quieted.

*No way you’re saying yes*, Daniel told himself, *If you do, you’re calling the psych ward to let you in yourself.*

“I’m sorry, sir,” Daniel said, trying to sound sincere instead of suspicious and turning the screen back around, “I’m afraid I can’t do that.”

The hum was back.

“Why not?!”

“Because requests like that require certain… How do I say this— *precautions*. Or— Or— Um… Somebody with more authority than I have, to complete them. It’s against protocol, to put it simply.”

Harvey looked at him in such a pleading way that Daniel felt pity for him. Why couldn’t he give him the address? What could this guy do, anyway?

*No.*

“Look, if you’re really serious about this request,” Daniel continued slyly, deleting the downloaded photos of the children, “I could ask Officer Delgado if I’m allowed to disclose that information to you…”

He turned around and placed his mug under the coffee machine, smirking slightly, “Of course, then you would have to come back *tomorrow* or next time I’m on shift here in the lobby, so I can call him, since he’s taking the night off today and probably asleep…”

He watched as the coffee mug filled, his arms crossed, chuckling lightly to himself.

*Caught in the act… Before the act even happened…*

Daniel opened the mini-fridge and took out a big jug of coffee creamer, opened a drawer, grabbed a spoon, and set them both on the counter. He waited, looking at the coffee machine to finish brewing his coffee.

His breath caught as something cold hit him square in the back. Daniel reached behind him to feel, but there was nothing to feel except the fabric of his shirt. He spun around to look at Harvey, who was stuffing something in his suit, and was overcome with a strange feeling. His brain fogged up, and he didn’t seem to think straight anymore. It was like someone had dimmed the lights in his head. Suddenly the world made sense in the wrong way.

Why *couldn’t* he give this man the children’s address? What would this man do anyway? Nothing bad, probably… He was just a guy who wanted to see his kids again.

Daniel could get that… He had a child on the way himself, just 4 months in the womb… A baby girl…

Dazed, and ignoring the beeping sound the coffee machine was currently making, he walked towards the computer, and scrolled down on Angela Evans’s file.

“Y’know what? Sure, I can give you the address…”

*What are you saying?!*

“Good,” Harvey gasped, “Good, good…”

And so he did.



The door slammed shut after the man left.

He’d copied down the address on a napkin with a pen that the officer let him borrow.

The station speakers started playing *Hayloft*.

Officer Martinez stared after Robert Harvey, blinking.

*Why did he do that?*

He quickly closed the tabs on the computer and slipped coffee creamer into his coffee. Stirring the mug, he glanced towards the lobby door again.

*His eyes glowed…*

Daniel put the spoon down and lifted the mug to his lips.

*No, eyes don’t glow…*

He should really get some sleep.

I'm currently looking into buying my first ""real"" espresso machine and grinder. Until now, I've been using a fully automatic coffee maker from DeLonghi.

I think I've already settled on what Grinder I want - I'm looking at the Varia VS3, but if someone knows a better option at around that price point I would be happy to hear it!

Now for the espresso machine - Currently I'm eyeing the MiiCoffee Apex V2 because I think it checks a lot of boxes for its price. I know that it comes from China though and sometimes has some issues with QC.

What are your recommendations for an espresso machine right around or under 500€? (\~580$)",1,1765008883.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
