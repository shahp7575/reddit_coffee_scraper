1q37ktg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1q37ktg/blessing_logic/,Blessing | Logic,"Why is it taught that in order to bless someone, you must be clean, worthy, righteous, male and a holder of priesthood? On my account, loving someone requires nothing more than love! Nothing but love!

Here is an example. While attending college, I frequently drove to my grandparent’s home to say hello, as they lived close by. My grandmother was mentally ill. She sat in her recliner in the living room of their home and rocked back and forth, scratching her fingernails with her fingernails, grinding them down, while she rocked back and forth, her mind being tormented for decades as she rocked back and forth, back and forth. Her husband was an angel. He took care of her 24/7/365. This is what love does. He was selfless. He sacrificed his life to take care of her. But, he drank coffee and smoked a pipe. He was also not Mormon, so he certainly could not be asked to give her a blessing. Well, she would ask me to give her a blessing. So, I would lay my hands on her head, while my grandpa sat there and watched me tell her that God loved her, that my grandpa loved her, that I loved her. It was awkward. It was uncomfortable. It was embarrassing. It was dark. It was unworthy. What is the opposite of truth? That! What is the opposite of light? That! What is the opposite of love? That! I will never forget it. Why? Because my grandpa was her blessing. But also because my grandpa should have laid his hands on her head. I deeply regret those times. But, I was still a child with lots and lots to learn about light, truth and love. I hope that one day I can ask for my grandpa’s forgiveness. I love him very much. He was a great example to me.

It has been my experience throughout my entire life, that God only comes when love is shown - and definitely not the other way around.

Blessing someone comes from love not because I am male, hold the priesthood, worthy or a member of the right religion.

1q37icn,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1q37icn/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1q37i9f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q37i9f,Lorann flavor fountain for simple syrup?,"Hi y'all!

I've been really interested in making flavored syrups at home (for coffee, but if I dare ask about flavoring coffee in the coffee subreddit, at least half of them will begin sharpening pitchforks). I looked up a copycat recipe for the butter pecan syrup dunkin uses and someone said to mix Lorann Flavor Fountain butter pecan flavoring with sweetened condensed milk. But that's not shelf stable; we'd rather have something we can keep above the coffee cart because fridge space is extremely limited. But, silly me, I bought the extract \*before\* learning that sweetened condensed milk is only shelf stable when unopened. So i thought about making a 2:1 simple syrup and flavoring it with the Lorann instead so it's not a waste. It's not labeled as an extract like vanilla though which is throwing me off, and the consistency is pretty thick almost like a syrup, but it says on the website that it's not a syrup. As a novice, I have no idea what to do with this information. I've seen plenty of people talk about using the essential oils but never the flavor fountain outside of making ice cream so I'm not sure where to go here.

  
Tl;dr- has anyone used the \*flavor fountain\* Lorann flavorings for simple syrup? If not, do you think I could?",1,1767477632.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False
1q37hrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lost-Manner5574/comments/1q37hrx/your_online_reputation_is_sabotaging_your_love/,Your Online Reputation Is Sabotaging Your Love Life (And How to Fix It),"Let's be honest: you've Googled every person you've ever considered dating. That cute person from the coffee shop? Googled. Your friend's friend who seems interesting? Googled. The match who actually responded on the dating app? Definitely Googled before agreeing to meet.

So here's the uncomfortable question: what happens when they Google you?

Your online reputation isn't just affecting your career prospects—it's directly impacting your dating life. While you're swiping right and crafting the perfect opener, potential matches are discovering your digital history. And sometimes, what they find is sending them running before you even get a chance.

The good news? You have more control over this than you think.

# The Modern Dating Background Check

Dating has always involved evaluation, but the internet has transformed it into something more thorough than most job applications. Before meeting for coffee, potential dates are conducting full digital investigations:

Your social media profiles reveal your lifestyle, friend group, political views, sense of humor, and how you spend your free time. Your tagged photos show what you look like in unfiltered reality and who you spend time with. Your old tweets and Facebook posts from years ago expose past opinions, jokes that didn't age well, and maybe some questionable decision-making. Your LinkedIn suggests your career trajectory and professional stability. Your presence (or absence) on platforms reveals generational and cultural markers.

Every Google result, every photo, every post contributes to the story someone constructs about who you are before ever meeting you. If that story includes red flags—real or perceived—you might never get the opportunity to tell your actual story.

# The Red Flags Killing Your Chances

Certain online reputation issues function as instant dating dealbreakers. Understanding what potential dates consider problematic helps you address issues before they sabotage connections.

**The Drama Magnet**: If your social media is filled with vague-posting about exes, complaining about dating, or airing relationship grievances publicly, you're broadcasting that dating you comes with guaranteed drama. Even if you've grown past this phase, those posts remain visible.

**The Party Animal**: Photos from every weekend showing you visibly intoxicated might have been fun at 22, but at 32, they suggest you haven't matured. One or two party photos are normal. Dozens create a pattern that makes people question your stability.

**The Angry Commenter**: Spending your online time arguing with strangers, posting inflammatory political opinions, or leaving aggressive comments suggests you're combative and exhausting. Even if you're passionate rather than angry, constant conflict online makes people think dating you means constant conflict offline.

**The Ghost**: Having zero online presence can be just as concerning as a problematic one. In 2026, complete digital absence makes people wonder what you're hiding or whether you're even real.

**The Oversharer**: Posting intimate details about past relationships, health issues, family drama, or personal struggles publicly demonstrates poor boundaries—a major relationship red flag.

**The Catfish Risk**: If your dating profile photos don't match what appears on your social media, people assume you're being deceptive. Consistency across platforms builds trust.

# The Strategic Cleanup: Making Yourself Dateable Online

Improving your online reputation for dating doesn't mean creating a fake persona. It means being intentional about what your digital presence communicates.

**Audit Your Social Media**: Spend an afternoon scrolling through your profiles as if you're a stranger evaluating dateability. Delete or hide posts that showcase bad judgment, excessive partying, relationship drama, or aggressive arguments. Untag yourself from unflattering photos. Remove posts that no longer represent who you are today.

**Update Your Privacy Settings**: Not everything needs to be public. Make personal posts visible only to friends. Keep your public-facing content to things that present you positively—interesting hobbies, achievements, travel, and genuine connections with others.

**Create Positive Content**: An empty or negative online presence is a missed opportunity. Post content that showcases your actual interests and personality: photos from hobbies and activities you enjoy, thoughtful perspectives on topics you care about, accomplishments you're proud of, and genuine interactions with friends and community.

**Google Yourself Regularly**: Set up Google alerts for your name to monitor what appears in search results. If negative content ranks highly, work to push it down by creating positive content on platforms like LinkedIn, Medium, or personal websites that will rank above old problematic material.

**Address the Elephant in the Room**: If something significant and negative exists online that you can't remove—maybe an old news article about a DUI or a business failure—consider addressing it proactively in your dating profile or early conversations. Owning past mistakes with evidence of growth is far more attractive than letting someone discover them and wonder why you hid it.

**Be Consistent Across Platforms**: Make sure your dating profile photos match your social media presence. Use recent photos that actually look like you. Inconsistency triggers suspicion even when you have nothing to hide.

# What Actually Attracts People Online

Creating an attractive online presence isn't about perfection—it's about authenticity combined with good judgment. The most appealing online reputations share common characteristics:

**Real But Curated**: Your life doesn't need to look perfect, but it should look functional. Post real moments that show you have friends, interests, and a life you enjoy—without oversharing problems or drama.

**Positive But Not Fake**: Excessive positivity feels inauthentic. It's fine to occasionally acknowledge challenges, but your overall tone should lean optimistic rather than complainy.

**Interesting But Accessible**: Share your genuine interests even if they're niche, but do it in ways that help others understand your enthusiasm. ""Spent six hours reorganizing my Magic: The Gathering collection"" might get more matches than you'd think if you explain why you find it satisfying.

**Connected But Not Desperate**: Photos with friends and at events show you're socially functional, but posting constantly or always seeking validation looks insecure. Quality over quantity.

**Grown But Growing**: Nobody expects you to have never made mistakes. Show evidence you've learned and evolved. The person who posted questionable things at 21 but now demonstrates maturity and better judgment is far more attractive than someone pretending they were always perfect.

# The Long Game: Building Sustainable Dating Reputation

Quick cleanup helps immediately, but building a strong online reputation for dating is an ongoing process. Think about the digital footprint you're creating today that potential matches will evaluate tomorrow.

Before posting anything, ask yourself: ""Would I want someone I'm trying to impress to see this?"" If the answer is no, don't post it publicly. Save those thoughts for private messages to close friends or just keep them to yourself.

When you do meet someone you're interested in, continue being mindful about what you post. Don't over-post about the relationship early on (it looks desperate and puts pressure on something new). Don't post anything negative if things don't work out (it guarantees your next match will worry they'll be subject to the same treatment).

# Your Digital First Impression Matters

We live in a world where your online reputation often determines whether someone gives you a chance in person. While it's unfortunate that people make snap judgments based on Google results and Instagram photos, pretending this reality doesn't exist won't help you find love.

Taking control of your digital presence isn't about creating a false image—it's about making sure the first impression someone gets online reflects the actual person they'd meet in real life. Clean up the mess from your past, present your genuine interests and personality thoughtfully, and give potential matches the accurate information they need to see you're worth getting to know.

Your perfect match might be out there right now, typing your name into Google. Make sure what they find makes them excited to meet you rather than relieved they discovered those red flags before coffee.

Dosed with liquor in my coffee,"Some background: I turned 24 today, I've quit drinking a little over a year ago, (sept 2024). I spent 4 years as an alcoholic and my life since 14 as a binge drinker, I'd typically drink 15-20 beers a day towards the end. I live with my grandparents, rent free and I'm unemployed, with some health issues from repeated concussions. Grandparents also don't drink much for health reasons but the rest of my friends and family are anywhere from moderate drinkers to severe alcoholics. I slipped up once 6 months ago where I had part of a beer but decided against it and poured it out. I've felt better mentally since quitting, less emotional and more of a calm and clear head. My social life has taken a hit though, introversion and anxiety have stopped me from getting out as much anymore. I did intend to correct that in 2026 though.

So getting to today, I woke up early this morning to start slow cooking a pork shoulder, grandparents were already up, grabbed my first cup of coffee from the fresh pot, went outside had a smoke and drank my coffee, nothing unusual. Came inside for my second cup of coffee, at first it tasted... sour, poured another cup and took another couple sips - alcohol, took another sip... tastes like Baileys. 

I proceeded to drink another 4 cups of coffee, as I like coffee and typically drink that much every day, caught a slight buzz at the end but figured I might as well continue and be absolutely sure it's alcohol. Buzz wasn't bad, nostalgic almost but I don't feel overwhelming cravings now so no real harm done, I know that I have the willpower and am not that concerned. Problem here is that I was dosed with alcohol without my knowledge or consent, I don't want that happening. One of my Grandparent's must've poured alcohol in after it brewed. I know the taste, I know the feeling, it's alcohol. 

I don't really know what to do now though, I feel that I can't confront them because I don't want to lose the good situation that I'm in, they've been extremely generous and I am grateful for that. I'm in one of the most expensive areas to live in Canada and would most likely wind up homeless if I blow up this situation. Not sure why they'd do it either? Make me lighten up and be more social for a stupid birthday? It's not for their own sake, as I drink most of the pot myself and they could've added some to their own cup after pouring it. 

Have to wonder if I'm really that miserable of a person they'd rather I was drinking again, even for a day, despite all of the support in getting me sober. Anyone else had a similar situation? ",4,1767477514.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

1q37exo,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1q37exo/blessing_logic/,Blessing | Logic,"Why is it taught that in order to bless someone, you must be clean, worthy, righteous, male and a holder of priesthood? On my account, loving someone requires nothing more than love! Nothing but love!

Here is an example. While attending college, I frequently drove to my grandparent’s home to say hello, as they lived close by. My grandmother was mentally ill. She sat in her recliner in the living room of their home and rocked back and forth, scratching her fingernails with her fingernails, grinding them down, while she rocked back and forth, her mind being tormented for decades as she rocked back and forth, back and forth. Her husband was an angel. He took care of her 24/7/365. This is what love does. He was selfless. He sacrificed his life to take care of her. But, he drank coffee and smoked a pipe. He was also not Mormon, so he certainly could not be asked to give her a blessing. Well, she would ask me to give her a blessing. So, I would lay my hands on her head, while my grandpa sat there and watched me tell her that God loved her, that my grandpa loved her, that I loved her. It was awkward. It was uncomfortable. It was embarrassing. It was dark. It was unworthy. What is the opposite of truth? That! What is the opposite of light? That! What is the opposite of love? That! I will never forget it. Why? Because my grandpa was her blessing. But also because my grandpa should have laid his hands on her head. I deeply regret those times. But, I was still a child with lots and lots to learn about light, truth and love. I hope that one day I can ask for my grandpa’s forgiveness. I love him very much. He was a great example to me.

It has been my experience throughout my entire life, that God only comes when love is shown - and definitely not the other way around. 

Blessing someone comes from love not because I am male, hold the priesthood, worthy or a member of the right religion.

1q37er6,https://www.reddit.com/r/babyloss/comments/1q37er6/pregnancy_loss_at_28_weeks/,Pregnancy Loss at 28 weeks,"WARNING- PREGNANCY LOSS

hello all, this is so hard for me to write but I need support and don’t know where to turn. my husband and I were so close to meeting our baby girl (Chloe Lynn) she was due March 25th of this year. last December I had went through a miscarriage. The pregnancy was there it just didn’t develop and there was no fetus/ heartbeat at my 9 week appointment. I miscarried at home. For this pregnancy I found out I was pregnant a day before we got married in July of this year. We were nervous but still excited. When you go through a loss it’s hard to not worry the next time around. We jumped the gun the last pregnancy and it was extremely difficult to turn around and tell people that things changed. As each appointment came up I got even more hopeful. We had the heartbeat this time, we did all the bloodwork possible and looked forward to the ultrasound visits. Baby Chloe was growing and all of her anatomy checks were perfect. There was nothing to worry about. My mom had the biggest baby fever as she was going to be a first time mimi. She went to thrift stores and fb marketplace helping us prepare and make sure we had everything we needed. I was feeling fine mentally and physically, the nursery was all finished and I would sit in there and admire all our hard work. It was finally time for me to take the dreaded glucose test. It wasn’t so bad. They also ordered other lab work to see my cbc levels and so on. A few days prior to the blood test I had thought I wasn’t feeling as much movement as I had recalled feeling before. But there was still movement. Mainly in the morning and after dinner time. I had reached out to the OB and let her know. They asked the usual questions. Any bleeding, cramping, unusual discharge, dizziness, headaches? Nope everything else was fine. I just didn’t know how to really monitor movement as a first time mom and everyone is different. I got the glucose results in the my chart app. I passed. The cbc results indicated that my iron was low and the next afternoon the doctor called to say I was anemic and needed to up my iron either by supplements or infusions. I’m not one for being hooked up to machines and with my job it would be hard for me to leave for over an hour twice a week for infusions visits. I asked the doctor what dose of iron I would need and they said the 65mg iron/ 325 ferrous sulfate would be fine and they could test again in 4 weeks. I asked what if my iron isn’t where it needs to be in 4 weeks? Will I have time to get the infusions if I need them? They assured me that would be okay and there really wasn’t a sense of urgency so I figured I would be alright. so I went to the grocery store and bought the supplements. Took one right away. I remember coming home from work and eating dinner and I’m sure I felt movement at that time. It wasn’t too much but I felt her. and the next morning I took my iron pill with a glass of orange juice. I was feeling my stomach looking for movement. I went to work. Had my morning coffee and bagel and had been feeling my stomach because I swore I wasn’t feeling movement but thought maybe it could be so slight that I didn’t feel it. But I just wasn’t happy with that. I ate a bunch of cookies and had cold water and walked around, did some jumping jacks, poked my belly, laid on my side. Pretty much anything you could think of doing to get her to move or react. I was worried to say the least. I messaged the OB and told her that I was worried and panicked because I haven’t felt anything and it had been at least 4 hours and I would really like to be checked. She told me to head to labor and delivery for an exam to make sure I was ok. I called my husband and explained what was going on so I drove home and then he drove us to the hospital. We went up to L&D and they put me in the triage room in a gown to check for the heartbeat. The first woman checked, she had trouble, she wasn’t finding it. Fear set in. My husband was clearly in distress. The next doctor came in to double check. The nurse held my hand as they looked at the machine shaking their heads. Silence. The last thing I wanted to hear was silence. They asked if it was okay to tell me what they were seeing. I instantly knew my world was ending. Every hope and dream I had for my baby girl and I had flashed before me. I screamed. I cried. My husband embraced me and what came next was me apologizing. I felt then that somehow this was my fault. After that was a series of decisions. Impossible decisions I won’t ever wish on anyone to make. Labor options included being induced, c section, or general anesthesia c section, and D&E. We wanted answers. We wanted my safety. More than that we wanted this to not be real and for the doctors to be wrong. I opted for the c section where I would not be awake or aware. We did it that night and by midnight I was in my hospital room recovering. My husband stayed overnight with me and we cried. I didn’t know if I wanted to see her. I was so scared. I asked the nurse taking care of me how my baby girl looked. She said she looked perfect, just tiny. I decided I did want to see her and know what she looked like and hold her and give her all the loving that I had. My husband went to the next room with the nurse to bring her to me. She was absolutely perfect. She had his little button nose, my cheeks and lips, and under her little crochet hat was a head of dark hair. So different than what I had pictured but exactly how she looked in her ultrasound picture. Nonetheless she was a perfect angel. So innocent, so small, so wanted. I wanted to take her place. I would give anything to have heard her cry, see her eyes open, and take her home with me. I opted for them to send my placenta and umbilical cord and to do an autopsy. I just wanted answers to what went wrong. I can’t help feeling like I did something wrong, that if I had done something sooner or knew about my iron that things could be different, that somehow I could have prevented this. I am filled with grief and sadness and guilt and I want so bad to know that I’m not alone and to have someone to talk to that has been in my shoes and can relate to what I’ve gone through.

1q37e70,https://i.redd.it/xapk6x7mh7bg1.png,Sparkling Clarified Last Word,"I recently clarified a batch of Last Word and today I decided to try it carbonated. The result was very tasty - the bubbles elevated the drink and made it more physically appealing. Clarifying the drink gave it a velvety mouthfulfeel and toned down the tannins in the alcohol, making it very smooth. 

Why did I do this? You may ask. Because I could. That's the answer. The Last Word is a perfectly great cocktail on its own, so while clarifying it and giving it bubbles does maybe make it more elegant, it's probably not worth the effort. But I had to satisfy my curiosity and the scientist in me with this experiment.

The recipe:

First, make the cocktail:

Equal parts (4 ounces) each: lemon juice, gin, Maraschino liqueur, and green Chartreuse.

Put half the ingredients into a cocktail mixer with ice and shake for 20 seconds. Then double strain into a container and repeat with the other half of the ingredients. 

Clarify:

On a separate container place 4 ounces of whole milk. Then slowly pour the cocktail mix while gently stirring to promote curdling. Once all the ingredients are mixed in, place the container in the fridge overnight. The next morning, strain the mix over a coffee filter. Then repeat again for a second time. Then, bottle your clarified cocktail.

Make it Bubbly:

Add 3 ounces of the clarified cocktail to a bottle of your sparkling drink maker (I used Drinkmate Omnifizz), place into your sparkling water maker, press the buttons until bubbly. 

Serve on a flute with a lemon peel (expressing the lemon oils).

All of these candles had long been collecting on my wishlist, hence the mish-mash in variety. And alas, they all went on sale around BF. Sellers are extending those dang discount days longer and longer, so I doubt I could have acquired this many if limited to one, frenzied Friday of the year. I figure I would’ve eventually bought them all anyway and it’s so much fun when they come as a haaaaaul!

Roughly L to R, standouts on the second slide: 

**- P.F. Candle Co. Cathedral Clove, Smoked Cherry** \- No throw whatsoever on the former. Didn’t care for the odd scent of the latter. Not sure what they were going for there? I get burning pile of thrift store clothes.

**- Trudon Nazareth** \- Nothing special. I found it relatively generic compared to their holiday editions from season’s past. I want to be upset but just can't get mad at that vessel.

**- Boy Smells So Vanilla, Minty, Vanilla Era, Salted Carmel, Starry Spice** \- Do not care for most of these but I had to try them! Not that they’re awful, I just have others that are better with similar notes. Okay fine, fine...So Vanilla is awful.

**- Aqua di Parma Nocciola** \- Incredibly strong throw and a dead ringer for those hazelnut chocolate balls in the gold foil. 

**- Kismet Nostalgia** \- Winner! Highly recommend. Definitely leather forward but not acerbic. I think the tonka takes the edge off without diluting. I would rebuy!

**- Nopalera Chocolate Ibarra** \- Weak throw without the complexity I’d anticipated given the listed notes. The terracotta vessel is nice for a change though. It’ll be great to use as a paired burn to give it some depth.

**- Malin + Goetz Dark Rum** \- Scratched the itch to smell the hype on this cult classic and I like it well enough. It’s different than something I would generally reach for so I’m happy to have it on hand for those kinda days.

**- Harlem Candle Co. Speakeasy, Brownstone Spice, The Renaissance** \- Speakeasy’s a rebuy and the other two are absolutely the quality I’ve come to expect from HCC. Highly rec Brownstone Spice especially. I can pick out all of the listed notes, and yet they blend together in this harmonious way that I find to be unique amongst seasonal candles that only wish they would smell this pretty.

**- Apothia Icon** \- Lame sauce. No throw and the light whiffs I summoned smelled nothing like the listed notes. Bummer, because roasted espresso/aged Florentine leather/tarocco blood orange sounded so unique.

**- Agraria Bitter Orange** \- Yep, a 100% on the nose *very* bitter orange. Thrilled to finally have this one since it’s also somewhat of an old-school classic and it did not disappoint!

**- Linnea Gather** \- My first Linnea and won’t be my last as the quality was solid. It’s a spice candle for sure, but I get some herb-y action too. Maybe Thyme? It stops short of being savory though, which I appreciate. 

**- The Maker Café** \- I know this one is rec’d here often and I’d wanted it forever since I love coffee as a note. However, I felt like this was such a basic bitch of a scent. NO shade to the BBW crew amongst us I swear, but if I didn’t know any better I’d think it was straight from my sad-yet-still-standing local mall.

**- Lafco Absinthe Plum & Spiced Pomander** \- I was hoping for more absinthe in the former, but hubs likes it (which is practically a national holiday if he comments on a candle). Spiced Pomander is a rebuy that I keep as a holiday standby to rotate between burns of the Boy Smells Incensorial I continue to milk.

**- Calyan Wax Co.** \- Not lux or even mid lux so I didn't include it in my first pic, but I'm telling you this candle slaps. It's not expensive, so they're really a deal when on sale. My ~~Whore~~ Whole Foods stocks it, so if you're a customer there I suggest making a point to give it a sniff.

**- Heretic Weeping Bust** \- Ah, the pièce de résistance. I had lost hope I’d ever get the ivory wax edition and then, and THEN, *on sale*! She is a goddess (corgi for scale reference), and I am thinking I’d like to MacGyver a way to set some black or red wax tea lights inside her head so she cries in color. ❤️🖤

I made it clear I was looking for something serious, and we hit it off immediately, went on constant dates, texted all the time, etc. It's the first time I've ever dated a guy, which is why I'm not sure if I was wrong about this situation. He has a friend, “Peter” (22m) he met in uni two years ago(we don't attend the same uni), whom he talks about all the time. Not in a suspicious way, just very frequently. I never met him, but from the things he'd tell me, I suspected this friend might have a thing for him. ex. invited him over multiple times because my bf has a long commuting time, bought him random stuff he mentioned he wanted (not big gifts, mostly coffee and pastries, and one time a cigarette case)... but every time I hinted at this, my boyfriend shut me off and told me just because he was into guys, I didn't need to worry about every guy he talked to. 



I tried not to think about it, but one day he didn’t answer me for like four hours. When he did, he was vague, distant, until I found out he’d spent the afternoon at Peter’s smoking weed and came home only after dinner. It pissed me off not only because he was cagey and ignored me, but also because he knows I hate that he smokes and had promised me he didn’t anymore. We had a small fight: he told me I was being too possessive, that Peter was supposed to go back home for break, so they wanted to spend time together before he left, and that I have no business policing how much time he spends with his friends anyway. I kind of agree on that, but when he’s with other friends, he usually texts me back and lets me know. Anyway, I apologised, and for a few days things went back to normal. We decided we’d spend the weekend after Christmas together at my place and I planned things I knew he really liked, made reservations for dinner at one of his favourite places, just for him to text me like an hour before to tell me he didn’t know if he could come. Why?



Turns out Peter didn’t go back home because he got a really high fever and couldn’t make it to the flight, so he spent the holidays sick at his apartment. My boyfriend found out only that day and his first thought was to cancel our plans to check on him. 

At that point, I recognize I might have fucked up by blowing up at him, but it sounded crazy to me; he knows I’m nervous about Peter and never once took my worries seriously, never tells me when they’re hanging out and when he mentions it he’s always vague about what they do, and now he was ditching out pre-planned date because he gave him a call. He got mad and asked me how I’d feel if I was very sick and alone on Christmas and had no one to take care of me, and started calling me controlling and shit, which only made me madder. I asked if Peter didn’t have anyone else he knew to check on him and he didn’t answer. I told him that if he had taken care of himself for the past week he could do so for the weekend too, and he told me I was being an asshole. It honestly felt like he wasn’t even sorry for ruining our date, so I told him that if that guy mattered so much he chose him over us, he should commit to him and not me. He told me to go fuck myself and I haven’t heard from him since then (it’s been less than a week). If you think I’m an asshole please tell me: I know I might have been too harsh and I regret it, but I also think he should’ve been more mindful of my feelings in this whole deal.

# Coming in 2026

**Clarifying our messaging**

Over the past year, the community has made one thing clear: our rules and guidelines can be difficult to understand. We hear you. In response, we’ve been working on a restructured version of our rules that is clearer, easier to navigate, and better highlights what matters most without burying important details.

Alongside this, we’ll be updating our macros, including removal reasons and modmail responses, to better explain our rules, expectations, and moderation actions.

**Improved automation and tooling**

We’ve also been bringing the subreddit up to date with Reddit’s newer tools and features. You may have already noticed some changes, including new Devvit apps in the sidebar, reminders while posting or commenting, automatic modmail responses, and expanded flair options.

Behind the scenes, we’ve strengthened our automod to catch significantly more instances of incivility, trolling, and hate, while avoiding unnecessary interference with normal participation. As Reddit continues to roll out additional tooling and AI driven features in the new year, we’ll be integrating them thoughtfully for both moderation efficiency and community experience.

**Better moderation**

The r/Canada mod team remains committed to providing a consistent and high quality experience for the community. This means continuing to refine internal processes, listening to feedback, and working with users to improve how moderation is applied and communicated.

**Expanding the team**

And finally, new mods! We’ll be expanding the r/Canada mod team in 2026.

We’re currently working through what we need, what roles we’re looking to fill, and how to best support new moderators once they’re on board. We’re also mindful of how important this process is, and we’ll be approaching moderator selection with care.

When we’re ready, moderator applications will go live right here on the subreddit.

# A few words from our mods

**What did 2025 look like for you?**

**SirJohnAMcMuffin:** 2025 was a challenging year which forced me to do some self-reflection and pursue some selfcare. I've looked to take some time each day to meditate and be more mindful. It sounds cheesey, but have found it to be helpful to take a break in a day and just calm my mind. It's led to better sleep overall and I plan to continue. I have also aimed to develop a stronger work-life balance while giving me time to also explore moderation.

**Evilbred:** Spent too much time on Reddit.

**vARROWHEAD:** I did more fishing and scuba diving, and got back into snowboarding after many years.  Also developed healthier habits and started going to the gym regularly.

**BvbblegvmBitch:** 2025 was a trying year. I started it with strong aspirations and a clear plan for success. Grief flipped those plans upside down, and I found myself scrambling to keep up with the challenges life threw at me. Thankfully, those challenges also came with unexpected successes, and I can happily say I’m heading into 2026 in a much better place than where I started in 2025. I’m surrounded by loved ones, in a new tax bracket, and in a healthier headspace going into the new year. On a lighter note, I also got a new paddleboard.

**DanSheps:** Enjoyed the summer with my wife and kids.

**House\_of\_Suns:** Travelled in Canada to the Rocky Mountains, Travelled to the East Coast.

**Voteoutofspite:** Moderation-wise, election years are always hectic. Offline, have been working hard and finding more time to go outdoors. 

---

**What are your plans for 2026?**

**SirJohnAMcMuffin:** For this next year, I'm hopeful to find some success gardening. I always start trying with seeds too late and I always find myself behind and miss the growing season. I'd like to try growing a few cucumbers, tomatoes, potatoes in my modest garden. Maybe some herbs in a DIY hydroponic tower?   

I also want to try to get into some interesting podcasts, but struggle to find ones of quality and interest. I want to like podcasts but I've not yet found that content and style that resonates with me. I'm always open to trying out and listening to new Canadian content creators. 
  
On a moderation front, I would really like to explore ways to enrich and diversify the content on the subreddit.While news and politics dominates the user generated content, I would love to see more of people's experiences in this vast and diverse country of ours and seek out ways for more positive (and less opinion based) content.

**Evilbred:** Launch r/OnTheClaphamOmnibus, a subreddit for discussion of various current events, as a forum where people from different opinions and viewpoints can express those as reasonable people.

This would be a coffee-house or pub setting, with a willingness to broach the more controversial, with a reasonable level of tact. 

I also recently bought a house, and will be suburbanizing from my current downtown yuppie lifestyle.

**vARROWHEAD:** Determine what my career path should be and make more time for things I want to do.

**BvbblegvmBitch:** I’m hoping to get back in the saddle this year. I’d planned to last year, but between my career and a lot of unexpected travel, I never quite found the time. I’m itching to race some barrels. How fast could they be?

I’ll also be back at Shambs this year, and I’m betting I’ll see some of you there. ~~Please help me put my tent up, I cannot be trusted with poles.~~

**DanSheps:** Going to Japan to visit family with the wife and kids.

**House\_of\_Suns:** More travel within our amazing country.

**Voteoutofspite:** Keep growing and building as best I can.  Try to complete my goal of having visited every province and territory.

---

**What is your New Year’s resolution?**

**SirJohnAMcMuffin:** Read more? My personal reading list is growing too fast, and finding the time to pursue recreational reading is always a challenge for me. So hopefully I can at least maintain a steady pace.

**Evilbred:** Start running once again in earnest, ideally getting my pace back below 5:30/km.

**vARROWHEAD:** Set a budget each month and review it.

**BvbblegvmBitch:** Last year, my New Year’s resolution was to stop buying consumable products I already had sitting around unused. That meant no more candles, homemade soaps (sorry farmers’ markets), or lip balms. I was mostly successful, with the exception of a few lip products. 

This year, I want to apply that mindset to my closet. I’m hoping to move away from synthetic fabrics and trend driven pieces and focus more on well made, sustainable and ethical natural fiber basics that will last me decades. No more itchy, pilling, threadbare polyester. If it won’t last until I’m in the ground, I don’t want it. 

**DanSheps:** Lose \~10kg

**House\_of\_Suns:** To watch more Blue Jays games and will them to sign Bo Bichette and win the World Series in 2026.

**ManOfManyTalentz:** My new year's resolution is to continue supporting r/guardtheleaf and r/buycanadian, and keep praying for r/stadia to return.  

**Voteoutofspite:** Got a big one, but I can't share it here. 

---
  
**Final Words**

**SirJohnAMcMuffin:** I remain constantly amazed by the pace of content that gets flagged for moderation, whether it's users reporting content or auto-moderation filters. It's continually shocking (it's not shocking, more disappointing) to see how some folks talk to each other.I suspect many people have forgotten when their parents' said ""if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.""  I think that's something many of us could improve on- bettering how we interact with others. 

**Evilbred:** Please just be kind to each other. Remember, everyone from the burger flipper, to the welder, to the police officer, to the doctor are all working class. If you earn money from labour, you are working class. We need to remember that our country exists for the benefit of Canadian citizens, not businesses, not the political elite, and not foreign nationals or powers. We, the Canadian citizenry, need to be more engaged, and focused on what affects us, benefits us, and our ability to raise our families.

**vARROWHEAD:** I genuinely appreciate our moderation team for its willingness to work together and openness to conflict resolution and diversity of opinions.

**ManOfManyTalentz:** We will continue to be an anti-hate place but the struggle is real, as some would try to divide us. I'm always shocked at the level of professionals and professionalism found in this mod team, but please know that in 2026 we'll continue doing as much janitorial cleanup with the ultimate goal of honest discussions, not fake astroturf.

Bots now with AI will continue to be a problem from here on out - you don't have to hear it from us. if you feel you are made of better and sterner stuff than most, please reach out when the mod call appears!

Shoutout to Caroline Orr Bueno, PhD!

**Voteoutofspite:** I appreciate the userbase here, because the vast majority of you are having interesting discussions and being very reasonable. There's always challenges with a subreddit of this size, but we're going to continue to do our best to preserve this as a place where people can discuss things reasonably, including disagreements.

1q37a0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1q37a0e/adhd_commorbid_with_bipolar_i_laced_with/,Adhd commorbid with bipolar I laced with substance abuse. Opinions,"So for ADHD anphetamines have been studied and used as medication. Why has cocaine never been studied or used as basis for medicine? First time I took it was the first time I could focus. Like really focus. I am usually in a daze all day. I can't use anphetamines like ritalin or adderall because I have general and social anxiety due to commorbid bipolar and it makes it worse. I am on trazodone right now and I am better but it gives a little drowsiness. Maximum dosage I am at 30% capacity in terms of focus and attention. I am no longer worried and anxious about driving or making a horrid mistake at work. But I would like at least for a day in my lifetime to be able to spend a month, even just a month, focused and motivated as I used to be on cocaine but without the addictive and unstable properties. Has it been studied and led nowhere? Or has it never been studied? My adhd is so bad I once started wandering in my mind while driving and forgot I was driving. When I 'woke up' it was too late to avoid crashing the car. Luckily only material damage, but all my life I am so scared of doing daily things. When I developed bipolar due to the cocaine abuse, they started me on abilify and lithium. It made it so much worse I went shopping and I had to take a picture of where I left my car or else I'd forget it even if it was a familiar place. The damage to my brain from all the drug abuse is hopefully not permanent. It's been 6 years since the major abuse and from my last relapse everything seems to be going smoother just some memory problems and sometimes when I get too nervous or anxious it breaks my line of thought completely. But I feel I have a chance. What I don't think is right is me being unmedicated most of my life because even though there's no consensus regarding ritalin, adderal, etc. being the best medication, it seems there are no further developments for ages. My parents did not agree for me to be medicated with this. And it's harder to diagnose in women since it's usually more mental and less physical hyperactivity. It's been hell to explain to my doctors that there is an underlaying condition that makes all the bipolar symptoms worse. Like I am not thinking fast because I am maniac. I am always thinking fast. And when I am depressed it's worse. I keep calling myself all kinds of hurtful and bad things on repeat until it makes me wanna die. When I am maniac it accelerates to a point where I just blurt out words or sentences that don't even have a connection because the thoughts are so fast I can't grasp them. In the past I've resorted to drugs because... A long hit of cocaine and I stop thinking. I don't take it to become social or inflate my self esteem, I take it to fall back on the couch with a smile on my face, finally with silence in my head. And when the thoughts come on cocaine they come slow and steady in the beginning. Then cause it's so addictive it just stops giving that effect. There is not a single medication in psychiatry that does this. The closest that does it for me are some anti depressants. I used to take clomipramine to stop mania. The sleepiness and drowsiness side effects in the first weeks were enough to stabilize me. I took it for two months or three and I was OK. Now I have trazodone. It numbens the right amount on my brain. I cannot do treatment alone for bipolar I because of the dopamine imbalancement. I was put on abilify and sodium valproate for a couple of years and I worked and slept. All my time was spent in bed thinking the worst things about me and calling myself names. I didn't move for weekends on end. I didn't leave the house. I was depressed for three years, severely, on treatment for bipolar I. It was so scary for me when I relapsed and had to undergo treatment again because I never want to feel like this again. It's inhuman to do this to another human being. I complained for months. For my doctor at the time to tell me I was not depressed because I didn't cry. I have also emotional problems. For me to cry I would have to literally be dying or someone close. My depression is gray and silent but it absolutely crushes me. I asked to change doctors and asked for multi chemical therapy this time. Is this a crazy idea of a mentally ill person, are my cravings getting so bad I am trying to make cocaine good in my mind or does this make any sense? Also, my mania was from going cold turkey from 3gr of coke a day for 2 months and second time 5 days of mdma, ecstasy, cocaine and other party drugs all mixed with no sleep. I am not ""takes an extra coffee and flips"" bipolar. I am ""I was just trying to make the numb inside me to leave and I made a mistake"" bipolar. ",1,1767477067.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

1q379bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q379bh/time_flies/,Time Flies,"The completed time machine sat before my eyes. It had taken decades of research and the last of my now measly savings to get this far, but my work had finally paid off. I had been ostracized from the scientific community, my papers rejected, accused of falsifying data, but it had all been worth it. I would be the first human to travel through time—that is, if “first” actually meant anything when it came to temporal mechanics. The outer boundary of science would expand further than ever before, all thanks to my persistence.

Or at least, that’s what I had been telling myself for the past two weeks. Every day, I would come down to my jury-rigged basement laboratory and simply stare at the machine I had built. I had double and triple-checked every calculation, tightened every last screw, and yet I still felt a sense of unease. I had even sent various objects back in time to test for any lingering effects of time travel; there were none, though whenever I got a cup of coffee from my future self it always ended up cold. But despite all the preparations, I was still unable to step into the machine myself.

I took a sip from the very same coffee cup as I gazed on at my creation. It was freshly made—I must not have decided to do any experiments tomorrow, as I hadn’t received anything from the future yet. A fruit fly buzzed around my face, and I swatted it out of the way in annoyance. Why didn’t I have the courage to test the machine myself? Had Chuck Yeager hesitated before he set out to fly faster than sound, or Neil Armstrong before he first stood on the moon? I had to do this, for my own sake as much as for the sake of humanity. I had devoted my life to breaking the temporal barrier. I had to see it through.

But then, the same doubts began to creep back into the edges of my mind. I had gone over the calculations again and again, but what if I had made a mistake? Every last part of the machine functioned perfectly, but what if something broke? What if traveling through time killed me, or worse, permanently trapped me in a sub-temporal state? What if I inadvertently created a paradox and caused the end of all reality? My research had shown me such a thing was fundamentally impossible, but what if I was wrong? Was it worth taking the risk, no matter how small, if the consequences could end the universe? 

I had to step inside the time machine… but there was no rush. I could always do it tomorrow. After all, what does one more day matter when it comes to time travel? I had told myself that yesterday, and the day before, but tomorrow would be different. For now, I would just go over everything one last time, make sure it all works. If tomorrow was the big day, the pressure would be off me for today.

At that moment, a sudden flash of bright light shone out from the far wall, combined with the now-familiar *vorp* of spacetime reasserting itself that I had heard in all my experiments. My eyes shot over to the opposite end of the laboratory. Had my future self decided to do another test? I always sent objects back to 10:00 on the dot, but it was already a quarter past. My heart jumped. Something had to be different. I waited with bated breath as the localized blurriness caused by time travel slowly faded.

After a moment, it became clear what the object was. It was my time machine, albeit a much older version of it. It looked to be in complete disrepair, as if it had been abandoned for decades. Small fractures spread across the hull of the pod, covered in grime and degrading paint. Before I had a chance to fully comprehend what I was seeing, the door of the machine creaked open, and I got a good look at its inhabitant.

My coffee cup fell out of my hands, shattering on the concrete floor, but I was too shocked to notice. There, collapsed inside the machine, was me—or rather, me as I might have been fifty years in the future. My hair was white and wispy, my skin cracked and wrinkled, and I seemed to have gotten a few inches shorter. I had received objects from the future with no warning, but seeing my own future self there in front of me left my mind completely blank. I simply stood there, too stunned to do anything or comprehend the implications of the situation.

After a couple seconds, I saw my future self’s eyes glance up at me. Age would clearly hit me hard; I seemed to be nearly on death’s door, unable to even stand. I nervously walked towards the time machine, crouching down in front of the door. The air wafting from inside was stale and dusty, with the faint smell of mold permeating the room. The temperature in the laboratory seemed to drop noticeably.

Suddenly, a hand shot up, grabbing hold of my lapel and pulling me down with a firm yet tired grip. Before I knew what happened, I was making direct eye contact with my future self. They were dull, unfocused, as though I was nearly blind, and yet I saw something else in them as well. It was a sense of desperation, of hope, as if this one moment was all I had left to live for. My future self’s mouth opened, and two faint, strained words escaped:

*“Time… flies….”*

And with that, the grip loosened. I saw the life leave my own eyes, and yet my mind was elsewhere. I had no concern for witnessing my own death—if anything, it was a relief to know I would live to an old age—and yet the mystery of the phrase called to me. “Time flies?” What could that possibly mean? What could be so important about those two words that I would spend my last moments delivering that one message to my past self?

 A sudden realization hit me. Time flies. What if I had spent every single day telling myself that I would make my first temporal flight tomorrow, but I had never gone through with it? Could I have not realized where the time had gone until I was on my deathbed, and only then found the courage to step into the machine? The idea terrified me. I simply kneeled there, unable to move, unable to think in the face of the existential dread that the knowledge of my own hopeless future had brought me.

But then, I realized there was still a gleam of hope. My future self had come here to give me a second chance. None of my work had shown that the future was immutable; perhaps it could be modified. If the knowledge of my future could spur me on to change my actions, maybe this fate could be avoided. I couldn’t let time slip away from me the way my future self had. It took every last shred of willpower I had, but I rose to my feet and stumbled into the present-day machine. 

The door swung shut as I primed the startup sequence. Every system roared to life smoothly, and I saw the faint shimmer of the temporal shielding flicker over the porthole. I punched in the destination to the terminal—the abandoned warehouse across the street, fifteen years in the past. I had scouted it out as the location for my first flight all that time ago, since it was a large, empty location with no risk of running into a person, at least at the time I had chosen. I only wished I had stayed at the time, to find out if my flight would be successful, but I was still concerned about possible paradoxes back then.

My heart pounded faster than it ever had before. Everything was working perfectly, but how long would that keep up for? I had installed countless safety features, even an abort button to send me back to my starting time in an emergency, and yet they could all still fail. But as much as I wanted to put it off yet another day, I had already made my decision. I had to go through with this, no matter how scared I was. My hand hovered above the “Confirm” button, ready to launch. I swallowed, closed my eyes, and pressed down.

There was a slight rumble, and I heard the *vorp* of the machine separating from the primary timeline, followed by a smooth hum. My eyes nervously flickered open. Every reading on the terminal was coming up nominal; the time machine had worked without a hitch. I glanced over at the porthole, my heart racing. Just as I had expected, the view was pure black save for the shimmering shielding: external light could not interact with the machine in this state. I had done it! I had become the first human to travel backwards in time! The fear I had felt earlier simply melted into the ether, now nothing but a relic of the past—or rather, the future.

A tiny fruit fly buzzed past my head. It must have been sitting in the time machine when I entered and inadvertently gotten trapped on a temporal voyage, the same way it might hitch a ride cross country on a car. How little it must understand of its situation, I thought as I sat down in my chair. When the door opened once again, it would be not just in a different place, but a different time. Would it even be able to recognize such a change, to understand the concept of past and future? No doubt it would simply return to its life of buzzing around, ignorant of the fact that it was the first fly to ever travel through time. A blissful existence for a fly, I supposed.

I leaned back in my chair, a wave of tiredness washing over me. It had been morning when I left, but the stress and excitement had taken a lot out of me. I glanced over at the monitor. For a journey of ten years, traveling at this speed through extra-dimensional space, it would take about twelve minutes of local time to reach my destination. I focused on the countdown timer, listening to the smooth hum of the machine. I had already traveled back almost a year; no doubt the next nine would follow just as smoothly.

Suddenly, something caught my eye on the corner of the screen. My stomach jolted. It was an error alert—a minor one, far from triggering any emergency sequences, but an error nonetheless. My fear quickly returning, I clicked on it to open the machine diagram. It was a tiny fracture in the temporal shielding, no more than a couple millimeters large. It wasn’t big enough to cause any meaningful exposure to exterior space—perhaps the hull near it might be a bit more worn—but it terrified me regardless. What had caused it? Had I hit some kind of temporal debris, or was the pressure of such a large craft putting excess strain on the shield generator? I had to keep watch on it for the rest of the flight, to make sure it wouldn’t spread. If the temporal shielding failed, I would be exposed to the full brunt of extra-dimensional space with nothing to protect me but simple airtight steel. I wasn’t quite sure what effects such a thing would have on a living being, and I had no interest in finding out.

The fruit fly shot past my head again and I waved it out of the way, keeping my focus on the display. However, a second one buzzing past caused me to shift my attention. Two flies? Sure enough, as I looked around the cabin, I saw two different flies hovering around. One fly getting stuck in the time machine was believable, but two didn’t seem right. The machine was relatively sterile. There shouldn’t have been any reason for multiple flies to be here. I was probably overthinking it, but something just didn’t sit right with me.

I glanced back at the display. There wasn’t just one hole in the shielding; there was a second one I had missed as well. I froze. It seemed completely inconceivable, but could the flies be related to what was happening? Before my very eyes, a third microfracture appeared on the shield. I looked around once more, and sure enough, three different fruit flies were buzzing around the cabin. I could feel a sense of panic welling up, but the adrenaline of the situation kept it in check for now. I had to investigate.

I slowly brought my hands up to one of the unaware flies and swatted it in midair, a strange cold feeling overtaking the part where it touched my skin. For whatever reason, the action made my arms feel fatigued. Had I really gotten that tired? Regardless, I had more important things to focus on. I felt my heart pound as I slowly unclasped my hands to get a good look at the fruit fly I had just killed.

It wasn’t a fruit fly.

It vaguely resembled the shape of a common fly, and yet it was completely otherworldly. Its body was composed of pure black shards reminiscent of volcanic glass, shattered into pieces by the force of the impact. Its wings shone a rainbow of hues as if they were pure energy, still pulsating and shimmering, vibrating in a humming sound that sounded near identical to the wings of a fly. It was clearly dead, and yet, as I watched dumbfounded, the shattered crystals began to restructure themselves as if the concept of entropy itself had been reversed. After just a moment, it took off from my palm, resurrected and returned to its course around the room. 

I suddenly understood. It must be some kind of living being, native to extra-dimensional space. No wonder it had breached the shielding; I hadn’t even considered this as a possibility when designing it. A rush of excitement shot through me. Discovering alien life was one thing, but to discover a form of life outside our very dimension? Such a thing would leave my name permanently etched in the annals of history, immortalized as the one who first discovered the temporal fly—

I paused. Something about that name sounded familiar. “Temporal fly…” I had just coined that word off the top of my head, and yet I could have sworn I had heard it before somewhere. No, that wasn’t quite right, was it? My brain felt clouded, and the incessant buzzing of these temporal flies certainly wasn’t helping. Temporal flies… no, what was it? I had just heard it recently, I was sure. Temporal flies….

Time flies.

Suddenly, I was jolted from my thoughts by a blaring alarm. My eyes shot over to the terminal. There were at least thirty or forty tiny holes in the shielding now, enough to trigger the emergency systems. A dense cloud of flies buzzed around the room, seemingly growing larger by the second. Without thinking, I slammed my hand down on the abort button, dull pain surging through my shoulder as I moved it. I let out a groan of pain. I could feel the slight rumble of the time machine reversing course. The abort button would take me back to just before I left, so I could warn my past self and avoid making the trip in the first place. Why had I made the trip in the first place? My mind felt foggy.

This wasn’t right. None of this was right. It was supposed to be a simple trip ten years in the past. Why hadn’t I just put it off a bit longer, thought out more possibilities? Could I have avoided this if I had given myself more time? What made me change my mind?

There it was, again. That same realization. I had gotten it just moments prior, and yet it slipped away from me once again. I couldn’t think properly. I felt as if I was on the verge of remembering something incredibly important, putting the pieces together, and yet my mind simply didn’t work in the way that it should. The buzzing of the flies echoed unceasingly throughout my head, drowning out any thoughts I had once had. I could feel more and more of my memories slipping away from me. I wasn’t even quite sure where I was anymore. It was a machine of some kind, but what did it do? All there was were the flies. Time flies. I didn’t know why, but I was sure those words were important. I had to remember them.

The machine jolted, and I collapsed out of my chair onto the floor. Every part of my body ached. The buzzing grew even louder, to the point where I forgot what any other noise sounded like. I could feel them crawling over me. I curled up as best I could, trying to protect my face, but it was no use. It felt as if every last bit of heat in my body had been sucked out. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t move. I just lay there for what could have been seconds, could have been years, could have been millennia. All that I knew was the buzzing, and those two words that yet echoed through what was left of my mind. Time flies. Time flies. Time flies. Time—

*Vorp.*

The buzzing was gone. I couldn’t feel the flies crawling on me anymore. My eyes opened, grasping on to the suddenly new sensation of light. A door creaked open, and I felt warm air flow over me. A crashing sound echoed throughout the room. It was faint, but it was the most wonderful thing I had heard. The buzzing was gone.

Though my eyes were blurry, I saw the faint shape of a person in front of me. I felt a brief spark of lucidity flash by, the fog in my brain clearing up just a bit. I remembered. There was something incredibly important that I had to say, something so important it had managed to persist in my mind when everything else had eroded away. I gathered the last of my energy and raised my hand, grabbing on to the figure’s shirt and pulling them down to me. My body screamed in pain, but I had long grown numb to it. My jaw creaked open, and two words escaped my mouth.

*“Time… flies….”*

1q3788n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3788n,New to collecting - again,"My love for Pokémon has been rekindled thanks to the massive interest my 4-year-old has developed in them. Everything from toys to movies, but most importantly the cards.

Back in the ’90s and early 2000s, I collected the original Pokémon cards. I had the full OG base set, with a few Charizards to spare. At some point I sold my entire collection to a classmate for the huge amount of exactly the price of two Dragon Ball mangas, which back then was around $15. Looking back now... But that’s a sob story for another day.

Now I’m getting back into collecting, inspired by my son and the joy we share when opening packs together—talking about the Pokémon, penny sleeving the cool ones, and putting them in his UP Gengar side-load binder

I’ve set a few personal “rules” for adding cards to my own collection and how to up the enjoyment of it:

1. Cards based on rarity or value (often the same thing).

2. Cards I just find visually stunning, regardless of price.

3. Nostalgia cards—like the small binder of old cards I found that weren’t sold back in the story above.

4. Grading my favorites. Profit doesn’t matter to me; I genuinely enjoy the process and the moment the grade is revealed.

5. Keeping my cards in the best condition possible, no matter their value

6. Still being able to pull the collection out, sit on the couch with a cup of coffee, and just enjoy flipping through it.

So my question is:
What’s the best way to store cards if I want to preserve their condition as much as possible. 

I’ve tried researching this on Reddit and other sites, but the amount of info is overwhelming.

Do i

Penny sleeve + side-loader binder (Vault X, etc.)?

Penny sleeve → top loader → top-loader binder?

Perfect fit(inner sleeve) → penny sleeve → side-loader or top-loader binder?

Other? 

I hope I didn’t break any rules, and sorry for the long post. 

I added a few pictures of my son’s collection (my favorite is the Slakoth—something very calm about that card) and my old find.
Thanks for taking the time to read and/or respond.

I want to talk to my manager about it but I don’t know how to do so appropriately, and thought I’d reach out to fellow managers for some advice!

For context: I started working at a coffee shop this past August where there were previously two managers, one was a floor/hr manager and the other is a production manager. The floor manager left and I filled her shifts but I was not appointed as a manager. So we just have the one manager who I’ll call Jim.  Jim seems to have struggled to adjust to having more responsibilities, not to mention his wife abruptly divorced him in November.  He’s had a tough time, but I am growing disgruntled and feel that I’m picking up general slack. Here is a list of grievances I have:

I am the only full time employee, even Jim isn’t there for more than 25 hours a week. He works on the floor 2 of those days and roasts coffee the others. This means a lot of the floor tasks fall onto me such as general upkeep and making/stocking syrups, ordering, etc. This wouldn’t be an issue if my coworkers were competent at completing their jobs but they are not (with the exception of one person). For them it is either social hour or they are good at keeping up with one task like doing dishes. One girl needs more training, the rest have worked there for far too long and know better. Jim doesn’t even do all of these tasks. Needless to say there is an imbalance of workload here. If I am not working, the people who work the following day are not preparing the openers for success which especially sucks because we open by ourselves. We need a defined list of responsibilities for each shift so the people who work the next day are set up for success.

Jim does not stock things when we run out of them. For example; when we run out of decaf he does not go out of his way to get more. He did not order gift cards when we ran out which was especially problematic over Christmas time when people came in multiple times a day to buy one for their family. It really sucks to have to tell people that we don’t have what they want (especially when every other coffee shop ever\* does\* have). When he doesn’t keep up with these things, we have to suffer the consequences of the uncomfortable conversations with customers. It’s embarrassing and I don’t think he gets that, he lacks people skills in general and doesn’t work on the floor often enough to have to deal with it to an annoying degree. 

Other small things: We get our tips in cash and Jim is not consistent with tipping us out which makes it impossible to have reliable income outside of our hourly checks. He does not communicate with everyone about things and being the only person that everyone works with, I am the sole source of communication about important information. 

I need a solution for these things, I don’t know if that is me being a manager or Jim being held accountable for the ways he is slacking. I’m having a difficult time putting my finger on exactly what the problem is here, and an even more difficult time knowing how to approach this situation. Any advice is helpful.

Overflowing Love: A One Breath Prayer Devotional
================================================

Reflections on an Overflowing Heart
-----------------------------------

Imagine you’re standing in a bustling coffee shop, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloping you. Suddenly, you overhear a conversation that strikes a chord in your heart: “I just want to feel God’s love overflowing in my life.” The sentiment is relatable, isn’t it? Life can sometimes feel like a whirlwind, leaving us disconnected from the love that fuels us. This is where the concept of the “One Breath Prayer” comes in—an intimate and simple approach to connecting with God in the rush of our daily lives.

In just the breath it takes to utter these three words, “Overflowing Love, Lord,” we can align ourselves with God’s heart for us. These words become a sweet reminder—a lifeline—inviting us to experience His love to the fullest.

Understanding “Overflowing Love”
--------------------------------

The idea of “overflowing love” is beautifully depicted in Psalm 23:5 (ESV), which states, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.”

Just imagine your cup, overflowing with goodness, mercy, and grace. When we embrace God’s overflowing love, we begin to see life through His eyes—a lens colored with kindness, acceptance, and incredible strength.

**Here are a few points to consider:**

- **Connection to God:** The One Breath Prayer immediately draws you closer to God, reminding you of His unwavering presence.
- **Positive Affirmation:** It encourages a mindset shift, enabling you to focus on love instead of distractions.
- **Spiritual Renewal:** Regular practice can lead to a transformed life, overflowing with love for others as well.

The Power of a Simple Prayer
----------------------------

A simple prayer can transform your day. The One Breath Prayer is unlike multi-paragraph prayers we might recite in formal settings. Instead, it is spontaneous, intimate, and geared towards our daily interactions. It serves as a reset button to remind ourselves of the love that God so generously pours into our lives.

By taking a deep breath and reciting our One Breath Prayer, we open the door for God to fill our hearts with His love, allowing us to overflow it onto others.

**Things to Remember:**

- This prayer is short enough to be done anytime—on your commute, during lunch, or just before bed.
- It can be shared with others, encouraging them to tap into this powerful moment with God.
- Reflecting on the immense love God has for you can foster gratitude, creating a ripple effect that blesses those around you.

Personal Reflection and Interaction
-----------------------------------

Here’s a question to ponder: How has God’s overflowing love resonated within you?

I invite you to take a moment to journal your thoughts or share your experiences in the comments below. Have you ever felt his love overflowing in your life? How did it change your perspective on a situation?

Consider also the people around you who could benefit from hearing that affirmation: “You are loved, and your life is a reflection of that love.”

**Practice:**

1. Choose a moment—first thing in the morning, mid-afternoon, or before bed.
2. Breathe deeply and say, “Overflowing Love, Lord.”
3. Spend a few minutes in silence, letting His love envelop you.

Your Call to Action
-------------------

The next time you feel overwhelmed or disconnected, remember the simplicity of the One Breath Prayer. Recite “Overflowing Love, Lord,” and watch how it changes your outlook.

Let’s start a conversation! Share below how you plan to incorporate this prayer into your daily life and any stories of how you’ve experienced God’s overflowing love.

It’s time to let your cup overflow, allowing God’s love to be the centerpiece of every moment—after all, that’s where the real magic begins!

Just these past couple of months I’ve been fantasizing the thought of getting picked up & surprised with flowers. The thought of getting picked up and trying a new coffee shop or late night snack run. I’ve fantasized about intimate moments that are unattainable because of stubbornness. After that I’ve been thinking about letting go. 

I love my boyfriend. He’s funny, snarky, tall, good looking, and all I’ve known the past years. I hate to admit though my cup isnt being filled. I am always filling his cup. Not that Im complaining. I love LOVE. I bake for him, I play his favorite games with him. I buy him food and pay attention to the things he needs and likes. I give him rides to work no complaints (his parents use his car 24/7) I love spending time with him. 

I don’t feel like I’m receiving acts of love back sometimes. Not that I expect it but it would feel nice once in a while to hear “do you want anything ?” or “I made you this”. I want to be thought about. I want to be desired. He also has a corn addiction and acts like I don’t know. Always watching thirst traps of girls behind my back and has been a constant problem which I’ve voiced out how it bothers me. I’m pretty attractive myself so I don’t understand why when I also have a high libido yet he doesnt care to get intimate with me. I also have been wanting to try new things in the bedroom or excite things even more. Even have been thinking abt a surprising him with a 3way because I just wanna get active with him and spice things up but he only wants to get intimate on his terms. It’ll just be one position too. I’ve voiced out wanting to try new things and he ignores those conversations. 

I’m not sure where I’m going with this. I’m also afraid if I leave what if the grass isnt really greener on the other side? What if he treats the next girl like I’ve always dreamed of. Idk. I love him and don’t want to lose him. He makes me laugh, he does love me I know that. But what should I do? Feels like a dead end. Even just today he has no car because his parents left out of town with it. I said hey lets catch a new movie then so he can get out of the house. He said no. I said if we can grab a bit or share a lunch it’s a saturday. He said no. I said well lets drive around and find a snack. He said no. All we do is sit in his bedroom and play games or I watch his sports stuff with him. We’re young like with free will I don’t understand why he wont explore with me.

Specs first, because they matter: Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper over Dominican binder and filler. Medium-leaning, not timid. Creamy cedar and light toast up front, clean and composed through the middle, with some baking spice and nuttiness keeping it interesting. And yes—the creamy end was perfect😏🍰. Lightly sweetened, but tasteful. Not gimmicky. It finished strong instead of fading out like too many Connecticuts do.

Construction was dialed in the whole way. Easy draw, straight burn, no touch-ups, no heat spike—even while juggling tongs and a beer. That’s not an accident; that’s good blending and solid rolling.

This isn’t a “breakfast-only, coffee-only” Connecticut. It can hang with food, it stays smooth to the nub, and it never gets sharp or bitter. I finished it thinking, yeah… I need another one of these.

throughout my friendship with this group of people (we’re 5), there have been multiple times where most have flaked out on me on occasions where it mattered most. of course i understand we’re all adults and life gets busy, but i wish they would just have the courtesy of cancelling plans ahead of time and just communicating with me more honestly. i’ve been open about this and held them accountable for the times that they have flaked out on me, but it never seems to change.

here are a couple of examples:

a couple of years ago, there was a solar eclipse happening. i thought it’d be so fun for all of us to see it together, so i asked them as soon as it was announced on the news if they’d be down to see it together. none of them really replied. the ones that did about a week later said that they already had plans to see it with their boyfriends. i was really sad that they preferred to spend this rare moment with someone they had only known a couple months rather than their friends of 5 years at the time. i figured i “just didn’t get it” since i had never been in a relationship before at the time. on the day of the solar eclipse tho, i saw that two of those friends actually saw it together, along with their boyfriends. i felt excluded. 

my last couple of birthdays bummed me out. 2 years ago, a friend made other plans on the day of my party even though they told me they would be free a month in advance. last year, a friend cancelled on me last minute saying they couldn’t afford to go anymore, even though i had accommodated the day of my celebration a month later for her to come. understandably, the birthday celebration was expensive. i wanted to go to a spa with them, but i was very clear that if it wasn’t in their budgets, i wouldn’t mind at all doing something else if it meant they could all be there. they all agreed tho, so of course i assumed we’d all be able go. it didn’t feel very fair to me that she’d cancel the day before after she had told me she would be able to afford it. she had two months to plan for it.

today: one of my friends just got into a relationship, and i feel like i haven’t heard a lot from her in a while, so i asked her if she’d be down to go on a coffee date with me so we could catch up. she told me this day would be good for her two days ago, and i texted her again today to confirm, but she hasn’t replied. she did reply to my story about something else tho. since it was clear she was on her phone and didn’t seem to see my message, i also called. no answer. i just wish she could’ve said something???

i’ve spoken to my therapist about a lot of these times where my friends have flaked out on me, and she seems to agree that their lack of communication is just not nice for me to deal with. i’m stuck on what to do here though. it hurts every time they do it, but they’ve been good friends to me for other reasons and they’re pretty much the only close friends i have. i’m introverted so i’d have a really hard time making new friends. i also just hate antagonizing them because it makes me truly feel lonely. i don’t have anyone besides my therapist to talk about this to.

i just recently got a boyfriend, and ive kinda let him in on the struggles ive had with my friends tho i only give him the surface level cuz i dont like to vent to him, especially since we’ve only just started dating. dating someone has only given more clarity about my friendships tho. i realized that im not like my friends. for example, if it came to seeing the solar eclipse, id still rather do it with them. and lets say i was dating my boyfriend for longer, maybe i would want to have him with me for the eclipse, but id still hate to experience that moment without my friends. i also have a younger sister i love a lot, and most times, i am prioritizing my sister’s happiness over hanging out with my boyfriend. i would also bend over backwards to make it to all my friends birthdays. one of my friends once planned a date with their gf for the day of my birthday. it really hurt me. 

dont get me wrong, i am extremely giddy about my new boyfriend, yet, i still dont let him get in the way of the other relationships that matter to me in my life. like, i could’ve planned to see my boyfriend today, but i really wanted to catch up with my friend *so that* we could talk about our new boyfriends! im so disappointed.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how we can all squeeze more out of our days, not just in terms of getting stuff done, but also in feeling genuinely *good* about it. It's not about burning ourselves out, right? It's about smart, sustainable ways to level up.

I've stumbled upon a few things that have seriously shifted my perspective and my energy levels. Thought I'd share some of the ""aha!"" moments with you all.

*   **The Power of the ""Micro-Win"":** We often get bogged down by huge goals. But what if we broke them down into ridiculously small steps? Completing just one tiny task can create a cascade of motivation. Seriously, try it. Finish one email. Write one sentence. It's surprisingly potent.

*   **Reclaim Your Mornings (or Evenings!):** Whatever time works for you, dedicate just 30 minutes to *you*. No distractions. This could be journaling, meditating, a quick workout, or simply enjoying a quiet cup of coffee. It sets the tone for the entire day.

*   **The ""Unsubscribe"" Mentality:** Think about all the digital noise and commitments that drain your energy. What can you consciously *stop* doing? Saying ""no"" to the non-essential frees up massive mental bandwidth. This applies to social media scrolls, draining conversations, and even certain tasks you can delegate or eliminate.

*   **Joy as a Performance Enhancer:** This is a big one for me. We often associate productivity with seriousness and grind. But what if we actively sought out moments of joy throughout the day? Listening to music while you work, a quick dance break, or even just appreciating a beautiful moment. Joy fuels creativity and resilience.

*   **The ""Prep for Success"" Ritual:** Before you dive into a task, spend 5 minutes organizing your workspace, gathering your materials, and clearly defining the single most important outcome. This simple act of preparation dramatically reduces friction and increases focus.

It's easy to feel overwhelmed, and sometimes life throws us curveballs that can really knock us off our game. If you're ever feeling swamped or struggling to navigate those tough emotional moments, please know there are resources out there to help. I’ve found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) to be incredibly supportive and insightful.

What are some of your favorite ""genius hacks"" for boosting productivity and finding that everyday joy? I’m genuinely curious to hear what’s working for you guys! Let's share and learn from each other. 👇",1,1767475962.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

That pairing is one of the strongest conditioned loops in nicotine addiction:

**Coffee = cue**  
**Nicotine = response**  
**Relief/""focus"" = reward**

When you quit, coffee can trigger intense cravings—not because you actually need nicotine, but because your brain learned the association.

# The Part Most People Don't Know (And It Matters)

If you're quitting cigarettes, coffee may suddenly hit you much harder.

Why? Tobacco smoke accelerates how your liver metabolizes caffeine. When you stop smoking, that ""turbo mode"" shuts off—so your usual cup can feel like you've doubled your dose. This can cause:

- Anxiety/jitters
- Insomnia
- Rapid heart rate
- Irritability

People often mistake these symptoms for nicotine withdrawal, then relapse to ""calm down.""

(If you vape or use pouches only, this caffeine amplification is usually minimal—it's driven by smoke exposure, not nicotine itself.)

 What to Do This Week If You're Quitting

1) Cut caffeine by ~50% for 1–2 weeks (if quitting cigarettes)  
Try half-caf, a smaller cup, or switch to decaf after noon.

2) Optional but strategic it's better not to quit both ""coffee and nicotine"" on the same day. 
You can keep coffee—just reduce the dose and control timing.

3) Break the ritual deliberately
Make coffee in a new location, use a different cup, sit in a different chair, or drink it while walking.

4) Try a replacement ritual (60 seconds):
- 5 deep breaths + cold water
- Gum or mint
- Short walk outside
- Brush teeth immediately after coffee

1q36p8a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q36p8a,"Nagpur has cafes and cultures similar to mumbai and pune, you just need money","Nagpur is often misunderstood by people who never truly experience it. They look at prices, glance at menus, count their cash, and instead of accepting their own limitations, they blame the city. The truth is, Nagpur has a café and food culture that quietly rivals Mumbai and Pune, with thoughtfully designed cafés, calm lounges, rooftop spots, specialty coffee, global cuisines, good music, proper hygiene, safe kitchens, and staff who actually respect the customer. The taste here is mesmerising, not loud or artificial, but rich, balanced, and memorable. From perfectly brewed coffee to slow cooked meals, fresh desserts, and well plated dishes, the food feels intentional. You don’t leave just full, you leave satisfied, knowing what you ate was clean, hygienic, and worth every rupee.

Most people say there is nothing in Nagpur because they experience the city from the cheapest angle possible. They watch the prices, hesitate, and then conclude the city has no culture. If you have money, standards, and taste, Nagpur opens up differently. You drive through wide roads in a good car, park easily, step into a quiet café, order without calculating every bite, and actually enjoy the moment. I’ve seen evenings where families sit for hours, children laughing softly, parents relaxed, food arriving warm and fresh, conversations flowing without rush. There is a certain calm richness in that, a story you don’t get in crowded metros. Weekends here mean taking your family out, meeting valuable people, being around women and men who carry themselves with class, and enjoying quality time without chaos.

Nagpur doesn’t scream luxury, it offers it quietly. The cafés serve delicious food with consistency, hygiene, and comfort, and the city gives you space to enjoy it fully. You don’t come here chasing hype or validation, you come here to feel peace, taste good food, and live slowly with standards. If you can’t afford it, that’s fine, but blaming the city only exposes mindset. Nagpur rewards those who invest, money, taste, and class, and for them, the city reveals its true essence.",2,1767475701.0,nagpur,2,0.75,False

I’m a non-native English speaker and I’ve been working as a front desk cashier at Panera for about 6 days. Yesterday I was suddenly trained on drive-thru, and honestly it felt like a total mess for me.

I’m trying really hard, but because English isn’t my first language, it’s difficult for me to ask my manager all these questions clearly while we’re busy. I’m hoping someone here can explain things step by step.

I understand that drive-thru involves taking orders on POS, handing food to customers, and making drinks, but I’m still very confused about what else I’m responsible for and how the flow actually works.

1. Besides taking orders, handing food to pickup customers, and making drinks — what exactly is the drive-thru person responsible for?

I also noticed that the coworkers helping me on drive-thru are constantly stopping to clean drink tools and beverage containers (like pitchers, bubblers, or drink machine parts), and this really confuses me.

•	How often are drink tools and containers supposed to be cleaned during a shift?

•	Is it something that needs to be washed every time, or only after a certain amount of use or time?

•	How do you know when a container or tool needs to be changed or cleaned?

•	Is there a standard routine or schedule for this, or is it more based on visual cues (empty, dirty, time passed, etc.)?

2.	I often mix up customers.

I don’t know how to match the car at the window with the correct order.

Is there a standard way you keep track of which car/order is next?

3.	Coffee questions:

If a customer says “coffee” but doesn’t specify (decaf, hazelnut, etc.), what is the default?

Should I ask every time, or is there a standard assumption?

4.	Iced tea:

How is iced tea actually made at Panera?

Is it brewed hot first and then poured over ice, or is there a different process?

5.	Screens & systems:

When you’re on drive-thru, besides the POS screen:

•	Do you also have to watch another screen for drinks?

•	Is that screen separate from POS, or do they overlap?

•	Do you press the drive-thru button only after the order is finished, or at another stage?

6.	Overall flow:

If possible, can someone explain the full drive-thru flow from:

•	car arrives

•	order taken

•	drinks made

•	payment

•	food handed out

•	order completed in the system

I really want to do this job well, but being put on drive-thru this early has been overwhelming, especially as a non-native speaker. Any detailed explanation or tips would help a lot.

For example, in 2024, I decided to train and run a 50k race and I did.  In 2025, I failed to set or keep any significant goals (it was a very depressing year).  Didn't even do much running and gained some weight.

Anyway, I realized a month or so ago that I (37F) cannot do the monkey bars...this after I tried to follow my ten-year-old across and wrenched my shoulder hard, lol.  Can't remember the last time I did them successfully, but probably not since I was a young teenager.  So I have decided that for my first goal of the year, I will work up to being able to do them again properly by building grip strength, training upper body, and losing some weight.

My doctor also wants me to work on my cholesterol, so I plan to tweak my diet as well and just see what happens.

Steps: alternate hands with a grip strengthener while cruising/idling in the car, install a pull up bar (did that today) and attempt a under- or over-hand hang (and eventually a pull up) every time I go through that doorway, do an AM/PM set of pushups and curls, and stop by the park a couple times a week to do some experimental swings/hangs on the monkey bars.

Specific diet changes: no more daily coffee with cream, high-fiber vs high fat breakfast, smaller portions at dinner.

Will report back in a month on how this is going.",2,1767475393.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

""Morning light crept through the blinds, cutting thin silver lines across the kitchen counter. Sheryl stood beside the coffee pot, thumb sliding over her phone screen. No new messages. No missed calls.

She exhaled slowly. “That’s strange,” she murmured. “I called Karen several times last night, but she never picked up.”

Derek looked up from his bowl of cereal, one eyebrow raised. “You want me to drive over and check on her?”

Sheryl shook her head, forcing a smile. “No. I’m sure she’s fine. Things happen. Maybe her phone died or she went to bed early.” She paused, as if trying to convince herself. “It’s all good.”

1q36ib1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BehaviorAnalysis/comments/1q36ib1/toxic_or_crazy_friend/,Toxic or crazy friend?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

1q36ein,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1q36ein/gifts_for_picky_mom/,Gifts for picky mom,"I have no budget but would prefer to stay under $200 - above that is okay though! I’d prefer to not do giftcards unless that’s the only good option. 

She does not like: jewelry, working out, perfumes, lotions, cooking, baking, bottles/cups, coffee/teas (doesn’t even really drink much water), “clutter”, spas, nails being done, traveling by herself and/or doing “vacation” stuff on her own, acts of service (car detailing package, maid service, etc. - she doesn’t want to have to go somewhere for it & doesn’t like strangers to be in her home).

She is indifferent or has been picky on: purses/wallets, clothing, shoes, personalized sun catchers of her favorite beach, printed photos, digital picture frames.

She likes: upgrades to current items (I have upgraded her entire bathroom from towels to curtains, new bedding, etc.), door dashing and getting food, perms, going to chiropractors (something I’m not really comfortable supporting), the ocean. She’s also been big on: reading, watching TV, playing games on her phone recently that “work her brain”

Other info on her: She is almost 60, about to be a grandma for the first time, doesn’t do much outside of going to work and back home. I live far away and am unable to do experiences with her. My grandma usually covers my mom’s hair/perm appointments throughout the year. ",2,1767474993.0,Gifts,10,1.0,False

This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting our group and making the space available for a private community gathering.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

1q36e57,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q36e57,Thursday Boot Company - Builder - Black Coffee Chromexcel,"Recently received my new Thursday Builders in Black Coffee Chromexcel, super happy with them. The Builder seems like a bit of a sleeper; I don't see it pop up on social media nearly as often as the Captain or Diplomat, and this specific leather is fairly new. Released in November I believe. I’d imagine there probably just aren’t a ton of people going for Thursdays at the $350 price point, but I think they deserve more recognition. Pretty impressed with the product they’ve put together.

The Black Coffee Chromexcel works nicely, in the right lighting, the depth is fantastic. In a dim hallway, they pass for a fairly standard black, but the moment you get them under some sunlight, the reflections shift and reveal rich espresso undertones. It isn't a loud color, but it has a complexity that stands out in comparison to a lot of other brown leathers. Seems to respond very well to brushing (as I’d expect from chromexcel). A good brush blends everything back together and makes them pop just a bit.

The stitchdown construction is cleanly done. Very few loose thread ends and no messy joints. Fully gusseted tongue tucks neatly and doesn’t create any uncomfortable pressure points.

This is my first pair of stitchdown, full leather construction boots. I can feel the difference in the heel and insole. Standing, the boot feels stable and has a slight give before firming up for support. Reminds me of my purple mattress in a way. I tried the Diplomat first and just couldn’t make it work.

 

The Builder feels significantly more roomy. Much more comfortable for me personally. I’d imagine it’s just being built on different lasts, but the diplomat does \*not\* fit my foot. I went through the wringer with sizing on the diplomat. Tried a 12.5EE (too large all around), a 12D (too narrow at the ball), and a 12EE (too wide everywhere but the toe box). The Builder in 12D fits perfectly. The toe box is noticeably roomier, and the heel locks securely without putting uncomfortable pressure.

For $350, I’m happy. Overall, it’s a robust, well-proportioned, nicely constructed boot. The leather is the star here IMO, I expect it’s going to have a phenomenal patina in a few years. Confident these are going to be a staple in the rotation for a long time.

Shoutout to their Black Label packaging too, they came in separate drawstring bags inside a nice magnetic closure box with a certificate of authenticity. Cool little touches.",12,1767474969.0,goodyearwelt,2,0.83,False

Cry if u want. Be sad if u want. Pray if u want. You are not alone. Stay alive. Cut sugar (sweets, soda) it messes up your head - trust me I know.

She was really cool and I liked her as a friend. The next year she changed schools and we stopped talking until I, half a year later, contacted her. We started talking a lot, like everyday, and looking back on it she was probably my best friend at the time. To be honest I also kinda got a crush on her but I never said anything. After being friends for maybe a year (not too sure) I realised that we only talked when I messaged first. It felt like I had to remind her to talk to me. So I stopped, if she said something first I wouldve gladly answered, but she didnt. So the relationship faded and she eventually unadded me. 

Now it’s been like 2-3 years and I miss her, I really do. I do think that she wasn’t the only part in the split, I was really stuck to her and immediately answered when she sent anything. I wanted to talk everyday and looking back on it, it probably wasn’t extremely healthy. For neither of us. 

I thought about her for the first time in a couple months, a couple days ago but decided I would contact her again in maybe a few years, you know, I wanted to let us both grow up a bit more before trying again. But now, ugh I really miss her. 

I know its not a real crush, you know I havent talked to her in years she has surely changed. But I wouldn’t mind learning about the new her and I ofcourse wont ask her out directly. 

I am thinking if I maybe should contact her soon. Maybe ask if she wanna go grab some coffee or something one day.

Quick philosophy question.,"Just switched to MacroFactor after years on MFP. Still getting used to it. Importing recipes and custom foods from MFP was… not fun, but manageable.

I had a couple of questions on MF’s philosophy, especially given the AI-driven coaching:
	1.	Do you log things that are not materially meaningful for calories, but might matter contextually?
Examples: black coffee (multiple cups), LMNT/electrolytes, multivitamin gummies, etc.
From a pure calorie perspective they’re noise, but does MF benefit from seeing them for pattern recognition or adherence context?

	2.	How precise do you get with logging, especially when eating out?
MF seems to encourage precision, which I like. But I’m finding that a lot of restaurant items live in the MFP database and not MF. That means manual entry or approximation, which adds friction.
Do most people just estimate with generic entries, or is there a better workflow?

Net net: I like the rigor and the coaching model so far, just trying to understand where MF actually benefits from extra data vs where “close enough” is fine.

Curious how long-time MF users think about this.

He is 75 and she is 75.

Anyways, My dad is forgetting and moving things and throwing them away and giving them away. He tried to give my uncle a model ship and radio. He gives his friends at coffee food in the house. He can rearrange quickly too, I find tin foil moved and in the garage in a weird place. The girlfriend will come over for expensive steak dinners and is always going out to eat with my dad. She went to Walmart grocery shopping and then the next stop was out house. all I noticed in her car was ensure and it hit me that my dad was feeding her most of her meals. She may only be drinking that in the morning and coming over later for dinner. She got my dad to buy chocolate and she told him to keep it at her house or he would eat it all and he forgot he bought it. Expensive stuff too. She even choose the store he would take her too to buy it. She had him cook ribs for Christmas. He had 80 dollars of ribs and she said store it at my place and rhen said let's not give the ribs for Christmas let's save them for new years. My dad came home.from the Christmas party and I asked where is the pan, and he said we got it. She washed it whenni was at her house and she put the ribs in the freezer and I said well where is it? And he got upset and we never got it back yet. I do not know if he processed what I said or forgot the pan was his or thinks they are married or maybe he even thinks she is my mom who had passed away. I have no idea. 

But I started to look in the cupboards and about 75 percent of our kitchen is gone. Entire shelves are missing items. All my moms good baking pans are gone and replaced with cheap items I see no one can give away at garage sales. All the pens are dried out but we have 50 of them. Expensive ones too. All the charging cords do not work but a few but there is a drawer full, and it goes on an on, the fishing supplies are gone, but for the large tackle boxes and about 5 fishing poles but the boxes are empty of lures!!! We are missimg like 3 crock pots and the turkey pan and all the pyrex dishes, the nice crystal dishes, the cast iron pans, omg. I have seen her go shopping with my dad and she tells him to buy more batteries and soap for himseld and then he brings it home and now we have access batteries and soap but then she excuses herself into the pantry and then batteries are missing when i go look. She has a house key too. And she yelled at my Dad when I first moved home that i hope she (referring to me) does not change the lock. She said this while knocking over an item/cushion i had sitting by the door over that was mine as she left with my Dad. My Dad is so out of it he did not even see it. She called me once and got upset I did not answer and drove over and let herself in. I have tolder her that you can not do that. You got to ring the doorbell. She was coming over everyday and staying late when i first moved my boxes home and  then I secured then where she could not touch them and she is now over 2x a week. She was spitting food out of her mouth and on the floor for the dog to eat too and I said you cannot do that. Note: she had an active cold sore and she verbally got nasty. She stopped doing it but started back up again when she felt the floor was dirty. Justifying it by saying but I always do it.

She told my dad and me that we could not come over for Thanksgiving dinner and said I was why cause I left her Christmas party early 6 years ago, a detail i do not even remember. I remember staying the whole time too. She glares at me and everything she says is an indirect insult that my dad does not pick up on and she vilifies me to my dad and says I am spoiled. Ot if i lay down geound rules, no spitting food on the floor, she says, ""Youre daufhter is so mean."" I play a cello and she kept telling my dad i gave up on it but i was recouping drom the move. It always takes me awhile yo recouperate from a move and then i am back at my hobbies. She has influenced my family and met rhem all too. And she call 8 , 9+ times a day. She calls my dad when he wakes up, when he goes out calls an hour later. And when he cashed in a check for savings for retirement she was constantly calling and then yelled at him that he did not call when he signed it. And she has been demanding money and access to finances. And he said no that time but I have no idea what else is going only. I need help, advice and support. It is very traumatizing.

\---------------------------------------------

THE GOSPEL OF THE OPEN ROAD IS WRITTEN IN OIL AND SCAR TISSUE

1. Thou shalt seek the wisdom of the professional instructor and the orange cone. Your buddy who has been riding for twenty years probably has terrible habits that will get you into trouble. Take a real class every few years to keep your skills sharp.
2. Thou shalt wrap thy flesh in the armor of the beast and the weave of the fiber. The pavement is a giant belt sander and it does not care about your fashion choices or how short the trip is. Buy the best gear your budget allows and wear every piece of it every single time you swing a leg over the seat.
3. Thou shalt honor the mechanical spirit of the machine before every journey. Check your tire pressure and look for leaks or loose bolts before you ever think about clicking into gear. Finding out your brakes are shot while you are flying toward a stop sign is a bad way to start the weekend.
4. Thou shalt bear the full weight of thy own survival with a sober heart. We accept a level of danger that car drivers will never understand so there is no excuse for adding more risk. Own every mile and realize that your safety is entirely your own problem to solve.
5. Thou shalt cast thy pride into the gutter before the engine starts to roar. Let the teenagers and the angry drivers have their little victories while you focus on staying upright. Showing off for strangers is a fast way to find yourself in the weeds with a broken bike and a bruised ego.
6. Thou shalt master the fire of thy temper and the surge of thy hormones. Riding while you are steaming mad or overly excited is a recipe for slow reflexes and terrible choices. If your head is not in the right place you should just stay in the garage and tinker until the storm passes.
7. Thou shalt look upon every driver as a wandering blind psycho out to hunt thee. Assume every blinker is a lie and every car at an intersection is waiting for the worst possible moment to pull out. When you expect people to be idiots you are never surprised by their total lack of awareness.
8. Thou shalt yield the road when the flesh grows heavy and the mind begins to wander. Pushing through exhaustion is just as dangerous as riding after a few beers. Stop for a coffee or a nap the moment you start zoning out or missing your turns on the highway.
9. Thou shalt dwell in the sanctuary of the open lane and the wide buffer zone. Keep a massive bubble of space around you so you always have a place to go when things go wrong. Never linger in a blind spot or get boxed in by large trucks that cannot see you.
10. Thou shalt lift thy gaze to the horizon and the path far ahead of thy wheel. Look through the corner to where you want to go instead of staring at the road right in front of you. Your bike follows your eyes so keep them scanning for sand and oil well before you reach it.
11. Thou shalt temper the fury of the engine in the presence of the law and the crossroad. Speed is a wonderful tool but it will also shrink your reaction time down to nothing when a car pulls out. Save the high speed runs for the track where there are no minivans and no side streets to worry about.
12. Thou shalt fear the oil of the earth and the weeping of the sky above. The road turns into a skating rink the moment the rain starts to lift the grime to the surface. Smooth out all your inputs and give yourself twice as much room to stop when the pavement is wet.
13. Thou shalt walk thy own path among the brethren of the road even in a crowd. Never feel forced to keep up with a faster rider if you are feeling out of your depth. A real group of friends will wait for you at the next turn and respect your pace.
14. Thou shalt rehearse the day of the sudden stop in the quiet and empty places. Spend some time in a parking lot practicing how to stop as fast as possible without locking your wheels. You want that muscle memory to take over the second a deer jumps out in front of you.
15. Thou shalt nourish the clay with water and the spirit with proper rest. Dehydration makes you slow and stupid which are the two worst things a rider can be on two wheels. Keep a bottle of water handy and eat a decent meal so your brain stays locked on the mission.",2,1767474703.0,motorcycles,3,0.58,False

1q368gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1q368gv/unsaid_vibrations/,Unsaid Vibrations,"He met her by accident, the kind that doesn’t announce itself. He wasn’t looking for love—he was looking for quiet. A coffee, a place to sit, a life that didn’t ask much of him. Then she smiled at him like she already knew him, like she’d been waiting for him to stop long enough to be seen.
He loved her without preparation. Without armor. It surprised him how fast it happened, how deeply it settled into his chest. Loving her felt less like falling and more like remembering something he’d always carried.
Time, though, is a jealous thing. It crowded him. Work piled up, days blurred, responsibilities tightened their grip. He grew tired in ways sleep didn’t fix. To her, it looked like distance. Like his hands lingered less, like his eyes wandered elsewhere, like his words had gone thin.
But inside him, nothing had faded.
He loved her with a devotion that didn’t know how to speak. He noticed everything—things she didn’t think counted. The faint scar she hid without realizing he’d memorized it. The way her body curved into his like it belonged there. The quiet heat between them when they lay tangled together, skin warm, breath slow, the world reduced to the sound of her heart against his chest.
He wanted to tell her. God, he wanted to tell her.
That when he touched her, it wasn’t habit—it was grounding. That when he kissed her slowly, deliberately, it was because he was trying to say everything his mouth didn’t know how to form. That his desire for her wasn’t loud, but constant—something deep, steady, consuming.
But he was built wrong for speeches. Love lived in him like a locked room—full, overflowing, and unseen.
So she mistook his silence for absence. His exhaustion for indifference. She didn’t see that he was carrying her with him through every long day, replaying the memory of her skin under his palms, the way she softened when she trusted him enough to be vulnerable.
He loved her in glances he thought she missed. In the way he always reached for her in his sleep. In how his body still knew hers by instinct alone.
And in the end, he understood something that broke him and steadied him all at once.
That loving her wasn’t enough if he couldn’t show it the way she needed. That holding on while failing her was a quieter kind of harm. That sometimes love isn’t staying—it’s stepping back.
So he let her go.
Not because his love was small, but because it was too real to keep her trapped in his silence. He let her go for her, so she could be seen the way she deserved. And he let her go for himself, knowing that loving someone also means knowing when your hands—no matter how gentle—can no longer hold them the right way.",18,1767474595.0,UnsentLetters,5,0.95,False

I’m using James Hoffman’s one cup v60 recipe. I don’t have a gooseneck kettle, but he mentions in his video that it’s not a must have. 

I’ve attracted a picture of the flatbed after the pour over finished. The draw down time is 3 mins and 10 seconds. As for the beans I’m using a blend from a local roaster it didn’t mention the origin but the description is: 

“A bright, balanced and juicy espresso with nutty, chocolate body with cherry and citrus notes.”

As I’m writing this I’m realising I’ve bought beans made for espresso and not filter 😭. I’m hoping it’s not a complete waste of money….

after a lot of consideration i got a kingrinder k2. even this grinder was more than i really wanted to pay, but a good electric grinder just was going to be too expensive. way way too expensive

i tried another grinder a long time ago (a very cheap, shitty one that wasnt for espresso). i had trouble with it, but i dismissed much of it as being due to the very poor ergonomics of it. i assumed that this would be easier... not really.

i have muscular dystrophy. its a relatively mild form, not the kind that makes me rely on a wheelchair, but i still have stick thin arms that feel useless a lot of the time. i cant use the grinder normally. it just wont happen. i try to hold the grinder between my legs while i grind it. that helps, but its still very agonizing and it still gets 'stuck'.

ok. ill just use a drill, right?

im too fucking weak to be able to hold the drill in place. if i turn it on, it rotates my hand because i cant exert enough force to transfer the rotation to the grinder

im tired. i dont know what to do. i was so excited to be able to freshly grind my own beans and get better shots with it, but apparently i was too stupid and naive to think i could use a fucking coffee grinder. i dont wanna trail off into an unrelated rant, but this disease controls every facet of my life as is, you know? every single part of it. its upsetting that i cant even enjoy a hobby without that shit getting in the way. i dont want to have to ask my mom to grind my beans every time i want to make espresso. ive already had to do it over twice, because this is my first time using a grinder and it was too coarse both times. like how many times am i gonna have to try to get the coarseness right? i cant ask someone to do it for me every single time

# Your Guide to Buying the HiBREW H10 Plus Coffee Maker

Dreaming of barista-quality coffee at home? The HiBREW H10 Plus is a popular choice for its versatility and performance. If you're wondering where to get your hands on this impressive coffee machine, here's a breakdown of the best options.

For the most direct experience and potentially immediate availability, your local electronics retailers or specialty kitchen appliance stores are worth checking. While selection can vary, these brick-and-mortar locations allow you to see the H10 Plus in person before purchasing.

However, the widest selection and often the most competitive pricing for the HiBREW H10 Plus can be found online. Major e-commerce platforms are your best bet. These sites typically offer detailed product descriptions, customer reviews, and a range of sellers, making it easier to compare prices and shipping options.

Consider checking the official HiBREW website as well. Sometimes, manufacturers offer exclusive bundles or the latest models directly through their own online stores. Plus, buying direct can sometimes offer peace of mind regarding warranty and customer support.

*   **Online Marketplaces:** Look for the HiBREW H10 Plus on platforms like Amazon, eBay, or AliExpress for broad selection and competitive pricing.
*   **Official Brand Website:** The HiBREW site might offer direct sales, updates, and support.
*   **Electronics Retailers:** Check major electronics stores or specialized kitchen appliance shops for in-person shopping.

Ready to upgrade your home coffee experience? Explore these options to find the best deal on your new HiBREW H10 Plus.

My face stung so strongly, the strong breeze did nothing but make the cold colder. Walking was so straining. So incredibly straining. The snow was up to my waist.

I was nearly home, so close yet so far.

When I finally arrived, I immediately put the bricks of coffee into my cabinet and the cartons of milk into my fridge. Why does winter have to be like this?

The bones that he left on my table were still there. A fox skull and some other bones I couldn’t identify. That bastard thinks he can get away with this. Fucking with me. Why is everybody fucking with me?

I went down to my basement and opened my tome. I started to draw what my mind willed, and soon enough I could see them again. The small, flashing specks of light that floated in the room with me. They spun around me, I tried to succumb to them but I was still too annoyed. I needed to succumb. Succumb to them. With little hesitation I started to draw what my mind willed on to my own body. No blade was needed, not this time, the pen was enough. It burned as I etched the scribbles to my body. The smell was like of battery acid and burnt hair. It was foul, yet I was in the deepest of ecstasies. I will succumb to them.

I woke up, standing in the middle of my living room. He walked and took his bones from my table. The bones started to integrate into his body has he walked away. As if God themselves were welding the two remnants of life together to form a malignant cancer on the earth. Why was God like this? Who am I to seek if not God?

The next morning I woke up and brewed myself some coffee. I started to look back at what I had drawn on the tome yesterday. A bliss that is not conceivable or describable covers me.

Two years ago, the relationship ended. I lived in **Texas**, she lives in **Belgium**. I saw her two years ago in Belgium in the summer time after the breakup and she was very clear: **it was over**.

Five Months later, in **October**, she flew to **New York** for her birthday. She told me she was there. I visited her. And we spent **three days together**, connected again, and it felt real. Then she left.

For a few weeks after that, we stayed in contact. Then, once again, **she disappeared**. No explanation. No closure.

Later, by coincidence, I received a **job offer in Belgium** and moved there. From the outside, it looked like fate. From the inside, it became something else.

Once I got to Belgium, I messaged her. She responded and we spoke and  spent **four days together**. Then she told me  again that we **cannot see each other anymore**. She stopped responding.

I literally live **20 minutes away from her**. I didn't get a single message. Not once. Not to ask how am I  doing in a foreign country. Not even a “how are you.”

Then I **randomly ran into her**. I ended up back at her place. It didn’t mean anything. It wasn’t a reunion. It wasn’t a restart but it felt like it to me. A few days later, I saw her again. You hugged her. Kissed her cheek. But didn’t go home with her. I said are you single she said yes. 

Two days after that, I saw her **walking with another man**. That moment broke me.

I lost control. I said things that I regret. I walked away, came back to apologize, and she told me to **fuck off** and to stop contacting her.

After that, I saw her twice at a coffee shop that I go to often. She looked at me with **pure hostility**.

Then she disappeared again for **five to six months** I never saw her.

During that time, I actually started healing. I was letting go. She still lived in my head and in my thoughts, but she no longer controlled me. I didn’t message her. I was ok with what ever destiny had in store. 

Then, just before **New Year’s Eve on the 30th. I** saw her **again**, crossing the street with another man.

My body reacted before your mind could. My legs shook. You felt like everything collapsed.

Later, then I messaged her politely  wishing her well for the New Year.

And now I'm on this thread , asking:

* Why am I **still not over her** after two years? What do I do? I just want to heal, I want to be free and never to think of her again? I need help. 
* Should I **leave Belgium**?

Why are they so averse to using soap and cleaners?,"I've worked about 6-7 jobs throughout my life in food service (nursing home kitchens, coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants), and pretty much all of my older coworkers actively chose not to wash their hands with soap, use the sanitizer cleaners provided, or any other cleaning agents. Even after being talked to by management.

It's only people in my generation (millennial) and younger (gen-z) that I've seen follow proper procedures when it comes to hand-washing and cleaning. 

I've had a manager have a whole conversation with a 60+ coworker about washing her hands *with* soap to avoid cross contamination with nuts, and she just chuckled and kinda scoffed at her. 

I'm convinced that they just were not educated on germs or how soap works to sanitize? Or they just don't believe germs exist?

Is this a generational issue?

And before anyone asks, no there was no point in reporting this because many of my jobs had frequent visits from the health department and they usually don't care. Sometimes management was doing the same thing, and didn't bother disciplining staff over this.

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

**About Me:** Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

**What I’m Like:** Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

**What I’m Looking For:** I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

**Dealbreakers:** tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

1q35eyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1q35eyi/my_f50y_friend_used_me_and_my_family/,My F50y friend used me and my family,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship finish''",1,1767472622.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for advice specifically on lighting and worktop options for my kitchen.

I’m aware the space needs some decluttering and general tidying (and repainting), but I’m deliberately not planning a full refurb. I expect to be here for around two years, so I’m trying to make sensible, low-to-mid cost improvements rather than anything major or permanent.

I’d really appreciate suggestions on:

1. How to improve the lighting (especially where ceilings slope or cabinets block light and the main light fitting). I will fix the electrics in the top cupboard and at the back under the last cabinet.

2. Worktop ideas that will look good and are durable! The coffee machine and rice cooker take a beating and there's always water and steam around the surfaces. I don't respect wood (IYKYK).

I remember the hum of the fridge, the ticking wall clock that’s always five minutes fast, and the smell of burnt toast because I forgot it again. The weird part is that at around 1 PM, my memories just… restart. Before that moment, everything is foggy, distant, like remembering a dream you didn’t write down. I wasn’t stressed, I wasn’t emotional, I was just existing in a simple, almost blank way. No worries. No expectations. Peaceful, in a way I didn’t realize I’d been missing.

Then, sometime around 2 PM, it was like someone flipped a switch. Suddenly I was fully aware, fully grown, fully me—with memories, responsibilities, a phone full of notifications, and a relationship I apparently had been in for a while. My back hurt for no reason, I had that low-level anxiety adults carry like background noise, and my brain immediately started running through things I needed to do but wouldn’t. I checked the time twice because I genuinely thought I’d lost hours. Everything around me was consistent—same room, same furniture, same half-folded laundry chair—but *I* wasn’t. It felt like I’d been dropped into the middle of my own life without a tutorial.

That’s when I noticed my girlfriend in the living room. She was sitting cross-legged on the rug, wearing one of my hoodies, the TV paused on some reality show neither of us actually watches. She was talking softly, smiling in that relaxed way she used to reserve for late-night conversations with me. The dog was sitting in front of her, completely focused, tail barely moving. I stood there longer than I want to admit, holding my phone, pretending to scroll so I wouldn’t interrupt. The room smelled faintly like dog shampoo and coffee gone cold. It wasn’t inappropriate—just intimate in a way that made me feel like I’d walked in on something I wasn’t part of anymore.

As the afternoon went on, the details stacked up. She asked the dog if he wanted to go out before she even acknowledged me. She laughed when he tilted his head, but barely reacted when I tried to joke about how weird my day felt. When I finally said something—nothing accusatory, just “Hey, did I do something wrong?”—she sighed like I was asking for too much. She said things like, “You’ve been distant lately,” and “He’s always here for me.” That hurt more than I expected. I watched as she automatically reached down to pet him during conversations, the way she used to reach for my hand. I noticed stupid things, like how she remembered his feeding schedule perfectly but forgot I had an appointment that day.

By the evening, the house felt different. The lights were too bright, the walls too quiet. I ate leftovers standing up while she sat on the couch with the dog curled beside her, already half asleep. I ended up in the spare room, staring at the ceiling fan wobble slightly as it spun, thinking about how bizarre it is to feel replaced without a clear moment where it happened. I don’t think she set out to hurt me. I think I just… re-entered my own life too late. Now I’m an adult with memories that feel borrowed, trying to process heartbreak that technically happened the same day I started fully existing.

My current favorite is Burberry Goddess Intense. The tobacco note took a minute for me, but that’s actually what I like about it now. It feels warm, deep, lasts all day, and is interesting. The downside is it leans very boss serious energy, so I’m looking for something more feminine and sexy for going out.
I tried Burberry Goddess EDP thinking it would be a softer version and it was not what I expected at all. On me it smells bright and almost fruity, honestly like raspberry, and I don’t get lavender or depth from it.
Some stuff I’ve liked or used before:
Maurices Endlessly, I really like this one
Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth (pink) was a go to for a while
Sol de Janeiro 75 in my hair
I always use EOS vanilla lotion, body oil, and a vanilla or coconut body wash, so I already smell sweet
I don’t mind coffee notes, but Black Opium Glitter was recommended to me and it did not work. It smelled sharp and kind of pinchy on me, not warm or sexy.
What I don’t like:
Bright fruity smells
Tart or sharp scents
Anything that feels sour, loud, or candy sweet in a cheap way
What I do like:
Vanilla, gourmand, warm scents
Feminine florals like rose or lavender as long as they are soft
Depth and longevity
Scents that make people say what is that, not just smell nice and disappear
I’m open to designer or niche and totally fine with layering too. If you like warm vanillas with depth and no sharp fruit, I’d love recommendations.",1,1767472379.0,FemFragLab,5,1.0,False

I wish that was all I was seeing.,"I don’t know if this is a confession or a warning. Maybe it’s just a scream into the void, because I can’t scream out loud anymore. I have to be quiet. For her.

For six years, I was a night-shift nurse on a long-term geriatric ward. If you want to know what it’s like to see the human body fail in every conceivable way, slowly and without fanfare, that’s the job for you. It’s not like the ER, all flashing lights and adrenaline. It’s the opposite. It’s the slow, quiet dimming of a bulb. My job, as I saw it, was to manage the dimming. To make sure the fuses didn’t blow too spectacularly on the way out. Change the sheets, administer the meds, chart the decline. It sounds cold, I know. But after a few years, you have to build a wall. You see so much loss, so much slow-motion decay, that if you let it all in, you’d drown. My wall was made of cynicism and exhaustion.

The nights are the worst. The ward takes on a different character after midnight. The daytime bustle of family visits and physical therapists is gone, replaced by a profound, humming silence, punctuated by the rhythmic sigh of a ventilator or the lonely beep of a heart monitor. The air gets thick with the smell of antiseptic and something older, something like dust and regret. My world shrank to the nurses' station, a small island of harsh fluorescent light in an ocean of darkened rooms. My main companion was the bank of security monitors.

They were old, cheap things. The feed was grainy, black and white, with a low frame rate that made everything look jerky and unreal. I’d watch the screens, my eyes tracing the vague, sleeping shapes in the beds, making sure no one was trying to climb out of their rails, no one was in distress. It was mostly a form of meditation, a way to pass the hours until the sun came up and I could go home to my own quiet, empty apartment.

That’s when I first started seeing it.

It wasn't something you'd notice right away. I didn’t. For weeks, maybe months, I probably saw it and my brain just edited it out, filed it under ‘bad reception’ or ‘light flare’. It looked, for lack of a better word, like heat. A shimmer. The kind you see rising off asphalt on a blistering summer day. A distortion in the air, a patch of reality that seemed to be vibrating at a different frequency.

It only ever appeared on the monitors. And it only ever appeared in one place: hovering directly over a patient’s bed.

The first time I clearly registered it was with a man in Room 308. He was a retired mailman, ninety-something, his mind long gone to dementia but his body stubbornly clinging on. I glanced at the monitor for his room and saw it – a wavering, vaguely man-shaped column of static and haze hanging over his bed. It had no features, no color, just this intense, silent vibration that made the grainy image of the man beneath it seem to warp and bend.

My first thought was a technical issue. A short in the camera, maybe. I got up, stretched, and walked down the hall to his room. The corridor was silent except for the squeak of my own rubber-soled shoes. I pushed the door open gently. The room was still, cool. The only light was the faint orange glow from his IV pump. The air was perfectly clear. The man was sleeping, his breath a shallow, rattling thing. Nothing was there. I checked his vitals, adjusted his blanket, and went back to the nurses' station.

On the monitor, the shimmer was gone.

Three hours later, at the end of my shift, the man in 308 passed away.

We called the family. The day shift handled the body. I went home, slept, and didn’t think much of it. Coincidence.

A week later, it happened again. Room 312. A woman who had outlived all three of her children. On the monitor, I saw the same heat-haze, the same silent, shimmering distortion hanging over her frail form. This time, I didn't hesitate. I walked straight down there. Again, the room was still and empty. The air was clear. I stood there for a full minute, just listening to her ragged breathing, feeling the hairs on my arms stand up for no reason I could name. I went back to the desk. The shimmer was gone from the screen. She was gone by morning.

This time, I was there when her daughter called. I picked up the phone. She was sobbing, but there was something else in her voice, too. Confusion.

""I don't understand,"" she said, her voice thick with grief. ""I was just with her yesterday afternoon. She was lucid, you know? For a minute. She was holding my hand.""

""I'm so sorry for your loss,"" I said, the standard line.

""But she... she kept squinting at me,"" the daughter continued, her voice trembling. ""She asked me who I was. She said... she said she couldn't see my face. Just a blur. She sounded so scared.""

I gave her the hospital's other standard line. The one we gave when the dying brain started to misfire. ""It's a common phenomenon,"" I said, my voice sounding hollow even to myself. ""In the final stages, the brain can have difficulty processing visual information. It's just a part of the process, a symptom of the body shutting down.""

She accepted it, of course. What else could she do? But her words stuck with me. *She said she couldn't see my face.*

The pattern started to become undeniable. A few weeks would pass, then I’d see the shimmer on the monitor in a patient’s room. I’d go to check, find nothing, and within a day, that patient would be gone. And then, like clockwork, the phone calls. Always the same story, with slight variations.

""My son flew in all the way from the coast,"" one man told me, his voice choked. ""His mother looked right through him. Asked him why a stranger was crying in her room.""

""She was terrified,"" a young woman whispered over the phone. ""She kept saying, 'Your voice is so familiar, but I don't know you. Where are your eyes?'""

*He couldn't see me.*

*She didn't know who I was.*

*Just a blur.*

Every time, we’d give the official explanation. Hypoxia. Terminal agitation. Brain function decline. And every time, I felt a cold knot tighten in my stomach. Because I knew. I knew it wasn't a symptom of dying.  The shimmer on the screen, this heat-haze creature… it was doing something. It was there, and then they were gone, and the last thing they experienced was the face of their loved one dissolving into a meaningless abstraction.

I tried to tell someone once. A senior nurse I respected. I phrased it carefully, talking about the camera glitches and the strange coincidence of the family reports. She just gave me a tired look and told me to take a few days off. ""This place gets to you,"" she'd said, patting my arm. ""You're seeing ghosts in the machine. Get some sleep.""

So I kept it to myself. I started calling it the Scavenger in my head. It felt right. It wasn't killing them; they were already dying. It was just… feeding on something on its way out. Something from the wreckage. I became a connoisseur of the low-resolution feed from our ancient security system. I learned to distinguish the shimmer from a dust mote floating in front of the lens, or a trick of the low light. It was an organic, pulsing thing, and seeing it on the screen made my blood run cold. My cynicism, my carefully constructed wall, began to crumble. I was a witness.

And then my grandmother fell.

She was the one who raised me. My rock. My entire family history condensed into one stubborn, fiercely loving woman who smelled of cinnamon and old books. She broke her hip. A simple fall, but at her age, a simple fall is a death sentence delivered by gravity. The surgery went as well as it could, but the recovery was brutal. Infections. Complications. Delirium. One day, she was in the main hospital, the next, they were transferring her. To my ward.

My world tilted on its axis. The place I had managed to emotionally wall myself off from, the place that was just a job, suddenly became the most terrifying place on Earth. Because now, the Scavenger wasn't just some abstract horror I observed from a distance. It was hunting in my home.

I pulled every string I could, took on every extra shift. I basically lived at the hospital. My colleagues thought I was being the devoted grandson. They had no idea I was standing guard. My life became a ritual of fear. I’d do my rounds, dispensing medication, changing dressings, all with a knot of dread in my gut. And then I’d sit at the nurses' station, my eyes glued to one monitor in particular. The small, grainy, black-and-white window into my grandmother’s room.

Every flicker of the screen, every shadow, sent a jolt of panic through me. I saw the Scavenger everywhere. In the reflection on the linoleum floor. In the steam rising from a cup of coffee. I was unraveling. The other nurses started giving me wide berth. I was jumpy, irritable, my eyes wide and bloodshot from lack of sleep and an overdose of caffeine.

I spent the time I wasn't at the monitor in her room, holding her hand. She was mostly sleeping, frail and small in the oversized hospital bed. But sometimes she’d wake up, and her eyes, clouded with pain and medication, would find mine.

""There you are,"" she'd whisper, her voice a dry rustle. And she’d smile. A real smile.

And I would think, *It won’t take this. I won’t let it.*

I needed a plan. I couldn't just watch and wait for it to appear. I had to be able to do something. The thing was only visible on the camera. It was invisible to the naked eye in the room. What was it about the camera? Was it the infrared? The low-light sensitivity? It was something about the light, or the lack of it. It existed in that gray space between light and shadow.

So, I thought, what if I introduced a lot of light? Suddenly. Violently.

I went online and ordered the most powerful tactical flashlight I could find, and it had a disorienting strobe function, the kind police use to blind and confuse suspects. It felt insane, buying a weapon for a ghost, but it was the only thing I could think of. When it arrived, I kept it in the pocket of my scrubs at all times. It was a heavy, cold lump against my thigh, a constant reminder of the vigil I was keeping.

For two weeks, nothing happened. My grandmother’s condition stabilized, then began to slowly, inevitably, decline. I was in a constant state of low-grade terror. The exhaustion was bone-deep. My body felt like it was humming with a terrible energy. I’d doze off at the desk and jerk awake, heart pounding, convinced I’d missed it.

And then, one night, it happened.

It was 3:17 AM. The ward was as quiet as a tomb. I was staring at the monitors, my vision blurring, when I saw it. The air over my grandmother’s bed began to ripple.

It started small, a faint distortion, like a heat-haze mirage. But it grew, coalescing into that familiar, sickening, man-shaped shimmer. It was larger than I’d ever seen it before, more defined. It pulsed, a silent, ghastly vibration in the monochrome feed, and it was directly over her. I could see the image of her blankets and her sleeping form bend and warp beneath it.

A sound escaped my throat, a strangled gasp. For a second, I was frozen, my blood turning to ice water. The screen was a window into a nightmare, and the nightmare was in her room.

Then, the adrenaline hit me like a physical blow.

I didn't think. I just moved. I was out of my chair and running before I was even consciously aware of the decision. My feet pounded down the hallway, the sound echoing in the oppressive silence. I fumbled in my pocket, my fingers closing around the cold metal of the flashlight.

My thumb found the switch.

I burst through the door to her room so hard it slammed against the stopper. The room was dark, just as I knew it would be. The air was still. I couldn't see anything. My grandmother was stirring, her head turning on the pillow, disturbed by the noise.

""Who's there?"" she murmured, her voice weak.

There was no time. I raised the flashlight, aimed it at the empty space above her bed where I knew the thing was hovering, and I slammed my thumb down on the strobe button.

The world exploded into a silent, strobing cataclysm of pure white light.

The effect was instantaneous and violent. The air itself seemed to scream, though there was no sound. The creature—the Scavenger—recoiled from the light as if struck. It wasn't just that it shied away. The strobing flashes, the rapid-fire assault of light-dark-light-dark, did something to it. It forced it into a state of temporary solidity.

And for a single, soul-shattering second, I saw it.

It was faces.

Hundreds of them. A screaming, swirling, three-dimensional mosaic of human faces, all crushed together into one writhing, humanoid shape. They were pale and translucent, their features overlapping, their mouths open in silent, confused agony. They weren't just any faces. I recognized them.

I saw the retired mailman from 308, his eyes wide with a terror his dementia had never allowed. I saw the woman who had outlived her children, her face a mask of pleading confusion. I saw a man who had died of pneumonia two months prior, a woman from a stroke last winter. Face after face, patient after patient, all of them taken from this very ward. All the people whose families had called, confused and heartbroken. All the people who had died unable to recognize the ones they loved.

The faces were the creature. It was made of them. Made of what it had taken.

The strobing light hit it again, and with a final, violent contortion, it dissolved like smoke in a hurricane, and was simply… gone.

The room was plunged back into darkness, the only light the steady orange glow from the IV pump. The silence that rushed in was deafening. My own ragged breathing sounded like a roar. The flashlight slipped from my trembling hand and clattered to the floor.

""What… what in heaven's name was that?""

My grandmother’s voice. It was clear. Frightened, but clear.

I stumbled to her bedside, my legs shaking so badly I could barely stand. ""It's okay,"" I stammered, my voice cracking. ""It's okay. It was just… a bad dream.""

I reached out and took her hand. Her skin was cool and papery. She turned her head, and her eyes, clear and focused in the dim light, found mine. There was no confusion. No blur. She saw me.

She squeezed my hand weakly. ""You look so tired,"" she said, a faint smile touching her lips. ""My boy. You're here.""

I started to cry. Not quiet, dignified tears, but ugly, gulping sobs of terror and relief. I had done it. I had saved her. For now. She had looked at me, and she had seen me.

I quit my job the next day. I couldn't go back there. I couldn't sit at that desk and watch that screen, knowing what was really there. Knowing that the hospital wasn't just a place where people died, but a feeding ground.

My grandmother was discharged to my care a week later. She’s with me now, in my small apartment.

Every lamp is on, all the time. Our electricity bill is astronomical, but I don't care. There are no dark corners. I’ve bought three more of those tactical flashlights. There’s one in every room. I’ve even rigged a DJ-style strobe light in the living room, where she sleeps in a hospital bed I had delivered. I have it on a timer. Sometimes, it just goes off, flooding the room with that violent, cleansing light. It terrifies her, but it’s better than the alternative.

I don’t sleep. Not really. I doze in a chair by her bed, for an hour at a time, maybe two. I’ve set alarms on my phone to go off every forty-five minutes, jolting me awake. Every time I close my eyes, I see that collage of faces, swirling in the dark. I see what it’s made of.

I know it’s still out there. I know it’s patient. It’s waiting for me to fail. It's waiting for me to get sloppy, to get too tired. It's waiting for the moment I finally succumb to the exhaustion that is chewing away at my soul, the moment I fall into a deep, real sleep.

But I won’t let it. I won't let her last moments be spent staring into the face of her grandson and seeing nothing but a blur. She will not die alone, surrounded by strangers. When her time comes, she is going to look at me. And she is going to see my face. She is going to know that I am here.

I will be the last thing she sees. I will burn my image into her memory with every light I own. I will stand between her and that shimmering, hungry darkness. I don’t know how long I can keep this up. But I have to. Because I am her grandson, and I am here, and I will not let it have her.",1,1767472318.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I spent the time I wasn't at the monitor in her room, holding her hand. She was mostly sleeping, frail and small in the oversized hospital bed. But sometimes she’d wake up, and her eyes, clouded with pain and medication, would find mine.

""There you are,"" she'd whisper, her voice a dry rustle. And she’d smile. A real smile.

And I would think, *It won’t take this. I won’t let it.*

I needed a plan. I couldn't just watch and wait for it to appear. I had to be able to do something. The thing was only visible on the camera. It was invisible to the naked eye in the room. What was it about the camera? Was it the infrared? The low-light sensitivity? It was something about the light, or the lack of it. It existed in that gray space between light and shadow.

So, I thought, what if I introduced a lot of light? Suddenly. Violently.

I went online and ordered the most powerful tactical flashlight I could find, and it had a disorienting strobe function, the kind police use to blind and confuse suspects. It felt insane, buying a weapon for a ghost, but it was the only thing I could think of. When it arrived, I kept it in the pocket of my scrubs at all times. It was a heavy, cold lump against my thigh, a constant reminder of the vigil I was keeping.

For two weeks, nothing happened. My grandmother’s condition stabilized, then began to slowly, inevitably, decline. I was in a constant state of low-grade terror. The exhaustion was bone-deep. My body felt like it was humming with a terrible energy. I’d doze off at the desk and jerk awake, heart pounding, convinced I’d missed it.

And then, one night, it happened.

It was 3:17 AM. The ward was as quiet as a tomb. I was staring at the monitors, my vision blurring, when I saw it. The air over my grandmother’s bed began to ripple.

It started small, a faint distortion, like a heat-haze mirage. But it grew, coalescing into that familiar, sickening, man-shaped shimmer. It was larger than I’d ever seen it before, more defined. It pulsed, a silent, ghastly vibration in the monochrome feed, and it was directly over her. I could see the image of her blankets and her sleeping form bend and warp beneath it.

A sound escaped my throat, a strangled gasp. For a second, I was frozen, my blood turning to ice water. The screen was a window into a nightmare, and the nightmare was in her room.

Then, the adrenaline hit me like a physical blow.

I didn't think. I just moved. I was out of my chair and running before I was even consciously aware of the decision. My feet pounded down the hallway, the sound echoing in the oppressive silence. I fumbled in my pocket, my fingers closing around the cold metal of the flashlight.

My thumb found the switch.

I burst through the door to her room so hard it slammed against the stopper. The room was dark, just as I knew it would be. The air was still. I couldn't see anything. My grandmother was stirring, her head turning on the pillow, disturbed by the noise.

""Who's there?"" she murmured, her voice weak.

There was no time. I raised the flashlight, aimed it at the empty space above her bed where I knew the thing was hovering, and I slammed my thumb down on the strobe button.

The world exploded into a silent, strobing cataclysm of pure white light.

The effect was instantaneous and violent. The air itself seemed to scream, though there was no sound. The creature—the Scavenger—recoiled from the light as if struck. It wasn't just that it shied away. The strobing flashes, the rapid-fire assault of light-dark-light-dark, did something to it. It forced it into a state of temporary solidity.

And for a single, soul-shattering second, I saw it.

It was faces.

Hundreds of them. A screaming, swirling, three-dimensional mosaic of human faces, all crushed together into one writhing, humanoid shape. They were pale and translucent, their features overlapping, their mouths open in silent, confused agony. They weren't just any faces. I recognized them.

I saw the retired mailman from 308, his eyes wide with a terror his dementia had never allowed. I saw the woman who had outlived her children, her face a mask of pleading confusion. I saw a man who had died of pneumonia two months prior, a woman from a stroke last winter. Face after face, patient after patient, all of them taken from this very ward. All the people whose families had called, confused and heartbroken. All the people who had died unable to recognize the ones they loved.

The faces were the creature. It was made of them. Made of what it had taken.

The strobing light hit it again, and with a final, violent contortion, it dissolved like smoke in a hurricane, and was simply… gone.

The room was plunged back into darkness, the only light the steady orange glow from the IV pump. The silence that rushed in was deafening. My own ragged breathing sounded like a roar. The flashlight slipped from my trembling hand and clattered to the floor.

""What… what in heaven's name was that?""

My grandmother’s voice. It was clear. Frightened, but clear.

I stumbled to her bedside, my legs shaking so badly I could barely stand. ""It's okay,"" I stammered, my voice cracking. ""It's okay. It was just… a bad dream.""

I reached out and took her hand. Her skin was cool and papery. She turned her head, and her eyes, clear and focused in the dim light, found mine. There was no confusion. No blur. She saw me.

She squeezed my hand weakly. ""You look so tired,"" she said, a faint smile touching her lips. ""My boy. You're here.""

I started to cry. Not quiet, dignified tears, but ugly, gulping sobs of terror and relief. I had done it. I had saved her. For now. She had looked at me, and she had seen me.

I quit my job the next day. I couldn't go back there. I couldn't sit at that desk and watch that screen, knowing what was really there. Knowing that the hospital wasn't just a place where people died, but a feeding ground.

My grandmother was discharged to my care a week later. She’s with me now, in my small apartment.

Every lamp is on, all the time. Our electricity bill is astronomical, but I don't care. There are no dark corners. I’ve bought three more of those tactical flashlights. There’s one in every room. I’ve even rigged a DJ-style strobe light in the living room, where she sleeps in a hospital bed I had delivered. I have it on a timer. Sometimes, it just goes off, flooding the room with that violent, cleansing light. It terrifies her, but it’s better than the alternative.

I don’t sleep. Not really. I doze in a chair by her bed, for an hour at a time, maybe two. I’ve set alarms on my phone to go off every forty-five minutes, jolting me awake. Every time I close my eyes, I see that collage of faces, swirling in the dark. I see what it’s made of.

I know it’s still out there. I know it’s patient. It’s waiting for me to fail. It's waiting for me to get sloppy, to get too tired. It's waiting for the moment I finally succumb to the exhaustion that is chewing away at my soul, the moment I fall into a deep, real sleep.

But I won’t let it. I won't let her last moments be spent staring into the face of her grandson and seeing nothing but a blur. She will not die alone, surrounded by strangers. When her time comes, she is going to look at me. And she is going to see my face. She is going to know that I am here.

I will be the last thing she sees. I will burn my image into her memory with every light I own. I will stand between her and that shimmering, hungry darkness. I don’t know how long I can keep this up. But I have to. Because I am her grandson, and I am here, and I will not let it have her.",4,1767472283.0,stories,0,1.0,False

For some backstory :

 I went to university aged 18 to do a foundation year but just struggled mentally and also I was probably more lazy than I’d like to admit and dropped out halfway through my first year there, moved back to my brothers as my mum passed away and didn’t want to live at my dads.

I fell into the slippery slope that is hospitality and have worked on bars and as waitress but kind of gave up on the company I was working at and moved to a barista role, which I don’t mind doing I enjoy doing latte art and good coffee but, I just feel like I need to do more and somehow make more money and have a career, but I just really don’t know what I want to do, I’ve been told I’d be good at whatever I choose to do because I really do learn fast when it come to practical things but I just struggle with writing as you can probably tell.

1q359i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q359i1/my_job_is_to_watch_the_dying_i_wish_that_was_all/,My job is to watch the dying. I wish that was all I was seeing.,"I don’t know if this is a confession or a warning. Maybe it’s just a scream into the void, because I can’t scream out loud anymore. I have to be quiet. For her.

For six years, I was a night-shift nurse on a long-term geriatric ward. If you want to know what it’s like to see the human body fail in every conceivable way, slowly and without fanfare, that’s the job for you. It’s not like the ER, all flashing lights and adrenaline. It’s the opposite. It’s the slow, quiet dimming of a bulb. My job, as I saw it, was to manage the dimming. To make sure the fuses didn’t blow too spectacularly on the way out. Change the sheets, administer the meds, chart the decline. It sounds cold, I know. But after a few years, you have to build a wall. You see so much loss, so much slow-motion decay, that if you let it all in, you’d drown. My wall was made of cynicism and exhaustion.

The nights are the worst. The ward takes on a different character after midnight. The daytime bustle of family visits and physical therapists is gone, replaced by a profound, humming silence, punctuated by the rhythmic sigh of a ventilator or the lonely beep of a heart monitor. The air gets thick with the smell of antiseptic and something older, something like dust and regret. My world shrank to the nurses' station, a small island of harsh fluorescent light in an ocean of darkened rooms. My main companion was the bank of security monitors.

They were old, cheap things. The feed was grainy, black and white, with a low frame rate that made everything look jerky and unreal. I’d watch the screens, my eyes tracing the vague, sleeping shapes in the beds, making sure no one was trying to climb out of their rails, no one was in distress. It was mostly a form of meditation, a way to pass the hours until the sun came up and I could go home to my own quiet, empty apartment.

That’s when I first started seeing it.

It wasn't something you'd notice right away. I didn’t. For weeks, maybe months, I probably saw it and my brain just edited it out, filed it under ‘bad reception’ or ‘light flare’. It looked, for lack of a better word, like heat. A shimmer. The kind you see rising off asphalt on a blistering summer day. A distortion in the air, a patch of reality that seemed to be vibrating at a different frequency.

It only ever appeared on the monitors. And it only ever appeared in one place: hovering directly over a patient’s bed.

The first time I clearly registered it was with a man in Room 308. He was a retired mailman, ninety-something, his mind long gone to dementia but his body stubbornly clinging on. I glanced at the monitor for his room and saw it – a wavering, vaguely man-shaped column of static and haze hanging over his bed. It had no features, no color, just this intense, silent vibration that made the grainy image of the man beneath it seem to warp and bend.

My first thought was a technical issue. A short in the camera, maybe. I got up, stretched, and walked down the hall to his room. The corridor was silent except for the squeak of my own rubber-soled shoes. I pushed the door open gently. The room was still, cool. The only light was the faint orange glow from his IV pump. The air was perfectly clear. The man was sleeping, his breath a shallow, rattling thing. Nothing was there. I checked his vitals, adjusted his blanket, and went back to the nurses' station.

On the monitor, the shimmer was gone.

Three hours later, at the end of my shift, the man in 308 passed away.

We called the family. The day shift handled the body. I went home, slept, and didn’t think much of it. Coincidence.

A week later, it happened again. Room 312. A woman who had outlived all three of her children. On the monitor, I saw the same heat-haze, the same silent, shimmering distortion hanging over her frail form. This time, I didn't hesitate. I walked straight down there. Again, the room was still and empty. The air was clear. I stood there for a full minute, just listening to her ragged breathing, feeling the hairs on my arms stand up for no reason I could name. I went back to the desk. The shimmer was gone from the screen. She was gone by morning.

This time, I was there when her daughter called. I picked up the phone. She was sobbing, but there was something else in her voice, too. Confusion.

""I don't understand,"" she said, her voice thick with grief. ""I was just with her yesterday afternoon. She was lucid, you know? For a minute. She was holding my hand.""

""I'm so sorry for your loss,"" I said, the standard line.

""But she... she kept squinting at me,"" the daughter continued, her voice trembling. ""She asked me who I was. She said... she said she couldn't see my face. Just a blur. She sounded so scared.""

I gave her the hospital's other standard line. The one we gave when the dying brain started to misfire. ""It's a common phenomenon,"" I said, my voice sounding hollow even to myself. ""In the final stages, the brain can have difficulty processing visual information. It's just a part of the process, a symptom of the body shutting down.""

She accepted it, of course. What else could she do? But her words stuck with me. *She said she couldn't see my face.*

The pattern started to become undeniable. A few weeks would pass, then I’d see the shimmer on the monitor in a patient’s room. I’d go to check, find nothing, and within a day, that patient would be gone. And then, like clockwork, the phone calls. Always the same story, with slight variations.

""My son flew in all the way from the coast,"" one man told me, his voice choked. ""His mother looked right through him. Asked him why a stranger was crying in her room.""

""She was terrified,"" a young woman whispered over the phone. ""She kept saying, 'Your voice is so familiar, but I don't know you. Where are your eyes?'""

*He couldn't see me.*

*She didn't know who I was.*

*Just a blur.*

Every time, we’d give the official explanation. Hypoxia. Terminal agitation. Brain function decline. And every time, I felt a cold knot tighten in my stomach. Because I knew. I knew it wasn't a symptom of dying.  The shimmer on the screen, this heat-haze creature… it was doing something. It was there, and then they were gone, and the last thing they experienced was the face of their loved one dissolving into a meaningless abstraction.

I tried to tell someone once. A senior nurse I respected. I phrased it carefully, talking about the camera glitches and the strange coincidence of the family reports. She just gave me a tired look and told me to take a few days off. ""This place gets to you,"" she'd said, patting my arm. ""You're seeing ghosts in the machine. Get some sleep.""

So I kept it to myself. I started calling it the Scavenger in my head. It felt right. It wasn't killing them; they were already dying. It was just… feeding on something on its way out. Something from the wreckage. I became a connoisseur of the low-resolution feed from our ancient security system. I learned to distinguish the shimmer from a dust mote floating in front of the lens, or a trick of the low light. It was an organic, pulsing thing, and seeing it on the screen made my blood run cold. My cynicism, my carefully constructed wall, began to crumble. I was a witness.

And then my grandmother fell.

She was the one who raised me. My rock. My entire family history condensed into one stubborn, fiercely loving woman who smelled of cinnamon and old books. She broke her hip. A simple fall, but at her age, a simple fall is a death sentence delivered by gravity. The surgery went as well as it could, but the recovery was brutal. Infections. Complications. Delirium. One day, she was in the main hospital, the next, they were transferring her. To my ward.

My world tilted on its axis. The place I had managed to emotionally wall myself off from, the place that was just a job, suddenly became the most terrifying place on Earth. Because now, the Scavenger wasn't just some abstract horror I observed from a distance. It was hunting in my home.

I pulled every string I could, took on every extra shift. I basically lived at the hospital. My colleagues thought I was being the devoted grandson. They had no idea I was standing guard. My life became a ritual of fear. I’d do my rounds, dispensing medication, changing dressings, all with a knot of dread in my gut. And then I’d sit at the nurses' station, my eyes glued to one monitor in particular. The small, grainy, black-and-white window into my grandmother’s room.

Every flicker of the screen, every shadow, sent a jolt of panic through me. I saw the Scavenger everywhere. In the reflection on the linoleum floor. In the steam rising from a cup of coffee. I was unraveling. The other nurses started giving me wide berth. I was jumpy, irritable, my eyes wide and bloodshot from lack of sleep and an overdose of caffeine.

I spent the time I wasn't at the monitor in her room, holding her hand. She was mostly sleeping, frail and small in the oversized hospital bed. But sometimes she’d wake up, and her eyes, clouded with pain and medication, would find mine.

""There you are,"" she'd whisper, her voice a dry rustle. And she’d smile. A real smile.

1q3597v,https://i.redd.it/p66sqz5e27bg1.jpeg,The Portuguese Breakfast (at a local pastry café),"

In my opinion, every trip should start with a proper breakfast. And if you want to try a typical Portuguese pastry café (what we call a “pastelaria”), it helps to know what to order.

Of course, these days there’s more variety and people are more health-conscious,  but these are the classics you’ll still see every morning:

Portuguese croissant with ham and cheese, softer and sweeter than the French version, usually filled with ham and cheese.

 Pão de Deus, a sweet coconut-topped bun, often with ham and cheese too.

Simple bread roll, for a more basic ham and cheese sandwich.

 Tosta mista, buttered toast with melted cheese and ham. Crispy, warm, and perfect with a coffee.

Torrada , thick slices of toasted bread generously buttered, usually served cut into strips. A breakfast staple, especially with a hot drink.

 And when it comes to drinks…these are the most common options:

Café (a short espresso)

Galão (served in a tall glass — mostly milk with a shot of coffee)

Meia de leite (half milk, half coffee, in a cup)

Abatanado (a long espresso, similar to an Americano)


🍊 Fresh orange juice is also a very typical choice.

And of course... if there’s still space, there’s always a pastel de nata nearby.

I just joined this subreddit, and this is my first time posting here! Nice to meet you all.



I just acquired a Gaggia Classic E24 and a Eureka Mignon Specialita. I was very excited to unbox them and dial them in yesterday, and it took me almost a whole bag of beans, but at the end, I thought I had nailed the dial-in process. I was able to achieve 16 grams in and 32 grams out right at around 27 seconds for a double shot. I tried to get 18 grams of coffee in the double-shot basket, but the ground was too fluffy and would not fit in the basket, which was why I ended up going with 16 grams.



This morning, I woke up and decided to pull myself an espresso shot. With all the settings untouched, the ground was suddenly too fine and there was barely any coffee dripping out of the portafilter. I felt very disheartened and frustrated, because I felt like I had just wasted so much coffee and squandered an entire afternoon for nothing.



Here is some detailed information of my setup:

Beans: San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser

Water: Filtered tap water

Grinder: Eureka Mignon Specialita w/ stock bean hopper (16 grams out with 10.1 seconds)

Espresso Machine: Gaggia Classic E24 w/ stock portafilter and double-shot basket

Tamper: Normcore Spring Loaded Tamper V4

Others: Normcore WDT, Normcore Distributor, Normcore Tamping Station



Any help is appreciated, and I am willing to modify my setup and get better beans if the those are the cause.

I recently moved to Zurich for a new job and I’m looking to meet like-minded people. I’m a 29-year-old female software engineer with a strong interest in philosophy, psychology, history, and science.

I enjoy thinking about both big existential questions and everyday human behavior. Coming from a South Asian background (Pakistan), I’ve been exposed to both Eastern and Western cultures and philosophies, which has shaped how I see the world.

If you enjoy thoughtful conversations, observing life a bit too closely, or talking about books (bonus points if it’s not *Twilight* 😄), I’d love to grab a coffee sometime.

I'm sorry, but this might be a long one.

I'm currently going through an extremely difficult time, both for myself and, of course, for my family.

I've been experiencing an unbearable crisis for several months now, and I spend my days trying to figure out how to kill myself.

I envy those who have this condition and say, ""I quit coffee and I'm cured."" Actually, no. I'm not envious, I'm angry. And I think it's unfair. It's selfish of me, but I'm so desperate.

I'll try to be as specific as possible about my symptoms.

I don't experience any pain. But the urgency and frequency are extreme.
I feel like my entire pelvic floor is inflamed. I have a constant urge 24/7. Never a break. Zero. None.
I have constant urgency, so I spend my days holding my bladder as much as possible and I urinate when I feel it's going to Explode.

I'm afraid my bladder is atrophic or shrinking. I feel like most of my discomfort is coming from the bottom of my bladder; I'm thinking it's the trigone.

I'm seeing a urologist in three weeks.

I'm this close to giving up, swallowing a box of pills, and leaving this world.

I'm sorry if this post is so depressing, but I can't pretend, and I have no one to confide in.

1q34y1k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q34y1k,"Thrush, Candida, halitosis, bacterial biofilm or what? I have given up. Please help me, it's been 10 years now.","I don’t remember the exact start date, but I’ve had this problem for at least 10 years. I’m a 27-year-old male. I have a persistent white coating on my tongue and a strong, foul mouth odour. I believe this is caused by some kind of fungal, yeast, or bacterial biofilm in my mouth or also in my body or gut.

I’ve researched everything about oral thrush, candida, and bacterial biofilm. I reckon it's candida, but I don’t have any of the typical symptoms besides a very foul shit-like smell from my mouth for years. I’m very healthy. I function normally, exercise, eat clean, and don’t eat junk food. I have no other health problems besides extreme shit like smell that comes from my mouth. It’s extremely distressing and has affected my life for years. At its worst, even brushing my teeth and tongue didn’t help, and the smell is still there immediately after brushing.

I’ve learned how to manage it slightly over time by food and self-analysis, sugars, milk and dairy, cheese, and coffee, white flour, wheat, rice, as well as I reckon makes this worse. but it never fully goes away before, until recently I’ve had two oral swab tests(one recently), and both came back negative for oral thrush candida. Last month, I started taking nystatin for about 3 months, and 80-90% smell went away, but the white tongue was still there. Then I switched to micanozole and used that for about 3 weeks more, since I knew that my condition is very old, so to be on the safe side, also used micanozole. It helped with smell and white coating at the begining but then white tongue came back again. However, some days I again felt a foul smell from my mouth while I was on the last phase of using Micanozole. Currently, I'm not taking any anti-fungals, and I think smell has improved upto 90%. But I'm scared and feel that slowly the smell is coming back(some days I feel smell, some days I don't at all). And for the last two months, I took a very strict antifungal diet with antifungal medications. I had only eggs and meat thats all, and some herbal treatments like cinnamon paper, oregano oil, clove water, lime. Also, when I had severe white coating and a smell in my mouth, I also saw trichbacteriosis under my armpits and testicular hairs.

Whenever I used to have a severe smell from my mouth, I also felt a bitter sensation in my mouth. And even now, I feel a bitter sensation after antifungals. And when I feel this smell also comes, especially at that time.

What u all think it is, why my tongue keep getting white now? Even with a very strong diet? And even when I was tested negative for thrush, then how did anti-fungals cure my condition? What to do as now smells coming back again? or it come back fully as it was before? I did feel that I had cured it, but it's coming back, which is making me stressed again.

Heres what I learned.



In June 1994 I quit my $700 a week construction job with a pregnant wife, one kid, and $3,200 to my name. Bought a used window van for $2,000. Had basic tools. Zero customers.



First day out I knocked on doors in Ridgewood NJ. Handed out business cards at coffee shops. Offered free system evaluations.



Got a call. Ladys compressor was dead. Hot summer day. I quoted $1,875. She said yes. I installed it that afternoon. That was almost 3 weeks pay from my old job. In one day. She stayed a customer for 18 years until she passed away in 2012.



Fast forward 24 years. Grew from solo operation to 5 employees. Built a 10 year guarantee system that locked in recurring revenue. 80% of business came from referrals by year 10. Sold in 2018 and retired with multiple properties paid off and zero debt.



I worked my ass off. 6am to 9pm 7 days a week in year 1. Almost quit in month 3 when money was tight and my wife was giving me the look. But I figured out a few things that changed everything.



How to close deals without being a pushy salesman. How to handle ""youre $2,000 higher than the other guy"". How to use a 10 year guarantee as a competitive moat. How to get building departments to quietly refer customers to you. Which customers to walk away from.

1q34w1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q34w1e/what_are_the_types_of_smart_plugs_available/,What are the types of smart plugs available?,"Smart plugs have become one of the easiest ways to make your home smarter without breaking the bank. If you're thinking about getting some, you'll want to know what types are out there and which ones might work best for your needs.

**Basic Wi-Fi Smart Plugs**

These are the most common smart plugs you'll find. They connect directly to your home Wi-Fi network and let you control any device through your smartphone. You can turn lights on and off, start your coffee maker before you get out of bed, or make sure you didn't leave the iron on. Most of these work with Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice assistants.

**Outdoor Smart Plugs**

If you want to control things outside your house, outdoor smart plugs are weather-resistant and built to handle rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. They're perfect for holiday lights, pool pumps, or garden equipment. These smart plugs usually have a tougher design and special sealing to keep moisture out.

**Multi-Outlet Smart Plugs**

Instead of just one outlet, these smart plugs give you multiple outlets that you can control separately. You might turn on your desk lamp but keep your printer off. They're great for entertainment centers where you have lots of devices plugged in.

**Smart Plug Strips**

These work like regular power strips but with smart features. Each outlet can be controlled individually, and many come with USB ports too. They're handy for offices or anywhere you need multiple smart outlets in one spot.

**Energy Monitoring Smart Plugs**

These smart plugs do more than just turn things on and off - they track how much electricity your devices use. You can see which appliances cost you the most money and find ways to save on your electric bill.

When you're ready to start building your smart home setup, you can check out different options at [athomewave.com/smart-plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs). The key is picking smart plugs that work with your existing devices and home setup.

**Things to Consider**

Before buying, think about what you want to control. Do you need scheduling features? Voice control? App notifications? Most smart plugs offer basic remote control, but some have advanced features like away mode that makes it look like someone's home when you're traveling.

Also check if the smart plugs work with your smart home system. Most work with popular platforms, but it's worth double-checking before you buy.

Smart plugs are one of the cheapest ways to dip your toes into home automation. You can find quality options for different needs at [athomewave.com/smart-plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) and start making your home smarter today.

The best part? You don't need any special wiring or technical skills. Just plug them in, download an app, and you're ready to go.",1,1767471377.0,ProductNew,0,1.0,False
