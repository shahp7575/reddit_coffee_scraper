by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanwha Eagles vs. Kia Tigers: A Tale of Two Batting Averages (and One Very Tired Pitcher)**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your peanuts and prepare for a game where the Hanwha Eagles are favored to win like a veteran’s first-base coach on a Monday morning—*relentlessly, predictably, and with the energy of a man who’s seen your worst swing and still believes in you*.

### Parsing the Odds: Math, Mayhem, and Mild Midlife Crises

The numbers scream “Hanwha party!” with implied probabilities hovering around **62.5%** for the Eagles (decimal odds of 1.53) and a paltry **27%** for the Tigers. The spread (-1.5 for Hanwha) suggests this won’t be a nail-biter unless someone invents a way to turn a 3.30 ERA into a 6.44 ERA mid-game. The total runs line sits at **8.0**, with slightly better value on the over (1.85-1.87 odds) than the under. Why? Because Ryu Hyun-jin, Hanwha’s lefty ace, has a 3.30 ERA, while Kia’s Kim Geon-guk looks like he’s pitching for the *KBO version of a coffee stain* (6.44 ERA).

### News Digest: An Chi-hong’s Resurgence and the Tigers’ Existential Crisis

Let’s start with Hanwha’s hero, An Chi-hong. The veteran first baseman is having a *“I’m here, I’m alive, and I just hit a 115-meter moonshot”* moment. Last game, he went 4-for-4 with 3 RBIs, proving that even a .167 batting average can feel like a .500 slugfest when the stars align. His 2025 stats? *Charming.* A .167 average is like a slow elevator in a two-story building—there’s not much tension. But here’s the twist: Hanwha’s manager, Kim Kyung-moon, trusts him to lead off like he’s narrating a TED Talk on *“How to Swing a Bat Without Tripping Over Your Shoelaces.”*

On the Tigers’ side, their pitcher Kim Geon-guk has an ERA that

1nj1kmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nj1kmb/my_ex_is_joining_my_work_project_after_a_year_of/,"My ex is joining my work project, after a year of not seeing each other.... And I don't know how to act","Hello everyone!

First of all I would like to say that I love you Charlotte! Your videos always keep me company while I'm getting work done and I always giggle listening to your stories.

Please pardon any weird mistakes in my post, english is not my first language, and this is my ever first Reddit post :)

On to the story.

I (34 F) have been working on my current industry for about a decade and I have worked my way up over the years, achieving to finally get my dream job this year after many major projects. My job is not a normal 9 to 5, I work on a kind of industry that has short period projects (about a month or so, per project) and we work on this endless race of starting a job, executing, wrapping and then doing it all over again. I really love it and this has given me the oportunity of meeting all kinds of people and places.

A few years ago, on one of this jobs, I meet a man (let's call him Logan 43 M) who was a vendor for us. I was still in a lower work position and I started to work with him (paperwork, contracts and stuff) and we hit it off. I always thought he was cool, but nothing more. The years went by and we continued to collaborate, and as I rose within my company, we started having more contact, since my job required to have deeper communication with the vendors, and at that point, he was beccoming one of my main and must trusted vendors for very specific needs, including high risk projects. He was kind of the action guy I would call when I saw something risking popping on the horizon.

As time went by we became friends, following each other in social media and casually chatting over our jobs together. He also, became flirthy with me, to the point of actually asking me out for coffee and openly saying he was attracted to me. At the time of this I was on a long term relationship that was rapidly crumbling. Although I was not happy on my relationship, I was not the kind of person to vent about this matters with almost anyone, so when he asked me out I flat out told him I would not be going out for coffee or for anything else with him, as I had a boyfriend.

He, being straight forward as always, asked if I was bothered by him flirthing with me. I said, honestly no. I told him I was not indifferent to him either, but as long as I was on a relationship, I would not be engaging with him in anything more than the friendship we had already built based on our jobs and mutual interests. We agreed to keep things as they were, and he playfully told me that he would keep flirthing as long as I wasn't anoyed by that.

Time kept passing, and I inevitably broke up with my boyfriend. It was a long time coming, so I was upset, but also glad I had finally ended the relationship with a man that was just not right for me.

And so it all began. Shortly after my breakup, Logan and I started talking more and more. He shamelessly flirthed with me everytime we met, and even some of my friends/collegues would ask me what was going on cause they noticed how much Logan would follow me around, call me, chat with me, get me coffee, etc. Eventually we started seeing each other outside of the work place, and I felt I was on a real life fairy tale. He was everything I had always wanted on a man, or at least I thought so at the time.

We were dinamite together. I fell head over heels for him and we dated for about 6 - 7 months. We were getting to know each other, not like formally boyfriend girlfriend relationship, but we would hang out almost everyday, stay at each others house, our close friends knew we were dating and we even went on vacation together. I was in love and I was sure to show him how happy he made me.

Well, in the end it all went to shit. After almost 7 months dating, I started to feel a little uneasy, feeling that he was not very onboard on making the relationship ""official"". It's not like I was asking for marriage and kids. No. I just wanted us to have a conversation and be able to recognize that this was now a relationship. He was my partner and I was his, regardless of the fact that we didn't live together or planned to change any of the logistics of our current days. I just wanted to know I mattered to him, as much as he did to me.

Long story short, turns out he was not ready for that. A lot of past trauma, toxic ex wife, avoidant mother, trauma from childhood and whatnot. A lot happened, but that was the breaking point. We broke up, and I was absolutely crushed.

I actually started therapy after the breakup cause I physically felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest after losing him. It was a very rough time, but with the help of my friends, therapy and my lady balls I managed to pull myself out that very dark place where I had fallen.

It's been about a year and a half since we broke up, and next month it will be a year since the last time I saw or spoke to him.

I think it's important to add that after the break up (like two months after) I was involved in a major accident which resulted in surgery, a long hospital stay, 3 months of not being able to walk and over a year of physical therapy and more therapy to tackle the PTSD that I was left with. 

The day I crashed, I was pulled to the sidewalk (since I couldn't stand) and a good samaritan called the police for help. When asked who they could call for me, I gave them Logan's number and, I kid you not, the man crossed the city in less than 15 minutes (during peak hour), held me on the ground and when he realized the ambulance had not arrived, he picked me up and took me to the hospital himself.

For this, I will forever be greatful to him.

So after all this context.... and after a year of not seeing or talking to him, turns out my feared moment of meeting him again has come. I am currently working on a new job that will force me to work with him  (although I did try to push back on his participation) and I am not sure on how to act on this.

One part of me is nervous and a little excited to see him again after all this time. The other is hurt by the idea of facing someone that broke my heart into a million pieces and wishes I could just ignore him and preteng he doesn't even exist. But the reality is that now my actions on the work place are more on display than before, since I now lead my own team, and I feel the preasure to act profesionally and be civil with him. I also add in the fact that I do not wish to be rude to him.... I feel that if I were rude, this would only show that I still have not fully procesed the grieve of this past relationship and even worst, this would be a horrible thing of me to do to someone who, when I was in need, dropped everything to rush to my aid, no questions asked.

Basically I think that perhaps, I am not as ""over the situation"" as I though, and perhaps I still harbor feelings for him, but I do not want, nor can I allow, my feelings to take over while this is a major project for my company and I will be under the scope on every step.

So, nice people of Reddit. What would you do? Any advice would be welcome. I just don't want to act like a bitch to him (he doesnt deserve it) nor do I want to give him the impression that I wish to be friends again. I only wish I could have further pushed for him to be dismissed of the job all together and that way I could just keep away from him.

1nj1kbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nj1kbk/the_bodies_screamed_when_we_brought_them_back/,The bodies screamed when we brought them back.,"Each time we brought the recently deceased back from the dead, they screamed. We didn’t know why. The studies and preparation made sense in theory, and yet, they screamed. Every time we injected the serum into a cadaver, it would awaken violently, thrashing if it hadn’t been strapped down, and scream until it expired.

I worked at a facility, one that specialised in the study of prolonged longevity, death, and the possible resurrection of dead tissue. We had developed a new compound that appeared capable of repairing and regenerating damaged cells back to full vitality. All our tests on animals showed miraculous results: lifespans extended by years, and in several cases, subjects were brought back from recent death. One rabbit, who came to us at the age of twelve, lived for another ten years within the lab.

Once we were satisfied with the results, we began discussing human testing. Before moving on to live subjects, we wanted to see if we could bring back the recently deceased. We submitted the necessary requests for cadavers and, after navigating a mess of paperwork and red tape, established a steady stream of bodies kept on ice. The individuals sent to us had died from known diseases and had been marked for scientific use. We tried to ensure that the brain had not fully degraded, so we required the bodies to be no more than a few days, at most a week, post-mortem.

The first test was catastrophic.

Generally, when we applied the serum to animals, the body would convulse slightly and, as if waking from sleep, the creature would open its eyes and look at us. One dog we tested even wagged its tail in excitement at the sight of us. But for the first human subject, excitement was the last thing on its mind.

We laid the male subject out on a table, modesty underwear placed on them for decency. Once prepared, we injected the compound at the base of the skull and waited, usually thirty seconds to a minute, for the serum to begin rebuilding neural tissue. Our theory suggested we’d awaken a conscious person, albeit brain-dead. Our hope was to see them fully restored.

Both were wrong.

The subject tensed its entire body before a wave of movement flowed from the neck, down the arms, and through to the feet—as if, in one smooth motion, the ‘soul’ had slid back into its flesh. The hands gripped the sides of the table, the head twitched, every muscle fibre firing in chaotic, distorted spasms. His heartbeat began to pulse on our equipment, sending freshly created blood through the body. We watched in stunned amazement as the body took a long, deep breath. We smiled at the results, we did it.

Suddenly it lurched forward, its upper half snapping upright like a sprung trap. Its face contorted, mouth gaping wide, eyes bulging from their sockets, nostrils flared.

Then the screaming began.

It was a distorted scream, not unearthly, though it could be described as such. But that was only because the sound destroyed its own vocal cords and oesophagus under the sheer strain of what it was trying to emit. It was the sound of an animal, fighting with every fibre of its being to escape. The scream filled the small room, reverberating through the glassware, tearing through me, and likely everyone present.

It peaked as the body began to shake violently, its hands clawing at its own flesh, as if something unseen had gripped it from the inside. The legs trembled with frenetic energy, as if they were desperate to run, before twisting violently to one side. A sickening crack signalled the snapping of the hip.

The body collapsed, falling from the table, its head striking the cold floor with a wet smack. The screaming dragged on for another five frail seconds, then stopped with a final, broken whimper. Revitalised blood began to pool from the fractured skull, the leg bent at an unnatural angle. The noise that had escaped from that corpse felt like something being burned alive, or torn apart. Not that I know what those things sound like… but I imagine that would be the closest approximation.

I wanted to end the tests there and then. But the others insisted, we’d had a breakthrough, and we had to see it completed.

With the second subject, we took no risks. He was strapped tightly to the bench before we began. Another male, mid-forties, dead from a heart attack. My own body tensed in anticipation of what was to come. The injection was administered and, much like the first, the body responded with small, twitching bursts of energy before the spasms began. Bound at the limbs and forehead, its movements were restricted, but not silenced.

No amount of hearing protection could shield us from the guttural growls and screams that forced their way out of the subject’s throat. The entire table rattled beneath him, restraints tightening and tearing deep into the flesh as freshly reanimated blood began to leak from the wounds. Between each shriek and convulsion, the mouth snapped open and shut violently until the tongue was chewed and torn apart. The subject choked on his own blood less than a minute after revival.

We had been instructed to intervene only if the subject could be reasonably calmed. If they expired again, the company would simply supply more bodies, and more funding.

It didn’t matter, the sex, the race, the build, the age, the health before death, or how they died.

They all came back screaming.

After staggering through weeks of what could only be described as unholy experiments, we began testing different methods to sedate and prolong the bodies post-reanimation. One attempt stood out, we purposely severed the vocal cords of a cadaver before revival, hoping to silence the inevitable screaming.

She was a woman, middle-aged, and already pale from death. When she awoke, there were tears already welling in her eyes, as if her mind remembered something her body hadn’t yet caught up with. Her breathing came fast and shallow, accelerating into panicked, rasping sobs, wet, desperate gulps of air like someone drowning in the open.

Though she couldn’t scream, the sounds she made were worse. Muffled cries slipped from her ruined throat, each one a garbled echo of agony that sent shivers through every person in the room. The moans of pain, of disbelief. Grief. Recognition.

Her eyes darted wildly, bloodshot and filled with terror, locking onto each of us in turn as if begging for help or mercy, perhaps both. She tried to lift her arms, but the restraints held her down. Instead, she writhed, shuddering uncontrollably, her body convulsing in silent torment. The tears flowed freely now, tracking down her cheeks in trembling rivulets.

We had silenced her voice, but we hadn’t silenced the pain. If anything, it made it worse, watching her suffer without the outlet to scream. The room was filled with the sound of breath and whimpers, and something else: a low, involuntary whine that came not from her, but from one of the assistants, curled slightly in the corner, unable to look.

We disposed of the subject humanely.

The effect on the staff was undeniable. Conversations shortened, small talk faded, and laughter disappeared entirely. The jokes we once shared over coffee about playing God felt horrific, even dangerous to say aloud. Soon, silence became our default. We spoke only when necessary, and only about work. Every day we showed up, ran the tests, documented the results, and went home. No one asked questions.

The sense of camaraderie we’d built during the animal trials dissolved. The feeling of triumph, of being on the cusp of something extraordinary, turned to quiet dread. The resignations came quietly, one by one. No formal farewells, just an empty desk the next morning. Their replacements arrived with wide eyes and excitement, but that never lasted long.

Due to the confidentiality clauses in our contracts, I wasn’t allowed to contact any of them after they left. I never found out what happened to most of them. But I do remember one clearly. James. A close friend of mine. He was quiet in his final weeks at work, barely spoke, barely ate. Then one day, he didn’t come in. Then I saw the news. He had jumped from the top of his apartment building.

I thought about quitting. I really did. But the raise they gave me was too good to leave.

Our results were yielding nothing. Every subject we brought back either screamed, wailed, or violently thrashed before eventually expiring, or being put down.

With permissions, we began to explore the unconventional. We dabbled in pseudoscience and religious dogmata, anything that might offer an answer science could not.

The people we brought in were paid obscene amounts and sworn to absolute secrecy. Toward the end, even threats were issued. One hypnotist, an odd woman with steady hands and tired eyes, was brought in to help calm the subjects. Her role was to attempt to induce a calm state as we gradually reanimated, stimulating isolated regions of the brain one at a time while keeping the rest dormant.

For a while, it seemed promising. We ran countless sessions, and on one occasion, after several attempts and enough sedatives to drop an elephant, a subject stirred gently under hypnosis.

There was a breath, a shallow, ragged gasp of pained air squeezed through clenched teeth.

Then a single word.

“Why?”

It was faint. Barely audible. A tremble of soul-deep confusion and grief.

And then, the screaming returned, more feral and violent than before. The subject convulsed so hard the restraints tore deep into the flesh. The hypnotist never returned after that session. She didn’t even collect her final pay.

After her, we were truly desperate. We brought in a priest, an ageing man with a cautious demeanour, willing to participate in hopes of finding some sort of answer. None of us were superstitious, but something in the screaming had begun to strip away our rationality, our sense of detachment. It felt as though each reanimation peeled back another layer of our humanity, leaving something hollow and shaking beneath.

The priest performed a full exorcism over the cadaver as it reanimated. He held a crucifix above its chest and muttered Latin gospels with trembling conviction. Strangely, the body responded. It strained violently against the restraints, muscles taut as steel cords, but it didn’t scream. Not at first.

The priest’s words seemed to still it, but only for a moment. Then the corpse snapped upright with terrifying force, tearing free of the table as metal bolts ripped from the floor. It lunged, flailing wildly. The priest stumbled back, narrowly avoiding a crushing blow to the head, and managed to escape with no significant injury.

What followed was not panic, but fury. He shouted at us, eyes wild, accusing us of blasphemy. “You’re dragging sinners from hell,” he screamed. “You’re summoning torment, not salvation!” His voice cracked as he ranted and raved, his tone eerily echoing the corpses we’d brought back. Then he left, stormed out of the facility, never to return.

From that point on, armed guards were stationed in every session. Not that it mattered. The sessions didn’t last long after that anyway.

For one final try, one more attempt to gain any understanding, we turned away from the mystical and into even more eccentric science. We selected an elderly subject, late 90s, died of natural causes. A quiet death, with no visible trauma. We surgically detached his spinal column from the base of the brain, severing all motor function. The body was essentially quadraplegic, incapable of movement or speech. Only the essential organ connections were maintained.

Then, we installed a neural interface, an experimental chip connected directly to the brainstem and visual cortex, linked to a computer in the adjacent observation room. It was programmed to interpret neural signals and convert them into written text.

Only a few of us remained by this point. We sat in silence behind the thick glass, monitors glowing faintly in the dim observation room. The only other person present inside the subjects room was the armed guard, now a permanent fixture, with orders to terminate the subject immediately if necessary.

We administered the injection and waited.

There were no spasms, no strained limbs, no hideous sounds of vocal cords tearing. Just the soft, rhythmic beep of a heart restarting and the subtle rise and fall of a chest drawing breath. The room was so silent, it felt as though the screams of the previous cadavers echoed from memory into the still air.

Then the text flashed on screen:

‘Where am I?’

We froze.

Even though it was only text, something in my mind gave it life. I heard the voice behind it. An old man. Tired. Confused.

We typed back.

‘Who are you?’

‘John Forrester. Who are you?’

‘We’re here to help, John. How old are you?’

‘Ninety-six. Who are you?’

The information matched. We were finally getting somewhere.

Then the next message appeared:

‘Are you him?’

We paused.

‘Who?’

There was a long silence.

Then:

‘You’re not him. No, no no.’

John’s heart rate began to climb. The breathing grew rapid. His test flashed again.

‘You’re not supposed to know.’

We stared at the screen, unsure how to respond. My assistant looked at me, her mouth slightly open, but I said nothing.

‘You’re not supposed to know.’ He repeated.

I looked through the window.

John’s eyes were open.

Wide. Wet. Unblinking.

Tears streamed down his cheeks, pooling on the slab beneath. It shouldn’t have been possible.

‘He won’t let me back. You’re not supposed to know.’

The cursor blinked.

I turned to the screen again, only to see another message.

‘He won’t let you.’

Pause.

‘He won’t let you.’

Again.

And again.

And again.

My heart thudded painfully in my chest, matching the BPM displayed on the monitor. My breathing grew shallow. Then I heard something.

Not in my mind.

Real sound.

I looked up.

John’s mouth was moving.

Impossible. His nerves were severed.

His lips parted wider. Sound emerged, quiet at first, but real. Tangible.

“He won’t let you…”

I froze. I shouldn’t be able to hear it through the glass but I heard it. The guard looked to me for the termination signal.

I shook my head. Not yet.

“He won’t let you…”

The whisper grew in volume, ragged and forced from a throat that should’ve been silent.

“He won’t let you! He won’t let you! He won’t let you! He won’t let you! He won’t let you! HE WON’T LET YOU!”

The gunshot was final.

The sound rang out across the lab like a gavel striking the lid of a coffin. John’s body slumped against the slab, what remained of his expression frozen in wide-eyed agony. The guard, shaking, holstered his weapon and left the room without a word.

The silence that followed was suffocating.

I collapsed back into my chair. My ears rang, not from the shot, but from the absence of everything else. No monitors, no voices, no screams.

Just silence.

I didn’t know what to report. I didn’t know what I just witnessed.

The project was terminated soon after, officially deemed a dead end. We were compensated generously, bonuses, severance, hush clauses buried in legalese. More than enough to vanish, to start over, to never work again.

But money does nothing for the silence.

I sit here now, alone, typing these words. Surrounded by a silence so heavy it feels alive. Suffocating. Endless. To fill that silence, my mind conjures John’s voice, Lingering on his words.

I now wish for the screaming instead.

Rent, utilities, Wi-Fi, random Target runs, even just setting up a basic dorm room, it all stacks up like a whole extra class on top of the actual classes.

Back home I saw relatives get buried in credit card debt, so I’ve always been cautious. Now I’m here trying to keep track of coffees, snacks between lectures, textbooks that cost way more than I expected, groceries, and a Pepco bill I didn’t even think about when planning. Living on my own is giving me the independence I wanted, but my budget already feels stretched thin.

I’m trying to stick to a budget and I know building credit matters, but I really don’t want to dig myself into a hole before freshman year is even over. A couple people mentioned debit cards that build credit, where you’re only spending what you already have but it still reports to the bureaus. That honestly sounds more my speed while I’m still figuring this out. Has anyone here actually used one? Did it help your score? Any hidden fees or downsides I should watch out for?

Also looking for local tips. Best ways Terps keep utilities down once it gets colder? Any internet options in College Park that don’t suck but also aren’t overpriced? For groceries do most people lean Lidl, Aldi, or Giant? And what’s the move for textbooks besides McKeldin or Amazon?

Right now I’m mostly walking, taking the Shuttle UM, cooking more instead of always hitting Route 1 spots, and trying to give myself a weekly cap for “fun” money so I don’t burn through cash too quickly. Would love to hear what’s worked for other people here.

1nj1hol,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1nj1hol/would_you_casually_date_someone_somewhat/,Would you casually date someone somewhat *physically* unattractive? Virgin,"I hate to word it that way because like... they're a person and didn't pick their parents, and they're a cool person. But... they just aren't that pretty and they're like... kinda a loserish (unemployed living w/ family late 20s?)

Idk, this is kinda a nasty thing to say I know. Reflecting- it doesnt bother me at all, a lot of the things i'm into... aren't all that tied to physical aesthetics now that I think about it.

  
I have extremely bad anxiety and terrible self confidence. never approached someone in public. Working on this, have had good results with exposure therapy over the last few months just doing volunteer work and having casual conversations with people. Also made some basic smalltalk near daily on various errands, eye contact, smile etc practice with strangers. Back to dating- I had 3 separate dates with more objectively pretty women who even then I'm pretty... on paper a decent match for? that I bailed the day of on. Absolutely terrified and chickened out so hard multiple times.

I matched with someone because of their bio and went on a date. And it was actually okay. I was still insanely nervous but i think they were more than i was so idk if they even noticed tbh. we talked for about an hour.  it's at the point where #2 (she wants to cook for me) is planned and there was some banter around initiating physical touch so... i mean shes probably interested in at least some sort of intimacy.

Anxiety in other areas (school and work) i've found has gotten WAY way better with exposure therapy. I'm probably autistic, officially adhd but undiagnosed. Objectively I'm really using this person for exposure therapy. I'm SUPER proud that i actually went on the date, and fairly satisfied with the conversation. I did not do a good job making it feel like a date rather than just a meetup but it seems that is acceptable for a coffee. I'd really like to learn to be a good partner, i'd really like to try out intimacy, am generally touch starved. 

 I'm thinking absolute worst case we go on some fun little dates, maybe get some experience? This person isn't dating with intention in terms of kids/marriage- there's also been no real discussion beyond that which feels ethically a little eh? but also if we're both having fun it's fine right? 

  
Kinda a ramble and just looking for feedback. Typing this up... honestly I'm feeling like i'm putting myself in a bad situation that's disrespectful to her?

My stomach growls while my mind remains preoccupied with food to the point where I become unable to focus.
I think people who create hunger attack plans in advance obtain better outcomes than people who attempt to battle hunger through willpower alone. 

Here's what actually worked for me:
Electrolytes are everything. Hunger and dehydration feel really similar and often when I think i'm starving i'm just dehydrated.
Having something for the intense cravings helps too. Been using ozzi during fasting windows since it's basically just natural ingredients.
I learned to avoid starting with extended fasting periods right away. Started with 14 hours and worked up gradually instead of trying to do 20 hour fasts on day one like some keto influencer recommended.. 

Black coffee and herbal tea become your best friends. The warm liquid helps with that ""i need to consume something"" feeling.
Getting in ketosis is definitely the hard part, but does anyone else find that the hunger gets way more manageable once you're actually in ketosis? Those first few weeks are rough but it does get easier.",1,1758076827.0,ketobeginners,1,1.0,False

1nj1ee9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nj1ee9,What are causing my patches/receding hairline/thinning/pimples etc? 20F,"PLEASE HELP 
I’m 20 and i’m experiencing thinning of my hair, hair loss and hair fall, receding hairline, and pimples and patches on my scalp that itch. My scalp itches throughout the day and I also have dandruff. 

The pimples and eventual bald patches started I THINK when i was around 14. I had so much thick hair back then I didn’t really care. I think I would only have a few patches every year, but I’m not really sure. These patches most happen on the sides of my head and around the back. Since then, they’ve pretty much mostly all grown back I think.
I never noticed thinning of my hair and receding hairline really until I was around 17 or 18. That’s when i realized that my scalp would itch, my hair was falling out, it was thinning, and my hairline was receding. I also would still get pimples that itch and eventually turn into bald patches.
My parents made me go to the doctor when I was around 18 and they just said it was from stress and prescribed me a topical cream to grow the patch I had back, and i’m pretty sure it didn’t really work at all. They grow back eventually anyways for me mostly. 
I’m 20 now and it’s still the same. But now it’s getting to a point where I’m not the only one who notices it. 
Please help me. I want to grow my hair back and make my hair and scalp normal again so bad.
Some things i’ve noticed that make it worse I THINK are eating junk food and gluten. It might be placebo but i think it makes the itching and hair loss worse. 
I eat extremely clean for the most part, eating mostly meat and fruit and some veggies. I eat dairy occasionally and try to avoid grains and legumes mostly. I drink tea and coffee ocassionally, mostly tea. 
I have a reverse osmosis shower filter. 
Red light therapy i think seems to help speed up growing back the patches but that could possibly be placebo as well. 
Certain things like certain oils/shampoos I think break it out more i THINK.
I use a very clean shampoo and conditioner.

My only “health history” is that when I was a preteen/early teen, I had self-diagnosed malassezia folliculitis. I believe I had this because my symptoms were flesh colored bumps on the oily spots on my face (mostly forehead). it cleared up using Nizoral shampoo, but then it got used to the Nizoral and came back a little bit. I still have a little bit on my forehead sometimes but it’s not quite as bad. 
I’m wondering if the scalp pimples are fungal related as well? I’m not sure. But i’m not sure if Nizoral would work since I think my body has built a resistance to it. 

Please help me anyone🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼with remedies, cures, suggestions, or any possible diagnosis or idea what is causing all of this!!!!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ambition :** The second guest I’ve had on my stream, Kezman.

**Kezman :** The player Ambition I’ve known, and the streamer Ambition I see now is quite different. You’ve become a professional streamer now, huh. Though the part of you that obsesses over every small thing when it comes to the game has stayed the same.

**Ambition** **:** Have you been keeping up with some of the other old-CJ guys? What about Flame?

**Kezman :** Flame and I still talk a lot. We talked a lot around the end of his career, when he was telling me that he wanted to continue his player career and asking me for advice. Flame’s always been the kind of kid that needs 1-on-1 attention, even back during the CJ days. He’s the kind of player that reciprocates attention with effort. But also the kind of player that will sleep in and start straying if you don’t. I found it kinda funny at the time, because he would pout and go “Why do you only go out for coffee with Ambition?”

**Ambition** **:** He’s always liked being close to his teammates. Helios was very receptive of him. I wasn’t.

**Kezman :** You were more of the cold-shoulder kind of guy at the time that would go “Bro, get off me” when he would try to get close. So that’s why Helios was basically carrying him around everywhere during CJ. He had it rough. Imagine being Helios, where Ambition is always farming your Wraiths, and Flame is always farming your Krugs.

**Ambition** **:** Those were the days. Man, we all lived like hobos back in the MiG house. Everyone wearing faded t-shirts and shorts. I remember when CptJack’s dad came to visit, and took us all out to go eat at Outback Steakhouse. Man. That was everybody’s first time going to someplace that fancy.

**Kezman :** How the times have changed.

**Ambition** **:** He took all the guys from both Blaze and Frost out, too. That was a really big deal, because we were all just living off $3 each for every meal back then. I remember all of us taking care of our meals at a kimbap joint (Korean equivalent of Waffle House), where we would always just order the cheapest thing on the menu.

**Kezman :** Nothing over $5. I think we upped the limit to $7 per person a couple years later. Those were the Dark Ages, because we were all just starting out. OnAir and I would stream all day, then pool our donation money together to feed all of you guys. Reapered as well. Cloudtemplar would also pitch in his stream donations.

**Ambition** **:** How did we even end up paying for our internet café fees?

**Kezman :** We didn’t have to pay for that, because we had a PC-bang as our sponsor. Actually, we did pay. Just at a discounted rate. We had no choice because our gaming house wasn’t big enough, and Blaze had to go practice at that PC-bang instead. It was only after we switched over to Azubu, where structure became a thing. The MiG days were really tough.

**Ambition** **:** I was young at the time, and all I cared about was that I got to play the game I liked. So I think the joy of being paid to play League was bigger than the conditions at the time.

**Kezman :** It got a lot better in 2013 with Azubu. But I remember OnAir and me feeling very sorry, because both of us felt all of you deserved better. It was worse because we were also both dirt poor, and couldn’t do anything about it. That’s why OnAir and I would go participate in MBCGame BroodWar shows to get extra cash for the team. If you took me back though, I’d do it all again.

**Chat :** Did you witness the apology Flame made to Ambition in 2014? You know, because of how his performance prevented CJ from making Worlds that year because he got obsessed with girls.

**Kezman :** That was interesting. So 2014 was when Flame really started becoming popular, and when fans would send him DMs all the time. That was his first time experiencing that kind of popularity, and he kind of got caught up in all of it. That definitely led to a dip in his performance, although he would always deny it.

He told everyone that it wasn’t going to affect his gameplay, so we all just kind of let him be. But when that eventually stopped the team from making Worlds that year, he had his “I f\*\*ked up” realization, and went around begged for everyone’s forgiveness.

**Chat :** Were you also there to witness the hate that formed between CptJack and Ambition?

**Kezman :** I’m not sure how much both of you have opened up about this on stream, so I’m unsure as to where to draw the line.

**Ambition** **:** No lines. You can tell the full story.

**Kezman :** So Ambition wouldn’t go off on any of his new teammates. He was only a dick to the teammates that had always been on Blaze. That’s why Ambition would always be yelling at Helios, although you kind of gave up on him after a while because you thought “He can’t be reformed.”

This actually ties in to a moment I remember quite fondly. So it was when we went to Dallas, I think for IPL. It was the Losers Bracket game where we got smashed by WE, and Helios was playing Amumu. So during the game, Ambition would visibly jump up from his chair in rage whenever Helios would miss an Amumu Q. I remember that moment clearly, because we had no observers back then. So I would be watching the games from your screens a couple feet away. You would literally get so mad at Helios that you would jump up 1 full foot from your chair.

Watching that, I remember having a “How am I going to fix these kids” moment. But I also understood where that was coming from though, because I think all of us felt that we didn’t deserve to lose to WE the way we did.

**Ambition** **:** Back then, the idea of losing to a non-Korean team was unthinkable. So I think emotions were high during that WE game because we had lost to teams like FNC and M5 during the event as well. Yeah, I remember. I remember throwing a fit at CptJack during that event because we got our asses kicked by Rekkles.

**Kezman :** In a way though, I think that kind of drive was what led us to winning IEM 7.

**Chat :** Ambition said during Season 2 that he was the best Midlaner in the world. He also said that xPeke was #2, and everyone else was irrelevant. Thoughts?

**Kezman :** To be honest, that’s also what I thought. At the time, I really did think that no other Midlaner could challenge Ambition. I remember all the non-Korean Midlaners struggling hard in lane against us.

**Ambition** **:** xPeke was really the only Midlaner outside of Korea that I thought was good at the time.

**Chat :** How did you react when you saw Ambition’s Khazix get solokilled by Faker’s Nidalee?

**Kezman :** I honestly didn’t even see why he got killed. It was just unexpected, because I knew Ambition was a kind of player that would never get hit by a Nidalee spear in that kind of situation.

**Ambition** **:** That was old Nidalee too, with the Q projectile being much wider. Before that game, poke Nidalee really wasn’t a thing. That game was what got everyone to start playing the long-range poke Nidalee.

**Kezman :** The evolution was a mistake on Ambition’s part though, with him pressing it out of habit. But at the time, I thought that Ambition was a better Midlaner than Faker. Although I changed my mind once I witnessed what happened in that game.

**Ambition** **:** Nah. Faker was already better than me during his debut year in Season 3.

**Kezman :** You have to understand my position at the time, where I’m not really in the spot to send my player out onto stage with the idea that the opponent is better than him. That Nidalee spear was a wake-up call though. Not only for Ambition, but for me as well.

**Ambition** **:** I was pissed off after we lost that Game 1, but I also did think that “Oh, this kid is good.” I think I was able to internalize that really quick.

**Kezman :** You were always good at accepting things objectively. I remember you always having a very clear idea of which player was, and wasn’t better than you. I think the only people that were on the ‘better’ list were Faker and Ryu.

But hey, that solokill ended up working out for you in the end, right? You were immortalized by becoming the first solokill of League’s icon.

**Ambition** **:** Mhm. I was Faker’s first. Nobody can take that away from me. Always featured in all Faker documentaries and montages.

**Chat :** Who was the most problematic brat of CJ?

**Kezman :** In terms of skill? Or as a human being?

**Ambition** **:** For skill, it’d have to be CptJack. Solely because he was the ADC, and ADC was the position that had the highest expectations during those days. So he was naturally the recipient of everyone’s attention.

**Kezman :** I had high hopes for the CptJack-Lustboy lane, because I knew they were good. CptJack also had a lot of confidence in his play and micro as well. But there was a certain point where he seemed to have hit his ceiling, where his upwards trend kind of stopped.

When it comes to player skill, I always think it’s a constant battle of breaking limits. A constant repetition of stagnation after growth, and additional growth once the player overcomes that stagnation. But for CptJack, his stagnation just kind of continued

**Ambition** **:** For Flame, it was the TP meta. His stagnation started once TP meta started, and he never got over it.

**Kezman :** But CptJack was definitely the type that’s just naturally gifted when it comes to games though. Same for MadLife. But MadLife has low fuel efficiency, where he wasn’t able to play games for extended periods of time.

**Ambition** **:** I think that MadLife would have had a longer career if he wasn’t a Support. As the naturally-gifted kind of gamer, he would’ve thrived for much longer if he played a different position.

**Kezman :** He started out as an ADC though, with him switching to Support because we didn’t have one.

**Ambition** **:** Well, the concept of fixed lanes weren’t a thing back then as well.

**Kezman :** We ended up making him our Support because he gave us the best results. I remember trying out guys like Woong and Locodoco for Support and it not working out at all. That’s a testament to the talent MadLife had as a player though, considering how he was able to succeed at Support without being one in the first place.

**Chat :** Wasn’t Blaze just 5 Junglers that had 4 people roleswap because Helios couldn’t play any role other than Jungle?

**Ambition** **:** It was a different time. All of us were recruited because we were high-tier players, and the only way to get to that point was by being good at every position. Everyone had at least 1 champion for each role in their Top 5-7 most played. It only really changed once the EU Meta became the norm.

**Chat :** Did Riot or the LPL contact you for an interview to star in Uzi’s Hall of Legends documentary?

**Kezman :** I don’t think so. Oh no, I think I did get an interview request. Aren’t there two different versions? Like a Chinese one, and a Korean one.

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. The Korean one is where a bunch of Korean ADCs show up and reminisce on the times they lost to Uzi.

**Kezman :** Man. Only if Uzi didn’t have to deal with his wrist injury. As someone that’s coached him, I can vouch that he was one of the players in China at the time that had the best professional mindset.

One thing I really struggled with during my tenure in China was nurturing that kind of professional mindset with players. Things like what players need to do to get better, practicing champions they didn’t like, etc. I would sit down with a translator and talk about these things with Chinese players all the time.

Again, it was a different time. Of course, all the players were hyper-competitive and wanted to win. But there also needed to be a culture of discipline that went along with it – which was something that a lot of coaches had trouble instilling into players at the time.

The issue kind of stems from how League doesn’t have a correct answer. So conflicts inevitably occur when two players have opposite opinions, and neither side is willing to back down because each player thinks his view is right. This kind of notion existed with Uzi back in 2018 RNG, where he had a view of the game that was centered around him.

But outside of Uzi, we also had extremely talented players like Xiaohu, Mlxg, Karsa and Ming, who were all good at consistently playing their part for the team. So what ended up happening was Uzi letting go of that kind of perspective once we started winning. Before Uzi joined 2018 RNG, he hadn’t won a single Championship. But once we started securing Championships, he was able to let go of a lot of his Championship woes and his self-centered view on the game. I really think that it was a realization moment for him, where he was finally able to let go of that view once he saw that his team was capable of winning without it. It was definitely a turning point in him really opening up to other in-game perspectives for the rest of his career.

**Ambition** **:** I remember a lot of LCK players thinking that Uzi becoming more of a team player was because he was surrounded by good players that actually knew how to play around him.

**Kezman :** We don’t really see it in ADCs now, but Uzi was really a player that loved playing aggressively and hard-pressuring his opponent. To where he would actively request that his Jungler start at a specific camp, or path a certain way to supplement his playstyle. His entire plan revolved around him setting up and winning the Lv3 fight in the Botlane. He loved doing it, and he was good at it. The team realized that he was very good at planning and designing this kind of strategy, and we all committed to fully enable that kind of playstyle.

**Ambition** **:** If you think about it, there’s really no point in having a player like Uzi on your team if your plan is to suppress him and shut him down, right?

**Kezman :** You kind of have to say yes because he is good, and because he proves himself with results, right? The reason why I think 2018 RNG was able to have such a high winrate despite being a one-trick team was because that one trick we had was centered around Uzi. Uzi was just that good, and the players around him that committed to that playstyle were also good.

**Ambition** **:** That was pretty much the story of Samsung as well. We tried all sorts of strategies that involved investing in different lanes. But none of them worked out as well as investing in Ruler, so we would just go all-in on the Ruler one-trick team style. That’s why we lost a lot of games when bruisers became meta, because all the enemy bruisers would just dogpile onto Ruler. It’s also why we crumbled when Herald was added.

**Kezman :** All the additional objectives made the game a lot more difficult, along with shifting the game away from the individual player to the interactions involving those objectives.

**Chat :** Can you elaborate on your beef with NoFe?

**Kezman :** Beef? I don’t really think I’ve had beef with NoFe. We would sometimes disagree on certain things when sharing opinions about the game, or talking about how to construct rosters. But I’ve always seen him as an extremely intelligent person, and someone that just kind of gets stuff done on his own. Even after he transitioned to casting, we would always talk and hang out at LolPark. I don’t really keep up with online forums at all, so I’m not sure that this beef is exactly about.

I guess there could have been discontent on NoFe’s end, because I was in the position to either sign off on the things he wanted to do. So there could have been a situation where there was something he wanted to do on 2020 HLE, where I had to turn down because the team wasn’t in a position to support it. But that’s just discontent that stems from work, right? Not full on beef. Conflicts occur frequently between head coaches, coaches and players all the time throughout the course of a season.

**Chat :** Who was the ADC that was set to start on the main roster for 2020 HLE? Because it was that player revoking his decision 1 week before the season that led to Vsta becoming the starting ADC.

**Kezman :** This isn’t something I can share, because it has directly to do with that player in question.

**Chat :** What about the rumor saying you turned down the organization’s plan to invest a ton of money to buy a superteam during the 19-20 offseason?

**Kezman :** That rumor just doesn’t make sense, because no head coach would ever turn down an organization offering him a blank check. The team is saying that they’re giving you wads of cash to get good players. No head coach would ever say no to that. Who says no to someone that’s trying to give you money? This rumor is just straight up not true.

**Ambition** **:** When someone is trying to give you money, the only acceptable response other than “Yes” is “Can I have more?”

**Chat :** I think that rumor was from when OnAir was the head coach for HLE, not Kezman.

**Chat :** NoFe did say that there were some 2020 HLE stories that can only be told after the LoL scene is dead and 10 years under.

**Kezman :** I don’t know how to answer that, because I don’t know what he was referring to. I need something to go off of.

**Ambition** **:** Just ask directly. Just straight up ask what party I voted for in the recent election. Don’t beat around the bush by saying “I heard you had interesting political preferences.”

**Chat :** Are you aware that the hate for your 2021 HLE drafts instantly died down once the Morgan-Dudu-Yohan-Arthur-Willer Mock Draft Challenge became popular in Korea?

**Kezman :** I’ve heard people mention it to me, yes.

**Ambition** **:** That’s 2021 HLE, right? With Chovy and Deft. Ohh. So people doing mock drafts in 2021 HLE’s perspective was called the ‘Kezman Challenge’. I see.

**Chat :** What was your most difficult off-season while being a part of HLE from 2020 to 2023?

**Kezman :** It would have to be the 19-20 offseason when I first came to HLE. That year was challenging because it was my first year back from the LPL, and I was also given the task of laying down the structure of the HLE League organization. Not only that, but by the time I got signed and started my job at HLE, almost all the free agents for that year had already been signed. So I had to try and make the best out of what was left of the 19-20 player market.

**Ambition** **:** Ohh. That was the HLE season with Cuvee and Haru. Man. Who was responsible for signing Cuvee? Y’all should have asked me about Cuvee before getting him on board.

**Kezman :** I was the one that pushed for Cuvee. The reason being because I thought his potential hadn’t yet been realized when I reviewed his games. From an outside perspective, I wanted to really tap in to the aggressive potential he showed in the past with champions like Kennen and Camille.

**Ambition** **:** That’s one misconception people often have about Cuvee. People think that he was never able to fly because his Jungler would always path towards Botlane. But it was the other way around, where his Jungler would always path Botlane because he couldn’t fly.

**Kezman :** I saw him as a player that was on a team like RNG, and wanted to give him the opportunity to really break through his ceiling by setting him up to become a Toplane carry.

**Ambition** **:** Until then, he’s played for so long on rosters where his role was to survive in a Toplane island to where I think his playstyle had solidified to that one style of play.

**Kezman :** There definitely was an aspect of him being very mild-mannered, which I think was the reason why he was able to play that kind of role for so long. During 2020 HLE, I remember everyone on that roster, including Cuvee and Haru all going through some tough times during the season. Because our results weren’t very good, right?

Cuvee went through a lot that year. I requested that he fulfill a leader role in that team, and he tried his best despite his personality not being a good fit for it. I have a lot of respect for Cuvee.

**Chat :** Is it true that Flame took the least amount of showers in CJ?

**Ambition** **:** CJ was just uh, an embarrassing time for all of us.

**Kezman :** I told you guys, time and time again to not go outside wearing flip-flops. None of you would listen though. All of you would go outside with t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops, when everyone else was going about their workday in business attire. You guys were literally the only ones dressed like that in that entire 9-story building that we were located in.

**Ambition** **:** So the building we were located in was SK M-City, which also happened to be a office complex building in the most high-end area of Ilsan. So it was literally a neighborhood full of people in business attire going about their regular workday. Looking back, we were basically a troupe of hobos walking around a high-end business district.

**Kezman :** You guys wouldn’t change, too. It was always the same green-colored Razer t-shirt and flip-flops. I remember this because the tenants of nearby buildings would file complaints to the team saying that you guys were actively devaluing the neighborhood. They were literally begging us to please have you guys walk around in presentable attire.

**Ambition** **:** We ended up banning flip-flops because of that, right?

**Kezman :** We made a rule against it, but you guys broke it just a couple days later.

**Ambition** **:** Us gamers can’t help it though. It was exactly like that during Samsung too, where we were also located in a really well-off area full of high-paying white-collar offices. We marched around that neighborhood as shameless hobos, with CoreJJ waltzing around with his unorganized, spiky hairdo.

**Chat :** I was the fan that asked for a hug during the 2022 CampOne event. I was a CJ-HLE fan all throughout my teens. I know the role that you played in HLE having their first Championship in 2024, and I want to thank you for it.

**Kezman :** Thank you. It’s really touching that you think of it that way. Considering that HLE won its first Championship the season after I left, I definitely could have been ‘jelly’, right? Even just a little bit. But I was just as happy for HLE when they won. While I wasn’t the perfect head coach for HLE, and made a lot of mistakes during my 2020-2023 tenure – I did get a sense of gratification when I saw some of the players and systems I had put into place bear fruit.

**Ambition** **:** Oh yeah. Because you left HLE after finalizing the roster for the 2024 season.

**Kezman :** It was a synergy of all the players, and also the HLE management’s thirst for success that year. Everything worked out.

**Chat :** Is there a head coach that you consider your rival, or someone that you deem as similar in terms of caliber or career?

**Kezman :** I’ve never really thought about it. But while I was in China, I did view Kkoma as a worthy, or formidable opponent. So before I returned to Korea. I guess I can say this jokingly because I’m good friends with Kkoma.

**Chat :** I feel there’s a lot of confusion as to what the position of ‘Director’ or ‘Supervisor’ (총감독) is in the E-Sports industry, and it’s role in a team. Can you elaborate?

**Kezman :** This is actually something that I’ve wrestled with quite a bit. So when I was promoted to Director/Supervisor, it wasn’t something that I exactly wanted. I actually wanted to continue working as a head coach. So when I was put into that role, I remember spending a couple months trying to figure out what my exact role was on the team.

What I ended up doing was every job that was left. Including things that I personally wished the team, or management had done for me during my time as a head coach. So if there were management-bound interferences that were about fall onto the ground-level, I would step in as Director/Supervisor and stop it. I guess you could think of it as the guy that takes care of anything that could result in conflict or discomfort when it comes to interactions between the management, head coach, coaches, and players.

You could say that this is the job description of the General Manager. But the thing with HLE was that there was already an existing GM in the main HLE HQ, so they couldn’t exactly give me an overlapping title. So I ended up being a sort of middleman or arbitrator between the HQ and LoL team, and a guy with the title of Director/Supervisor that performs the job of an on-site GM.

**Ambition** **:** So someone that tries to create an environment where the head coach can focus only on game-related things.

**Kezman :** That’s what I was going for. Think about a situation where a head coach has to say some harsh words to a player. While tough love is necessary, players are, and will get their feeling hurt in the process. Even just a little bit. But once those schisms appear, it’s really difficult as a head coach to approach a player and make amends. So what I would do as a director/supervisor is be the polar opposite of the head coach. If the head coach was playing good cop, I would play bad cop. If the head coach was going stick, I’d go carrot. Vice versa.

**Ambition** **:** Don’t you also have to watch over other titles like Valorant as supervisor/head coach?

**Kezman :** But HLE only had 1 team, which was the LoL team at the time. There were pushes internally to expand to other titles, but the organization came to the decision to focus on LoL in the short term.

**Ambition** **:** I guess a more fitting English title for the job would be head-head coach, or main coach. Something like that.

**Chat :** The performance analyst ‘Bibra’ has been a part of the HLE coaching staff since 2021. Can you specify what he does for the team?

**Kezman :** He’s not a widely-known name in the industry, so I think some people could be curious as to what he does. So my first time working with Bibra was in 2018 RNG. Bibra was the performance analyst, and Heart was the coach. Back during 2018, I remember having a lot of disagreements and discussions with Heart when it came to things like draft. But Bibra would appropriately chime into those discussions with some very good ideas, to where his interventions and opinions were sometimes single-handedly responsible for us winning a game that happened just minutes after. He was not only a very through analyst, but also somebody that knew exactly what he needed to do for the team as performance analyst.

**Ambition** **:** So I still think people are curious as to what a performance actually does.

**Kezman :** It’s someone that needs to keep tabs on both the state his, and the opponent’s team is in. In terms of what we’re good at and what the opponent is good at. Within the coaching hierarchy, the head coach and coach doesn’t have enough time to watch and review every single game, right? So what the performance analyst does is review all of those games, organize and isolate relevant data, and relay it on to the coach and head coach. In a mock draft environment, he will be the one that will be telling us relevant information like the specific draft patterns, champion preferences, scrim data, SoloQ history of the opposing team.

While it’s an accompanying position, the role is extremely crucial. Like I said, the coach and head coach just doesn’t have the time to do all the things I mentioned above. In a schedule of accompanying players to stage games, providing feedback to those stage games, participating in scrims, doing VOD reviews, etc – the performance analyst does everything that the head coach and coach doesn’t have the time to do.

One thing that I had Bibra do during our time together was creating short, 5-minute videos that the players could watch. These videos would include things like crucial mistakes that were made in past games and specific ward locations that were collected after reviewing every single game. I would have Bibra make those videos, and I would then make the players watch those videos before they go play games on-stage.

**Ambition** **:** So it’s not a job or position that has that much exposure to the public.

**Kezman :** Right. It’s really hard to get a grasp of what a performance analyst actually does from an outside perspective.

**Chat :** The fans regard the 2022 development roster as something that took place because a larger grandiose plan during the offseason failed. Is this true?

**Kezman :** At least in my perspective, I do think that the ‘grand plan’ of the 21-22 offseason not working out is true. So the thing about 2022 was that my contract had also expired at the end of 2022, and I was still in the process of re-negotiating my contract with HLE while the off-season was taking place. So I wasn’t in the position to actively go out and pursue roster-related moves for the team. I ended up getting my contract renewed, but it was a bit too little too late. That’s at least my side of the story, where I feel I didn’t have the freedom to make the moves I wanted to make because I had arrived in the player market a bit too late.

**Ambition** **:** What was the 2022 HLE roster again?

**Kezman :** It was Dudu, Onfleek, Willer, Karis, SamD and Vsta.

**Ambition** **:** How did you guys do?

**Kezman :** 10th in both Spring and Summer, of course. It was a full, 5-man development roster. But I actually have a lot of love for this 2022 team, because all of the players really put their all into the 2022 season despite its hardships.

**Ambition** **:** So to summarize, the 2022 HLE roster didn’t go development mode and release all their existing players because you or HLE wanted to from the beginning. But it was a situation where it was too late for you to do anything by the time your contract for head coach had been renewed.

**Kezman :** Right. By the time my contract was renewed, the offseason was already over.

So what ended up happening in at the end of 2021 was us being eliminated in Worlds Quarterfinals by T1. Right around that time, I remember making a direct appeal to management that it would probably be best that the team try and re-sign key players like Chovy and Deft before heading into the 21-22 offseason. Well, Deft was a bit iffy, because he had already told the team that he was unsure about his future career due to military obligations and his back pains.

Ok. So one thing that’s really difficult about any offseason is deciding, and securing the player that’s going to be the basis of your team. Once that player is secured, that player will act as the centerpiece of your potential roster that you use to draw other players in.

**Ambition :** So something like a “Our Midlaner is Chovy, wanna come?” kind of thing.

**Kezman :** But what happens when you have no basis at all, is equivalent to a hard reset. You start from 0. It’s bad courtesy of me to mention player names, but I tried really, really hard to get Chovy and Deft again for 2022. Especially Chovy. Chovy was a player that I’ve had my sights on even before he went to DRX. I visited his family at his house in-person multiple times to try and persuade him. Long story short, I invested a lot of time and effort up to try and secure Chovy right up until he signed with HLE.

**Ambition :** One thing that some old-school fans need to know is that the value judgements of players have shifted with the increase in player salaries. Once we developed into an ecosystem where every team just about pays a similar but large amount – players naturally became more inclined to value winning over extra money. So this inevitably leads to players asking “Who am I playing with?” when being recruited. If you’re a GM or team that doesn’t have a good answer to that question, that player is most likely going somewhere else that does.

**Kezman :** So assuming that the free agent in question is a high-tier player, multiple teams are going to have similar offers in terms of salary. So in a situation where that player is choosing between different teams with similar financial incentives, the next point of comparison will always be the roster. So the better your ‘basis’ player is, the higher chance that you’ll have of attracting and branching out players of a similar level around him.

I’m not sure if this is OK to say, but even I was considering offers from different teams at the time. Because I was in a position where the industry and public views me as the person responsible for strategizing the team’s offseason, but I was not in a position to do so because I was still in limbo of re-negotiating my own contract. So there was an incentive for me to not consider HLE, because I knew that by the time I did renew my contract with HLE, it would be too late. That would result in me being the recipient of hate and responsibility for ‘failing’ the offseason, which I didn’t want.

**Ambition :** I feel like this was a situation where you could have brought in the press and tried to sway public opinion.

**Kezman :** That’s not a good idea. HLE is a company that uses sports as the primary means of spreading and elevating their corporate image to the public. So the image of the team is equivalent to the reputation of not only HLE, but the Hanwha Group as a whole by association. So there’s no reason for me to sour my relationship with Hanwha, or try to save my own skin by driving Hanwha into the dirt. If I did, I would just be tarnishing my own reputation in the process. And besides, assuming responsibility and tanking public aggro is part of my job as head coach – so it was only right that I did so.

**Chat :** Is it true that both Rookie and Mata could have joined CJ Blaze?

**Kezman :** Partially. So this goes back to a fanmeet that we hosted at Shindorim with both the Blaze and Frost roster. We had different players form teams with fans and play each other. Rookie was on Rapidstar’s roster, and he put on a pretty awe-inspiring show with LeeSin. I remember talking to some of the people on CJ about it, and how this kid was a good player. But we never gave it any second thought, because it was only just a fanmeet event match.

I guess that could count as Rookie almost joining Blaze. But I do remember being quite interested in him, where I went up to him in person to ask his SoloQ rank, and whether or not he was interested in going pro. I’m not sure about Blaze.

**Chat :** I’m joking, but remember 8 years ago where you said on NiceGameTV that you wouldn’t recruit Faker because you already had Ambition and RapidStar on your team. If you could go back in time, would you say something different?

**Kezman :** As a coach, it’s part of my job to prop up my players whenever I can. It would be wrong for me to say, “Oh, I’d get rid of Ambition and Rapidstar for Faker because he’s better” in an official interview, of all things. That’s just wrong. I gotta look after my own boys, not some other guy’s kid. Best I can say is acknowledge that the other guy’s kid is pretty good, but also rep my boys by saying they’re just as cool.

**Chat :** Okay, but what if you really had the chance to recruit Faker? (As a joke, of course)

**Kezman :** If I could, of course I would. Heck, if it meant I had to switch teams over to wherever Faker was at, I’d go. We’re all people, c’mon.",3,1758076680.0,leagueoflegends,0,1.0,False

1nj1d2u,https://i.redd.it/5nsayxqd0npf1.jpeg,"How to Clean, Condition, and Maintain Your Home Theater Leather Seating (For Any Brand)","Proper care of your home theater leather seating helps it stay comfortable, luxurious, and long-lasting. Here’s a professional yet practical guide to keeping your seating in top condition.
 
1. Weekly Dusting and Light Cleaning
 
Wipe your seats with a soft microfiber cloth to remove dust and surface dirt.
 
For small spills, lightly dampen the cloth with distilled water. Avoid soaking the leather.
 
Use circular motions rather than scrubbing in straight lines to maintain the finish.
 
Why it matters: Even genuine leather can accumulate dust that dulls its look or creates micro-scratches over time.
 
Common Mistake: Using rough cloths or household cleaners can leave marks or strip natural oils.
 
2. Monthly Deep Cleaning
 
Use a pH-balanced leather cleaner or mild soap solution suitable for genuine leather.
 
Lightly dampen a cloth with the solution and gently wipe the surface.
 
Follow with a clean, damp cloth to remove residue, then dry immediately with a soft towel.
 
Tip: Always test cleaners on a hidden area first. Harsh chemicals can damage the leather finish and make it appear dull.
 
3. Conditioning (Every 3–6 Months)
 
Apply a lightweight leather conditioner designed for home furniture. Avoid heavy oils or waxes.
 
Rub a small amount into the leather using circular motions.
 
Let it absorb for 20–30 minutes, then buff with a dry cloth.
 
Why it helps: Conditioning restores natural oils, keeping leather soft, supple, and resistant to cracking.
 
Common Mistake: Over-conditioning or using thick waxes can leave a sticky surface or cause uneven darkening.
 
4. Cleaning Spills and Stains
 
Promptly addressing spills and stains helps prevent permanent damage. Different types of stains require slightly different approaches:
 
Liquid spills (water, soda, coffee, juice):
 
Blot immediately with a soft, clean cloth—never rub. For sticky residues, lightly dampen the cloth with distilled water and blot until clean.
 
Oily or greasy stains (food, butter, lotions):
 
Sprinkle a small amount of cornstarch or talcum powder on the spot to absorb the oil. Let it sit for 15–30 minutes, then gently brush it off and wipe the area with a lightly damp cloth.
 
Ink or dye stains:
 
Use a leather-safe ink remover or a specialized leather cleaner. Always test on a hidden area first. Apply sparingly and gently, avoiding aggressive scrubbing.
 
Food crumbs or dry debris:
 
Use a soft brush or vacuum with a soft brush attachment to remove particles. Avoid pressing hard, which can embed debris into the leather texture.
 
Pro Tip: Quick action is key. The longer a spill sits on genuine leather, the more it can penetrate and alter the surface. Avoid alcohol, harsh detergents, or abrasive tools—they can damage the leather finish.
 
5. Preventive Care
 
Keep seating out of direct sunlight to prevent fading.
 
Maintain moderate indoor humidity (40–60%) to avoid drying or mildew.
 
Avoid placing sharp objects or heavy items on the leather.
 
Scientific Note: Genuine leather absorbs and releases moisture; controlling the environment preserves its softness and appearance.
 
6. Choosing Products
 
Cleaners: pH-balanced, non-toxic, labeled for leather furniture.
 
Conditioners: Lightweight, non-greasy, designed for home leather; avoid heavy waxes or petroleum oils.
 
Common Mistake: Multipurpose cleaners or abrasive scrubbing can remove the protective finish or damage leather fibers.
 
With regular care, your genuine leather home theater seating will stay soft, comfortable, and visually appealing for years. Light weekly cleaning, monthly deep cleaning, periodic conditioning, and prompt attention to spills and stains protect your investment while avoiding common mistakes that can shorten its lifespan.",1,1758076610.0,weilianda,0,1.0,False

I'm not entirely sure what to do about my relationship with my best friend, which feels like it's on the rocks. To start, I am 100% anxiously attached (in general). I've been doing therapy, and I think I can see some slow progress, but I still feel like I'm at the beginning of the process. I'm becoming aware of my patterns, though, and how they relate to my childhood.

I'm also fairly confident that my best friend is avoidant, based on how he's talked about his cold and distant father, himself, and other people, and just based on what I've seen since knowing him.

Anyway, my best friend and I started out really close. We met online, and then became IRL friends. I will admit, we are (were?) friends with benefits, but he was definitely more friend than benefits. I had always assumed the friendship was fairly deep, but now I'm not so sure.

To be vague enough to have plausible deniability, this friend hasn't been showing up for me much for most of the last year. He'll make vague commitments to do things, and then those things will never happen. Or worse, he'll suggest planning something, sometimes things that require tickets or reservations, and then follow up with me at the very last minute.

He ""values independence and freedom"", and definitely seems to live his life on his terms, even when it inconveniences other people, in ways that are entirely selfish. I'll spare the specifics, but he made me miss a really important event we had planned together months ago because he stayed out too late the night before and, instead of rearranging his day to accommodate me, kept his usual schedule and we missed the event.

This is triggering the hell out of me, but I'm also starting to rethink the friendship. He does this kind of thing a lot, and it's really disrespectful. Meanwhile, he seems to be able to manage scheduling things that _he_ wants to do just fine. It all just feels really one-sided, which isn't necessarily an avoidant thing

I've been pulling away a bit this week after a similar painful experience this past weekend. I will explain to him this week what's bothering me, but mostly as a courtesy; I really don't think anything is going to change. (I have extra therapy this week, too, just for this lol.) I really don't know how he processes _his_ emotions, though, so that might be a wildcard, too. In the past, though, when people present him with conflict, he just gets dismissive and seems kind of annoyed with them. I feel like I need a few weeks apart from him, though, either way.

I've considered kinda ""downgrading"" the friendship, and suggesting that we just do easy things like coffee or hanging out, low-stakes things that can be arranged at the last minute, but that feels like losing a part of myself. I don't know if I can care _less_ about this person; it feels like it has to be all or nothing. I don't want a superficial friendship with him, and I'm afraid because I think that is how he conducts _all_ of his relationships. He won't even commit to the man he loves; what hope is there for me?

Anyway. Anyone have any advice, I guess? Can APs and DAs be close friends? Do I need to disengage completely to protect myself? Thanks for listening.",1,1758076494.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

They told me it wouldn’t work because the bottle sits higher than the machine, so the milk could siphon out. My idea was to place the fridge in the cabinet/bench *below* the machine.

Does anyone know if the Jura’s pump can handle pulling milk upwards from a fridge sitting below counter height? Or is this going to cause issues with flow/head pressure?

I’m 20 and i’m experiencing thinning of my hair, hair loss and hair fall, receding hairline, and pimples and patches on my scalp that itch. My scalp itches throughout the day and I also have dandruff. 

The pimples and eventual bald patches started I THINK when i was around 14. I had so much thick hair back then I didn’t really care. I think I would only have a few patches every year, but I’m not really sure. These patches most happen on the sides of my head and around the back. Since then, they’ve pretty much mostly all grown back I think.
I never noticed thinning of my hair and receding hairline really until I was around 17 or 18. That’s when i realized that my scalp would itch, my hair was falling out, it was thinning, and my hairline was receding. I also would still get pimples that itch and eventually turn into bald patches.
My parents made me go to the doctor when I was around 18 and they just said it was from stress and prescribed me a topical cream to grow the patch I had back, and i’m pretty sure it didn’t really work at all. They grow back eventually anyways for me mostly. 
I’m 20 now and it’s still the same. But now it’s getting to a point where I’m not the only one who notices it. 
Please help me. I want to grow my hair back and make my hair and scalp normal again so bad.
Some things i’ve noticed that make it worse I THINK are eating junk food and gluten. It might be placebo but i think it makes the itching and hair loss worse. 
I eat extremely clean for the most part, eating mostly meat and fruit and some veggies. I eat dairy occasionally and try to avoid grains and legumes mostly. I drink tea and coffee ocassionally, mostly tea. 
I have a reverse osmosis shower filter. 
Red light therapy i think seems to help speed up growing back the patches but that could possibly be placebo as well. 
Certain things like certain oils/shampoos I think break it out more i THINK.
I use a very clean shampoo and conditioner.

My only “health history” is that when I was a preteen/early teen, I had self-diagnosed malassezia folliculitis. I believe I had this because my symptoms were flesh colored bumps on the oily spots on my face (mostly forehead). it cleared up using Nizoral shampoo, but then it got used to the Nizoral and came back a little bit. I still have a little bit on my forehead sometimes but it’s not quite as bad. 
I’m wondering if the scalp pimples are fungal related as well? I’m not sure. But i’m not sure if Nizoral would work since I think my body has built a resistance to it. 

Please help me anyone🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼with remedies, cures, suggestions, or any possible diagnosis or idea what is causing all of this!!!!

One plan is to join a police department in whatever city I end up choosing or state and then from there work for a little bit and then obviously my end goal is my coffee shop but it depends how soon I get to do that. If I get married then I can't do it as soon and stuff like that but that was one plan and another plan was to join the army or not the army the military for a little bit and use that as a stepping stone same as what I'm doing in plan A but this plan would bring me free school and a whole lot of benefits but my whole reason for not wanting to go to school is because school is expensive so I would have free school with that plan



 most of my family agrees and they want me to to join the military but it's my sister who doesn't want me to do that to myself and just because like obviously America you know kind of have a little bit of a bad rep and plan B would also include the coffee shop later on so that's my end goal either way but it depends how I'm going to do it because if I do plan A I would I would try to find a roommate in whatever city I end up choosing or state and apply to the the local police department police department and work over there



 without having to pay full rent because I have a roommate and then from there I could just keep working and saving and then then do that so I'm kind of leaning towards plan A but because I don't know I feel like we might go to war soon and I don't know if plan B is the best option but I'm not sure what I should do any advice.

This is a Long post about Sexual Transmutation and the invisible forces that hinder it.*



# AUTOMATICITY : THE MECHANISM OF OBEDIENCE

Human Body is evolved to reduce load.

Repetitive cognitive load causes Neurons to fire together and wire together which develops automaticity/habits.

Thanks to that, we can multitask. However, it's not just Neurons, environment plays a role in this too. 

**Environment acts as stimulus for certain automatic neural impulses.** 

1. Old songs and Music can make you feel nostalgic.

2. Fresh Cut-grass can bring childhood memories back.

3. Even your favorite song, when set as Alarm Ringtone can start irritating you.

***With enough repetitive exposure to specific environmental cues: YOUR EMOTIONS CAN BE MANIPULATED THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT.***

With repetition, This automaticity becomes so efficient that it starts happening WITHOUT your intellectual consent.

Just like a Dog that can be trained to perform tricks with treats, 

A human can be trained as well using treats of dopamine instead. 



Give it enough dopamine and repetition, this AUTOMATICITY WILL OVERRIDE your WISHES. YOU LOSE CONTROL OVER YOUR BODY and MIND. 

Give it decades, it WILL HAPPEN regardless of your choice. **Choice becomes an illusion.** 

**When you are Compelled by this cycle of doom, you become the perfect CONSUMER, the perfect Product.** 

**An obedient Slave fattened on Dopamine, engineered for profit, happily milking himself dry off of his finances and nutrients night and day.** 

**He does this under the mantra ""Live and let live"".**

**""As long as I am not hurting anyone, I can do whatever they want""**

**Even some long term retainers are trapped in Dopaminergic environments that offer artificial surges of dopamine preventing Sexual transmutation.**

 

# Automaticity + Dopamine | The Man Killing Combo

[This study and a 1000 other studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3462342/) show how addictions EAT AWAY YOUR BRAIN's ABILITY TO QUESTION THE ADDICTION ITSELF.

DOPAMINE ADDICTIONS WILL MAKE A PROPER SLAVE OUT OF YOU. 

# ""You will own nothing and still be happy.""  

# ~World Economic Forum (2016) 

Translation: 

***""We will strip you of ownership, keep you dependent on our systems for everything, and drug you with comfort and convenience AND you WILL mistake slavery for happiness.""***

The Technology is only getting started.

**YOU** **~~WILL~~** **ARE LOSING THE ABILITY TO QUESTION THE HABITS THEY ARE FORCING UPON YOU WHILE MAINTAINING PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.**

**DOPAMINE ADDICTION IS THE DISEASE THAT TELLS YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE IT.**

This is the reason why r/Semenretention does not have more members. 

Majority of men are in denial.

*- ""There's No scientific proof, no empirical evidence that SR works.""* 

*- ""Oh, its just placebo.""*

Without ever giving it a fair chance. Because porn has encroached upon their Prefrontal Cortex, their self-awareness, taken control of their higher order executive control like a parasite and tells them its okay to watch porn. 

Until the stars align and they find a woman ready to have sex with them and they cannot get it up when the time demands. At that moment, truth is laid bare. But it's too late.

Even us, long term retainers are guilty of self sabotage. We have our own vices. We write things off without giving them a fair chance. 

What most of us are scared of here is, **the Void.** 

We quit a bad habit and a **time void** appears. That void will ALWAYS be filled. 

If logic doesn’t choose how, YOUR LIMBIC BRAIN will. 

Majority of us just Fire one addiction and hire another. At the end we still end up paying.

Most of us here Never give Dopamine Fasting a chance. We write it off and say SR alone is good enough. 

Unbeknownst to them that Dopamine Retention + Semen Retention is the ultimate God Hack.



# REINFORCED BY ENVIRONMENT

***Now that we know that Automaticity is the PRIMARY driver of relapse.***

 **We need ot know how it is weaponized.** 

**-PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY:** 

**The dopamine trainer aka the Elites wear the cloak of anonymity, where will you point fingers if you don't know them? Who will you blame? If its overt psychological operation, you will be stand on Guard, you will rebel. If they keep a low profile with just Temptation ever-present, That gives you an illusion of choice. Only you are to blame.**



**-AVAILABILITY AND CONVENIENCE OF ONLY THE ADDICTIVE things:** 

 **like Caffeine, junk food is available in EVERY SINGLE TOWN no matter how small it is. Paying for stuff is easier and quick. One click and you are subscribed. One click and you can order stuff.**

**-FRICTIONLESS ACCESSIBILITY:** 

**Pay attention to how everything that's bad for you is frictionless, absolutely no barriers to impulsivity. Drive thru is only for junk food, alcohol, coffee, donuts and other trash not for Steamed Broccoli/Kale.** 

Pay attention to how everything around you is Sexualized to the point that YOU CANNOT BLOCK ALL FEMALES ON INSTAGRAM/TIK TOK. YOU HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS AND ADD a MILLION HASHTAGS to avoid watching any nudity on these apps.

THERE ARE NO 3rd-PARTY apps that help sort content according to gender and content. 

The only option remains is to give it up altogether.

>!They are even designing Women's clothing to be as perverse as possible. It is literally engineered to attract Male attention.!<

>!Never ever believe anyone who says ""I am wearing this for myself, to feel confident""!<

>!What does Confidence have to do with having your Breasts appear bigger than they are?!<

>!What does Confidence have to do with your waist appearing smaller than it actually is?!<

>!However, When a woman wears Push up bras, hides her acne behind make up, it's NOT insecure.!<

This disparity means there is a deep social programming that is aimed to harvest ONLY male attention.

**Behavior is the language of truth. Don't ever believe their words, only their actions.** 

This applies for self accountability too, Don't ever believe your own words, watch what you do. Keep a check on your time. Watch your ""Screen Uptime Activity"" and trust it more than your own words. 

**Past Behavior is a much better predictor than future expectation of behavior**  
  
**Past Behavior >>> Future Intent of Behavior**



# Solution:



After Covid-19, the company I worked for posted a 30% increase in average annual revenue.

I was in sales so obviously I was very happy until we had an annual financial meeting.

The analysts in the meeting basically said:

Statistically speaking, a huge 30% increase means an external factor has been applied to a data set forming an unprecedented result.

**A CHANGE OF 30% IS STATISTICALLY EXTRA ORDINARY AND NOT REPLICABLE UNDER THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL conditions. Our products were the same, the B2B and B2C model was the same, we did not do ANYTHING extra that would increase the revenue.**



**In layman's terms, UNLESS THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGES, THE PROBABILITY OF DURABLE CHANGE IS almost ZERO.** 

**YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULUS THAT ARE KEEPING YOU IN THE HABIT LOOP AND UPROOT IT FROM THE SOURCE.** 

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ADD ANYTHING TO FOCUS, YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THINGS TO FOCUS. CONSISTENCY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU ADD, IT IS UNMASKED AFTER YOU REMOVE ALL THE DIRT.** 

**When there is no choice other than to work on transmuting your sexual energy, consistency happens. You just have to deliberately block other choices.**



**Biologically: The neurological pathways have been reinforced for 10, 20, 30 years or more.** 

**These pathways are like river bed formed through water gushing and cutting rocks. It won't be reversed by mere intent.**

**Environmental Cues peppered all around us are designed to REINFORCE the release patterns. YOUR PHONE is the biggest threat to your biological imperative. It is ever present.**

**DURABLE CHANGE WITHOUT ALTERING THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT IS VERY RARE. IT TENDS TO ZERO in the world of Statistics.**

**IN GAMING TERMS: YOU GUYS NEED TO CHOP OFF ALL THE other side CHOICES IN THE DECISION TREE. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Put friction in the way of those choices. Strategize.**

The more barriers you set up between you and the addictive behavior the easier it will be to stick to that apparently boring project you were doing.

As your brain corrects your neurology, with time the boring things will becoming entertaining again.

Identify at least one dopamine source in your environment and get rid of it. It is costing you thousands of dollars, and tons of self confidence. It is feminizing you, making you inactive, unable to move, emasculating you. 

***30% change is actually more than enough to cause the snowball effect and take you places you would have never imagined. You can achieve ANYTHING you have EVER desired in your life.*** 

The only issue is The Horse comes before the cart. 

The SACRIFICE COMES BEFORE MANIFESTATION. 

That is the hidden covenant with God. 

Every temptation is a test in disguise, every pleasure you reject takes you closer to God and your deepest aspirations. 

Each temptation rejected transmutes into your Will Power. 

Each temptation accepted transmutes into unending temptations like the Hydra.

 I'm a professional residential house painter and I think I make good money. I take home like $125k a year. Self-employed sole proprietor of my business. 
I have a good life and enjoy myself. I have hobbys I'm passionate about, no wife, no kids, no mortgage.
Something about 3 months ago  where I reviewed my finances and was absolutely shocked at the amount I spent eating out and going to coffee shops.
 Since then I have been doing meal prepping, I have 30 meals in the freezer right now. I make my coffee at home, buying things in bulk for way cheaper (have a mini deep freeze), making lunch everyday. Stopping Amazon spending on random usless shit. Basically just thinking way more about every purchase I consider. 
 I was sitting on my couch did a little bit of research and ended up creating a wealth simple account and opening up a TSFA. Since then I have invested $17,500 all into VEQT. It has been quite motivating to see it grow. 
I have $250 a week being automatically invested into veqt and my plan is to dump a chunk in once in a while once i build my emergency fund up to $20,000, currently at $8,000. I have no debt other than my truck and make sure I pay my credit card balance every month. I didn't even know what my credit score was so I checked that and it said it was 852 and I did some research and I guess that's good?
My job is very physical but I see myself crawling around on roofs and up ladders well into my fifties making good money as I am fit and eat healthy. 
I guess I'm just wondering if it's too late for me to be able to comfortably retire in my 60s.
I don't really know what retirement looks like to me and what the world will look like in 35 years.
Buying a home isn't a goal of mine. I understand it as an investment, but my goal in life is to deal with less stress and responsibility. I'm hoping I can still retire comfortably while renting.

The pimples and eventual bald patches started I THINK when i was around 14. I had so much thick hair back then I didn’t really care. I think I would only have a few patches every year, but I’m not really sure. These patches most happen on the sides of my head and around the back. Since then, they’ve pretty much mostly all grown back I think.
I never noticed thinning of my hair and receding hairline really until I was around 17 or 18. That’s when i realized that my scalp would itch, my hair was falling out, it was thinning, and my hairline was receding. I also would still get pimples that itch and eventually turn into bald patches.
My parents made me go to the doctor when I was around 18 and they just said it was from stress and prescribed me a topical cream to grow the patch I had back, and i’m pretty sure it didn’t really work at all. They grow back eventually anyways for me mostly. 
I’m 20 now and it’s still the same. But now it’s getting to a point where I’m not the only one who notices it. 
Please help me. I want to grow my hair back and make my hair and scalp normal again so bad.
Some things i’ve noticed that make it worse I THINK are eating junk food and gluten. It might be placebo but i think it makes the itching and hair loss worse. 
I eat extremely clean for the most part, eating mostly meat and fruit and some veggies. I eat dairy occasionally and try to avoid grains and legumes mostly. I drink tea and coffee ocassionally, mostly tea. 
I have a reverse osmosis shower filter. 
Red light therapy i think seems to help speed up growing back the patches but that could possibly be placebo as well. 
Certain things like certain oils/shampoos I think break it out more i THINK.
I use a very clean shampoo and conditioner.

My only “health history” is that when I was a preteen/early teen, I had self-diagnosed malassezia folliculitis. I believe I had this because my symptoms were flesh colored bumps on the oily spots on my face (mostly forehead). it cleared up using Nizoral shampoo, but then it got used to the Nizoral and came back a little bit. I still have a little bit on my forehead sometimes but it’s not quite as bad. 
I’m wondering if the scalp pimples are fungal related as well? I’m not sure. But i’m not sure if Nizoral would work since I think my body has built a resistance to it. 

Please help me anyone🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼with remedies, cures, suggestions, or any possible diagnosis or idea what is causing all of this!!!!

Been a member for years but this is actually my first post.  
What I like about reddit is the authenticity, I don't have to put on a fake persona, so I come cap in hand with my truth.

Another startup, I've been at this one for a while, a ton of iterations and failures but this one is close to my heart. I guess I'm trying to channel a little childhood abandonment trauma into something useful. Sort of like Batman minus the billions, gadgets and vigilante beatings.. **My gut and data both say its the right time** the urge that won't die so hey.

Looking around, the world's a fucking mess right now:

Silicon Valley can't fix homelessness in their own backyard but wants to ""change the world""

Gen Z and alpha's future looks bleak as hell and they kinda no it.

Power and resources keep centralizing to the same handful of people

War is looking inevitable. I'm not even sure who were supposed to be fighting, is it the Russians, Chinese, Aliens or ourselves.

Then there AI, we'll get into that at some point.

But hey, we'll ""own nothing and be happy"" apparently

My favourite quote of all time and a statement that sums it all up is Dr. E.O. Wilson's:

# ""The real problem of humanity is we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology.""

It's perfect as it just sums the whole shitfest up. We're out of balance.

DLT Cafe is my humble attempt to try and shift the needle. Get us working together like ants instead of crabs in a bucket.

I don't have all the answers - nobody does, but I have a plan and I am certain of three things:

2. **If you don't set a destination you wont know where your going.**

I recently moved in with him after about 9 months and he’s already talking about marriage, he won’t let me pay for anything. He literally wants me to quit my job so I can travel with him since he travels for work, and he never holds anything over my head.

The thing is, yes he tries which im very appreciative but when hes giving me something/doing anything for me it’s almost like someone doing a nice thing for a stranger.

One thing that everyone knows about me, i love iced coffee. I never drink it hot, or black.

Twice now he has “surprised” me with a coffee from my favourite coffee shop, and brought me a hot black coffee. It’s just odd to me because I can tell you exactly what he orders when we go. My order everywhere is an iced caramel latte.. not super complicated.

It’s the same with food. In His defence not common for him to grocery shop, however the few times when he did he “grabbed snacks he thought I would like” and his picks for me were so far off it almost seemed like he purposely grabbed stuff I wouldn’t like.

One night he picked up dinner, told me not to cook. Came home with takeout, for some reason he got it without asking me what I wanted but we go there all the time and I always get the exact same thing… he brought me chicken Alfredo that night… I don’t like pasta, and I would never order it. His answer is “you like chicken” which is true, I always order chicken wings.

Maybe it’s not that huge of a deal, and I’m being picky but it’s just that I go out of my way to get/make him things I know he likes. He told me on our first date he wasn’t a fan of black pepper and I have been careful about how much pepper I used in everything I have ever cooked for him

I could tell you pretty much anything about him, what he orders at every restaurant. I know all his favourite snacks, drinks, clothing brands, etc.

All thirds are relatively consistent, but that’s what one wants from this buttered toast, honey, caramel and light woody offering.

I still remember the amount of joy I felt when we reconnected. When I saw your name pop up on my phone, when it said you had followed me back on Instagram. We hadn't seen each other in 2.5 years. On the 27th of March, 2025, we saw each other in person for the first time in those years. We got coffee and chatted for two hours, stopping only because we had to go to class. I remember you asking me so many questions about myself and how invested you were in me. I remember telling my friends I had gone on a date. I remember seeing their faces light up and how excited they were. How pretty they thought you were when they saw your Instagram account.

  
The next weeks were bliss. We went to a tulip festival. We went swing dancing every Tuesday and Wednesday night. We went out to a remote spot I had discovered earlier and watched the sun set on the last day of the school year. I missed you all summer and could only think of you.

  
But it was during that summer when I realized we would not work out in the long term. You were planning on moving east after graduation, I would be moving west. You wanted kids, I didn't. But (and I know this is so selfish) I could not bear waiting all summer just to not see you and get a hug and a kiss. We kept going for a whole month after you returned before I was able to muster enough courage to end things. 

  
When I did it, I had no clue how it would go. It seemed to go a lot better than I expected, but when I walked out of your house, instead of feeling relieved, I felt soul-crushing sadness. The moment I got home and laid down in my bed, I began to sob uncontrollably.

  
No one tells you how hard it is to go from best friends to strangers in a matter of seconds. No one tells you how much it sucks to lose someone who loves you because they *want* to love you, not because they have to. And no one tells you how much it sucks ending things with someone you care for deeply, not because you have fallen out of love with them, but because you know things won't work in the future and you don't want to keep wasting their time.

  
Farewell to the weekly dinners we'd have on Mondays, the times we would lay in bed and watch TV, the ""good morning! have a good day!"" texts, the ""good night, sweet dreams!"" texts, the voice memos we'd send talking about each other's days. Now, when I see you in class, instead of feeling unbridled joy, all I feel is deep sorrow.



Things will never be the same between us, but I will still think of you every day, and I still care about you so so much. You gave me so much happiness and I'm glad to have shared part of my life with you.",2,1758075010.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I read somewhere regarding (cooked/dry) beef adrenal supplements that they can mess you up.  If you stop taking them it can be dangerous.  I wonder if that's because the supplements contain some other substances or synthetic stimulants.

I am a YouTube enjoyer, or one could say social media addict, either way whatever I saw how people like tea, and I thought 'I've had tea, its ok but wtf are they all excited?'  Never gave it much thought but then a channel I sub, 'OTR Food and History', posted a '[History of Tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyc-vMdlfII)' video and after watching I had to try loose leaf 'brewed by hand' tea.

I thought I would try and see what the fuss was about.  So I journed to the 'jungleweb hell of consumerism propaganda' and bought some stuff (possibly the wrong stuff) that looks like what people use in the videos.

This [organic Japanese black tea](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RDLZB6X?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) said grown in Japan, and I thought hey I like Donkey Kong so I'll get this since he is from Japan as well.  A [cheap tea kettle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F62LMYNY?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) that allows specific temperature seemed better than an expensive one, just in case I hate the tea and only use it for poor over coffee I got the one with a spout that looks like a goose neck and reminds me of French people (poor over coffee is like pour over coffee but you keep pouring over and over because your poor).  French people drink coffee so I figured that goose neck made sense.

I also bought a [cheap little tea set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ38ML1N?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1), it looked so much bigger on the monitor but its this cute little teapot the size of a coffee mug and tiny little cups, and in retrospect they are the size of the tea sets in the YouTube vids of people enjoying tea.  So maybe the small size allows more flavor to escape?  Probably, I guess.

So I got the stuff off the 'jungleweb of shopping hell', and it arrived and I followed the instructions on the bag of tea leaves, which look likes dried leaves of some bush in the yard, but I guess that is what tea really is.  So put 2 teaspoons of the tea leaves in the little cute teapot, then water at 92c (which is like 191f) goes in, wait 2 and a half minutes, and HOLY !#$@#!#!!!! THIS IS SO $!#@#$@$!!!!! GOOD WTF?!?

The tea is fantastic, sweat not bitter, really surprising its not what I expected at all, far better actually very delicious.  It tastes like I added sugar but I did not.

WHY DON'T RESTURUANTS SERVE REAL TEA THIS IS SO DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING FROM A TEABAG?!?!?!?  I am sort of joking but also not, literally it is delicious and people would order this for enjoyment, but every time I ever had tea in a restaurant it was teabag tea, and probably because of that I rarely order it.

My friends say I’m selfless. My manager has a called me a go getter on multiple occasions. I however consider myself to be a quirky mess. I’m usually about 5 minutes late to every event I’m invited to with a coffee in hand. By 9:30am there is something on my shirt (coffee usually). I can’t ever find my phone and I lock my keys in my car weekly. My desk drawers are filled with junk from open enrollment 3 years ago because I might still need that paper I can get on the online portal chomps and that’s it bars. But I like every other hotdog lover I  turn my neon hot dog sign on, one button at a time. And I’m seeking someone who likes their life with a little bit of well intentioned chaos. 

I’m seeking someone who thinks the idea of drinking a pitcher of beer at the dive bar and taking over the TouchTunes with deep cuts of bands you definitely know aren’t played there ….ever, sounds like a fun date night. Doesn’t absolutely hate that I love hot dogs in an unironic non performative way. Understands that while I love the gym - that is not me saying I want to be gym buddies. I love concerts and have been to over 200+ and it’s important to me that you’re outgoing and enjoy events and such and can handle crowds. Bonus points for Midwest Emo lovers, wanna sit in my car and cry? I primarily watch football and baseball, but I think hockey is an absolute blast too, despite a lack of knowledge. I need someone who understands I have tattoos and will not be shocked to hear I got a new one that is more strange than last one. Someone who knows that I’ve never met a stranger, and I’ll talk to anyone and everyone. 

I will say what probably excludes me from otherwise good matches is that I don’t enjoy video games or anime. Neither of these interest me. I can deal with hobbyist gamers and anime enthusiasts - but I won’t watch you play or watch it with you. Not my jam. 

For me mutual attraction is NECESSARY and I will be honest if I don’t find you attractive as I assume, once you scroll, yes SCROLL, through my photos, you find me, I’ll tell you. I am honest. I am 5’6 for reference on the thicker side. Included photos of me full body, at the gym, no make up etc. https://imgur.com/a/BzXz3em

I’m not sure why I have to say this, but if your idea of a first message is to tell me you hate something I’ve said I love that won’t work for me. 
Ideally here’s what I’m seeking - a connection that starts friendly with mild flirting that we build off. You are ~26-40. You must indicate you read this post in someway shape or form. I don’t care what it is, you can tell me about the time your mom dropped you as a baby, you got lost at the zoo, or even your first concert, but for the love of god don’t just say “hey” or “hi” or I won’t respond.

Has Anyone in San Diego Actually Tried TimeLeft or 222.place?,"Okay so I'm 21 and basically spent the last few years perfecting the art of avoiding human interaction, but now I'm ready to rejoin society and have zero clue how to do it in San Diego. Like I moved here thinking I'd automatically become this cool social person who goes to sunset sessions at La Jolla and has beach bonfire plans, but turns out making friends as an adult in this city is actually impossible when you have the social skills of a houseplant. Everyone here seems to already have their established surf crews or their college friend groups from UCSD/SDSU, and I'm just... not in any of them.

I keep seeing ads for these apps like TimeLeft and [222.place](http://222.place) that supposedly match you with strangers for dinners or random meetups, and honestly it sounds both perfect and terrifying for someone like me. Perfect because I wouldn't have to figure out how to approach the intimidatingly chill people at bars in Gaslamp or Pacific Beach, terrifying because what if I just sit there awkwardly while everyone else effortlessly talks about hiking trails and craft breweries I've never heard of. Has anyone actually tried these apps in SD? Did you meet people who weren't just trying to get you to join their beach volleyball league, or was it just expensive small talk with military guys and yoga instructors? I'm tired of my only social interaction being with my coffee shop barista, but also scared I'll be the boring one at the table.

Has it gotten easier with time?,"I saw a post on another sub and it got me thinking about this. I’m curious. So I was diagnosed the beginning of this year and I’ve been figuring out what triggers my disorder. 

So far, it’s several things I enjoy. I know I need to give them up as I can’t have a healthy relationship with them- but it’s so hard.

I need to eat better, maintain a routine, and avoid both caffeine + alcohol/drugs. I simply cannot do those things and expect stability consistently. 

The idea of not doing these things sounds *so* boring. I want my morning coffee. I like a good drink and Taco Bell run. Stability is learning to embrace boredom (normalcy maybe?)- but it’s a grating feeling to me. I know it will take time to adjust but I almost feel like I’m not ready? 

It’s chicken vs egg. If I achieve stability via meds, will it be easier to give up these vices? Or is it changing my lifestyle (plus meds) will then positively reinforce itself? 

I guess I’m just wondering if this shit gets easier the longer you have it. I’m still learning what normal is for me. Thanks for reading my rant",2,1758074391.0,BipolarReddit,0,1.0,False

I’m gonna lose more weight… seems my only real option is medication. I do not have health insurance though I can sign up come November.

anyways, i luckily met a group of girls at orientation that i got along w well enough, and we made a gc and planned to meet up when classes started. the plans were pretty thought out, like going out for coffee and going to the zoo or smth as well. but now, classes started 3 was ago and nb has texted yet. i don’t want first semester to end and i haven’t made any friends, but i also can’t think of anything to text them about tbh. i also don’t wanna make it awkward if they’ve been talking without me or smth and i randomly pop up out of the blue. but maybe im overthinking idk. i just say that bc the last text sent was from me and nb responded. so i feel extra awkward.

edit: i but the bullet and asked how school has been going. thx for the advice, i just needed some reassurance that i wasn’t being a weirdo lol",1,1758074067.0,college,8,0.57,False

Not a full-blown gym rat, but I’m flirting with a six-pack. Give me a month or two and it’ll be official. 😂

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she’d probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

1nj0b37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stubhub/comments/1nj0b37/stubhub_sucks/,STUBHUB SUCKS,"Ah!  Fuck StubHub!!!!  You are NOT safe there!

Story time!  My brother passed away in March. I was in town cleaning out his apartment and getting his affairs in order. We always used to go to Phillies games together when I visited and we’d sit up in the same section every time. Section 244.  Row 1. Seats 8-9.

While I was there I was fucking wrecked. He was my best friend. And he died a senseless death, and he was too young. (Not an overdose for what it’s worth.) But I decided to treat myself because I’d never been to the home opener before so, that day I told myself I wasn’t going to his apartment at all, and I would enjoy the day in memory of him by going to the places we went and doing the things we did.

I went to Anthony’s in the Italian market for iced coffee and a donut. I went to Delassandros for a cheesesteak. And I went to the home opener. I got to the stadium early so I could watch all the ceremonies and everything. I got to my seat right away, and sure enough, someone was in my seat.

Long story short, yep. We both got sold the SAME ticket. I bought mine on StubHub. So I immediately reached out to StubHub via chat, who told me to talk to ballpark security. So I talked to ballpark security and through conversation and resolution I told the guy I was there by myself, and that there was a couple together, one of which has my seat. I didn’t wanna have to sit next to the other one, you know how shitty that would be for both of us?  Security verified they were the same seats. They gave me a pop out chair in one of the handicap spots. I got emotional. They asked if I was okay and I just explained my brother passed away and I was here for a day off of dealing with it. So you know what they did? Got me another chair. An empty one. For my brother. Small but very kind gesture that meant a lot to me.

StubHub guarantees their seats but you know what?  Apparently I was supposed to call them directly. Even though the live chat said to talk to park security, I was supposed to resolve it with them, at the time it happened. I tried filing a customer service complaint and they refused to do a single thing for me. I even sent them screen shots and emailed them the text thread and everything. Didn’t matter.

Fuck StubHub in the ass with a flaming cactus. They double sold my seat and didn’t do a damned thing about it and tried to blame ME for it for not reaching out to them during the event.

I had a large cup of coffee this morning. I generally don’t drink caffeine as it gives me crazy anxiety. I am sure the coffee shop gave me non decaf coffee today. My friend (who drinks coffee a lot with no problem, experienced a lot of jitters with it). I don’t know how much caffeine was in that drink but it had to be a lot. 

I’ve thought a few times over the last 6 months that I could be hypomanic sometimes. Lasts about a day, but randomly feeling amazing, risky, very talkative, etc.  I have experienced depressive episodes, but I always thought it was seasonal with the very occasional non seasonal episode.  

Anyways, I strongly believe the caffeine today induced some hypomanic episode if that’s possible. The feeling was very familiar, but I was driving fast, talking fast, very irritable and impatient, but also very happy and feeling amazing. Looking back at today, it didn’t feel real and I felt out of my body. 

So I’m just wondering, could bipolar 1 be something that fits my description? Or is it the combination of my Prozac, buspar, and a lot of caffeine that made me feel like this? Could caffeine even induce a manic episode? ",1,1758073547.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

Story time!  My brother passed away in March 2025. I was in Philadelphia cleaning out his apartment and getting his affairs in order. We always used to go to Phillies games together when I visited and we’d sit up in the same section every time. Section 244.  Row 1. Seats 8-9.

While I was there I was fucking wrecked. He was my best friend. And he died a senseless death, and he was too young. (Not an overdose for what it’s worth.) But I decided to treat myself because I’d never been to the home opener before so, that day I told myself I wasn’t going to his apartment at all, and I would enjoy the day in memory of him by going to the places we went and doing the things we did.

I went to Anthony’s in the Italian market for iced coffee and a donut. I went to Delassandros for a cheesesteak. And I went to the home opener. I got to the stadium early so I could watch all the ceremonies and everything. I got to my seat right away, and sure enough, someone was in my seat.

Long story short, yep. We both got sold the SAME ticket. I bought mine on StubHub. So I immediately reached out to StubHub via chat, who told me to talk to ballpark security. So I talked to ballpark security and through conversation and resolution I told the guy I was there by myself, and that there was a couple together, one of which has my seat. I didn’t wanna have to sit next to the other one, you know how shitty that would be for both of us?  Security verified they were the same seats. They gave me a pop out chair in one of the handicap spots. I got emotional. They asked if I was okay and I just explained my brother passed away and I was here for a day off of dealing with it. So you know what they did? Got me another chair. An empty one. For my brother. Small but very kind gesture that meant a lot to me.

StubHub guarantees their seats but you know what?  Apparently I was supposed to call them directly. Even though the live chat said to talk to park security, I was supposed to resolve it with them, at the time it happened. I tried filing a customer service complaint and they refused to do a single thing for me. I even sent them screen shots and emailed them the text thread and everything. Didn’t matter.

Fuck StubHub in the ass with a flaming cactus. They double sold my seat and didn’t do a damned thing about it and tried to blame ME for it for not reaching out to them during the event. I shit you not. Awful experience overall. 0/10 stars would not recommend and I will tell this story and shit on them every opportunity I get.

Hey there, I’m a 33 year old guy from Southeast Michigan. I’d like to meet a woman who’s also looking for something genuine, friendship first with the possibility of it naturally turning into more if the vibe is right.

A little about me: I’m 5’10”, athletic build, brown hair, green eyes, and I’ve been told I have a laid back but fun personality. I love the outdoors, camping, hiking, or just sitting by a fire, but I’m equally happy with a good book, a great show, or sharing coffee and conversation. Sarcasm, laughter, and physical affection go a long way with me.

I’m not into games or drama, just hoping to connect with someone who’s kind, fun, and knows what she wants. Whether it stays as a solid friendship or grows into something more, I’m open to seeing where things go.

If any of this clicks with you, feel free to reach out, I’d love to chat.",2,1758073222.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1nj055b,https://i.redd.it/em34vny1qmpf1.jpeg,Chip,"Chip as Oliver's Assistant 

Context: Chip is currently 15. Thanks to his genetics he became stronger than even Zip with a few pretty cool powers like flying, fire breathing, invulnerability, and other dragon abilities.

Since Zip joined Abbie's harem he has held a big grudge against Abbie.

Chip never liked Abbie since he was a child, he always preferred Edward as his sister's partner since he considered him a brother and even Oliver seemed like a better partner than Abbie, but when he saw that Zip left with Abbie, he started calling Abbie in his head ""The stupid guy who stole my older brother Edward's girlfriend.""

Also for the same reason he held a grudge against Zip and became rebellious, one day while walking aimlessly because he did not want to go to the house where Abbie lived and her harem he found Oliver who was investigating to find Abbie's house.

When he found him, he ran to hug Oliver since he hadn't seen him in 7 years and he really missed him. Oliver hugged Chip back since he also missed him a lot and the two cried a little when they met.

Oliver took Chip to have a coffee and make up for the lost years, there he told him everything, from how Alice had deceived him and how Zip made Edward die to be with Abbie, Chip upon hearing that, his resentment turned into hatred without limits, now he wanted to kill Abbie and Zip for that.

Oliver told him about the Kronos project and Chip agreed to join, thus becoming Oliver's spy.

Chip tells Oliver all the powers that Zip, Alice and the other members of the Harem are going to develop so that Oliver can improve the Omnidroid to be immune to it. Chip also took several demons to Oliver's island.

So Chip became Oliver's right-hand man and the perfect spy for the Kronos project.",5,1758073136.0,FPEseries,0,1.0,False

# 🌍 1. Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card – The Balanced All-Rounder

https://preview.redd.it/z9ujntukpmpf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9fbbded26b4ba5a54eb13ca1a44c78bd8691a0f

This is the one that got me into the points game. It’s a **$95 annual fee** card, but the value you get is often worth every penny — especially if you travel a bit and want flexibility.

**What you get:**

* **75,000 bonus points** after you spend $5,000 in the first 3 months.
* **5x points on travel** (airfare, hotels, car rentals, etc.) and **3x points on dining**.
* You can **transfer points 1:1** to major partners like **United, Southwest, Hyatt, and Marriott**, which makes this card a powerhouse for those who want to earn points in the right airline or hotel programs.
* The **Points Boost** system is a game-changer. When you book through Chase’s travel portal, you can get **1.5 to 1.75 cents per point** on select flights and hotels. That’s way above the average 1.25 cents most travel portals offer.

**When it makes sense:**

* You travel 4-6 times a year and are okay with booking via the Chase portal.
* You like the idea of earning points across **multiple travel categories** — not just flights.
* You want a **companion card** that works well with other Chase cards (like the Freedom Unlimited®), letting you consolidate rewards in one system.

**Break-even point:** If you spend $5,000 in the first 3 months, you’ll get the **75,000 bonus**, which is like $750 in travel value. For ongoing value, you’d want to spend at least **$40,000 a year** to make the annual fee worthwhile, but with the 5x on travel and 3x on dining, that’s totally doable for a young professional with a modest travel budget.

# ✈️ 2. Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card – The Lounge Lover’s Pick

https://preview.redd.it/lytfyttmpmpf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=26e5a2ecb54b493bfe95565a66719852bdc322c2

If you’re into airport lounges and want a high-value travel card that’s a bit easier to understand than some of the competition, the Capital One Venture X is a top contender.

**What you get:**

* **75,000 bonus miles** after you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months.
* **2x miles on all purchases** — which is a solid base rate.
* **Airport lounge access** (you can use any of their lounges globally).
* **$750 annual travel credit** to use on flights, hotels, car rentals, etc.
* Miles are **transferable** to partners like **Delta, United, and Alaska Airlines**, which can boost their value if you know where to redeem them.

**When it makes sense:**

* You travel **at least 2-3 times a year**, and you want **lounge access** to make the airport experience more bearable.
* You’re comfortable **booking travel through the Capital One portal**, which is well-designed and offers good value.
* You don’t want a complicated card but still want **high-value miles** and **travel credits**.

**Break-even point:** The $395 annual fee is offset by the **$750 travel credit** alone. If you book a $500 flight and a $250 hotel stay, that credit pays for itself in a single trip. Plus, the 2x miles on everything means even your daily coffee or gas stops count toward your rewards.

# 🍽️ 3. American Express® Gold Card – The Foodie’s Dream

https://preview.redd.it/8z3sq3iopmpf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed2817ad502b174daf378bb915101c177a972713

This one is for people who **love to eat** — and I mean *really* love to eat. It’s not just a travel card, it’s a **dining and grocery rewards beast**.

**What you get:**

* **100,000 Membership Rewards Points** after you spend $6,000 in the first 6 months.
* **4x points at restaurants** (up to $50,000 in dining per year).
* **4x points at U.S. supermarkets** (up to $25,000 in groceries).
* **$120 annual dining credit** (covers things like Uber Eats, Grubhub, and even restaurant reservations).
* Points can be **transferred** to travel partners like **British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, and Emirates**.

**When it makes sense:**

* You’re a **big eater** — even if you’re eating at home or ordering delivery, this card rewards that.
* You **shop for groceries** a lot and want to **earn 4x on those purchases**.
* You like the idea of **offsetting the annual fee** with dining credits and bonus categories.

**Break-even point:** With the **$325 annual fee**, you’ll need to spend a decent amount to get the most out of it. If you spend **$10,000 a year**, and 50% of that is on dining and groceries, you can earn **$1,200 in value** from points alone. Add in the **$120 dining credit**, and you’re already past the cost of the card.

# 💳 4. Chase Freedom Unlimited® – The No-Fee Travel-Backed Cash Back Card

https://preview.redd.it/vrlztmhqpmpf1.png?width=315&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad5cdb21081c8996e75652c80028b8222abed90a

This one is perfect for those who want to **earn value without an annual fee** and still get **solid travel rewards**.

**What you get:**

* **$200 cash back bonus** after you spend $500 in the first 3 months.
* **5% cash back on travel** booked through Chase.
* **3% cash back at restaurants and drugstores**.
* **1.5% cash back on all other purchases** — no cap, no limit.
* Points are **transferable** to Chase travel partners, and you can **combine them** with other Chase cards.

**When it makes sense:**

* You’re **new to travel rewards** and want a **no-fee card** to start with.
* You spend a **lot on everyday purchases** and want **1.5% back on everything**.
* You **travel occasionally** but want to **earn 5% on flights and hotels**.

**Break-even point:** The **$200 bonus** is easy to reach if you spend $500 in the first 3 months. After that, if you spend **$10,000 a year**, you’ll get **$150 in cash back** from the 1.5% rate — which means it’s a great option for **low- to mid-level spenders** who don’t want to pay an annual fee.

# 🧠 How to Choose Based on Your Spending & Goals

Let’s say you spend **$4,000/month** and travel **5 times a year**. Here’s a quick breakdown of potential value:

|Card|Annual Value (Est.)|Annual Fee|Net Value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Chase Sapphire Preferred|$1,200+ (points + transfer value)|$95|$1,105+|
|Capital One Venture X|$1,500+ (miles + lounge + travel credit)|$395|$1,105+|
|AmEx Gold|$1,200+ (points + dining credit)|$325|$875+|
|Chase Freedom Unlimited|$1,800 (1.5% on all purchases)|$0|$1,800|

So if you’re all about **maximizing cash back** and don’t want to pay fees, Freedom Unlimited is your go-to. If you want **points with transfer value**, go for the **Chase Sapphire Preferred**. If **lounge access** and **dining rewards** are high on your list, the **AmEx Gold** is tough to beat.

# 🎯 Strategic Approval Tips

* **Chase Sapphire Preferred** is best for people with **good credit** (670+). If you’re new to credit, build up with a basic card first.
* **Capital One Venture X** is more forgiving on credit scores and could be a good fit if you’re a **consistent spender** but not sure about the Chase system.
* **AmEx Gold** is a bit pickier about income and spending history. If you're a **young professional with a steady income**, you might qualify.

# 🧩 Maximizing Your Card

Let’s say you pick the **Sapphire Preferred** — here’s how to get the most out of it:

1. **Hit the $5,000 spending goal** in the first 3 months. That gives you 75,000 points (like $750 in value).
2. **Book through Chase** for flights and hotels. That’s where the **Points Boost** magic happens.
3. **Transfer points** to United or Hyatt for a **1.5x value boost**.
4. **Use the 5x on travel** for things like flights, car rentals, and even parking at the airport.
5. **Combine with Chase Freedom Unlimited** if you want a no-fee card for everyday spending and still use the same points system.

# 🚀 Final Thoughts

If you’re a young professional with a growing income and some travel aspirations, the **Chase Sapphire Preferred** is a smart, long-term investment. But if you're all about dining and groceries, the **AmEx Gold** is a lifestyle match. And if you want to avoid fees but still get travel rewards, **Chase Freedom Unlimited** is a solid pick.",1,1758073047.0,BONCredit,0,1.0,False

She reported her day to me (I’m getting coffee, I’m eating lunch, I’ve had 7 phone calls at work, etc.) But she built up the frequency with time and there were so many things that demanded my immediate attention that I never pulled these fleeting annoyances to the forefront of my mind. And I wondered if I was being fair. I never want to be that friend who has no time for people just cuz I’m going through something. Plus, I’m sure I’m annoying at times, too. So, I tried to be enagaging but the more time went on and the more vulnerable I became as traumatic events and health issues unfolded, the more she flooded me with minutia.

Attempts to set boundaries or shift the dynamic went nowhere. If confronted, she’d play the victim. When my life got especially heavy this year- declining health, a death in the family, a cancer scare- she listened less and talked more. Her “support” was canned (“I’m sorry, that sucks”) while she cycled through the same repetitive topics and fantasies, like stating we wanted to live together despite me saying no many times. Every time she'd bring it up, it was like I'd never said no before. It sometimes feels like talking to an NPC. I also noticed she had this habit of conflating our identities even though we’re not the same kind of person and don’t even look alike. It feels like she lives in some internal delusion and I’m just a character in her fantasy that she projects onto.

Two weeks ago, I finally snapped after she ignored my need for rest after a biopsy- a procedure she showed no real care or concern for. She kept texting me random stuff and I didn’t respond. So, she asked how I was and I told her I was in pain and needed rest. She immediately sent a barrage of texts and photos about her day as though she was just waiting for me to wake up and respond so she could flood into my phone and mind with her own stuff. I told her she was self-absorbed and went into detail about why I was done. To be clear, this was not the first and only warning. I’d been pulling back for some time and had told her I needed more space in my life. But the more I took space, the more she attempted to occupy it with conversations becoming more and more one-sided until I was receiving ever increasing details that were increasingly banal and unnecessary (i.e. telling me details about going to the bathroom!). I started to realise it was deliberate.

Since pulling back, I feel like a fog has lifted. She’s already trying to push us back into old patterns, repeating behaviors I directly called out. I feel I’ve given her more attention and patience than she ever gave me. But she’s pushing to talk and a part of me wonders: do I owe her a final chance to respond, or is it fair to just disengage?",1,1758072584.0,u_Complex_Vermicelli83,0,1.0,False

I give up. I’m taking my car to a new mechanic Friday to let the professionals handle it.

I’ve had this noise for months and my old mechanic (saw him twice in the last 6 months) said he couldn’t find anything and to “wait until it gets worse.” That didn’t sit right with me, so I went down the rabbit hole myself. A lot of people said sway bar end links, so I replaced the driver side where I hear it the most. No luck. I also ruined my OEM ones in the process and now have MOOG links that need to be greased.

At this point, I just want answers. I’ll post the pics/videos I took, and if someone guesses the cause right I’ll send you $5 for a beer or coffee (if that’s allowed here). Hopefully by this weekend I’ll finally know what’s going on.

PS: Some of the rubber joints look wet in the pictures because I sprayed silicone lubricant on them — there weren’t any leaky boots when I started.

서울에 아늑하고 비 오는 토요일이 찾아왔다. 좋은 책과 따뜻한 음료를 손에 들고 숨겨진 공간에서 시간을 보내기에 완벽한 날이었다. 기숙사에서 아사는 바로 그렇게 하고 있었다. 그녀는 휴대폰으로 Weverse를 스크롤하며 창문을 두드리는 빗소리에 귀 기울였다. 그녀는 방금 소설을 끝냈고, 이제 어떤 책을 읽을지 고민하는 전통적인 딜레마에 직면해 있었다. 그때 아이디어가 떠올랐다.

""아아, 다음에는 뭐 읽지?"" 그녀는 손끝으로 화면을 빠르게 넘기며 타이핑을 했다. ""난 막혔어! 너희들 도와줄 수 있어? 📚""

그녀는 자신의 TBR(읽을 책 목록)에 있는 세 권의 책을 가지고 투표를 만들었다:

**내 읽을 목록의 다음 책은?**

·       **Sweet Bean Paste**

·       **Convenience Store Woman**

·       **The Travelling Cat Chronicles**

응답은 거의 즉시 쏟아졌다. 그녀는 **Convenience Store Woman**과 **The Travelling Cat Chronicles**가 치열하게 경합하는 모습을 보며 웃었다. 그것은 그녀의 가장 친한 친구들로 가득 찬 방에 있는 것처럼 익숙하고 편안한 혼잡함이었다. 댓글들은 팬들이 자신의 의견과 응원의 메시지를 나누는 것이었다.

“‘The Travelling Cat Chronicles’ 진짜 좋아요, 아사! 휴지를 준비하세요 😭,” 한 팬이 썼다.

“‘Convenience Store Woman’ 너무 좋았어요—너무 독특해요! 즐기세요!” 또 다른 팬이 댓글을 달았다.

아사가 익숙한 사용자 이름들을 스크롤하면서, 한 개의 새로운 댓글이 눈에 띄었다. 그것은 단순한 댓글이었지만 다른 댓글들과는 달랐다. 투표 옵션 중 하나를 고르는 대신, 팬은 완전히 새로운 책을 추천했다.

""이 책을 대신 읽어봐요,"" 팬이 썼고, 그 뒤에는 일본어로 된 문장이 따라왔다.

**「私たちは誰もが何らかの形で道に迷っていますが、おそらく、それが私たちが家への道を見つける方法なのです…」**

Weverse에서의 투표는 이제 먼 울림처럼 들렸다. 즐겁고 디지털한 소음이었지만 그녀는 그것을 온전히 들을 수 없었다. 선택지들—**Sweet Bean Paste**, **Convenience Store Woman**, **The Travelling Cat Chronicles**—은 마치 다른 사람의 선택처럼 느껴졌다. 그것은 가벼운 문학적 논쟁에 시간을 보낼 수 있는 소녀의 책 목록 같았다. 하지만 이제, 다른 종류의 이야기가 펼쳐지고 있었고, 그 이야기는 그녀가 등장인물인 이야기였다. 그것은 위로의 읽을 거리가 아니었다.

작고 조용한 슬픔이 그녀의 마음에 서서히 스며들기 시작했다. 그것은 이름을 붙일 수 없고 떨쳐낼 수 없는 느낌이었다. 작은 것들에서 그것은 나타났다: 그녀의 발걸음이 조금씩 어긋나 보였던 공연, 그녀가 늘 잘 부르던 음에서 목소리가 갈라진 녹음 세션, 아무리 피곤해도 잠이 오지 않던 밤. 각 싸움은 바늘처럼 작은 상처였지만, 하나씩 쌓일수록 압박감은 점점 커졌다.

그녀는 그 책을 찾아야 했다. 그 생각은 갑자기 절박하고 긴급한 필요처럼 느껴졌다. 말할 수 없는 불안 속에서 그녀를 붙잡아주는 유일한 앵커였다. 팬의 그 한 줄은 단지 아름다웠던 것이 아니었다. 그것은 그녀에게 유일하게 진짜처럼 느껴진 것이었다. 그것은 이 ‘길 잃은’ 느낌이 영원히 지속되지 않을 것이라는 약속이었고, 그 ‘집’을 찾을 수 있다는 메시지였다.

그녀는 팬의 원래 댓글에 답을 남겼다. 책 제목이나 이름, 그 무엇이라도 그녀를 이끌어줄 수 있는 무엇이라도. 한 시간이 지나고, 두 시간이 지나갔다. 그녀는 반복해서 휴대폰을 확인하며, 비어 있는 알림을 확인할 때마다 마음이 조금씩 가라앉았다. 마침내 같은 팬의 새 댓글이 나타났다. 그 댓글은 책 제목이 아니었다. 그것은 하나의 단서였다.

“고요함 속에서 멜로디를 찾아보세요. 구석구석에 조용한 공간과 볶은 콩의 향기가 있는 곳.”

그것은 퍼즐 같았고, 빵 부스러기 같은 단서였다. 커피숍.

아사는 그곳이 정확히 어디인지 알았다. 그곳은 기숙사에서 멀지 않은 작은 숨겨진 카페였고, 그녀와 다른 멤버들이 가끔 도시의 소음을 피해 찾는 곳이었다. 다음 날 오후, 모자와 마스크를 써서 사람들 속에 섞이려 했지만, 혼자서 그곳을 나갔다. 카페는 그녀가 기억하는 그대로였다: 부드러운 재즈가 흐르고, 진한 커피 향이 가득하며, 조용하고 소박한 분위기였다. 그녀는 주위를 둘러보았지만, 무엇을 찾고 있는지 알 수 없었다. 카운터 옆 작은 게시판에서 그것을 보았다. 지역 밴드 공연과 고양이 입양 공고 사이에 작은 종이 쪽지가 있었다.

“세 번째 선반의 초록색 책 아래를 확인해보세요. 당신을 기다리고 있어요.”

그녀는 구석의 작은 책장으로 걸어갔다. 손끝으로 책등을 따라가다가 그것을 찾았다: 낡은 초록색 책이었다. 조심스럽게 책을 들어 올리자, 약속한 대로 새로운 종이 쪽지가 나왔다.

“다음 단서는 별이 떨어지는 곳, 소원이 이루어지는 곳에 있어요. 조금 늦었지만, 진심을 담아.”

유성. 소원. 그 문장은 혼란스러웠고, 조금 늦은 느낌이었다. 그 의미가 무엇인지 전혀 알 수 없었다. 그녀는 또 다른 단서나 쪽지를 찾으려고 했지만, 아무것도 발견할 수 없었다. 며칠 후, 그녀는 Weverse, 알림, 그리고 그 커피숍을 확인했다. 팬은 더 이상 존재하지 않았고, 그들의 계정은 침묵을 지켰다. 몇 주가 지나갔고, 새로운 단서는 나타나지 않았다. 빵 부스러기들은 끊겼고, 아사는 반쯤 끝난 보물찾기와 풀지 못한 퍼즐을 남겨두고, 그리워하는 책은 손이 닿지 않는 곳에 있었다.

몇 주가 지나면서, 조용하고 답답한 통증이 찾아왔다. 아사는 종종 휴대폰을 멍하니 바라보며 팬으로부터 온 마지막 메시지, ""별""과 ""소원""에 관한 암호 같은 단서를 반복해서 떠올렸다. Weverse에서의 투표는 오래 전에 잊혀졌고, 그 자리를 차지한 것은 이제 막다른 길로 끝난 이 단 하나의 퀘스트였다. 그녀는 그 커피숍을 수없이 지나쳤다. 그곳의 익숙한 상점을 볼 때마다 한 번의 희미한 희망이 깜빡였고, 그것은 곧 사라졌다. 처음 이 길을 걷게 만든 싸움은 팬의 사라짐 속에서 점점 더 크게 느껴졌다. 그녀는 이제 그 어느 때보다 더 길을 잃은 기분이었다.

어느 날 저녁, 늦은 연습을 마친 후, 아사는 사진 갤러리를 스크롤하며 게시할 사진을 찾고 있었다. 몇 주 전, 특히 성공적인 컴백 무대 후 찍은 그룹 사진에서 멈췄다. 그 사진의 배경에는 큰 디지털 광고판이 떠 있었고, 그 중 하나는 유명한 보석 브랜드의 캠페인 광고였다. 그 이미지는 하나의 섬세한 목걸이를 보여주었고, 그 아래에는 이런 문구가 적혀 있었다: “Make a wish on the Morning Star.”

그 문구는 마치 전기 충격처럼 그녀를 울렸다. 별이 떨어지고, 소원이 이루어진다. ""아침 별""은 유성처럼 떨어지는 별이 아니라, 새벽 직전에 보이는 금성, 즉 ""모닝 스타""였다. 그리고 그 단서가 ""조금 늦었다""고 말했었다. 이제 그녀는 기억해냈다: 그들의 컴백은 자정이 지난 직후, 새로운 하루의 시작과 함께 이루어졌던 것이다. ""모닝 스타""가 나타났다.

갑자기 퍼즐의 조각들이 맞춰졌다. 그 단서는 물리적인 위치나 문자 그대로의 별에 관한 것이 아니었다. 그것은 브랜드 이름이었다. 팬은 그녀에게 보석 브랜드와 연관된 장소에서 책을 찾아보라고 말하고 있었다. 하지만 어디서? 그 브랜드는 모든 곳에 매장이 있었다.

다음 날, 일정에 잠깐의 여유가 생긴 아사는 다시 한 번 변장을 하고 나갔다. 그녀는 플래그십 매장으로 가는 것이 너무 뻔하게 느껴져, 대신 조용한 동네에 위치한 작은, 덜 알려진 지점에 가기로 결심했다. 그녀의 불안은 말로 표현할 수 없는 채로 무겁게 느껴졌고, 그 책을 찾는 일이 그녀를 지탱하는 유일한 것처럼 느껴졌다. 그녀는 부티크에 들어갔고, 세련된 유리 진열장을 스캔했지만, 아무것도 발견할 수 없었다. 책도, 암호 같은 쪽지도 없었다. 실망감은 익숙한 둔한 아픔처럼 느껴졌다.

그녀는 부티크를 떠나 근처의 작은 공원 벤치에 앉아 생각을 정리하려 했다. 고개를 숙이고 다시 한 번 단서들을 떠올리며 놓친 세부사항이 있을지 고민했다. 그때, 부드러운 소리로 무언가가 그녀 옆에 떨어졌다. 그녀는 고개를 들었고, 그녀가 벤치를 앉고 있던 사람에게 실수로 부딪혔음을 알게 되었다.

""아, 죄송해요,"" 그녀는 마스크로 목소리가 흐려져서 말했다.

""괜찮아요,"" 부드러운 목소리가 답했다. ""저도 딴 생각하고 있었어요.""

그녀 옆에 앉은 소녀는 책을 들고 있었다. 얇고 어두운 표지의 책이었다. 아사는 눈이 커지며 그것을 즉시 알아차렸다. 그 책의 제목은 영어로 되어 있었지만, 표지에는 그동안 그녀를 괴롭혔던 바로 그 문장이 아름답게 흐르는 글씨로 새겨져 있었다.

**「私たちは誰もが何らかの形で道に迷っていますが、おそらく、それが私たちが家への道を見つける方法なのです…」**

소녀는 궁금한 듯 그녀를 바라보다가, 책을 내려다보았다. 아사가 그 문구를 보고 놀란 표정을 짓고 있다는 것을 알았던 것이다.

""혹시… 이 책을 찾고 있었나요?"" 소녀가 부드럽게 물었다. ""Weverse에서 투표를 봤어요. 이 문구를 정말 좋아하는 것 같더라고요.""

아사의 심장이 뛰기 시작했다. 그 소녀는 단순한 사람이 아니었다. 그녀는 팬이었다. 아사는 깊게 숨을 쉬며 손이 살짝 떨리는 것을 느꼈다. 말할 필요가 없었다. 소녀는 이미 알고 있었다.

소녀의 얼굴에 작은 미소가 떠올랐다. 그녀는 아사의 마스크를 벗기려 하지 않았고, 사진을 찍거나 사인을 요구하지도 않았다. 그녀는 그저 책을 아사에게 내밀었다.

""이 책을 공유하고 싶었어요,"" 그녀가 말했다. ""이 책이 필요할 것 같았어요.""

아사는 조심스럽게 책을 받아 들었다. 끝났다. 보물찾기는 매장 안에서 끝난 것이 아니었다. 그것은 조용한 공원 벤치에서, 간단한 우정의 행동으로 끝난 것이었다. 소녀는 아사가 겪고 있던 고통을 알지 못했지만, 그 단 한 줄의 문장에 대한 공감으로, 그녀는 아사에게 평온의 열쇠를 건넸다.

""고마워요,"" 아사가 속삭였다. 눈에 눈물이 고였다. ""정말 고마워요.""

소녀는 그저 미소 지었다. ""언젠가 이 책에 대해 이야기할 수 있으면 좋겠어요. 급할 거 없어요.""

그리고 그 순간, 부드러운 오후 햇살 아래에서, 새로운 종류의 우정이 시작되었다. 그것은 명성과 찬사가 아니라, 때로 우리가 찾고 있는 답이 책 속이 아니라, 그것을 나눠줄 준비가 된 사람들 속에 있다는 조용한 공감으로 시작된 우정이었다.

One of the Tinkerbats takes over and kicks Risky Boots off the ship, becoming the new owner. Now Risky must ask Shantae for help to become queen of the seven seas again (although Shantae asks him not to try to invade Scuttle Town again for a long time in return).

I remember Tinkerbat's design was taller than the average Tinkerbat and had a yellow mouth (something like the pumpkins' mouths on Halloween).

Rottytops ran out of coffee and is now looking for brains. This is the one I remember the least (I only remember one scene where someone stupid decided to put her on a guillotine).

Risky Boots thinks of a new way to steal. the gold of Scuttle Town without that annoying half-genius ruining her plans, then she has an idea (more discreet and less direct than going directly to loot all of Scuttle Town), she decides to take an alter ego and pretend to be a tourist passing through Scuttle Town and opens a casino (which is actually rigged so that no one wins anything and always loses), Shantae suspects at first that it could be a plan by Risky Boots, so she decides to investigate further and prove her point",3,1758071871.0,Shantae,1,0.67,False

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. CHAWLA OUTPOST - DAY**

A desolate landscape of ochre dust and jagged rock formations stretches under a bruised violet sky. Distant, the gas giant OLIVAS hangs like a colossal, bruised eye.

Perched amidst this stark beauty is a compact but well-fortified OUTPOST. Solar panels glint, and a single HABITAT module hums faintly.

Inside the habitat, LEONIDAS ""LEO"" S (40s, lean, with eyes that have seen too much) attempts to relax. He’s surrounded by stacks of well-worn data-slates and physical magazines – relics of a bygone era. He sips from a steaming mug, the air thick with the smell of recycled coffee.

The recent operations – the ERS *Comfort*'s harrowing mission and the ongoing shadow war with the Watchtower – have left their mark. R&R is a concept Leo struggles with, but he's trying.

He picks up a vintage issue of ""Ship and Pilots,"" its holographic cover crackling with age. He runs a thumb over the worn edges, searching for inspiration, a spark for a new project, a different kind of weapon in his clandestine war.

He flips through pages, past gleaming luxury yachts and industrial freighters, until an image catches his eye. A sleek, almost predatory vessel.

**CLOSE UP - MAGAZINE PAGE**

The headline reads: ""FREELANCER II: Lindan Engineering's Agile Phantom."" The accompanying article boasts of its unparalleled maneuverability and advanced, though ultimately unproven, stealth capabilities.

Leo's brow furrows in concentration as he devours the specs, the history, the promise of the design. The gentle hum of the habitat, the warmth of his coffee, the rhythmic turning of pages… it all lulls him. His eyes flutter, the words on the page blurring into abstract shapes.

The magazine slips from his grasp, his head tilting to rest against the cool metal of the habitat wall. He drifts.

**DISSOLVE TO:**

**EXT. UNKNOWN LANDING PAD - DAWN (DREAM)**

The same desolate landscape, but the outpost is different, grander. A massive, sleek starship rests on a landing pad, its dark hull reflecting the nascent light of a twin sun. It is a vessel of unfamiliar design, yet it possesses a certain menacing elegance.

LEO (DREAM) steps out of a habitat door, his hand instinctively going to the heavy pistol holstered at his hip. His eyes narrow, scanning the barren horizon, then the ship. No alarms, no movement. Just the silent, imposing craft.

He moves with a hunter's caution, ascending the gangway ramp. The metal groans softly under his boots. He reaches the top, the ship's main hatch already ajar, invitingly dark. He peers inside. Three decks.

**INT. UNKNOWN SHIP - DECK 1 (DREAM)**

Leo moves into the ship's cavernous landing bay. It's a HOPE TECH DEKZON HOPE-4X LANDING BAY FORE, its aft entry system to the starboard side. The engineering is pristine, the air smelling of ozone and new metal.

From the landing bay, a STROUD PREMIUM EDITION (SPE) 2X1 BRIG FORE leads Leo deeper into the ship. The brig is Spartan but functional, ten bunk beds neatly arranged. Chains and restraints hang from the walls.

From the brig, a connecting passageway opens into a spacious SPE 3X1 ALL-IN-ONE BERTH. It’s a comfortable, if somewhat isolated, living space, positioned portside at the midpoint of the berth.

At the forward end of the Brig, a LADDER ascends, disappearing into the deck plating above.

**INT. UNKNOWN SHIP - DECK 2 (DREAM)**

Leo climbs the ladder. He emerges into a sterile, well-equipped SPE 2X1 INFIRMARY. Medical supplies are meticulously organized.

Forward of the infirmary, another door opens into an SPE 2X1 WORKSHOP. Tools gleam on wall-mounted racks, a fabrication station hums softly. This is a space for maintenance, for repairs, for modifications.

To the port side of the infirmary, an entrance leads to the SPE 2X1 CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS FORE. It's sparse but functional, dominated by a large data-screen and a comfortable-looking bunk. A solitary, stark space.

The workshop also contains a ladder, leading further up. And to its fore, a HOPE TECH HOPE 11 DOCKER – FORE is seamlessly integrated into the hull, a vital point of ingress and egress.

**INT. UNKNOWN SHIP - DECK 3 (DREAM)**

Leo ascends the final ladder from the workshop. He steps directly into the COMMAND BRIDGE. This is the SPE KON-TIKI B-700 BRIDGE, a masterpiece of ergonomic design and tactical display. Holo-screens flicker with data, the captain's chair dominating the center. It feels powerful, yet isolated. A perfect command center for a single, focused pilot.

The dream begins to unravel, images blurring, sounds fading.

**DISSOLVE TO:**

**INT. CHAWLA OUTPOST - DAY**

Leo jolts awake, blinking. The magazine lies open at his feet, the image of the Freelancer II still burned into his mind. An ERS version. A stealth hunter. The dream was more than just a dream; it was a blueprint.

The nagging question remains: what happened to the original?

**INT. ERS COMMAND CENTER - DAY (EARLIER)**

Leo sits before a secure comms terminal,LEC's logo prominently displayed.

LEO

\> I would like to speak to the CEO and inquire about the Freelancer II, serial designation LEC-789.

The screen flickers. A pleasant, but slightly harried, VOICE responds.

LEC REPRESENTATIVE (O.S.)

\> Ah, the Freelancer II. A legend, not a commercially viable product. Went missing years ago, Mr. S. Vanished without a trace. Final registered position was at Eleos Retreat, Ixyll II. Haven't had a ping since. Also, letting you know that the CEO of LEC has been missing for weeks now. We have no idea where to find them. We have our security teams looking them.

Leo's jaw tightens. The ship and CEO is missing. Not start Leo wanted to have.

**EXT. ELEOS RETREAT, IXYLL II - DAY**

The *Oregon*, Leo's more unassuming scout craft, sits discreetly among a collection of other vessels at a bustling spaceport. It’s painted in drab, civilian colors, designed to draw no attention.

Leo, cloaked in a common work-jumpsuit, slips into the Ship Services office. He moves with practiced ease, his gaze sweeping for security measures, for watchful eyes. The office is quiet, the attendant distracted by a data-pad.

Leo approaches a public terminal, feigning interest in local trade manifests. His fingers fly across the keys, bypassing the public interface, digging deeper into the port's internal logs. He searches for LEC-789, the Freelancer II.

The records load. Freight manifests. Fuel consumption. Docking permits. All present, but a crucial detail emerges: the last entry for external flight clearance is years old. The ship arrived, and never left.

Leo backs out of the system, leaving no trace. A ghost in the machine.

**INT. OREGON - COCKPIT - DAY**

Leo is back in the *Oregon*'s cockpit, the console bathed in the soft glow of data screens. He pulls up the Eleos Retreat spaceport's historical transponder logs, sifting through the noise.

He finds it: the Freelancer II’s unique transponder code. He cross-references, validates. The real one.

He inputs the code into the *Oregon*'s long-range scanner. A moment of silence, then a triumphant, albeit faint, PING.

COMPUTER VOICE

\> Signal detected. Source: Pyraas System. Trajectory… turning off scanner.

The ping vanishes. Leo leans back, a grim smile playing on his lips. She's not gone. She's just hiding.

**EXT. PYRAAS SYSTEM - SPACE**

The *Comfort*, an ERS marvel of engineering, cuts a silent swath through the blackness of space. Its formidable weaponry and advanced shields are a stark contrast to the *Oregon*'s deceptive humility. Leo chose the *Comfort* for this leg of the journey; a hunch, perhaps, or a premonition that this would not be a simple retrieval.

**INT. COMFORT - BRIDGE - DAY**

Leo reactivates the long-range transponder scanner. This time, the signal is stronger, clearer.

COMPUTER VOICE

\> Transponder signal locked. Location: Pyraas VI-C. Planetary moon.

**EXT. PYRAAS VI-C - DAY**

Pyraas VI-C is a desolate, frozen moon, ravaged by ancient impacts and ceaseless, biting winds. The *Comfort* has landed in a crater, its hull gleaming with frost.

Leo, bundled in environmental gear, exits the ship, scanner in hand. He treks across the icy terrain, the transponder's signal growing louder with each crunching step.

He stops. Before him, half-buried in a snowdrift, is a mangled heap of metal. Twisted girders, shattered hull plating, a distinctive twin-engine assembly. The wreckage of the FREELANCER II.

The air is still, save for the howling wind. No signs of life. No escape pods. The cold, hard truth sinks in. The phantom ship found no victory here, only a silent grave. The mystery of its disappearance is solved, its fate a tragic end. The remoteness of Pyraas VI-C, over sixty light-years from the nearest UC or Freestar jurisdiction, means this secret will remain his.

His gaze hardens. The dream resurfaces, crisp and clear. The blueprint. The new purpose.

He will rebuild it. Not an exact replica, but an evolution. A trap door spider, designed to strike from the deepest shadows.

**INT. ERS HIDDEN SHIPYARD - NIGHT**

Months later. The clang of metal, the hiss of plasma welders, the hum of advanced machinery. The new *Freelancer II* takes shape.

This isn't just a ship; it's an extension of Leo's grim resolve. Its hull is coated in an unstable, advanced cloak, its radar signature mutable at the touch of a button. Its transponder, a bespoke ERS unit, can mimic any civilian vessel, any freighter, any pleasure craft. An untraceable ghost.

On its visible surfaces, six TATSU 501EM SUPPRESSOR TURRETS are mounted, innocuous and unassuming. They are the veil.

**INT. FREELANCER II - WEAPONS BAY - NIGHT**

Hidden within the sleek lines of the ship, concealed behind movable panels and stealth-field generators, are the teeth of the spider: Six VANGUARD OBLITERATOR AUTOCANNONS, designed to tear through anything. Six MATILIJA AEROSPACE TI38 MISSILE RACKS, loaded for utter destruction. These weapons will only be deployed in the void, where there are no prying eyes.

The bridge, inspired by his dream, is a nexus of tactical information. The 10-bed brig sits ready.

**EXT. CHAWLA OUTPOST - NIGHT**

The new *Freelancer II* sits quietly on the landing pad, a dark silhouette against the inky sky. No lights, no hum. It's invisible, even to casual observation.

Leo watches from the habitat, a faint, almost imperceptible satisfaction on his face. This ship will require no public docks, no bustling spaceports. His outpost, upgraded with ERS supply lines, will provide everything it needs. The only time it will touch a populated world is the Red Mile, to offload its grim harvest of prisoners.

**INT. CRIMSON FLEET COMMAND SHIP - BRIDGE - NIGHT**

A frantic VOX chatter fills the air.

CRIMSON FLEET CAPTAIN

\> Another supply convoy gone. Clean. No survivors, no traces. Just… vanished.

VOICE (O.S.)

\> Ecliptic are reporting the same. Spacers, too. Even some of Watchtower’s patrols.

CRIMSON FLEET CAPTAIN

\> Has anyone seen anything? A new ship? A new signature?

Silence.

**EXT. DEEP SPACE - NIGHT**

The *Freelancer II* drifts silently, a dark void against the star field. Its transponder code is currently broadcasting as a benign research vessel, far from any system of interest. Its radar signature is indistinguishable from a small asteroid.

Leo sits on the bridge, the holographic displays showing the vast, empty expanse. His eyes, devoid of emotion, watch a distant, blip of a Watchtower patrol. The perfect target.

No one sees the *Freelancer II*. No one will. It moves through the dark, an unseen predator, hunting the shadows, becoming the very ghost it once sought. The true phantom of the void.

More to come on the missing CEO of LEC. Leo plans on searching for the ceo.

**FADE OUT.**

I've seen people comment about having dinner at a place and making it romantic or having plans for the date to go long.  I also find it odd that people want or offer to pick up the other person.

I must be biased or maybe more bad experiences versus good ones.  

Personally, I'm going to meet up at a place for coffee.  I would possibly do a pub or sports bar as long as it wasn't too loud and we could have a conversation.  If I do the pub/sports bar route, I'm drinking water or soda.  

I am also driving separately and won't be picking the other person up.  If the date were to quickly go badly, I'm able to leave on my own and I will not be responsible for getting the other person home.

I will also set this outing to be 30-45 minutes.  I will plan something to do after the date so that I have a valid reason to leave.

I also can’t drink 1/3 of a cup of coffee early in the morning and sleep ok in the night anymore. I feel like I’m on amphetamine on small doses of caffeine. Feels like shit. 

I cannot eat as mush as I should even tho I workout. Takes many hours for me to digest food. I probably have atleast 25 symptoms of CPTSD which I’m aware of. 

Here in Sweden they don’t even help me in any single way with my CPTSD. They demand me to do DBT 1 year before I get any help which psychiatrist/EMDR/CBT. To ”stabilize”… I tried it for 3 weeks and it was just really stupid exercises which no one seemed to understand how they would even help. (YouTube meditations, and standing in a diving position with a towel of icecubes in the head to ”lure” the body into diving in ”cold water” to
Make me calm… 

I easily run into trouble with troublemakers on the street because I have shitty temper and low tolerance. 

I have been threated with knife 6 times in my life. Mother and uncle
Fighting over drugs, smashing windows, screaming, police, in my home since I barely could walk. Every week of my life growing up until 12 y.o. As soon as I cried for a normal reason as a kid. My mom snapped with fire in her eyes - dragging me by my hair, pushed me into my room, locking my door from
the outside ”you don’t come out from here until you finished crying!” 

She also slapped me once what I can remember. But I don’t even remember 1% from my childhood while I was with my mother. It’s almost picture.

So often I had to jump in her bed to wake her up. And she just rejected my demand for help with food etc. She preferred to sleep for 24h straight some times. I have a clear memory from when I had stomach flue. Vomit all over my bed. No mom
to help. 

My uncle used to party there and got thrown out for being to aggressive often. And he comes back the same day to hurt my mom. Threatening me to my life through the window when he didnt smash them When I was a toddler. 

He beat my aunt half to death over a bag of drugs. 

Moms boyfriend assaulted my father infront of me as a toddler. 

As a teen my big brother had sex with my girlfriend while we still were together. 

I got my first tramadol from mom when I was 13. For backpain, but still… I were hooked. Stole hundreds, probably thousands of them from her when she wasn’t home. Ended up in the ER for having grand mal seizures, atleast 3 times from tramadol overdoses. 

I later on started using Xanax, amphetamine, fentanyl, tram from dealers, abusing alcohol heavily. Had atleast 10 more fullblown seizures. 

I was about to inject amph with two friends at 16 but decided to step back after watching the older guy missing the vein on my friends over 30 times. Had me disgusted - thank god. 

Had my door punched in when I wasn’t home by a total psycho who’s biggest passion in life is torturing people in the woods. This guy tried to blackmail me for money and threatened me over facebook. 

Has my tooth punched out by another psycho and his friend who also threatened me to stab my innocent autistic father if I did not give him 50$ … fifty bucks… 

Later I heard my mom got beaten once and she left the room snd I went after. She denied it all. Next day I was thrown out for ”falsely accusing” her husband. 

She still denies it happend and are ”angry” on me for this… I heard it all and I was sober. He threatened her after the slap. He was drunk. 

All my girlfriends I ever had had cheated on me. 

On my 17th birthday police showed up for a fight I was in 3 months earlier. 3 against me , they started it. After interrogation the cops wouldn’t let me go before I gave them urine drug test. I refused because they came to me fathers appartment on my birthday 8 in the morning. 

They took me handcuffed to my health clinic where I know the people working there (my neighborhood). I refused urine and blood sample. Three cops took me to a room together with 2 nurses. Me hand cuffed behind my back. A tired 17 y.o, what a ”threat” huh… 

They lifted me up in the air throwing me in my stomach, holding me still, screaming to the nurses to put the needle in my arm to take blood and they got scared first, then they obeyed the powertrippers out of fear. 

I started to cry because I felt so helpless. One of the cops loosened the handcuffs and had a mocking smile on his face while he said ”enjoy the rest of your birthday”. 

They choosed my birthday to take me. To hurt me. I’ve hated cops since then. 

At 7-10 years old in school me and other kids were abused by the teachers. It was a smaller school where people needed more support with school. It was kids with a lot of anger and trauma who went there. Not diagnoses like downs or anything like that.

They wrestled us down to the floor holding us down with knee on the back, multiple teachers holding down body parts. For simply being angry and hitting a wall or screaming at someone, it’s totally illegal. 

We went for skiing trip every winter  - renting a house also. The teachers had parties and were dancing drunk on the table. Letting us kids taste their booze so they could laugh at our reaction. Everyone were 7-10 y.o 

At 17 me and my best friend were smoking a big joint getting super high. At the peak of our high , a guy we know with he’s 3 friends kicked in my door while they were drunk to assault my friend. I did not even defend him because I was scared. I went around the house to call police. I’m so ashamed for not helping him to fight them. 

This event made me colder as a person, I wanted to grow more ”balls” and show people I no longer were no coward. I got into a lot of fights and did terrible things to people who did even smaller things to me or friends. 

My brother used to show me execution videos on the internet when I was maybe 10 y.o. We watched a probably 9-11 year old Russian kid overdosing on heroin with his two friends or older brothers. 

He scared the living shit out of me as a kid. Convincing me that demons living under my bed. Woke me upp so many times acting in such a disturbing way I can’t even explain it. I get that brothers scare each other, totally ”normal”,  but this was on another level. My cousins speak about this behavior even at older age because they are sure he traumatized me. 

My brother made me give him handjobs multiple times before I even know what that really was. 

Criminal gangs / debt collectors contacted my family because my brother scammed many people on money.

But, the more I dabbled, the more I learned how sounds went together. I learned of things like lyrics changing to fit sounds. I saw certain musical genres worked better with certain lyrics. It was still not seen as art to me.

I then decide to work on a themed collection, as a treatise of sorts, on the nature of creativity and generative AI.  I pick styles out for songs.  I see some that fit better.  I regenerate songs.  I regenerate the song.  I actively refine the final song.  I also finalize what should be images and generate those.  I presume it is much like record production.

I then lump together other random songs I did under a them, and have an AI generated cover reflect the collection.

I go on, picking out themes.  I even do a multisong narrative telling a story... with images.

I do another collection on the nature of art.  I dunk on AntiAI folk, mock their arguments. Do garbage songs that are technically art but sound horrible, even if the lyrics said it was art.  The images mapped to the music.  

With this art introspection came two songs about framing a coffee stain, told from different perspectives.  One had me actually see art differently and to grow up, with the last few songs reflecting maturity.  The collection was a reflection of a journey looking into art, and all the works collectively told a story.  Such would be invisible to those who do not see the playlist the songs are on.

In this, I learned why album's exist and why they matter.  I have done multiple since.

And am now putting finishing touches on a collection of Saturday Morning kid show theme songs. The collection's playlist is organized like a Saturday morning line up.  All have images reflective of each of the shows, in styles of what they are as TV shows. With this comes the creation of characters like a victorian beatnik detective and an baby Baba Yaga.  And questions about their stories. 

I look over all this.  I see what came to  be.  Even leaving out the music... the series of images themselves in a collection themselves act by about every measure I can think of, as art.  Not a single one, but collectively act as one.  What I see in the generative AI as art or not is a focus on a single work.  Would someone evaluate digital art by individual pixels? But that is this whole internet debate... over a single image being art... why?  Not saying an image generated by a single prompt can't be art, but the case is stronger for something being art the more that is directed by humans.  AntiAI art as art people think something is just one prompts. However, it often is not.  Properly setting up prompts is also a skill.

Somewhere along the line I became a generative AI artist.  Weird world.  And I have been fixated on the music.  I will say I did stumble into some good tunes along the way.  How much of it is me remains.  But I am involved to find interesting things, not applause.

1nizhpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nizhpn/castenada_part_18/,Castenada (Part 18),"I, like many others of similar poor circumstances, found myself unable to find adequate employment as a freelance writer. Some might blame it on Hoover or the stock market crash, but I blame my unemployment on my inability to submit any work that any of the publishers particularly liked. While I’ve had a few paltry short stories published in some of the bi-monthly pulps, none pay particularly well enough (though I heard they have started shilling out a penny per word for some of their flagship writers). They claim they’re looking for more “imaginative works,” whatever on Earth that’s supposed to mean.

I ended up packing up whatever little bound me to Chicago and made my way to the frontier of the old Oregon Territory. I had heard on good authority that it was a tranquil expanse of land bolstered by natural beauty and certainly a far cry from the violent bustle of the urban sprawl. One of my correspondents who had left Seattle following the Great War had mentioned in some of his letters a quiet settlement a long way south nestled somewhere in the Cascades by the name of Castenada. He said he had the most peculiar dreams of such fanciful grandeur that he felt deeply inspired to write his forthcoming novella.

I am by no means a man possessed of superstitious fervor nor am I one too jaded by the callous modernity of the sciences, but I found myself enraptured by the fantasy of going to a remote mountain town to dream among towering pines and verdant mountains. It would at the very least be a pleasant respite from the crumbling industrial abattoir that Chicago has been molded into. I had spent what little I was able to muster from selling off what I could to ride coach cross country, take another train from Seattle to Portland, and then another two bus rides out to Castenada. Suffice it to say, it was a rather exhaustive journey with light meals of canned beans and cups of watered-down black coffee to keep me alert. 

It was on the last leg of the journey where I had lost all sensible distinction between wakefulness and sleep as I spent hours watching soaring peaks rise up from the soil like great tidal waves threatening to capsize the bus. Before long, I found myself engulfed in the depths of the lightless undertow of an immense forest. Heavy torrential rain buffeted the roof and windows of the bus all the way. I gazed out into the rare vantages where I could see the side of the road that plummeted away at a stark angle, before long revealing a broad valley of tall blackened stumps and logs stripped bare of their branches. I could see blackened earth and the few sparse places where flora had slowly crept back in. At the far center of the valley was a small unassuming town that looked either under construction or in complete disrepair.

I had no reason to assume that *this* was the same Castenada that had been described to me in my colleague’s letters. What he had described to me was akin to a frontier Shangri-La, but I was instead looking down the barrel at a half-burned ruin. My mood had shifted rapidly from dread to anger to confusion as the bus descended into the valley. Had Lane Sawyer lied to me? Was this some elaborate reuse to trick me into fleeing from Chicago for some hidden purpose? Did I come here based on a hoax? After conferring with the bus driver that I was in fact at my destination, I paid him the rather steep $2 fare and made my way to the nearest hotel.

The foyer looked to be in a state of utter disrepair with rolled up carpets stashed in one corner, chairs stacked atop one another in the other, and stacks of disheveled papers and ledgers strewn across the concierge’s desk. I walked up to the counter and rang the bell, expecting someone to come out from the back office, but there was no one. I rang it again, before long hearing the startled shambling of someone through the door behind the counter. Through the rippled glass I could make out the figure of a rotund bald gentleman in suspenders as he opened the creaking door and shuffled his way into the foyer. He plucked the pair of spectacles slung around the collar of his stained shirt and looked up at me finally as though I was rude for having woken him from his catnap.

“What can I do you for?” he asked in a surprisingly chipper tone the belied his disheveled demeanor.

“A room for the weekend if it’s no bother.” I requested.

He retrieved a ledger from among his many books, opened it, and examined its contents before closing it and repeating this process two more times until he at least offered one for me to sign into. “None at all, Mister…?”

“Merriam, Joseph Merriam.” I said as I wrote my name.

“Ah, Joseph Merriam… Where would I know that name?” he pondered.

My eyes lit up. I had never had the opportunity to encounter a person not in my line of work who had read any of my stories. “Why, I’m a writer of ghost stories. Perhaps you have read one of mine in Weird Tales?”

“No, no, I don’t read that garbage,” he clarified. “Are you by any chance related to Belinda Merriam? The woman who makes the crab apple and raisin pies?”

My mood quietly soured, “No, I can’t say that I am.”

“Oh, I heard her son got kicked in the head by a horse last spring. Terrible shame,” he said.

“Yeah, that sounds like it.” I replied, uncertain where it was I was supposed to direct this conversation. “How much do I owe you?”

“For the horse? Couldn’t tell you.” he said with an even tone, then allowing his statement to linger before laughing abruptly. I chuckled politely at his nonsensical joke as I second guessed whether or not I truly wanted to stay here. “Ah, I’m just having a bit of fun, Mr. Merriam! It’ll be $6 for the weekend. If you decide to extend your stay, it’ll be another $2 a night.”

I ransacked my pockets of every cent and dollar I had, finding I had just enough for dinner and a whiskey. “Do the rooms have telephones, Mister…?”

“Call me Dwight,” he said with a smile. “Yes, they do. However, it’s getting late and I’m not sure if the switchboard operators are still in at this hour if you were looking to call long distance. We haven’t gotten around to setting up the automated switchboards locally.”

“You don’t say.” I said as I looked around the foyer, examining the various lopsided taxidermy trophy heads of coyotes and deer. “Well, if you have the key I’d like to get my things set in my room, if you don’t mind.”

“Not at all, Mr. Merriam,” he said, fetching a key from one of the wall-mounted hooks behind him. “Be my guest! First door to your right at the top of the stairs. If you need anything, simply dial 0 on your room’s telephone and it will connect you to my office.”

I nodded my thanks and carried my bags upstairs. The room was hardly anything to write home about, but I had slept on enough hardwood floors in the corners of clustered offices before so a bed was a bed as far as I was concerned on the matter. I stashed my luggage and returned downstairs to get a lay of the night life in Castenada, but first stopped to ask Dwight a few questions before leaving while I had the chance.

“Dwight,” I asked. “I was wondering if you could maybe tell me a bit about what happened to the town. It looks like a disaster has hit.”

Dwight looked up from shuffling a few papers around his desk, “Forest fire. Worse than the one in ‘98, from what I’ve heard.”

“Forest fire, eh,” I mimicked. “You wouldn’t happen to know where I could get a bite to eat around here would you?”

He shrugged, “There’s an eatery down the street from here. The soup is usually good.”

“How about a drink?” I asked.

He cocked an eyebrow like one of those holdout abolitionists, “There’s a bar not far from the eatery. Never been in there myself.”

“Much obliged, Dwight.” I said, tipping my hat before walking out onto the twilit rainy streets.

After a rather disappointing sandwich, I made my way towards the old watering hole. The air was choked with cigarette smoke and dimly lit with lamps that glowed with reddish and green hues. The polished floors looked immaculate, like marble in a mausoleum. Somewhere in the haze I could hear jazz softly playing. The well-dressed barkeep leaned against the mahogany counter with a wry grin on his gaunt face, his slicked back hair reflecting with emeralds and rubies, “What can I get started for you, stranger?”

“Have you got a bottle of Old Stagg?” I asked as I took a seat at the bar.

“I might,” he said, briefly examining his shelf lined with amber bottles by the dozen. “How do you take it?”

“Neat.” I said, placing a quarter on the counter and sliding it towards him with a finger.

“Coming right up,” he said before quickly grabbing a fresh glass and pouring a generous amount of whiskey into it with a flourish.

I nodded my thanks and took deep bitter sips, feeling the warmth course through my chest and lightening the weight of my sorrows. I examined my fellow patrons, most of whom were seated at private booths or at the bar. Many had the look of labor-hardened men set to the difficult task of rebuilding their mountain town from the ashes. One among them, however, I espied immediately. He was impeccably dressed, though he seemed a queer fellow. He wore a black silken cape and a top hat atop his head. He too was nursing a whiskey alone beneath a red lamplight, his features outlined in crimson. His eyes flicked up from the counter to meet my gaze and he raised his glass in invitation to sit beside him. Not one to turn down local hospitality, I did so.

“I bid you due welcome to our dismal slice of hell, fare drifter!” he chuckled. “Tell me, what winds blew you into town?”

“A writer friend of mine I know mostly through letters,” I said. “He claimed he had a wonderful time here.”

The cloaked man looked around the bar and laughed, “Ha! I couldn’t imagine a writer having much positive to say about Ol’ Castenada! Likely his idea of a joke?”

I shrugged, “Thought so myself when I saw all the burned down trees and houses. What kept you here after all that smoke?”

“Well,” he said as he pulled a cigarette case from his interior breast pocket. “I have a certain interest in the area that is necessary for my line of work.”

“And exactly what line of work are you in?” I asked as he stuck a cigarette in his mouth and patted himself for a lighter. I lit it with my own.

“Much obliged,” he said, tipping his hat and inhaling. He exhaled, blowing smoke into the red light. “Really I’m in two businesses. The first and foremost is entertainment and show business, hence my digs. You may have heard of the Amazing Amsi?”

I shook my head, “Sorry, can’t say I have.”

He shrugged, taking another drag, “Not a magic fan?”

I shook my head again, “I’m from Chicago.”

“Ah, Chicago.” he chuckled, smoke billowing from his lips. “What was it Carl Sandburg said of Chicago? ‘They tell me you are crooked and I answer: yes, it is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again’?”

I smirked, “Yeah, something like that.”

“Never performed in Chicago, but I’ve been.” he said taking another drag. “On my way back from the War. Did you serve?”

“Can’t say I did.” I replied somewhat sheepishly.

“Lucky you.” he said, taking a long drink of his whiskey. “There are things you leave behind in the trenches that are much too heavy to carry home with you. People, mostly. That brings me to my second line of work: I’m a spiritualist. A dabbler in connecting with the Beyond. I’ve studied under the tutelage of various mediums, gurus, occultists, mystics, shamans, physicists, and chemists. I have devised a genuine replicable system of connecting with the spirits of the dearly departed using means that the scientific field has yet to catch up to. In my research, I’ve discovered that there are a number of thin points in the noosphere that penetrate heretofore unmapped vertices and tangent spaces parallel to our reality. The most impressive and consistent one is centralized right here in this valley. The Indians that lived here knew it, the Spanish knew it, and countless people before me came to the same realization. None, however, came anywhere as close to understanding the nature of such things until now with the joining of the noble sciences, esoteric mysticism, and modern hypnosis.”

I took another drink, uncertain how to respond to anything he just said. “So, you’re a conman?”

He balked at this, “I have no interest in prying the coffers of lumberjacks and construction workers. If anything, I’m paying them to build my home, studio, laboratory, and temple.”

“All four? In this town?” I asked incredulously.

He smirked, smoke ushering forth from his nostrils like a dragon. “Four functions in one house. You should see the work in progress if you’re not too busy on your sabbatical.”

I finished my drink, “Sure, I can take a gander. Where is it?”

He smirked, “Corner of 40th and Sycamore in New Albion. Can’t miss it.”

1nizh1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Farhanamili/comments/1nizh1l/standard_flexible_packaging_a_reliable_solution/,Standard Flexible Packaging: A Reliable Solution for Modern Industry Needs,"The packaging sector has undergone massive transformations over the past few decades, but **standard flexible packaging** continues to stand out as one of the most reliable, cost-effective, and versatile options available today. Unlike rigid packaging, which often relies on heavier materials such as glass, tin, or hard plastics, flexible packaging uses lightweight films, foils, and laminates to create bags, pouches, and wraps. Its adaptability has made it a cornerstone in industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and household goods. The appeal of standard flexible packaging lies in its balance of durability, affordability, and convenience, making it an essential component of global supply chains and consumer lifestyles.

One of the primary strengths of [**standard flexible packaging**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style) is its **practical functionality**. These packaging formats are designed to maximize product protection while minimizing resource usage. For example, flexible films provide excellent barriers against oxygen, moisture, light, and other external factors that could compromise freshness or product quality. This makes them particularly useful for perishable goods such as snacks, dairy, and coffee. Features like resealable zippers, tear notches, and spouts add further convenience for consumers, while stand-up pouch designs allow for easy storage and attractive shelf presentation. By combining protective qualities with user-friendly features, standard flexible packaging ensures both efficiency in distribution and satisfaction at the consumer level.

https://preview.redd.it/1pqp8aogkmpf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=1025109a5c4576ca0747616ac132ef741039587e

Another major benefit of standard flexible packaging is its **economic efficiency**. Because it requires less raw material than rigid alternatives, it is cheaper to produce, lighter to transport, and more compact to store. This translates into lower production costs for manufacturers and reduced shipping expenses across supply chains. For example, a truck filled with flexible packaging can carry more units than one filled with jars or bottles, cutting down fuel consumption and overall logistics costs. These savings are significant for businesses in competitive markets where margins are tight. Furthermore, the adaptability of standard flexible packaging makes it easy for companies to produce large or small runs, catering to both mass production and niche markets without significant delays or expenses.

In addition to cost and functionality, standard flexible packaging plays an important role in **sustainability efforts** across industries. While packaging waste has long been a concern, innovations in material science have allowed manufacturers to develop recyclable, biodegradable, and even compostable flexible packaging options. Standard designs are now often produced using mono-material structures that simplify recycling and reduce environmental impact. Lightweight construction further minimizes carbon emissions by decreasing energy use during manufacturing and transportation. By integrating eco-friendly practices into standard packaging designs, companies can meet stricter government regulations while appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. This shift highlights the dual advantage of standard flexible packaging: it addresses sustainability challenges without sacrificing performance.

Looking ahead, the future of **standard flexible packaging** is closely tied to technological innovation and global market expansion. Digital printing technologies now allow for high-quality graphics and personalized designs, even in small batches, enabling brands to create eye-catching packaging that connects with consumers on an emotional level. Smart packaging features, such as QR codes for product information or freshness indicators, are being integrated into standard flexible designs, enhancing transparency and consumer trust. Meanwhile, the rapid rise of e-commerce has created new opportunities for flexible packaging to adapt to shipping requirements while maintaining durability and aesthetics. As developing regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America continue to expand their middle-class populations, demand for packaged goods—and therefore standard flexible packaging—is set to grow exponentially. By combining affordability, sustainability, and innovation, standard flexible packaging will remain a vital force in shaping the packaging industry of the future.",1,1758071261.0,u_Farhanamili,0,1.0,False

I felt dizzy briefly then about a minute later started shaking and the next thing I know I woke up in an ambulance. From what my husband tells me I cannot remember roughly 30 minutes of time. The nights leading up to this I was significant short on sleep, very stressed, the immediate night before I drank alcohol when I don’t normally drink and morning of had regular coffee and I don’t normally drink caffeine. The ER discharged me with a diagnosis or syncope, and my primary care was pretty dismissive with a “let’s see if it happens again” approach. Thankfully I found a neurologist who took me seriously and ordered additional tests.

I had an MRI that came back normal. My EEG is “non specific”. The EEG note says This EEG during wakefulness only is mildly abnormal due to the presence of generalized sharply contoured slowing seen during sleep. While nonspecific and possibly a benign drowsy variant (hypnagogic hypersynchrony), generalized epileptiform activity cannot be fully excluded.

I have quite a bit of health anxiety and spent most of yesterday panicking that I had a brain tumor until the MRI results came back. Now I’m worried about a life altering epilepsy diagnosis. Appreciate any thoughts/insights/talking me off a ledge. Next steps are to do an at home 48hr EEG then follow up with Neuro.

1nizeyp,https://i.redd.it/2ifevhzacmpf1.jpeg,Looking for feedback on my chalkboard guide for finishing,"This is for a class where we make a mostly-softwood butcher block coffee table. 

I explain that finishes that build up provide more protection from dents but require more careful application. Oils that soak in aren't as protective but they're easier to apply.

Polycrylic is water based and so it's easy to apply but doesn't give the same color.

I recommend they always put paste wax on as the very last step, as it's an extra level of protection, but it has to be last because nothing will stick to it.

For them, I suggest either tung oil if they're not going to use it as a coffee table (i.e. light use) and polyurethane if they are, to protect from frequent use.

They don't stain these tables. We sand to 180 before the end of the class. 

I _DON'T_ teach them how to actually do the finishes because that's outside of the scope of the class, but I do describe briefly about sanding between coats and overlapping strokes.

How easy (or tedious) manual grinders really are to use on the regular? Say I wanna do 15g fine, how long exactly does it take cranking the mechanism before all grinds are in the catch or dosing cup?

Any tips on how to find good manual grinders? I seem to fall into a rabbit hole of sorts every time and figured I should find out first if using one fits my workflow for brewing. My non-negotiable is a collapsible handle so I can stow it in the bag easily.

Thoughts/opinions are appreciated!",1,1758070323.0,CoffeePH,10,0.67,False
1niz4a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloggersCommunity/comments/1niz4a8/custom_pouches_modern_packaging_solutions_for/,Custom Pouches: Modern Packaging Solutions for Brands and Consumers,"In the rapidly evolving world of packaging, **custom pouches** have become one of the most popular and versatile solutions for businesses across industries. Unlike traditional boxes or rigid containers, pouches are flexible, lightweight, and highly customizable to suit specific brand needs. From food and beverages to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and household products, custom pouches provide a practical and visually appealing way to package goods. They are designed not only to protect the product but also to serve as a branding tool that captures consumer attention on crowded store shelves. With their unique combination of functionality, sustainability, and aesthetic appeal, custom pouches are redefining the way companies think about packaging in the modern marketplace.

One of the key reasons behind the rising demand for [**custom pouches**](https://mtpak.com/) is their **ability to enhance brand identity and consumer engagement**. Unlike standard packaging, pouches can be fully customized in terms of shape, size, color, and finish, allowing businesses to create a design that reflects their brand’s personality. Advanced printing techniques enable high-resolution graphics, metallic accents, and even interactive features like QR codes that connect customers to digital content. For example, a coffee brand can design resealable matte-finish pouches with bold colors that stand out on shelves while also communicating freshness and premium quality. These visual and functional elements make custom pouches a powerful tool for differentiation in competitive markets, where packaging often plays a decisive role in purchase decisions.

Beyond aesthetics, custom pouches deliver **exceptional functionality and convenience** for consumers. Features like resealable zippers, spouts, and tear notches provide ease of use while ensuring product freshness and reducing waste. Stand-up pouches are particularly popular because they combine stability with portability, making them ideal for snacks, pet food, and beverages. Flat pouches, on the other hand, are perfect for single-use products such as spices, supplements, or sample packs. Customization also extends to barrier properties, with options like moisture-resistant, oxygen-blocking, or UV-protective layers to keep sensitive products safe and fresh for longer periods. This functional versatility makes pouches adaptable to countless product categories, reinforcing their position as a packaging solution that balances practicality with innovation.

Another significant advantage of custom pouches is their **alignment with sustainability goals**. In an era where consumers and governments are increasingly demanding eco-friendly solutions, businesses are turning to pouches as a way to reduce their environmental footprint. Compared to rigid packaging like glass jars or metal cans, pouches require fewer raw materials, consume less energy in production, and generate lower transportation emissions due to their lightweight nature. Many manufacturers now offer recyclable or compostable pouch materials, as well as mono-material options that simplify recycling processes. For companies, this not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to responsible practices. Eco-conscious consumers are more likely to support brands that package their products in sustainable custom pouches, making this innovation a win-win for both businesses and the planet.

Looking ahead, the future of custom pouches is shaped by **technological innovation and global demand growth**. Smart packaging features such as freshness indicators, QR codes for traceability, and augmented reality experiences are becoming integrated into pouch designs, offering brands new ways to connect with consumers. The booming e-commerce sector is also driving the development of durable pouches that can protect products during shipping while maintaining attractive presentation upon arrival. Meanwhile, expanding middle-class populations in regions like Asia-Pacific and Latin America are fueling greater demand for packaged goods, creating new opportunities for businesses that leverage custom pouch packaging. With their ability to combine functionality, sustainability, and creativity, custom pouches are not only meeting current market needs but also shaping the future of packaging worldwide.",1,1758070276.0,BloggersCommunity,0,1.0,False

Not just stuck, but entombed. Buried alive in a forest of beige cubicles, at the bottom of a well she was forced to dig for herself. All for the mundane reality of paying bills and feeding herself. Her well was an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. customer service job at a firm called Cloud Services GmbH. A place where dreams went to die and were then resurrected as spreadsheets.

The air was thick with the monotonous, empty chatter of two dozen people, each one a pixelated zombie, manically hammering away at their keyboards. It was a hell of repetition, where the only sound was the click-clack of keys and the tired echo of her own voice: ""Hello and welcome to Cloud Services, my name is Luna Sommerfeldt. Thank you very much for waiting. How can I help you?”

Over and over and over and over again. She had started hating the sound of her voice with a passion. She detached mentally from everything, floating around in the small corner in the back of her mind, daydreaming of anything pleasant. Trying to suppress the urge to drown her sorrow in another pot of cheap brewed coffee.

It was a quiet kind of torture, a slow suffocation. And the longer the day went on, the darker the well became. She had always felt like the problem. A broken puzzle piece trying to fit into a perfect, uniform world. The black sheep of the family since she could remember. Nothing was ever good enough, and the smiles she got were patronizing at best.

And she had started to believe it, even while a storm of frustration brewed deep inside her.

The chaos was a live thing inside her, clawing at the walls. A mischievous, suppressed beast of impulses that she fought to keep on a leash. Most days she won. But some days, the beast broke free.

It started with small things. A pen that mysteriously vanished from her team lead’s desk and reappeared on a coworker’s a week later. A colleague’s chair that had been inexplicably fiddled with, causing them to lean back and tip over like a clumsy drunkard. A coffee mug that turned up filled with paperclips instead of coffee.

Each time, a small part of her felt a jolt of mischievous glee, a tiny victory against the soul-crushing monotony. It was a release, a rebellion.

And today, the beast wanted to break free. She looked at her desk, at the pristine keyboard and the perfectly organized files, and felt a dangerous impulse. She wanted a storm. She wanted the well to collapse. She closed her eyes and wished with all her might for something—*anything*—to happen.

The Universe Wants To Break Free. So it manifests chaos.

And just like that, the ceiling ripped open.",2,1758070266.0,LokiVish,0,1.0,False
