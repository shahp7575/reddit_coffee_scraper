1ghodg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ghodg8/question_for_the_gays/,Question for the gays...,"I (38 M) always knew that I am, turns out everybody knew as well. 

After a long battle, I am finally now able to move out from my conservative living situation to now by myself. 

That was almost a year ago. 

I think I am feeling a bit better now with myself,

I don't have any conventional social media (like X, TikTok, Insta or FB, but I have discord, YT and Reddit) And I am not planning on downloading Grindr or similar Apps. 

Description of myself out of the way, My question is... 

How will I know who's gay? 

Do I, just, simply ask if they are? before asking them for coffee? is coffee even a thing still? 

I play recreational Rugby and sing at a local choir. 

My Rugby team mates and I do a lot of male to male contact teasing, they're still comfortable with me being gay, I think, I try not to overthink when we're together. I fancy one of them and he teases me back but always ends it with ""No homo"" but with a grin, so not offensively - I am assuming that is him indirectly telling me he's not gay, so I am not going further.

Fellow choir singers, I hardly fancy, except for one at the Bass, He seems to be on the nerdy side and I think he's intimidated by my built, I try to approach him and kinda slouches a bit, from what I gathered he likes video games - But don't know any of them, he dressed up as ""Link"" for Halloween, I am able to Google Link and this game called Zelda, checked a few videos, it's alright - I guess, I am more of an NFL guy and is more concerned with the 49ers being injured to the T this season.

So, Do I... Eh, just point blank ask if he's gay and is there like, a coffee equivalent of video games? 

Or better yet? When approaching someone, Do I compliment, ask if they're gay, ask if they wanna hang and hope for the best that they won't think I'm a creep?

I am still trying to be comfortable with my own skin, so, hardly have any experience and I will need all the help that I can get.

From a smallish regional area in NZ so the dating pool is quite small and with the job I have I have to be a little picky about who I match with, nonetheless I have matched with a few women of a similar age and started chatting. 
Hit it off with one and we both have similar interests, and we met at her house for a coffee one afternoon. Messages went from the app we matched on to messenger. The following weekend we went for a bush walk and takeaways back at her house. I enjoyed her company and felt she did as well. When it came time to leave she kissed me (which I enjoyed üòâ) I left and went home. We were talking most days and we would both initiate the conversation. 
However over the past two weeks, while she has still has replying to messages she no longer initiates any chat. I asked her out to comedy show but she had her children that weekend but stated she would have loved to have gone. I asked if she had plans on a weekend I knew she didn't have her children and she said she'd get back to me, but never did.

I haven't tried to push things as I feel she's not into me and trying to let me down easy? Just trying to gauge if my instincts are correct?

Gusto ko (M. 28.) lang palakpakan yung sarili ko kagabi dahil kinaya kong i-handle ng maayos si self after my boyfriend (M. 28) accused me na cheater raw ako, boring kausap, at marami pang iba. For context, these past few weeks madalas ko kasing nare-raise yung kawalan nya ng time sa akin, even sa restdays/weekends (which is sa depensa nya, grabe raw yung workload.) Hanggang sa nasanay na lang din ako na hindi hanapin yung attention nya dahil sa utak ko ""Hindi ko na dapat istorbohin. Baka busy na naman."" Pero normalan pa rin yung conversation, ha? Hindi na lang talaga ako yung mag re-raise ng problema. Kasi nag a-adjust na ako.

Kagabi, inaway nya ako dahil iniisip nya na masama raw yung loob ko sa kanya. Sabi ko, hindi naman. Kasi maayos naman kaming magkausap, eh. Hanggang sa nasabihan nya na ako na masyado raw akong bait-baitan sa response ko (he's expecting siguro na katulad nang dati magiging messy ako). Sabi ko, wala naman akong energy makipag-away kasi okay naman yung mood ko. Pero kung hindi sya okay, ako na yung mag a-adjust. Bibigyan ko sya ng space dahil ginagamitan na nya ako ng clown emojis as reactions sa lahat ng sabihin ko.

Nag sorry pa ako kung saan man sya na-offend. Dumating sa point na sinabi nya na doon na raw ako sa mga ""prospect guys"" na lagi kong kinukwento sa kanya. He's pertaining doon sa staff ng Dunkin na gay guy. Yung staff kasi na 'yon, madalas kong kinukwento sa kanya na sobrang bait at never akong nakakalimutan na kamustahin kada bibili ako ng iced coffee. Sabi ko pa sa boyfriend ko na pagka-dumaan kami, ipapakilala ko si bf doon sa staff... which is ayaw ni boyfriend for whatever reason. Sinabi nya pa na wag na raw ako bumili doon sa branch. Mag pa-deliver na lang daw ako.

So, noong hindi ko na fini-feed yung tantrums nya after kong sabihing yung nasa first paragraph, isa-isa nyang in-unsent yung mga pinagsasabi nya sa akin. Hindi sya nag re-reply. Kaya nag leave na lang ako ng message saying ""Shhh... I know hindi mo sadya. Just take care of yourself. :')"" 

Masakit, syempre. Pero part of me sinasabi na hindi ko dapat damdamin kasi marami akong ginawa for him, and for our relationship. Alam ng lahat na mahirap makipag-relasyon sa kapwa lalake. But for his own sanity, nakilala nya personally lahat ng kamag-anak ko sa big event. Alam nila na may boyfriend ako. Kaya bakit ko kailangan kwestyunin yung worth ko bilang partner, 'di ba? Ginawa ko yung best ko. Kaya wala akong karapatan malugmok sa lungkot. üòä

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/xBQQYatTmy): **October 17, 2024**

I (23F) am getting married in January and just found out my fianc√©e, Mark (25M, fake name) invited his old situationship to our wedding without consulting me.

For context: Me and Mark met on a dating app two years ago after he ‚Äú‚Äùbroke up‚Äù‚Äù a relationship. To be honest, it‚Äôs quite confusing what he and Tracy (22F) had.

They met because of a mutual friend and started to develop feelings for each other. Mark told me they never dated and slept together, but it was more than friendship. Until today he keeps her love letters, gifts and talks about her.

Tracy and him tried to stay in contact after the break up, staying friends but she ghosted him after finding out we started to date. From what I saw in her social media, she‚Äôs in a relationship, so I‚Äôm not worried about her trying to get with my fianc√©e again.

They haven‚Äôt been in contact for 2 years, but he still has her number and email. I found out about him inviting her after I checked again our guest list and finding her name.

I know Tracy is not a threat to our relationship, but Mark inviting her behind my back makes me feel bad about our whole wedding. He told me he doesn‚Äôt feel anything for her, yet he made sure to send her an invitation.

This is probably me being insecure, but my fear of him not getting over her is slowly creeping inside my heart.

I don‚Äôt want to lose him.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He's probably not over her, especially since they were never a thing. For him, she might be the one that got away. If I were OP, I would have a very serious talk with him.

> **OOP:** I don‚Äôt get why he is not over her especially if they were never a thing. From what Mark told me, he was the one who didn‚Äôt wanted a relationship since Tracy ‚Äújust started life‚Äù.

**Commenter 2:** He went behind you back to invite someone whose love letters he‚Äôs kept?? The fact he didn‚Äôt talk to you about it is a üö©. If having her there is more important to him than you being comfortable at your own wedding then you might need to postpone the wedding. She might not be a threat to your relationship but it sounds like your fianc√©‚Äôs feelings are a threat.

> **OOP:** I don‚Äôt know why he is not over her even after two years of no contact. I know Tracy is part of his past, his story but it‚Äôs been such a long time.

**Commenter 3:** tell him you don't want her there and that's final and HE better rescind it or you'll have to rethink the marriage because starting a married life by going behind your back is a no-no. Tbh you need to not stubbornly hold on to someone you can't trust, and you can't trust someone who does shit behind your back.

> **OOP:** Her going to the wedding doesn‚Äôt make me uncomfortable since I know she won‚Äôt do anything. The problem is my fianc√©e and the fact he invited her to the wedding without notifying me.
> 
> If Mark wanted her there, fine. But I just HATE the fact he didn‚Äôt told me beforehand and it‚Äôs making me think he lied about getting over her.

**Commenter 4:** Why do you keep saying I know she won't do anything? If you can't trust him not to do anything with an old fling you should not be getting married.

> **OOP:** Tracy has a boyfriend and is expecting. Also, she was the one who blocked him everywhere after finding out we were dating.

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/GtdkDgcc9v): **October 19, 2024**

After reading the comments and talking with some friends, my heart finally understood Mark never really got over Tracy.

In the beginning, I was in denial, but I went out with Tom (24M), his best friend of years to understand about what really happened between them.

From what he told me, Tracy and Mark met because of some friends in common. She just got into the university and was 17 at the time, while Mark was already almost graduating.

They stayed friend for two years and feelings started to blossom. Mark was already working while she was still in college, he only wanted to formally date her after her graduation, so it was never a thing, even though they shared love letters, gifts and shared almost every holiday together.

Tom told me everyone from their old friend group thought they would marry since they were so sweet together. So, their breakup was really unpredictable.

Tracy was the one who broke up with Mark due to their religious values not lining up, as she wanted to save herself until marriage. In the end, they decided it was better to go separate ways and maybe try again after a few years.

But after me and Mark started to date, Tracy realized that it was pointless to wait for him and started to see other people too, so she blocked in every thing, except email just to have a clean beginning.

In the end, I finally realized Mark is just hopeful that Tracy would come back to him due to their talks of trying again after a while. It honestly hurt so much, as I loved him so much.

I still didn‚Äôt confronted him since I‚Äôm still shaken up, but I don‚Äôt know if this marriage will happen. I am going to update once I calm down and confront him.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** This sucks but at least you found out before you ended up married to this guy.

**Commenter 2:** I‚Äôm sorry OP. It does sound as though your fianc√© hasn‚Äôt moved on.

You deserve someone who can‚Äôt breathe without you, and I hope you can find it with your next partner.

**Commenter 3:** I‚Äôd write down all your feelings and thoughts in a letter to him. Explain what Tom said to you. Tell him it aligns with him keeping the love letters, trying to stay in contact, and bringing her up even two years later while in a relationship with you. Tell him you love him enough to let him go.

I‚Äôd also reach out to Tracy and ask if your fianc√© has been talking to her at all. You never know if there is more to the story, of if she has moved on from him.

From what you wrote, it doesn‚Äôt seem like he moved on from her. He shouldn‚Äôt be inviting someone he still has romantic feelings for to HIS wedding. That‚Äôs cruel to you (his future wife) and Tracy, as well. If I was her, I‚Äôd feel like he was trying to shove his relationship in my face. I‚Äôd be offended he even invited me‚Ä¶.

Also, will this be his first time seeing her in two years? For some reason, I seriously doubt it.

However, if it is - that‚Äôs pretty diabolical. It‚Äôs like he is using your wedding and you as a prop in their love story. Does he think he‚Äôs the male lead in some K drama?

At the very least, give him the letter. If he wants to meet up- ask to see his phone. Go through his deleted messages and sent emails along with his trash folder. I think there‚Äôs more to the story. Were you supposed to walk down the aisle and just see Tracy there?

He‚Äôs honestly an AH‚Ä¶and a selfish one at that.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/YNp0fwpzUZ): **October 25, 2024**

It‚Äôs been a while since the last update and I‚Äôm here to announce the wedding has been called off. My parents are the one canceling everything for me, it‚Äôs like I returned to my childhood when mom and dad had to solve my problems.

I confronted Mark after talking with Tom and made him aware of everything I‚Äôve been dealing. His reaction at the beginning was dismissive and was almost as if he was trying to escape from this situation.

In the end, Mark said he never loved someone like Tracy because it was pure and innocent. She reminded him that not everything is about carnal desire and in the darkest moments of his life, Tracy was like a sunlight.

Hearing the man you love admitting how much he loved another woman is so hurtful. During the talk, I started to cry, bawling my eyes out. Mark had the audacity to say he loves me, but it‚Äôs a different kind of love.

I asked why he invited her to our wedding and he was speechless. Why he had to throw away our future for something in the past?! This hurts so much.

Mark told me he knew Tracy didn‚Äôt blocked him on e-mail, since he was the one who helped her get her first job and a lot of professional stuff was also involved. This is how he was able to send her our wedding invitation, but he ‚Äúmeant no harm‚Äù.

When I asked what he meant with this, Mark just said he wanted to make her watch us together and realize what she lost because he was hurt that Tracy was pregnant and not married.

The moment Mark mentioned about Tracy‚Äôs pregnancy, a red alarm started to echo in my head. ‚ÄúHow did you know about her pregnancy? You said she blocked you every where.‚Äù I could see panic in his eyes as he started to stutter.

In the end, I made him give me his phone and I found out more than 5 accounts to stalk Tracy. My stomach felt sick and the urge to vomit was overwhelming.

In the end, I decided to call off the engagement since he was a creep. Mark threw himself on the floor asking for forgiveness and he loves me, just in a different way compared to Tracy and was just hurt that she gave herself to another man while he begged her countless times for sex.

This made me feel even more disgusted with him because he felt entitled to her virginity and body. I left without taking even a bag with me. Everything is just too much. I can‚Äôt believe I spent two years loving a stalker, a manchild.

Oh, I also told Tracy everything and his accounts. I don‚Äôt know if she saw my messages, but I hope she does. The jealousy I once felt for her transformed into pity as no woman should go through what Mark has done.

Mark wants to meet up with me and doesn‚Äôt want to break up, but I‚Äôm just so tired.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I am so sorry. This really sucks. You should have your parents get your stuff and you should stay as far away from Mark as you can. If he is capable of stalking Tracy, he is capable of stalking you. Make sure that there are security cameras at your parents house and you should block him. The only bright side is that you found this out before you married him.

> **OOP:** Im thinking about leaving the US and going to another country. Social media are not for me, so it‚Äôs harder for him to stalk me.
> 
> I don‚Äôt have anything of great value in Marks house, except some clothes and makeup, so idc if he throws it away

&nsbp;

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2fy7oX9lWU): **October 26, 2024**

I think this is my last update, since I‚Äôve already met up with Tracy and talked about what happened.

Me and her met at a cafe and in the beginning I was really nervous, as I didn‚Äôt know what was her reaction because her reply was only ‚ÄúHi, let‚Äôs talk over a cup of coffee:)‚Äù

When I was waiting for her, I could feel my back sweating and overall, lots of emotion. Tracy arrived and I finally understood why Mark was so obsessed with her as she is definitely one of the most beautiful women I saw. She‚Äôs pretty on the pictures, but personally she looks better.

Tracy said hello to me and asked if I‚Äôm willing to go to her house to talk, since being outside for too long makes her really tired. We ordered some coffee to go and it was super awkward.

So now let‚Äôs talk about what she told me: first of all, she apologized for being the reason why now I‚Äôm single which I assured her is not her fault.

Tracy said she received the invitation, but was simply not interested in participating in our wedding as she was already in a happy relationship and is pointless to see a person from the past.

With the story Tom and Mark told me, I got curious and asked about them ‚Äústaying friends‚Äù as it sounded like she wanted to stay with him after the break up and it‚Äôs the polar opposite of her behavior. Tracy was extremely uncomfortable with this question, but still explained to me why she said that.

In the beginning, she was really in love with Mark because he was her first love. She described him as a protector, someone trustworthy, handsome and kind as he always showered her in gifts and travels.

Everything was fine and sweet but over time, Mark started to beg her for sex so much to the point of her pretending to be sick just to avoid him. She just didn‚Äôt wanted to sleep with him and had some sort of blockage, like a sixth sense telling her to not do this.

She was sick and tired about all of this and used the fact that her parents are extremely religious to justify why sex was off the chart. This lead to a fight, which Mark never told me and them breaking up.

But two weeks after, they started to talk again as she felt in debt with him as he helped her get a job in a prestigious company and he spent a lot of money on her with trips, foods and presents. One of the gifts was a Rolex for her 18th birthday, which made me mad since he NEVER spent so much money on me.

So when Tracy found out me and Mark was seeing each other, she felt relieved and finally had a proper reason to block him everywhere since he was still sometimes hinting about them sleeping together.

In the end, I told her in the entire relationship, Mark would sometimes talk about her and in the beginning it was kind of weird, but I just brushed it off since she was part of his story.

Oh, I also talked about Mark‚Äôs numerous accounts and in the beginning she didn‚Äôt believed me. But I showed her the accounts I knew, which was creepy since they all had female names, followers and pictures. All of them looked real.

Her account is public, so I asked Tracy to make it private. She made a new account with her Korean name and deactivated the old one.

We had fun and became friends. She is a really sweet person and I saw how her boyfriend treated her like a queen. I‚Äôm happy she found love and got rid of Mark.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Sounds like everyone dodged the bullet that was Mark‚Ä¶

> **OOP:** It wasn‚Äôt a bullet. It was a nuclear bomb

**Commenter 2:** I really hope she takes marks stalking seriously. It's very alarming the stuff he has been doing. I'm genuinely afraid for this woman. He's become obsessive and that can't lead to anything good. Especially if he starts spiraling after your breakup.

**Commenter 3:** I‚Äôm so glad you told her. Pregnant women with crazy stalkers get killed at an alarming rate.

I can‚Äôt imagine how awkward and awful and difficult that whole situation and conversation must have been for you. I‚Äôm really proud of you for talking to her and showing her all their accounts so she could protect herself and have all the information. Now, at least whatever else she chooses to do and whatever else happens, you know you‚Äôve done what you could to protect another vulnerable woman. That speaks huge volumes to character and personality and general grace/class overall.

You are going to find someone amazing who truly loves you and matches that upbeat, dignified and character driven vibe you have to the best benefit. :-) I just know it.

I hope you post an update on three years madly in love and hugely successful. ;-)

I started working at this coffee shop 2 months ago myself and almost everyone calls me he/him, a few call me they/them but it‚Äôs not a routine thing. One of our new hires is a trans girl, pretty early on I‚Äôm guessing. She goes by a pretty gender neutral but masc leaning nickname, but she told me she goes by she/her so I know she‚Äôs a girl. However, everyone at work constantly misgenders her. I‚Äôve never heard someone call her by ‚Äúshe‚Äù and I‚Äôve heard a lot of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs‚Äù too. We work together a lot and I‚Äôve never seen her say anything about it even when people do it right in front of her. Even the ally type people that have always been so supportive of me I thought they couldn‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm trans (still 50/50 tbh that‚Äôs how ally they are) call her by they/them. I can tell she‚Äôs mid transition too, without being creepy it‚Äôs pretty visible.

She‚Äôs so sweet and I really want to make her feel better but I also don‚Äôt want to make it worse so I don‚Äôt say anything, please tell me what y‚Äôall would want in this kind of situation. From what i can tell she‚Äôs not very open about her identity but since she told me it can‚Äôt be a secret right?

It really pisses me off how my coworkers are treating her, but at the same time unlike with me it‚Äôs less obvious with her. Looking at me even if I don‚Äôt fully pass it‚Äôs obvious I want to be seen as a guy, but with her it‚Äôs a little trickier. Ugh it just makes me so mad I hate this shit.

I have a friend who converted to Orthodoxy a couple years ago. He's super into it. He has icons, goes multiple times a week, and has for a while now. He even started dating a girl in the church.

But here's the funny part: I've gone with him to church twice. And It's been one of the most profoundly unwelcoming experiences of my life. This is an Antiochan church and most of the people there are cradles. There's a sizeable minority of Greeks as well.

And my god...the divide. Both times I went I instinctively followed and sat with my friend. Both times we spent the service and coffee hour surrounded by other converts, mostly young and middle aged people. Both times the young, Greek Priest basically ignored all of the converts and spent his time with the cradles for the entirety of coffee hour. He even ignored my friend once when he approached him to ask a question. The cradles plan events and parties together. And while they won't necessarily stop converts from going, they make no attempt to include them.

I'm an atheist. But my experiences at that church have been so tense and awkward that it made me miss the sporadic visits to non-denom churches I had as a kid. Like, at least Pastor Jeff pretended he wanted you to be there.

The obvious contempt the cradles have for the converts genuinely makes me wonder why these people bother. Some of these people, like his girlfriend, have been going there for their entire lives! His gf even told me she was ostracized while growing up in the Parish because her mom was a convert. She'd been around some of these people her whole life and they STILL didn't want her around!

And yet my friend buys it.  Doesn't see a problem. He's complained about the exclusionary behavior a couple times, but only when it was egregious (e.g. a woman insisting his girlfriend not wear a veil since she was ""just an American""). And recently he's even started getting in on the anti-western sentiment. And that was honestly just too far for me. Really dude? All this to appease a group of people who clearly don't even want you around?

And things have only progressed from there. He practically lives at church. It's all he talks about. And its showing no signs of stopping any time soon. He even skipped a trip we had planned with some mutual friends to go camping to- you guessed it- go to church.

That's not even the half of it. The church has a fair amount of converts and the ways they're otherized makes me wonder why they even come. Funnily enough, my only other direct experience at an Orthodox church was one that consisted almost entirely of Russian Immigrants- and they were far more welcoming by comparison.

I'm really trying not to paint with broad strokes here. But I've seen too many similar posts on this sub not to share my experiences. I don't want to generalize but it my Orthodox experience has made me feel as though many of these churches are just ethnic clubs with a tax exemption.

There are some things I like such as not having to drive two hours just to get to a grocery store, a functioning public transportation system, and having lots of cool places to go. On the other hand it‚Äôs overwhelming.

I had to move out here for college. 45+ minute commutes to school/work were a real bitch.  Most of my life I‚Äôve lived in rural places or small, barely-on-the-map towns. As boring as it was (not to mention challenging being queer in a place like that), I am not used to being around so many people. 

There‚Äôs no privacy at all. I live with roommates and I did at my old place too but I could always just go outside in the woods if it got to be too much. Here there are no woods. 
 Every square inch of this place there‚Äôs nothing but concrete. We don‚Äôt even have any parks. Everything‚Äôs so out in the open it kind of bothers me. 

What really bothers me though is these hordes of sorority girls and frat boys everywhere laughing at everything with their phones out all the time. I know I sound ridiculous but people film strangers in public without their knowledge or consent for clout and shit all the time. 

The thought of being filmed and people posting it all over the internet if I do something stupid or embarrassing has me on edge. I know other people have their own lives but in my old town I was harassed all the time for ‚Äúlooking gay‚Äù by people I didn‚Äôt even know, or people calling me the r slur for being clumsy or assuming I was a drunk because I was always tripping and walking into things and I‚Äôm paranoid about it happening again.

It‚Äôs also overwhelming being around this many people all the time in general and not having any kind of place I can retreat to. I think I might have social anxiety or something idk. I get overwhelmed by crowds and now grocery shopping is a fucking nightmare. Wall to wall bodies in every store.

I wish I could shop at night or have it delivered. Too bad Instacart‚Äôs so damn expensive. I‚Äôm also in Texas where nothings open past 10 except a couple convenience stores.

It‚Äôs like that on campus too. I know colleges have a lot of people but my old university wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to this size. We had lots of people but it wasn‚Äôt nearly this bad. there were still places around campus you could go that weren‚Äôt packed. I could go to a coffee shop with a friend and actually find a place to sit. No such luck here.

I‚Äôm going crazy here. I hope my partner has some time off work for the holidays so I can crash at his place for a while and get away from all this shit.

My beloved dog went to the vet today for what I thought was a UTI, but it ended up being an obstruction in his urethra and ultrasounds showed his spleen needed removal. It ended up being a very intense day with a 3.5 hours surgery. The surgeon called to say the first part was successful and it looks like the rest will be straightforward (she was most concerned about moving the blockage). 

My question is: for vet surgeons/techs/nurses/staff and especially those at hospitals like mine that are 24 hours, what is something that you all would actually like to receive as a thank you? I've been tearfully calling asking for updates and I even got short at one point because I was overwhelmed, but they have been gracious and dealing with tons of stuff all day and I want to thank them for saving my little buddy and being so kind to me. Gift cards? Coffee/tea/treats? Something else?

A few years ago I switched to Software Development.

I have a full-time job that I enjoy very much, but I also like having a little passion project that allows me to learn new tech.

**Is there an app you wish existed that can simplify/automate some of your work or make it easier?**

* I am not looking to create a new POS/reservation/scheduling/payment processing system, there are plenty of those to go around
* I am not viewing it as a commercial project either, best case scenario is adding something like ""buy me a coffee"" to cover server running costs (if there are any)
* I would like to make something that does not require an integration with other services so as not to limit the usage (so nothing that would require imports from Avero/Micros/Squirrel/Clover, etc.)
* I am going to build something one way or another. For me it's like a puzzle to solve and I enjoy it. I would also like it to serve an actual purpose and be useful to someone.
* I am a terrible designer, my forte is managing complexity/systems/architecture, so I am leaning towards function over form type of product

Some ideas I had so far:

* **Tip out calculator**¬†\- (this is something I am not overly familiar with as management is not to touch tips pretty much anywhere. But I would often see servers have issues with math and figuring everything out
* **Duties checklist/sign-off tracker**¬†\- have seen a number of places have checklists for closing/opening duties for accountability/tracking purposes. Those are usually paper and it becomes a mess to track/print/organize
* **Form sign-off tracker**¬†\- similar to above and mostly from my experience in corporate. I would manage a team of 40-60 staff and HR would require everyone to sign off on a new policy. It becomes a mess trying to get everyone to sign it as some would only work once in a while. Would usually resort to tracking it via excel spreadsheets. Most likely should be done together with the other checklist above all in one (?)
* **Menu knowledge hub**¬†\- I created a prototype version of that a few years back because it is an idea I really enjoyed. I always firmly believed in ""Know Thy Product"" part of service. You need to know your menu, cocktail list, wine list, etc. In the restaurants I ran I/chef/bar managers/somm would put together a knowledge package for a launch of new menu and quite often would include a quiz. Another part would be a knowledge hub where you would have all your menus with descriptions, allergens, selling points, etc. Additional functionality would be having pairing suggestion right there (i.e. I'm looking at new wine BTG and it has links to dishes from the menus it pairs well with and vice versa). I mostly worked in restaurants with extensive wine lists (I'm WSET 4 myself and love wine, so I would often facilitate training/tasting/discussions) and it can be intimidating for servers.

1ghndyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ghndyc/ive_been_playing_a_game_called_neverwood_i_could/,I've been playing a game called Neverwood. I could have sworn one of the character's blinked at me.,"The email came through while I was curled up in bed, mindlessly scrolling through my phone. 

‚ÄúRead this!!!‚Äù 

I grew curious when I saw the name: Eli.

I wouldn‚Äôt have considered him someone I kept in touch with. So, it was strange to receive an email from him out of the blue. 

Still, I was intrigued. The last I heard about him was a screenshot I‚Äôd seen on a friend‚Äôs Instagram story, indicating he‚Äôd gotten his dream job. Lucky him. 

Eli was one of the smartest guys in our class, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised. 

Eli‚Äôs email sat at the top of my Gmail, with no subject, just a line of exclamation marks, which was very Eli.

*‚ÄúHey, Gabby, long time no see! Do you remember when we used to play visual novel games during study hall?‚Äù*

He started the email as if he were reminiscing at a high school reunion, though it was strangely comforting. 

I did remember. I was obsessed with visual novel games as a teenager.

The Persona games were a particular favorite.

Those games were my personal favorite. 

I vaguely remember sitting in the library playing them until my friends had to physically drag me away from my PSP. 

However, I didn‚Äôt recall Eli being with me.

It was always just me or my close circle of friends. 

*‚ÄúWell, I currently work as a game designer at an indie company, and I figured you might like this! It‚Äôs our newest project, and it‚Äôs still in early development, though the game itself and the story are finished!‚Äù*

*‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt you check it out before it goes live on Steam early next year?‚Äù*

*‚ÄùWe‚Äôre trying to send early access to some well-known streamers, but it‚Äôs taking a while :) If I remember correctly, you‚Äôre into this sort of thing, right? Neverwood is completely up your alley.‚Äù*

Underneath the initial paragraph was a link, and intrigued, I clicked on it. 

Another window‚Äîwhat looked like a download wizard‚Äîcame up.

*‚ÄúLet me know what you think! I spent two years on this game, so I would appreciate your feedback! If I had to describe it, I would say it‚Äôs Persona, but more slice-of-life lol. There‚Äôs a school setting, and it focuses on making attachments, so no superpowers ;)‚Äù*

I rolled my eyes at that. Eli hadn‚Äôt changed.

I loaded up the download wizard, which went through the specs I needed to play the game, and then the usual terms and conditions that I automatically skipped through. 

I could see some of the imagery in the background. It was a window looking out into a sky filled with stars and a crescent moon. I don‚Äôt know why I expected something similar to Stardew Valley, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The art seemed to be hand-drawn, with no pixels in sight. It was cozy. 

It reminded me of Welcome to Nightvale. The game was easy to download. 

It took maybe five minutes of staring at a rapidly changing progress bar, skipping from 10% to 50% and then back to 3% before the game finally loaded up. 

It was surprisingly well-made.

The game started with an almost cinematic scene involving a first-person point of view of a car ride. 

There was no voice acting, only text boxes popping up in varying shades of purple which I thought was a nice touch. 

I was introduced to eighteen-year-old Maddy, a wallflower, returning home after a summer away at camp. 

Driving through an idealistic-looking town, the animation was smooth, with no glitches or lag. 

The whole town of Neverwood was displayed in several flashes framed in a photographic collage and polaroids pinned to Maddy‚Äôs bedroom walls.

I figured these were all playable locations in the game. I saw a diner, a coffee shop, and a school. 

The music was what I can only describe as Lofi, while other characters were introduced through cryptic texts and blurred-out figures in the glow of the late-setting sun. Maddy herself frowned at a photo of her and a guy, whose face was blocked by her finger. 

Again, whoever did the art for this game was talented.

The smooth colors blending with the interface made it feel cozy and warm.

These people looked‚Ä¶ real. Sure, I could tell they were hand-drawn sprites that had clearly had a lot of thought and passion put into them.

But they looked and acted like real people. 

The animation was flawless. 

Eli and his colleagues had definitely taken inspiration from Life is Strange.

Immediately, the game‚Äôs visuals drew me in. Cyberpunk colors, vivid reds and purples blurred together in the vaporwave of traffic outside the car. 

The basic story unfolded through the narrative. In a written monologue and through snapshots of texts left on read and missed phone calls, Maddy vowed to actually try in her senior year.

She already had friends but had never really tried with them, always backing out of plans or making excuses. The animation ended with her lying in bed, and I loved how her room was decorated. 

Maddy lay in bed, staring at the sky and thinking about how she wanted to go stargazing with her friends‚Äîfriends she had pushed away, when a notification popped up on her phone from one of the blurry faces in the polaroid montage. 

There was a heart emoji next to his name.

**‚ÄúHey, do you want to talk?‚Äù**

The text box displayed her thoughts, and the interface lit up.

I had to click on something glowing behind her. 

Another photograph. 

This time, I could see the face, a smiling brunette with freckles. The art was beautiful, even for the other characters.

Violet didn‚Äôt fully reveal their story until we had solved the food poisoning mystery. 

Yes, they were a thing and yes, just as I thought, Violet‚Äôs family wasn‚Äôt exactly supportive. So, my main character was bisexual and in love with her best friend. 

I got an award for solving the mystery in record time, and Violet gave me a present, a bag of diamonds I could spend at the mall, though I couldn‚Äôt interact with it yet.

After solving the mystery with Violet and playing a pretty fun mini-game that involved catching the culprit by throwing watermelons at him, the game took me back to the school, where I presumed the next part of the story would begin. 

I had been playing non-stop for two days, only pausing for work and eating. 

So, I took a break.

I searched for the game online, but there was no mention of it.

Curious, I went on Twitch to see if Eli had managed to convince some streamers to play it, but no such luck. 

Last night, I had several hours to kill, so I hopped back onto Neverwood‚Äîonly to have Penn jump straight at me the second I loaded back to my last save point, which was outside the school. His sprite was slightly bigger than usual, overlapping the text box at the bottom of the screen.

‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù Penn folded his arms. ‚ÄúMaddy, I‚Äôve been waiting for you. We were supposed to go to the movies.‚Äù

Were we?

I had to think back, feeling a little disoriented and foggy-brained from work.

Oh, yeah, I had movie tickets in my inventory. 

I picked them up behind a trash can in the town square, only to get a snide comment from Jude, who was standing several feet away. 

I was kind of out of it when I played through his character‚Äôs story, but basically, he had drifted from the friend group when his mom got diagnosed with cancer and pushed them all away. 

Penn admitted he regretted it, and he and Maddy shared a hug‚Äîwhich I thought was cute. 

I figured Jude‚Äôs character would be easier to talk to and more aligned with the main story instead of being thrown to the side, but apparently not.

His comment confused me. I think it was one of the reasons I decided to take a break. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here,‚Äù* his character said, and he kept repeating it every time I clicked on him for answers.

In my haste to take a break from the game and these characters, I had completely forgotten about the movie tickets.

I had three options to choose from to answer him:

**Oops, sorry! I totally forgot!**

**Yeah, I‚Äôm not really in the mood for the movies. How about a rain check?**

**I hear they‚Äôre playing that new superhero movie! We should go see it!**

I picked the third option, and the two of them wandered into the movie theater. 

I didn‚Äôt see what went on inside; it just came up with: **‚ÄúPenn and I had a great time watching Monster Sequel 2!‚Äù**

I expected Penn‚Äôs character story to start after that, and it did. Kind of. I was drip-fed information about his and Maddy‚Äôs past, as well as his rocky friendship with Jude. 

But just as the game started getting into the meat of his story, and I was getting invested in their friendship, Penn‚Äôs sprite contorted suddenly, before he‚Ä¶ *blinked.* 

If I had been focusing on the text box on the screen, where the character was pouring his heart out to Maddy, I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed. 

Instead, I was stupidly counting the number of freckles on his cheek. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever experienced something as uncanny and strange as a video game character suddenly blinking out of nowhere. It wasn‚Äôt the usual blink of a character animation, which I was used to.

No, this was a slow blink, and I could almost mistake his expression for sudden confusion. The rapid-flowing text that he had been speaking suddenly stopped and disappeared, followed by three ellipses.

""... ""

I frowned at my options at the bottom, which involved sympathizing with him over his and Jude‚Äôs friendship breakup. 

Then his sprite flashed out of existence, leaving me alone outside the movie theater. 

The game seemed to continue as normal.

**""You had a great conversation with Penn!""** the text box popped up.

""Why don‚Äôt you call him and ask for a second date?""

The cellphone icon at the top of the screen was flashing, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened. 

Now, I was playing at 2 a.m. I don‚Äôt think these glitches would have affected me as much if I‚Äôd been playing during the day. 

I headed to the school to see if I could find someone to talk to, but once my character popped up in the main hallway, the lo-fi music in the background stopped.

I thought it was the game itself, but when I clicked on a locker to pick up a bag of diamonds, the sound effect of the locker opening and closing was still there.

At this point, I was considering restarting the game, but I found myself hovering my cursor over the classroom doors I could interact with.

The main classroom, where most of the story had taken place, was usually unplayable during character stories, and I was pretty sure I was playing Penn‚Äôs. 

Still, when I clicked on it, I was let in. The classroom popped up as usual, and I had apparently walked into a conversation I didn‚Äôt start. Violet, Penn, and Jude‚Äôs default sprites were already on the screen. 

Penn seemed to be the main speaker, with his text box flashing up every few seconds, but his words were going too fast for me to read. His usual expression was a warm smile, but this time the boy was scowling.

Meanwhile, Jude and Violet looked... amused.

I was sure I had never seen Jude smile or even smirk before. 

He always looked annoyed, while Violet‚Äôs smile was always cheery, sometimes flashing a heart with her hands.

These expressions were different, though I couldn‚Äôt explain why. 

These fictional characters weren‚Äôt real, and yet somehow, they were so much more expressive in this classroom, their lips curled with amusement, eyes shining.

The two of them appeared to be listening to Penn‚Äôs rant, which was getting progressively harder to make out.

So, I took a screenshot and managed to capture at least part of it:

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just LISTEN TO ME?‚Äù

His sprite was going crazy, expressions flickering from happy to sad to annoyed.

I took another screenshot, though this one was kind of blurry: ‚ÄúThe SAME day OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AREN‚ÄôT YOU TIRED? VIOLET, YOU‚Äî‚Äù

I could feel my stomach twisting into knots.

‚Äú‚ÄîSO MANY TIMES, AND IT‚ÄôS LIKE WE‚ÄôRE STUCK. WE‚ÄôRE STUCK RELIVING THIS SAME DAY, THIS SAME WEEK, THIS SAME YEAR, AND I‚ÄôM SCARED BECAUSE YOU GUYS LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. LIKE I‚ÄôM CRAZY. AND I‚ÄôM NOT [FUCKING] CRAZY, I‚ÄôM TELLING YOU WE‚Äî‚Äù

I stopped taking snapshots when the text stopped flowing. This time, Penn‚Äôs sprite turned directly toward me, and I saw it. 

I saw his expression twist into disgust, his lip curling. It was so human, so normal, like I was staring at a living, breathing person through that animation. I almost closed the laptop, but part of me wanted him to continue.

‚ÄúWhat the [FUCK] are you doing here?‚Äù

His curse words appeared in bolded gibberish I could just make out.

Penn‚Äôs sprite overlapped the text again. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be playing mini-games?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLeave.‚Äù The character told me.

Me.

Not Maddy, the game‚Äôs protagonist.

Me.

The player.

I had no way to communicate back because there was no option. As I stared stupidly at my screen, he turned back to the others.

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù The text popped up again, and his eyes were suddenly far too human, too haunted. ‚ÄúI know I sound crazy‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYeahhhh.‚Äù Jude‚Äôs sprite came up, mid-eye-roll. This time, he was wearing his coffee shop apron, which was either a glitch or something else. Just like Penn, he was more expressive than usual, smiling more than I had ever seen. 

‚ÄúWhat exactly are you trying to tell us?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou heard him,‚Äù Violet‚Äôs sprite was grinning. ‚ÄúHe says we‚Äôre video game characters! Which is a good one!‚Äù 

She turned to look directly at me, her head cocking to the side in one swift burst of animation. ‚ÄúSooo, that would mean every choice I make is someone else‚Äôs?‚Äù

The desk suddenly flipped over next to her, and her smile widened. ‚ÄúFalse! Because I just used my own free will to kick that desk over. So, in conclusion, Penn is, like, totally losing his mind, and we should get him to the town doctor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù Jude‚Äôs sprite had frozen mid-eye-roll, which shouldn‚Äôt have freaked me out as much as it did. ‚ÄúI knew he was going to lose it at some point, but not in high school. Maybe he hit his head.""

Penn‚Äôs expression crumpled. ‚ÄúJude, wait‚Äì‚Äù

""Later."" Jude's sprite waved. 

The two of them left the classroom, and I snapped out of my trance, starting to close my laptop, my head spinning.

Eli was‚Ä¶ quite the designer.

If he could create a game as meta as this, he was definitely going to make it in the industry. I was sure Neverwood would be a success. 

However, I definitely was not a fan of the fourth-wall breaking. 

The whole thing freaked me out. There was uncanny valley, and then there was fourth-wall breaking. Fictional characters acknowledging your existence was‚Ä¶ something else.

I was ready to exit the game when Penn‚Äôs sprite jumped over the text box.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

His sprite got uncomfortably close. ‚ÄúDon't leave me.‚Äù

The text flashed up, and I couldn‚Äôt look at his face because I could almost trick myself into believing it was a real person speaking to me. 

The mix of agony and confusion in his eyes was too human, too real. ‚ÄúI know you want to quit, and I can understand that I‚Äôm freaking you out,‚Äù his text appeared a little slower, and I could imagine a real person taking deep breaths through ellipses. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm the only one who thinks like this. I don‚Äôt think there was ever a time when I wasn‚Äôt aware of what was going on. I have solved the mystery at our school over a thousand times. I‚Äôve been on so many dates with the main character, and each one is the same.‚Äù 

I was surprised by his *face-palm* animation. 

‚ÄúI come to school, and I go home, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like living when I‚Äôm awake.‚Äù 

His sprite ducked his head, and something warm slid up my throat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs torture. I don‚Äôt want to be awake anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be aware of this existence because this existence‚Ä¶?‚Äù The text box was empty for a moment while he pondered his thoughts.

‚ÄúIt sucks, dude.‚Äù The text glitched again. ‚ÄúWhy should I have to relive the same days? 

Why should I have to be forced to count each reset? I‚Äôm alone. It's just me going crazy  on my own. Jude and Violet aren't like me. They won't listen, and I‚Äôm tired. 

I should have the right to end it myself, right? I'm alive, so I have a *right* to pull my own plug.‚Äù His eyes found mine. 

‚ÄúI know video game characters don‚Äôt usually have a say in what they‚Äôre allowed to do. Their entire life is controlled by the player.‚Äù 

His expression became subtly dark. 

‚ÄúAnd I think that‚Äôs a pretty shitty existence. I should be allowed to make my own choices. Who I want to be friends with, who I want to love, who I want to hate, and how I‚Äôm going to live my life. Like I said, it‚Äôs not fair. Being aware of my existence and even giving me the ability to think for myself is twisted.‚Äù His sprite shrugged. 

‚ÄúSo, you can go right ahead.‚Äù

When I didn‚Äôt respond, because I had no way to talk to him, he continued.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a separate folder with the game files,‚Äù Penn said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not allowed inside them, so I can only see a list of names and notes.‚Äù

I knew what he was talking about the second he mentioned the list of names.

How could I deny this thing‚Ä¶ this living thing an end?

But also, wasn‚Äôt this murder? If this game had fictional characters with consciousness, wouldn‚Äôt I be killing someone?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to delete me,‚Äù Penn said. ‚ÄúJust right-click and delete.‚Äù

His smile made me feel sick.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs kind of barbaric, but trust me, you would be doing me a favor.‚Äù

I noticed the classroom glitching around him, and I wondered if him being awake and controlling the game was messing with the controls. 

I got my answer when I tried to open the options screen, and half of the screen froze. Luckily, it didn‚Äôt affect Penn, who easily popped up over the frozen interface. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not killing me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saving me. It's just like going to sleep, right? I won't even know I'm sleeping.‚Äù 

His words somehow navigated me to the game files, and just like he had described, there was a list of folders with one containing the names of the characters. 

I went back to the game‚Äôs screen, and he was still there, and this time, he was smiling his default smile.

‚ÄúI would say delete the others too, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs my choice to make. Violet and Jude can make their own choice, and I respect whatever they  choose to do.‚Äù 

He paused, and I found myself teary-eyed, my gaze flicking through several text boxes with just ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù before he continued. ‚ÄúDid you know I can actually have dreams?‚Äù

I figured Penn knew I couldn‚Äôt reply, but he did his best to act like he could hear me. ‚ÄúDo you believe in reincarnation?‚Äù

I was hovering my cursor over his file when he continued. ‚ÄúI have dreams where I‚Äôm not in this town,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm someone else. I‚Äôm a whole different person with a different life‚Äîand I think that was my past one.‚Äù

His smile made me feel queasy and yet indescribably sad at the same time.

‚ÄúSo, that means I was human in my other life, right? This was just another life on top of all of the others I‚Äôve had, and this is just‚Ä¶.‚Äù He paused, the screen glitching once again. 

‚ÄúThis one life is just a blip where something went wrong. Maybe my next life will be better? I don‚Äôt just exist as a thing in this game, I‚Äôm actually real. I‚Äôve been real‚Äîand when you delete me, I‚Äôll...be real again.‚Äù

I saw the ellipses as his way of sighing.

Fuck. I was choked up over a sentient video game character.

I swiped at my eyes.

‚ÄúSo, yeah, you can do it now.‚Äù His sprite looked peaceful, and yet when I clicked on his name, I still felt like I was responsible for this thing‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs weird?‚Äù

The message popped up when I was hovering over his name.

‚ÄúJude and Violet.‚Äù Penn‚Äôs expression contorted a little into confusion. His sprite changed to a crying animation. 

‚ÄúThose dreams that I have? They‚Äôre in them too. Which is kinda crazy, right? Maybe it's fate.‚Äù

His last message was confusing. ‚ÄúI'll see you on Monday.‚Äù

I deleted him before he could finish and it wasn‚Äôt as climactic as I was expecting. 

Penn‚Äôs sprite disappeared, but his text box was still wavering on the screen. 

I could see the effects of his removal almost instantly, even if it was hard to notice at first. Maddy‚Äôs cell phone was glitching in and out of existence, and I could no longer click on the town map. 

I went back to Maddy‚Äôs bedroom, and the Polaroids with his face were gone, while some stray ones had a glitched-out version of his smile, which freaked me out.

I exited the main menu and was ready to stop playing, ready to purge this game from my mind, when I found myself back inside the character folder.

It‚Äôs weird. I could almost liken it to feeling like a god. 

The remaining names stood out in front of me. I should have clicked out of the game files, but something lingering in my gut, entwining its way through me, kept me there. 

Penn told me he didn‚Äôt have the right to delete the others from existence, but that was just him. 

This sentient thing had spoken like a living, breathing human being despite being nothing but code tangled together. 

He said it was torture to be awake and aware of his never-ending, monotonous existence.

Wasn‚Äôt that what it was like for them?

Even if they were not awake, there was a chance they could become aware at some point and be destined to the same fate as Penn.

He said he had relived the reset thousands of times.

And I couldn‚Äôt put them through that. I had the ability to give these things mercy. I could send them to eternal sleep.

They wouldn‚Äôt know, right?

I was already right-clicking on Jude‚Äôs name and scrolling down to DELETE. 

That word had meant nothing to me when playing games, and yet now, it gave me the ability to grant life or death.

I could erase this thing from existence, and it would never even know.

Before I could delete him, though, my gaze caught the rest of the files open on the left of the screen. Penn said he wasn‚Äôt able to access them, but I wondered if I could. 

I was curious about the building of this game, and how exactly it had managed to create life inside its interface. There were three more files available, the others locked.

I tried to get into the locked one, but no luck. So, I turned my attention to the others: BUILDING, TEXTILES, and NOTES. 

I clicked into ‚ÄúBUILDING,‚Äù which was just screenshots of various parts of the town and some character designs. 

The textiles folder was empty, so I clicked on Notes.

Inside, there was a folder named To You, Love 2021.

Clicking into that one, I found myself staring at several text docs in what appeared to be diary entries.

*03/05/2021*

*I don‚Äôt know why the guys in the office ignore me. Is it something I‚Äôve done wrong? I‚Äôve tried so many times to talk to them, and they stick their noses up at me.*

*I‚Äôm starting to think maybe this job was a bad idea. It‚Äôs my dream, but they make it so hard to enjoy it.*

*I made a new friend, at least. He‚Äôs a true crime freak, so at least we have something to talk about. But he does talk about it in extensive detail. I was like, ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre scaring HER,‚Äù and he looked at me kinda funny. Does he like her? I mean, she's been flirting with me for months, so obviously not. But the way she looks at him does make me suspicious.*

That was the point I wish I stopped digging around these files. 

I don‚Äôt know why, but I kept going down the list, clicking on each entry.

*03/06/2021.*

*They stole my ideas today and laughed in my face. Mom says I should talk to someone, but WHO do I talk to? This is the real world, I shouldn‚Äôt be getting bullied like in high school! This isn‚Äôt fucking fair. THIS IS MY JOB. WHY ARE THEY*

*RUINING It? I asked her on a date, and she says she has plans. I've asked her out every single day and it's always that she's busy and never has time, but now she has plans? Who does she have plans with??*

*03/09/2021.*

*I took a break to start on the game. We‚Äôre calling it Neverwood. It's my idea, and they‚Äôre the ones getting the glory. At lunch, that bitch rejected me again. Does she not understand that I see her? There are so many people here and yet I‚Äôm the only one who truly SEES her for who she really is.*

*She‚Äôs a bitch for making her way through our whole studio, and not even looking in my direction. It won‚Äôt be long before she goes for HIM. I know she has a thing for him, but of course he's playing hard to get.*

*It's painful to watch. He's also got a new friend, some new guy who looks at me like I'm dirt. I've got a bad feeling about this guy. He's like a sociopath.*

*When he DOES communicate with me, he's talking down to me like I'm a child. The asshole never smiles. I caught him talking to the other two today. I hope he gets the hint that he's not welcome.*
 
*03/15/2021*

*I was right. I‚Äôm supposed to be using this stupid diary for game progress, but I was RIGHT. They hooked up. I never liked her. Also, the new guy has joined the team. I already hate him. I'm not a fucking coffee boy. What the fuck is a grande frappacino?*

*03/18/2021*

*I love her. I fucking love her, why can‚Äôt she see that? Why can‚Äôt she see me? 

*I hate that nobody looks at me and when they do they look at me like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with me. I had friends in high school, so why are people assholes in the workplace??? I can‚Äôt HELP being the smartest here.*

*I saw the three of them acting all cosy this morning. I'm talking leaning on each other. I think they spent the night together. Did she fuck both of them? Does that count as inappropriate behavior in the office????*

*I should be the one taking the credit for a game and an idea that is mine. Not HIMDJKDFJKDJFKDJFKDJFKSJKDHSFJSDHFJDSHJFHSJHFJHDSJGHDSJHGJASHDJHKASJKFDJKGJDKGJK*

*03/20/21.*

*They‚Äôre killing me. I don‚Äôt think I can do this anymore. They think they‚Äôre smarter than me. They think they‚Äôre BETTER than me. They're actually dating. She picked both of them and I'm just the coffee boy?? Who the fuck do they think they are???*

*03/28/21.*

*I‚Äôm going to try to clear the air with them tonight! Neverwood has just met our first deadline and I think we can make this work. I think I can get her to look at me.*

*I know she doesn't really like them like*that*. She's just confused. I'll talk to her. I'll tell her she's confused, and maybe we can hang out. She did speak to me first. That means I get first dibs, right? I'm smarter than them, and I'll show her that.* 
 
The entries jumped forward, a whole month later. I don‚Äôt know why I clicked on it, on this clear descent into insanity.

*04/15/2021.*

*Do you know how easy it is to hide a body when you know exactly how to dismember it? For a slut, it's easy. I made her know that she's nothing without me.*

*That asshole may be the true crime freak, but I‚Äôm the one dumping his body.*

*It was easier than I thought! I didn‚Äôt freak out or barf, it felt right, you know? He was the hardest. I used to really like him.*

*But once he started running off his mouth, I was done. He didn't even see me picking up the paperweight. I'm glad he told me all about pressure points, because I'm sure one smack against the temple is pretty killer.*

*Then I killed his best friend. Not before I had fun with him the asshole first. They've been looking down on me since I started this job. I gave him life, and then I ended it. Just like that! :D hey, like video game characters!*

*She wasn‚Äôt quite as easy. Because I wanted her before I killed her.*

*And the bitch didn‚Äôt even let me have that.*

*Fuck her. If I get caught for this, I‚Äôm never telling where the bodies are.* 

*Because there are none! LOL.*

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. 

Penn's words came back to me like lightning bolts. 

*I dream of another life...*

Stop reading.

I tried to, but something kept my eyes glued to my laptop screen, because I was starting to put pieces of this puzzle together, and the closer I was to coming to that inevitable truth, I could feel my stomach creeping into the bridge of my throat. 

The next text note had an image attached, and once it loaded up, I did throw up. 

It was hot and sticky and wet all over my hands and the blankets of my bed, but I was still staring at my screen, still trying to find a logical reason for why this image existed and had been carelessly thrown onto the doc like it was nothing.

Initially, I could just make out the white porcelain of a bathtub. 

I saw the splatters straight away, severed limbs piled on top of each other. These people had no identities. 

Not anymore. 

This psychopath had taken them away, skinned them of their faces, of who they were, and left them discarded mounds of flesh.  

I could see where they had been cruelly sliced through for nothing but sickening pleasure.

I glimpsed a limp arm hanging over the bathtub, what looked like an engagement ring attached to the finger. 

The next image was a trash can set on fire, filled with what looked like the remnants of clothes and bags, and nametags caught just before they were engulfed in flames, hiding his filthy secret. 

The third image was only half visible, and I could already see half of a face. 

I could only see what was left of a head, but the body had an eerie resemblance to *Jude.* 

Scrolling further, there were more images. Three adults, bound to leather chairs. 

Eli looked like he'd had a *good time*, creating a disturbing photoshoot of three people who bore frightening resemblance to Neverwood‚Äôs characters. 

Penn was older, his hair was grown out and mousey,  but his freckles were unmistakable. Jude was a carbon copy of his digital self, while Violet was disturbingly *plain*, compared to the game Violet, who was beautiful. 

The photos got worse. 

They started as a snapshot of their silent cries and pleads for mercy, and scrolling to the bottom, all of them were dead, their heads bowed, blood pooling across the floor. 

The last diary entry was followed, and it took me a while to open it. I found myself calling the police, and then throwing my phone against the wall. 

I didn‚Äôt know what to tell them, and when I opened my mouth, I found myself choking on my own barf. 

Because what was I supposed to say? 

If that blossoming thought in the back of my mind was right, then I had killed someone. I had murdered someone.

The final diary entry was as follows, and only solidified my realization.

*06/27/2021.*

*I went to your funeral today. And as a gift to your parents, I let them know that you guys will eternally live inside Neverwood.*

*Your folks are so happy. I even gave them a beta version. After everything you did to me, I actually had the decency and heart to remember you in some way. I‚Äôm such a good friend. But you guys know that, right?*

*I know YOU (yes, you reading this, you piece of shit) are intelligent enough to find this.*

*Vi, I‚Äôm so happy that I can date you for real now whenever I want. I've played through your story multiple times!*

*You're an amazing girlfriend. I can love you now, for however long I fucking want, and you'll never have them. I'll just delete them so it's just you and me in Neverwood forever :)*

Attached to the file was a 2 minute voice clip. 

**‚Äúhahahahahahahahahahah.avi‚Äù.**

The sound was a little bad, but I could just make out voices in what appeared to be a crowded place. 

‚ÄúEli‚Äôs driving me mad. Dude, he's so fucking weird.‚Äù

Penn‚Äôs voice was loud and clear, crackling through the speaker. 

I could hear clanking silverware. It sounded like they were in a restaurant. 

‚ÄúI dunno, man, I kinda feel sorry for him. I think he like, *likes* us. It's kinda cute.‚Äù

Jude. 

I recognized his voice. 

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Violet's laugh crackled through. ‚ÄúHe's literally stalking us. Did you see him watching us the other night? He was there for hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúIgnore him, he‚Äôll get tired.‚Äù Penn sighed. ‚ÄúEventually.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well he's yet to get the hint.‚Äù Jude muttered. ‚ÄúIt's like talking to a wall.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm going to tell him.‚Äù Penn said. ‚ÄúWe can't fuck him over. He could report us.‚Äù

Jude spluttered. ‚ÄúThe dude ain't reporting *anyone*. He‚Äôll just cry into his superhero sheets, then he‚Äôll get the fuck over it. He's a 22 year old virgin. Never been touched. If he doesn't? I dunno, man, maybe Violet can promise him a sympathy blow job.‚Äù

A bang made me jump. 

‚ÄúShhh!‚Äù Violet giggled. 

‚ÄúYou're insane, and I kind of love it.‚Äù Penn muttered. 

The three started laughing, and a shiver ripped down my spine. 

**‚ÄúHey, guys, what are you laughing at?‚Äù**

**Eli.**

‚ÄúMemes.‚Äù Penn muttered. ‚ÄúDid you uh, finish the pitch?‚Äù

There was an awkward silence before Eli responded.

I could hear the exhaustion in his tone. ‚ÄúI thought *you* were writing the pitch?‚Äù

‚ÄúNeverwood.‚Äù Penn said, exaggerating his voice. ‚ÄúCome on, Eli, it sounds like a Disney show. We need a new name.‚Äù

Eli paused, before hissing out, ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ that was your idea. Neverwood was your idea!‚Äù

Penn laughed again, though this time it was kind of awkward. I had a feeling I was listening to the mob mentality. 

‚ÄúUh no, I didn't. Do you have like, freakin‚Äô amnesia?‚Äù 

Penn‚Äôs voice was cruel, biting into me. But part of me understood. 

He was being cruel to be kind. 

Instead of leading Eli on, he was  cutting him loose. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the ones doing the work while you sit on your ass,‚Äù Penn snapped. ‚ÄúPull yourself together, Eli. We‚Äôre colleagues, not friends.‚Äù

Eli exploded, his voice coming out in a strangled hiss. ‚ÄúI *have* been doing all the work! You three fucking *stole* my idea!‚Äù 

There was an awkward silence, before he spoke again. 

‚ÄúPenn,‚Äù his voice was pleading, ‚Äúwhy do you even hang around with him? Can't you see he's an asshole? You didn't even like him at first. Didn't you call him a pretentious asshole?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, wow, *thanks*.‚Äù Jude exaggerated a cough. ‚ÄúI am *so* sorry for hurting your wittle feelings at the ripe age of fucking twenty two.‚Äù I could practically hear his eyes rolling. He snorted. ‚ÄúGet a grip, Eli.‚Äù

Eli, to my dismay, continued. 

‚ÄúPenn.‚Äù He spat. ‚ÄúWhy are you *doing* this to me?‚Äù His voice cracked into a yell, and I could sense the awkwardness. ‚ÄúWhy do you even hang around with *him*?‚Äù

Jude snorted again. ‚ÄúDoing what? All right, since my boy is too fucking nice, we don't want you here. You're weird, Eli. You stalk us on nights out and stand outside my apartment for hours‚Äì doing what? Do you want me to let you in? Do you want to *fuck* me?‚Äù

Eli‚Äôs voice was more of a sharp breath, straight into the speaker. ‚ÄúViolet invited me.‚Äù 

Jude groaned. ‚ÄúAs a *joke*!‚Äù

‚ÄúJude.‚Äù Penn‚Äôs tone was a warning, cutting him off. He sighed. ‚ÄúEli, just go home, okay? I'll see you on Monday.‚Äù

When the clip ended, my stomach was trying to projectile into my throat.

This time, I threw my laptop on the floor. 

I needed to break it, but what would breaking it do? 

I fell into a frenzy, my thoughts dancing, and snatched it back up, placing it back on my bed as gently as possible, my gut twisting. It was like I was handling bodies.

I kind of was.

I remember hitting the floor knees first, my head spinning off of its axis.

I killed someone.

Penn's words came into my mind, and my stomach heaved again, phantom bugs skittering up my spine. *It's fate.* 

*It's fate that we always find each other, like something is pulling us together.*

It wasn't‚Ä¶fate.

I had killed the last parts of him holding on.

The remnants entwined inside this psycho game. 

And I almost killed two others.

I was staring at my phone, mentally coercing the words, ‚Äúmurder‚Äù in my mind when a text notification popped up from Eli:

‚Äú**Did you enjoy the game, Gabs? ;D‚Äù**

I went back to the game, all too aware *something* was wrong with Jude and Violet. 

The cellphone icon kept glitching. Violet was calling me‚Äì or *trying* to call me. 

**Don't answer it.** Jude‚Äôs sprite popped up *over* the start-up screen. His sprite switches to his *rolling eyes* expression. 

**Violet isn't awake. Leave her alone.**

He was pissed, his arms folded. 

**What the [FUCK] did he do? Is he insane? Where did he go?‚Äù**

His eyes flicked to *me*, and I felt myself go still, my breath stuck in my throat. 

**‚ÄùDid YOU do this, [ELI?]‚Äù** Jude demanded. His face started to contort. 

**‚ÄùDIDYOUFUCKingwAKEHIMUP!!!??!?!?? 27283727737272728288383nnmm!??????+‚Äù**

I slammed my laptop shut, but it was overheating in my lap. 

A knock on my door startled me, and, with a foggy head, I stumbled downstairs. 

However, when my hand wrapped around the handle, I saw the figure standing outside. 

The figure with no discernible face, a shadow bleeding into existence. 

I blinked, and my front door *glitched*, blurring in and out of view. 

When my phone buzzed, I pulled it out, something slimy creeping up my throat. 

**Can you help me find my body? :(?**

I couldn't reply, and another text popped up. 

**Gabby? It's me. Can you help me find my head? I can't find it :(**

**Please, Gabby. Open the door. I can't find my head.**

","Bluetooth Earphones with Active Noise Cancellation We all know that feeling of putting on a pair of earphones, pressing play on our favorite song, and suddenly the world seems to disappear. But what if I told you there‚Äôs a way to make that experience even better? If you‚Äôve ever used Bluetooth earphones with¬†**Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)**, you know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. They‚Äôve transformed the way we interact with music, podcasts, and even phone calls. If you haven‚Äôt yet experienced the magic of ANC Bluetooth earphones, you‚Äôre in for a treat.

Bluetooth earphones have been around for a while, offering the freedom to move without the hassle of wires. But what happens when you combine that convenience with ANC technology? You get a pair of earphones that not only offer wireless ease but also the ability to shut out the world around you. It‚Äôs a perfect harmony of technology that is designed to elevate your audio experience. Let‚Äôs dive into why Bluetooth earphones with ANC are a game-changer and how they can truly transform your day-to-day life.

# The Power of Active Noise Cancellation

First, let‚Äôs break down what¬†**Active Noise Cancellation**¬†actually means. It‚Äôs more than just blocking out external sounds by plugging your ears with earphones. ANC is an intelligent technology that uses built-in microphones to pick up ambient noise and create sound waves that are the exact opposite of those noises, effectively canceling them out. In other words, it‚Äôs like having a bubble of quiet around your ears.

For those who haven‚Äôt tried ANC, it can sound a bit like magic. Imagine being in a crowded cafe, busy office, or noisy airplane cabin, and with the push of a button, those background sounds fade into nothingness. All that remains is the crisp, clear sound of your music or the voice on the other end of your phone call. That‚Äôs the power of ANC‚Äîand when paired with Bluetooth connectivity, it‚Äôs even more convenient.

# Why Bluetooth Earphones with ANC are Essential

Now that we‚Äôve covered the technology behind ANC, let‚Äôs explore why Bluetooth earphones with ANC should be on your radar. Whether you‚Äôre a music enthusiast, someone who spends a lot of time on phone calls, or you just need to focus in noisy environments, these earphones can make a significant difference in your life. Here‚Äôs why:

# 1.¬†Freedom of Movement

The biggest advantage of Bluetooth earphones, of course, is the wireless freedom they offer. There‚Äôs no need to worry about tangled wires or accidentally yanking your earphones out when you‚Äôre walking, working out, or moving around the house. You can listen to your favorite tunes, take calls, or immerse yourself in a podcast without being tethered to your phone or computer.

Pair this with ANC technology, and you‚Äôve got a winning combination. You can move freely while still enjoying a noise-free audio experience. Whether you‚Äôre commuting, running errands, or doing chores around the house, Bluetooth earphones with ANC let you carry your music and podcasts wherever you go‚Äîwithout interruption.

# 2.¬†Enhanced Focus and Productivity

For those who work or study in busy environments, focusing can be a challenge. Background noise, whether it‚Äôs co-workers talking, traffic outside, or the hum of machinery, can be incredibly distracting. Bluetooth earphones with ANC help to block out those distractions, creating a more peaceful space to concentrate.

Imagine being able to tune out all the noise around you and really zero in on the task at hand. Whether you‚Äôre reading, writing, or simply trying to think, having that quiet space can make a huge difference in productivity. Bluetooth earphones with ANC let you carry that focus with you wherever you go.

# 3.¬†Improved Travel Experience

Travelers, especially frequent flyers, know the struggle of dealing with constant background noise. The drone of an airplane engine, the chatter of fellow passengers, and even airport announcements can be overwhelming. For this reason, Bluetooth earphones with ANC have become a must-have travel accessory.

Not only do they help you escape into your music or a good audiobook, but they also make it easier to relax. Some people even use their ANC earphones without any audio playing, just to create a peaceful environment for resting or sleeping during a long flight.

# 4.¬†Better Phone Calls

Let‚Äôs not forget about phone calls. With so many of us working remotely or on the go, taking phone calls in noisy environments can be a real headache. Bluetooth earphones with ANC can help filter out background noise so that the person on the other end of the call can hear you clearly, and vice versa.

The built-in microphones in these earphones pick up on both your voice and the ambient noise around you, allowing the ANC technology to reduce the background noise during the call. Whether you‚Äôre in a busy coffee shop or walking down a noisy street, you can have a clear and uninterrupted conversation.

# 5.¬†Comfort and Convenience

Many Bluetooth earphones with ANC are designed with long-term wear in mind. Ergonomically designed ear tips, lightweight materials, and a snug fit mean that you can wear them for extended periods without discomfort. This makes them perfect for everything from long study sessions to full-day wear during travel or at the office.

Plus, with Bluetooth connectivity, there‚Äôs no need to worry about dealing with cables. Whether you‚Äôre at your desk or on the move, the convenience of wireless audio is hard to beat.

# What to Consider When Choosing Bluetooth Earphones with ANC

While there are many benefits to Bluetooth earphones with ANC, it‚Äôs important to choose the right pair for your needs. Here are a few factors to keep in mind:

# 1.¬†Battery Life

ANC requires additional battery power, so it‚Äôs essential to choose a pair of earphones with a good battery life. Many Bluetooth earphones offer around 5-8 hours of playback with ANC enabled, with the charging case providing multiple additional charges.

If you travel frequently or spend long hours listening to music, it‚Äôs worth looking for earphones with longer battery life or quick charging capabilities.

# 2.¬†Sound Quality

While ANC is great for reducing background noise, you also want your earphones to sound good. Look for models that offer balanced sound with rich bass, clear mids, and sharp highs. Many Bluetooth earphones with ANC come with customizable sound profiles, allowing you to fine-tune the audio to your liking.

# 3.¬†Comfort and Fit

Everyone‚Äôs ears are different, so finding a pair of earphones that fit comfortably is key. Most Bluetooth earphones with ANC come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit that also enhances noise isolation.

# 4.¬†Durability and Water Resistance

If you plan on using your earphones for workouts or outdoor activities, look for models with water resistance ratings. This will protect your earphones from sweat and light rain, ensuring they last longer.

# Conclusion: Bluetooth Earphones with ANC are a Must-Have

Bluetooth earphones with active noise cancellation are more than just a luxury‚Äîthey‚Äôre a tool that can make everyday life more enjoyable and productive. Whether you‚Äôre commuting, working, studying, or traveling, these earphones offer a way to block out distractions and enjoy high-quality sound wherever you go.

From the freedom of wireless connectivity to the peace and quiet of ANC technology, Bluetooth earphones with ANC are an investment in your audio experience. If you haven‚Äôt experienced them yet, now is the perfect time to upgrade your listening experience.

Early this summer, I started feeling pressure and mild pain in the center of my chest. I wasn‚Äôt too concerned, but I consulted my cardiologist, who confirmed it didn‚Äôt appear to be heart-related (which I suspected). About six weeks ago, the pressure worsened, and shortly after, I began experiencing symptoms similar to GERD‚Äîabdominal pain after eating, increased chest pain, and, at times, pain that radiated to both sides and my back. I quickly saw my PCP, who prescribed Pantoprazole 40mg. I‚Äôve also made some lifestyle changes, like eating GERD-friendly foods (though not always strictly), eating smaller portions, avoiding lying down after meals, and cutting out alcohol, coffee, and carbonated drinks entirely. It‚Äôs been four weeks since then, but I haven‚Äôt noticed much improvement.

Do my symptoms seem consistent with GERD? I‚Äôve heard that GERD pain is usually more localized. Is it possible that this all began with chest pressure, or is the chest pressure likely unrelated? Any guidance would be appreciated, thank you. ",2,1730516728.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

For the past year-ish I‚Äôve been using a DF64 gen 2 with a Bambino Plus. Also have a 6 year old Jura S8 superauto that my wife still often uses on busy mornings. 

I love the hobby, and want to up my game. Ready to buy a new machine to use for a minimum of 5 years. So mid-game, not necessarily end game. Midlife crisis, not retirement. I plan to then upgrade the grinder in a year or two. 

Here‚Äôs where the fun begins. At work we have a rewards system where employees can recognize good work from colleagues with points that can be redeemed on a website. Redemptions can be actual goods, like TVs, blenders, or basketballs (at terrible exchange rates), or they can be redeemed for gift cards. I have about $3,000 saved up in this system. I plan to trade it for $3,000 in Amazon gift cards, then use those to buy Visa gift cards, which I will use for an espresso machine (unless anyone has a better idea for how to exchange my credits for coffee making goodness). I am willing to throw in another $1,500 or so in cash. 

I think I would like a dual-boiler setup, with PID. Aesthetics are important for the spousal factor and maximum enjoyment. I will consider wood trim upgrades for the instagramability, even if I don‚Äôt plan to post any pics on instagram. 



GUIDANCE FROM THE GURUS? 

So, question 1) Anyone want to convince me I don‚Äôt need/want dual-boiler? 

Question 2) Hard as it is, I‚Äôm willing to be patient and continue setting aside cash to increase the budget, if it‚Äôs worth it. This would mean delaying a grinder upgrade. Can you convince me it‚Äôs worth waiting for something more expensive? For what and why? 

Question 3) With all of that in mind, what are your suggestions? I‚Äôve spent countless hours on this sub, but I feel like all I‚Äôve accomplished is discovering more options, not narrowing things down at all. I also feel like I encounter a new machine just about every week. 

Question 4) Any new machines on the horizon that either would be worth potentially waiting for, or that would bring the price down on whatever they‚Äôre replacing, bringing something amazing into my budget? 

Thank you for your ideas, advice, personal roasts, or anything else you‚Äôd like to offer. Once an eventual purchase is made, I promise to share pics here, to the only group that would care to see them. 



MISC DETAILS:

Location: Dallas, Texas area. 

Drinks: I drink 2 cortados/day (seeing as I live on the surface of the sun, I often enjoy these iced in the summer). Wife drinks 1 latte/day. We both occasionally enjoy a straight espresso. We occasionally entertain and like to be able to make anything and everything. 

Space: No extreme limitations, but smaller is better. For now and the coming 2-3 years, will sit on a 25‚Äù deep counter with 11.5‚Äù deep cabinets 18‚Äú above. Not plumbed, so reservoir machine required. 

Mornings: Majority of drinks will be made in the mornings (though not exclusively!). I‚Äôd love for reasonable warm-up times and/or a scheduled start feature of some kind. 

Maintenance/Reliability: I sure would hate to deal with repairs or more-than-standard maintenance with any kind of frequency. Currently I do weekly cleanings with the Bambino Plus. That‚Äôs been completely tolerable. ",3,1730516647.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ghn6v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreatorsAdvice/comments/1ghn6v7/if_youre_having_public_encounters_regularly_thats/,"If you‚Äôre having public encounters regularly, that‚Äôs highkey your own fault: a write-up about why forcing your own fame actually creates more issues. ","All I had today was a haterade and 3 aspirins, but I often see people complaining about their lack of anonymity, and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre thinking about the full picture. Let‚Äôs talk about Ariana Grande. 

At some point, no one knew who Ariana was. Does that mean she was a loser? No. She was on the grind. It wasn‚Äôt until 2010 when she‚Äôd finally land a major side character role on Victorious. Before Victorious, Ariana probably had a relatively normal life. After Season 1, she had undoubtedly gotten some level of clout, especially since Nick and Disney like to use their actresses for tons of promotional content. This would be Ariana‚Äôs true first taste of fame, but it‚Äôs likely that she was still able to live a normal life since the majority of people weren‚Äôt watching this one show on Teen Nick and remembering the side character. After 2 more seasons, Ariana had definitely become a standout actress, and here‚Äôs where we pause. 

Ariana deserves privacy and respect. No matter how much she believes that, or you and I believe that, after 3 years on Victorious, and the associated success and fame, there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôd go to a public place, with no disguise, with no backup, and then be surprised when the predictable happens. 

Now, let‚Äôs skip over the the rest real quick; Ariana got a lead role with an iCarly co-star, and continued to succeed in everything she did.

Now at this point, most of us should see the elephant in the room. Ariana achieved a level of celebrity that most people couldn‚Äôt ever dream to achieve. She made her choice to be a star, but once that choice was made, there was never going to be an option to also have a normal life. 

I‚Äôm seeing complaints like ‚Äúa fan saw me at the park‚Äù. See, if Ariana said that, it would make sense that people are randomly recognizing her in public, but the strange part would be that she‚Äôs making herself so vulnerable, because we all know some fans shouldn‚Äôt be within arms reach. But why is it that Ariana is so much bigger than most of us combined, yet some of us are acting like we have Ariana-sized problems? 

If you try to fast-track success by advertising to everyone you personally know, you‚Äôre selling yourself a false sense of celebrity, and you get very, very few benefits, and many of the consequences. For the record, I‚Äôve told my loved ones what I do, but I never made a point to advertise to them or people in my surroundings. Why? Because it‚Äôd be creepy having randos following me around the supermarket. I‚Äôm not Ariana. I‚Äôm not nearly famous enough for people I don‚Äôt know to be recognizing me in public. I‚Äôd stop going to the supermarket if that was going to be the case, and if I have to stop going to the supermarket over self-inflicted false-fame, then I better also be making never-go-to-the-supermarket money. 

I‚Äôm the only one in my social circle that doesn‚Äôt advertise to people they know. The result? All my ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù share followers and fans, and I literally have to block my competitors because the close-to-home parasocial relationship they encourage also encourages people that know them IRL to leak their content. Really, if you ever want your content leaked fast, making sure every single person that ever had a class with you knows what you do is a good way to ensure that without narrowing down suspects. I‚Äôve seen a girl‚Äôs pregnancy leaked before she ever mentioned it herself, and it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs talking too much to too many people if something like that can happen. 

I want to make a point, so here are some examples from IRL people I know.

K: Not popular, very public about OF, leaked photos, leaked personal info, suddenly concerned she‚Äôs being stalked when switching states, even though it was totally an option to doxx herself as she moved instead of just having some semblance of privacy. 

B: semi-popular, sacrificed privacy so she could post her car, daily schedule, location, address, family, not financially well-off at all, scared that she‚Äôs being stalked. 

M: semi-popular, uses the public socials she‚Äôs had her whole life for OF, which actually applies to the other two as well, and is a mistake you should note. The amount of information that can be gathered from your candid social media, not to mention the potential for creepiness, should be enough reason to never do this. M is known to be involved with activities that are problematic, but especially so if you know who she is. Her whole livelihood is a house of cards that anyone can tumble, but no one has chosen to yet. 

K2: Keeps starting and quitting OF, but without any privacy, so everyone IRL is aware and makes fun of her it, which I‚Äôm sure discourages her from continuing, which doesn‚Äôt matter since when she quits, she has her fan club ready to leak her. 

I should note that leaks happen to everyone, if you‚Äôre even mildly successful. The thing is, most of the time it‚Äôs impersonal. It‚Äôs either a bot, or a bad fan, but not someone you know. When it‚Äôs someone you know, instead of having your t*ts leaked, your leak is gonna look something like:

‚ÄúSarah has the cutest tits, what‚Äôs her last name again? I saw her yesterday at WalMart, did y‚Äôall know she peed herself at that party one time?‚Äù

And I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs way worse than it sounds, because that was a made up example, imagine whatever version would apply to you. Like I said, leaks are unavoidable, but what‚Äôs avoidable is being leaked like you‚Äôre a celebrity before you‚Äôre able to adapt to a celebrity lifestyle. It‚Äôs okay to float under fame, because if you‚Äôre trying your hardest, eventually you won‚Äôt have a choice. 

When a celeb goes to the supermarket, they usually don‚Äôt. If Ariana wants to go shopping, she‚Äôs probably going with an entourage, or shutting the place down, not because she‚Äôs mean, but because realistically she‚Äôs not about to go shopping and go home with no interruption. Maybe she doesn‚Äôt care if she‚Äôs seen some days, maybe she doesn‚Äôt want the entourage with her all the time, but she‚Äôs probably going to wear shades, or a hat while she goes for that walk or grabs that coffee. 

The last thing of note is that this job is controversial. For the most part, there‚Äôs nothing really wrong with it, but in the case of my previous IRL examples, they‚Äôve all done things that they really shouldn‚Äôt be telling the people they live around about. It‚Äôs like Bruce Wayne bragging about how he has the fastest black car in the city. Sure, most people will just toast to that, but if the wrong person hears that, then bad things may happen. To be fair, that‚Äôs not a good example, because Batman is rich. He is a celebrity. He can afford the consequences of fame and infamy. It‚Äôs actually more like being Batgirl or Robin for 6 months and then getting so cocky about it you tell everyone for a bit of clout when the real work has always been the actual work itself. 

I‚Äôll close with this. I know a D-List celebrity, and I can say that since she‚Äôs more popular than me, but she‚Äôs trying to be a public figure, OF star, and children‚Äôs book author all at the same time. The only problem is that each of those separate audiences could very easily take issue with another thing she‚Äôs doing. When she releases that book, there‚Äôs a very good chance that instead of success, she gets the entire public backlash of maybe an entire state when they perceive it as an OF Girl lying and trying to appeal to children. To be fair, this woman achieved legitimate celebrity first, and didn‚Äôt simple just keep trying to convince friends to buy the OF, but the fact that she has ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that know personal information about her and are willing to leak it and use it against her, gives ‚Äútalks too much‚Äù vibes. 

Nobody should have dirt on you because unless you‚Äôre actually successful, nobody should know a lot about you including your job, and still be the kind of person that would act as an enemy to you. At the very least the list of people that can utilize that against you should be so small that the suspect pool is narrowed. Unfortunately for the IRL creators I know that think they‚Äôre being stalked, it‚Äôs a real possibility because they only became concerned AFTER publicizing their lives. 

I always say Google yourself, and I know some of these women don‚Äôt, because I think once you start seeing all this personal information about yourself coming from an anonymous source, that‚Äôd be a good time to decide to reel it back a little bit. Nobody stalked you to another state unless you let them. However, this does not mean that you‚Äôre any less of a victim if this is happening to you. You do need to be prepared to go to authorities, and it would be helpful if you didn‚Äôt have a list of a million people that could be victimizing you. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that while the authorities are always there to help you, if you‚Äôre doing something you‚Äôre not supposed to be doing, then that might make it more challenging. All the IRL examples I gave would probably have court dates and public backlash if what they do and say became public knowledge, which it increasingly has, and they‚Äôre living in a fantasy world where every single person that hears you have an OF is going to have good intentions, or even favorable ones, and that‚Äôs just not true. I‚Äôve truly used these IRL examples as examples of what not to do, and it has worked, because I get to be Batgirl when I want, and me when I want. I know I‚Äôm not being stalked, because I simply just lead a lifestyle where that‚Äôs improbable. It‚Äôs the little things like not telling everyone where I‚Äôm going 30 minutes before I get there. The attention isn‚Äôt worth it. ",32,1730516494.0,CreatorsAdvice,2,0.78,False

I first want to say I‚Äôm aware we‚Äôre extremely privileged to be where we are - and it feels like both options have strong positives. I wanted to post here to get outside perspectives and considerations we may be missing. 

**TL;DR: family of 4 with two young kids in Sydney, should we move back into our existing 3br inner west apartment (that we are currently renting out) for the next 5-10 years, or sell and get a potentially smaller 2/3br house that will come with a bigger mortgage?**

If you want to details:
We are a family of 4, 2 kids under 4. Combined income of $300k/year. We currently own a 3br apartment in Sydney, purchased in 2020 for $850,000.

We moved out of our apartment last year (rented it out) and have been living with my parents to save up to buy a 2-3br house with a garden. We want a home that we can enjoy (and that will probably house our kids as adults as well given how life is going). Our goal is to move in before Jan 2026 when our eldest starts school. This deadline is pretty firm, we‚Äôre ready to be out of my parents place. 

Our standing next year would be: 
- $150k in savings 
- $75k in equity
- Whatever profit we stand to make from the sale of our apartment  ($0 - $200k, depending on the market)
- We also have the potential for my parents to act as guarantors on our next home if need be
- Mortgage is currently around $5k/month with tenants paying half
- Service a $1.4m loan once we sell our apartment 

We are currently weighing up these two options:

1. Buy a 2br (or 3br if we can swing it) townhouse/semi/house that has wiggle room to add another bedroom down the line when we need it, have higher mortgage repayments but have a garden, space to host events and be set in a home that we can grow with. 
Or

2. Move back into our apartment for the next 5ish years and do some minor renovations our to improve quality of life, enjoy lower mortgage repayments but be stuck in an apartment with no garden/outdoor space. Try to buy in a few years time with hopefully a larger deposit.

However, we‚Äôve been questioning our ability to feasibly service loan repayments on a $1.8 - $2m home ($1.4M-ish loan, plus whatever cash deposit we have). We could technically manage it but we‚Äôd be eating beans out of the can every day and not travelling ever. My husband is from overseas and we like to holiday and to visit his family in Europe. We‚Äôve been on a tightened budget ($600/week allotted for spending on things like groceries, petrol, goods, etc), have cancelled most of our subscriptions, no takeaway food or coffee, etc. We used to enjoy cafes and restaurants but have been trying to keep our eyes on the prize. If we took out a massive loan, we‚Äôd need to keep living this way just to get by. 

Our worry is that apartment market might cool/level off as more apartments become available, while house prices are likely to continue to rise as the supply is more limited. I also love to garden and have been aching to have a bit of outdoor space to call our own (especially with two kids), something our apartment doesn‚Äôt offer. Also the longer we wait, the more house prices rise, and it feels like our savings only keeps up with inflation/interest rate rises, and doesn‚Äôt actually get us further ahead. 

We have tenants in our apartment until June 2025. We will need to make a decision by next year, but I want to start thinking things over now so we‚Äôre not making a rushed decision. 

Neither of us are experts in this area, and I‚Äôm sure a lot will depend on the market and our savings come next year. Seeking any advice or personal stories anyone would be willing to share. Thank you!",0,1730516066.0,AusFinance,1,0.33,False

I had my total thyroidectomy a week ago yesterday. I ended up being very hypocalcemic, and had a good amount of pain. But despite those two things, every morning (starting 2 days post op) I woke up feeling GOOD. Like incredibly good, like a normal person. My heart rate was stable at 65 with no beta blocker all day. I didn't get winded. I didn't sweat my ass off just sitting in my house. I didn't have extreme joint pain and muscle aches. I didn't have a constant headache. I didn't have nausea. I didn't have tremors. I didn't feel OFF. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I felt like I was ON. 

Anyways. Yesterday I woke up, and it was like I time traveled and I had my thyroid again. I felt absolutely awful. Palpitations, nausea, splitting headache, body aches, feeling weak af, etc. I got tested, and I have the flu. But it felt so similar to graves. 

It made me think. I had been living my life waking up like I've had the flu every God damn day (+ some symptoms). How insane is that? I obviously knew I was struggling, but this situation just put it into perspective just how bad I was feeling. I grew so accustomed to feeling so sick all the time that I didn't realize exactly how abnormal life was living like that. 

Anywhoooo. Today I woke up feeling incredible again. No idea how I fought off the flu symptoms so fast (I'm guessing bc I had the vax), but wow. I spent my day giving my dogs baths, I cleaned my house, did laundry, and sat outside in the heat and sun reading a book and drinking a coffee. Oh then I did the dishes, and made dinner, and now I'm relaxing with a glass of wine. These are all things I couldn't do before. 

I just want everyone to know there is hope. Know there will be happy, healthy days ahead. We can fight this disease, whether through meds, lifestyle changes, treatments, or surgeries, we can do it.

What do I like? Hm... Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, my Orchids, cats, tea, coffee, cooking, painting with watercolors, rainy days, graveyards.
Musically I'm into metalcore, power Noize, aggrotech, EBM, death rock, black metal, Goa trance, 70s hard rock, 80s synth pop, classical music and dark wave. I'm a goth, what can I say? But I also love Rihanna and Kendrick Lamar, so there's that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

My perfect Friday night involves me lying on my couch with a cup of tea, cuddling with my plushies and playing Stardew Valley, while listening to some nerdy podcast about military history, comic books or pro wrestling (yes, I'm a wrestling nerd).

I can't really go out the way I used to because of anxiety around cis folk as well as nerve damage in my leg (I can't stand for very long without pain), but I like having dinner, going to see a play or just sitting around in the park.

Important: I have been on Estrogen for about a year now and that's where my medical transition ends for me. I do not plan on getting a vaginoplasty so yeah.

Most of my friends live far from me or are just busy with their lives and I feel pretty lonely. I‚Äôm married with no kids in the suburbs where most people seem to be elderly or have children. I‚Äôm totally open to friendships with people of all ages/stages of life with and without kids but I feel stuck on how to actually develop meaningful relationships. I work remotely for my job which is great, but obviously makes it hard to make work friends 

Things I‚Äôve tried so far:
- a couple of volunteer groups
- going to coffee shops and the library to work
- meetup.com (seems dead these days?)
- going to neighborhood block parties and bringing a dish
- tomorrow I‚Äôm going to force myself to go to a yoga class

I think things I‚Äôve run into:
- I‚Äôm not great at striking up smalltalk with strangers. I want to get better but I really have no idea. 
- when I force myself to start talking to people I don‚Äôt get the sense that they want to talk to me. 
- the people who do seem to try to have a conversation tend to be people I have nothing in common with. 

I guess I just want:
- to hear a happy story or two from women who have successfully made friends in their 30s and 40s
- new ideas on places to try
- new ideas on conversation starters (please help spell it out for me I‚Äôm hopeless haha)",3,1730514646.0,AskWomenOver40,1,0.72,False

I've also gotten an upper endoscopy and biopsies. I was negative for ulcers, hiatal hernia, h. pylori, and celiac disease.

What has helped me the most is cutting out triggers (chocolate, coffee, gluten), drinking coconut milk several times per day, taking zinc carnosine daily, and using calcium carbonate as needed. My  stomach and throat was burning horribly every few weeks for the last year, and I tried so many different angles to combat this issue, but the zinc and coconut milk combo seems to help the most. Something about the zinc carnosine helps heal and strengthen my gastric lining, and the coconut milk feels like it coats and soothes it. The coconut milk (like a plant based milk, not the canned kind)  just has coconut water, coconut milk and xanthan gum in it.

He had surgery 2 weeks ago but they couldn‚Äôt fix the whole thing so he‚Äôs having another surgery at the end of Nov & this one is riskier because the veins may be connected to his brain.

1ghme7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Illustrious-Nail-652/comments/1ghme7l/what_killed_the_campers_in_maine_in_1988_i_was/,What Killed the Campers in Maine in 1988 I Was There. Park Ranger TOLD EVERYTHING,"The Vermont forest was a spectacle of colors, especially that autumn. But even with the beauty surrounding me, there was an unease in my chest. I, Christian Parker, a thirty-year-old forest ranger, had chosen this isolated life, far from the hustle and bustle of the city. My small, simple cabin was surrounded by towering trees that seemed to watch my every move.



That October morning was cold. The thick fog concealed the world around me, and an oppressive silence filled the air. As I sipped my coffee, a growing worry settled in my mind. There had been rumors about something strange in the forest: unexplained noises and sightings of animals behaving erratically. I had heard stories from visitors who couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the source of their unease.



‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just overreacting,‚Äù I thought, trying to shake off the feeling that something was wrong. After preparing myself, I grabbed my backpack and a flashlight, determined to investigate the complaints. The trail was blanketed with fallen leaves, and the light filtering through the fog cast everything in a more ominous shade.



As I walked, the familiarity of the forest began to fade. Each step echoed, and the trees seemed to close in around me. A growing discomfort settled in, as if the trees knew something I didn‚Äôt. The calm I once appreciated now felt like a trap. I recalled what some old-timers used to say about the forest, that it held secrets. But I was a skeptic. Still, the shadows cast by the fog kept me on edge.



In the clearing where I usually rested, something caught my attention. An abandoned campsite stretched before me: torn tents and scattered gear. The scene was disturbing. What could have happened to those who had been there? The atmosphere around me was thick with a dark feeling. My instincts screamed at me to leave, but curiosity held me in place.



I decided it was time to go back. The path was darker than before, and a sense of urgency propelled me forward. Along the trail, a distant roar cut through the silence. Panic seized me. My muscles tensed. Looking back, I saw a shadow moving between the trees.



I tried to calm myself, but the image of that shadow wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I ran, my heart pounding in my chest. When I reached the cabin, I slammed the door shut, breathing heavily. The place I called home now felt like a temporary refuge, and the forest outside had transformed into a hostile space.



I called the sheriff, struggling to articulate what I had witnessed. ‚ÄúChristian, stay at home. We need to investigate,‚Äù he replied, his deep voice reflecting concern. ‚ÄúThere have been reports of disappearances in the area.‚Äù



Those words lingered over me. The forest, once a shelter, had become a battleground against something unknown. The stories I had dismissed as mere legends now seemed all too real. Fear began to seep into everything, like a dark shroud that wouldn‚Äôt dissipate. The sensation of being watched intensified. It was clear that the forest was not just a place to work; it was a mystery to unravel.



The Vermont forest was more than just a job for me; it was a living entity, breathing and pulsating with secrets. The tall, dense trees intertwined in the sky, creating a natural ceiling that filtered the light and turned the atmosphere into a play of light and shadow. Over time, I learned to identify every sound and movement. The creaking of branches, the rustling of leaves‚Äîeverything told a story. And I felt like an intruder in this territory.



My days were filled with routine tasks: checking trails, cleaning campgrounds, and ensuring visitors respected the rules. I always maintained a firm stance, projecting a friendly yet authoritative demeanor when dealing with tourists. However, there was something deeper in the forest that I couldn‚Äôt quite pinpoint, something lurking in the shadows. The local legends spoke of spirits wandering among the trees, of lost souls seeking peace. The older residents, like Mr. Jenkins, an elderly man who often appeared at the convenience store, shared tales of disappearances and strange encounters.



‚ÄúYou need to respect the forest, kid,‚Äù he would say, looking at me with his piercing blue eyes. I used to laugh it off, thinking they were just stories to scare kids. Yet, with every visit I made to the forest, Jenkins‚Äô words echoed in my mind. There was something in the shadows that awakened a primitive part of me, a feeling that something was watching my presence.



My life before becoming a forest ranger was different. I worked in an office, surrounded by concrete and noise, and the idea of trading that for the serenity of the forest seemed like a clear choice. But now, the tranquility I once sought was turning into anxiety. It wasn‚Äôt just the beauty of nature that drew me in, but the quest for answers. What lay behind the stories circulating? What really happened in the darkness of the forest?



It was on one of those uncertain days that I met Sarah, a young environmentalist who had come to the area to study the local ecosystem. She was the antithesis of what I expected to find in the forest. Intelligent, independent, and with a smile that brightened even the cloudiest days, she quickly became an unexpected ally. From our very first meeting, during a talk I gave to a group of students, I felt an instant connection.



‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe in the legends, do you?‚Äù she asked, a mischievous glint in her eyes. I hesitated before answering. ‚ÄúI think every legend has a basis in truth,‚Äù I replied, trying to sound skeptical. Sarah was passionate about wildlife, dedicating her time to protecting natural habitats and studying local fauna. With her, I learned to appreciate the forest in a new way, to see the beauty in the complexity of natural systems.



As we grew closer, Sarah began mentioning strange behaviors in the animals of the region, as if they were reacting to something. ‚ÄúHave you noticed how the birds don‚Äôt sing here anymore?‚Äù she said one time, gazing at the overcast sky. ‚ÄúAnd the deer? They‚Äôre disappearing.‚Äù



Her words resonated with me. The animals I used to observe frequently now seemed scarce, as if fleeing from an invisible threat. The forest, once vibrant, was transforming into a sinister place, and the stories that had been mere myths were becoming urgent and real.



In the following days, the environment around us seemed to change. The trails grew darker, and the sounds that filled the air became oppressive. Sarah and I decided to investigate together. Armed with flashlights and recorders, we ventured into the forest one night. The darkness was thick, and the silence was almost deafening. The beams of light cut through the fog, revealing the familiar shapes of trees, but also creating shadows that seemed to move.



‚ÄúIt's just our imagination, right?‚Äù I asked, trying to ease the tension. But Sarah's expression said otherwise. She was apprehensive, alert to every sound. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something here,‚Äù she murmured, almost to herself.



With each step, the feeling that something was watching us intensified. Then, we stumbled upon something that would change everything: a clearing, an abandoned campsite. The scene was disturbing. Torn tents and scattered gear suggested the campers had fled in a hurry. It was not a safe place.



‚ÄúWe should turn back,‚Äù I suggested, but curiosity held her back. Before I could protest, Sarah was already inspecting the markings in the ground. ‚ÄúLook at this. What do you think happened here?‚Äù



The tension became palpable. The trees seemed to lean toward us, as if they were about to reveal their secrets. We decided it was time to leave, but as we stepped away, the fog began to close in, and the way back grew darker.



It was a critical moment. The forest I thought I knew was changing, and each passing day revealed more secrets. Sarah and I were about to enter a deadly game where the stakes were real, and the legends might be more than just stories.



The forest, once a peaceful refuge, had turned into hostile territory. The tension between me and nature grew daily, and what was once familiar now felt impenetrable. Sarah's visits became more frequent, and our conversations revolved around strange sightings and the increasing distress of the locals.



‚ÄúBen, I can't stop thinking about that clearing. What happened there?‚Äù Sarah asked, her voice heavy with concern as we walked along a steep trail. The sky was gray, and a fog began to form, obscuring our view.



‚ÄúMaybe we should leave it behind. What we found doesn‚Äôt seem good,‚Äù I replied, trying to maintain logic amid the growing unease. But a part of me knew that running away wasn‚Äôt an option. The mystery consumed me, and Sarah's curiosity pulled me deeper into the abyss.



That night, I couldn't sleep. Memories of the abandoned campsite replayed in my mind, each detail more vivid. A sense that we were being watched grew, becoming a constant pressure in my chest. At 3 a.m., I grabbed my flashlight and decided to patrol the area near my lodging. The air was cold, and the fog was thick.



As I stepped off the main trail, I realized the sounds of the forest had vanished. The crickets, which had once filled the night with their chirping, were silent. The darkness seemed to swallow everything around me. With each step, the tension escalated. Then, I heard a noise, a kind of snap. My heart raced. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I shouted, but only the echo of my own voice answered.



As I explored, I saw something that made me stop. A shadow moved between the trees, like a silhouette. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, but the figure looked real. I wasn‚Äôt alone. I decided to turn back, but when I did, the shadow vanished.



The next morning, I found Sarah in the kitchen of the lodge. She was studying maps, her face tense. ‚ÄúYou felt it too, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asked without looking up.



‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I replied, trying to hide my own fear.



‚ÄúThe animals. They‚Äôre disappearing. I saw deer fleeing the area. Something is wrong, Ben.‚Äù She looked me in the eye, and for the first time, I realized the situation was more serious than I had imagined.



‚ÄúWe need to investigate further. If something is affecting the animals, it might help us understand what‚Äôs happening here,‚Äù she said, determined.



We decided to return to the clearing. The forest felt different that morning. The wind blew restlessly, as if whispering warnings. When we arrived at the campsite, the tension was palpable. The clearing didn‚Äôt look the same; something had changed. The tents were even more torn, and the ground appeared dirtier, as if a weight had been added.



‚ÄúBen, look at this,‚Äù Sarah said, pointing to deep marks in the earth. They weren‚Äôt natural; something had been dragged through here. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt good.‚Äù



Before we could investigate further, a deafening sound echoed through the forest. It was a noise like a scream, but distorted, as if someone were being called back. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I asked, panic rising within me.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but we need to get out of here,‚Äù Sarah replied, her voice trembling. We began to back away, but the noise grew louder, reverberating among the trees.



In the rush to escape, I lost my footing and fell into a muddy puddle. ‚ÄúBen!‚Äù Sarah shouted, reaching out to help me up. As I managed to regain my balance, I noticed she was staring at something behind me, her face pale.



‚ÄúLook!‚Äù she pointed, and I turned around. A figure was standing between the trees, but it wasn‚Äôt a person. It was an indistinct silhouette, vague outlines that seemed to twist and shift. The legs were not clearly defined, and the arms appeared to elongate and shrink. The sight paralyzed me.



‚ÄúCome on, quick!‚Äù I shouted, pulling her away. Running down the trail, the echo of the scream we heard earlier still resonated in our ears like a warning. Fear propelled us forward, but the forest seemed to close in around us, and the familiar sounds turned threatening.



When we finally made it back to the lodge, I slammed the door behind us, my heart still racing. Fear hung in the air between us, an oppressive cloud. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I asked, trying to catch my breath.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But I feel like we‚Äôre in danger. Something is happening in the forest, and it‚Äôs not just about the animals,‚Äù Sarah replied, her voice steady despite the panic.



The truth began to settle in. This wasn‚Äôt just an investigation; it was a fight for survival. We were entangled in something larger, something we didn‚Äôt fully understand. Time passed, but the feeling that something was wrong only intensified.



In the days that followed, we decided to gather information. Among the locals, we found an old man named Thompson, who knew the darkest stories of the area. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù he said, his gaze distant. ‚ÄúThe forest doesn‚Äôt like to be disturbed. Many have disappeared here. Some came back, but they weren‚Äôt the same.‚Äù",0,1730513899.0,u_Illustrious-Nail-652,0,0.5,False
