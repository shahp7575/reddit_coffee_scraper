I don't have enough boxes. It's going to be ridiculous trying to cull my book collection. 



I don't want to. 



Oh *God*, this is going to hurt. These books have been some of my oldest and dearest friends. Both the ones I've read and the ones I've written in. 



The books I've read were always with me, no matter how lonely I was. If I wanted to feel a certain way, I read a certain story, or a genre. I was always so careful to stay away from romance novels, as having not a whole lot of good experiences with falling in Love, so there are boundless books about warfare, psychology, true crime and history, historical fiction, textbooks, self help books, paranormal books, and never ending sci-fi and fantasy. I have publishers copies and manuscripts. I have a book written about the Black Dhalia Murder while it was being investigated. I have Vincent Price's cookbook which was one of the most *mindblowing* moments of history that has come across my hands, and I cant *wait* to make most of it. I used to have some other really cool books like Matt Groening's *Life in Hell* before my ex gave them to his sister.



I've protected my book collection at all costs. I have raged when people have told me that with glee that they have burned books. I have saved many from the fires and dumpsters. We print these things and destroy these things. I've been working so hard on not just ripping a piece of my notebook out and starting over because I've made a mistake. This is just that on the larger level.



We're willing to buy books we don't own anymore for the sake of space. How easy is it though for those books to be changed on the fly? I've seen it, between the paper copies I've held and the digital ones I've looked at online. I've seen our knowledge tank to the floor as expectations and our leaning on search engines and social media sites to teach us what we know and answer the questions we ask. That's even worse since the switch to A.I. where we *teach* it what it *teaches* us. I will not deny the invaluable resource at our fingertips, but this child is new and growing at an exponential rate.. the reliance on chatgpt in the lives of people in even such a small sphere as my office was surprising.



I have an easier time going and grabbing a book or three to cross reference and going through the table of contents than I do using Google now. The old commands that made searches and answers available don't work anywhere the way they used to. I find I'm swearing in the search engine by the 10th or 11th attempt. Some types of knowledge can be found lickity split, others never to be found again.



I have seen photos scrubbed from the internet, I have seen entire anthologies be wiped from the face of the Earth. I have seen history be written and re-written over and over again...



So no, I don't want to get rid of my books. 



That settles it. I'll be looking for at least a two bedroom place for myself. One room as a bedroom because I've literally always dreamed of just having a *bedroom*. A room where it's just my clothes, and my comfortable thing, and not one of my thoughts sitting in external storage around me. I want my bed centered on a wall, with blackout curtains (not blinds! OH Seven Hells do I hate blinds!!!), with an armoire and a closet big enough to fit my fun shoes and have room for whomever winds up becoming a part of my life. I'd love me a walk in closet and a Big Ass mirror, but I'll be reasonable at this stage and accept space for *me*.



I can always get mirrors put on later, I'm pretty sure I know a guy, *haha*.



Bedroom for my body, office for my mind and books and art, and then the rest of the place for what I'm willing to share with someone if they were to stop by and be comfortable with. The last 25 years of my life minus those few years on my own I've hated having guests come by unexpectedly, but you know what? *That's something I really want.*



I want to be in a headspace, emotional and a physical space comfortable enough that if someone is in the neighborhood, they can drop by for a tea or coffee or liquid courage or a joint. I'd die of happy-goo if a gentleman I was seeing would bring me flowers. I'd love for my little old lady neighbor to come by for a visit. Or a friend. I want my door to be welcoming from both sides, not just was divides me and gives me the illusion of safety from my world and the outside. I want to trust the other side of the door and not be afraid of what opening it *could* mean.



I want people to come by when they're hungry. I want small humans coming by to sell me cookies and candies.
I want kisses in the light cast by the bulb over head at night. I want the doorbell to ring and not be afraid. I want to open my door with a smile and fall in love with the world over and over again.



I want to open my own door to something amazing.



*Sigh*. A girl can dream.

### 2022 Modern Witch

Many times people ask what tea to replace coffee, this could be. That’s how lives in my memory some rustic, pre-grinded, stale, home-made black coffee, without the actual roughness. Balanced, very pleasant, it has some milder spice notes, nutmeg came to my mind first, but it isn't nutmeg. Cannot really articulate which flavour are next to the ‘coffee’ aroma, but I find it pretty nice. The aftertaste is slightly fruity, though. I think it is complex enough to make a great cost/value ratio. If you want to ease your coffee crave, it worth a try.


7 infusions

*USD 0.25/g*

### 2022 Lisboa

Very smooth, fruity and elegant, this is almost does not come through as a Shou, more like an unsweetened, hot fruit juice. Very classy, but I am a bit puzzled because Lisboa is definitely not a newcomer tea, as if someone thinks this is a common Shou, every other tea in this category and price range will be a weird surprise; on the other hand, this tea is so welcoming and balanced that I would be surprised if a beginner would find it unpleasant.

It is a completely fresh breeze after several other Ripes. Certainly a great session and I would recommend it to also someone who does not like classic Shou Puerh, because Lisboa is a tiny bit different experience.

8 infusions

*USD 0.21/g*

### 2022 Camphornought Mini

It is more friendly than I thought. Quite balanced on the smokiness, just the right amount of kick. I think it is even more toned down than the Camphire. There are some mushroom, forest, wood flavours in the smokehouse. Aftertaste is more of a smoked meat, than a cigar. Not super-rich, but decent enough to recommend to someone looking for a tender roasted tea.

*Note: The term 'smokiness', may refer for 'smoky' and 'roasted' flavours as well, if you had a different experience or a more nuanced observation, please let me know.*

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1731247302.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

The pepper is non-offensive unlike two pink peppercorn based perfumes from Westside that I've tried over the past couple weeks. Sillage is minimal, and non-obtrusive. But decent lasting power.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

I know how life is already so hard on him and how he have to be careful what to touch, washing hands multiple times when he think something dirty touched them, the stress of leaving the house and dealing with everything outside even small things like getting his coffee how he doesn’t wanna touch the cup so either use gloves or tissues to hold it and everything else.

What if one day I am one of the things he can’t touch? What if it was so bad he can’t even live with these rules he have to deal with things it just don’t work anymore with him
I am so worried that will destroy him before destroying our relationship 

If anyone have an advice or have had a similar situation I’ll appreciate the help   ",2,1731246645.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

Location: 117-4 Ebisu, Katsuragi, Ito District, Wakayama 649-7172 Japan

~Review~

Theme/aesthetic 

Outside: The outside is perfect. There's a few Santa Claus outside, they don't look all the same. There is also Christmas decorations and and the building is in an other color scheme that makes you remember it's a love hotel. There's nothing that make me cum more than a pink and turquoise building. I really loved the little concrete Christmas tree where the parking was. 
6/6

Inside: there was still a theme inside, but it was less intense. The lobby had Christmas music playing which I found funny and really saved the lack of attention to the theme. We were lucky because out of all the room we got the Christmas-y looking one because of the color palette. We got the red room with gold accent if I remember correctly. I think there was one Christmas decorations, but that was it.
2/4

Total: 8/10

The hotel

Amenities: really well stocked on everything. They had two TVs and they had karaoke as well if I remember correctly. There's a jacuzzi type bath. They give tea and coffee, but you also get 2 free drinks from their menu. The bed was okay. You have to buy the condom, but the place was cheap so that's very okay.
5/5

Food: Not great, small portion. Wouldn't recommend
0/1

Staff: very sweet and understanding. We made a mistake of purchasing a hotel card that we couldn't actually use and they helped us put it back and refunded us!
2/2

Location: 30 minutes walk from the train station which I don't mind, but that day it was raining and my friend's shoes were detoriating on the way there. He had to tie the sole of his shoes to the rest of his shoes. Was really funny, because of that they deserve a good score. (Also conbini was close by so that's good)
1/1

Price: very cheap. I think I paid 4500¥ (that's 4 hours of my work)
1/1

Total: 9/10

So yea, I actually recommend this love hotel. Around there, you can go to a dinosaur themed cave that I recommend. Very silly and the lady was so sweet. She gaves us pens because we walked to get there for like 45 minutes.

Here are the unique features this app offers:

1. Direct Chat and no swiping required. You like someone, send them a message and they can see it instantly. 

2. Core functionality is not hidden behind paywallls.

3. 22 Filters to find the person you want. More than any other.

4. Narcissism and Psychopathy filter for those that desire peace.

5. IQ and EQ filters and groupchat where you can apply the same filters.

6. Schedule dates in app: select from a list of curated locations perfect for your first date.

7. Chat assist: for when you've run out of words both in videochat and regular message.

8. Define your relationship and if you cross a certain threshhold of connections, you're taken off the matchpool so you can focus on existing relations. 

9. Date-safe: Automatically notify your emergency contacts if both parties do not mark a date as completed. 

10. Automated Screening: This for when you are being swarmed with matches and would like to restrict the number of people who can send requests your way. Set a multiple choise question and only those who answer correctly can send you requests. 

11. Profanity filter and NSFW images filter and Profile insight: if you wish to avoid serial daters.

I’ve had sleep problems all my life (trouble falling asleep and waking up) but I’ve never had treatment for them. In the past few weeks they’ve got a lot worse. I struggle with falling asleep and it often takes me hours to fall asleep. My sleep quality is quite bad and I feel very tired even after sleeping +10 hours. I also regularly take naps during the day because of tiredness and they are often a couple of hours long.

I am in a foreign country and despite having the right to healthcare I feel like I’m overusing it. I’ve already visited the doctor for mental health problems and tiredness problems and I’m concerned it’s too much. I could wait until I go back to my home country in a month and get help for my sleep problems there, or go to the doctor now, where I live.

My sleep problems are affecting my life quite badly, as I have less time during the day to do things and I’m often too sleepy to go to places. This is bad because I’m a university student and I need to go to classes, study, and have a social life.

Should I seek help soon or is it safe to wait it out?

Preview:

Was it possible that Crowley was more than just a friend? Aziraphale wasn’t oblivious to the unspoken implications of Anathema’s words. Then again, it seemed unfair to automatically assign romantic intentions to what could have been simple compassion on Crowley’s part. This is exactly where he had gone wrong before, in mistaking friendly consideration for something more. A chill went down his spine when he thought about the night he proposed to Maggie. She had enthusiastically accepted. She’d even gone off right away to call her mom. There was no hint of the reticence she would confess to five years later. He shuddered. He would not assume anything about Crowley’s feelings towards him. He couldn’t bear to be wrong, again.


On the matter of his own feelings, Aziraphale was growing more resigned to the fact that he was always going to harbor some attraction towards his friend. There was so much to like about Crowley but their current relationship was far more valuable to Aziraphale than chasing after a fantasy. He was a grown man, after all. He could maintain a close friendship with someone he happened to find attractive. There wasn’t really any choice. Crowley had become quite important to him. He would maintain that relationship at whatever cost to himself.

I ate two shawarmas today with all the sauces. (I’m doing my best not to feel bad and beat myself up for it)

I woke up, ate a slice of bread with an egg and drank black coffee as my pre-workout meal. I lifted weights for \~25 mins (it says that it burned 96 calories) before eating the shawarma. I also ended the day with a protein shake to make sure I at least hit my protein goal.

So, how much do you think each shawarma has? I think the chicken meat is pretty lean, not fatty. But I couldn't resist the sauce :(

It all started in the 3rd break when she put her password on the phone and won't let me see anything and I started to have insecurities about the relationship and she started going out more and etc., things I don't I was used to it because during the 2-week break I suffered quite a lot and then, noticing these things, I felt even more strange and confused about the relationship. It all started because I didn't ask her all this time and she doesn't know what I'm thinking. After the break I met G20, with whom I get along very well and she satisfies all my desires, she is beautiful, only she is very suffocating, if it were after her she would lock me in the house and I would stay with her all day. He gets angry if I want to spend time with my family or I want to go out without her with friends, etc., we don't argue, he accepts me as I am but the bad part is that I miss D33, then he sent me a message about how I am and if I wanted to go out for a coffee and since then he has turned me upside down. The point is that there have been times when I miss the D33, but why do I tend to leave the G20 for the D33? I don't know what to choose, I don't know what to do, I consume so much... If there is someone with experience and could give me some advice or an idea. I tend to go back to D33...

For me I was on Aripiprazole 10mg for a couple weeks which worked really fast to treat my acute psychosis. However once I became well again, I really didn't like staying on it because I felt a constant need to move my body, and got this wringing feeling (akathisia) which made me keep doing squats and pushups all the time even when I felt tired, because apparently you can be simultaneously tired and agitated lol. I would also talk really fast and in general felt like I was 'on something'.

I switched to Quetiapine 300mg XR at night, and I haven't looked back. I feel completely in my body, I can sit so calmly like a monk but also can exercise just fine when I intend on it. All DP/DR symptoms gone, anxiety completely quenched, especially social anxiety, I feel totally confident in public and wonder why I was ever anxious in the first place. I take one coffee a day to combat the sleepiness in the first few hours of the day, and the coffee actually works like it does for most people who take it (more energy and nicely awake, instead of the super anxious paranoid wreck that it used to make me). The only thing I wonder about is how bad withdrawals are going to be if my body gets used to the quetiapine.

So yeah, in the past I was worried about antipsychotics in general after hearing people say they feel lobotomised on them. But I can confirm I feel 100% myself, with all my mental clarity and intelligence in tact. My only side effects are low libido, munchies with weight gain which I have to take control of, and a bit of daytime sleepiness in the first part of the day. I hope this can calm anyone who is nervous about starting. Good luck!",2,1731245403.0,seroquelmedication,0,1.0,False

","So this happened back on Friday, but I'm just not over the guilt of getting my son (10M) in trouble. I (34F) am a proud mom to my son, who I will name Erik. Mornings can be pretty hectic for us, and I often feel drained before the day even begins. To help myself stay energized, I usually stop by a local coffee shop to grab a coffee before dropping him off at school.

I know we’re often cutting it close with time, and I’ve been warned by the school before about Erik being late. But honestly, it’s only by a few minutes, and I figured it wasn’t a huge deal. Plus, those few minutes to grab my coffee really make a difference in my mood and energy for the day.

I decided to go for coffee again, even though I noticed we were running a bit behind. By the time we got to school, Erik was late, and his teacher gave him a warning. When he got home, he was upset because he got in huge trouble, and he mentioned that other kids were noticing he was often late. He looked genuinely embarrassed, which made me feel awful.

I know it’s my responsibility to get him to school on time, but I also feel like I deserve a small break and something to look forward to in the morning. Now I’m wondering if I’m being selfish and if I’m the asshole for getting my morning coffee before bringing him to school. AITA?

The last time I didn’t eat was 30 days a year ago. I drank water, cola, green tea, and random drinks.

Usually, I don't eat for 2 to 4 days, which is generally called fasting. But I just don't eat. My body naturally gets hot. Now in winter, I always wear short sleeves when I go out.

.

Some people don’t eat for more than a year but only drink coffee or meditate and practice. There is no real evidence.

But I am just an ordinary person. I can bask in the sun or stay indoors. It is very ordinary. I believe this can be studied.

But no one in Taiwan has done anything. If only the United States might have a forward-looking vision for the future.

.

If humans don’t eat, this is the next stage of evolution, but 80% of the current economy will collapse.

I have a special constitution and I don’t want to waste this time. I may leave a record that will be used thousands or thousands of years later.

I am now asking anyone who has a non-eating experimental laboratory in the United States or is interested in doing so to contact me.

.

Babies absorb liquid food to grow, and the soft flesh of the adult esophagus absorbs solid food.

No matter how much damage is caused to both sides, the teeth can still be maintained by chewing gum, but the damage to the body is difficult.

.

I have tried dyeing my fingers, and the color gradually disappears after entering the pores. The plants will feel that the radio waves are different when people enter the room. It needs machine verification to let everyone know.

It shows that the human body still has great unknown potential. It is possible not to eat, but to contact food with thoughts to transform kinetic energy.

.

It is difficult to change habits after billions of years, but someone will always do experiments and research to find a better way to evolve.

As the body absorbs it, it will gradually fade away like stained paint. Whether we can avoid eating it remains to be seen through experiments. But how many people can avoid eating it?

.

Think about the Olympic Games, Formula One racing... these great achievements are made by the best human resources, using extremely high resources to push forward the ultimate progress.

Even if you don’t eat, there is still a long way to go in human progress. I am just passing through a relay station.

.

The economy is turning towards a general direction of development, and people are no longer just obsessed with eating, hoping that someone will recommend a fasting experiment.

Knowing that applying for a budget can take up to a year, the solicitation period is extended to two years.

.

Hopefully, there will be two companies or foundations, and they will be on opposing sides, like the Democratic and Republican parties,

To ensure the authenticity of the experiment, it is best to have three or more companies conduct the experiment together, and the entire process will be broadcast live on YouTube.

.

If you are interested, please contact us by email on the site. The language may not be smooth with translation software, and the waiting time may take a while, but I will reply.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don’t have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn’t have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn’t be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I’ve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don’t have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn’t have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn’t be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I’ve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don’t have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn’t have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn’t be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I’ve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

Also I've never been in a relationship so I deffenetly have a lot of love stored in me I'm just waiting for the right girl to pour my love into. 
Cons of dating me: I'll need you to tell me every day you love me and that you don't care that I'm disabled (can you tell I'm insecure about being disabled )

1go0f4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FengShui/comments/1go0f4p/feng_shui_furniture_placement_personal_simple/,Feng Shui Furniture Placement: Personal Simple Tips Share,"So, here’s the thing: you know that feeling when you walk into a room, and it just feels off? Like, no matter how hard you try, you can’t quite relax or focus? I’ve been there too, and I’ve realized that a lot of it comes down to how you place your furniture.

But to be honest, you don’t need to be an expert to get it right—just a few simple tweaks can completely change the vibe of a room. I wanna try my best to share some easy furniture placement tips that have worked wonders for me and my friends.

Before we dived into it, you might have a question- Why Does Furniture Placement Even Matter? In Feng Shui, furniture isn’t just furniture—it’s like the way you organize your life. The placement of your furniture can either block or boost the flow of energy (Chi) in your space. Get it right, and you’ll feel more relaxed, energized, and—dare I say it—wealthier.

Here are several parts you need to pay attention to:

**Right Position:**

This is *the* rule in Feng Shui. It’s like the golden rule of furniture placement. Basically, you want to position your furniture (especially your bed and desk) so that you can see the door but aren’t directly in line with it. This is called the “command position.” Sounds fancy, yet it’s all about feeling in control of your space.

Then, You’ll feel more secure and less stressed when you can see what’s coming in. Think about it: if you’re sitting at your desk with your back to the door, doesn’t it feel a little… uneasy? Same goes for your bed. You want to be able to see who’s coming in without being directly in their path.

**Balance Those Elements:**

Feng Shui is all about balance, and your furniture should reflect that. Imagine bringing together the five elements—wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—into your room. For instance, a wooden coffee table, some metal lamps, a water fountain, and a few plants (nice, earth and wood!)—now, that’s some serious energy balance.

How: If your living room feels off, try adding a plant (wood element) near your couch, or place a metal sculpture near a window to bring in the clarity element. It’s all about creating harmony.

**Clear the Path:** If you’ve got furniture blocking pathways or doorways, it’s time to move things around. Energetically, this is like having traffic jams in your house—and I’m sure no one wants that.

Tips: In your bedroom, don’t place the bed directly under a window or in front of the door. It’s a small change, but it can make a difference in how restful you feel.

**Bedroom Vibes Matter:** Since it’s where you sleep, recharge, and reset, your bedroom vibe is super important. Make sure it’s not shoved up against a wall or hidden in a corner. And remember to create space for energy to flow freely.

Simple solution: Put nightstands on both sides of the bed. Even if you’re single, this small thing creates balance and signals that you’re open to more positive energy, both for yourself and your relationships!! ( anyway it worked, trust me.)

**Living Room:** As for the living room, avoid placing all your furniture up against the walls. I know, it sounds weird… but pulling the furniture slightly in toward the center creates a more inviting and interactive space. Think of it like making room for the Chi to breathe. Also, if you have a fireplace, make sure your seating is arranged to face it. It’s a focal point in Feng Shui and symbolizes warmth and connection.

A while back, I helped a friend who was feeling really stuck in her career. She had a beautiful living room, but something about it felt off. We realized her couch was pushed up against the wall, and the space just felt disconnected. After we rearranged it so the couch faced the room and added a few plants to bring in some wood energy, Jenny felt an immediate shift! It was subtle but powerful.

**A Quick Feng Shui Hack:** If your desk faces a wall and you can’t change it, add a mirror so you can see the door. It’ll give you that sense of control without stressing you out.

**PS:** The tips I’ve shared here are simply based on my own personal experiences and the knowledge I’ve gathered over the years. I’m always open to learning and improving. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or even a different take on these ideas, feel free to share! And I do hope these tips work for you!!",1,1731244528.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False

Had yet another conversation with her and my dad last night about our relationship. It did not go well. I wasn't surprised bc there has been a pattern. We agreed to all let the past go and move forward two months ago. Based on their actions, or non actions, I decided to have another conversation to see how they thought our relationship was going since talking again. They originally said fine, great, no problems! Then I said it wasn't working for us because you haven't called once, haven't made effort to see their granddaughter other than twice, and only attempt to come around when my husband is gone working. I said this is not healthy, not moving forward. 

Some highlights. 

We got into a very heated fight 2 1/2 years ago. I said some mean things. Not a ton, not the meanest things ever. They said last time they STILL are mad about that. I've apologized. We've agreed to move on from the past. They. Are. Still. Bringing. It. Up. 

I was supposed to have this convo w my mom a week ago. I text her saying I'd call her. I'm 7 months pregnant so need to be cautious of my blood pressure so I wasn't ready yet. I also have other pregnancy related health concerns going on. My mom made a comment about it taking me a week to call her. I said I have health issues going on, my dad replied ""Yeah well we do too"". Okay. 

When we started talking two months ago it was a day before our daughter's birthday party. We hadn't talked in four months. Our emotions got the best of my husband and I can we decided to reach out, tell them we want them involved and to move forward. So we made that phone call. My husband spoke with my mom and they agreed to move forward. Then I called my mom and had a conversation with her about how I want her in my life etc. etc. After we get off the phone, my husband and I continue getting ready for her party tomorrow and we talked about if we should invite them to her birthday party. We decided we would about two hours after the phone conversation. I called my mom, invited them, they said they would be there. Last night my mom brought up the fact that she was mad it took me two hours to invite them to the party and then I should've invited her immediately the first time we talked. 

My mom recently came to an activity that my daughter is enrolled in. I had something planned with my daughter an hour before the activity started and my mom randomly showed up an hour early so cut into that time. I was a little annoyed, as my mother has a history of doing whatever she wants, but I went with it. We sat outside while my daughter did the activity. I brought a paper to read as I was planning on having some downtime myself. My mom brought up the fact last night that I should have talked to her, I gave her the cold shoulder. Her behavior prior to this just has completely turned me off into having any conversation with her. Her actions are a direct result of how I treat her. Then we had plans to go out for coffee after swim. I know my daughter and know that she was going to nap after swim so I told my mom coffee wasn't going to work and she was going to go home and nap. My mom got mad that I hadn't invited her back to my house anyway. Being seven months pregnant don't you think that I would have napped when she napped too?! Which is exactly what I did. But apparently my mom was offended by how the day transpired. I told her one, if she thought there was a problem, she very well could've asked if everything was OK, and two, she could've asked to come over later. But no. It's all my fault. 

Towards the end of the conversation, my dad said repeatedly that, they, as my parents, need to be our priority. I told them no, our priority is our family, we have a daughter, another child on the way, that is my priority. After he said that I realized how messed up their mindset was about how family dynamic should be and I ended the conversation. 

There is no winning with these people. I just need to officially be done. Such a hard decision to make because we were so close prior to getting married and starting my own family. Just sucks. ",4,1731244257.0,NarcissisticMothers,1,1.0,False

it took me atleast 500 hours, most likely more, to create that randomizer but I finally finished it and I am very excited to share it with everyone who is interested. A lot of times I thought I cannot solve a certain problem just to come back later and finding a way. Romhacking can be so much fun and so frustrating at the same time...

Dragon Ball Hunt is a all new way to play Dragon Ball Advanced Adventure!

* New Goal: Finding all 7 Dragon Balls will end the game.
* Itemrandomizer: All Items are shuffled around.
* All levels are unlocked from the start. You should go to Kame-House to trigger a Cutscene that saves that state.
* Random Fighter: In every Level you have a random fighter out of the 30 possible.
* Hints: At the end of the most levels you get a Hint what item is at a specific itemspot.
* Cutscene-Items: There are 4 Items that you get in cutscenes. Two of them,randomly selected which ones, you get from the tournaments now and two from other no item levels.
* KI-Upgrades in 1 V 1 stages: The maximum KI-Bar in the 1 V 1 Leves (like the Tournaments) is depending on the found KI-Upgrades
* Level Changes: Nearly every level got changed to make them possible with all of the fighters (changed jumps and too narrow caves etc.)
* Cloud-Level enabled: Before just Goku and Krillin could do the levels on the clouds, now nearly eveyone can!

Additionally I created a Tracker. That tracker is a easy tool where you can put in the fighter you are playing, in some levels two fighters, what items are where and if you have done the level or not. When the level is marked as done the owned Section (icons at the bottom) are changed accordingly.

To show the randomizer I made two youtube videos:

We talked in the middle of the night about exclusivity(the only reason why I brought this up was because of the distance and the expenses it takes to do long distance). She said she wasn’t ready but we can to agree that we would be just seeing each other at this point. Morning comes around she goes for coffee with a friend. We were suppose to do dinner, but she invited me out to a bar which we had another talk saying that she isn’t ready because of where she is in her life and says we won’t be seeing each other anymore while her friends are all around trying to not let us talk. We talked after in her car (later found out she was still talking to a prior relationship as well before I came), she drove me back to my hotel and said she would drive me to the airport in the morning.

Now, in the last few days, everything's come crashing down for no reason. I can't figure out why it's so hard to get anything done, I can't even brush my teeth anymore. I'm so sensitive too, I'm crying and yelling at everything, I'm binge eating to the point of being ill, and I sleep for 12+ hours but still am so exhausted during the day no matter how much coffee I drink. I have no idea how to get up and out of this. I really was feeling the best I ever have and was the most functional I've ever been up until now. Even when I was on meds I never felt as stable as I was right before this crash.

I'm diagnosed with depression (and CPTSD) and was apparently (likely) depressed for the majority of my life, but I always thought it was a situational thing for me and that taking care of myself like I have been in the last couple months would prevent it from coming back.

I've done some reflection and I've realized that I might not actually be straight, and idk whether its just cause I'm not with the right guy or because I won't be happy with *any* guy. I was wondering whether these experiences are normal for a straight woman:

* Penises, in general, give me the *ick*. At best, they are just another body part on the guy that I'm seeing, and most of the time, they are pretty ugly. My friends say it is pretty normal to think that penises are ugly and that doesn't mean you aren't straight, but idk
* During sex, I like the attention that I get from him better than the guy himself. I want to be treated like a goddess in bed. I'm not really attracted to the guy himself ... my friends can be swooning over a guy's jawline/face/body and I won't really feel anything. Like I couldn't really point to a specific male body part and be like ""Oh I find that very attractive"".
* I don't really get sexually aroused/""wet"" down there except for when I'm actively having sex. And I don't really understand what it means to be ""horny"" either. Most of the time, when I'm having sex, I'm having it because I want to make him happy.
* I don't really feel anything different when I see a attractive guy vs girl. Most of the time, I'm just like ""wow he/she is objectively attractive"", like I am looking at an artwork. Even for unattainably hot guys like Joseph Morgan or Ian Somerhalder(Me and my friends are super into TVD lol), I don't really feel anything for them whereas for my friends, it seems different? Like they become the epitome of ""thirsting"" lol in a way that doesn't happen for Nina Dobrev. And for normal ""hot"" guys you might see at the coffee shop or something, they are completely invisible to me.

Are these experiences normal for a ""straight"" woman?

Around eleven o’ clock that morning, Jim got a phone call at work.  It was from Autumn.  She wanted him to meet her and Rebecca for lunch.  Autumn suggested the nearby Subway.  Jim agreed.

Jim got him a ham and turkey sandwich with American cheese with mayonnaise, mustard, salt and pepper, and every vegetable except olives.  Autumn got her a tuna salad sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise.  Rebecca had a ham and cheese salad with ranch dressing.  All three had plain potato chips and iced tea.

Both sat down next to a window facing South Boulevard.  Autumn said, “Jim, there is a reason why I asked you and Rebecca to meet me here.”

Jim asked Autumn, “Would this happen to be about my asking Sydney to marry me?”

Autumn answered, “No, Jim.  It’s something else.”

“Okay, Autumn.  What is it?”

“Jim, I would like to host Thanksgiving dinner for the neighborhood.”

Jim was not sure how to react to that request.  After a moment of thinking it over, he finally said, “Autumn, I have always hosted dinners for Easter and Thanksgiving and Christmas.  But I suppose I could let you do it.  Any reason for this request?”

Autumn said, “Jim, I guess it could do with you and Sydney being engaged.  I am just so happy for you two.  So much so, I thought I should be the one to host Thanksgiving dinner.”

“Sure, Autumn.  I suppose you would like to do this at your house.”

“Yes, Jim.  I would.  That is, if I can get it cleaned up and in good shape before Thanksgiving.”

“Me and the girls can help you get it done if you need us to.”

“Sure, Jim.  I may need some help.  After all, it is only about a week until Thanksgiving.”

“Sure, Autumn.  Would it be okay if I brought something?”

“Sure.  What is it you want to bring?”

“A turkey for deep frying.”

“Jim, that’ll be okay with me.  I have a turkey deep fryer, so there’s no need to bring yours.”

“Okay, Autumn.  I can do that.”

“Sure, Jim.  I am also planning on roasting a turkey as well.  Mark and Kendra are going to bring a ham.  Simon and Ariel are bringing potato salad and a chocolate cake.  Sydney said something about bringing mashed potatoes.”

Jim said, “Sydney didn’t say anything to me about that.  But I’m sure that’ll be okay.  I can bring gravy if you need me to.”

Autumn said, “Sure, Jim.  I am going to speak to the others, including your mother and Emily and Charlie.  I can see things are already starting to take shape.”

Jim said, “I’ll be looking forward to Thanksgiving dinner at your place.  I think it could be a nice change.”

Then Rebecca said, “I can bring an au gratin casserole if you’d like.”

Autumn said, “Sure, Rebecca.  That’ll be great.”

The three finished their lunch.  They both had only a few minutes left.  They both picked up their trash.  Jim put the trash in the trash can.  They both refilled their drink cups before they left.  Autumn returned to her job at the pediatric dental office where she was working.  Jim returned to the car dealership. 

When Jim returned to the car dealership, there was a message on his desk to call Chelsea.  Jim called Chelsea.  He asked her, “Is everything okay at the house?”

Chelsea answered, “Yes, Dad.  I just wanted to let you know I got everything cleaned up.  And that includes the utility room.”

“Thanks, Chelsea.  You can put that box of cars in the storage building.”

“Okay, Dad.  I think I can do that.  The box isn’t that heavy.”

“Okay, honey.  Any ideas for dinner this evening?”

Chelsea said, “Dad, I was thinking about that chicken casserole we got in the freezer.  Maybe a salad to go with it.  And maybe some breadsticks.”

Jim said, “That sounds good.  Better get that casserole out and let it thaw out.  After it’s good enough thawed out, put it in the oven for about a couple hours, or maybe two and a half.  Four hundred degrees should do it.”

“Okay, Dad.  Something else, too.  Sydney called me about an hour ago.  She said she had an important client this evening and that she’d be late coming home.”

“Okay, Chelsea.  I am going to go.  I’ll see you and the other girls this evening when I get home.”

“Okay, Dad.  See you this evening.  I love you.”

After Jim hung up, he headed for the parts department.  He met with Simon.  Jim asked him, “Simon, did you know anything about your mother wanting to host Thanksgiving dinner at her house?”

“Yes, Jim.  But only for about a week.  I take it she spoke to you about it.”

“Yes.  We had lunch at Subway.  Rebecca joined us as well.”

“Did you know Mom’s roasting a turkey?”

“Yes.  But she’s also letting me deep fry one.”

“Sure, Jim.  Mom’s going to speak to the others.  I’m sure a good time will be had by all.”

“Yes, Simon.  I’m sure we’ll all have a good time.”

Jim returned to his office.  Before his day was through, he managed to sell a new Chevy truck to a couple from Indian Trail.  Jim left the dealership at around seven o’ clock.  On the way to his house, he stopped by the neighborhood Food Lion.  He bought a can of cranberry sauce and a small bottle of Coke to drink on the way home.

Dinner was ready when Jim got home.  Sure enough, Sydney wasn’t home.  All the girls had already finished their homework.  Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay had everything on the table.  Lindsay said, “Valerie and Caitlyn made the salad.”

Jim said, “Sounds good.  Sydney’s not going to be home until quite late, so let’s go ahead and sit down and eat.”

Jim and the girls all sat down.  Jim allowed Valerie to say grace.  He let the girls help themselves to the food first.  Jim asked, “Chelsea, when Sydney called, did she happen to say when she would be home?”

Chelsea answered, “She said around nine, or maybe even ten.  She said she was in Pineville with a client.”

Jim said, “Oh, okay.  Must be an important one.”

Caitlyn said, “Dad, a boy asked me to the upcoming Christmas dance at school.”

Jim gave a rather stunned look, and then he asked, “Really, Caitlyn?  Who’s the victim?”

That got a laugh out of the other four girls.  Lauren said, “Dad, I can’t believe you would call a boy who wants to go to a dance with Caitlyn a victim!”

Jim said, “I’m just going on with you girls.  Okay, Caitlyn.  Who is this boy?”

Caitlyn said, “Just a boy named Earl.  He’s in the fourth grade.  He lives with his parents in another part of Charlotte.”

Then Valerie said, “Dad, he’s in the classroom next door to mine.  We eat lunch together.  He says his father was named after some jazz musician named Earl Klugh.”

Jim said, “That sounds good.  Earl Klugh is a great jazz musician.  He plays guitar, and quite well I might say.”

Lindsay said, “Yes, Dad.  We know you like jazz music.”

Jim said, “Yes, and I always tell everyone it grows on them.”

All five girls agreed with Jim.  Then Jim asked Caitlyn, “When is this Christmas dance?”

Caitlyn answered, “Not until about the middle of December.  It’ll be after school.”

“Do you think you will need a new dress?” Jim asked Caitlyn.

Caitlyn answered, “No, Dad.  I don’t think so.  I have one dress that I’m planning on wearing.”

Jim nodded his head.  Then he asked the other girls how their day went.  Chelsea said, “Aside from having cleaned up the utility room and the rest of the house, it went quite well.”

Then Lauren said, “Mine went okay.  I got some information on the upcoming Scholastic Aptitude Test.  I’m planning on taking it.”

Jim asked Lauren, “When is the test going to take place?”

Lauren answered, “The middle of January.  Our principal told us what we needed to know, the books we should read and study, those kinds of things.”

Jim said, “That’s good, Lauren.  I took mine when I was in my senior year of high school.  I did good on it.  I know you will, too.”

Then Chelsea said, “I know what you mean, Dad.  I had to take mine before I could even get into nursing school.”

Jim said, “Yes, Chelsea.  You spent countless hours and days studying for your SAT.”

Then Lindsay said, “Dad, I don’t know about those tests.  Someone at school told me those things may be biased.  By that, I mean this.  Those tests may be based on things like nationality, gender, things like that.”

Jim said, “Lindsay, don’t believe everything you read or hear.  The purpose of those tests is to better your chances of getting into a good college.  Or maybe even a good university like UNC-Charlotte or Wake Forest.”

Lindsay said, “Okay, Dad.  That’s good to know.”

Then Valerie said, “I found today out about Dilworth Elementary forming a basketball team.  Would it be okay if I tried out for it?”

Jim said, “Sure, Valerie.  I know how you like sports.  You did well in soccer this season.  I suppose that’ll be okay.”

Valerie said, “Thanks, Dad.  There will be physicals at the school this Thursday.  I may need you to come to the school for that.”

“Sure, Valerie.  Any idea what time?”

“Dad, I think my gym teacher said around four o’ clock on Thursday.”

“Okay, Valerie.  I think I can make it.”

“Thanks, Dad.  I would appreciate it.”

About a half hour later, Jim and the girls had finished dinner.  Lauren and Valerie offered to do the dishes.  But Jim asked them to just put the dishes in the dishwasher.  He said Svetlana would be back in the morning and she would take care of starting up the dishwasher. 

After dinner, the girls got their baths.  Then, the girls spent about an hour playing a board game in Valerie’s bedroom.  Meanwhile, Jim watched a basketball game in the living room.  Charlotte Bobcats versus Boston Celtics.  Charlotte won.  This was also the final season for the Charlotte Bobcats.  Come next season, the team would get its old name back, the Charlotte Hornets.  When the Hornets moved to New Orleans in 2002, it just wasn’t the same.  Now, the New Orleans basketball team was called the New Orleans Pelicans. 

After the game was over, Jim went upstairs to check on his girls.  Chelsea and Lauren were still up, studying.  Lindsay was already asleep.  Jim walked to Valerie’s room.  Her nose was in a car magazine.  Jim smiled as he took the magazine from Valerie.  He tucked her in.  The clock radio beside Valerie’s bed was set to a jazz station, playing some smooth jazz from artists like George Benson, Spyro Gyra, Paul Hardcastle and Earl Klugh, just to name a few.  Jim figured he may listen to some easy listening music on Tinkerbell 94 before he went to bed.  He set Valerie’s clock radio to go off in an hour.  He did the same for Caitlyn’s clock radio after he tucked her in.

Jim made the coffee for in the morning.  Then he brushed his teeth and got ready for bed.  He read a car magazine for about an hour before he turned off his lamp and fell asleep.  He tuned his clock radio to Tinkerbell 94.  He set it to go off in two hours.

The radio did not go off when Sydney stepped into the bedroom.  Sydney sat down on the bed and she softly gave Jim a kiss on the cheek.  Jim was barely under the covers, so he was able to feel Sydney’s silk dress rub against him.  That must have woken up Jim.  He asked her, “How was your evening, honey?”

Sydney softly said, “It went well, Jim.  I was in Pineville.  After I got done with my client, I drove to Ballantyne to meet with another client.  After that, I went to look in on your mother and half-sisters.  Then I came home.”

“Okay, Sydney.  Me and the girls already had dinner.  I got yours in the fridge.  There’s salad in a bowl.  You can heat up the chicken casserole and breadsticks.”

“Okay, honey.  I’ll see you in a bit.”

Jim set the clock radio to play for another hour.  Meanwhile, Sydney went down to the kitchen to eat her dinner.  Sydney was back in the bedroom in about a half an hour.  Jim tried to go back to sleep, but Sydney woke him up.  Sydney stepped into the bathroom in the master bedroom.  There was a jazz song on the radio being played by the musician Jim and his daughters talked about at dinner.  Earl Klugh.  According to the announcer on Tinkerbell 94, the name of the song was “Doc.”  It was from 1980 and an instrumental.  One involving guitars of all kinds, keyboards (including an electric piano), percussion and drums.  While that song was playing, Sydney was taking off her silk dress, with the bathroom door wide open.  Jim tried his best not to look, but something must have made him feel powerless.  Sydney turned around to face Jim.  By now, she was still in her slip.  “Funny feelings, Jim?”

Sydney smiled at Jim as she asked him that.  Jim took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and he finally answered, “Sydney, I guess so.”

Then Sydney said, “Jim, we are engaged.  There’s no law saying I can’t undress in front of you as far as I’m concerned.”

Jim turned around to look at the Charlotte skyline.  Sydney said, “Jim, please turn back around and look at me.”

Jim did turn back around and looked at Sydney.  Now, she was on the toilet seat, taking off her high-heeled shoes.  “I’ve had something on my mind all day,” she said.

“Sure, Sydney.  What is it?”

Sydney started taking off her tan pantyhose as she said, “Jim, we are now engaged.  I think…”

Her voice seemed to be trailing off.  She stood up from the toilet seat.  Earl Klugh continued as she took off her slip.  Now in her bra and panties, she walked out of the bathroom, and then she sat down next to Jim.  *Now, this is getting downright serious*, Jim thought.  Sydney reached into the blankets and started gently touching his upper leg.  Whatever funny feelings Jim had, now they were getting even bigger.  Sydney finally said, “Jim, as I said, we are now engaged.  I think it’s time we started acting like a couple.”

Jim looked at Sydney and asked, “Meaning?”

“Jim, maybe it’s time we started sleeping together every night.”

“You mean as a couple?”

“Exactly.”

Jim thought about that for a moment.  At first, he did not want to do that with Sydney, any more than he wanted to do it with Candi when they started seeing each other.  Now, here was Sydney, in the master bedroom of Jim’s house.  She had just finished undressing right in front of him, as if she was wanting something.  And sure enough, she was.  Jim finally came to a decision.  He took her hand, and he said to her, “Okay, Sydney.  Come on over to the other side and get in.”

Sydney smiled at him, and then she walked to the other side of the bed, and she did it in quite a flirtatious way.  As soon as she got to the other side, she put her two legs together, and she slid her way into the bed.  As soon as she got under the covers, she softly touched Jim.  He rolled over, put his arms around her, and then the two kissed each other.  Jim turned off the lamp but kept the radio playing.  The two did nothing more than hug and kiss.  But sooner or later, things between Jim and Sydney would become far more serious.  Before long, the two fell asleep.

 

😊

 

Jim got up about a half hour earlier than usual the next morning.  When he got into the kitchen, Sydney was already up, making coffee.  Sydney was dressed in a gray suit with a burgundy blouse.  Jim had on tan slacks, a dark blue dress shirt and his Chevrolet tie.  Jim asked Sydney if she wanted anything for breakfast.  Sydney said she would just make her some toast and coffee.  Jim took Sydney in his arms.  He held her for about three minutes.  Then he kissed her.  After he made him a cup of coffee and put it in his travel mug, he was off to work.  Sydney would be off to work in about an hour after she saw Jim’s four youngest daughters off to school.  Chelsea would see herself off to her college classes.

Jim was the first one at the car dealership the next morning.  He stopped at a McDonald’s on the way to the car dealership.  He got breakfast for himself.  Egg McMuffin, hash browns and a large Coke.  When he got to the dealership, he went straight to his office.  He could not help but to think about last night.  Jim had only slept with Sydney about a couple times since she moved in with him.  Those times, they did nothing more than hug and kiss each other.  Last night was no different.  All except for Sydney in lingerie, which Jim was not able to get out of his mind. 

After a few minutes of sitting, Jim’s legs began to feel quite rubbery.  So, he decided to get up and walk around the sales floor.  Before long, Mark, Simon and Jonathan showed up for work, along with some of the others.  Jim started off the day with the daily sales meeting, and then went on to work.

Jim and the guys decided to have lunch at the dealership.  Mark, Simon and Jonathan had brought their lunches from home.  Just before noon, Jim drove to a nearby Kentucky Fried Chicken.  He got him a three-piece dark meat chicken dinner with mashed potatoes, slaw and a biscuit, and he also got him a small parfait dessert.  Jim would get him a drink from one of the drink machines at the dealership.

Jim, Mark, Simon and Jonathan met in the lounge for lunch.  Mark said, “Jim, while you were gone to get your lunch, I got a call from Sydney.  She said something about coming home early.  She said Rachel would close the place before she left.”

“Did she say why?” Jim asked.

Mark said, “No, we didn’t talk long.  I think she was trying to reach you in your office.  She just left a message for you.”

Jim said, “Maybe things are slow at her interior decorating business.”

Then Simon said, “Jim, I understand Sydney was in your bedroom last night.  I heard she undressed in front of you.”

Jim waved his hand in the direction of Bank of America Stadium and said, “Yes, Simon.  She did.  And please, let’s not talk about that while we’re eating.”

Mark said, “Nothing to be ashamed about, Jim.  After all, you two are engaged.”

“Yes, Mark.  Engaged.  But not married.”

“Yes, Jim.  What kind of music were you playing?”

“Tinkerbell 94.  Earl Klugh was playing as Sydney was undressing.”

“The song wasn’t called ‘Doc’ by any chance, wasn’t it?” Jonathan asked.

“Yes, Jonathan.  It was.”

Then Simon said, “That reminds me of a scene of a movie from the eighties.  The song was the same.  The female was undressing in front of a young man.”

“What was the name of that movie?” Jonathan asked.

Simon answered, “It was called ‘Private Lessons.’  It had those fellows from ‘St. Elsewhere’ and ‘WKRP In Cincinnati.’  It was a pretty good movie.”

Mark said, “Yeah.  I remember that movie.  Mom caught us watching it on TV once.  It wasn’t a pretty sight.”

Then Simon said, “When I was dating Ariel, some guy told me this.  When it comes down to making out, smooth jazz can be some good music.”         

Jim added, “Yes.  Especially artists like Earl Klugh, Paul Hardcastle, George Benson, Spyro Gyra and Dave Grusin.”

Then Mark said, “Yes, and classical jazz can be good, too.  Like John Coltrane and Dave Brubeck.”

Then Simon brought up something else.  “Guys, Paulina called me last night.  She said Pam’s car got stolen a couple nights ago.”

Jim said, “Yes.  I also understand the police found it yesterday.  It was in a neighborhood near Johnson C. Smith University, totally stripped.”

Mark said, “I spoke to Pam yesterday.  She’s hoping to get her insurance check either today or tomorrow.”

Jim said, “I know.  I told her to come by here and look for a car if she needs to.  I hope she does, but it won’t hurt my feelings if she buys a car from Dad.”

That was when Jonathan brought up another subject.  “Hey, guys.  I heard Scout got a notice at his gas station.”

“Really?  What kind of notice?” Jim asked.

“A notice to move,” Jonathan said.

Simon said, “That’s awful.  Any idea why?”

Jonathan said, “The city wants to build an office complex there.  I guess they thought the land Scout’s gas station’s on is a suitable site.”

Then Jim said, “I don’t know how they could do that.  That gas station’s been there about as long as I can remember.”

Mark said, “Yes.  Luke Holbrook ran the place, remember?  I also know the gas station’s been there since about the end of World War II.”

Then Jonathan said, “They want to tear it down along with a medical office next door to the gas station.”

Jim said, “That is just plain awful.  I wonder what’s going to happen to Scout if he has to vacate the gas station.”

“Relocate, I guess,” Simon said.

Then, the guys heard a voice in the hallway.  It just happened to be Julie.  She said to the guys, “I can see this is the way you guys make a living.”

Jim stood up and said, “Hi, Julie.”

The other guys stood up just as Jim did.  Julie motioned for the guys to sit back down.  Then she sat down.  Jim asked her, “What brings you here?”

Julie said, “I was on my way back from looking at the abandoned church building on Lexington Avenue.  I’m afraid I don’t have the best news.”

Mark said, “Okay, Julie.  Let’s hear it.”

Julie said, “I just got back from that church building on Romany Road.  It looks like the demolition’s already begun.  Now we are going to have to start from scratch.  Something I was hoping we would not have to do.”

“No other options, huh?” Jim asked.

Julie somberly answered, “No, Jim.  It doesn’t look like it.”

Julie and the guys sat at that table, not knowing what to think or say next.  Simon finally broke the silence.  “All this is making me very sick.”

Jim said, “Yes, Simon.  All of us.”

Now, there were no more options.  It was now obvious that the only thing to do was to start from scratch and build a new building.  Julie figured she would just modernize everything.  Folding chairs in place of pews, a new sound system, a new baptism pool (maybe some artificial palm trees around it), modern plumbing and wiring, a new pulpit, a modern stage for Christmas and Easter plays and concerts, a nursery, and even a family life center (replacing the fellowship hall) with a dual stove, a new microwave, a new modern refrigerator and even a dishwasher.  Julie said, “Guys, I don’t know if everything will be the same as before, but at least we can get back on track and get Salem Church going once again.”

Jim said, “Julie, you’re right.  We have got to get things going again.  The problems have been hanging over our heads for far too long.  I guess the sooner we get the ball rolling, the better.”

Julie said, “Jim, you are right.  Let’s schedule a ground-breaking ceremony.  But let’s wait until after Christmas before we do that.”

Julie and the guys agreed.  And with that, Julie left the dealership, and the guys went back to work.

 

😊

 

Jim stopped by the neighborhood Food Lion on his way home from work.  He picked up a turkey for Thanksgiving.  It was around thirteen and a half pounds.  While he was at it, he picked up some two-liter bottles of Coke, two pies from the frozen foods section (coconut cream and pumpkin) and two cans of Mexican corn.

As soon as Jim got home, he saw Sydney’s Camaro in the garage, parked next to his Impala.  Using the remote, Jim closed the garage door. 

After Jim put the groceries away, he went inside and upstairs to the master bedroom.  Sydney said, “Jim, I am moving my clothes and stuff in here.”

Jim stood there for a moment, and then he said, “Yeah, Sydney.  Sure.”

Sydney stepped back into the hallway.  With help from Jim’s daughters, Sydney got all her stuff into the master bedroom.  Jim made some room in his big closet for Sydney’s clothes.  Sydney did have a lot of pretty blouses, suits with skirts and slacks, and many dresses.  He also made a place for her huge collection of shoes.  In the bathroom, he made room on the shelves for Sydney’s makeup, hair dryer, curling iron, bubble bath collection, and her feminine hygiene items.  He gave her three dresser drawers for the clothes she was okay with putting in drawers.  Jim’s daughters cleaned up the guest bedroom and put everything back into place.

After all that was done, everyone was too tired to fix dinner.  So with that, Jim and Sydney and the girls went out to eat.  They went to a nearby Wendy’s.  Jim got a triple burger with cheese, a small order of fries, a small salad with ranch dressing and an iced tea.  Sydney got a single burger with a baked potato and a Diet Coke.  Valerie and Caitlyn got kids meals with Coke.  Chelsea and Lauren got salads with baked potatoes and iced tea.  Lindsay got a salad with thousand island dressing with fries and a Sprite.  As they ate, Jim told Sydney how glad he was that she decided to move into his bedroom.  Jim did want to wait until he and Sydney were married to make that move.  But Sydney just seemed too anxious to take things between her and Jim to another level.  Before long, Jim and Sydney would have to start planning the next step in their relationship.  Their wedding.",1,1731243517.0,writers,1,0.67,False

so for those of you who don’t know, how it works is hermes sends you a virtual invitation. my SA said she has nothing to do with it, so i’m not sure if prespend is a factor or it is a total lottery. 

my husband and i went to the miami sale. you wait in line, they check your id and scan your ticket then give you a few bags to put your stuff in along with a wristband. you do a purse check. i saw no QBs checked during my time slot (10-1130, but they let you stay longer. they let us in at 930, i left at 12). you were not allowed to wear hermes but i accidentally wore my loop earrings, purses were approved. 

walk in, mens RTW 50-60% off. ties, scarves, hats. S-XXL. some was really good, some was really not so good 😂 then the next room is men’s shoes, onwards to women’s shoes which wasn’t as busy as i expected it to be. there were tons of options in smaller sizes, i am a 37 and had many options - no orans, jills, ezes, eldas- lots of sneakers and clogs. the limit is six pairs and we ended up leaving with six. 

turn the corner, RTW. i was SO SURPRISED because i made a post in here just the other day about wanting larger sizes - they had up
to US12 and i was able to walk away with 8 RTW items total between the both of us. womens hats were in the same section as well - i got a hat (i cannot remember if hats were 50 or 60% off). 

the next room was the busiest - silks. scarves, cashmere (no twillies), handkerchiefs, large small all things silk. max of 12 items. i got 12 😂 there were SO many options and so beautiful. 50% off silks. 

before you can leave the silk room, if you have any items they count and bag them for you. the next and final shopping room is the jewelry, which was not so great. less desirable (for me) items, suuuuppper small bracelets - no luxe jewelry just the meh fashion jewelry. max of 2, 50% off. the same room also had home goods - no avalon blankets, but the $20000 blankets were half off and i saw someone take 2 😳 next to that were baby girl items, which were also eeeehhhh (mostly bc i have a son and it’s so hard to find cute boy stuff!) and two of the diaper bags. max of two items, my husband and i both got 2 beach towels each (we live by the beach). no coffee mugs or plates. 

then the bag check. they give you the max number of items you’re allowed to have, but didn’t even count or check? so technically we could’ve walked out with more then allotted. we check out, my total is $10,873 for 8 RTW, two hats, six shoes, 12 silks, two bracelets, four beach towels. i was really shooting for belts, but there were none. when i checked out she asked me for my information because she says it goes onto my profile. 

would i go back? yes. i met some really kind people and my husband was conversing with other husbands who were sent to sit and wait on the couches 😂 the selection imo was moderate, could be great depending on what you’re looking for. ",35,1731243503.0,TheHermesGame,4,0.93,False

It was just a simple recommendation of a new scent from the sale assistant and when I first sprayed it, I was blasted with coffee and immediately thought that this was going to be a big no. However, after a few minutes of letting the notes settle on my skin, I started to smell a rich, sweet and decadent vanilla scent that was so delicious, I couldn’t stop smelling myself and wanted to take a bite out of myself! It made me feel so beautiful, but it also wasn’t too overwhelming that would make me feel constantly conscious about it. I couldn’t stop thinking about this scent, so I bought a full bottle very soon after that and that was how Black Opium - Le Parfum became my signature scent for this colder season. 

Sadly I’ve noticed just recently that I’ve gone nose blind to it. Even after a few sprays on my collar and inner elbow, I can’t smell it anymore. I’m incredibly sad, because I was so excited to wear this the whole winter, but December hasn’t even started yet!

Has anyone else gone through this with their favourite signature scent? I’m thinking about switching, but so far I haven’t found anything that has evoked the same feeling. I have the over red flanker, but I use it more as a summer scent. I did try out the TF Tobacco Vanille and Kilian Angel’s Share for my Parfum Notebook and love their smell too, but they’re both too expensive for my budget. :’(",1,1731243292.0,fragrance,2,0.66,False

it took me atleast 500 hours, most likely more, to create that randomizer but I finally finished it and I am very excited to share it with everyone who is interested. A lot of times I thought I cannot solve a certain problem just to come back later and finding a way. Romhacking can be so much fun and so frustrating at the same time... 

Dragon Ball Hunt is a all new way to play Dragon Ball Advanced Adventure!

* New Goal: Finding all 7 Dragon Balls will end the game.
* Itemrandomizer: All Items are shuffled around.
* All levels are unlocked from the start. You should go to Kame-House to trigger a Cutscene that saves that state.
* Random Fighter: In every Level you have a random fighter out of the 30 possible.
* Hints: At the end of the most levels you get a Hint what item is at a specific itemspot.
* Cutscene-Items: There are 4 Items that you get in cutscenes. Two of them,randomly selected which ones, you get from the tournaments now and two from other no item levels.
* KI-Upgrades in 1 V 1 stages: The maximum KI-Bar in the 1 V 1 Leves (like the Tournaments) is depending on the found KI-Upgrades
* Level Changes: Nearly every level got changed to make them possible with all of the fighters (changed jumps and too narrow caves etc.)
* Cloud-Level enabled: Before just Goku and Krillin could do the levels on the clouds, now nearly eveyone can!

Additionally I created a Tracker. That tracker is a easy tool where you can put in the fighter you are playing, in some levels two fighters, what items are where and if you have done the level or not. When the level is marked as done the owned Section (icons at the bottom) are changed accordingly.

  
To show the randomizer I made two youtube videos:

He’d come to our coffee corner and make small complaints about how we’re not filling up the water tank or he’d say things like “u guys are running low on pods” and he would ask if we have “the pods that he likes” these comments became frequent that everyone in the team became annoyed but wouldn’t do anything about it. So one day, i had enough! I came to the office early, emptied the pods box and kept only ONE pod and took all the pods in my coworker’s drawer (everyone knows that it’s where we keep the coffee) and put it in my drawer. So i was making coffee one morning (i use the frother so it takes me a relatively long time to do my coffee) and he was hovering over me but i ignored him as i was talking to another coworker (from a different team, she brings her own pods but never shares it or puts in the box, but at least she brings her own and occasionally uses our pods so it’s fine) she turned to him and said “do u want coffee??” And he nodded and she looked at the pods box and said “oh u guys don’t have more pods?” I said “yeah that’s all we got” and i went back to my desk and i proceeded to see her open my coworker’s drawer and say “they have some here” excuse me????????? I got so petty at this point, once they went out to a meeting i grabbed whatever was left and put it in my drawer. They came back looking for the pods but it was gone. He proceeded to make comments hinting that i’m cheap and petty all throughout the day and i kinda started to feel bad?
To clarify he is not poor or struggling, he makes more money than me and my team.

So, am i the asshole for taking all the coffee pods?",1,1731243082.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.6,False

I'm 5'4"", ~120 lbs, 22M.

I think before my test all I'd had that day was a bagel, 2 Reese's right before the test because I was a little dizzy, (unsweetened) iced coffee, and maybe an apple? Dinner the night before was definitely just a bunch of dumplings. I got home from work with about 6 hours until I needed to be in class. I used to be fairly active and ran often, but I've fallen off a bit this semester. 

How concerned should I be about a 5.6? Is it more indicative of my long-term diet & health or my currently terrible diet? To what extent should I be cutting carbs and sugar?

The afternoon sun cast a warm golden hue over the small, neatly arranged living room, where Clara sat cross-legged on the soft, oversized couch. Pillows were arranged just so, and a thick stack of letters, the ink slightly faded from countless readings, rested on the coffee table. Each envelope bore her husband’s familiar handwriting, his jokes, dreams, and love spilling onto the pages as if he were right there beside her. Today was supposed to be a celebration; a month from now, Nathan would walk through that door, which she’d lined with twinkling fairy lights. But now, instead of a countdown to joy, Clara had found herself entangled in despair.

The morning news had brought shocking reports from the war zone, the familiar face of the anchor speaking of ambushes and losses as Clara felt her breath catch in her throat. Missing in action. The words echoed in her mind like an unwanted refrain, drowning out the laughter of the children playing in the distance. A month felt like an eternity. The updates trickled in, each one worse than the last, until the day came when the phone rang with an urgency that made her heart plummet.

He was alive, but the relief was miniature against the gravity of the words that followed—critical condition after an ambush. She clutched her phone tightly as if it could somehow bridge the distance between them. 


Clara set the phone down, her hands trembling as reality settled in, heavy and suffocating. She glanced around the room, desperate for something familiar, something that might feel comforting. The floral patterned curtains flapped gently in the breeze; the scent of the lavender she had planted last summer wafted in, filling the void with earthy sweetness. Yet, even the flowers seemed to mock her—their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the gray creeping into her spirit. 

She pushed herself up from the couch and paced, her heart racing. Each tick of the clock was like a countdown to an uncertainty she couldn’t fathom. A month had seemed so short, a blink away, but now it was unbearable—a chasm filled with doubt. Would he still be the same Nathan she had clung to in her dreams? Would he still smile that radiant smile that had captured her heart?

Time blurred as the days crawled forward. The phone rang only to deliver more earth-shattering news. Clara felt the walls closing in when she heard the words, “He’s been flown back stateside.” One step closer, she thought, but the sinking feeling in her chest grew heavier.

When the call finally came from the hospital, Clara felt as if the world had tilted on its axis. “Clara, it’s bad,” the voice on the other end had said, quaking with sympathy. “You need to prepare yourself. It’s… he’s…” Her heart shattered like glass, scattered into a million sharp pieces, impossible to piece back together. “He’s paralyzed. Completely.”

She dropped to her knees, the hardwood floor cool against her feverish skin. The walls of their home, once filled with laughter and the promise of their future, now felt like a tomb—every item a reminder of the life they’d planned. Photographs of birthdays celebrated, weekend hikes, the last vacation together played in her mind like a haunting reel. How many of those moments were still within reach? Would their dreams of traveling to Italy, the sound of waves crashing against sunlit beaches, ever be realized?

The day arrived when she would finally see him. Hospital room lights flickered as Clara stood outside the door, the steel thresholds a barrier that held her back. She took a deep breath, steeling herself against the tidal wave of emotions threatening to engulf her. Pushing the door open, she was met with sterile walls and the rhythmic beeping of machines. 

Nathan lay in the bed, tubes and wires, a shadow of the man she had known. The blanket was pulled up to his chest, but she could see the stillness where his legs used to be, and her heart ached for the life he’d once lived. His face was drawn, his expression eerily calm as he slept, the sunken hollows of his cheeks a painful reminder of what he had endured. 

Clara stepped closer, each footfall echoing in her ears like a declaration of love against the backdrop of anguish. She reached out her trembling fingers, brushing the back of his hand, the warmth of his skin igniting a flicker of hope in her chest. “Nathan,” she whispered, her voice breaking. 

Slowly, he opened his eyes, the warmth of his brown gaze locking onto hers. In that moment, time paused, and the world faded away, leaving just the two of them—the love that had weathered the storm, now tested in ways they had never imagined.

“Clara,” he rasped, that sweet familiarity lacing his voice like a balm for her wounds. “I’m so sorry.” 

The sadness mingled with the urgency of their moment as she struggled to answer. “You don’t need to be. We’ll get through this together,” she replied, squeezing his hand tight enough to send a jolt of reassurance across the chasm that now defined their lives. 

As tears streamed down her face, she leaned forward, resting her forehead against his, feeling the warmth of his thoughts wrap around her like a promise. Together, they would face the fearsome mountain ahead, navigating uncharted territory hand in hand. Clara knew that the road would be challenging, but in this moment, she realized that the bond they shared was irreplaceable—stronger, perhaps, than it had ever been. They would find a new way to define love, to redefine life—and she would not let go.",2,1731242363.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

I’ve heard horror stories about moving in with a significant other’s parents, but nothing quite like this. Here’s the setup:

In the house, it was me (Tim, 30M), my girlfriend (Erica, 30F), her mom (Jane, 60F), her stepdad (Pete, 71M), her son (Matt, 13M), plus a cat and a dog. All names have been changed to preserve anonymity. My state has grandparental rights, and Matt had chosen to live with his grandmother.

Jane offered for us to stay with her instead of renting an apartment, saying she needed help around the house and with Pete, who’s a double amputee and essentially immobile. He lives on a gurney in the living room and has incredibly sharp hearing, so he constantly makes requests if he hears anyone near. This created a tense atmosphere—especially since he and Jane argued almost every morning from different floors, usually over him accusing her of misplacing things and her firing back that’s he forgot where he put it. Later on it was revealed she was giving his stuff away and sometimes just throwing it away. 

We’d get dressed to the soundtrack of their bickering, and while I offered to mediate for Matt’s sake, Erica told me to stay out of it. Then things started getting weird. One morning, after their daily argument, Jane knocked on our door. Erica said, “Wait a minute, we’re naked,” and Jane replied, “Let me see.” We laughed, thinking it was a joke, but later that morning, over coffee, Jane said she “wasn’t joking” and “wanted to see us naked.” We were stunned and just didn’t respond.

In hindsight, I probably should have left right then, but I was trying to help the family. A few days later, I got out of the shower wrapped in a towel. As I was heading to my room, Jane quickly  creeped out from a nearby door, blocking my way, looking me up and down, and commenting on my body. I awkwardly thanked her, told her I was uncomfortable, and she let me pass.

Later that night, Jane texted me, asking me to come to her room. Reluctantly, I went, and she asked if I remembered anything from the previous night. I told her I’d just gone to bed. Jane claimed she’d come into my room by mistake, thinking it was her room. She made a comment that I was “lucky she didn’t take advantage of me.” I told her this was inappropriate and then talked to Erica, who thought her mom was just being “a free spirit” and meant no harm, though she promised to ask Jane to stop.

But Jane didn’t stop. One afternoon, I was playing Xbox with Matt, hoping to avoid any alone time with Jane. She walked up, kissed me on the cheek, and started rubbing my shoulders. I asked her to stop, while Matt just kept playing, and Erica stood there, visibly uncomfortable.

The next day, Jane ignored me, and when I tried to greet her, she glared at me. Later, Matt called a family meeting, saying Jane didn’t feel appreciated. During the meeting, Jane pointed at me and accused me of not saying hello in “her own house.” Confused, I explained I had greeted her but have a soft voice, so maybe she didn’t hear. Matt immediately jumped in, scolding her for yelling at me.

At this point, the conversation started escalating, so I excused myself. Jane then cursed at Erica and demanded she leave, but asked me to stay. This shocked me because Erica had been doing all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry for everyone, while I’d been removed from Pete’s care due to costs. I told Jane there was no way I’d stay without Erica, and we left, grabbing what we could.

Jane later texted saying we couldn’t come back for the rest of our belongings. Erica called the cops, who explained our tenant rights. We stayed in a hotel to let things settle, but when we returned to get our things, Jane called the cops on us again.

1gnzqqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1gnzqqt/monthly_cost_of_living_in_bangkok_for_a_couple/,Monthly Cost of Living in Bangkok for a Couple,"This post was originally published on **[Substack](https://nomadicadventures.substack.com/p/monthly-cost-of-living-in-bangkok)**. That has a better reading experience and also includes some images. But all the text is included below so you can read here if you prefer.

Before I get into how much we spend in Bangkok in a typical month, there are a few things you need to note. Firstly, everyone’s cost of living is different. We know couples that spend much less than us and couples that spend substantially more.

We live in the Phrom Phong area. This is very central, so most things will be more expensive. I’ll write a separate post comparing the main districts of Bangkok where the vast majority of foreigners live.

Our lifestyle is unique to us. Yours will probably be different.

Our current costs are based on us living here for a minimum of six months at a time. We usually spend six months in Bangkok and six months traveling. We didn’t go traveling last year due to a death in the family, so our current stay is 18 months. We’ll be traveling again from February next year.

**Accommodation**

This is a big expense for most people. Fortunately, Bangkok has a very wide range of condo prices. If you live far out of the center, you can still find condos for around 5,000 baht ($146) a month.

You can also find very high-end condos for 250,000 baht ($7,300) a month.

We pay 35,000 baht ($1,022) a month for a 54 sqm condo in the heart of Phrom Phong. Even in our building, it’s possible to get a slightly smaller condo for around 25,000 baht, but we wanted to be at the corner of the building, as the views are pretty awesome. We also prefer a slightly large condo.

We have had a series of 6-month leases. Most condos in our building are only available for 6 or 12-month leases.

If you’re only planning to stay a month or so, expect to pay more.

We usually use Airbnb to find places to stay when traveling, but in Bangkok, we usually try to find a place that we can rent directly from the owner.

**Monthly Utility Bills**

Our utility bills are pretty reasonable, and are as follows:

Electricity is usually around 2,500-3,000 baht ($73-78)

Water is usually 100-120 baht ($3-4)

Internet is 660 baht ($19) - the internet speed is around 150 Mbps via wifi and 300 Mbps if using an ethernet cable

Mobile phone charges are around 1,200 baht ($35) for both of us

**Eating Out and In**

This can vary a lot from day to day. Some days we’ll head to one of the local food courts for lunch and spend 90 baht each ($3 each). On other days we’ll head to a restaurant and pay around 600 baht ($18) between us.

We probably average around 400 baht a day for lunch, so that’s 12,000 baht ($350) in a month.

We usually have dinner at home but do sometimes get takeaway, like today. We just spent 500 baht for this evening’s dinner.

Over the month, we probably spend another 12,000 baht ($350) on dinner.

**Coffee**

This has a category of its own because we visit cafes every day. Phrom Phong is a more expensive area for cafes, and we usually spend 300-500 baht a day. Like lunch, this works out at around 12,000 baht ($350) a month.

Many think this is an insane amount to spend on coffee every month, and maybe it is. I didn’t spend most of my life working just to end up sitting at home drinking coffee just to save some money.

**General Shopping**

Some of this is included in the eating section above. Other than that, we probably spend an extra 3,500 baht ($100) on general shopping.

**Travel**

We don’t travel outside of Bangkok much while we’re here. We probably spend an average of 3,500 baht ($100) a month on this.

For public transport, we usually use the BTS or motorbike taxis. Our monthly spend is around 2,000 baht ($58) a month.

**Entertainment**

We’re not party people, so we don’t spend much at all on this. Usually, we’d meet up with friends at a café or restaurant, and those costs are included above.

**Total Expenditure**

The above gives a total expenditure of 84,980 baht ($2,500).

**Wait, there’s more**

When I look at the figure above, I wish our spending was this low. However, we have spent a lot more recently. There are usually plenty of extras that never get mentioned in cost of living reports. They’re not usually regular expenses, but you still need to plan for them.

Passport - I need to renew one of my passports this month and that will cost around 5,000 baht ($150).

Visa - I need to renew my permission to stay in the country this month as well. That costs 1,900 baht. I also need a re-entry permit (1,000 baht). Then there’s the cost of getting to and from the immigration office and having photos taken. This year, I also need to go back a second time to get the visa and re-entry permit transferred to my new passport. Total cost will be around 5,000 baht ($150).

Personal training and therapy - I have had a personal trainer and therapist for the last six months and that has cost around 10,000 baht ($300) a month.

Dentist - I needed dental treatment a few months ago, as did my wife.

Clothes & Luggage - we buy new clothes fairly regularly and also need some new luggage before we travel again in February.

Weddings - we have two weddings to attend in the next two months. The one outside Bangkok will mean staying at a hotel for a few nights. It will also involve buying some new clothes.

Electronics - I haven’t bought any in recent years, but my wife needs a new phone soon and I’m considering buying a new laptop. The one I’m interested in is 65,000 baht ($1,900). I’m not sure I can justify paying that much, so we'll have to see if I decide to buy it or not. My current laptop is around 7 years old. Maybe I’ll keep it for a bit longer.

There are plenty of other expenses that can crop up. They will be different for everyone. So, when someone tells you that you can live in Bangkok for $3,000 a month or whatever, don’t forget to factor in all the additional expenses that rarely get mentioned.

Make sure you have an emergency fund. I’ve seen so many people come unstuck over the years because of expenses they didn’t plan for.

I hope this is of some help to those planning to stay in Bangkok. If you’ve already stayed here, let me know what your monthly expenses were.",7,1731242238.0,digitalnomad,7,0.77,False

But Jane didn’t stop. One afternoon, I was playing Xbox with Matt, hoping to avoid any alone time with Jane. She walked up, kissed me on the cheek, and started rubbing my shoulders. I asked her to stop, while Matt just kept playing, and Erica stood there, visibly uncomfortable.

The next day, Jane ignored me, and when I tried to greet her, she glared at me. Later, Matt called a family meeting, saying Jane didn’t feel appreciated. During the meeting, Jane pointed at me and accused me of not saying hello in “her own house.” Confused, I explained I had greeted her but have a soft voice, so maybe she didn’t hear. Matt immediately jumped in, scolding her for yelling at me.

At this point, the conversation started escalating, so I excused myself. Jane then cursed at Erica and demanded she leave, but asked me to stay. This shocked me because Erica had been doing all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry for everyone, while I’d been removed from Pete’s care due to costs. I told Jane there was no way I’d stay without Erica, and we left, grabbing what we could.

Jane later texted saying we couldn’t come back for the rest of our belongings. Erica called the cops, who explained our tenant rights. We stayed in a hotel to let things settle, but when we returned to get our things, Jane called the cops on us again.

I’m at a complete loss here. Any advice? Has anyone been through anything remotely similar?",1,1731241541.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1gnzjlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gnzjlr/ellie/,Ellie,"Ellie’s mother was killed in a car crash when Ellie was fourteen. They had been on their way to IKEA.

Ellie never went to an IKEA for years after that, as she had no reason to, until she was an adult, setting up her own place, and she simply had to visit one.

And so, on a sunny fall Saturday afternoon, she drove to the local IKEA, and entered, feeling that usual combination of joy, excitement and wonder that accompanies the start of any IKEA visit. She didn’t think much about her mother anymore, what with the passage of time and all that.

The IKEA store was crowded, as expected. Ellie followed the arrows, trying to focus on what she needed and not be distracted by the hundreds of pretty objects artfully placed around the milling human bodies. The bedroom décor was exactly what she would have wanted. She stood wistfully in the fake room, fingering the soft colourful throw on the bedroom. People moved by her, and the hum of the crowd blanketed her mind.

“You should definitely get that” said a woman pleasantly in her ear.

Ellie turned- irrationally expecting to see her mother, one of those cruel tricks of the heart of those of us who are grieving.  

It wasn’t her mother. Just another woman. Ellie smiled. “It’s gorgeous isn’t it.”

“I love it” said the woman emphatically. “I want to feel it all the time. Forever”

At that moment Ellie realised there was something wrong with the woman- her face- her features not quite where they should be, the pinpoints of fire in her otherwise blank eyes. Slowly, she let go of the throw, and began merging back in the crowd. The woman didn’t notice, too focused on trying to touch the fabric.

Ellie let the crowd sweep her to the kitchen displays. She stepped up to a stove, where a woman was staring at a large, impossibly bright gleaming pot. Ellie looked at the reflection of their faces, curved and deformed, in the pot side. This must be her mother, she looked like the woman in the photos Ellie had at home.

The woman turned to Ellie, her mis-adjusted face full of wanting, her eyes flaming with the desire to have. “You should get this pot- It is so beautiful, and the handles are heat resistant.” She moved her ghostly hands which seemed to have the wrong number of fingers, or fingers positioned wrongly, around the black handles. “Look Ellie- this will last forever. Forever.”

Ellie stifled a sob, and stumbled out of the kitchen.

But, she wasn’t ready to leave yet. She knew, knew with desperate certainty that her mother must be here, admiring something, and she had to find her.

She was in the living room displays. Among the slow humming flow of humans, there were women looking yearningly at couches and coffee tables, standing too still, the positioning of their bodies wrong.

Ellie knew one of them had to be her mother.",15,1731241541.0,shortscarystories,1,0.95,False

I've experienced loss on so many occasions I'm conditioned to this life (not a good thing) but I've learned that kindness (only if it's genuine) is a real treat in this world.

So there's this woman who lives out her vehicle as well. I see here around but she doesn't really go far from her comfortable radius. I go to the gym (workout, shower) so I decided to get some breakfast before I start my session. I see her vehicle and ive been wondering if she been doing well. It's getting cold now so I'm a little concerned about the people that are in the same situation as myself. Something in me told me to get her some food and coffee also, so that's what I did.

From a good distance (I don't want to approach her vehicle and startle her) I motion that I have some hot food and a coffee for her. She waves me off and motions that she didn't want it. That's fine and all, no hard feelings, but when the weather gets like this and there's a person that wants me to stay warm and fed, I can only thank God for that person.

I hope she's doing well though.",6,1731240988.0,homeless,3,0.8,False

Tested on 26/10

I’ve taken so much from this sub and I prolly can’t Thankyou guys enough, but here are my 2 cents. 

I won’t dig deep into the usual methods of studying since you guys prolly know all that, but may ask away in the comments.

A little background
My prep began in 2021, i started off with first aid and bnb and pathoma. I studied on and off, quit a few times, but this last sprint took me 7 months of consistency and tg I killed it. I was a very average student, I couldn’t sit still I had to go out everyday, but the last 7 months it was a now or never situation for me and that derived me to focus. I’d say being consistent and sitting still was the hardest part for me. 

Study methods: 
Apart from the generic FA and UW, the most important resource is MEHLMAN!!!!! I can’t emphasize enough of how important those free pdfs are. ALL OF MEHLMAN IS HY.
I’d annotate uw in first aid, I went thru that book a few times. But towards the end it became a burden and that’s when I reviews systems from MEHLMAN, I wish I started sooner. If I were to suggest the 3 best pdfs, I’d go with 
HY Arrows (do it atleast twice)
HY Neurology (very volatile for me)
HY endocrine (saved my ass cause my exam was heavy on endo and repro)

Things I didnt relate to from this sub:
-The pretty obvious, people scoring 70s and 80s in their nbmes and being a wuss abt it, the am I ready posts 
- getting too frantic about biochem and biostats, my exam wasn’t too heavy on those
- they say that you’re drained out by the 5th block and the last 2 blocks are a nightmare, it’s not. I had my energy thru out, although my eyes were pretty strained cause of the constant focus, but I wasn’t burnt out and unable to think 

NBMES: 
My nbmes were scattered 

25-38%
27-42%
26-46%
28-53%
24-60%
30-54%
29-60%
22-64%
Old free 120-66%
Nbme 21- 61%
Nbme 31-63% (7 days out)
New free 120-67% (2 days out

I would insist on doing all nbmes 20-31 in proper exam conditions, timed and all. It helped me build a stamina and my focus. And the explanations, both correct and incorrect I did them thoroughly. In the last 3 weeks my main focus was nbme explanations and MEHLMAN pds and I think they were the biggest help. 

Exam day: 
I usually am a calm person but I slept for 6ish hours the night of. The fear took the better of me. When I woke up I had coffee and eggs. Took coffee and protein bars along. I only had a few sips of coffee between my breaks. I was pretty calm and confident during the exam. I maked 17 questions per block on average and 2 blocks I marked 22ish, they were my bad blocks. The questions I wasn’t getting I told myself they’re experimental and it helped me keep my shit together. 
The exam is doable, it requires confidence, stay calm, pray, and you’ll be fine inshallah. Give it your best shot, don’t leave any stone unturned. We got this. Good luck!!",21,1731240691.0,step1,5,1.0,False
