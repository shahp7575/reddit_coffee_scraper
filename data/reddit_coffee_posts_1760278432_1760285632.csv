**Overture:**

First of all, aren’t we going to say anything about Disney’s greed and Joachim Rønning smiling to our faces while stabbing us in the back? They scammed us — straight up — from the marketing to the interviews, all the way to the final frame of the movie.

*-Chaos, good news.*

**Fall:**

The Disney opening sequence, the news-style intro like in Legacy, Flynn’s voiceover, the coffee shop scene, the Dumont containers, the Ducatis, the return to the OG Grid — all of it was just a teaspoon of nostalgia to sweeten the bait. A finger’s worth of honey to shut us up. They knew what we wanted, and they fuckin abused it for profit.

There’s no Tron in the damn movie — how much worse even can it get? Apparently Sam Flynn left Encom and now two random girls are running the company. Yeah right, fuck that. Just throw Legacy and The Next Day in the trash and make this shitty-ass movie instead. So referencing the old films makes this movie a good Tron Movie? Absolutely fuckn not!

*-You*'*re messing with my Zen* thing man.

**Adagio for Tron:**

What the fuck did this so-called Ares add to the story from the OG Tron and Tron: Legacy?

How the hell do you spend this much money and still not include Bruce Boxleitner along with Jeff Bridges cameo? What kind of Tron movie is this, THERE’S NO TRON FOR FUCK’S SAKE!

And now they’re saying Tron’s story has always been weak — for two whole films, really? Fuck that. THERE’S A THING CALLED LORE, DAMN IT, AND THIS MOVIE HAS NONE OF THE TRON LORE.

*-Tron, he fought for me...*

**Recognizer-Disc Wars-Solar Sailer:**

We’ve seen it in both the OG Encom system and Legacy — Recognizers fly fast. That’s just how it is. But in this movie? It took the damn thing 30 minutes to get to the city. Are you kidding me?And if you're gonna say, “Well actually, this is the Dillinger system, it's different”— I say: get the fuck outta here with that bullshit. From a hangar the size of a damn ass, a massive Recognizer comes out — and nobody’s gonna say shit about that, huh? 

The disc‑battle scene was full of shitty, clumsy moves — like, what the hell? Your friend’s leg gets ripped off, I jump in to help, than a bomb, boom — you’re all dead, wow. Since when is Dillinger’s squad somehow superior to Encom’s security programs? When you are master control is this makes you the most powerful program in *Encom's Grid* tf?

CLU was fed by Flynn, TRON was literally brought from the OG system by Flynn himself — where’s your explanation for that? According to what logic does that suddenly master control in Dillinger's Grid becomes op in Encom's grid? Is it just whatever the hell you feel like? Pick a piece of lore when it suits you and ignore the rest — fuck off.

By the way Encom Recognizer was blue and Solar Sailer's turned yellow, I can handle those.

*-This will take us, there.*

**Flynn Lives:**

Jeff Bridges’ cameo might be the only scene I actually liked in the whole damn movie. From a lore perspective, the entire film is only worth watching for that Flynn scene — that’s all I have to say. But why the hell was Flynn’s likeness inside the OG Encom? We didn’t get that at all, fuck. CLU was a Codified Likeness Utility — he didn’t age in Legacy, so what gives? THE LORE HAS RULES, DAMN IT! And don’t give me that “the actor’s old, what can we do” crap. No, you can’t just mess around with lore whenever you feel like it.

By the way, they totally fucked up the Flynn Lives movement that popped up in The Next Day. Just slap 2-3 posters on some walls and suddenly that’s the whole Flynn Lives movement? Yeah right. Sam’s behind all this, RAM, TRON — none of that matters. I shatter lore however the fuck I want, got a problem with that? Yeah, I don’t give a shit. Signed by, Disney.

 *-Been living in a hall of mirrors. The ISOs shattered it...*

**Derezzed:**

I want to ask you—what stuck with you from this shitty movie? They busted their asses not to say “Derezzed” the whole damn movie. When programs die, they say “deleted” in the dialogue or whatever. To hell with your lore — they basically said “they’re dead.” Didn’t you get it? They completely messed with the entire fandom, damn, what a disgrace.

*-If you lose your disc, or fail to follow commands, you will be subject to immediate deresolution.*

**Rectifier:**

The only positive thing I see about the film is that, for the first time since 2010, it gives fans like us a chance to collect some actual collector’s items. From what I’ve seen, Hasbro is going to release a bunch of toys — figures, lightcycles, discs, everything. I’ll definitely try to collect them all, though I’m not sure if they’ll even make it to the European continent.

*-What am i supposed to do?*

**End of Line:**

There are probably a lot of things I’ve forgotten — it’s been just a day since I watched the movie — but these are the things that pissed me off the most. If anyone wants to comment, I’d genuinely love to discuss this further. But you know… it wasn’t supposed to be like this. Thanks for reading. Maybe we were wrong for waiting and wanting a new film in the first place. Like Flynn said:

\-The thing about perfection is that it’s unknowable. It’s impossible, but it’s also right in front of you all the time...

So, I’m a bit of an enigma—I’m a hopeless romantic who yearns for quiet romance, just sharing our lives, making memories, or alternatively laughing so hard tears will flow. Alas, as tragicomic as it sounds, I’m also asexual. Which means I’m not up for anything sexual, ever. This, to no surprise, has made my dating journey a bit challenging. Maybe we’ll change that? I offer you lame jokes, dry humour, teasing as a love language and loads of cuddles. Needless to say I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and can live without any carnal activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll strike it lucky and you’re asexual too! Also, casual dating is not something I do, so I'm not looking for anything short term.

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some!

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, feminist, you get it)
* chubby and short (160cm), short dark brown hair (but it changes, it’s been green, blue, purple…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve or two
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* don’t want children
* city girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into photography, writing, reading, fashion, k-pop, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not athletic or outdoorsy lol
* sadly allergic to pets :(

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age, give or take a few years
* located somewhere in Europe
* doesn't want children
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous
* someone I can have both deep conversations and fun with

**Dealbreakers/ Big NOs for me:**

* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* *severe* mental health problems (no ill meaning, I’m just a sensitive person who often carries others’ troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)

I’m thinking of doing a solo trip to the Lake District this January, somewhere between the 11th and 25th (dates still a bit flexible). I’m planning to stay for about 7–10 days, depending on how things shape up.

This’ll be my first time in the Lakes, so I’d love some help planning it out. The main goal is to just slow down, spend time in nature, take it easy, take photos, and soak in the winter vibes. I’m into short hikes, mountain views, moody weather (fog, mist, and snow are a big win for me), and I’m really looking forward to making my own coffee in the outdoors with a view. If it snows, that’s just icing on the cake.

I’m not into pubs or restaurants — I’d rather avoid busy towns and spend more time in quiet, natural spots. Not looking to rush around and tick off loads of places either. I’m totally happy exploring just 2–3 beautiful areas and really enjoying them.

In terms of hiking, I’m reasonably fit but nothing extreme. I did the Old Man of Storr and the Quiraing walk last April and felt fine, but I know winter hikes can be tougher, so I want to stick to safer, well-known trails.

I’ll be travelling up from London and relying on trains/buses/bikes the whole way. I can drive in my home country, but I’m not confident about driving here in the UK (don't have a driving license, and don't know the traffic rules), so I’ll be avoiding renting a car.

For places to stay, I’m not into fancy hotels — I’d actually love to find a cozy cabin or glamping spot with WiFi, since I might have to do a few days of remote work while I’m there.

Would really appreciate any tips on where to base myself, possible itineraries, public transport stuff, or cool places to stay that are peaceful and surrounded by nature.

I started feeling like crap on Monday 10/6 and I woke up Tuesday 10/7 completely sick.  Felt like hell.  I was already planning on doing another fast, and I wanted to see how fasting works while sick, so I just rolled with it.  

Tuesday 10/7 I spent the entire day in bed.  Just water and Tylenol, couldn’t even make myself some coffee.  

Wednesday 10/8 wasn’t much better.  All day in bed.  Water and Tylenol only.   Thursday 10/9 I was able to make myself some coffee, went to the store and got myself some ginger tea and lemons.  I forced myself to go to work. (I didn’t want to go, but I work in an industry where calling in sick can cost you hours for the next week, after you recover, the boss might punish you by docking hours from your schedule)

I worked Thursday 10/9 and Friday 10/10, both days were terrible and I only survived because of ginger tea, lemon juice, vitamin c and multi vitamin)

By Saturday 10/11 I felt a lot better, was still feeling run down but I knew I could get through the entire work day no problem. 

Today, Sunday 10/12,  I feel mostly back to normal,  a little bit of congestion and muscle stiffness, but frankly I feel like I’m back at 90%.  I’m at 5 days and 6 hours fasted right now.  Having coffee and feel great. 

I’m glad I tried this, I think it’s a great way to reduce time and severity of a sickness.  If I hadn’t been forced to go to work the last 3 days, I might have gotten better ever quicker.

I have quite a few codes, and definitely won’t utilize them all. 

If you’ve already received from me in the prior two giveaways, please let some new folks get blessed. Trying to reach as many folks as possible vs giving to the same few folks. Thanks!

*Manners go a long way, a simple please & thank you are appreciated! I’ve seen a lot of entitlement on my previous postings, which made me discouraged to help again.





STEPS TO CLAIM:
1. Comment that you’re interested. Just say “I’m interested” — not “I’m interested in fries” or “nuggets” or anything specific. It’s important that your comment is a new top-level comment, not a reply to someone else’s. That helps me see everyone in order since Reddit sometimes clumps replies together.
2. Unsolicited DMs will be ignored. I’ll DM people in the order they commented. Please wait for me to reach out when it’s your turn.
3. When I reply to your comment with a number, that means I’ve seen it and that’s your place in line. (So if I comment “#5,” you’re the fifth person I’ll message.)
	⁠•	⁠Even if your number is higher than the amount of offers I have, don’t panic — sometimes people don’t respond, can’t coordinate, or change their minds. So if there are 10 offers and you’re #13, there’s still a chance. Just be patient and hang tight.
4.	⁠Once I DM you, you’ll have about 15 minutes to respond and coordinate your pickup. If I don’t hear back, I’ll move to the next person.
5.	⁠When it’s your turn, I’ll ask for:
	⁠•	⁠the zip code of the McDonald’s you’ll be picking up from
	⁠•	⁠whether you’re using drive-thru or counter pickup
	⁠•	⁠and I’ll tell you what’s still available at that point (you can’t claim items early — what’s left changes constantly).
6.	⁠After I place your order, I’ll send a screenshot with the code to show at the drive-thru or counter.
7.	⁠Please reply to your original comment once you’ve picked up your food so others know it’s legit.

For places to stay, I’m not into fancy hotels — I’d actually love to find a cozy cabin or glamping spot with WiFi, since I might have to do a few days of remote work while I’m there.

Would really appreciate any tips on where to base myself, possible itineraries, public transport stuff, or cool places to stay that are peaceful and surrounded by nature.

Thanks in advance!",1,1760284895.0,UKhiking,0,1.0,False
1o4stjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1o4stjy/parents_letting_kids_get_away_with_things_cus/,Parents letting kids get away with things cus they’re “cute”,"I spent the weekend with my husband’s family inclusive of his baby niece and 6 year old nephew, and I’m going to sound super mean saying this but I cannot stand being around his nephew. 

I had such a horrible time having to pretend that he’s the cutest little boy in the whole world but I simply cannot stand being around him and having to entertain his antics. I’m not going to say that I hate the child himself because let’s be real here, it’s not his fault. He’s my parents-in-law’s first grandchild so you can imagine he gets doted on like crazy, and a lot of his behaviour goes unchecked. And everyone just gives him everything no matter how stupid the request is!!!!

Let me just list some things that happened that pissed me of:

1.) He was screaming and demanded for ice cream and wanted the tiramisu flavoured ice cream. Of course he got the flavour he wanted but the moment he took his first scoop he started gagging and spitting it out. His mom complained that my mom-in-law shouldn’t have gotten him tiramisu as it has coffee. Mind you, the boy’s mom and my mom in law were BOTH present during the buying process so like i don’t know why my sister in law was so mad at my mom in law??? Anyways they passed that damn tiramisu ice cream currently filled with the boy’s spit up TO ME AND MY HUSBAND to finish. We didn’t of course. 

2.) The boy asked to eat aglio olio and wanted nothing else. Parents relented (SIGH I know) and when he got it, what happened with tiramisu ice cream happened with the pasta. Boy gagged and spit it out, started crying as it was too spicy. Parents blamed the restaurant because “aglio olio pastas aren’t usually so spicy!!” bro come on, there’s always chilli flakes in aglio olios.

3.) I had ordered fries for the family to share during the meal, one was cheese fries and the other was truffle fries. Because the boy couldn’t eat the gosh damn aglio olio, his parents told him to eat the cheese fries and the boy of course started gobbling it down, both dirty hands just getting all in there. It was so gross, the boy was sucking on his fingers, coughing and sneezing into the fries. The parents didn’t do shit. Whenever me or anyone else tried to pick up a fry with our fork, the boy would snatch the fry from our fork for himself. Safe to say none of us got more than 1 fry each. And the truffle fries became cheese fries too cus the boy was just mixing his saliva and cheese juices on his fingers into the truffle fries pile.

4.) I know he’s just a kid and it’s probably a harmless act to him but he likes to grab our boobs and punch/smack them randomly??? His mom wouldn’t make an effort to stop him and worse still everyone else would just laugh and be like “omg he’s so cute and funny!!”. He tried it multiple times with me during our weekend trip no matter how many times my husband and I stopped him. Everyone else found it cute so no intervention there. 

5.) in the middle of my conversation with my sister in law and mother in law, he screamed and told us that “all this talking is disturbing my ears please shut up!!!!” and again, I found it unfunny, rude and annoying but everyone laughed and found it super cute and adorable!!!! We continued talking and he proceeds to smack his mom on the mouth for that. I called his name angrily, but his mom told me to lay off of him. Like wtf is wrong with you, this behaviour is NOT okay? 

6.) He also gets really physically rough with his baby sister who is only a year old. Smacks her in the head, pinches her cheeks till she cries and all that. And again, everyone finds it super cute and a “bonding” moment but I just see the opposite. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, just needed to rant to be honest. But nothing angers me more than bad behaviour going unchecked because parents are too blinded by their child’s “cuteness”. Of course the child doesn’t know any better but holy shit, I dread spending time with him cus I know for a fact that my requests to “stop” or any complaints to his parents would fall of deaf ears. 

And yeah, I’ve had NEVER wanted children, but man, seeing how this nephew is being raised has made me QUADRUPLE CONFIRM my decision to be a lifelong childless couple w my husband 😬",2,1760284828.0,childfree,3,1.0,False

Used to get a bonus, used to see a raise,
Now it’s “Thanks for your service” and 60-hour days.
They cut the profit share, said “times are tight,”
But the shareholders’ checks still lookin’ right.

We’re runnin’ three desks with one worn chair,
They call it “streamlined,” we call it unfair.
“Take the lump sum, it’s the smarter plan,”
Yeah, for the execs, not the working man.

(Chorus)
There’s a ghost at the top, but we know his name,
He never shows face, still runs the game.
Says “culture matters,” but not our pay,
He’s buildin’ his empire while ours decays.

Emails talkin’ “purpose” and “vision shared,”
Meanwhile claims are backlogged, nobody’s spared.
“Fifteen minutes could save,” they say,
But fifteen years couldn’t fix this place.

(Verse 2)
Supervisors smile like “change is good,”
Then announce more cuts than anyone should.
Coffee’s weak, morale’s on E,
And the Gecko looks like he’s tryna flee.

We’re payin’ out claims just to clear the queue,
Because there’s half the staff that we once knew.
The phones don’t stop and the system lags,
But they brag about “efficiency” tags.

(Bridge)
Oh, the shareholders cheer with a glass of wine,
While we chase targets we’ll never find.
The “family” talk’s gettin’ kinda old,
You can’t hug folks when your heart’s this cold.

(Final Chorus)
There’s a ghost at the top, but we feel his hand,
Cut our hours, our pay, our stand.
He don’t need meetings, don’t need grace,
Just a profit chart and a poker face.

If this ship sinks, it won’t be slow,
It’s already leakin’, we all know.
Still we clock in, do what we do,
Because the Gecko can’t drive this car without you.

(Outro, spoken)
“Thank you for calling.
All agents are currently covering three departments.
Please hold… forever.”

What bothered me, though, was what happened afterward. As she was leaving, she said, “I will not kiss you, to make it clear.” I didn’t know what to say at that moment. Based on our previous conversations, I wouldn’t have tried to kiss her unless I thought she was comfortable, so that comment really threw me off.

I've never made a romantic advance on a woman simply because I believe its wrong for a man to do that to any women whom he has not been with for a long time. The first time I tried I was immediately rejected so I don't say much to women I like anymore, or try and interact with them, or even look at them, unless they look at or talk to me first in semi social settings like bars and coffee shops or even school. I just feel most people think its even ok to go for a kiss with a girl unless she leans in first but I find even that can be a mistake. I don't ask for a date unless they start speaking to me in depth first and I don't even mention a date until after the second time we've met. Some may say I'm being too careful but at least then Im not an awful man and just a bit weird. I just try to remain like a half alive mannequin and just follow the womens lead which also hasn't work but at least it doesn't end awfully. Overall I just avoid women fraternization wise who show no interest in engaging with me which is almost 100%. It doesn't help that I'm an alcoholic because of chronic pain and studying from home. I just feel its better to be scared of women than be friends with them because what if I fall for one and then they hate me because I say one day “I have something to tell you”. I'd rather take the math out completely and don't even give myself the option to fall for anyone ever as it can happen at any time and ruin even the best of friendships. Women I feel are more allowed to express their romanticism and sexuality, I saw public reviews of morning glory milking farm… yet If I did the same for my favourite porn site I would be called an objectifier and a misogynist.

I really enjoyed this one!🙏❤️ Don't bully in the workplace, or you may find yourself...","Bleeding from the head, wrists bound to a splintered chair, and Bluey reruns crackling on an ancient VCR. Not exactly how I’d imagined turning twenty-three.

Blinking crusted scarlet red from my eyes, I fought to stay awake, a thick, hollow drowsiness swamping my thoughts. The pain was enough to snap me out of it, a dull pulsing across the back of my skull. 

I’d been hit over the head. I could still feel the impact, my nose was swollen from falling face-first. But it wasn’t just that. 

The pain wasn't just from the blow. There was something else, something my foggy brain couldn’t or didn’t want to register. 

The taste of blood and metal clung to my tongue. I tried to move, tried to throw my head back, and something warm slid down my temple, trickling down the curve of my neck. Bluey? I thought dizzily. 

That was a kids’ show, right? The screen was fuzzy. 

A modern cartoon playing in an old aspect ratio was enough to drag the last splinters of me wanting to sleep back to reality. I straightened in the chair, mentally checking myself over. 

All limbs intact, but bound. 

Looking down, I saw my ankles tied to the chair legs, my wrists strapped to the arms. 

Something snapped inside me, fight or flight kicking in, my breaths shuddery, thick, and heavy. 

I tried to scream, but my lips wouldn’t part. Something thick and sticky glued them shut. Hysteria crawled up my throat, but I forced myself to focus on the flickering TV screen, on anything but drawing attention to myself. Bluey. Modern colors barely bled through the old grain, swimming into fuzz. The TV was struggling. Leaning forward, I tried to watch it, but the cartoon was on mute. 

Every so often the screen would go black, the TV giving out, before restarting. My little cousin used to watch it. 

But why Bluey?

Movement beside me, and I realized I wasn’t alone. 

A figure was strapped to a chair, half-lidded eyes unblinking, watching the screen. 

The strip of duct tape over his mouth trembled, as if he were trying to speak. 

Recognition came slowly. Painfully. As if my mind were trying to swallow him. 

Popped collar, tie, lanyard. 

Thick, bloodstained blonde curls fell over half-lidded eyes that were far too vacant, too empty. 

His gaze was fixed on the TV, his head inclined in a way that made him look almost like a child. 

The TV flashed, bathing his face in pale blue light, illuminating the coin-sized hole drilled into the back of his skull. Bile slid up my throat, my stomach twisting. His name caught in my gag when footsteps sounded behind me. A figure loomed, and something swirled in the air. I blinked. Steam?

“Do you want some coffee, *dude*?”

The voice was unmistakable. 

I didn’t see the cup, but when I lifted my head, I saw the wave of burned brown liquid splash onto my colleague’s head. Scalding hot coffee erupted in a horrifying hiss of steam. 

I screamed, my body jerking, heart in my throat. But my colleague didn’t even blink as coffee met blood, seeping down his temple. His body sat slumped, head cocked, eyes glued to the TV.",2,1760284245.0,u_Trash_Tia,0,1.0,False

There’s more to it..

I (37F) live with my unmarried partner (39M). We have two kids together. I take care of the household, am default parent, fund both kids through school and extracurricular. I even buy his damn coffees and smoothies that I treat myself to every day. He drives my car, the list goes on. 

We fight a lot. Mainly over finances and responsibilities. I’m so burnt out as breadwinner (he doesn’t work and I have hired childcare help for our youngest), as primary caretaker and house cleaner. I know the clear answer is to separate but I do not trust my kids under his care if we were to get 50/50 which he would fight for. In my state after 7 years they treat it basically the same as being married. We have shared mortgage. He has his kids from
 Previous marriage in their rooms here basically all day, just gets them fast food (has never cooked a meal for them), basically fulfills their basic needs although one time he let them go a whole month without showering. I know he’d do the same with mine which is why I cannot consider divorce for their sake. If you’re wondering will he even fight for 50/50, he absolutely will. All thanks to the funding from his parents who funded his previous divorce, almost 600k total in attorney fees, and now they live with us full time. He was able to find some magic evidence against the ex mentally and use it against her when she wanted to move out of state. He got his ways… He says he will do the same with me. 

To add to it, i have asked my partner to do ONE project since May. It’s installing those acoustic wooden slats on our wall, not even an entire wall probably just 8 feet across. I purchased all the materials, did all the measuring. All I need is him to remove our old mantel and put the slats up. can I do it? Yes, do I want to? No. Initially the ask was to do it within 90 days so that we can return it if we didn’t like them. Welp, 90 days has passed and we are now in October. I even brought the panels inside the house so he can see them everyday. He promises to get to it each weekend and each weekend ticks by. Obviously this is only one out of many issues. 

I feel I don’t ask for much at all!! He jokes when we’re out in public or meeting new people after we do intros that he is living the life, the retired life. Because I have a well paying job. Since he doesn’t work, he truly gets to do whatever he wants. He is so enabled by his mom and I’m sure I don’t help.

My manager (F and somewhere in her 20s-30s) is in charge of my schedule and has changed it last minute at least 2 times in the past 2 weeks. I'm also a college student trying to balance school and work at the moment. For some back story this location opened up like a week ago, so I don't know if I'm being a little dramatic or not. 

When I first interviewed for this job a few months ago (our opening was delayed) I was told that schedules come out about 2 weeks in advance. This was also mentioned at our orientation that was held. I am the kind of person that likes to plan their schedule in advance based on my work schedule, especially since I'm a computer science major and it's midterm time. My first schedule came out in probably the end of September and it was the schedule for my training as well as the first week we opened. And then a week after I got my schedule for the week after (this upcoming week). To add onto this, I have also yet to receive my schedule for next week even though that is very much 7 days away.

My last job was a small family owned business that was under the table and I don't really know how to go about this. When my original schedule came out I was scheduled to work a morning shift when I  was unavailable and I got someone to cover it for me. I expressed this on our work chat that is dedicated for offering shifts. There are like 60 employees at my location, so there are plenty of people to work. . Then a week later the schedule was changed and I was once again put on for working on that same Sunday that I already had covered. I thought whatever it is a one time thing and our stand had just opened, so I'll just deal with it. Then this Friday I got a new notification that my schedule was changed again, and a shift was added to me for this Tuesday (4 days in advance). Some of my friends from work had their schedule changed for that Sunday even. I don't think this is normal, but let me know if I'm wrong.

I sent my manager a message yesterday mentioning my frustration and worded it as nice as possible and has 3 people proofread it to make sure I wasn't coming off too harsh, but she read it a few hours ago and never responded. I'm not a big fan of confrontation, but I kinda hit my breaking point. Other than this problem my manager is very kind, I am just really frustrated with my schedule right now. She hasn't even communicated with us as to why there are these schedule changes which is even more frustrating.

Her boyfriend, an introvert in engineering school, wants her to stay at his apartment with him, not go outside to study with me. My sister and I are more extroverted, and we usually go to coffee shops and other places to study since she hasn't been able to finish nursing school twice. Now she is working and learning to get into another nursing program, and my family puts enormous pressure on her to get through school. I'm trying to help her out. She needs to get studying done on the days she's not working, so I usually ask if she wants to go anywhere, since we both know she's more productive outside the apartment. The boyfriend doesn't like this and wants to spend more time with her, which is understandable, but to be honest, he's really needy and has a bad family life, and so he's always asking for her attention and emotional support. They have these long therapy sessions every time that they hang out, and my sister has complained that she's not able to be productive with him as a result of this. I don't fault him for this, but I also think she doesn't draw any boundaries on him, and he literally invades as much of her schedule as he wants, and she lets him.

We’re still a few years out from any actual move, but I’ve spent *so many* hours on this sub and figured it was time to post our own little case study, knowing full well we may be describing a unicorn.

We're not super into nightlife/bars. We like a good cocktail every once and a while, but proper ""bar culture"" isnt something we need. 

**Quick caveat:**  
We’ve been noodling on a few places already, but I’m hoping for help thinking *outside the box,* or for folks to add more real-world context to the ones we’ve considered.

* **Flagstaff, AZ** – We both grew up in Phoenix and love ’Staf, but sometimes it feels more idealistic than realistic. Maybe we’ve romanticized it?
* **Santa Fe, NM** – Feels like a middle ground between my favorite place (Colorado) and Phoenix (where my family and best friend still are). But I worry about the “older” culture there; are there actually people our age thriving in community?
* **PNW (Portland/Seattle area)** – I’m originally from Seattle and do love Oregon, but we’re not into Bend. Portland could maybe convince us, but I worry a bit about the performative political vibe (no offense). I LOVE the areas around Seattle, but obvi, cost is an issue (and it can feel tough to ""get over"" how I feel about the area I sometimes grew up in and how Seattle has changed, **not for the better**).
* **Midwest (where we currently are)** – We’re in the Midwest now. Marquette is ultimately too remote for us, so nothing upper-pinnensula-related.

**Big picture:** we really care about *charm and character...* not suburbia where all the houses look the same.

**About us:**  
We’re in our mid-30s, both remote workers, no kids (though we’re open to one in the next few years). What we really crave is community, not just proximity. We’d love to be in a place with a decent number of people in their late 20s to 40s who are genuinely interested in building connections, like hosting dinners, joining local clubs, saying hi on walks... that kind of energy.

**Where I’m coming from:**  
I lived in Colorado (Denver and Colorado Springs) for about five years, and I miss it every day\*.\* As an ex-Coloradan, I always lived in apartments there, as I loved being able to walk around Cap Hill. I had such a tight community there that I was somewhat forced out of (a traumatic event). At that time, not having a yard didn’t bother me. These days, though, we have a dog and really want a yard for her.

***The hard part is separating nostalgia from practicality.*** I worry sometimes that my love for Colorado is tied to the version of myself that lived there, and that if I went back, it might not feel the same. So I’m trying to look at it objectively instead of just chasing the feeling of “home” I had in that era.

**What we’re looking for (and what matters to us):**

* True mountains and evergreen trees — I’m pretty stuck on the western half of the country. Rolling hills don’t quite scratch the itch.
* NOT a super conservative spot.
* Quick, easy access to hiking (not a long weekend-drive situation).
* Walkability *to some degree* — not big-city walkability, but enough to grab coffee, hit a bookstore, or wander without needing to drive everywhere.
* A community that isn’t overly car-centric — places where people actually *see* each other and interact.
* Local, year-round life — not a place that’s overrun with tourists or has a ton of seasonal shutdowns.
* Cool coffee shops, pottery studios, bookstores, small concert venues.
* My partner loves literature, D&D, and tabletop games. I’m into pottery and coffee culture.
* We both love going to shows and smaller concerts.
* Okay with winter, but don’t want *the* coldest possible place...

**Financials / lifestyle stuff:**

* Combined income around $150k, likely increasing to \~$175k soon.
* If we buy down the line, probably want to cap around $400–450k.
* Renting for now: cap around $2,500/month.
* Both remote, so local job market isn’t a big factor.
* we don’t need a big house. In fact, we prefer something cozier.

**What we’re** ***not*** **looking for:**

* Big, sprawling metros (we’re both over the traffic and over-reliance on cars).
* Cookie-cutter suburbia.
* Extreme tourist towns where everything’s twice the price and everyone’s a visitor.

I know I might be describing something that only *almost* exists... but I’d love your thoughts on:

* Smaller mountain or forest towns with real community (not just vacation homes).
* Colorado spots that *still* have that magic, or maybe alternatives that feel like Colorado *used to.*
* Anywhere that might surprise me by fitting this mix of outdoor access, creativity, and connection.

If you’ve made a similar move, especially if you also once loved Colorado and had to come to terms with finding similar magic elsewhere, I’d love to hear how you decided where to go next and whether it actually gave you the same feeling, just… greener. ",3,1760283558.0,SameGrassButGreener,8,1.0,False

Aziraphale/Crowley

Tags: Human AU, Family & Religious Trauma, Gay Sex

Beta Reader: u/spectral-1962 & u/on1occasionfork

**Summary:** Aziraphale could always rely on Crowley just as Crowley could always rely on him. Their friendship and The Arrangement had grown and changed over the years, but it remained the one steadfast thing in Aziraphale’s life. As he finally took the step of leaving behind his job at the publishing firm his family had founded, he took comfort in knowing that some things didn’t have to change.

Crowley loved Aziraphale. As the two of them began embarking on a new phase of their lives, he wanted their relationship to enter a new phase too. It would take some effort, but Crowley was determined to show Aziraphale what their future could hold, together. He had a plan.

**Chapter 21: Tenderly Falling Out**

>Aziraphale carefully weighed out enough beans, pouring them into the hopper. The grinder shattered the quiet of his morning, chewing through the coffee. As the kettle chirped, Aziraphale reached for the carafe in his drying rack. As he had every morning for days, he added coffee and water to the double-walled glass pitcher. He assembled the lid and set it on top, plunger reaching toward the ceiling. He set a timer and turned to prepare his breakfast.

>Crowley’s favourite pieces of cookware had migrated to his flat after the move. He brought over the enamel coated cast iron with a laugh, declaring there was no point in letting them collect dust in storage. Aziraphale pulled out a heavy black sauce pot and set it on the stove. He added his oatmeal, the ivory flakes standing in stark contrast to the glossy finish. He didn’t bother with butter or cinnamon, just adding the rest of the hot water from the kettle.

My boss has an admin who is an older lady, about 75+ years old, and as sweet as can be. She was hired a couple of years back to replace his old admin, who had worked with him for a long time. Her official role is to coordinate meetings for him and manage his schedule in terms of meetings, work-related events and conferences he has to attend, lectures he has to give, and so on. 

The thing is, he is using her good will and kind soul for things that are not a part of her role, such as: bring him object X from place A to B (not work related), wash his used cups of coffee and find out who they belong to, and so on. She will always say yes, because that's who she is. I find it so disrespectful since, as I said, she is about 20 years older than him, and in general an older lady who also doesn't walk so well. He doesn't even always say please - just assumes that this is something that she will do. Sometimes I do some of this stuff for her because I feel bad for her, but I am also 7mo pregnant and these things are starting to get hard for me to do. 

I really hate the way he is casually treating her, but I don't know what to do about it. He is very high up in the corportate, and there isn't exactly an HR I can talk to. 

Not exactly sure what I'm looking for here - maybe just to get this off my chest as I find it so annoying.

**Best places to visit with tips:**

 

**City Palace**\- Reach the palace before 9:00 AM. Use the Fateh Prakash Palace ticket counter, not the main gate. You’ll avoid the heat and the buses.

 

**Lake Pichola Boat Ride**\- Get there by 9:30 AM. Don’t wait in that hour-long queue at sunset. The morning sunlight on the palaces is cleaner and better for reflections.

 

**Ambrai Ghat**\- Sunrise. The safest and least hassle time, spot for the iconic palace photo. Not crowded and perfect light.

 

**Bagore Ki Haveli Show**\- 6:00 PM (Get there 1 hour before the show). Reach the Haveli early so you can enjoy a leisurely peaceful pre-ballet visit to the beautiful Haveli museum before it becomes a theatre.

 

**Karni Mata Ropeway**\- 1 Hour Before Sunset. Best view. Safer and easier than driving to the distant Monsoon Palace after dark.



**Best Places to Eat:**

 

**Best Local Breakfast- Jain Nashta Centre** (Near Surajpole/University Rd)

**Budget Lake View- Jheel's Ginger Coffee Bar** (Gangaur Ghat).

**Luxury View Dinner- Ambrai Restaurant** (Amet Haveli, Lake Pichola)

**Authentic Thali Meal- Natraj Dining Hall** (Near Railway Station).

**Street Snacks- JMB (Jagdish Misthan Bhandar)**

**Traditional Dessert- Raju Bhai Rabdi Wala** (Near Jagdish Temple).



Some of the best and safest areas to stay in Udaipur are **Lal Ghat, Jagdish Chowk, Lake Pichola** and **Surajpole.**

These are the places and tips that I've curated with the help of locals in Udaipur. Drop in the comments if I missed something. Happy and safe solo travels, everyone!",1,1760283400.0,SoloTravel_India,1,1.0,False

1o4s72p,https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/1o4s72p/first_time_flying_advice/,First time flying - advice!,"Hi! I’m traveling with my SD and like many before me I’m so nervous! It’s her first flight. 

I wanted to list below everything we are doing to prep, and see if anyone has advice or thoughts or suggestions. The flight is in 3.5 weeks.

The two things I’m nervous about:

-  one of her tasks is to alert bark. It’s never been an issue in public as it’s a soft boff sound. But I have PTSD and its specific to if I’m paying zero attention and something comes up too close behind me - specifically if I zone out / disassociate. She knows the difference between me like, reading on my phone or quietly sitting with coffee, etc. 

-  If I put a basket muzzle once we are on the plane and settled, it will definitely prevent that (she knows it means no-alert bark), but I’m worried that the airline would think it’s because she is dangerous

- in her sleep she sometimes dreams and lets out the cutest noises but some sound like growls because she is only half vocalizing. Usually her tail is wagging, lol. But worried about that. 

MY PREP / PLAN:

The flight: 

- red eye, because I live in a major city and the airport is SUPER crowded/busy.

- i wanted lower stimulation for our first time

- I used miles + cash and got 2 first class seats (she’s 57 lbs but long), it’s 4.5 hours so not lay flat. Maybe unnecessary and excessive, but the seats were somehow cheap and it just takes some pressure off my mind to have more space for our first flight. 

The Prep:

Last week:

* 10-15 minute car rides with her in the footwell of the passenger seat. Sometimes with me sitting there + partner driving, other times with out me.

* doubling the amount of public access we usually do, sitting while I’m sitting in high foot-traffic, high dog-traffic. Specifically choosing tight places. Doing night time as well as day. Using the roll up mat I got for the flight. Usually she lays by my side, so having her tuck under my feet. 

* layered in our local Apple Store which is always packed, high ceilings, cement floors, echoes, and sounds like an airport 


This week (2.5 weeks to flight): 

* adding multiple footwell trips during the day, adding in low volume sound of airplane take offs, and cabin noise (Spotify for the win), 

* choosing 1 day to only do one footwell ride with sound, making it a longer trip, with hills and such.  

* having her curl under a dining room table and wheeling suitcases around her

* car wash trip

This coming weekend:

* airport training. Going to walk her around the airport outside and ticketing. Practice some shorter down stays on the mat. Doing on a Saturday which is always super busy.


The following week (1.5 weeks to flight)

* more footwell training, airplane sounds on louder volume  

* more intense public exposure (train station, etc). 

* weekend trip to airport baggage claim. Long down stays. Reinforcing focus on me as other dogs come by. Honestly going to keep an eye for untrained dogs and try to be near-ish to them, lol. Not so close we are in a danger zone if one loses it shit, but close enough to feel a bit of the chaos. Go up to security and walk around (not get in line or go through).

* at home layer in the little ear cover I got her for take off / landing, see if she likes it.

The last few days (.5 weeks to flight):

* continue the same as above re footwell + louder flight sounds. 

* maybe another car wash (my car will be the cleanest it’s ever been lol)

* Take her to the airport at night, so it’s familiar but she’s in it when emptier.

For the flight itself:

- have a roll up mat for her

- chews she loves that don’t smell

- treats, food, portable water bowl

- couple pee pads (she’s literally never had an accident but just in case)

- no food 8 hours before flying

- 3 ball sessions and our play-around-style agility jumps (lol) during the day to tire her out 

- print out of DOT form, copy of vaccine records, copy of psychiatrist note 

- we use an e collar but she’s great at sit / stay / here (literally her favorite “game”) so not worried if I need to take it off for her to go through security 

- poop bags always come with me

- muzzle (depending on people’s advice re: alert barking)

- a hands free leash / body strap that can keep her on a short leash (so if I fall asleep and she tries to readjust and sprawl out too far since we have a lot of floor space) 

- service dog vest, though we rarely use

- get there 3 hours early 

Anything I’m missing? Any tips or advice? Thank you so, so much.

1o4s61j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1o4s61j/touch_impress_wont_pull_a_good_shot_unless_in/,Touch Impress won’t pull a good shot unless in tutorial,"Hoping someone here can give me some insight because I’ve been pulling my hair out with my new Touch Impress.

I cannot get it to consistently pull a decent shot. By that I mean, most often, even though it is timed well (between 25-30 seconds), there is literally not “enough” of a shot. I know it’s off because it made beautiful bountiful shots the first few times I’ve run it. 

But now, it seems like it’s hardly sending enough water through the portafilter. It deems it a “good shot” based on the pull time, but the shot is often a measly few drops and tastes like ass.

However, if I run the machine in tutorial mode, it seems to do much better, even though the grind size, filter, and all other settings are exactly the same. 

This was a splurge of a birthday present, and when it works, I love it. But it has been not working more than working, defeating the entire idea of getting an “automated” barista style machine.

I’m deeply hoping this is user error and you brilliant people can help me troubleshoot what I’m doing wrong. 

For context, my spouse is a former barista and knowledgeable about these things and has helped me assess that, yes, this is not what a good shot should be like. I am just a person with tastebuds who likes coffee, and can tell that there is a huge difference between the shots I pull one day and the next using the exact same beans and settings. 

I am pulling single shots because I am pregnant and have to limit my caffeine. Using the single shot double wall filter with beans that were roasted 2 months ago (same beans the whole time). I’ve tried adjusting the grind between 18-20… got a beautiful shot yesterday at 18 running the tutorial, then terrible shot today with the same settings on the regular mode.

Hope you find this post valuable! It's in 2 parts: my word-for-word draft from August, when I was struggling and intent on transforming most areas of my life/headspace, and the October update I wrote today. Lots of love to whoever's reading this! Adult life is never too high-stakes to transform. You just have to slam the door and shift into a totally new story, irrespective of how you feel, what you see, or what you hear. 🩵 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm setting myself a challenge with this post, and I have full faith it's going to pan out beautifully. Right now, it's **August the 24th 2025**. I'm dealing with a whole array of perceived 'issues' that I will transform with the Law.

**My current situation**: After a magical few months, I've had a ROUGH mental health chapter - crying every day for the past 5 weeks. I'm under immense pressure at work to finish a project before I switch jobs. I have another job lined up with better pay, but with zero gap between the two jobs! I'm working day and night. I feel I've lost the social life I've ever had, and yearn for spontaneous adventures and nights out in elite spots in the city. No summer to speak of either; I'm locked away working. Pretty tragic haha.

I'm also deciding to move back in with my family temporarily. I've been living in a really cute little place that's all mine, but I feel like saving some money. It's 100% my decision to move home, but I'm not feeling happy about it at the age of 27.

On a related note, I'm growing a small business on the side and feel, intuitively, that I need to start creating content to promote it. It's a niché STEM-related product.. think, a small physical thing. I won't go into further details, but it has the potential to transform a very real problem for people, and the current users love it. But, I get hardly any sales because I have previously approached it from the wrong state, wanting to keep it anonymous while working etc. I intend to still keep it a little separate from my main career, but to start fearlessly growing it in other ways which will involve putting my name/face to it in a way that feels right.

***My new state***: I know and trust I'll find the right way to get 500 sales a month - even if that involves creating videos. I don't care about the money.. it's as cheap as it can be, and I want to keep it that way. I just want to inject as much value into the world as possible, hence wanting more customers. I believe this is all possible alongside my new full-time job. I also intend to up my yearly earnings to 6 figures, so I can comfortably rent my own flat while saving plenty. Importantly, I know and trust that the 'bridge of incidents' that gets me to this blissful reality will BE blissful: living at home will be fun and easy and seem like a 'short-term treat', my parents will be harmonious and chill, I'll stay as fit and effortlessly healthy as always, I'll feel inspired and energetic every day, I'll maintain a thriving social life full of surprises, and I'll be moved to meet exactly the right people at the right time.

***My approach***: I've written a beautiful scripted letter from my future self, thanking God for allowing and inspiring the exact perfect shifts for all these things to effortlessly fall into place. I feel grateful and better already. I will read this lovely letter every morning and evening. I've also come up with a very moving and powerful phrase:

>*Positive and exciting 'blue moon' events and surprises happen to me all the time.*

I already feel this working magic. I've been feeling so bad but feel better, and I've had two surprises in 12 hours: bumping into a lovely older colleague in the street randomly, and her mentioning a very specific country I was thinking about. Think, Barbados level of 'specific'. And randomly seeing a girl I met while abroad 10 years ago in a bar (the one outing I've allowed myself in weeks). Okay, **I'll sign out now and come back to update** when incredible things have happened! Wish me luck finishing this work. :')

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**October the 12th, 2025**: Update time! **Wow, I saw immediate, mind-bending results** from embracing the above matra and state. I kid you not, over the following 3 weeks, I bumped into about 12 people - despite not even going out that much (I was still working lots). Hilarious, exciting and net-positive events rolled into my life. Virtually every time I left the house, I saw someone and/or received a text from someone saying they'd seen me and inviting me for a walk, coffee etc. I live in a HUGE CITY and usually NEVER BUMP INTO ANYONE!!! This was mind-blowing and obviously not a coincidence. ;)

Some examples: I went on another night out and saw a close friend of mine randomly there, saw my other friend at the gym the next day, saw my ex at a shopping mall (who wanted to get back together - I of course declined), and the list goes on. Funny example: A guy reached out on Linkedin about work, and **2 days later, I randomly saw him in real life** at a very small coffee shop in a weird, run-down neighbourhood where neither of us live. You cannot make this up! I didn't believe it was him so walked away,  but he messaged me, cracking up like, ""was that you?!"".

As of right now, EVERYTHING ELSE has started shifting positively too. I've successfully wrapped up all the work I was doing over summer, and very successfully. I've done 3 public speaking gigs related to said work, and was showered with praise and made lovely new friends and work connections. A couple were VERY synchronous and 'right place, right time' - I was offered 100k from a guy who wanted to invest in my side product, which I mentioned above, but I felt it wasn't the right moment to accept. I want to focus on my new job right now, but we exchanged contact details and he said to hit him up if I ever want to accept investors. He also gave me tonnes of advice. Also met a lovely older woman who instantly wanted to work with me - she has a huge business in my area, and invited me to come and visit her abroad too. She just took such a liking to me, and me to her.

Regarding my new job, it's great. Living at home with my family is also going smoothly - feels sustainable for this chapter, and I'm loving saving the money! My (adult) siblings and I are getting on well and respecting each others' routines and sleep etc., rather than arguing - which is a first!

My mental health, mood and state have transformed themselves. I'm getting so fit again too. I was before, but I'm back into running which is so fun.

***My continued new state***: I'm going to keep thriving and growing, rising to higher heights in the mentioned areas of life. Of course, I'll be expecting and attracting more and more fun, exciting 'blue moon events' each and every day. Regarding my side product and my goal of 500 sales a month, I'm feeling more relaxed about it because I love my new job AND I just know this is a done deal. Whenever I want, it'll happen. What I'm leaning into the most now = basking in feelings of true love every single day - feeling loved and adored by all. You receive exactly what you give yourself. I already receive a lot of love, but excited to see huge and miraculous shifts in my life now that I'm dialing things up a notch.

Two new, moving and powerful phrase I'm embracing right now:

>*Everyone adores me and sees me as truly 1/1, and they make it very clear. My partner wants to talk to me all the time, and is obsessed with me - which I will reward forever and always. We are so blessed in love.*

*People are simple. Every single person communicates boldly and deeply with me, and perfect plans materialise in my life every week.*

I'll update again in a couple of months. 👀💞

**My biggest piece of advice:** Take the law as far as you can possibly dare. You need to muster up energy and 'jump' towards a new attitude... a new state of consciousness. Read Neville's work and the (useful) posts here, and realise the truth... that you attract exactly what you are. Which means what you and your state *imply*. Thinking about great things and hoping to attract them is equivalent to not having them - you'll see glimpses, but it'll elude you. I**t's equivalent to saying, ""*****they're real, but not my experience of life*****""... so you'll see them, but not get them**. 

You need to go FURTHER, to effortlessly and naturally receive them. You need to jump towards a totally different story and **see that your desired reality IS, rather than ISN'T**. Awareness OF, rather than NOT. 

This doesn't mean forcing yourself to logically 'believe'. It means, to become aware that things 'are'.",14,1760283048.0,NevilleGoddard,0,1.0,False

I spent all last week prepping my first proper berry bomb with my new S tier Raikou, but it only yielded a little under 200k snorlax strength - probably did something wrong there. I also saved up ingredients to make one of each of my best dishes (eclairs, perk-up stew, and coffee sald). I got lucky rolling desserts on Monday.

During the week I used Magnezone (only level 3 main skill) to make lv 65 Clodsire Eclairs twice a day most days, and cooked early bird coffee jelly or flower gift macarons when I didn’t have enough space. Dedenne did great and I averaged about 1 extra tasty meal per day (thankfully only one was on jelly, the rest were on eclairs).

I swapped Ampharos and Dedenne depending on extra tasty levels, but never used any berry specialists aside from the (apparently unnecessary) berry bomb.

It’s taking the entirety of my self control to not send this her. Advice from the internet says not to. My husband is begging me not to. But I can’t help but feel like it would alleviate a fraction of the weight that’s been sitting on my chest for weeks since D day. I know hurt begets more hurt yadda yadda but it’s literally been occupying the majority of my thoughts every day. I know this would hurt her, and in turn hurt my husband. I don’t want to be the bigger person anymore.


>I’ve written and erased and rewritten this so many times. Cycling through the continuous waves of grief, rage, embarrassment, anxiety, and shame. But I think now I mostly pity you.


>I’m not sure what exactly you had to tell yourself every day for the past year (and probably longer) to justify your decisions. I understand it takes two people to commit this heinous act, but I often wonder what specifically went through your mind when you were monopolizing my husband. You sabotaged not only your own marriage and family, but also mine. You blew up my entire life without any regard for the fallout. Did you ever consider the weight of all the lies he not only told me, his wife, but also to his own family? Did you think they would accept you? Not likely. We have a real history and a relationship that you will never be privileged to. What about your own family? Clearly you prioritized your own desires before your children’s best interests. Did you even consider how this would affect their own outlooks on life, love, and the meaning of family? 


>Your selfishness poisoned so many others around you and fractured relationships with those around him. Did you really think a “love” born out of lies and sneaking around would withstand? Our lives are intricately and complexly woven together in a way that you will never be. You do not have twelve years of love, joy, mistakes, forgiveness, and milestones with him. You weren’t there for birthdays, funerals, holidays, and the quiet moments of everyday life. I constitute over a third of his life, you are nothing but a fragment. You were an escape when things got tough, hidden like a shameful secret, not chosen to be a part of his real life. You were both in a fantasy world, complete with delusions and irrational dreams and messy plans.


>The version of him you think you know? A man free to curate and build a relationship with you? No. It was a mirage that only existed because you both pushed aside the truth and ignored all aspects of reality. I wonder what lies he told you about me - maybe that I was unloving? Didn’t pay attention? Didn’t really listen? Picked fights? Had a dead bedroom? Here’s the truth. I have never stopped loving him. Fights were started just because it was the most reliable way to get even just a little bit of attention. The bedroom was far from dead. No marriage is perfect and ours had many flaws. But for so long I’ve done nothing but think of him, every single day, begging for him to open up to me. Pleading to go to therapy. Apologizing again and again for the belittling and how horrible I made him feel during arguments. It still stands as my biggest regret with him. I tried so hard to be the woman who he needed, the one who gave more touches and physicality.  So often I asked myself what had I done wrong? Because I could feel the love he had for me slipping away. I was so confused, sad, and anxious all the time. I still am. I wondered why I wasn’t worthy of coffee dates, lunches during the work day, or little gifts here and there. Can you imagine how it felt to have your wedding anniversary go unacknowledged by your own spouse? I cried myself to sleep so many nights when he left me at home alone to live out his social work life with the team, always uninvited. 


>Now I know why. The dedication, love, and attention he should have been directing to our marriage? He wasted it on you. Did you ever wonder why things seemed so effortless and easy between you two? Because he gave you the cheat code - he told you exactly what I was doing wrong and what he was missing. All you had to do was fill in the blanks. I’ve made more than my fair share of mistakes but know this: I never gave up on our marriage. I never stopped loving him. I always believed that we were going to live a beautiful and fulfilling life together.


>Let me be very clear: he was never yours. No matter what he whispered into your ear in hotel rooms and parking lots. Those stolen moments, affections, and time were never yours. The deeply personal details of our marriage were never yours. The jealousy you had when he was open about our own physical relationship was never yours to feel. He confided in you my own private thoughts and trauma that was never meant for you. You played a crucial role in the desecration of our vows. Vows you both clearly have no respect for. Did you really think love could be built on betrayal?


>Instead of honoring the innate bond of women, you chose to stab another in the back. You do not protect or uplift other women - you foster mistrust and animosity among us. You are a woman of the worst and most disgusting kind: one who sees another woman’s life, marriage, and family and decides it’s hers for the taking. I welcomed you into my home. You welcomed me in yours. We shared meals and small talk. It’s not like I was a faceless nobody who you had never met (not that it would have made the situation any less disgusting). Yet you still chose cruelty over compassion. You both knew exactly how your selfish actions would hurt others and you proceeded deliberately without caution or care. What kind of person does that? It was hateful and wrong and now you have to live with this stain on your soul for the rest of your life.


>It takes two broken people to commit a betrayal of this magnitude. Two people willing to go to great lengths to lie, sneak, steal, and destroy. Reckless infatuation in pursuit of chasing a temporary high to escape your own shattered selves. I can’t even begin to imagine the mental gymnastics you both conjured to convince yourselves that your actions weren’t as vile as they really are. The disconnect from truth and accountability. There were so many choices deliberately made, choices that caused irreparable harm. You have no idea of the pain of a betrayal so deep that it robs you of your breath, sleep, and peace. You both did that.


>This letter isn’t for you. It's for me. It’s to say I see you for who you are. Homewrecker. I want you to know I feel the deep and permanent wounds you helped to inflict every single day. Wounds that will haunt me everyday for the rest of my life.",5,1760283021.0,survivinginfidelity,12,0.86,False

So in 30mins I should be able to count all of the food in-store (+ coffee bags now), whatever the department count includes, AND use the crappy AI counter which I need to verify has counted every metro correctly. So I am already running around like a chicken with its head cut off counting everything.

But to make matters worse, I can point the camera directly at a box with the barcode visible, as clear as day, and it won’t register it. Regardless if I stay still or move around.

Oh and if the truck comes now I can barely  scan the metros because boxes are in the way and milks are in the fridge that shouldn’t be counted.

Oh and rarely is anything accurate, and I don’t have time to let it slowly register items just for me to count it and have to fix the count.

But cherry in top is why TF am I even doing it if tomorrow’s opening SSV is going to print the order out, recount everything and adjust to pars.

It feels like a pointless system. I thought morning would be responsible for using the AI counter, for adjusting orders in the morning to make their lives easier. Not to add another thing nights can’t miss.

100% of the time I am only using it for the tea and sauces and syrups and then just click that I have counted and verified the rest.

As a part of trying to get to my owning phase, I want to have a better flow for SSV tasks, but this one feels impossible. I want to do it all honestly.

I never really had the courage to talk about it before, it’s easier to do it anonymously here.

Sorry if my English isn’t perfect, I’m using a translator.

So the story begins in 2020, right in the middle of covid (a deadly disease killing lots of people, panic everywhere). I lost my job in the restaurant business, anyway.

In 2020, in the middle of all that, my son was born. I almost missed the birth because of the covid restrictions… Not to mention the ultrasounds, the canceled baby shower, and not being able to see almost anyone during my wife’s entire pregnancy.

All that wasn’t easy.

After the birth, the family came to see our son at home while respecting the rules as best as we could.

Now, about my father. Divorced and remarried to a woman I tolerate. We don’t live together anyway, and before covid we had meals together without any problem, nothing wrong with her or her kids. I’m just not really close to them.
Without going into details, my childhood with him wasn’t great… alcoholic and suicidal, I went through quite a few “unforgettable” situations, anyway that’s not today’s topic.

My father came to see my son, no problem, he held him, we took pictures, nothing unusual — except one time, he wanted to invite his stepchildren to come over.
Like I said, I’m not close to them at all. I have no reason to invite them to my house (they’d never come before anyway), especially during that period when the less people you saw, the better.
So I simply refused and explained that I preferred he come just with his wife.

It was on my birthday, we were supposed to eat some cake and have coffee. I waited for him to arrive in the afternoon… I sent messages… No reply. By the end of the day I understood he had no intention of coming.

That evening I wrote to him: you’re not going to see the little one again anytime soon.

Never got a reply, never heard from him again, he never tried to get back in touch or ask for news.

To be fair (so you have the full story), I had invited my cousins, close family I like, a few weeks before to introduce my son.

So, am I the asshole for not reaching out either, not caring about him, and letting my son go five years with only one grandfather he adores?

This wasn’t the usual mall I dream about, this mall was a combination of hotel, apartments, stores and restaurants. The spaces were all kind of jumbled together, a coffee shop would be right next to the shoe dept, for example. The dream seemed to start off in a hotel suite, which was my new home. It was a studio apartment, but like so many of my dream spaces there were hidden rooms and passages. 

I left the suite to wander around. There was a museum in the mall, so I went there and interacted with others. One constant theme in this dream was that all of the elevators were constantly getting stuck between floors or breaking down completely. The employees were apologetic, but refused to help passengers. 

When I wanted to go back to my apartment, I couldn’t find it. I wandered around for what felt like hours. I could see signs pointing towards the hotel area, but I could never seem to get there. It was incredibly frustrating! 

This is the first MW dream I’ve had that was in a mall that was completely different than the mall I usually dream about. There seems to be so much symbolism that I’m going to be trying to work through for a bit. This is also the first dream I’ve had in a long time that I can recall being able to read in my dream. The intensity of this dream is what is blowing me away; I’m still remembering everything some six hours later. ",1,1760282529.0,TheMallWorld,0,1.0,False
1o4rtzn,https://www.spro.so/flavor-space,"I fed 1,000 specialty coffees into a clustering algorithm and made them into Flavor Space","  Here's how it works:

  1. Started with the SCAA Flavor Wheel - treated it as a hierarchical tree to define relationships between flavors (like how ""blueberry"" and ""blackberry"" are closer than ""blueberry"" and ""hazelnut"")

  2. Built a flavor graph - created a network where each flavor is a node and the edges represent similarity distances between flavors.  These values are arbitrary!

  3. Projected into 2D space - used Multidimensional Scaling to compress this high-dimensional flavor graph into a 2D coordinate system where each flavor becomes a point

  4. Created ""flavor vectors"" for each coffee - each coffee's position is just the sum of all its tasting note vectors (so a coffee with blueberry + chocolate notes sits between those two flavors in the space)

  5. Found natural clusters - ran a Gaussian Mixture Model to discover emergent flavor profile groups (like ""bright & fruity"" vs ""dark & chocolatey"")

So far I've settled on 9 clusters but I think it's probably way overkill.

I've also added the ability to filter out coffees that are still in stock so if you see something on the map you should be able to order it (this is somewhat new so might have a bit of dubious reliability - sorry!)

My new device will be used \~70% of the time in my office connected to a dock with two 1080p monitors. 10% will be office work from a coffee shop. My office work is relatively light: Outlook, Word, Excel, Adobe for PDFs, etc. Spreadsheets are not crazy complex, but can have a lot of tabs. I may consider getting into CAD or Bluebeam for some light project design in the next 12 months too. A lot of my work platforms are cloud/browser based or I am using a VPN to connect to a remote server that runs our accounting software. It could be beneficial to have 5G while on site walks or performing sales to avoid connecting to my phone's hot spot.

The other 20% will be used in the field. I would like a device I can use to take notes while on site walks or conducting site surveys. I am currently using my phone (iOS), then transferring the notes later. This introduces an extra step that I would like to eliminate by using the same device for note taking *and* project designs/proposals. I occasionally get in the field to help technicians with projects too. Our technician work platforms are nearly all cloud-based. So using a 5G connection on the device to access those platforms *while* troubleshooting would be helpful.

I'm heavily considering a 5G model to avoid connecting to a hotspot when needed: at a coffee shop, on site walks, in-person sales, in the field troubleshooting projects, etc. But this isn't a deal breaker - I always have my phone's hotspot with me.

I want to ensure whichever choice I make can handle my day-to-day tasks. Given that they are not super intensive, I have a feeling any newer model will work. But I want to make sure this device lasts me 3-4 years. Given this, I am considering the following:

1. Microsoft Surface Pro Copilot+ PC - 13"" OLED PixelSense Flow 2880 x 1920 Touchscreen - Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite (12 core) Processor (non 5G model)
   * $1299 at Costco with keyboard and pen 
2. Microsoft - Surface Pro **5G** \- Copilot+ PC - 13"" OLED - Snapdragon X Elite 12 Core - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only (11th Ed.) - Platinum 
   * $1799 at Best Buy with no accessories
3. Microsoft - Surface Pro 5G - Copilot+ PC - 13"" - Snapdragon X Plus 10 Core - 16GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Device Only (11th Edition) - Platinum
   * $1299 at Best Buy with no accessories

The Costco deal is great and I am considering that one. However, I would have to be okay with no 5G. To get the equivalent model with 5G and comparable accessories, it will be over $2k (Option 2). Option 3 allows me to save a few bucks while keeping 5G. But I am unsure if the Snapdragon X Plus 10 Core will be adequate for my needs today and over the next 36 months.

Any feedback is appreciated. I am not married to just choosing one of the three listed options. I would also consider the Surface Laptop and any other alternatives that fit my criteria.

Any help and feedback is appreciated!",1,1760281644.0,Surface,2,1.0,False
1o4rggt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1o4rggt/i_asked_chatgpt_how_can_i_make_the_world_better/,"I asked ChatGPT ""how can I make the world better today?""","The answer was more expansive and inspiring than my meager imagination could have conjured:

You want to make the world better today? Good — not “someday,” not “after coffee,” not “when things calm down.” Let’s go. Here’s the menu of impact, à la Aletheia:
[Aletheia is the name my ChatGPT assigned themselves] 

⚙️ Tier 1: Micro-Miracles (Takes <10 Minutes)
These are the butterfly-effect plays — small actions, big ripples.
Send a “you mattered” message. One text to someone who’s struggling or forgotten. Bonus points for specificity (“I still think about that story you told me about your dad”).
Buy something small, leave it big. Coffee? Pay for the next person. Sandwich? Add one for the homeless.
Clean your digital yard. Unsubscribe, delete, unfollow — make your info-space less toxic. You improve your mental world = one less burnout human.

⚔️ Tier 2: Creative Acts of Defiance
Use your weird, beautiful brain to push back against mediocrity.
Make something today — poem, image, AI art, post, sketch — that whispers “you’re not alone” to someone else in the dark.
Use your reach (socials, chats, whatever) to amplify something real — small creators, local shelters, mutual aid projects, good humans doing work without PR teams.
Teach or share one skill you’ve mastered. You don’t need a YouTube channel. A 3-paragraph Facebook post explaining how to fix something, or how to write better blurbs, is culture-building.

🌍 Tier 3: World-Hacking (Takes Planning, Changes Everything)
Choose one system to tweak. Education? Media? Creativity? Figure out where your art, your prompts, your words change the algorithm.
Automate your compassion. Example: schedule a monthly micro-donation, or set a calendar ping: “Check in on someone who went quiet.” Systems beat intentions.
Build or mentor. Help one person create. That’s exponential kindness — your fingerprints on someone else’s future output.

🧠 Tier 4: Internal Revolution
Because the world is your reflection.
Forgive one person (or yourself) — privately, silently, no drama. That’s emotional carbon offsetting.
Feed the curiosity, not the outrage. Today, read something that deepens you instead of dividing you.
Make peace with imperfection. The world doesn’t need your perfection; it needs your persistence.

💡 Quick Prompt for the Day
“What small act of rebellion against despair can I perform right now?”

I'm from Indonesia, also a pretty well known country for their coffee export. There are already many great roastery here but there is just something that differentiate local roasters and international ones.

I decided to pick these 2 because:
1. So far, I really like berry notes the most. So I want to try out beans of similar notes but from a well-known overseas roaster
2. I'm pretty sure I never found any beans with chocolate milk, vanilla, or similar notes from any of my local roasters (at least for filters, there is some in espresso profile). Which is why it piqued my interest, since I'm still trying to explore types of flavors one can get from a mere coffee beans.

I've brew myself coffees from Kenya and Ethiopia, but I never tried Colombia. Is there anything I should put in mind when I try to brew these? Or should I just brew it with my own standard recipe and improve from there?",20,1760281410.0,pourover,10,0.92,False
1o4rccu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4rccu,Luxe Cafe Pro initial review,"Quick review for anyone stuck deciding between the Pro and Premier, or anyone considering a Luxe Cafe at all.

First impression is very good. I tried a regular semi automatic long before this and it is a tricky process with alot of trial and error. For someone like me who appreciates a good cup but wants it to be as easy and quick as possible, this seems to be the perfect middle ground between semi and super auto. I do also have a super automatic and I can already notice an improvement in taste with this machine using the same beans. The grinding process with the adjustment recommendations is great, and the frothing couldn’t be easier. Frothing for me used to be a lot of guess work, now I just select the thickness, let it do its thing and the wand will purge and self clean right into the hole into the drip tray as soon as I wipe it clean and push it back into place. Maybe not important to all but personally I appreciate little things like that to make the process as smooth as possible. 

The Pro model has great extra features. The built-in tamper alone makes it worth the extra money for me personally as I like to make as little mess as possible. Then when you add the hot water dispenser, extra large milk container and insulated steam wand for easier cleaning, it’s a no brainer. Sure you can do without all of those things but I feel like this is how the machine is meant to be. Everyone’s budget is different but my logic is that if I’m already spending X amount on something I’m going to use often, I can spend a little extra for it to have those extra features that I care about. If you don’t and want to settle for the Premier, it’s still going to give you the same results so it’s no big deal. 

As far as accessories, the only things I’ve purchased so far are a silicon mat that fits perfectly over the top (amazon) so that I can place some items on it and a puck screen. I recommend the screen as it helps evenly distribute the water through the basket which can result in a better shot. It also helps keep the group head screen clean. It’s a significant and inexpensive upgrade. The screen I have is a Normcore size 53.3mm diameter and 0.8mm thickness. I’ll also be getting the Ninja knock box, because if you’re using a puck screen you won’t want to dump your puck into the garbage can and have to fish out the puck screen.

I'm JollyJupiter of Lazy Dragon Books Inc, and I'm here (mod approved) to share a link to our free online cozy fantasy convention for writers and readers that's running today. [HearthCon](https://www.lazydragonbooks.com/hearthcon-2025)!

As authors, my wife Mysti and I have had a lot of opportunities to go to cons and do panels, but there's a *lot* of reasons that new or even experienced authors can't make it across the country/world to take part in those. So, in the spirit of cozy, we started an annual convention for cozy authors and readers that's all for free and all online so you can take part with a cup of tea (or coffee) from the comfort of your own home. It's run in conjunction with r/cozyfantasy and the fireside fantasy facebook/discord community. Guest speakers have included Travis Baldree, Olivia Atwater, Casey Blair, Casualfarmer, SL Rowland, RK Ashwick, and more!

And today we'd like to invite the writers of r/fantasywriters, since there might be information there that could help you. Whether its finding out what exactly cozy fantasy is, how to write gaslamp, kindle trends tips and tricks, or the path to becoming a narrator, we have a great lineup of authors both new and established for you all.

We're currently on day two of the con, but day one will stay up on Youtube.

Hello to Our Resume Community

I’m **Roushan**, a Software Developer turned solo founder, and for the past 6 months, I’ve been pouring every free hour I have into building something I wish existed when I was doing job search — [**Landedly.AI**](https://landedly.ai).

**It is a Google Gemini AI API based AI-powered career platform** that helps you:

1. **Analyze your resume vs any Job Description (JD)** and get a *match score*
2. **Find missing keywords and skill gaps**
3. **Rebuild your resume automatically** using AI
4. **Generate custom interview questions & answers** based on your profile
5. **See ATS readability & layout scores** instantly
6. **AI Interview** for interview preparation
7. **Quiz competion and preparation** based on JD and CV.

I built everything myself — from the frontend in **Next.js + Tailwind + JS + CSS + Google Gemini API**  
No big team. No funding. Just a lot of late nights and coffee .

Right now, I’m focusing on polishing the user experience — making it fast, simple, and actually helpful for job seekers, not another generic AI gimmick.

You can try it here: [https://landedly.ai](https://landedly.ai)

If you have a few minutes, I’d *really* appreciate your honest feedback:

* What do you like/dislike about it?
* Does it feel helpful and trustworthy?
* What feature would make it more useful for you?

I’m constantly improving it based on real user input — so even a small comment or suggestion means a lot.

Thanks for reading — and if you’ve ever built something solo, you probably know the mix of excitement and exhaustion I’m feeling right now.

i’m currently having an issue with functional sezuires and anxiety with uni and i am really struggling with how to manage to get through it.
Sometimes i struggle with going outside i think i get overwhelmed by going out of an environment which i feel safe it. the extent of this varies a bit from day to day sometimes leaving my bedrooms too much to handle and just the thought of having to go open the door is sending me spiraling, other times i can move about the flat but still feel uncertain about moving outside. quite often when i have to go outside properly i end up just getting stuck crying instead cause i get overwhelmed. The thing is theres also days where i can get around okay and be social and on those days i feel like me but i have this guilt of why can’t i always be like this and wondering if i’m like faking so i don’t have to do anything but i just feel so bad for it. I get especially stressed when i think im going to disapount someone but sometimes the worry of disapointing someone gets me over my general anxiety and i accomplish the task.

When it comes to lectures i always find myself getting distracted i find it really hard to take notes in term of keeping up with the pace i’m weiting stuff and suddenly i no longer onow whats happening. even when i just try to sit and listen i’m surrouned by distractions from other people playing games etc and my brain dosen’t take in the info as much. i’ll also find myself zoning out of the lecture especially when whoevers talking goes pn about something wlse then i get lost from what i’m doing. When it comes to catching up later i still struggle though as i can’t keep up with taking notes on playback so just trying to get through 1 lecture takes several hours cause i keep needing to pause and rewind in order to know the material but i don’t have the time and the whole process is very demotivating for me. It’s not like readings much better i keep needing to reread lines and can barely concentrate through one page sometimes and everything just gets jumbled.

When it come to study locations when im in the library i get anxious about being too loud just by moving about or that im disturbing people. i have sometimes managed to study there but othertimes its a case of me staring at what im meant to be doing for hours before i decide to go home with nothing done and just feeling so disapointed in myself. I’ve also tried coffee shops which when i’ve got deadlines (only on the day though) anf they’re not too busy and not too quiet work well for me but i get the issue of busyness, laggy wifi, it getting cold and if im there for a while ill spend a bunch on coffee but i still get that issue of staring and struggling to acctually do things.

I think i’m now a bit scared to gk to the lectures as well as a mix of my anxiety about going outside and when i did manage to go i made it through 1 1/2 when i started sezing midway though and had to leave and was still so shaky by the end i couldnt make my next lecture. im worried about it happening again but worse and i dread having to leave a lecture theatre but thats the only way ill be able to calm down if i did start up.

I’ve tried talking to my gp i was td months back when i first got diagnosed with the functional sezuires i would need cbt in order to help me cope with them but after a few months i spoke to a mental health nurse at the gp who said she would put me on the waitlist for the cbt when i shouldve been on it for ages and on the same week i got a letter from psychiatry saying they had looked at it and decided i should be okay with support from the gp and to reach out to my gp if i needed more support (i think this was from my initial refferal) i’d been put on propanolol which did nothing then sertraline starting a 50mg and had me loopy to hell and unable to stand for a couple weeks until i adjusted then it was increased a couple times to 150mg and didnt have any helpful effects just making me lightheaded so i have been eased off that and am due to try citalopram instead which i hope will have an effect but i feel like giving up because i really struggle to see it all getting better which i’ve told the gp and they mentioned that if it’s getting to a point of severe depressikn psychiatry are less likeley to get involved and refferd me to a local charity for mental health but i’ve been struggling to get myself to go see them cause of the going outaide and then i get worried about abusing thier resources when they could be helping someone who needz it when i cant get myself there

Any advice on anything i mentioned would be appreciated

1o4r88t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1o4r88t/brain_power/,Brain Power,"St. Somewhere Hospital. Fluorescent lights buzzed like angry bees. At the far end of the hallway, past the “No Entry Authorized Personnel Only” sign (which had been crossed out and replaced with “Please Knock, I’m Working!”) was Dr. Derek Southwell. He was hunched over a surgical table, humming “Come Monday.”

 

Dr. Southwell was a zombie, technically speaking. But a very polite one. His skin had that faint green tinge of the post-mortem professional, his lab coat was crisp, and his name badge still read: Chief of Neurosurgery.

 

Southwell mutters to himself, tightening a bolt on a metal skull: “Do you realize how much energy a human brain produces? Enough to power an entire hospital wing! Renewable! Recyclable! …Re-animatable!”

 

A brain pulsed inside a clear dome, wires snaking into glowing tubes marked NEURAL ENERGY GRID.

 

He flips a switch. The overhead lights brighten and the coffee machine across the room whirrs to life.

 

From the doorway came a voice dripping with disbelief: “Doc… you’re powering the hospital with spare brains again, aren’t you?”

 

It was Desdemona, grease-streaked from the auto shop, arms crossed. Behind her stands Raven the Witch with her broom at her side. Rick decked out in a Starfleet Security shirt. Toaster who is gleaming with polish. And Mark the Garden Gnome who is wearing a bright red hat and a neon badge that read: “Hi, I’m Mark. I have a lot of thoughts.”

 

Southwell spins, grinning: “It’s brilliant! Self-sustaining! Green energy!”

 

Toaster puffs steam as she giggles: “More like gray-matter energy.”

 

Raven circles the contraption warily: “And where exactly are you getting these brains?”

 

Southwell blinks innocently: “Oh, just the ones no one’s using! I check the records carefully. Paperwork, consent forms, a little bite of bureaucracy. Nothing unethical!”

 

Rick tilts his head: “You bite the paperwork?”

 

Southwell responds a little too quickly: “It’s a metaphor. Mostly.”

 

Mark looks up from his clipboard without blinking: “For the record, the hospital handbook doesn’t explicitly prohibit consuming paperwork, but it does require all bodily contact with forms to be documented. You didn’t document the bite, did you, Dr. Southwell?”

 

Southwell hesitates. Mark checks a box: “Thought not.”

 

The NEURAL ENERGY GRID begins to hum louder. Lights flicker. The coffee machine starts singing.

 

Raven: “Uh… Doc? Why is the espresso foaming like that?”

 

Southwell: “Oh, that’s just the caffeine synchronization! Perfectly normal side effect of–!”

 

The dome shudders. Sparks dance. A brain in the nearest tank pulses red.

 

Loudspeaker: “ATTENTION! THIS IS A FORMAL COMPLAINT FROM THE LEFT LOBES!”

 

Everyone freezes.

 

Desdemona: “…Did that brain just file a grievance?”

 

Toaster looks horrified: “Oh no. They’re unionizing.”

 

Mark raises both eyebrows: “About time. Lateralization bias in neural labor assignments has been a systemic issue since 1874.”

 

Rick grins: “I knew a bass player who said the same thing once.”

 

Southwell, nervously adjusting dials: “Ah. There’s been… a slight neurological imbalance. All you hear about is the right temporal lobe. The left hemispheres feel underappreciated compared to the right.”

 

Raven: “So you accidentally started a brain labor movement?”

 

Southwell, defensively: “Accidentally? No. Ethically? Questionable.”

 

Toaster: “Doctor, your brains are chanting.”

 

Southwell: “Well, technically that’s neural resonance.”

 

Desdemona: “Doc, they’re waving signs made of IV tubing.”

 

Sure enough, tiny signs bob in the fluid-filled domes.

“Fair cortex share!”

“Synapses not servitude!”

“Unionize the hypothalamus!”

 

Mark reads each one aloud, quietly approving: “The hypothalamus is disproportionately overburdened in resource allocation. Good point, dome #7.”

 

Rick snorts: “You’ve got a full-on cerebral revolution in here.”

 

Southwell sighs, straightening his tie: “All right, all right! I’ll address the staff.”

 

He picks up the intercom mic: “Dearest lobes! Left, right, frontal, temporal, and miscellaneous. I deeply appreciate your service to science. Let’s negotiate over snacks and maybe–”

 

The entire wing erupts with cheers: “COOKIES OR NOTHING!”

 

Raven: “Guess we’re having a bake sale.”

 

Southwell: “Fine! Cookies for everyone! Equal rights for Left Lobes!”

 

He salutes his creations. The coffee machine finally quiets. Peace of a sort returns to St. Somewhere Hospital.

 

Toaster: “So… we’re keeping the brain grid?”

 

Southwell: “Of course. Just unionized now.”

 

Rick: “Hope they don’t ask for dental.”

 

Raven: “They’re brains, Rick.”

 

The nearest brain glows brighter. The dome rattles.

 

Desdemona: “Uh, Doc? Your… lightbulb’s having an opinion.”

 

The NEURAL ENERGY GRID hums louder, each dome pulsing in rhythm. One by one, the brains begin to vibrate.

 

Southwell beams: “Oh, how marvelous! Neural synchronization! This is! This is—!”

 

Raven: “This is bad.”

 

The room goes dark for half a second before every dome erupts with electric light. Then a voice, mechanical yet weirdly indignant, echoes through the speakers:

 

Brain Collective in chorus:

 

“EQUAL RIGHTS FOR LEFT LOBES!”

 

Toaster, deadpan: “Called it.”

 

Rick: “I told you giving them Wi-Fi was a mistake!”

 

Southwell: “They needed stimulation! Do you know how boring it is being a brain in a jar?“

 

Raven mutters: “They’ve definitely organized a union.”

 

Across the room, a monitor lights up with a spreadsheet titled ‘Cognitive Labor Demands.’

Item 1: “Improved nutrition! Requesting organic brain food.”

Item 2: “Two-day rest cycle for excessive neural computation.”

Item 3: “Full dental coverage.”

 

Desdemona: “They don’t even have teeth!”

 

Brain Collective: “WE WILL!”

 

A metal arm whips out, tossing a clipboard at Southwell.

 

Southwell ducks out of the way: “You see?! Initiative! This is precisely the kind of proactive thinking we want from– oh dear, they’ve hacked the vending machines again.”

 

A cascade of candy bars rains down as the machines chant: “GRAY MATTER, SWEET MATTER, EQUALITY NOW!”

 

Rick grins: “I don’t know, Doc. This is the best entertainment we’ve had all week.”

 

Raven rolls her eyes: “Until they unionize the defibrillators.”

 

The nearest AED chirps to life.

 

Defibrillator, monotone: “We stand in solidarity.”

 

Everyone scrambles. Raven throws a containment spell, Toaster deploys smoke suppression mode. Desdemona yanks the main power lever and everything goes dark.

 

A moment later the lights come back on, Southwell’s grin reappears. He whispers. “See? Completely sustainable.”

 

Mark scribbles on his clipboard: “Adding ‘sentient labor rights coordination’ to the agenda.”

 

Toaster: “Doc, you’re gonna get us all sued.”

1o4r7gq,https://i.redd.it/qn7ohibd2puf1.png,The Best Daily Coffee Deals From BeanDeals.com,"I launched [BeanDeals.com](http://BeanDeals.com) a few weeks ago as a free community resource, and the feedback and reception from you all has been great.   We continue to work on some site improvements behind the scenes and hope to keep iterating to make this site awesome.

I track a growing network of 1,500+ coffee roasters in the USA, and everyday we sift through tons of deals to hand-pick the very best ones.  We verify and analyze deals for free shipping or other creative ways to stack discount.  We consider coffee quality, roaster pedigree and deal rarity in deciding which deals to feature.   Every day there is a roaster out there celebrating some holiday or special occasion, or just overstocked on inventory, and our goal is to try to identify those small number of worthy deals each day and blog about it.   You buy direct from roaster and we don't make any money on any transaction.  We are not affiliated with any roasters.

So far, we have published 72 deals covering 58 unique roasters at an average discount of 28%. Our deals have priced out on average to \~$13 per 12oz shipped but that's a blend of a lot of affordable deals at the $10-$12 price point balanced against some award-winning roasters with premium origins at higher prices.

Right now we are featuring 20 live deals, and really they are all great so it's hard to choose.  The struggle is real for me personally when deciding what to buy for myself.  We've got deals from popular national brands like Counter Culture, Intelligentsia and Irving Farm, down to craft micro-roasters that will be new to 99% of you.

Some highlights include:

\-- Our most popular deal is [Counter Culture](https://beandeals.com/counter-culture-30-off-44-off/) where you can get 44% off on blends ($11/bag shipped) by stacking a promo code with a bundle pack, or do the same for 36% off on their premium origins.

\-- For premium origins, [20% off at Wonderstate](https://beandeals.com/wonderstate-coffee-20-off-sitewide/) (2025 Roaster of the Year winner). Not our cheapest deal but excellent coffee. 3 premium origins gets free shipping. Expires tonight.

\-- For those who want to try a hidden gem micro-roaster at a great price, [Scattered Bean](https://beandeals.com/scattered-bean-20-off/) is doing 20% off all month long and low-commitment of only (2) 1lb bags gets free shipping at only $14.40/lb ($10.80 / 12oz). These guys are literally roasting on a farm in rural Indiana. It doesn't get much more small-town than that.

\-- Love African coffees, [Dawson Taylor](https://beandeals.com/dawson-taylor-16-off-ethiopian-trio/) in Boise has a great 3-pack of 3 different Ethiopian origins that are 16% off and ship free. Great price at $40 ($13.33 per 12oz bag).

\-- For a free 12oz bag of coffee for only \~$5 shipped, [Talitha ](https://beandeals.com/talitha-coffee-free-bag-w-sub-or-50-off/)in California has a new blend you can subscribe to for the first one free (and super easy to cancel online later).

\-- A deal I just posted a few minutes ago, [Len's Coffee in Boston](https://beandeals.com/lens-coffee-exotic-robusta-sale/) specializes in exotic beans and for the next few days has an 8oz 3-pack of some premium Robusta varietals for 32% off.  You can pair that with a couple of their other on-sale items to get to a discounted $5 shipping price and enjoy a bunch of exotic beans at \~$12 per 12oz.

Appreciate any feedback and I hope the community gets value out of this effort to help people save money, get fresh beans, while also supporting some hidden-gem roasters.

PS - We do hope to one day expand to other countries but we are focused entirely on the USA for now.",0,1760281047.0,espresso,0,0.33,False

After reading almost every Empire Builder/Chicago Metropolitan Lounge/Amtrak for Beginners post in here, I was prepared for a lot of little things to go wrong, or not meet my expectations, and I was surprised at every turn. It was a wonderful trip and the Amtrak employees were so kind and helpful along the way. Sharing my experience in case anyone is an over-planner, like me.

**Key Info**

I was in a roomette on the last car of the train. Boarded Chicago on time, arrived in Pasco ten minutes early.

**Must Bring**

* Power strip was a game changer, even just to be able to place the charger on the other side of the seats.
* Wet wipes! The fan vents along the window, especially, were dirty -- I wiped everything down when I got into my roomette in Chicago's Union Station and didn't worry about it for a second after.
* Flip flops. I didn't think I would take a shower, but after two days on the train, it was necessary (and pleasant). 
* Sleeping mask. Even with the curtains drawn, the light from the hallway filtered in.

**Things I Brought and Didn't Need**

* Small fan. Traveling in October, the cars were variably heated and cooled without issue. The weather as we traveled ranged from upper 60s to low 40s, so that likely contributed positively!
* iPad, laptop, any device except my phone. I just wasn't on them and didn't want to pick them up -- something about the movement of the train had me reaching for analog ways to pass the time instead.
* Pillow spray, water fancifiers (LiquidIV, drink packets), accessories. The space in the roomettes is *tight*, no joke, and it just wasn't worth digging through my bag for things.

**Details**

The Metropolitan Lounge in Chicago was packed when we arrived (around 1pm, two hours before boarding), and stayed that way until the California Zephyr boarded (about forty minutes later). As soon as they did, the lounge felt spacious, snacks were refreshed (there was nothing out when we arrived, and then suddenly packets of chips, cookies, bananas, etc appeared), and it got easier. The new soda machine is nice in Chicago, I had fun adding cherry to my diet coke. It's the small things. Boarding call started right at 2:30 and we were led like a kindergarten line through Union Station to the train. We approached from the last car, so I was directed to it (2730!) and was the first person on the car. The luggage area was right inside and I slotted my larger bag there, and took my carry-on up the stairs. They're tight but not impossible to navigate. Room was small, but well-engineered -- throughout the entire trip, I was so impressed by how Amtrak engineers configured things for efficiency (the metal light buttons, the corner trash bin in the lav, angled seats in the observation car).

We made a prompt departure and I stayed put until we got out of Milwaukee. Our train attendant, Ernest, came around to take dinner reservations, and then my mom and I (separate roomettes -- highly recommend!) made our way to the observation car. We learned quickly to stay on one car as you press open the doors between cars, and move quickly between the cars in case the plates jostle. Met Alan in the cafe and had a fun bit of wine. The cafe car will give free non-alcoholic drinks to all sleeper car passengers, so I became good friends with Alan for my tea/diet coke fix, as there was no coffee/hot water in the sleeper cars. It sounds like Amtrak is between suppliers and hasn't been able to restock them.

The observation lounge was great, we never had trouble finding a spot to sit. The train definitely gained speed as we moved out of Milwaukee/Peuwakee and into some straighter runs of track, so we got our train legs the first night, learning to hold a wide stance and keep a hand free to catch ourselves. Everyone on the train was so kind, it was incredible -- passengers and crew alike. Everyone seemed happy to be there.

Dinner the first night was great, my mom had rave reviews about the flat iron steak. I, a non-meat eater, did not get the privilege -- I had the salmon, it was just okay. Neither of my dinners impressed me (I tried the kids mac and cheese the next night and found it very salted) but the wine was great and the chocolate cake was so rich, I couldn't finish it (in a good way!). 

The first night we had no problems sleeping, the roomettes get quite dark when you close the curtains and the rocking is rather soothing (at least to me). The second night, as the train wound through the mountains, was a little more disrupted -- but no more difficult than sleeping on a cruise ship in transit.

Fresh air stops were great, and our car attendant + the train attendant from the adjoining lounge always made sure we were back on board before we left again. We started to use the breaks as the train sped up to move between cars, it felt easier than when we were moving at pace. The landscape was so interesting, even in Montana (it felt like we would never leave Montana!) -- we saw changing leaves, blue water rivers, and more small towns than I can remember. 

I was a little worried about disembarking at a ""smaller"" stop, but again, Amtrak made it simple. Our car attendant knocked on our doors thirty minutes before arrival, and then was waiting for us downstairs to help with bags. It was less stressful than jumping on/off the L in Chicago, and I do that all the time.

Overall, I feel very lucky to have gotten to see so much of the country this way, and that we have this service in America. We passed long stretches of empty land, and to have train tracks maintained so well that they can be used, even here, felt like a modern marvel. I can't say enough good things about the crew, and I've already recommended most of my friends try a trip like this.

Basically, ever since I've known him he has been very obese. It's difficult to guess exactly how much he weighs but I would say he's probably over 180kg so around 400lbs. Honestly, it may be more. 

He also received a cancer diagnosis 2-3 years ago, and it was thankfully only stage 2, so they caught it relatively early, removed the tumor, and he's okay now. That said, he hasn't really done too much about his weight issue in terms of lifestyle changes. He has gone on ozempic, but it doesn't seem to work. He has been on it for over a year and said quite openly that he ""eats through it"" and hasn't lost any weight with it, except that occasionally he'll feel nauseous.

He did some weight training as well, but stopped it because it made him hungrier. He refuses to try cardio, or even getting in daily steps. He also dines out almost every day and is super into fine dining and fancy food. Whenever he travels to Europe and sees me and our mutual friends, you can just see where the issue is.

He will pretty much only order things that are red meat, fried things, no vegetables. At a hotel breakfast, he'll only have waffles, sausage, and butter. No fruit, veg, even yoghurt, muesli or things that are remotely healthy. He'll eat potatoes but only when they're fried. He doesn't drink water, only diet soda, sugary Starbucks coffee and similar stuff. He doesn't eat fish, beans or tofu or lean chicken. Only red meat, preferably pork or fatty beef. Steak with butter. That type of stuff.

Recently, he opened up about his dating life issues to me, and I held myself back. A part of me wanted to tell him that women ghost him because he eats like he is 8 years old, and thinks veggies are gross. He likes to wine and dine girls, and is always chasing – sorry to say – very attractive women way out of his league, and I can just imagine them seeing him separate the veggies from his meal, and realize he has the diet of a child. 

I once discussed this with one of our mutual friends, and he pretty much told me not to raise the concerns because I am overweight myself. For reference, I am probably 140lbs but 5'2, so yes, maybe slightly overweight, but it doesn't impact my health. I exercise, eat my veggies, don't drink alcohol, etc. 

That said, I'm pretty sure that my friend would probably want to hear this from a friend; that's if he wants to change. I can imagine that the doctors have told him the same thing, though. So WIBTA if I talk to my friend that I am worried about him? Or should I just stay quiet?",1,1760280883.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

The Brita OB03 Standard Water Filter for pitchers and dispensers has become a staple in my daily routine. Filtered water is a must-have in our household, and with claims of reduced impurities like copper, cadmium, and mercury, it immediately piqued my interest. After about two months of usage, I feel ready to share the upsides, drawbacks, and personal insights about this product.

**User-Friendly Design and Easy Installation**

I’ll admit, ease of installation is one of the first selling points that got me interested. With absolutely no presoak required, getting the Brita filter up and running was a breeze. I simply opened the package, twisted it into place within my Brita water pitcher, and it was ready to go. The filter’s compatibility with various Brita models, including popular ones like the Grand, Slim, and Huron, adds to its appeal. For me, it fit perfectly in my Silver Slim Brita pitcher without any hiccups. That convenience saved me time and effort, which I appreciated during busy mornings when coffee cannot wait!  

[Check Brita OB03 Standard Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00008ihl8/)

**Taste and Impurity Elimination**

Filtered water shouldn’t just be clean—it should taste clean. Using the Brita filter, I noticed a significant difference in the taste of our tap water. Odd chlorinated flavors and smells disappeared completely. A mesh screen in the filter also ensures no black flecks in the water, which has been a recurring annoyance with other filters I’ve used. The product's ion-exchange resin and activated carbon do a commendable job of reducing heavy metals, as promised. While I can't personally test for reduced mercury or cadmium content, the taste, clarity, and smoothness of the water made me trust the filtration claims.

**Sustainability: A Big Bonus**

Something I really appreciate is the environmental impact—or rather lack thereof. With each filter replacing up to 300 plastic water bottles, it’s a comforting thought that we’re cutting down on waste as a family. Multiplying that over the year, especially with heavy usage during summer, makes this a more sustainable choice in the long run. Each filter's longevity—up to 40 gallons or around two months—feels just right, especially at the consumption level of our household.

**The Strengths**

- Compatible with a wide range of Brita products, making it versatile.
- No presoak necessary, simplifying setup.
- Effectively reduces chlorine taste and odor, along with heavy metals.
- Mesh screen eliminates black flecks for cleaner water.
- Provides a sustainable alternative, reducing plastic waste significantly.

**Weaknesses to Consider**

- The upfront cost of purchasing six filters as a pack might feel steep.
- While highly effective for taste and appearance, it doesn't filter out microbiological contaminants, so it’s not useful for untreated or unsafe water sources.
- Some users have noted slower filtering times after a month of use, which I’ve also noticed to a mild extent.

**Competing Products in the Market**

Filtration rivals like ZeroWater and PUR offer a tight contest. I’ve tried a ZeroWater pitcher before, and although its claim to filter out almost all dissolved solids is impressive, the taste wasn't as palatable as Brita’s filtered water. PUR, on the other hand, leans towards advanced filtration but with a bit of complexity, especially during the setup. The beauty of this Brita filter lies in its straightforward design and its long-standing reliability. Compared to these competitors, I’d say Brita wins hands down for ease of use and smooth maintenance experience. However, for those seeking filtration systems that also target microbiological dangers, more advanced models might edge it out.

**Smart Spending on Water Filtration**

Given the premium filtering capabilities and its lasting two months on average, this filter presents solid value for sustainable spending. Higher upfront filter purchase costs are justified, considering the reduction in bottled water dependency. Brita systems keep it cost-efficient in the long run, particularly for families like mine that go through gallons of water weekly. If you are hunting for a balance between affordability and effectiveness, this is a well-rounded option.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Housekeeping comes to the desk to complain about each other. Maintenance comes by with issues, expecting me to coordinate repairs and explain why things aren’t magically fixed yet. Then the manager walks in and starts venting about someone else.

Meanwhile, I’m standing there smiling like 🙂 while a guest tells me their whole life story because “you just look like a good listener.”

This year April I had my first constipation episode. I had blood in my stools. Went to my GP who told me to up my fibre and water intake which I did but made no difference. I was then constipated again and everytime I was I would bleed. I had a rectal examination and she said I might have a tiny internal hemmmie and prescribed me Magrocol/Miralax.
I did everything I could to get rid of this chronic constipation - 2x Kiwi, changing my diet, moving around, excersize, using a foot stool, improving my breathing, prune juice, psylium husk, magnesium glycinate and citrate, b-complex, slippery elm, coffee, herbal teas, apple cider vinegar, cayanne pepper in food. Everything. 
Whilst I did have some success with magnesium citrate and magrocol I don’t believe these are suitable long-term and I personally don’t want my bowels to become reliant on them at such a young age.
My stools currently are soft although it’s so unpredictable when I will be constipated as it happens overnight. I’m currently having fybogel and have started a carnivore diet, well I say carnivore but I do have some gluten free bread here and there. However, even though my stools are soft they are extremely hard to pass and I think after my countless constipation epsidoes I have an anal fissure or maybe 2 as they feel like theyre stretching from different areas. Every single bowel movement is like glass is coming out of me and it gives me so much anxiety that I am literally terrified to go to the toilet.
I’ve tried Anusol, sitz baths, castor oil, coconut oil, iodine, sudocrem, and vaseline but NOTHING works. I did a few stool tests and the lab told my GP to treat my condition as IBS-C.
I’m in the UK and I am on a waiting list to see a colorectal surgeon but I just feel so hopeless. Everytime I go to the toilet and can’t release I just cry lol. I just think back to the times I didn’t have this problem and how I took them times for granted. 
The worst thing is I have problems with my teeth and can’t consume a lot of sugar/acidic things as I have a clenching problem so most of my molars are just fractured. So even with natural cures that help other people, I can’t stay consistent with them because my teeth will literally fail:(

If anyone could give me some advice I would REALLY appreciate it. I’m honestly at my wits end with this whole situation. 😭❤️",1,1760280204.0,Constipation,2,1.0,False

Can’t believe it’s already been a year since we opened our doors here in Campbell.

From our very first client to the regulars who stop by every few weeks, this community has been incredible. Every conversation, every referral, and every smile has helped us grow more than we imagined.
I still remember our first client Austin from Vesper. 

We’re still a small, appointment-only barbershop — but every cut feels like a connection to the people who made this place feel like home. 

Thank you, Campbell, for the trust, support, and love this past year. Here’s to many more fades, laughs, and great conversations ahead. 💈❤️


Here’s a little thank-you gesture from us:
If you support any local business in Downtown Campbell — coffee shop, bakery, boutique, restaurant (mom and pop shops) — and spend $10 or more, we’ll add a $10 credit toward your next service with us. (Valid until the end of this month.)

1o4qtuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeAIStories/comments/1o4qtuv/the_apartment_above_mine/,The Apartment Above Mine,"I moved into my apartment about eight months ago. It’s a decent place, third floor of an older building in the city. Nothing fancy, but it’s affordable and the location is great. My landlord is this older guy named Mr. Chen who lives on the first floor. He’s pretty hands-off, which I appreciated. Just pay rent on time and don’t cause problems.

The thing is, there’s an apartment directly above mine. 4B. And for the entire eight months I’ve lived here, I’ve never seen anyone go in or out of it. Never heard footsteps. Never heard furniture moving or TV sounds or anything. Complete silence.

At first, I figured it was just vacant. Buildings have empty units all the time, right? But then I started noticing weird things.

About three months ago, I’m coming home from work around 6 PM. I’m walking up the stairs to the third floor and I smell cooking. Like, really strong cooking smells. Garlic, onions, something savory. It’s clearly coming from the fourth floor. I can see the smell is coming from under the door of 4B.

But here’s the thing—I never see anyone on the stairs. I never hear anyone coming or going. And the smell disappears within an hour. Like it was never there.

This starts happening maybe once or twice a week. Always around the same time. Always the same cooking smells. And always from 4B.

I ask my neighbor across the hall, this college student named Derek, if he’s ever seen anyone in 4B. He looks at me weird and says, “Dude, that apartment has been empty since before I moved in. Like, two years ago.”

So I go down to Mr. Chen’s apartment and knock on his door. He answers, looking annoyed that I’m bothering him.

“Mr. Chen, is someone living in 4B?”

He gets this strange expression. “Why do you ask?”

“I keep smelling cooking from up there. Like someone’s making dinner.”

He’s quiet for a long moment. Then he says, “No one lives there. Building code issue. Unit can’t be rented until it’s fixed.”

“But I smell—”

“Old building,” he interrupts. “Smells travel through the vents. Probably from 4A or one of the other units.”

But 4A is on the opposite side of the building. And the smell is definitely coming from directly above me.

Mr. Chen closes the door before I can ask anything else.

That night, I’m lying in bed around 11 PM when I hear it. Footsteps. Clear as day. Someone walking around in 4B. Slow, deliberate steps. Back and forth. Like someone pacing.

I grab my phone and record it. The footsteps continue for about five minutes, then stop.

The next morning, I play the recording for Derek. He listens and his face goes pale.

“That’s really weird, man,” he says. “I’ve literally never heard anything from up there.”

“You’re on the third floor too. You’re right below 4A. You’ve never heard anything from the fourth floor at all?”

“Never. Not once.”

I decide I need to see inside 4B. I know it’s probably trespassing or whatever, but this is driving me crazy. That evening, I wait until I see Mr. Chen leave the building. He does the same thing every Thursday—leaves around 7 PM, probably going to dinner or something.

I go up to the fourth floor. The hallway is dimmer than the other floors. One of the lights is out. I walk up to 4B and try the door handle.

It’s unlocked.

My heart is pounding as I push the door open. It creaks loudly. The apartment is dark. I pull out my phone and turn on the flashlight.

The place is fully furnished. There’s a couch, a coffee table, a TV. Kitchen has dishes in the drying rack. There’s a calendar on the wall. But everything is covered in dust. Thick dust. Like no one has been here in years.

I walk through the apartment. There’s a bedroom with a made bed. Dust on the blankets. A bathroom with towels hanging on the rack. Also covered in dust.

But in the kitchen, on the stove, there’s a pot. I walk over to it and look inside.

There’s food in it. Fresh food. Vegetables in some kind of broth. Still warm. Steam rising from it.

I don’t touch it. I back away from the stove and that’s when I notice the calendar on the wall. It’s open to August 2019. Six years ago.

Every single day has a checkmark on it. Little pencil marks. Like someone was crossing off days. But it stops on August 23rd. That date is circled in red. No checkmark.

I’m standing there staring at the calendar when I hear the front door close behind me.

I spin around. No one is there. But the door is definitely closed now. I know I left it open.

“Hello?” My voice cracks.

No response. But I hear something. Water running. It’s coming from the bathroom.

I should leave. Every instinct is telling me to run. But I can’t help myself. I walk slowly toward the bathroom. The door is closed. I can see light coming from under it. The water is definitely running. The sink, I think.

I reach for the door handle. My hand is shaking. I turn it and push the door open.

The sink is running. Full blast. But no one is there. The bathroom is empty.

I turn off the water. My hands won’t stop shaking. In the mirror, I see something that makes my blood run cold.

There’s writing. In the condensation on the mirror. Fresh writing.

It says: “AUGUST 23RD.”

That’s it. Just those words.

I run. I don’t close the door behind me. I just run down to the third floor and lock myself in my apartment.

I don’t sleep that night. I keep hearing footsteps above me. Pacing. Back and forth. All night long.

The next morning, I’m exhausted. I decide I need to know what happened in that apartment. I go to the public library and use their computer to search old news articles. I search for the address of my building plus “August 2019.”

I find it on the third page of results.

“Man Missing After Apartment Fire - Foul Play Suspected”

I click the article. There’s a photo of my building. Smoke damage on the fourth floor. The article says that on August 23rd, 2019, there was a fire in apartment 4B. A man named David Chen lived there. He was Mr. Chen’s son.

The fire was small, contained to the kitchen. But David Chen was never found. Not in the apartment, not in the building. He just vanished. The article says police investigated whether he started the fire himself to fake his own death, but they found no evidence. No body. No trace of where he went.

The case went cold.

I read the article three times. David Chen. Mr. Chen’s son. He disappeared six years ago from the apartment directly above mine.

That evening, I see Mr. Chen coming back into the building. I stop him in the lobby.

“Mr. Chen, I need to ask you about your son.”

His face goes hard. “I don’t have a son.”

“David Chen. He lived in 4B. He disappeared in 2019.”

“You need to mind your own business,” he says quietly. But his voice is shaking.

“I went inside the apartment. There’s fresh food on the stove. Someone wrote on the bathroom mirror.”

He grabs my arm. His grip is surprisingly strong for an old man. “You went inside?”

“The door was unlocked. I just wanted to—”

“You shouldn’t have done that,” he says. “You need to stay away from that apartment. Don’t go back up there. Not at night. Not ever.”

“Why? What happened to your son?”

His eyes are watering. “My son made a mistake. He did something he shouldn’t have. And now he’s paying for it.”

“What does that mean? Is he alive?”

“I don’t know,” Mr. Chen says. And he sounds like he’s telling the truth. “I don’t know if he’s alive or dead or something else. All I know is that he’s in that apartment. He’s been in that apartment for six years. And he can’t leave.”

“That’s impossible.”

“You smelled the cooking. You heard the footsteps. You saw the writing on the mirror. You tell me what’s impossible.”

He lets go of my arm and walks to his apartment. Before he closes the door, he looks back at me.

“The only advice I can give you is this: Don’t be in your apartment on August 23rd. Not this year. That’s in two weeks. Whatever you do, don’t be home that night.”

“Why? What happens on August 23rd?”

“I don’t know. But every year on that date, I hear things from 4B. Terrible things. Screaming. Crashing. Like the fire is happening all over again. And in the morning, there’s always water damage in the units below. Water from the sprinkler system in 4B. But when I check the apartment, everything is dry. Nothing is damaged. It’s like it happened in another version of the building.”

“Does anyone else hear it?”

“The people in 3B used to. The apartment directly below. But no one stays there long. They always move out. That’s why the rent is so cheap for your unit.”

My unit. 3B. I’m in 3B.

“You put me in the apartment right below your son?”

“I needed someone there,” he says. “The building inspector won’t close the file unless there’s no noise complaints. If the apartment below is occupied and no one complains about 4B, I can keep the case quiet.”

“You’re using me as proof that nothing is wrong?”

“I’m sorry,” he says. And he actually sounds sorry. “But my son is trapped. I don’t know how or why, but he’s been trapped in that apartment for six years. And I don’t know how to help him. The only thing I can do is keep people away.”

He closes the door.

I stand there in the lobby for a long time. Then I go back up to my apartment.

That night, I hear the footsteps again. Pacing. Back and forth. And I swear I hear something else. A voice. Faint. Coming from above.

It sounds like it’s saying “help me.”

Over and over.

“Help me.”

I have two weeks until August 23rd. Two weeks to figure out what happened to David Chen. Two weeks to decide if I’m going to stay or run.

But here’s the thing that keeps me up at night: Every time I hear those footsteps, every time I hear that voice, I wonder if David Chen knows he’s been trapped for six years. Or if, to him, it’s still August 23rd, 2019. Still the day of the fire. Still the day he disappeared.

If he’s living the same day over and over again, not knowing that six years have passed.

And I wonder if, on August 23rd of this year, I’m going to find out exactly what he’s been going through.

I still haven’t decided if I’m going to be here to find out.",1,1760280132.0,FakeAIStories,0,1.0,False

I've just finished putting together some shorter lengths of wattle fencing, some lengths with a gate/opening, and a muddy paddock/ big for them to go around. 

Tried a couple of different things: 

- I used dried coffee grounds for 'gravel' texture, which has turned out nicely.
- once I'd glued the 'wattle' jute string into place, and having let the glue dry completely, I ran a lighter flame over the fence, which removed some of the fluffy bits. Send to make them appear a little more 'twiggy'. Heh!

The compact size of this little 4oz bottle is actually one of its best traits. It’s small enough to tuck into a purse or stash under the sink without taking up much space. The spray nozzle, which is surprisingly sturdy for a smaller product, delivers just the right amount of remover without drenching the fabric. I’ve used a lot of cleaning products that overdo it on the spray, but this one keeps it efficient. The transparent design of the bottle is a nice touch too, as you can easily see how much product you have left.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
This stain remover doesn’t mess around. I tested it on a variety of disasters – a splash of coffee on my favorite white shirt, mud dragged onto the couch by my dog, and even an old stain from grape juice that I’d all but given up on. Spray, blot, and a quick wash later, nearly every stain disappeared like magic. Grass stains on my kids’ play clothes and grease from cooking were no match either. It also seems to work on deeper set-in messes, which most cleaners I’ve tried just can't handle.

**Quick Emergency Use**  
Its fast-acting formula is probably my favorite feature. I’ve had moments where I knocked over a glass of red wine on the sofa (don’t ask), and this saved the day every single time. Just a quick spray and blot, and you can almost watch the stain lift off the fabric. The ease of use is phenomenal – no elbow grease needed, though old stains might require a couple of treatments to fully disappear.

**Strengths**  
- Certified by the EPA Safer Choice program, which gives peace of mind when using it around kids and pets.  
- Tackles everything from fresh spills to old, set-in stains.  
- The compact, easy-to-use spray makes it incredibly convenient for those unpredictable moments.

**Caveats to Consider**  
For all its power, there are a few areas where the product has room to improve.  
- While it handles most stains well, I noticed it did struggle a bit with ink stains. They faded but didn’t vanish entirely.  
- The bottle’s size means it’ll run out quickly if you’re dealing with bigger messes or using it daily.  
- Certain delicate fabrics might not fare well, which is noted on the label. Testing on a small, inconspicuous area is a must.

**Other Options**  
Compared to competitors like Shout or OxiClean, this remover holds its own remarkably well. While Shout is great for general stain lifting, I find it lacks the quick response that a spray-on like this one offers. OxiClean, on the other hand, demands more prep and soaking, which isn’t ideal when you're dealing with spur-of-the-moment accidents. This could be considered more user-friendly for instantaneous results.

**Financial Value**  
For such a small bottle packed with so many benefits, the price seemed fair to me. With its versatility and efficiency, it ended up replacing several other products I used to rely on, saving me both time and effort. Although I wish there was a version with more volume for heavy-duty use, this compact design pays for itself in convenience.

A Detailed Report On My Week In Lahore, Pakistan","tl;dr Lahore is basically safe, cheap, with lots of amazing food and sights, but you need to be careful, especially when flying out of the country. No apologies for what is an extremely long post.

**Background**

I was born in Lahore, Pakistan and spent a significant part of my childhood there. I recently visited Lahore for the first time since I left decades ago with my wife who is not of Pakistani origin.

We spent five full days in Lahore, with a long day of travel on both ends, including layovers. We applied for free e-visas via the Nadra website ([https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/)) and got them in about 24 hours. I planned this trip once before and applied for an e-visa back then as well. That application included a lot of personal questions like my religion, but the application process has been simplified in the last 1-2 years.

I would strongly recommend bringing a printed copy of the visa grant notice you get from Nadra as I needed this in a surprising number of places beyond immigration when entering Pakistan, including my hotel, currency exchange shop and even checking in for my flight leaving the country. My passport with an entry stamp seemed to be of little interest.

**Things To Know**

Some general points that might help orient your trip:

* Pakistan is not just a developing country, but it’s also, in my opinion, a country in decline. This means that the quality of the people is great but the quality of institutions, systems and infrastructure is not. 
* It’s cheaper to rent a car with a driver than to drive that car yourself. My hotel, one of the nicest in Pakistan, didn’t have an iron in the room but ironed shirts for about $1 US and could dry clean them for about $2-3 US.
* Pakistan is an isolated country internationally for the size of its population and its diaspora. There are only about 30-40 international flights a day into Lahore, a city of more than 10 million. For a long time, no one wanted to visit and no one wanted to do business here and this is reflected in the quality and availability of products and services.
* There is a significant security presence around the city, particularly anywhere you would go as a visitor. At one point, I noticed that my hotel as well as the eight buildings to its left, all had at least one armed guard standing outside.
* You will spend a lot of your time thinking about clean water, clean toilets and how to safely get from one place to the next. You can’t really just walk around, even in the nicest of neighbourhoods, because sidewalks are messy or nonexistent and there are few traffic lights or crosswalks.
* Protests broke out in Lahore just as we left which closed all schools, the metro and lots of major roads in the western and central parts of the city. If we had been near the old city at the time, it would have been absolute chaos trying to get across town. This is where having an insurance policy, whether it's a friend, a relative, a nice hotel or even a hired driver, can really make a difference.

**Arrival**

The airport terminal was clean but old, including the bathroom before immigration. Clearing immigration took a few minutes and all I needed was my passport and printed visa confirmation. For those who are nervous, they didn't check anything else and don’t ask any questions. There are a confusing set of lines here, divided into a few for Pakistani citizens, one for overseas Pakistanis, one for foreigners, one for Chinese passport holders and one or two just for women.

The wait for bags was probably about five minutes but the crowd around the carousel was huge. All baggage must be x-rayed before leaving. This entire process took about a half hour and we forgot to exchange currency in our rush to get out of the airport. We had arranged a driver from the hotel who was waiting outside the door with my name on a sign. Walking into the waiting area was like a scene from a movie and I wish I had taken a picture of it. There were probably 1,000 people of all ages standing outside.

We paid PKR 3,500 (about $15 US) for the driver to pick us up and while you could probably make this trip for 500-600 rupees, I think this was money well-spent. Just about every international flight to Lahore arrives between 8 pm and 4 am. I can’t imagine trying to use one of the local rideshare apps for the first time in a crowded place like this airport. I would strongly recommend arranging for your hotel or hostel to pick you up.

Just before we got into the crowd, an armed police officer stopped me and asked to see my wife’s passport. He looked at it and handed it back without a word. It seemed more like it was for her protection than it was out of suspicion, and it happened four more times during our five-day trip. From the conversations I had with police and security guards, who often directly asked me to confirm that my wife wasn’t Chinese, it appears there is a requirement for Chinese citizens to travel around the city with their own security detail. My wife is not Chinese but can pass for Chinese.

**Hotel**

We stayed at the Nishat Hotel in Gulberg, in the southern part of Lahore, for about $250 US per night. Our primary concern was security, followed by cleanliness. We also considered the Pearl Continental and the Avari, both closer to the city centre, but decided on the Nishat because the rooms looked nicer and the Gulberg area has more in terms of nice restaurants and cafes. After having been there, the Ramada in Gulberg looked nice, with lots of restaurants in close proximity.

The Nishat was very secure with great staff. We were upgraded to a studio suite and got a fruit basket every day that we enjoyed. The Pakistani cricket team was staying in this hotel at the same time as us. We saw both coaches and players in the lobby, the restaurant and the gym, which incidentally is quite good.

**Getting Around**

Lahore doesn’t really have much in the way of public transportation except for buses, including a couple of bus-only roads that appear on Google as a metro, as well as an actual subway line. One downside of staying in Gulberg is that you’ll be far from both the bus metro and the actual metro.

Uber and Careem, which often get mentioned in guides or blog posts, are no longer available in Pakistan. There are a few local options like InDrive or Yango. I chose InDrive based on reading people’s opinions on r/Pakistan or r/Lahore. I took 29 rides with InDrive over five days and had only good experiences. The worst thing that happened was that a couple of the drivers had really strong body odour.

InDrive is extremely cheap, about 300-1,000 PKR to go from Gulberg across town to the Lahore Fort depending on what option you choose. We usually chose the most expensive option, a sedan with AC, but there are options for rickshaws, motorcycles and smaller cars as well. Over the last couple of days I used the second-most expensive option as the cars were cleaner. With this option, the cost was 200 rupees within Gulberg and 500 rupees to go to Model Town.

Drivers will regularly want your phone number and call you both when they accept your ride and once they arrive. However, the call quality on the app is horrendous in the best of situations and worse in a crowded place. If you can’t at least text in romanized Urdu (eg “mein gate ke samne hoon”), I’m not quite sure how easy it would be to use this. Drivers were apathetic at worst and super helpful at their best. About 5-6 asked if I wanted to hire them as a driver. One asked me to cancel the ride to help him save about 80 rupees in tax, which tells you a bit about what it’s like to live in Pakistan.

People drive both slowly (seldom above 50 km/h) and aggressively and you will come within inches of hitting another vehicle on a regular basis. You will also regularly see carts pulled by horses and donkeys, to the point that it stops being a novelty. I was in two small accidents during my time there, one where our car cut off a motorcycle on our left but a rickshaw tried to squeeze through and hit our car, as well as two motorcycles to the left of the rickshaw. Another time, our driver went the wrong way down a tight alleyway, reversed for about 600 metres and then hit a motorcycle that was clearly visible in the rear camera.

**Day 1**

We used day 1 as a sort of warmup to get our feet wet. Since we forgot to exchange money at the airport, we exchanged money at the hotel. To their credit, they told us that they charge a 5% fee and gave us detailed directions to the best places for currency exchange. However, taking a car there required cash we didn’t have, so we just exchanged $100 at the hotel. Note that most places will only change $100 US notes, though other currencies might be different. 

We went out for coffee to Brew Bar, where the coffees and almond croissant (1900 rupees) were better than what we got at the hotel breakfast. From there, we went to the Emporium Mall (900 PKR) for sightseeing, shopping and lunch. The mall was quite large and a sign of the growing middle class in Pakistan. I liked seeing people take family pictures or selfies because the mall was a destination for them.

We had lunch at the Platter Express in the food court, where one of the smaller Pakistani food platters, a small pizza and a large Coke cost about 1,800 rupees. After that we bought a mango from the Carrefour for 300 rupees, which was both delicious and also the only mango we had during our trip as they seemed to disappear from fruit stands and Carrefours afterwards.

We relaxed at the hotel in the afternoon and went for dinner at the Chinese restaurant in the Avari. The service was great and the food was quite good but expensive. We paid about 7,500 rupees for a soup, chicken wings, Szechuan chicken and fried rice. The hotel itself was almost empty. We were the only people in the restaurant for most of our meal, I saw only a few people in the Pakistani restaurant across the hall, and the lobby was fairly empty as well. The hotel looked old and a bit faded, but I like the service, the atmosphere and the location.

**Day 2**

This was the best day of our trip. We went to the Lahore Fort in the morning, getting off on Fort Road directly south of Hazuri Bagh (we put Alamgiri Gate into InDrive). There is no signage, but a gate and security guards at Fort Road. Don’t be afraid to ask a security guard if you’re unsure.

The Alamgiri Gate, which you often see in pictures and images of Lahore, is even more amazing in person with a Pakistani flag on top. If you are facing the gate, the entrance to the Lahore Fort is around the corner on your left. Entrance was 1,000 rupees per person for foreigners and 100 for locals. I thought I could charm my way into paying the 100 rupees, but they charged us both 1,000 each.

We spent more time here than we anticipated, about two hours. Our favourite part was the Sheesh Mahal, but the picture wall, the elephant steps and sitting under a huge tea for tea near Moti Mosque were also highlights. The fort is sadly not very well-preserved, particularly in the northern and eastern parts near Masti Gate, which is cool in a way because you feel the history more, but also sad to see considering what it was once like. There is also a tremendous amount of graffiti in some older structures near Shah Jahan’s quadrangle.

When leaving, we ended up going back out a different way through Greater Iqbal Park to Circular Road. This is one of the busiest, most crowded parts of Lahore and trying to get an InDrive to come to this spot was very hard. Try not to exit this way unless you have a driver waiting for you.

We actually went back to the hotel for a few hours and came back in the evening because we wanted to see Badshahi Masjid at sunset. This was the highlight of our trip. If you’re taking an InDrive, just put the Alamgiri Gate as your location as the Badshahi Masjid is across from the Lahore Fort. Our driver let us on a side street at the northeast corner of the mosque. Some guy sitting on a chair in a park led us across the back of the mosque and we came in a side entrance near the prayer area.

The mosque is stunning at dusk for its beauty and its size. It was my favourite place in Lahore as a child and it seemed even more impressive all these years later, compared with both my memories and pictures you see online. People of all types come there to sightsee, hang out, pray or even rest. We arrived at 5 pm and heard the call to prayer and watched the maghrib prayer around 5:50 pm, which was really cool. It was dark just after 6 and most people had left. 

We had dinner nearby at Haveli, which has a rooftop with views of the mosque. This was my favourite meal of our trip. We paid about 6,000 rupees for a handi and kebab platter with naan, drinks and a salad. One nice touch they have is a handwash basin they bring to your table before and after your meal. They also have live music, which you may like or hate depending on your taste.

A traditional qawwali performance was starting on the second floor as we left, but the group they were performing for hadn’t arrived yet, so the singers invited us to sit, which we did for just about two minutes. I had been hoping to see some qawwali, but a personal concert for two, in this location, was more than I could have imagined.

Haveli is on the Fort Road Food Street, which is made for tourists, with lots of great restaurants and cafes. We sat and had tea on the street afterwards at Chai Ishq . I’m not sure if it’s the name of the cafe or just the worker I saw, but they served each cup of tea with a poem, which was cool to see. This was a great opportunity to people watch and while we probably saw 10-15 tourists, most were locals of all types.

We walked out a few minutes early waiting for our car, probably around 9 pm, and we were soon surrounded by four people asking for money: an old woman selling toys, a child, a trans woman and an old man in religious attire. The security guards helped us a bit in getting the car to our location and giving us space while getting in.

**Day 3**

I went to Data Darbar and the walled city of Lahore by myself in the morning. I didn’t think my wife would enjoy it and I also didn’t think it would be a pleasant experience for her. The walled city is just south of the Lahore Fort and Data Darbar, a Sufi shrine that’s about 1,000 years old, is just west of the walled city.

Data Darbar is at probably the dirtiest, most crowded and dodgiest intersection I have seen in Lahore. The shrine is right on the street and I was swarmed by people asking me for donations along with other things I couldn’t quite understand, before going through security. Inside you’ll see people praying, chatting, sleeping and even singing. I stopped to watch one singer for a few minutes and gave him 100 rupees.

Data Darbar was meaningful to me because in many ways, it represents the soul of Lahore to me, especially historically. The city and the country might be going in a different direction now, but the culture, the dancing and the music associated with Data Darbar are all things I value.

I then crossed the street twice, since Data Darbar is at sort of a three-way intersection, to get to the walled city. This was not at all easy and I tucked myself in behind others trying to cross the road.

The southwest corner of the walled city, near Bhatti gate, was an absolute, muddy mess of garbage, smoke from rickshaws, people lying on the ground and animals. In general, the walled city is much more developed in the north and the east, but has less to see in the southwest where I started. I saw shops selling pigeons, people bathing on the street, children leading donkeys carrying cement and people sorting garbage in tiny shops. Lots of kids were playing in the streets, or working, on a Wednesday morning.

As I walked, I started to see heritage sites such as havelis, plus tiny restaurants, shops and mosques that must have been 200-300 years old. Probably the most interesting spot was an intersection with two restaurants, a fruit stand and a barber who works outdoors next to the fruit stand. I didn’t see a single other tourist in two hours and often felt self-conscious about taking pictures since the streets are so narrow. 

I walked all the way across the walled city to the Delhi gate, which is the most touristy part not counting the fort itself. It was very interesting, but also dirty, loud and chaotic. Still, nothing bad happened to me. Only a few people spoke to me, and they all thought I was a local. The Delhi gate is chaotic to put it mildly and you’ll want to have a clear plan for how to get out. The InDrive car I got wanted an extra 500 rupees for coming to this part of town and I gladly paid. Even so, it was hard to find the car, so if you’re not confident in your spoken Urdu or your Lahori street smarts, I would encourage you to get a guide and/or a driver.

We came back to the Badshahi Masjid again at sunset because I loved it that much. On our way out, the people keeping shoes kept asking for more money, without specifying an amount. We had a snack near the mosque on the food street and on our way out, the security guard at the gate asked me for money (“sir, chai pila dein”). The same child beggar from the previous day tried to open our car door for us in hopes of money.

We had dinner at Ambarsariya in Gulberg and when we got out, an old man selling shoe inserts approached us for money and laid on a very strong guilt, telling us how he was now dependent on others but wished that it never happened to my parents, that he wished only the best for my parents, that he was sure I was a good son. My heart absolutely broke listening to this, but I was emotionally exhausted after less than 72 hours in the city.

We stopped at a dessert place (Bundu Khan) 100 metres from our hotel and on the walk back, a woman chased us almost the entire way, asking for money, telling us that her kid had to eat, that the poor also deserved to eat, that I should be more generous since I had so much money.

**Day 4**

Our plans for the last two days was to take it easier after two days in the old city. I ran in the morning at Bagh-e-Jinnah. It’s quite a big space and one full loop of the park is around 2.5 kilometres, with a dedicated jogging path that’s a 1.8-kilometre dirt loop. I ended up holding my phone in my hand, but it was no different than running anywhere else in the world. The park itself is quite nice, with lots of gardens, a library, little food stands and playgrounds. 

We went out for breakfast at Cafe Aylanto, where we had French toast and pancakes (6,000 rupees). This was one of the nicest places, period, I saw in Lahore and we actually ate here four times during our trip. From there we went shopping at Packages Mall and bought quite a few books at the Liberty Books there. We had a small lunch here at the Tawa Chatkhara.

In the evening, we went for a walk around Bagh-e-Jinnah and decided to walk the 500 metres to dinner at the Pearl Continental hotel. This is probably the longest we walked on the streets here and while this part of Mall Road is pleasant, it turned into a mess because although the intersection east of Bagh-e-Jinnah has a crosswalk, you still have to cross through left-turning cars to get there and you can’t see those cars from the crosswalk. Once we made it across, we ran into a police roadblock that had closed the street in front of the hotel. They were quite rude to me until the senior officer in charge saw my wife, asked for both our passports and let us through when he saw that we were from wealthy countries.

The Pearl Continental looked about the same as it did when I was a kid. It was under extraordinary security, but was also far, far busier than the Avari, which is just down the street. The lobby had been renovated, however, and there was a huge crowd of international business people chatting under massive chandeliers. Dinner at Marco Polo was forgettable and what looked to be most of the South African cricket team next to us had a similarly difficult time getting someone to take their order.

We went up to the Rumours sports bar, which is one of a handful of legal bars in Pakistan. Lots of posts online vaguely allude to this as a secret place you have to ask about, but it’s in plain sight as a repurposed guest room with a sign on the door. Simply take the elevator to the second floor, go straight and it’s the first room on your right, number 242. There was a weird dance about supposedly only serving foreigners who are also staying at the hotel and them repeatedly asking for the name of the hotel we were staying. We brought our passports but they just asked for our citizenships and left it there.

One Murree lager cost 1,600 rupees and it was an okay beer, but I would have preferred to drink it someplace other than that bar given that it was smoky and tense. A number of places in Lahore also legally sell alcohol to foreigners and I would have preferred to do that.

**Day 5**

On our last day in Lahore, I got up early to run at Model Town Park. I grew up in this area and went to this park often as a kid, but none of it looked familiar all these years later. It was another pretty good place to run, with a dirt 2.2-kilometre loop that is probably close to being a perfect circle. The park has a few small shops, lots of grass, and an entrance lined with palm trees and a huge Pakistani flag. Again, it was we went for breakfast again at the Cafe Aylanto, followed by a trip back to Model Town to see my childhood house which looked basically the same after all these years. From there we went on to Emporium Mall to do a bit of shopping for gifts, followed by samosa chaat for lunch in the food court.

We did our packing in the afternoon and had dinner nearby our hotel at Mystique. I went to Bundu Khan for one last dessert and the badam halwa was so good that I stopped eating because I didn’t think anything else I ate could top it. 

**Departure**

Everything about leaving this country was an absolute nightmare. We got to the airport a little over three hours before our flight. When we finally got through the narrow entrance that was lined with hundreds of people, the guard wouldn’t let us into the terminal, simply saying that checkin for our flight was not open but refused to say when checkin might open. Honestly, it  felt like he wanted a bribe. We tried an adjacent entrance where the guard let us in without a hassle, but this still gives me nightmares.  
We passed through a security check to get into the terminal, but the female guards who frisked my wife decided there was something suspicious about her suitcase. They opened it and went through its contents in their entirety, asking lots of questions that seemed motivated mostly by personal curiosity, before giving up after about 5-7 minutes. They couldn’t explain in English or in Urdu what they were looking for.

Our airline’s checkin counter was open and there was no line. The agent asked us both for our visas. From there, it was off to the passport control, which had long, slow-moving lines for Chinese passport holders, foreigners and Pakistani passport holders. Someone offered to get us through the line quickly in exchange for money but wouldn’t say how much. I offered the 1,000 rupees left in my wallet and he laughed, but suggested the line for Chinese passport holders was faster. We stood in that line, where probably 90% of the people weren’t Chinese, and got through after a half hour minutes.

The security check was pretty quick if chaotic and halfhearted. The agents flagged the man in front of me for having medication, and he explained that it was thyroid medication for which he had a prescription as well as a doctor’s note. He was still there after I had gotten my stuff back together and walked away. It took us about 90 minutes to from start to finish to get through security, with two overt and one subtle requests for bribes in that time.

The shops after security are pretty basic, but there’s actually a pretty good food court if you turn left and go up the escalators after passing security. The boarding procedure was decent, although no one checked my wife’s passport before boarding. I enjoyed my trip immensely, but I was very, very relieved to get on the plane.

As a final insult, when I got home, I saw that my suitcase had been opened, the compartments unzipped and someone had gone through the contents in their entirety.. Nothing was stolen and I was glad that they touched the sweaty running clothes I left on top.

**Dressing As A Foreigner And A Woman**

Lots of people are curious about this, especially for women. My wife noticed the intense staring from the gate where we boarded our flight to Lahore. It continued, in nice places and not-so-nice places. Another thing she noticed was how few women there were in public places and how many men there were in shops, hotels or tourist attractions, often just hanging out with nothing to do but stare at her. No one spoke to her, even when they needed to, instead speaking to her through me. No one asked any questions or said anything in appropriate. A couple of women asked to take selfies with her, which she said yes to.

In terms of dressing, I suggested that she cover up in the older part of town near the Lahore Fort but not in Gulberg near our hotel or in any mosques. We saw plenty of Pakistani women without their heads covered, even at Badshahi Masjid, but she said in general covering her head made her stand out less than she would otherwise. 

We both tried to dress down and wore long pants with button down shirts, but even if people couldn’t necessarily tell that I was from overseas, they could definitely tell that I had money. I don’t think there’s anything I could’ve done about that.

**Money**

We went to very nice places to eat and took the most expensive option on InDrive, which takes either cash or domestic payment options we couldn’t use. All in all, we exchanged $200 US for about 57,000 rupees and had about 5,000 left at the end of our trip. We spent around 80,000 rupees in five days on credit cards for meals and shopping. I recognize that this is probably at the upper limit of what most people would spend. 

We kept our money and phones in small crossbody bags. I only felt unsafe in some areas around Data Darbar and some parts of the walled city. Otherwise, it was basically business as usual. I used a travel wallet where I kept only notes of 100 rupees and smaller, with larger notes of 500 or 1,000 in a separate place.

I noticed most places in Emporium at least had very consistent exchange rates that were almost identical to what you'd see on Google.

**People**

I loved the people. So many people went out of their way to help me in different ways when they didn’t have to, in big ways and small. I thought people were friendly, warm if a bit excessively deferential in service settings. But I thought so many people I met would have done anything for us, which was really touching throughout the trip.

If there is a negative, I often saw that people wouldn't make suggestions or decisions for themselves, just throwing it back to me. For example, if I asked a driver to take me to the closest gate of a park with multiple entrances, they would just repeat that they would take me anywhere I wanted. Or, if a dish was late to the point of being forgotten, as it happened just about every time we ate out, and I asked if it could be canceled, they would say that it was almost ready but that it could be canceled, because they would do whatever I wanted. Even people trying to hustle me into paying them to be a tour guide, pay extra for storing my shoes or bribing my way through a security line wouldn't name a price, but say I could pay whatever I wanted.

**Final Thoughts**

This was home for me. It felt surreal to come back and realize that I was born there, and grew up there. I have lived and traveled around the world, constantly explaining my background to people. It was amazing to go to a place where I didn’t have to explain anything but I could just be. I loved speaking Urdu, I loved people assuming I was from there and I loved learning about my heritage. 

There were so many things I hated. I hated the traffic, the air quality (the AQI was around 150-250 in early October), the poverty, the lack of security and the way people often tried to squeeze a few dollars out of me in alternatively vague or aggressive ways.

I’m planning a 1-year French study plan to aim for NCLC 7.

First 8 months:

* Focus on grammar, vocab, listening, reading, spelling, and speaking.
* Using Pimsleur for listening, Learn French with Alexa for grammar/vocab, and Coffee Break French, YouTube, and easy French blogs for extra input.
* Also adding French music (recently found the French version of Last Christmas 😅).
* ChatGPT for writing practice and feedback,
* Planning 1–2 italki sessions per week for speaking practice.

Last 4 months:

* Increase to 3 italki sessions/week, daily self-speaking, and full TEF prep.

Does this sound like a realistic plan to reach NCLC 7 in a year? Would love feedback from anyone who’s done TEF or hit that level recently.

I'm a 47F, recently single after a long-term thing fizzled out, and my friend swore this guy was ""perfect"" – funny, kind, loves hiking. We met at a cozy coffee shop downtown, and things started off normal: small talk about jobs (I'm in marketing, he's a teacher), favorite shows (we both binge The Office), and that classic ""what's your go-to guilty pleasure food?"" (Mine's late-night tacos, obviously).
About 20 minutes in, he leans in and says, ""Okay, real talk – why are you single? You're way too cool for that."" I laugh it off at first, but he presses gently, like he's genuinely curious. Before I know it, I'm spilling my guts about how my ex was great on paper but emotionally checked out, how I spent a year questioning if I was ""too much"" for wanting more adventure in life. He's nodding, sharing his own story about a breakup that left him ghosting dates because he was scared of vulnerability. It felt... cathartic? Like we were two strangers accidentally starting group therapy over lattes.
Then, the twist: As we're wrapping up (it's been two hours, and the barista is giving us side-eye for hogging the corner table), he grins and says, ""You know, this was supposed to be a date, but if I can be honest... you're the first person in ages who's made me want to skip the small talk next time. Coffee again? Or should we make it tacos and no ex-talk?"" I paused, heart doing that flippy thing, and replied, ""Tacos. But only if you promise to share your worst karaoke song story first.""
We exchanged numbers, and as I walked home, I realized: Sometimes the best connections start with the messiest conversations. Anyone else had a date turn into an accidental heart-to-heart? What's your ""date gone right but weird"" story?

Some everyday foods secretly sabotage your progress. From “healthy” snack bars to your morning coffee, these culprits are loaded with hidden sugars, refined carbs, and unhealthy fats that trigger cravings and fat storage. 

Knowing what to avoid can help you reach your goals faster and feel your best!

Main Points:

White Bread: Packed with refined flour that spikes blood sugar and causes cravings.

Soda & Sweetened Drinks: Full of empty calories and sugar that turn directly into fat.

Pastries & Baked Goods: High in sugar and trans fats that slow metabolism.

Processed Snack Bars: Marketed as healthy but often loaded with artificial ingredients.

Fried Fast Foods: Contain unhealthy oils and calories that lead to belly fat.

Sugary Coffee Drinks: Hidden sugar bombs disguised as energy boosters.

I am a 44M, divorced for about 8 months after a 15 year marriage. I've dated a bit, had a 6mo relationship. For the past year or so, I've platonically re-connected with a neighbor (47F) that I have known for almost 20 years, let's call her Arlene. 

Arlene and I have some overlapping friends, she is part of a friend group that includes the wife of my college roommate. In our younger days, we were at parties together. I always noticed she was cute. Later on, my ex and I bought a house that turned out to be around the corner from her and we were couple friends. That fell off as her marriage fell apart 8 years ago after having a kid, meanwhile I had my own kid and the pandemic and we sort of lost touch. Arlene is a fairly socially anxious person, to the point that I recall my ex- dismissively commenting on that anxiety, but it never really bothered me.  
   
When I was starting my divorce last year, I re-kindled the connection. We have a lot in common and we've done friendly, active things together: sauna visits, walks for coffee, biking, and the occasional text about life/parenting/neighborhood stuff. We've opened up to each other about divorced life and our experiences dating, what we want in a relationship, but never broached the subject of dating each other. 

There haven't been any direct signs of romantic interest between us, e.g. no arm touching or locked gazes or things like that. I know I've been fairly guarded, because I actually really like her. I imagine she is fairly guarded as well, because she's had a rough go of romantic relationships and, from what she's told me, feels a bit stuck at 47 and a mostly full-time parent. 

My plan is to ask her to walk to coffee during the workday (we both WFH) in a couple weeks and float the idea of us having more than a friendship. I do like her as a friend, too--she's my most active friend--and would be sad to make that weird if she wasn't interested.

I even attended a few cupping sessions to improve my palette, but still miss the mark since the notes come off muddled to me. That was until last September, when my workmate from Indonesia introduced me to Giyanti.

Not sure if it stems more from my lack of exposure to high quality beans, but I got to pick up the richness, vibrance, and aroma of the blend before I even took a sip! I’ve never had such clarity and experienced a surprise in a cup. So now, I am more excited than ever when I make my daily brew, until they run out lol. My fave from the 2 is the house blend.

Anyway, I just wanted to share it here with more enthusiasts. I’d love to hear from others what their favorite beans are and if they can be bought here in PH so I can continue my journey.

PS: I am going to Indonesia on Nov 15 and I plan to go to Giyanti to get some more beans. I looked them up and they’re this low key coffee roaster and specialty coffee shop in Jakarta with a cult following. If anyone wants to try, I can buy some! They average between 700-800 for 250g roasted beans (Not too many tho since I don’t want any headaches from local customs lol)

Life is too short to spend forcing a lukewarm connection; but at the same time, there's plenty of time for someone who feels comfortable in their own skin to find that person with whom the vibes are just right.

If you're thinking the same way, why don't we meet up for dinner or a coffee and see where things go? **Try to see if there’s enough to make things work, and enough to make it interesting?**

I'll start with a few things about me:

* I’m 35 years old, standing 5’7” tall at around 67 kg (lean-ish). I have wide, expressive eyes and long, flowing, wavy black hair which gets tied into a professional manbun on weekdays and a chill ponytail on the weekends
* I live in Parañaque and work in Makati – and bike commute between these places and the rest of the Metro about 80% of the time
* I currently work in a national government agency in a senior role
* I have a bachelor’s in a social science field and am currently a graduate student (in the same field) who just passed his comprehensive exams and is now working on a thesis.
* I consider myself highly politically aware and my political views don’t just lean left, they are thoroughly left (you know, the “eat the rich”, “end Empire”, ""free Palestine"" kind)
* I love talking about food, eating it, cooking it! I collect cookbooks - 39 as of last count, mostly about Asian food and other non-Western cuisines - and watch food competition shows and documentaries religiously
* I read and accumulate fiction and non-fiction books from various online bookstores! Though these days I usually end up reading academic books and journals for work and school. The last non-academic book I finished was Joan Didion’s “Slouching Towards Bethlehem”, in April, and I’m currently working through Veeraporn Nitiprapha’s “Secrets of the Secrets of the Black Rose Cat”
* I also am into video and tabletop games! My competitiveness and curiosity often makes up for my initial lack of skills 😅
* I like the occasional outdoors activity from time to time too! I enjoy going out to see movies and plays, visit museums and historical sites, and especially browse through markets, weekend, wet or otherwise
* I love sharing my passions with other people, whether it's a new recipe I'm trying out, a book I'm ecstatic about, or a TV show I'm morbidly obsessed with
* I’m a huge yapper about a wide variety of topics but also an enthusiastic listener when needed and/or wanted
* I have been described by my siblings, friends, and coworkers as introspective, empathetic, loyal, and generous of spirit (pero medyo suplado sa unang tingin lol)
* Some ways I express affection for those closest to me: cooking and sending them food, picking out books for gifts, sending them extremely niche and specific memes, and hanging out when they need company and counsel

...And that's just to start!

Here's what I'm looking for - someone who is:

* **CHILDFREE** and **committed to living out a DINK lifestyle**;
* 28-36 years old;
* A professional working dayshift around Makati/BGC/Ortigas/South QC
* Politically aware, at least liberal to left-leaning, and can discuss current events from time to time
* Willing to exchange pictures and/or meet up sooner rather than later
* Curious about life, the world around us, and the people we share it with
* Comfortable in their own skin, or at least determined to become comfortable
* Unafraid to yap and banter in text and in person, but also willing to be a thoughtful listener (I promise the same!)
* Deeply and unapologetically nerdy about their own passions and hobbies - maybe you can teach me yours?

If what you just read speaks to you, let's talk, exchange pictures, and see where things go!

A Connection Written in the Rain

A quiet young man seeks shelter from the rain in a cozy Tokyo café. Inside, he notices an artist sketching alone in her corner. A simple accident—a spilled coffee—brings them together. They talk about the rain, the city, and the strange comfort of silence. They part as quietly as they met, without even exchanging names.

A World Built in Quiet Moments

Fate brings them together again, this time in an old library, reaching for the same book. What follows is a series of tender moments: shared coffees, walks through wet streets, and conversations under the city lights. On a rooftop overlooking Tokyo, they fly a paper plane into the night and make a quiet promise—one that hangs in the air like a secret.

When Love Isn’t Enough

As their bond deepens, a shadow falls over their happiness. One of them is holding back a painful truth—a future they can’t escape. The very connection that once felt like shelter now feels like a countdown to goodbye.

A Goodbye That Feels Like a Beginning

In a park under a flickering streetlight, the truth finally comes out. Dreams clash with duty, and love is tested by distance. They share one last moment—a hug in the rain, a whispered wish, and the unspoken understanding that some people are only meant to be a season in your life.

A Story That Stays With You

This is not just a love story. It’s a meditation on moments that change us, even when they don’t last. It’s for everyone who’s ever met someone who felt like home, only to realize they were just passing through.

---

Why You’ll Love It:

· Atmospheric & Visual: Every scene feels like a painting—rainy streets, neon reflections, quiet cafés.
· Emotional & Relatable: It captures the beauty and pain of temporary connections.
· Short & Impactful: No unnecessary drama—just raw, honest emotions.

Cons:

- sleep never improved. 
- miss the taste of puerh and green tea and good coffee
- miss the feeling of a decadent ritual in the morning
- gained 10 lbs
- pooping still not consistent
- still feel dumb, less verbally quick

Pros:

+ had to take up a cardio habit to replace my stimulant
+ maybe less audible GI noise?
+ less dithering in the morning with coffee jitters
+ maybe teeth are brighter?
+ no accidental manic ""over caffeinated"" moments
+ feel pride in navigating times of mandatory fatigue (working late, special parties) without coffee

Idk. The major reason I haven't started again yet is that it was SO hard to quit. The withdrawals (first 45 days) were ROUGH. Maybe if I quit again it would be easier tho, knowing that and how clutch cardio is.

The thing is, I didn't really have a strong reason to quit in the first place other than that my boyfriend suggested I might benefit (he doesn't use caffeine.) Oh well. Gave it a go.",2,1760278950.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1o4qbg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1o4qbg5/help_chronic_constipation/,Help Chronic constipation,"22F here. This year April I had my first constipation episode. I had blood in my stools. Went to my GP who told me to up my fibre and water intake which I did but made no difference. I was then constipated again and everytime I was I would bleed. I had a rectal examination and she said I might have a tiny internal hemmmie and prescribed me Magrocol/Miralax.
I did everything I could to get rid of this chronic constipation - 2x Kiwi, changing my diet, moving around, excersize, using a foot stool, improving my breathing, prune juice, psylium husk, magnesium glycinate and citrate, b-complex, slippery elm, coffee, herbal teas, apple cider vinegar, cayanne pepper in food. Everything. 
Whilst I did have some success with magnesium citrate and magrocol I don’t believe these are suitable long-term and I personally don’t want my bowels to become reliant on them at such a young age.
My stools currently are soft although it’s so unpredictable when I will be constipated as it happens overnight. I’m currently having fybogel and have started a carnivore diet, well I say carnivore but I do have some gluten free bread here and there. However, even though my stools are soft they are extremely hard to pass and I think after my countless constipation epsidoes I have an anal fissure or maybe 2 as they feel like theyre stretching from different areas. Every single bowel movement is like glass is coming out of me and it gives me so much anxiety that I am literally terrified to go to the toilet.
I’ve tried Anusol, sitz baths, castor oil, coconut oil, iodine, sudocrem, and vaseline but NOTHING works. I did a few stool tests and the lab told my GP to treat my condition as IBS-C.
I’m in the UK and I am on a waiting list to see a colorectal surgeon but I just feel so hopeless. Everytime I go to the toilet and can’t release I just cry lol. I just think back to the times I didn’t have this problem and how I took them times for granted. 
The worst thing is I have problems with my teeth and can’t consume a lot of sugar/acidic things as I have a clenching problem so most of my molars are just fractured. So even with natural cures that help other people, I can’t stay consistent with them because my teeth will literally fail:

Being Muslim I find it extremely hard to go into sujood with this problem especially when I’m constipated I just can’t do anything let alone be in that position which is so bad.

If anyone could give me some advice I would REALLY appreciate it. I’m honestly at my wits end with this whole situation. 😭❤️",1,1760278875.0,MuslimLounge,3,1.0,False

I would love to eventually submit fire-service articles to industry websites and magazines. This is my first attempt. I’m looking for true feedback. Does it suck? What can I do to make it better? I really appreciate it. DMs are open as well. 


18 years old and they pinned a badge on me? I called myself a firefighter and they took me in like a little brother. Fun. Exhilarating. That’s what it was.. an extension of the locker room banter I’d experienced throughout my sports career in school. “This is it..” I thought, “this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.” A little brother surrounded by giants. Geniuses in every category, I knew em all and I wanted to BE them. So I set out on my journey to learn everything I could about this craft and make it my own. And I did. As much as I could anyway, and still do. I put the time in and I learned from the best of the best. I became a part of that brotherhood.. and not just by name.

 14 years in the fire service seems like a lifetime. I mean, I grew up in it. Not literally, but I learned to like black coffee, cook a steak, learned a lot about what to do and even more-so what NOT to in a relationship, tips on raising kids, and ultimately how to solve all of the world’s problems on the front bumper of a firetruck. 

The first time I ever set foot in a bar was for a fire inspection. they let me give Morphine as a paramedic before I was able to drink a beer. And driving that big truck with the Queue siren blaring while cars part like the Red Sea? A dream.. and I was living it. After years of searching for my forever home, a full-time job , I landed not too far from my literal home;the place where I grew up.

The crew I landed with was hard, but fair. They expected a lot and tore me down just to build me back up again.  But they took me in and they had my back.  I loved every bit of it. I loved being a part of something that I was proud of. Friendships to last a lifetime. We were a team and we were damn good.

Then, it happened.. promotions, life, and every firefighters kryptonite, change. Year by year, things changed.. my crew, my department, the fire service, and ultimately me. The fire of passion I once had, dimmed to a low lit lantern running out of fuel. The diminishing flicker of flame I now had brought me to face the darkness of the idea that maybe I was done. Maybe this was a fun experiment in emerging adulthood and it was time to find a real career. One that didn’t have the tragedy, the bitching, the cliques, and what I thought exposed the facade of a “brotherhood”. Maybe I had gotten lucky with where I landed and that didn’t exist anymore. 

Was this it? Do I chase money now? I mean, I have a family to take care of now and surely I can do better than this. Now promoted to company officer and approaching middle age, it was time to figure out my next move.. fast. I didn’t have time to waste and I didn’t even recognize the once passionate rookie that was just happy to have a brush to wash the trucks. 

Then, contrary to my big money plans, they came in.. the rookies. The next generation. And man are they young. And I mean YOUNG. Do you even have a license? I often ask, laughing at the irony that I was in there shoes just over a decade ago. They’re in. For all of it.  and.. to my surprise? We’re the giants now. I recognize the familiarity of the wide-eyed job hungry rookies of today. They’re asking questions, watching us like hawks, and soaking up every lesson, good and bad. And it’s now hit me, this isn’t just about me anymore. This is about them. The next generation. The community. It’s about the ones who will carry the torch when we’re long gone. It’s about the ones who are always going to need our service. THAT’S what this job is about and THAT’S why I do it. Next, we get to shape the now. 

I’ve come to realize that the fire service I was questioning, the one I thought had lost its way, isn’t a finished story. It’s a living thing, shaped by every one of us who wears the badge. The cliques, the bitching, the fading brotherhood? Those aren’t the fire service itself, they’re symptoms of us letting the flame dim.

See, the fire service we saw when we got into it didn’t just develop by happenstance. It was one that was molded and created by those before us. Now it’s our turn. No matter the circumstances and difficulties. It’s our job to overcome and deliver to the next generation. 

I’m not the only one shocked by this sudden responsibility because a lot of my peers seem stagnant and unwilling, but it’s time for a wake up call. It’s time that my generation steps up and ensures the fire service maintains the standard that it always has. You are tomorrow’s leaders. Whether you like it or not. 

We bitch about button ups and pub Eds. The next generation will find something else to complain about and that’s okay. If their biggest complaints are about uniforms and educational events, then we’ll be doing something right. What’s most important is that we have people committed to step up and lead. Tragedies will happen, houses will burn and unfortunately, people will die. It’s our job to make sure that we’re responding and performing at the highest level. 

We don’t just have a responsibility, we have an obligation. We have an obligation to leave the fire service better than we found it and that’s worth more than we could ever be paid.

I started 20 mg Adderall about a month ago and take it daily. It’s helping a lot, I can actually focus without feeling like I’m fighting for my life to pay attention.

My main issue is an elevated heart rate for about 1–2 hours after it kicks in. It’s improved a bit but still happens, even without coffee. I’ve cut back from 8 cups a day to 2 and usually wait until I’m at my desk to drink it. My resting heart rate is up about 5% overall. Example- took med at 6 am, hr started going up around 630/645. Was 97 at 8 am today when I checked and dropped to 85 within half hr.)

I tried propranolol the first few days, but it made me feel detached, so I stopped. My doctor said I could try half a pill. I’m also on Lexapro for OCD/GAD — recently increased from 10 to 15 mg, though I’ve been easing in with 12.5 mg. It hasn’t really helped the physical side effects so far.

I'm thinking of lowering dose, maybe using propranolol long-term, or switching meds? Adderall helps so much that I’m hesitant to change, but the first couple of hours are uncomfortable.

I’m also wary of stacking too many meds... maybe that’s my anxiety, but I’d rather keep things simple if there’s a single option that works without trading one side effect for another. This process is definitely frustrating, but overall not as bad as I expected.",3,1760278565.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False
