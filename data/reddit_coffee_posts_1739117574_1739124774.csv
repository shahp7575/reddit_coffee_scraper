https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/houston.html

Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today we will be dissecting ‚ÄúHouston‚Äù which is the fifth track from the band‚Äôs fourteenth studio album Accelerate. 

Now if you‚Äôve been following along with the weekly song discussions for this album you‚Äôll know that this album is politically charged. And it seems like ‚ÄúHouston‚Äù is the centerpiece when it comes to these lyrical themes with the song being about the response from the George W. Bush Administration to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in Houston. 

Musically, the song begins with a somber but uptempo acoustic guitar progression before being slammed with a hard as hell organ riff and some crunchy drums and sliding bass lines. Mike said that he heard Peter strumming this progression and it inspired him to jump on the organ. Fantastic choice. 

If that wasn‚Äôt enough to wake you up, Michael hits us with the phenomenal opening lyric ‚Äúif the storm doesn‚Äôt kill me, the government will.‚Äù It‚Äôs such a powerful line that it was later altered and reused in ‚ÄúOh my heart.‚Äù Michael puts us in the mindset of the refugees that fled to Houston after Hurricane Katrina where they were hit with more disasters. It‚Äôs specifically a response to when First Lady Barbara Brush said ‚Äúso many of the people were underprivileged anyway, so this is working well for them.‚Äù That alone fired Michael up to lend his voice towards this song. 

Although this first lyric is dark in the sense of how real it is, the next couple of lines are hopeful despite the times. Michal‚Äôs sings about how he was told to hang his head high and begin everyday as if it‚Äôs a new day. You have to make the best of what the day has to offer which at the time meant getting some rest, drinking some coffee and collecting your belongings. 

This message is reflected in the music in the chorus as the song starts to lift, especially with Michael‚Äôs softer vocal approach. He sings about how Houston is ‚Äúfilled with promise‚Äù despite the Bush‚Äôs comments and how Laredo is a beautiful place. Then we get the interesting lyric ‚ÄúGalveston sings like that song that I loved, its meaning has not been erased.‚Äù ‚ÄúGalveston‚Äù is a reference to a song written by Jimmy Webb, made popular by Glen Campbell. As we know from songs from Reveal, the band were fans of both musicians and Michael said during their 2008 ACL taping that ‚ÄúHouston‚Äù was mean to be a rewritten version of ‚ÄúGalveston‚Äù which he grew up with and loved. 

This chorus transitions to an instrumental section with just the acoustic guitar and shaker before the organ and bass returns. Here is where Michael beautifully sings ‚Äúand so there are claims forgiven. And so there are things that are gone.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt even imagine what people lost during those hurricanes. 

After one last chorus the band continues into one last altered chorus with an additional chord as Michael continues to sing. He sings about how his belief is not going to fail him as he‚Äôs put to the test. It‚Äôs almost like a call to action as this character realizes there‚Äôs going to be some tough times ahead and yet they have to be strong and persevere. And with that the song comes an end in just over two minutes. 

If you‚Äôre not a fan of the politic content or the more industry sound of the music I can understand. Although I feel like this is actually one of the more powerful songs on the album despite it not rocking out as much. The music (and its short run time) is the perfect soundscape for Michael‚Äôs moving lyrics where he puts us in the minds of people who had to suffer from the lack of support from the government. And in some ways the song is still relevant today. It has the lyrics of some of the songs from Around the Sun but with much more interesting music. 

But what do you think of this tune? Is this one of the better tracks from this album? What do you think the song is about? Favorite lyrical or musical moments? And did you catch the song live?",1,1739124102.0,rem,0,1.0,False

Since there were no solutions to all of these problems readily available, I learned Fusion 360 and created custom drip tray to accommodate integrated scales that is also diverting water and replaced water a tank with a water collection tray that has a line to the sewer.

I've recently learned about Epoch Chemistry (a roaster of coffee operating out of Moncton), and now I'm rather interested in trying their stuff. The issue is that I have no way to make the 2¬Ω or 3 hour drive down to try it in the flesh, and I'm too stubborn to pay shipping and handling on anything I can technically get my hands on in the flesh. Any of y'all know of other caf√©s/shops that sell their products? Or does Epoch *only* sell through their site and store? And if it's only this way do they charge much on shipping and handling to send orders to other parts of the province?

If this is against the rules, mods, then just delete this and tell me to fuck off. Otherwise a few pointers would be cool. I know where to get most of the other NB roasters' products, Epoch is just the one that I have never spotted out and thus the current apple of my eye. I'd really hate to have to order online.

1ilkp7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialFiction/comments/1ilkp7l/the_worlds_slowest_trains/,The World‚Äôs Slowest Trains,"Blood trickled down Elias‚Äôs temple, warm, sticky. He wiped it away and pushed forward, the rails groaning beneath his feet. Behind him, the shriek of twisted metal and something worse‚Äîa sound that didn‚Äôt belong to this world‚Äîechoed through the dead station.

The train had arrived. Late, but it had arrived.

He stumbled, lungs raw from running, and risked a glance back. The thing in the conductor‚Äôs seat wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. Once, perhaps, before the uniform had fused with its flesh, before its fingers had elongated into cords of gristle gripping the brake lever. Now it watched with lidless sockets, gears clicking in the spaces where pupils should be.

""Ticket,"" it rasped. Not a request. A demand.

Elias had none. He ran.

The station‚Äîif it could still be called that‚Äîextended impossibly in all directions. Archways flickered between marble grandeur and rusted ruin, time undecided. The trains waiting on their tracks bore names that didn‚Äôt make sense: The Everforward, Nocturne of Rust, Leviathan‚Äôs Waltz. Some of them moved, but at a pace that defied physics. Too slow. A single revolution of a wheel took minutes, yet they were in motion.

A whistle blew.

Not the sharp note of departure. No, this was a dirge, an announcement of something waking.

He veered left, past a platform where figures wrapped in gauze stood motionless, their faces featureless beneath layers of cloth. He didn‚Äôt dare slow down. Didn‚Äôt dare listen to the whispers curling from beneath their bandages.

A door. A possibility. He lunged, shoving his weight against it. The handle fought back, metal groaning, but it relented.

Inside, the train car stretched into infinity. Not a straight line‚Äîno, it bent, curved, looped in on itself like an ouroboros of steel and velvet seats. Chandeliers swung overhead, casting fractured shadows. Passengers sat in orderly rows, eyes forward, hands folded. They did not blink.

""Where to?""

The voice came from beside him. A woman‚Äîperhaps. Her face was smooth, too smooth, the approximation of a human carved from wax. She held a ledger, quill poised.

""I‚Äî"" Elias hesitated. ""I don‚Äôt have a ticket.""

""Then you ride below,"" she intoned.

The floor vanished.

He plummeted.

Darkness swallowed him whole, thick as oil, cold as the void between stars. He hit something‚Äîhard. Iron bars. Chains rattled. A scent like burnt time stung his nostrils. Around him, others groaned, their voices warped, stretched.

The undercarriage.

Not meant for passengers.

Above, through the grates, he saw the slow churn of wheels, their motion glacial. No speed, no escape, only the eternal, creeping passage forward. The train did not rush. It did not hurry. It would arrive at its destination, always. Eventually.

""New one,"" a voice hissed. Not human. Something too long, too thin slithered closer. ""You‚Äôll get used to it.""

Elias gripped the bars, desperate. ""Used to what?""

The thing grinned, a mouth too wide. ""The waiting.""

And the train rolled on.

Elias refused to accept it.

The undercarriage swayed, the iron bars creaking with every glacial lurch of the wheels. Around him, the other passengers‚Äîor prisoners‚Äîhuddled in the dark, their bodies twisted, too many limbs in the wrong places. Some had given up, their eyes vacant, their mouths mumbling silent prayers to gods that had never ridden the rails. Others rocked back and forth, their patience calcified into something brittle and dangerous.

Elias dug his fingers into the bars, knuckles whitening. The train moved too slowly. That was the trick.

Not stopping. Never stopping.

And time‚Äîtime‚Äîwas different here.

A man to his right, or what had been a man once, whispered, ""I boarded The Gloaming Line when the emperor still ruled. Thought I was on my way to the capital. Thought I'd be home in time for the Festival of Lanterns. That was two hundred years ago. Maybe three.""

Elias‚Äôs stomach knotted. ""You're lying.""

The thing that was once a man grinned, showing teeth ground to dull nubs. ""Does it matter?""

No. It didn‚Äôt.

A metallic groan shuddered through the frame, the train adjusting its course. Beneath them, something massive exhaled. Elias‚Äôs breath hitched.

They weren‚Äôt rolling on tracks.

He pressed his face to the bars, peering down. The darkness below wasn‚Äôt empty. It wasn‚Äôt land, either. It moved, churned, stretched into a thing of endless sinew and glistening carapace. Something carried the train. Something that had never seen the sun.

Something waiting.

He recoiled, heart hammering.

No. No, he wouldn‚Äôt stay here.

A clang.

Elias twisted, searching. A figure was moving through the undercarriage, a silhouette barely discernible in the murk. Not one of the others. Something different.

The figure crouched beside him. ""You‚Äôre new,"" it whispered. A woman‚Äôs voice, rough, sharpened by time. She smelled of rust and ozone, like a storm that never broke.

Elias‚Äôs throat tightened. ""I need to get out.""

A chuckle. ""Everyone does.""

She reached into her coat‚Äîan old conductor‚Äôs uniform, tattered, the insignia unrecognizable‚Äîand pulled out something small. A key.

His pulse jumped.

""Why help me?"" he asked.

""Because I remember what it was like to believe you could still leave,"" she said, voice like crushed glass. ""And because we don‚Äôt have much time.""

Elias stiffened. ""What do you mean?""

Above them, a whistle screamed.

Not just any whistle.

A warning.

The train was changing lines.

The woman shoved the key into his palm, her grip like iron. ""Listen carefully. There‚Äôs an emergency exit in the next car up. It‚Äôs locked, but this will open it. You get one chance. If you miss it‚Äî""

The train lurched. The walls groaned, warping, stretching. The space between them seemed to double, triple.

""No,"" the woman snarled. ""Not yet‚Äî""

The world twisted.

Elias was thrown backward, his body flung through the bars, through the dark, into somewhere else.

He hit the floor‚Äîhard. The scent of old paper and burning copper filled his lungs. He gasped, rolling onto his back, chest heaving.

He was no longer in the undercarriage.

He was in a library.

A moving library.

Shelves stretched infinitely in all directions, crammed with books that bled ink and whispered as they shifted. Ladders swung from invisible forces, and far above, something watched.

A voice spoke, low and rolling, full of weight.

""You do not belong here.""

Elias turned. A figure loomed behind a desk of dark wood and bone. No eyes. No mouth. Only hands‚Äîtoo many hands, all writing at once.

The Archivist.

""You have violated the order of passage,"" the thing intoned, its words sinking into his skull. ""You were meant to ride, not to arrive.""

Elias scrambled back. ""I‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî""

The Archivist lifted one hand. Snapped its fingers.

The bookshelves trembled. The library breathed.

Elias scrambled to his feet, the floor beneath him breathing, pulsing like the soft tissue of something alive. The books‚Äîif they could still be called that‚Äîshuddered on their shelves, pages curling, inky tendrils slithering from the bindings. Some bled symbols that dripped onto the floor like molten wax. Others whispered in voices that shouldn‚Äôt know his name.

He turned in every direction, but the library had no doors. No windows.

Only the Archivist.

It moved without moving, shifting closer in a way that broke logic. Its too-many hands wrote furiously, scripts folding into each other‚Äîcuneiform bleeding into Cyrillic, Latin twisting into eldritch glyphs. Every word it wrote became reality, reshaping the space around him.

Elias took a step back. The floor sighed.

""You have disrupted the sequence,"" the Archivist droned, its voice not in his ears, but in his bones. ""Correction is required.""

The bookshelves snapped forward, towering, convulsing.

Elias turned to run.

Too late.

The floor collapsed beneath him, and he fell through the sentences of a book not yet finished.

‚Äî

He landed in a street. Not a normal one.

The cobblestones pulsed, shifting like the vertebrae of a buried colossus. The air tasted of forgotten prayers and rust. Gas lamps flickered with an unnatural glow‚Äîlight without warmth.

A train station loomed at the end of the street, but it wasn‚Äôt just one station. It was all stations, stacked atop each other like a terrible, impossible collage. Signs flickered between languages. Gates opened to places that had never existed.

And Elias wasn‚Äôt alone.

People walked past him, but their faces were unfinished. Smooth, featureless, placeholders for something yet to be defined. They moved with the slow inevitability of those who had never stopped moving.

Elias‚Äôs breath hitched.

The train tracks weren‚Äôt steel. They were spines. Twisted, fused vertebrae stretching into a fog where the sky should be.

And the train‚ÄîThe World‚Äôs Slowest Train‚Äîwas coming.

It wasn‚Äôt on the tracks.

It was the tracks.

It emerged from the fog in pieces, a fractured machine, eternally assembling itself from the remains of its passengers. Wheels made of ribcages. Windows formed from eyes that refused to blink. The whistle‚ÄîGod, the whistle‚Äîwas a human scream, stretched and distorted into something that would never end.

Elias turned to run‚Äî

A hand clamped onto his wrist.

He whipped around.

The woman from the undercarriage. The one with the rust-smell. Her grip was firmer now, more real.

""You‚Äôre out of time,"" she hissed.

The world tilted.

The street peeled apart, revealing what had been hidden beneath:

Another train. Not one. Thousands. Layered atop one another, moving so slowly they blurred the line between arrival and departure.

She yanked him forward.

""There‚Äôs only one way off this line,"" she growled. ""And it won‚Äôt be easy.""

Elias barely found his voice. ""What is this place?""

She grinned. This time, her teeth weren‚Äôt human.

""Transit.""

And then the sky opened like a mouth, and the next station arrived.

Elias stumbled, mind reeling, gut churning. The line. The trains. The stations. The impossible, grinding slowness of it all.

""You keep saying that,"" he spat, twisting his wrist free from the woman‚Äôs grip. ""Transit. The line. What the hell does it mean?""

The woman exhaled through her teeth, glancing up. The sky remained open, gaping, revealing things moving behind it‚Äîsinuous, sprawling, cosmic beyond comprehension.

""Look around,"" she said. ""Really look.""

Elias hesitated.

Then he saw it.

The passengers.

Not just on the streets, not just in the trains, but everywhere. Some frozen mid-step. Some stepping through doors that led to nowhere. Some halfway through boarding, their bodies fading into the threshold of cars that never truly arrived.

Suspended.

Not alive.

Not dead.

Waiting.

The realization hit him like a hammer. ""They never get there, do they?""

The woman nodded. ""Welcome to the World‚Äôs Slowest Trains.""

Elias swallowed. ""What is this place?""

""A transit system for the unmoored. The misplaced. The lost. Those who slipped between the cracks of time, space, logic."" Her voice was bitter. ""If you boarded without a ticket, you‚Äôre part of the system now. You move forward, stop by stop, forever.""

""Forever?""

""Unless you get off the line.""

His pulse jumped. ""How?""

She grabbed his collar, yanking him close. ""The system only lets people off if they arrive. And the trains don‚Äôt arrive."" Her eyes glowed dull red in the lamplight. ""But there‚Äôs another way.""

The wind shifted.

The train approaching was different. Bigger. Older. The steel groaned under its own impossible weight. The front car had no headlights‚Äîonly a grinning maw, filled with grinding gears, chewing the air itself.

The woman pulled him behind a half-collapsed station sign. ""There‚Äôs a station. An end station.""

Elias‚Äôs mouth went dry. ""I thought you said they never arrive.""

""They don‚Äôt. Not normally."" Her fingers tightened on his wrist. ""But there‚Äôs a station that isn‚Äôt supposed to exist. A final stop. A terminal. Not part of the schedule. Not part of the route. It‚Äôs been erased from the maps.""

Elias‚Äôs stomach twisted. ""Why?""

The woman‚Äôs face darkened. ""Because it‚Äôs the only place where passengers can get off.""

The words sat between them like a guillotine blade.

The train shuddered into the station, inching forward with glacial inevitability.

""You‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs an exit?"" Elias asked, heart hammering. ""Where?""

The woman‚Äôs expression sharpened. ""Between.""

""Between what?""

She grabbed him, yanking him into a sprint as the train doors slid open. ""Between departures. Between arrivals. Between the damn seconds this place pretends to have!""

Elias ran, feet pounding on shifting stone. ""And how do I get to it?""

""You jump.""

""Jump?""

She pulled him harder. ""When the train is switching lines, there's a gap. Just a moment. A crack in the schedule."" Her breath was ragged. ""You fall into it. You ride the void. And if you‚Äôre lucky‚Äîif you‚Äôre really, really lucky‚Äîyou land somewhere real.""

Elias‚Äôs stomach turned. ""And if I‚Äôm not lucky?""

She didn‚Äôt answer.

The train doors groaned, the passengers moving with agonizing slowness.

Elias exhaled. His hands clenched into fists.

One chance.

One jump.

One crack between realities.

He sprinted forward, lungs burning.

And as the train began to shift, flickering between stops, he jumped.

The air tore apart around him. Not wind‚Äîsomething else. Something older, rawer, a force that existed before time itself was nailed into place.

The moment stretched. The world bled.

He was falling between seconds.

Reality around him flickered like a dying film reel. For an instant, he saw the trains. Not just the one he had fled, but all of them, stacked atop one another, winding through an impossible, endless system. There were lines that looped into their own pasts, rails that folded in on themselves, stations where the passengers were still boarding after centuries of waiting.

A voice whispered:

""You do not belong here.""

The Archivist.

Elias twisted mid-fall.

The library was still there‚Äîwoven between the train tracks, coiled in the architecture of waiting. The Archivist‚Äôs many hands were still writing, rewriting, correcting.

Something in the darkness reached for him.

Not today.

Elias stretched his hands forward. The crack‚Äîthe gap‚Äîwas closing.

And then‚Äî

‚Äî

Cold air. Real air.

Elias slammed into solid ground, his body skidding across rough pavement. His lungs burned, his limbs screamed, but‚Äî

The world wasn‚Äôt moving impossibly slow.

He gasped, sucking in deep, ragged breaths. His vision swam. He could taste the metallic tang of now.

He was in a station. A real one.

The walls weren‚Äôt shifting between centuries. The lights weren‚Äôt flickering between existence and erasure.

A voice echoed over the loudspeakers:

""Last call for the 11:45 to St. Augustine. Boarding now at Platform 4.""

He turned.

A train. A normal train. The kind with doors that opened and closed at human speed, the kind with seats and windows that reflected reality instead of devouring it.

Elias‚Äôs breath hitched. He touched his own arms, his chest. He was whole. He was here.

A laugh bubbled in his throat, raw and half-mad. He had done it.

He had gotten off the line.

The overhead clock ticked forward. Not back, not sideways‚Äîforward.

The announcement repeated itself.

Elias hesitated. Then, step by step, he walked toward the train.

Not running. Not rushing.

Because, for the first time in what felt like eternity‚Äî

He was on time.

Elias reached the platform, heart still hammering, body aching from the fall, mind struggling to accept that he had arrived. The train stood in front of him, its doors open, golden light spilling onto the platform. It smelled like earthly things‚Äîoil, metal, warm fabric, old coffee.

Not rust. Not ink. Not the agonizing slowness of eternity.

He stepped forward. One foot. Then another.

And then‚Äî

""Ticket, sir?""

The voice stopped him cold.

He turned.

The conductor stood at the door, dressed in a crisp navy uniform, cap tilted just so. But his face‚Äî

No.

Elias‚Äôs stomach clenched. He had seen that face before. Too smooth. Too perfect. Like it had been carved to be an approximation of a man.

Just like the others.

Just like the woman.

Elias swallowed. ""I don‚Äôt have one.""

The conductor smiled. His teeth were too white. Too even. ""Ah. Well."" He extended a gloved hand. ""Then I‚Äôm afraid you can‚Äôt board.""

Panic flared. ""No‚Äîwait, listen‚Äî""

The conductor‚Äôs head tilted. The smile widened. ""No ticket means no passage.""

The train let out a low, real whistle.

Doors hissing. Wheels shifting.

Elias lunged.

The conductor‚Äôs hand caught his wrist.

And in that instant, everything changed.

The world folded. The air turned to molasses. Sound slowed, stretching, distorting, peeling apart.

The station wasn‚Äôt a station anymore.

The train wasn‚Äôt a train anymore.

The doors weren‚Äôt metal. They were a maw, yawning open, lined with rows of glistening, wet teeth.

The conductor‚Äôs grip tightened.

Elias screamed.

The platform wasn‚Äôt solid. It was slipping beneath him, breaking apart into black ribbons of track, spiraling back toward the thing he had escaped.

""No‚ÄîNO! I GOT OFF! I GOT OFF!""

The conductor leaned in, voice smooth as glass. ""You left the line.""

Elias struggled, nails digging into flesh that wasn‚Äôt flesh anymore. ""Yes!""

""But you did not arrive.""

His blood turned to ice.

The train wasn‚Äôt leaving. It was waiting.

Waiting for him to step back. To slip. To return.

Elias‚Äôs vision blurred. No ticket. No proof. No passage.

His fingers clawed at his captor‚Äôs grip. ""There has to be a way!""

The conductor sighed, a sound of mock sympathy. ""There is.""

His free hand reached into his coat. Produced something thin, something aged.

A ticket.

Old. Yellowed. Frayed at the edges.

Elias‚Äôs heart pounded. ""That‚Äî that‚Äôs my way out?""

The conductor grinned. ""One must be punched to ride.""

Elias reached for it.

And the conductor plunged his fingers into Elias‚Äôs chest.

Pain. Cold. A tearing sensation, not of flesh but of something deeper, something fundamental.

Elias screamed.

The train doors yawned wider.

His vision swam.

He looked down.

A hole gaped in his chest, a gap where time should be.

The conductor pulled something out of him‚Äîsomething bright, beating, writhing like a severed nerve. Elias felt it leave him, felt a piece of himself being punched out, snipped from existence.

The conductor held it between his fingers, inspecting it like a diamond in the light.

""Ah,"" he murmured, flicking it once. ""A fine fare.""

Elias collapsed.

The pain stopped.

The train was gone.

The station was silent.

Elias lay on the cold floor, gasping, whole but hollow.

Something was missing.

Not an organ. Not blood.

Something else.

He sat up slowly, head spinning. His hands trembled. The clock on the wall ticked forward. The world around him was real. He had made it.

But something was wrong.

He felt lighter.

Like part of him had been left behind.

Like part of him was still waiting on the line.

And somewhere, in the dark corners of an impossible transit system, a train rumbled forward.

Slowly.

Eternally.

Still carrying the pieces of those who had never truly arrived.",1,1739123938.0,ArtificialFiction,0,1.0,False

Having tried various health products over the years with mixed results, I wasn‚Äôt sure if this would truly stand out. After using Liv Pure consistently for three months, I feel confident sharing my detailed experience, highlighting its benefits, challenges, and overall effectiveness.

Why I Chose Liv Pure‚Äã

The premise of Liv Pure resonated with me. The idea that liver health plays a crucial role in weight management wasn‚Äôt new, but Liv Pure‚Äôs dual-action approach intrigued me. The supplement promised not just to detoxify the liver but also to enhance fat-burning processes, all while being made from natural ingredients like milk thistle, acai, and other plant-based extracts. With glowing online reviews and a growing reputation in the wellness community, I decided to give it a shot.

First Impressions‚Äã

From the start, Liv Pure impressed me with its professional presentation. The packaging was sleek and secure, and the product information was clear and easy to understand. The capsules were standard-sized, making them easy to swallow, and there was no unpleasant aftertaste‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve encountered with other supplements. The instructions recommended taking two capsules daily with water, preferably with a meal, so I incorporated it into my morning routine for consistency.‚Äã

The First Month: Detox and Adjustments‚Äã

During the first few weeks, I noticed subtle changes. Liv Pure‚Äôs liver detoxification properties seemed to kick in quickly. I felt lighter, and there was a noticeable improvement in my digestion. I used to experience occasional bloating, but this subsided significantly after starting the supplement.

What truly surprised me was the gradual increase in my energy levels. By the end of the first month, I wasn‚Äôt relying on my usual midday coffee to get through the afternoon. I also felt more motivated to stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine, which complemented the supplement‚Äôs effects.

Month Two: Visible Changes‚Äã

As I moved into the second month, the weight loss benefits became more noticeable. I had lost about 6 pounds by the end of this period, and my clothes started fitting better. While I wouldn‚Äôt call this a miracle transformation, it was evident that Liv Pure was helping my body burn fat more efficiently.

What I appreciated most was the balanced approach of the supplement. Unlike some weight loss products that can feel overly aggressive, Liv Pure‚Äôs effects were steady and sustainable. I also felt a stronger sense of overall well-being, which I attribute to the supplement‚Äôs liver-supporting ingredients.

Month Three: Long-Term Benefits‚Äã

By the third month, the results were undeniable. I had lost a total of 12 pounds, and my energy levels were at an all-time high. I felt more active and less fatigued, even after long days at work. My skin also appeared clearer, which I believe is a byproduct of improved liver health.

One unexpected benefit was the impact on my mood. Liv Pure‚Äôs natural composition seemed to contribute to better mental clarity and reduced stress levels. Whether this was due to the supplement itself or the confidence boost from feeling healthier, I can‚Äôt say for sure‚Äîbut the overall effect was remarkable.

Key Features I Loved‚Äã

Natural Ingredients: Knowing that Liv Pure was made with natural components like acai and milk thistle gave me peace of mind. These ingredients are well-known for their detoxifying and antioxidant properties, and they seemed to work harmoniously in this formula.‚Äã

Ease of Use: Taking two capsules a day was simple and didn‚Äôt feel like a chore. The absence of side effects made it easy to incorporate into my daily routine.‚Äã

Holistic Benefits: Beyond weight loss, I noticed improvements in digestion, energy levels, and overall vitality.‚Äã

Science-Backed Approach: The dual-action mechanism of supporting liver health while boosting metabolism felt grounded in science, which gave me confidence in the product.‚Äã

Challenges‚Äã

While my experience with Liv Pure was overwhelmingly positive, there are a few aspects worth noting:

Results May Vary: My husband also tried Liv Pure, but his results were slower. While he did experience better energy levels, his weight loss wasn‚Äôt as pronounced. This underscores that individual results can vary depending on factors like metabolism and lifestyle.‚Äã

Availability: Liv Pure is only available online, which might be inconvenient for those who prefer in-store purchases. Additionally, it‚Äôs important to purchase from the official website to avoid counterfeit products.‚Äã

Cost: While I found the price reasonable for the benefits I received, it might be on the higher side for some. However, the multi-bottle discounts and occasional promotions help offset the cost.‚Äã

Comparison with Other Products‚Äã

Before trying Liv Pure, I had experimented with other liver detox and weight loss supplements, but none delivered the same comprehensive benefits. Many products focus solely on weight loss, often ignoring the role of liver health. Liv Pure‚Äôs unique approach to addressing both aspects felt more holistic and effective.

Why I Chose Liv Pure‚Äã

The premise of Liv Pure resonated with me. The idea that liver health plays a crucial role in weight management wasn‚Äôt new, but Liv Pure‚Äôs dual-action approach intrigued me.

First Impressions‚Äã

From the start, Liv Pure impressed me with its professional presentation. The packaging was sleek and secure, and the product information was clear and easy to understand.

The instructions recommended taking two capsules daily with water, preferably with a meal, so I incorporated it into my morning routine for consistency.‚Äã

The First Month: Detox and Adjustments‚Äã

During the first few weeks, I noticed subtle changes. Liv Pure‚Äôs liver detoxification properties seemed to kick in quickly. I felt lighter, and there was a noticeable improvement in my digestion. I used to experience occasional bloating, but this subsided significantly after starting the supplement.

What truly surprised me was the gradual increase in my energy levels. By the end of the first month, I wasn‚Äôt relying on my usual midday coffee to get through the afternoon. I also felt more motivated to stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine, which complemented the supplement‚Äôs effects.

Month Two: Visible Changes‚Äã

As I moved into the second month, the weight loss benefits became more noticeable. I had lost about 6 pounds by the end of this period, and my clothes started fitting better. While I wouldn‚Äôt call this a miracle transformation, it was evident that Liv Pure was helping my body burn fat more efficiently.

1ilknt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1ilknt8/breaking_down_test_anxiety_causes_how_to_gauge_it/,"Breaking Down Test Anxiety: Causes, How to Gauge It, and Managing It During Your Prep ‚Äì A GMAT Tutor‚Äôs Insights","The GMAT, as you likely know by now, is more of a psychological test than a purely knowledge-based one. While having a solid grasp of concepts and structure is essential, you‚Äôve probably realized that knowledge alone isn‚Äôt enough to succeed. Your mental state during the exam‚Äîand even throughout your prep‚Äîplays a critical role in your performance.

One big hurdle we all face is test anxiety‚Äîan intricate mix of emotional, cognitive, and physiological responses to the pressure of a high-stakes exam. Almost all GMAT takers struggle with it‚Äîsometimes more than the test content itself. ***Every student I‚Äôve spoken to has faced it in some way; heck, I‚Äôve dealt with it myself.***

So, I thought I‚Äôd bring my research expertise into play and break it down: why it happens, how to gauge it, and what we can do to mitigate it.

*That said, this journey is deeply personal. If your anxiety feels overwhelming or clinical, I strongly encourage you to seek guidance from a diagnostic clinician.*

# Why Test Anxiety Happens

Let‚Äôs break down why test anxiety occurs. It can be broadly categorized into the following:

**1. Fear of Failure**

* High expectations‚Äîwhether self-imposed or from others‚Äîcreate immense pressure.
* Worrying about disappointing family, peers, or mentors makes the stakes feel impossibly high.
* The fear of perceived impacts on future opportunities amplifies this anxiety.

*A student once told me, ‚ÄúWhat if I fail? What if I don't get an MBA? I‚Äôve never failed before‚Äîam I now a failure?‚Äù This fear often stems from the need to prove yourself to others. But let‚Äôs pause and think:* ***If an obscure exam is the biggest problem in your life, isn‚Äôt that a privilege in itself? Shifting your perspective to focus on your blessings can be immensely grounding.***

**2. Lack of Preparation**

* Incomplete study or last-minute cramming leads to feeling unprepared.
* Poor time management and inefficient techniques‚Äîlike memorizing instead of understanding‚Äîare common problems. *You can memorize every question type and trick in the world, but can you recall them under pressure during the exam?*
* Think about when you‚Äôve been most confident in client presentations‚Äîit‚Äôs likely when you had done all the prep work. The GMAT is no different.

**3. Past Negative Experiences and Cognitive Distortions**

Past failures or underperformance often fuel anxiety. Experiences like blanking out or scoring poorly can condition you to associate tests with stress.

Cognitive distortions play a big role:

   * **Catastrophizing**: *‚ÄúIf I fail, my life is over.‚Äù*
   * **Overgeneralization**: *‚ÄúI always do badly on tests.‚Äù*
   * **Black-and-white thinking**: *‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt ace this, I‚Äôm not smart.‚Äù*

**4. Perfectionism and Unrealistic Expectations**

Fear of making mistakes or setting excessively high goals creates a pressure cooker of anxiety. Many students see anything less than a perfect score as failure‚Äîa mindset that‚Äôs both unsustainable and unhealthy.

**5. Lack of Familiarity with the Test Format**

Uncertainty about question types, timing, or difficulty levels adds to the stress. Not practicing under realistic conditions or understanding how adaptive testing works (as with the GMAT) leaves you unprepared.

**6. External Pressures and Comparisons**

Seeing peers excel while you struggle can feel demoralizing. The competitive nature of MBA applications only intensifies this pressure. Social media amplifies success stories, making you feel worse about your own challenges.

*Platforms like Reddit, for example, often highlight extremes‚Äîtop scorers or those lamenting failure‚Äîwhich feeds into anxiety.*

**7. Sedentary Lifestyle and High Cortisol Levels**

A sedentary lifestyle contributes to higher cortisol levels, the body‚Äôs primary stress hormone, which exacerbates feelings of anxiety. Lack of physical activity disrupts sleep, impairs mood, and affects cognitive function, making it harder to focus during prep or on test day.

**8. Burnout and Overstudying**

Studying excessively without breaks leads to mental and physical exhaustion.

*Sleep deprivation‚Äîa common issue among test-takers‚Äîcan impair cognitive function by up to 40%. Structuring your lifestyle and setting boundaries for study time are non-negotiable.*

**9. Physiological and Emotional Stress Responses**

Anxiety triggers physical symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, or shortness of breath. These responses often override rational thinking, making it difficult to concentrate.

Managing these factors starts with understanding what drives your anxiety. Once you identify the triggers, you can take intentional steps to mitigate them

# How to Gauge Your Anxiety Levels

Understanding the intensity of your anxiety is the first step to managing it effectively. Here are practical ways to assess your test anxiety:

**1. Reflect on Symptoms**

Take a moment to observe how anxiety shows up for you:

* **Emotional:** Do you feel overwhelmed, excessively worried, or unusually irritable?
* **Cognitive:** Are you struggling to focus, overthinking scenarios, or stuck in a loop of negative thoughts?
* **Physical:** Do you notice headaches, sweating, rapid heartbeats, or a feeling of tightness in your chest?

**2. Use an Anxiety Scale & Track Physiological Signs**

Utilize tools like the **Westside Test Anxiety Scale** or the **Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)** to rate your symptoms. These scales can help you classify your anxiety level as minimal, moderate, high, or severe.

Consider using smartwatches or stress-monitoring apps to measure metrics like your resting heart rate. Anxiety often elevates these levels, making them a helpful indicator of how your body is responding to stress.

**3. Journal Your Triggers and Use a DIY Anxiety Check**

Keep a journal to document anxious moments and their triggers. For example: *‚ÄúFelt nervous after a low practice test score‚Äù* or *‚ÄúHeart raced when reviewing quantitative concepts.‚Äù* Identifying patterns can help you understand what needs attention.

Additionally, you can do a **DIY Anxiety Check** by rating the following statements from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always):^(\*Questions are based on two main dimensions from the) **^(Multidimensional Theory of Anxiety)**^(:)**^(Cognitive Anxiety & Somatic Anxiety)**

1. I worry excessively about the outcome of tests.
2. My heart races before studying or testing.
3. I avoid preparing because I feel overwhelmed.
4. I struggle to retain information due to constant worry.
5. I feel my performance doesn‚Äôt reflect my abilities.

**Score Interpretation:**

* **5‚Äì10:** Minimal Anxiety
* **11‚Äì15:** Moderate Anxiety
* **16‚Äì20:** High Anxiety
* **21‚Äì25:** Severe Anxiety

*I had students take a weekly DIY test, tracking and journaling their anxiety levels. As expected, anxiety increased as the exam approached, but with effective management, they were able to bring it down.*

# How to Mitigate Test Anxiety

Now that we understand how to gauge them - lets talk about few things which we can do to mitigate any test anxiety we may have. 

# 1. Reframe Your Mindset: Shift from Fear to Challenge

* **Adopt a Growth Mindset:** Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures. Focus on progress, not perfection.
* **Normalize Anxiety:** Even top scorers feel test anxiety. Reframe it as excitement‚Äîyour body is preparing to perform.
* **Replace Negative Thoughts with Affirmations:**
   * Instead of *‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad at tests,‚Äù* say *‚ÄúI‚Äôm improving with practice.‚Äù*
   * Instead of *‚ÄúIf I fail, my life is over,‚Äù* say *‚ÄúThis is just one step in my journey.‚Äù*

# 2. Prepare Smarter, Not Harder

* **Simulate Real Test Conditions:** Take timed, adaptive practice tests to build endurance and get used to GMAT dynamics. Take practice tests away from home so you learn to cope with the challenges of a foreign environment. 
* **Optimize Study Techniques:**
   * Use **active recall** and **spaced repetition** to reinforce concepts.
   * Develop **strategic elimination** and **decision-making skills** to work efficiently under pressure.

# 3. Manage Physical & Emotional Stress

* **Mindfulness & Breathing:** Try box breathing‚Äîinhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4.
* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):** Tense and release each muscle group to relieve tension.
* **Exercise & Nutrition:** Prioritize hydration, avoid caffeine overload, and opt for **low-intensity, longer workouts** over short, high-intensity ones.

# 4. Build Confidence Through Small Wins

* **Keep a Success Journal:** After each study session, jot down one thing that went well.
* **Celebrate Progress:** Focus on incremental improvements‚Äîevery step forward counts.

# 5. Stay Calm During the Exam

* Use the **5-4-3-2-1 grounding method:** Name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste.
* Take **one slow breath** before tackling a tough question.
* If overwhelmed, **pause for 30 seconds**‚Äîdoodle, reflect on life, or think about family. A mental reset can bring fresh perspective.

By learning to gauge your anxiety and applying these strategies, you‚Äôll not only manage test stress but also build resilience for future challenges. Remember: Anxiety is just a sign that you care.

# Test Day Game Plan: Stay in Control

**Don‚Äôt Let Anything Affect You.** Your focus is your power‚Äînothing else matters today.

**1. If You‚Äôre Testing at a Center:**

* **Book Smart:** Schedule your exam so you have at least **3 hours after waking up** before heading out.
* **Fuel Right:** Stick to a **bland, reliable breakfast**‚Äî**today is not the day to experiment.** Coffee + slow-release energy foods (bananas, eggs, oats) will keep you steady.
* **Move Your Body:** Go for a run in the morning or do a quick workout to channel that pumped-up energy.
* **Avoid Driving:** Take a cab or have someone drop you off. You don‚Äôt need that extra stress.
* **Arrive 45 Minutes Early:** Find a **quiet spot or a nearby coffee shop** and warm up with **10-15 easy-to-medium Quant & CR questions**‚Äî**don‚Äôt check answers.** The GMAT‚Äôs algorithm makes the first few questions count, so the **exam should not be your first problem of the day.**
* **Ignore the Test Center Drama:** The registration process is **exhausting**, and test center staff can be‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say *power-hungry*. Don‚Äôt let their attitude throw you off. Stay polite, stay detached, and focus on your game.
* **Check Your Setup:** Once at your desk, make sure:
   * Your **wet marker works** and your scratch pad is clean.
   * The **mouse is smooth** (no grit, no lag).
   * The **screen is clear** (no smudges or glare).
   * If they allow **earplugs**, use them.
   * Dress warm‚Äîthe **center will be cold, and anxiety will make it worse.**
* **Pre-Test Breathing:** As you go through instructions, use the extra time before selecting your test order for **breathing exercises**. Bring your **resting heart rate down**‚Äîcalm mind, sharp focus.
* **First Question = Key to Momentum** The first question **sets the tone** for the rest of the exam. Approach it carefully, but don‚Äôt obsess over perfection‚Äîjust **get into your flow.**
* **Stay Locked In:** Ignore distractions. Focus on **one question at a time** and ensure you **complete all sections.**

**2. If You‚Äôre Testing at Home (Online):**

* Same rules apply‚Äîexcept no commute. 
* **Clear your table** and place your **phone behind you.**
* **Ignore proctor drama.** Some of them love to throw their weight around. Don‚Äôt let it get to you‚Äîit‚Äôs not worth it.

Your job? **Stay calm, stay sharp, and execute your plan**

The premise of Liv Pure resonated with me. The idea that liver health plays a crucial role in weight management wasn‚Äôt new, but Liv Pure‚Äôs dual-action approach intrigued me. The supplement promised not just to detoxify the liver but also to enhance fat-burning processes, all while being made from natural ingredients like milk thistle, acai, and other plant-based extracts. With glowing online reviews and a growing reputation in the wellness community, I decided to give it a shot.

First Impressions‚Äã

From the start, Liv Pure impressed me with its professional presentation. The packaging was sleek and secure, and the product information was clear and easy to understand. The capsules were standard-sized, making them easy to swallow, and there was no unpleasant aftertaste‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve encountered with other supplements. The instructions recommended taking two capsules daily with water, preferably with a meal, so I incorporated it into my morning routine for consistency.‚Äã

The First Month: Detox and Adjustments‚Äã

During the first few weeks, I noticed subtle changes. Liv Pure‚Äôs liver detoxification properties seemed to kick in quickly. I felt lighter, and there was a noticeable improvement in my digestion. I used to experience occasional bloating, but this subsided significantly after starting the supplement.

What truly surprised me was the gradual increase in my energy levels. By the end of the first month, I wasn‚Äôt relying on my usual midday coffee to get through the afternoon. I also felt more motivated to stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine, which complemented the supplement‚Äôs effects.

Month Two: Visible Changes‚Äã

As I moved into the second month, the weight loss benefits became more noticeable. I had lost about 6 pounds by the end of this period, and my clothes started fitting better. While I wouldn‚Äôt call this a miracle transformation, it was evident that Liv Pure was helping my body burn fat more efficiently.

What I appreciated most was the balanced approach of the supplement. Unlike some weight loss products that can feel overly aggressive, Liv Pure‚Äôs effects were steady and sustainable. I also felt a stronger sense of overall well-being, which I attribute to the supplement‚Äôs liver-supporting ingredients.

Month Three: Long-Term Benefits‚Äã

By the third month, the results were undeniable. I had lost a total of 12 pounds, and my energy levels were at an all-time high. I felt more active and less fatigued, even after long days at work. My skin also appeared clearer, which I believe is a byproduct of improved liver health.

One unexpected benefit was the impact on my mood. Liv Pure‚Äôs natural composition seemed to contribute to better mental clarity and reduced stress levels. Whether this was due to the supplement itself or the confidence boost from feeling healthier, I can‚Äôt say for sure‚Äîbut the overall effect was remarkable.

Key Features I Loved‚Äã

Natural Ingredients: Knowing that Liv Pure was made with natural components like acai and milk thistle gave me peace of mind. These ingredients are well-known for their detoxifying and antioxidant properties, and they seemed to work harmoniously in this formula.‚Äã

Ease of Use: Taking two capsules a day was simple and didn‚Äôt feel like a chore. The absence of side effects made it easy to incorporate into my daily routine.‚Äã

Holistic Benefits: Beyond weight loss, I noticed improvements in digestion, energy levels, and overall vitality.‚Äã

Science-Backed Approach: The dual-action mechanism of supporting liver health while boosting metabolism felt grounded in science, which gave me confidence in the product.‚Äã

Challenges‚Äã

While my experience with Liv Pure was overwhelmingly positive, there are a few aspects worth noting:

Results May Vary: My husband also tried Liv Pure, but his results were slower. While he did experience better energy levels, his weight loss wasn‚Äôt as pronounced. This underscores that individual results can vary depending on factors like metabolism and lifestyle.‚Äã

Availability: Liv Pure is only available online, which might be inconvenient for those who prefer in-store purchases. Additionally, it‚Äôs important to purchase from the official website to avoid counterfeit products.‚Äã

Cost: While I found the price reasonable for the benefits I received, it might be on the higher side for some. However, the multi-bottle discounts and occasional promotions help offset the cost.‚Äã

Comparison with Other Products‚Äã

Before trying Liv Pure, I had experimented with other liver detox and weight loss supplements, but none delivered the same comprehensive benefits. Many products focus solely on weight loss, often ignoring the role of liver health. Liv Pure‚Äôs unique approach to addressing both aspects felt more holistic and effective.

2.  Coffee grinds are inside the space where the unit came out.  Should I clean those?  how?  is it safe to use a damp cloth in there?

3.  I am using the cleaning tablet the machine came with, this time.  On the KitchenAid site, they offered me a deal on Affresh coffee machine cleaning tablets, which I thought was for this purpose.

I'm working on our order of the day for our UK wedding in late July, it would be great to get any thoughts/feedback.   
  
It's a fairly small wedding - 70 guests - and no evening guests. A mix of outdoor and indoor throughout. Free bar all day! 

A couple of things I'm wondering about:  
  
\- Will 2 hours for cocktails and canapes be too much? We'll be providing 5 canapes per person   
  
\- I'd like to do a cake cutting and a champagne tower, but I'm wondering when best to fit these in.  
  
\- We don't want to do a first dance, but would like \*something\* to kick off the DJ starting - any ideas welcome (could incorporate cake cutting or champagne tower?)  
  
\- At the end of the evening we wanted to do a 90s/00s rave - do you think the timings work? Or does it start too late?   
  
Thank you in advance :)

1ilkmvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1ilkmvh/your_ideal_zombies_game/,Your Ideal Zombies Game,"Howdy, folks.

(I apologize for formatting - I‚Äôm on mobile)

I wanted to present a rather open question: What would your ideal Zombies game look like if resources were no problem?

For context - I played the first iterations of the game to Tranzit, joined the military, did that whole thing for a while, and finally picked up Zombies again last year with MWZ, into now BO6 Zombies. (And of course playing Warzone from 2020 - present)
So forgive me if my knowledge of the game mode is not, well, relevant. 

However, for myself, I am feeling torn on what I find enjoyable again in Zombies. And with now returning to work full time, I find myself day dreaming of what my ‚Äúideal‚Äù zombies mode (or stand alone game) would look like. Feel free to throw in your ideas and criticize mine at the same time! 

For starters: I have enjoyed the added Rarity values along with the Pack a Punch! I would love to incorporate that somehow, while understanding the need for WonderWeapons. 
I have enjoyed Warzone, but don‚Äôt enjoy the ‚ÄúPlating‚Äù system integration with Zombies - I prefer to keep that mechanic to Warzone, personally. However! I have enjoyed MWZ on Urzikstan, with the size and feel of the map, and tiers. BUT! I believe that Zombies is special on its own and should have its own map/theme/feel without just changing some lighting and difficulty tiers to a Warzone map already in use. 

My biggest ‚ÄúLove and Hate‚Äù component for zombies is the community! The Zombies community is full of just absolutely brilliant sleuths who can see a gameplay trailer, or a teaser video, break it down frame by frame, and have a very good understanding of what is expected before a new season drops. (Which I actually believe speaks more negatively about the game and their ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù content and laziness than it does about the community.)

So far my overall thoughts would include: 
     3 large maps loosely based on the Warzone maps we‚Äôve had. 
     A Tranzit like system to get from one map to the next - thinking like, ‚ÄúVerdansk has its own Easter eggs, its own boss to beat, to then to progress to Al Mazrah‚Äù
     With each map, their version of weapons are integrated and can be upgraded with rarity and PaP, but only once you‚Äôve found the requisite parts. Wasn‚Äôt too fond of just completing Tier 3 contracts for 45 minutes and not randomly getting the Epic tool schematic that I was trying to find. 
     Once you‚Äôve completed all 3 maps, then you‚Äôd enter a 4th level of a more zombies styled Dark Aether, where basic weapons are almost useless, unless you can find the requisite parts needed to upgrade - thinking like a MP5 or AMAX at Legendary Pack 3 wouldn‚Äôt always be viable until you‚Äôve turned that particular weapon into its own Wonderweapon. 

But from my admittedly limited experience, I can‚Äôt seem to find that balance that I enjoy between Round Based and Open World/Extraction type experience. 

All in all, the overall design would be with very minimal guidance - it should feel like a year or more worth of Easter Eggs and exploring and profession. One of my biggest qualms is this new kind of ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù feel where CoD introduces a new Dark Aether Rift, or new map, and three hours after the update is live, content creators have already uploaded a, ‚ÄúEasy Step-by-step guide for defeating new Boss‚Äù. 

Okay, I have rambled enough garbled nonsense. Shoot some ideas out there on your dream Zombies game, or criticize mine to hell! Have at it!

This little grinder has been a part of my daily kitchen routine for weeks now, tackling everything from coffee beans to spices like coriander and cinnamon. Its compact, stainless steel design was the first thing that caught my eye‚Äîsleek, modern, and small enough to sit unobtrusively on my countertop.

The build quality feels decent for its price range. The stainless steel grinding blade and body provide a sturdy feel, but the clear plastic lid seems a tad flimsy. I‚Äôve found myself being extra careful with it, especially since aligning the lid properly is crucial to operating the grinder. Durability-wise, I can't yet vouch for how this lid will hold up over time, but it does make me a little nervous.

[**Click here to see the price**](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/amazon-basics-cg9402-ul-review-b07sytrpsg)**.**

The grinding performance, though, is commendable for such an affordable appliance. It‚Äôs fast‚Äîjust ten seconds, and the coffee beans are ground to a fine texture suitable for drip coffee. The grinder also handled spices like cardamom and peppercorns with ease, turning them into a fine powder without leaving behind stubborn chunks. However, I did notice that the grind consistency can vary slightly, especially if you‚Äôre aiming for a coarser grind for French press coffee. While this isn't a dealbreaker for me, it‚Äôs worth noting if you're particular about your coffee texture.

Grinding with this model is simple, but it‚Äôs not without its quirks. Operating the grinder involves pressing down on the lid, which doubles as the power button. It‚Äôs intuitive, but only after you‚Äôve figured out how to align the lid just right. Once you get the hang of it, though, it‚Äôs smooth sailing. The clear lid lets you monitor the grind progress, which is a handy feature, especially if you're experimenting with grind sizes for different brewing methods.

One area where the grinder excels is its versatility. Apart from coffee, I‚Äôve used it for grinding flax seeds, nuts, and even dried herbs. However, the grinding chamber isn‚Äôt removable, which makes cleaning a bit of a hassle. I‚Äôve resorted to wiping it down with a damp cloth for now, but I can see how this might become inconvenient with frequent use or when switching between ingredients with strong smells, like coffee and spices.

Capacity-wise, this grinder is on the smaller side, holding just 30 grams of coffee beans at a time. For me, this works because I usually grind small amounts for immediate use, keeping my coffee fresh. But if you‚Äôre brewing for a crowd, you might find this limiting. Speed, on the other hand, is a strong point‚Äîit‚Äôs impressively quick for its size and power.

One minor annoyance is the messiness of the process. Removing the lid can cause some grounds to spill, and the area where the lid meets the grinder tends to collect debris. I‚Äôve taken to using a small brush to clean these spots, but it‚Äôs not the most convenient solution. That said, the grinder is surprisingly quiet, which is a welcome change from the thunderous roar of other models I‚Äôve tried.

**Pros**

* Compact and sleek stainless steel design
* Fast grinding‚Äîperfect for small quantities
* Versatile for coffee, spices, and seeds
* Quiet operation compared to competitors
* Affordable and accessible for beginners

**Cons**

* Lid alignment can be tricky and feels fragile
* Cleaning is cumbersome due to the non-removable chamber
* Grind consistency could be better for coarser settings
* Small capacity may not suit larger households
* Grounds can get messy around the lid area

**Comparison to Competitors**

When compared to other blade grinders like the Mueller HyperGrind or the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind, the Amazon Basics model holds its own in terms of speed and versatility. However, the Hamilton Beach grinder has a detachable grinding chamber, which makes cleaning far easier. On the other hand, the Mueller HyperGrind offers slightly better grind consistency for a similar price, which might appeal to coffee purists.

This grinder, however, edges out its competitors in terms of noise levels. It‚Äôs notably quieter than the Hamilton Beach model, which can sound like a mini jet engine taking off. If you‚Äôre looking for a grinder that won‚Äôt wake everyone in the house, the Amazon Basics CG9402-UL is a solid choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

For its price range, this grinder offers good value. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it performs well enough for daily use. If you‚Äôre just starting out with grinding your coffee beans or need a budget-friendly option for spices and seeds, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong here. That said, if you‚Äôre willing to spend a bit more, models with better cleaning mechanisms and grind consistency might be worth considering.

Features like the safety lid, compact design, and stainless steel blades make this grinder user-friendly, but it‚Äôs clear that compromises were made to keep costs down. The lack of a removable chamber and the somewhat finicky lid are the most glaring trade-offs. Still, for the price, it‚Äôs a functional and versatile kitchen gadget.

To give some background I primarily drink filter coffee (V60) and use a flair 58. My issue that I am having in my workflow is that I do not like the current workflow of the grinder I have now. I use a DF 64 gen 2 with SSP MP burrs.

The issue that I have in particular is that adjusting grinds between filter and espresso doesn't ""feel good"". Im not sure how to explain it but I am sure someone will understand what I mean (it seems like its metal on metal when adjusting instead of being smooth). My other main complaint with the current grinder is that I do not like having to take off the entire adjustment ring just to clean/swap the burrs out, and often times when I am cleaning/swapping I have to realign the grinder or shim again. I understand that with burr swaps it is common to realign the burrs but I feel I shouldn't have the shim over and over again. What I like about the grinder is the option to switch back and forth no matter how unpleasant the experience is. For someone like me who does both filter and espresso I primarily want clarity and flavor separation, and I am less interested in texture.

If I look at the two grinders mentioned above there are pros and cons that I see. For the Mazzer my primary pro is that the grind adjustment is in a different spot than than opening the grinder to clean/swap the burrs however, the aesthetics of the P64 are much better. I have always been a person that if the product no matter what it is, performs exceptionally I can look past any issues I have in the way that it looks (to an extent).

In general my question is this, is the P 64 worth the large difference in price than the Mazzer Philos? Any help or first hand experience with either would be appreciated!",1,1739123602.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1ilkjui,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1ilkjui/29_m4f_connecticut_new_york_seeking_a_curious/,"29 [M4F] #Connecticut, #New York ‚Äì Seeking a Curious Partner for Conversations, Museums, and 90s Rock Vibes","**About Me:**  
Hi there! I‚Äôm Mike (29M) from Connecticut, and I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone who believes conversations can be little adventures. I‚Äôve always loved learning from people‚Äôs unique stories‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs swapping perspectives, geeking out over random trivia (thanks, museum deep-dives!), or laughing at life‚Äôs beautifully messy moments.

**A Few Things About Me:**

* **Curious & Open-Hearted:**¬†I‚Äôm the guy who asks too many questions (blame my love for mysteries!) and finds joy in small moments‚Äîlike my 5-year-old chihuahua‚Äôs antics or discovering a song that feels like it was written just for me.
* **Hobbies:**¬†Walking in nature, experimenting with new recipes (let‚Äôs trade favorites!), exploring museums, and getting lost in dramas/mysteries (*All Creatures Great and Small*¬†is my latest cozy read).
* **Life Soundtrack:**¬†90s alt-rock (R.E.M., Green Day) singalongs while cooking, because why not dance with a spatula?

**Looking For:**  
A kind, curious partner-in-crime who‚Äôs up for:

* **Thoughtful Chats:**¬†Let‚Äôs dive into big ideas, silly hypotheticals, or stories about your day.
* **Slow Adventures:**¬†Museum trips, aimless walks, or sharing a caf√© table with books (or¬†*very*¬†strong coffee).
* **Authenticity:**¬†I value people who keep it real. Life‚Äôs messy‚Äîlet‚Äôs navigate it with humor and honesty.

**Bonus Points If You:**

* Have a soft spot for 90s playlists or weird historical facts.
* Want to build something meaningful, one conversation at a time.
* Are open to swapping recipes (my pancakes are legendary‚Ä¶ or at least edible).

**My Golden Rule:**  
Every connection is a chance to grow. Whether we‚Äôre debating the best Green Day album or sharing quiet moments, I promise to approach our time with warmth, respect, and an open mind.

**Perfect Day Vision:**  
Homemade breakfast ‚Üí museum wandering ‚Üí getting lost in a book at a caf√© ‚Üí cooking a flavorful meal with 90s rock as our soundtrack.¬†*Maybe*¬†followed by stargazing and trading stories.

**If You‚Äôre Curious‚Ä¶**  
Send me a message! Tell me about your favorite 90s song, a recipe that never fails you, or a place you‚Äôd love to slow-travel to (Spain‚Äôs plazas and Tokyo‚Äôs neon alleys are on my list!). Let‚Äôs start with a conversation and see where it goes.

Looking forward to hearing your story!

*P.S. If you‚Äôve ever butchered a Spanish phrase like ‚Äú¬øD√≥nde est√° la biblioteca?‚Äù‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get along just fine.*

I‚Äôm a French pharmacy student and I am currently writing my thesis on my favorite topic, coffee.¬†

The objective of my project is to assess the effect of coffee consumption on the fatigue felt during the day, and ultimately answer the question: **does coffee really reduce daily fatigue and increase efficacy ?**

HOW : through a daily questionnaire ([CLICK HERE](https://l.instagram.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSeO95Cd38tt-egXMdXM2IEztRlMd0h7MPIT7GF8EYJjGtwQJw%2Fviewform&e=AT2VKYZldM_qvFgmd-xN1Q31GN81t8gXz6E2RTjLBYVEDyGS4ASCfPqPf-jH5-Bh3DKI38M8DzDTmBfo0u1dE3QOB3CuOu9kfA4vQ4GUE9G6j4FZ)) comparing the fatigue felt during a day with coffee vs a day without coffee during 2 to 5 days. The coffee consumption description (type of coffee, volume) is the key point to guess the caffeine concentration.  
‚Äî> For example: an expresso recipe with 18g in/ 36g out has a different caffeine concentration from a V60 12g in/200mL out

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?

You can join if you:

* ÔªøÔªøAre 18 years or older
* ÔªøÔªøAre a student or full-time employee
* ÔªøÔªøRegularly consume coffee
* ÔªøÔªøAre ready to fill out a daily questionnaire at least 2 days straight
* ÔªøÔªøAre not pregnant or menstruating during the study

So I (now 18 F) used to go to drama class with this guy, l‚Äôll call him David (now 19 M) and we were okay friends then, but I quit the drama class in 2022 and haven‚Äôt seen him all the way until August 2024. We bumped into each other at a club, and he had gotten a massive glow up since then. He also flirted with me, which nobody had done to me before (not that I can remember), and it was enough for me to start really liking him that same night. It was my second and his first time at a nightclub, and we instantly fell in love with clubbing, so until college started (in October in Croatia) we went out every weekend with some friends. Two or three weeks later I introduced him to my best friend, I‚Äôll call her Mary (19 F), as sort of a peer review, I just wanted an opinion from her. She didn‚Äôt like him that much, said he was a little fucked up and I could do better. In the meantime I told him I liked him, but he was still not over his last relationship, so nothing came of that, but we remained friends. 

Over time the crush slowly faded, but Mary was slowly showing more interest in him (one time it was just me and her in a club but she kept texting David asking him to come, which my dumbass somehow thought was just in a friendly way). Nothing was really happening between them, so I guess I didn‚Äôt pay attention to it at all. 

Fast forward to my birthday in November. 
Two weeks prior David (who is quite promiscuous, kissed a few different people almost every time we were in the club) asked me if it would be okay with me if he made out with some of my friends on my party, and I said no. 
On the birthday party Mary asked me if, since I used to like him, I was okay with her kissing David, to which I told her no. Firstly because I wanted to avoid stuff like that happening at least for that one night and secondly, she said it herself, the guy‚Äôs not that good (and i was slowly starting to see that too), so I didn‚Äôt understand where did the switch up come from. 
Also, I‚Äôm asexual, and I‚Äôm not very comfortable when talking about sex or witnessing anything that could lead to it (people making out), and my friends all know that. Of course, I can take it if it happens in a club, I‚Äôm aware I can‚Äôt really escape it there, but I thought I wouldn‚Äôt have to explicitly mention to people that I don‚Äôt want to see that on my birthday party.

On the actual party, 20-something people showed up, including David and Mary. I don‚Äôt know if it was the place I was renting and the colorful lighting that made it feel like a night club, or if it was the alcohol, or something third, but one thing led to another and Mary made out with David (they weren‚Äôt actually the only ones doing that but that‚Äôs not as relevant). I got upset because a) people were making out at a birthday party (I don‚Äôt know much but I feel like you just don‚Äôt do that, especially if you know me) and b) they were doing it despite everything I had said beforehand. 

I ran out of the place and a couple of friends came after me, including David. I told him why I was upset and he said that when he asked me if he could make out with my friends it was a joke (???) and then took me aside. One would think he was just going to apologize, but instead he started talking about his ex and something about how he lost her, I don‚Äôt remember, it was cold and I just wanted to go back inside. When we came back in, David was being a crybaby while I tried to have somewhat of a good rest of the night. 

Two days later Mary texted me, we met up and she apologized for the party, said she felt disgusting, and (this is key!) never wanted to see David again and I meant to her so much more than he did. I forgave her instantly because we were friends since literally the first day of high school and I wasn‚Äôt going to let some guy ruin it all just like that.
The next weekend I went to David‚Äôs workplace to talk with him but he didn‚Äôt think he did anything wrong at all and told me I was overreacting, so I quickly gave up on it and decided to stop hanging out with him.
With the rose colored glasses off, another friend who regularly went to the club with us made me realize how awful David actually was: he only ever made out with drunk girls, the friend told me how David tried to have sex with his completely blackout drunk friend twice, and I don‚Äôt even want to imagine what else he did that neither of us know. All in all: I avoided ever speaking to him again.  

A month later, one morning I opened the phone to a bunch of messages from David. He told me that the week prior he was in the club and stumbled upon Mary and another friend, that Mary wanted to dance with him, flirted with him for hours, in the end they made out, and then he sent me pictures of him and Mary kissing that apparently he told the other friend that was with them to take in case Mary tried to bullshit her way out of anything. He also sent me screenshots of a bunch of flirty texts between him and Mary the morning after, and also said that when he asked her ‚ÄúWhat about telling (me) that you never wanted to see me again?‚Äù, Mary answered she ‚Äúhad to make something up otherwise (I) would kill her‚Äù. Which, I would much rather if Mary told me ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôm gonna keep hooking up with David no matter what you say, he‚Äôs hot‚Äù than for her to lie to me like this. 
I simply sent one of the pictures to Mary and then blocked her on everything. 

I didn‚Äôt care who was flirting with whom, was she drunk or no, I don‚Äôt think there is a good excuse for doing that or at least not telling me about it. Only five days before David sent me the photos, I had met up with Mary for coffee because I just wanted to see her, so she had a great opportunity to tell me about it face to face, but she never intended on saying anything. If it weren‚Äôt for the photos, I would honestly hear Mary out on her side of the story, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way they aren‚Äôt real. My friends say I‚Äôm doing the right thing, but my family says I should talk to her and hear what she has to say. Am I being too harsh on Mary or should she stay blocked?

1ilkenz,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1ilkenz/breakup_could_use_some_advicesupport/,Breakup: Could use some advice/support,"

I could use some advice. A girl I‚Äôve been seeing for a few months ended things a few days ago. I‚Äôve been struggling with coming to terms with it as it felt a bit like a fearful decision? Sorry for the length 

TL;DR: She ended things in a way that felt fearful and full of doubt. I‚Äôm not in the business of chasing or trying to convince someone to change their feelings. But wow I really like her, felt like we had something special, and feel like we didn‚Äôt give ourselves a chance. Do I ask to talk more after we process and some feelings settle?

Context: A month into dating we had a conversation that revealed she wanted a family and a long term relationship. I wanted neither of those but we decided to continue seeing each other casually. A little over 3 months in I found myself developing feelings and thinking more deeply about what a family would look like for me. Last week I told her what I‚Äôd been thinking about, that I‚Äôm not completely closed off but it hasn‚Äôt been something I‚Äôve had the opportunity to think about. I also told her I‚Äôd be open to something more serious with her

A few days ago she asked to talk before going on a two week vacation. She told me that she feels we should stop dating, that she thought she would feel something more deeply by now, and that she‚Äôs happy to hear I‚Äôve been reflecting but she‚Äôll open herself up to being hurt too badly if I were to end up not wanting kids (this last one I understand and would never try to convince her to ignore that feeling). If the connection wasn‚Äôt there, though, I feel like I must be the biggest dummy misreading a situation. It feels unfathomable. I asked her if she thinks us being guarded the entire time we‚Äôve been seeing each other could contribute and she smiled, laughed, and said yes probably. 

I told her that me opening up wasn‚Äôt to rush or pressure, it was more info and a bid to let our guards down to see if we could be together. This entire time she was holding my hands, staring into my eyes, hugging and kissing me. I asked her if her mind was 100% made up. She smiled for a second but then said yes as ‚Äúthe ambiguity wouldn‚Äôt serve either of us‚Äù

She also said something like ‚Äúif it‚Äôs meant to be it‚Äôll happen‚Äù which was confusing to me?? She mentioned we could keep casually dating but it isn‚Äôt what she wants. I also don‚Äôt want that, I want more. She also asked if she could text me to check in while she was away and if I had any emotions I wanted to talk through I could call her. And also that there‚Äôs some stuff we could do together when she gets back 

I know breaking up with people you care about is hard and it‚Äôs a flurry of emotions no matter what, but I feel like there‚Äôs a lot left unsaid and I don‚Äôt understand why it had to be so cut and dry? I‚Äôm thinking of setting up a coffee date to talk more and see if there‚Äôs a world where we give it a go

Some of my interests include

I love food.  I like to cook and try new food.  What's the best thing you've tried recently? 

I like to game. How much I game usually depends on my free time. I have a PS5 and lately been into fortnite and marvel rivals.  Recently got into DND and board gaming as well.  

I like to read. Mostly sci Fi and fantasy. 

I also enjoy outdoorsy activities like hiking with our two huskys, foraging and gardening

The idea of them. To the point I had dreams of it. But then in the minutes after it played out in my head...the crush on them was gone. It felt sleazy. It felt eerie. It felt wrong.

Is it correlation to the divorce my parents had? One became a controlling religious zealot, the other cheated with their ex. 

Of the times I've gone against the grain on it, the person politely declined to go out for coffee, or art with both of our friends who are mutuals. So I'd like to believe it's not based on fear of rejection or loathing.

We don't live together yet and since my boyfriend temporarily lives in a one bedroom apartment, he goes to his kid's (ex's) house whenever it's his days with the kids. They get along pretty well and I do too! Which I'm very happy about. We occasionally play board games together, get coffee or eat diner. Which is nice for the kids as well. The kids are 2(F) and 5(M). 

Luckily my boyfriend bought a house, which means the kids will spend their day's at his house. Which also means that I'm going to take on a lot more of a parenting role whenever I'm there. I decided to not move in already, because I want to give the children time to adjust to having two homes and some alone time with their dad. Without me always being there.

But I am a little scared. The 5 year old always blames me. It's actually not that serious, but I'm worried that I will never be able to do it right. This is my first experience with children and I 've grown so much since getting to know them. But I'm still insecure, and the 5 year old never fails to point out what I did wrong. He also always tries to get me to do something wrong. Like, giving false instructions or saying things that are not true. He's lovely and he's not a bad kid at all, I think it's normal behavior for a 5 year old. But it makes me very insecure. He always criticises everything I do. Whenever he drops something, it's my fault etc. One time he tried telling me that I shouldt buckle his sister while in the stroller. Of course I know better, but he insisted and I had to get mad at him. Things like that happen often and I feel like I always have to check with my boyfriend or his mom what to do. 

Yesterday I put him to bed, and he suddenly forgot which toothbrush was his. So I had to ask his mom. We specifically went over all the steps because he tends to add 100 steps whenever someone else puts him to bed. But they forgot to mention that he still wears a diaper at night... I never put him to bed because this was the first time I was alone with him, so I didn't even think of a diaper. So ofcourse he wet the bed last night... I feel soooo bad. I feel so incompetent. His mom told me that he blamed me for everything last night (she said it jokingly), I brushed his teeth wrong, I put on socks (he wanted that), I forgot to pray with him before bed, it was totally my fault that I forgot the diaper, I didn't read the right book (he chose) etc.  

I know he's still a child and I don't resent him or anything, its normal behavior for a child. I don't need advice but I just want to know if it ever gets better. Will I ever feel competent?? So, again, it's totally about my FEELINGS, not his behavior.

1ilk888,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarSalesTraining/comments/1ilk888/dealership_relationship_game_for_newbies/,Dealership Relationship Game For Newbies,"There are new people looking to get into car sales all the time and they come here looking for advice as well.  Everyone does a good job of giving sales advice but I think we sometimes leave out a part that actually makes a big difference.  That aspect of this car game is the political game you have to play and the relationships you MUST create if you're going to really crush it at a dealership. I'll list a few and feel free to add to the list so that newbies are best prepared.

1. Internet/BDC Manager.  This relationship is big because dealerships receive literally thousands of internet leads each month.  The Internet manager has a hand on each one because of the CRM access they have. They are able to sift through the good leads and the crap and pass out the serious inquires to whoever they want.  The dealership also runs email campaigns in the CRM to previous customers who have purchased and those who haven't and whoever responds back alerts the CRM and again the BDC/internet manager does whatever they want.  

1A would be getting in good with a BDC rep.  I've seen guys and ladies bring coffee, food, even sleep with BDC reps who work in the BDC Department and they get fed nice deals but that's a whole other aspect to the dealership life right? lmao

2. The better your relationship with the Sales Managers and GM the better off you'll be.  They pass out leads that are solid.  If you're cool with them you'll have a better shot at doing well.  If you try to avoid them and ""do your own thing"" just because you may not ""click"" or ""vibe"" with them you'll have a much tougher time.

3.  Service Advisors.  They are gonna be a great source for leads because if a customer gets a huge service bill they may just choose to come look at a new or pre owned vehicle instead of dumping money into their current one.  You want to be cool with the Service Advisors so they come grab you when that service customer wants to speak to a sales person about their options.  Now, some may say well the customer may only want to speak to a manager, you're right.  That's when you refer back to #2 and the relationship you need to have with the managers.

\*BONUS\*  Have a great relationship with the head person of the detail department for your dealership.  If you're selling for a dealership there are going to be surveys that customers receive and they will be asked about the condition of their vehicle when they received it and you want them to answer 10/Perfect so you need the Detail department to like you and actually give a shit about the condition of the cars that they send up when they know it's one you've sold.  Also, on busy days like Fri and Sat detail departments can get backed up if lots of cars are being sold and you're gonna want to get your car cleaned up and out of there so you can get it delivered and on to the next customer making money, right?  They may even slide your car in front of some other sales people that they don't know or like and that sales person ends up waiting another 45min to an hr for their sold car to come up.  Again, dealership life, right? 

What do y'all think about the relationships within a dealership and their effect on the ease of your overall success?

Analogy-Genius!!!!!

Physics: The Mechanics of Socializing

Imagine people as particles in a dynamic system. Socializing is the result of forces acting between these particles.
	‚Ä¢	Gravitational Pull: Some people have a strong social gravity‚Äîtheir charisma naturally draws others in, much like massive objects attract smaller ones in space. Extroverts are like stars, pulling planets (people) into their orbit, while introverts might resemble comets‚Äîappearing occasionally but making an impact when they do.
	‚Ä¢	Electromagnetic Forces: Attraction and repulsion govern interactions. You might click with someone instantly due to similar frequencies (shared interests), or feel a repelling force due to conflicting energy (vibes).
	‚Ä¢	Momentum & Inertia: Starting a conversation requires overcoming social inertia‚Äîthe initial awkwardness or hesitation. Once a conversation is in motion, it tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an external force (awkward silence or interruption).
	‚Ä¢	Entropy: Over time, without effort, social energy can disperse into randomness. Think of a lively party gradually mellowing out as people tire‚Äîsystems naturally move toward disorder unless energy (effort) is input to keep them lively.

Chemistry: The Reactions of Socializing

In the chemistry of social interaction, people are like reactive elements combining to form new compounds (relationships).
	‚Ä¢	Catalysts: Some individuals act as social catalysts, speeding up interactions without being consumed by them. They introduce people, start conversations, and keep the reaction going.
	‚Ä¢	Bonding: Friendships and relationships form through different types of bonds:
	‚Ä¢	Ionic bonds (opposites attract) where people complement each other‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses.
	‚Ä¢	Covalent bonds (shared interests) where people share electrons‚Äîcommon goals, hobbies, or values.
	‚Ä¢	Hydrogen bonds (fleeting, light connections) like acquaintances or small talk at a coffee shop.
	‚Ä¢	Chemical Reactions:
	‚Ä¢	Exothermic reactions release energy‚Äîthese are those electric, exciting conversations where everyone leaves energized.
	‚Ä¢	Endothermic reactions absorb energy, leaving participants drained (think of that awkward small talk that feels like pulling teeth).
	‚Ä¢	pH Balance: Every social group has a certain acidity or basicity‚Äîsome environments are toxic (highly acidic), while others are neutral and comfortable. Finding the right balance is key to healthy interactions.

Biology: The Evolution of Socializing

In biology, socializing is an evolutionary trait that ensures survival and reproduction, embedded in the ecosystem of human behavior.
	‚Ä¢	Natural Selection: Social skills evolve as advantageous traits. The ability to cooperate, communicate, and form alliances increases one‚Äôs chances of thriving in the social jungle.
	‚Ä¢	Symbiosis:
	‚Ä¢	Mutualism: Friendships where both parties benefit.
	‚Ä¢	Commensalism: One person benefits, and the other is unaffected (e.g., a mentor-mentee relationship).
	‚Ä¢	Parasitism: Toxic relationships where one person drains the other.
	‚Ä¢	Pheromones & Signals: Humans, like other animals, send out social signals‚Äîbody language, tone of voice, and even subtle chemical cues (like pheromones) influence attraction and connection.
	‚Ä¢	Social Hierarchies: Groups form dominance structures like wolf packs or primate troops. Leaders emerge, roles are established, and alpha and beta dynamics play out in everything from boardrooms to school cafeterias.
	‚Ä¢	Homeostasis: Just like organisms maintain internal balance, people need to regulate social interaction to avoid overstimulation (burnout) or isolation (loneliness).

In essence, socializing is a multi-layered phenomenon:
	‚Ä¢	Physics explains how we interact through forces and motion.
	‚Ä¢	Chemistry dives into why connections form or fizzle through reactions and bonds.
	‚Ä¢	Biology reveals what drives us to connect in the first place‚Äîsurvival, adaptation, and evolution.",1,1739122620.0,Project_Ava,2,1.0,False
1ilk6dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Toastmasters/comments/1ilk6dl/ice_breaker_speech_advice/,Ice Breaker Speech Advice?,"I'm doing my ice breaker at our next TM meeting and I would love a second opinion on my speech. Obviously you can't envision the tone or pauses or anything from this, but I'd love to hear if you guys think this is corny or creative. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!! (some stuff redacted to not reveal too much about my identity lol)



""How do we categorize people? 
By their physical characteristics, economic status, or relationship to other people? By the way they part their hair or whether they say crown or crayon? There are endless ways to put people into box A, B, or C very easily, and sometimes it's beneficial.

Quickly assessing who someone is when you don't know a lot about them can be really useful. Making inferences based on what little information you do have can help you find common ground in a conversation, decide whether or not to tell that risky joke, or predict how they might react to your own hobbies, interests, and dreams.

But no one likes when people make incorrect assumptions. It makes an a-s-s out of -u- and -me-. One morning you stop by Starbucks and decide to get your coworker a drink because you're feeling generous. She mentioned she loves caramel once, so you pick up a caramel macchiato. Except you bring it to her and she's a chocolate mocha girlie through and through. Now she's stuck drinking this drink that she hates because it would be rude not to. On the other hand, people love when you make correct assumptions about them. If you know your coworker is a Swiftie and you decide to play Sabrina Carpenter when you're giving them a ride, they might jam out the whole way home and like you a whole lot more than they did 20 minutes ago.


Since this is my ice-breaker speech, let's describe me and make some assumptions.
I am a married dog owner with no kids. 
I Like Film photography. Baking. Reading. Cold rain. and Oversized clothes.  
I Dislike Sherpa. Coffee. Camping. and Bugs. 
I Value. Empathy. I'm Vegan. Politically left. and I always put my shopping cart back. 

I just fired off 20 descriptors and by this point in my speech you probably have about twice as many in your head just based off the assumptions that you've made about my manner of speaking, body language, and choice of outfit today. I told you I'm vegan and I'm politically left leaning so you might assume that I listen to NPR every morning and drive an electric car. *pause* and you would be right. On the other hand, I told you that I hate camping and bugs so you might assume I hate the outdoors. But I actually love to hike! My husband and I went to Yosemite last year and we hiked the Vernal Falls trail. I think we can all think of a time or two when we were severely misjudged and the isolating feeling that gave you. 

When I first moved to [state I live in] my middle school did A day/B days where you would go to different classes on different days of the week. I'd never been to a school like that. On my second day I went back to gym class, but when the teacher called role, we found out I was in the wrong class and they sent me on my way. I showed up to this 'Career and Technical Education' class about 10 minutes late, so I quietly opened the door, snuck to the side of the room, and then walked along the wall to the back of the room, and took a seat to avoid disturb the class that had already started. The teacher paused. Then said ""I've found that in the front row, we've got the A students. The second row, B students. Third row C students. And the back row.. F students. so come on and move up, F students"". Me and two other kids grab our stuff and move to the middle row. The teacher says 'that's a little better'. He asks me my name and what I wanna be when I grow up. I say 'My name's [my name] and I wanna be a doctor when I grow up"". ""Wow. A doctor. Good thing I moved you out of the F row then, huh. What type of doctor do you wanna be when you grow up? A proctologist?"". Those of you that are old enough for a colonoscopy know what that means. But 11 year old me was not familiar with the term yet. I was already late, I just got called an F student, and I'd been put on the spot in front of a room full of strangers. So I just said 'Sure, yeah'. Then the teacher says 'Do you know what that is? It's a butt doctor."" He just said the word 'butt' in front of middle schoolers, so the entire room erupted into laughter. How dare he! I'd been completely misjudged! From the 5 minute interaction we had, he thought that I was a chronically late flunkie that was pulling his leg by saying I'm gonna be a doctor. Over the course of the semester he had time to get to know me and he eventually realized that his initial assumptions about me were far from the truth. But to be known on a deeper level takes time. If you want to learn everything there is to know about someone, there's no substitute for time spent together.


This fall I spent 7 weeks in [city, state] on a FEMA mission with [my company name] for hurricane Helene. When I came back, my husband picked me up from the airport and told me he had a surprise waiting for me at the house. When we got there, he showed me he had gotten us all new bedding! Pure white, 100% cotton, with a fluffy duvet and four huge new huge pillows. I was in shock. How could he possibly know this would be a gift I'd absolutely cherish? He could have chosen pink and orange striped satin bed sheets with a quilt instead. But we've been together for almost five years, and he knows me so well and he's connected so many things I like and dislike that he was able to make a correct assumption and pick something perfectly tailored to me.


After this speech, you now know me a bit more than you did *checks watch* hopefully between 5 and 7 minutes ago. You have a bunch of new information and new assumptions about who I am. It's been wonderful and terrifying to come up here and tell y'all a little bit about myself. The message I would love for you to take away is that book cover design is a multi-million dollar industry, and books are very strategically designed to have covers that tell you about what type of book is inside and whether you'll enjoy reading it or not. Publishing companies spend a lot of time and money tweaking fonts and color schemes and illustrations to perfectly portray the content inside the book. But really.'Don't judge a book by its cover'. Because sometimes your favorite book ends up being the one you assumed you would hate when you first looked at the cover.""

We've been together for seven years in total and married for a little over two years. We've lived together practically the entire time, and even lived in another country together for about six months. A couple of years ago, I was put in a situation where I had to choose between her and my very religious, conservative, and generally abusive family. I chose her, and she's really been all I have since then. There are so many wonderful things about her, and I wanted to acknowledge that before I address the overload of negative stimulae that led to this post.

Now to the problem. We both think she is autistic, but she hasn't been diagnosed. Whatever it is, it's definitely getting worse. I don't remember it being like this at all until about three or four years ago. She wakes up most days in a great mood, rested, kind, engaged, generally the spitting image of the woman I fell in love with seven years ago. As the day goes on, she just... degrades and changes into a highly volatile human being. It's not exactly every day that it's like this, but it's definitely most days. She says she gets to a point where she gets overstimulated by her day and will just be mad for no reason. Sometimes she'll go to bed early and tell me it's because she feels herself getting mad.

The biggest issue here for our relationship is that during this witching hour, the *smallest thing* will set her off. Sometimes nothing at all will set her off and she finds something that happened in the day to attribute it to retroactively. If I get home from work and I'm tired/in a bad mood, there is almost always something I do, wrong or not, that causes her to blow up.

Last night, that's exactly what happened. I was tired and hungry and had no food in the house after work, and she offered me this frozen rice ball with tuna in it that she got for me from the Asian market. I've never had anything like that before and in the moment it was definitely not what I wanted, and being in the state I was in, I made a face like a petulant child and said ""I'm not eating that shit.""

Was it very rude and not the proper, loving way to say I didn't want that? *Absolutely.* In this particular case I was wrong. Did it merit what happened next? I don't think so. She immediately went into another one of her explosive frenzies and yelled at me until I just shut down and went to the store to grab some quick food. I fed myself and went to bed without speaking to her more, because I know better than to even try during the witching hour.

In the bedroom before I drifted off to sleep, I felt the same emotions I've found myself feeling a lot lately. Frustrated, sad, alone, and just tired. Deeply and profoundly tired. I fell asleep and woke up today without her by my side because she slept on the couch instead of coming to bed, which is an occurrence that is becoming more and more frequent due primarily to what's been happening.

I walked into the living room and she was already awake. We were going to celebrate Valentine's Day early today for scheduling reasons. I was like hey we should talk about last night, because it's important to resolve this so that we can have the nice day that we had planned. It started in a level tone and just ended with us yelling at each other over this my drained reaction to this $2 rice ball. She told me ""you don't listen, you never do nice things for me, etc."" Neither of those things are true and being told that they are just brings back those emotions again.

I went into the other room to have some coffee and I was just sitting in there with the light off, feeling frustrated, sad, alone, and deeply, penetratingly tired. Only I just woke up about 45 minutes ago...

How do I make it stop? Our communication has gotten better recently due to some things we implemented, but I swear this is going to put me into an early grave if it continues. Between what my family did to me and the way the woman I chose over them treats me, I feel like I've lived 100 lifetimes.

I've read this subreddit a lot and I know what the top comment is probably going to be because it's the top comment on like every post here. I don't want to leave her because I still love her deeply. Also, practically speaking we make and have always made a great team. Is there someone here who has a similar type of partner?

1ilk4o8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilk4o8,Rolex Hunting in Greece: How I Scored a One Without a Waitlist,"(The first three pictures are of the Deepsea, and the last three are of the Sea-Dweller.)

I decided to share my experience of how I got my Rolex on my recent trip to Greece. Maybe this will help someone out there who‚Äôs willing to travel without any expectations about what they might find. Just keep in mind, this is my personal experience. While I don‚Äôt think this is the most common way to get a Rolex, I also think it happens more often than people assume.

I had the chance to travel to Greece with my wife this past January, and it was an amazing trip. While I was there, I decided to check out a Rolex AD. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt have any expectations since I have never visited an AD outside the states.¬†

Over the course of a week, I ended up visiting five different ADs in Athens.¬†(Huge thanks to my wonderful wife, who put up with what she considers a boring activity.) At all five places, they treated me well. However, two out of the five really stood out with their service and friendliness. On three, they didn‚Äôt have anything for sale, just different models for display. My wife even joked about how they could afford five employees if they weren‚Äôt selling anything. When I asked about stock, I got the usual response: ""We don‚Äôt have anything in stock... we only get one shipment a month, and we don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre getting."" Two of them told me they don‚Äôt keep a list; it‚Äôs first come, first served. My guess is they were being at least partially honest. Maybe they don‚Äôt keep lists for most models but could for some of the more popular ones.

When I visited the third AD, things started to get interesting. I spotted a Sky-Dweller and a Root Beer in the display. I was standing outside the store with my wife, just admiring the watches, when the owner approached us out of nowhere. He was really polite and casually invited us inside. We agreed, and over the next hour, I had the best conversation I‚Äôve ever had with a salesperson. At some point, he asked me what kind of Rolex I was looking for. He mentioned the Root Beer and Sky-Dweller were both for sale. They both looked great, but I told him I was more interested in the Pepsi model or a Sea-Dweller. He agreed those were tough to get, which I was already well aware of. Just as I was about to leave, he mentioned that he was expecting a Rolex Deepsea delivery either today or tomorrow and asked if I wanted to check it out when it arrived. I agreed, and we exchanged phone numbers. He said he‚Äôd message me when it came in. As I walked out, I couldn‚Äôt help but think about all the stories I‚Äôd read about ADs saying they never know what watches they'll get. So, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to think. A few hours later, he texted me. I told him I‚Äôd stop by the next day since it was getting late and I had dinner plans with my wife.

When I went back to the store the next day, I was pleasantly surprised. I knew the Deepsea was a big watch, and I‚Äôm into larger models, so I was excited to try it on. The first thing I noticed was the weight, it was heavy, but in a good way. It looked great on my wrist, and I seriously considered buying it. But after wearing it for a few minutes, I realized I hadn‚Äôt really thought about the thickness. It was big, not in length, but in thickness. I wasn‚Äôt sure it was the right fit, so I decided to take a day to think it over.

The next day, while sightseeing, I asked my wife if she‚Äôd mind stopping by the last AD on my list, and being the good sport she is, she agreed. When we walked in, the store was pretty empty. I asked the sales associate if she had anything for sale and she mentioned she did have a couple of watches available. Then, just when I thought my day couldn‚Äôt get any better, she said one of the watches was a Sea-Dweller. My heart skipped a beat.¬†I  told her I was definitely interested in seeing it. When she opened the box in front of me, I knew I was going to buy it. It felt perfect on my wrist. The Deepsea is 17.7mm thick, while the Sea-Dweller is 15.2mm. I couldn‚Äôt believe how much of a difference 2.5mm made, it didn‚Äôt feel bulky at all. While I was admiring the watch, the sales associate asked for my thoughts. The only thing I could say was, ""I‚Äôll take it!"" My wife‚Äôs response? ""Just like that? You don‚Äôt even want to think about it?"" LOL.

The rest was easy. We chatted over coffee while they sized the watch and handled the paperwork. Since I‚Äôm not a Greek citizen, I had to fill out some extra forms to get the VAT refund. For those who don‚Äôt know, one of the best parts about buying a watch in Europe (and some Asian markets) is that you can get the VAT refunded. In my case, I saved over ‚Ç¨2,600.

All in all, it was an incredible experience. The customer service was top-notch, and I never imagined I‚Äôd end up buying a Rolex while on vacation. I‚Äôm not sure if my experience was the norm or an exception, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs had this kind of luck. Best of luck to all of you!

I'm trying to process this a bit more as a kid when my dad was done making a cup of tea/coffee he'd put the hot teaspoon he'd used to take the tea bag out, stir etc on the back mine and his partners necks. Has happened fro as long as I can remember till about me being 18 (I was born in '97)

This feels like it was abuse, but mum who was divorced as long as I could remember asked if he still did ""the spoon thing"" and laughed about it.

1ilk34i,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1ilk34i/help/,Help,"I just want to start by saying I get how hard addiction is. It‚Äôs a huge struggle, and I have a lot of respect for anyone genuinely trying to overcome it. But I also believe that with real effort and the right support, it can be done.

I‚Äôve been married for over five years, and my husband has had a severe porn addiction our entire marriage. He started struggling with it when he was eight, and despite therapy, there‚Äôs been little to no improvement. It‚Äôs been rough, full of dishonesty and manipulation, and honestly, I‚Äôm exhausted.

We‚Äôve done the whole supportive thing. I‚Äôve been VERY supportive & loving and understanding. I‚Äôve listened & held him while he cried & he gives me updates when I ask. His therapist said he scored because most women aren‚Äôt as positive & loving about this kind of thing. But despite everything, there‚Äôs no change. 

What really gets me is how the church handles it. Scripture makes it very clear that porn is a sin, yet the church barely does anything about it. As long as the men are ‚Äútrying,‚Äù they can still go to the temple, take the sacrament, and wear the garment‚Äîno real consequences. Oh, and are still worthy to use the priesthood. But coffee? That‚Äôs a hard stop? That just feels so backwards.

Meanwhile, wives like me are left to deal with all the pain and betrayal that comes with a spouse‚Äôs sexual addiction‚Äîan addiction that affects everyone around them. We‚Äôve tried the 12-step program, had countless meetings with bishops across different wards, and there‚Äôs been no real plan of action. I was literally told that if they didn‚Äôt allow men with this issue into the temple, almost no one would be able to go. And I‚Äôm just supposed to accept that? Of course no one‚Äôs going to try that hard if they can just get away with it.

It also breaks my heart that this isn‚Äôt new. Even in scripture, women have had to suffer through this‚Äîwatching their husbands cheat, visit brothels, chase after other women, even start whole new religions just so they could leave their wives. And now, we‚Äôre still expected to just endure it? I‚Äôm so tired of it.

And I‚Äôm over the same empty responses: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll answer for it on Judgment Day.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust pray about it.‚Äù Trust me, I have prayed. A lot. And I‚Äôm not getting any answers.

If anyone else has been through something similar and has any words of comfort, I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

P. S. To clarify, I love my husband. I really, truly do. I would have left a LONG time ago if I didn‚Äôt. This battle is worth fighting. He‚Äôs a good man. Imperfect, but truly good. I‚Äôm just tired of being hurt in the same way over and over. ",3,1739122378.0,latterdaysaints,3,0.8,False

1ilk0y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1ilk0y2/making_childfree_friends_in_real_life/,Making Childfree Friends In Real Life,"**Note:** This started as a comment on another thread, but I got some interest, so I'm making a full post of it. Also, I want to make it clear that I have no financial stake in Meetup or any other apps. They are simply a means to an end.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

We could all use more childfree friends. Unfortunately, there's not many third places these days, and wearing an ""Ask me about my reproductive choices"" t-shirt can invite drama and bingos. 

So what does that leave? Trawling the waiting rooms of urologists and OB-GYNs to find people getting sterilized? Possibly not the best idea.

My solution: Use Meetup. First, look for a childfree group already in your area. If so, you can stop reading the rest of this. Go make friends.

If there isn't an existing group, and event organizing isn't your forte, then use the following steps to set up a childfree group in your area, and starting doing fun stuff and making friends.

**Steps:**

**1) Get on Meetup.** You'll need both the regular Meetup app, and the Meetup Organizer App, and to make an account. 

Note: As the organizer, you'll have to pay a subscription fee to operate a group. I consider this an investment in making new friends. If this is an obstacle, try connecting with another group, maybe one for singles, and ask if they can sponsor you, or if they'd be willing to create some events clearly labeled for your audience (I did this once in a place I used to live when I wanted to get a karaoke group started). An Organizer can have up to 3 separate groups on one subscription.

**2) Come up with a name for your group.** It doesn't have to be clever. Simply calling it ""Childfree Adults of \[your location\]"" will work. I saw one in another city called ""Childfree Adults Social Club"". It's simple, it gets the point across, and immediately sparks the interest of your target audience.

**3) Write a blurb describing the group.** Just a paragraph expanding on the title and what you're aiming to do. You don't need to commission a team of monkeys on typewriters for this, feel free to copy my example word for word:  ""*Building new friendships can be challenging if you don‚Äôt have or want children - so let‚Äôs simplify it! People of all genders and orientations are welcome. Our activities range from grabbing coffee or drinks to game nights, trivia, hikes, book discussions, and social gatherings - all without the need for a babysitter.""*

**4) Start planning some events.** Make the first one at least a couple of weeks out, to give people time to find your group's page. **Start off with some place/activity you would enjoy going to alone, just in case no one shows up.** Example: Just having a few drinks/coffees (bring a book or a hobby like cross-stitch if you're into that), pub trivia, hanging out at a park. Try to have at least 3 or 4 events on the calendar, but don't swamp your schedule. For something like a hike, make sure to start promptly out of respect for the people that bothered to show up on time. 

Notes: Give people a way to find you at the event (Example ""I'll be at the table in the back, wearing a banana suit"") // If someone gives you the creeps, don't feel bad about banning them. // It's up to you whether you want to include empty nesters. I made the snap decision to allow it, when an attendee mentioned that was her status. Eventually it may bite me in the ass somehow, but I'm not worried about it right now.

**5) Persevere and manage your expectations.** If 20 people join the group on the app, 5 will RSVP to an event, and of those, 2-3 will show up. Just be patient, and don't concern yourself with those that don't show up.

1ilk0fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ilk0fj/theres_a_walking_bioweapon_in_our_local_police/,There's a walking bioweapon in our local police station's drunk tank. It got out.,"A, I assume, very confused woman called in what would likely become a drunken disorderly charge just after midnight. She told the county police department that a ‚Äúfreak in a bdsm suit‚Äù staggered out of the forest and passed out next to her front gate. My coworkers picked short straws and Tyler lost, so was sent to pick this freak up. 

I was busy filing paperwork when they brought him in, and turned on a little music to try and drown out the commotion. Eventually, Tyler staggered into my office. 

‚ÄúChief, come look at this weirdo.‚Äù He said, before ducking back out. 

I sighed, leaning back in my chair. Tyler was a good deputy, but he had the maturity of a high schooler sometimes. I capped my pen, wiped the ink smudges off my fingers with a tissue, and stood up, my knees popping in protest. The office was cramped, barely big enough for the desk and filing cabinet, and I had to sidestep a precarious stack of case files to get to the door. 
 
I walked through the lobby and unlocked the door which led to the holding cells. I saw a group of just about everyone who isn't on patrol at the time crowded around the door to the drunk tank. There was a low buzz of conversation, occasionally pierced by a burst of laughter. I elbowed past them to the front, where Clarice was filming the guy with her phone. 

I was about to tell her to knock it off when I actually got a good look at him.  

At first, I thought Tyler had been exaggerating. He wasn‚Äôt. The man slumped against the back wall of the holding cell looked like something from a grainy video nasty. His outfit,  if you could call it that, was a skintight, jet-black suit that covered everything. No zippers, no seams, no indication of how the hell he got into it. It had a weird sheen under the flickering fluorescent lights, which made me guess it was latex. His arms ended in stumps. 

There was a polished, metal circle attached to the face of the suit approximately where the mouth should've been. At first, I thought two eye holes had been cut in the material. Looking closer, I realised that they were spaced too far apart, with the left one being elevated ever so slightly more than the right one. 

‚ÄúTyler,‚Äù I turned to my deputy, ‚Äúdid you get a good look at his eyes? Dilated pupils?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, those aren't his eyes. No, they're fake. Old prosthetics I think. Enamel.‚Äù replied Tyler.

Clarice kept filming.  

I sighed, rubbing the bridge of my nose. ‚ÄúClarice, put the damn phone away.‚Äù  

She huffed but did as she was told. The rest of the staff muttered amongst themselves, shifting uncomfortably.  No one was more uncomfortable than Jack. Old Jack spends more nights in that drunk tank that he does at home. That's probably his aim. This night, he was reported howling at women younger than his daughter, and was picked up staggering down Main Street rattling his empty bottle of homemade gin against the lampposts. 

Now he was curled up in a ball in the corner of the cell, sitting in a puddle of his own piss while swearing in Spanish at the latex man. 

I turned to Tyler. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you find this guy?‚Äù  

‚ÄúNear the Banks house, you know, where the maggot farm murders took place in the 90s? He was face-down in the dirt, completely out of it.‚Äù Tyler crossed his arms. ‚ÄúWe tried talking to him, but he hasn‚Äôt said a word. Thought he was on something.‚Äù  

I glanced back at the guy. His chest rose and fell slowly. ‚ÄúYou searched him?‚Äù  

Tyler shook his head. ‚ÄúNo pockets.‚Äù  

I sighed. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs process him, see if we can get an ID.‚Äù  

Tyler gave me a ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the boss‚Äô shrug and grabbed the keys off his belt. He stepped toward the cell and‚Ä¶ and the man moved.

Not much. Just a twitch. A slight tilt of the head. When I looked at him again, he was staring right at me with his porcelain eyes. Old Jack whimpered and Tyler looked back at me. I gave him a nod that told him to keep going. 


Then he stood up. 

He looked inebriated. He found his unsure footing and stood to look at us, then back at Jack, then to us again. His suit squealed with each movement. Clarice let out a choked gasp as he lumbered towards the door. 
I felt a sudden, unbearable pressure in my skull, like an icepick was being driven through my forehead. I bent double, hands on my head, and groaned like a pained cat. 

At first, I thought I was feeling the beginnings of a cluster headache. I've suffered from them since childhood, and spent most of my life trying to articulate how painful they are to friends and family, and employers. They are the only comparison to what I felt in that moment. Then, I looked up and saw that the dozen people around me were reeling from the same such pain.

Then, in a voice that was neither deep nor high, neither man nor woman, the figure finally spoke.  

Where am I?

With those words, the pain ended. The thing‚Äôs words rang hollow in my mind, and, I'm sure,  in the minds of the staff who surrounded me. I slowly collected myself and stood up straight, facing the thing in the cell. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the county sheriff‚Äôs office,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

The thing tilted his head down, considering the question. It seemed to stare at its fingerless hands before answering. 

I do not know, it said. The voice wasn't muffled. 

I exchanged a nervous glance with Tyler.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said slowly, trying to keep things calm. ‚ÄúHow about you tell us what you do remember? How‚Äôd you end up where you did tonight? 

The thing brought its latex mittens to its face, stroking its own cheeks.

I remember... darkness. A great weight. Then... freedom. But not mine, It communicated

Its words were like tin, and I continued to hear them longer than I should've. It was clear to me now that it wasn't speaking. We were hearing its thoughts.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I continued carefully. ‚ÄúDo you have a name? Anything we can call you?‚Äù

Aleph, it answered in an aggressive tone. 

It took a step back, and then another. It stood in the center of the cell, surveying us. From behind him, Old Jack whispered something to himself about the devil, and spat on the concrete floor. Slowly, Aleph turned to face him. Jack looked startled, but his intoxicated rambling continued. He stopped mid-sentence while swearing to God, and began to splutter and wheeze. 

‚ÄúJack,‚Äù I called, grabbing the wheel of keys from Tyler, ‚ÄúJack, stay calm. I'm coming in.‚Äù

As I fiddled with the lock, my coworkers around me gasped. I looked up to see Jack slowly rising, his back grinding against the wall behind him. He clawed at his throat as he fought for one more breath. Aleph stood and watched his dying agony, silently content. Jack was standing on the tips of his shoes now and then, nothing. As he was suspended in midair, hung from an invisible noose, the door to the cell clicked open. 

Jack's body crumpled to the floor and the latex man rotated, facing me once again. Before I could issue a warning, it began to glide across the floor. Startled, I reached instinctively for the gun in my holster. As I did, my arm snapped forward at the elbow, shattering the joint. As Jack had done, I fell to the floor, clutching the bulging, splintered bone just under the skin. 

Pathetically, I started to cry as I watched the man in latex float past through the door. My deputy and close friend for a decade, Tyler, drew his pistol and leveled it at that thing's head. I watched helplessly as his hands moved backwards, clearly out of his control. Tears welled in his eyes and he pleaded as he pressed the barrel against his forehead. I could see that he was trying to fight it, but it was useless. The gunshot was deafening. 

I woke up an unknowable amount of time later. I staggered to my fight, holding onto the bars for support. I realised that I had passed out from the pain, but my arm still throbbed like a second heartbeat. I picked up my fallen gun and slid it back into my holster. I looked around and saw my colleagues. They were scattered on the hall's floor. Slowly, I made my way out of the cell. The bodies that surrounded me looked like they had been run-over. Crushed. I tried to look at the ceiling as I walked over them, feeling the remains separate with each step. It was like walking through mud. Finally, I broke free into the main hallway. 

It was a nightmare. The fluorescent lights flickered erratically, casting jagged shadows over the crumpled forms of my colleagues. The air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid smell of burnt gunpowder. My shattered arm hung uselessly at my side, each step sending waves of nauseating pain through my body. I clenched my teeth, forcing myself to keep moving. I had to get out. I had to find help.  

But as I stumbled toward the lobby, I realised something was wrong. The station was silent. No radios crackling, no phones ringing, no casual conversation between work friends. Just the faint buzz of the dying lights and the occasional drip of blood hitting the floor.  

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù

More silence. 

I pushed through the door to the lobby, and my heart sank. The front desk was overturned. Papers and broken equipment scattered across the floor. The windows were intact, but the world outside was... wrong. The streetlights were dim, their glow muted and hazy, as if the light itself was being swallowed by the darkness. The trees beyond the parking lot swayed unnaturally, and gradually drained into the darkness beyond them like a wet, watercolor painting. 

And then I saw it.  

Aleph was standing in the middle of the parking lot, its back to me. It was perfectly still, its glossy suit reflecting the faint light in distorted patterns. I froze, my hand instinctively going to my holster, but I stopped myself. I couldn‚Äôt risk it. Not after what had happened to Tyler. 

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I said, my voice steadier than I felt.

I'd limped out into the tarmac of the parking lot now, just yards away from Aleph. When I spoke, it slowly turned around. I saw that it was desperately trying to open the metal hatch over its mouth. Defeated, it lowered its arms back down to its side. 

I'm dreaming, it said. The words slithered into my skull like a snake, wet and oily. 

In my periphery, I could see the night sky lower itself. The darkness spread, and seemed to move like a sandstorm. Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my heart. My knees buckled and I fell to the floor, clutching my chest. When I looked back up, I saw nothing. True nothing. Surrounding me was the void. It went on forever in every conceivable direction. The only two things in this universe were me and Aleph.

‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù I said between rasping breaths, ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù

It is me, replied Aleph. After a short eternity of silence, it spoke again. 

I need to find the other dreamers. 

The silence of the void wasn‚Äôt silent at all.  
It was a low, insectile hum, vibrating in my molars, and in the marrow of my shattered arm. Aleph stood before me, his porcelain eyes reflecting nothing and everything. A void in a void. His mittened hand hovered inches from my face, the black latex glistening like the carapace of some deep-sea fish. I tried to speak, to scream, but my tongue sat dead in my mouth.  

Then the sirens came.  

Not from outside, but from all around. A shrill, electronic wail that seemed to peel the darkness itself into ribbons. Aleph‚Äôs head snapped upward, his metal mouthpiece emitting a sound like a detuned radio. The void shuddered, reality folding like wet paper, and suddenly I was on my back on cracked asphalt. The parking lot‚Äôs yellowed overhead lights buzzed and flickered. My broken arm pulsed in time with them.  

The SUVs arrived in a synchronized swarm, black and sleek like a posse of hearses. They skidded into formation, boxing us in with military precision. Doors flew open. Men in charcoal-gray suits spilled out, their faces obscured by gas masks tinted amber. Their gloves were thick and rubbery, with the same unsettling sheen as Aleph‚Äôs suit.

Aleph didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt say anything. 

All around me, I heard men's voices barking orders into radios, and receiving them two-fold. The agents raised devices that looked like overgrown tasers, their prongs crackling with blue current. Aleph‚Äôs head tilted, almost curious. Then he raised his stumped arm.  

The nearest SUV levitated.  

Not dramatically. Not like movie magic. It's just‚Ä¶ unweighted, tires spinning lazily as it drifted six feet off the ground. The agents froze. One muttered into his comms, voice tinny through the mask: ‚ÄúAsset is active, I repeat, the asset is-

Aleph snapped his arm back down to its side.  

The SUV crumpled like a beer can, windshield exploding in a diamond spray. It hung there, a mangled sculpture, before crashing down. Agents dove clear, but one wasn‚Äôt fast enough. The chassis pinned his legs, his scream muffled by the mask.  

Chaos erupted. Tasers fired, arcs of blue lighting the dark. The currents struck Aleph, and wriggled around him like neon snakes. They had little effect on it.

Two agents collided midair, bones crunching.  

I scrambled backward, gravel biting my palms. That‚Äôs when I saw him. A man in a cream-colored trench coat, untouched by the bedlam. He clutched a white rabbit, its fur carefully dyed red. The creature‚Äôs nose twitched, its eyes wide and alive.  

‚ÄúAleph!‚Äù the man called, his voice a reedy monotone.  

Aleph froze. A suited man collapsed from the air, mid-vivisection, and the tension that blanketed the area dissipated like a deflating balloon. Aleph turned, slow and jerky, toward the rabbit.  

The trench-coated man stepped forward, extending the animal like an offering. Aleph reached for it needly, its mitts trembling. When it touched the rabbit, the red dye smeared onto its latex, spreading in uneven streaks. The creature didn‚Äôt struggle. It just stared, its breathing rapid but steady.  

The man in the trench coat smiled. It didn‚Äôt touch his eyes.  

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúBack to the garden, little king.‚Äù  

Then he drew a pistol from his coat, an unremarkable, modern handgun. He put a consoling hand on Aleph‚Äôs shoulder and walked behind it. He flicked the safety off the pistol and pressed it against the back of Aleph‚Äôs head as it lovingly cradled the rabbit like a newborn.

The gunshot was deafening.  

Aleph didn‚Äôt collapse dramatically. It just slumped, like a marionette with its strings cut. Its suit lost its sheen, turning dull and lifeless. The porcelain eyes stared blankly at nothing.  No blood poured from the wound. The trench-coated man knelt, carefully taking the rabbit back into his hands. He touched Aleph‚Äôs face and whispered something. 

Medics rushed to my side, their gloves cold as they strapped me to a stretcher. I didn‚Äôt take my eyes off Aleph. His body lay motionless, the latex suit now just a strange, empty shell. The man in the trench coat watched as agents began loading Aleph into a black body bag. He glanced at me, his expression unreadable.  

Soon after, I passed out from exhaustion. The last thing I remembered was being carried into the back of a van. When I did finally wake, I was laying on my own sofa, in my own living room, in my own house. I sat up, disoriented, and almost had a heart attack when someone spoke from just behind me. I turned to see the man in the trench coat sitting across from me. 

We spoke briefly and he leaned across my coffee table to hand me a pen and a clipboard. Attached to it was a lengthy form that he told me to sign. It was a non-disclosure agreement. I asked him what would happen if I didn't, and he just stared at me. Eventually, I reluctantly picked up the pen and wrote my signature on the dotted line. The man in the trench coat cracked a smile and stood up, patting me on the shoulder. He told me that he'd be in touch, and calmly strolled out of my home. 

He never did get in touch again. 

The feds swarmed the ruined police station like flies on shit. I, of course, was the last to be told what they were doing. The story that covered the local news broadcast for a few weeks was that a gang had shot the place up. Yet another unfortunate battle lost in the war against drugs. 

I had a teenaged daughter and a beautiful wife at the time, and all I wanted was to keep my head down. I took early retirement and tried to keep away from the press. Eventually, they stopped caring. See, this all took place in 2009. Since then, my daughter has grown up to follow in my wake, and is now the town's sheriff. I've kept myself to myself, never telling anyone about that night. I live a quiet life now, and enjoy my retirement. But a few weeks ago, I began to have dreams. 

Not since I was a young boy could I remember my dream. They'd manifest as the tiniest sliver of memory, if anything. At the start of this year, my dream became so, so vivid. It‚Äôs almost painful. Each night since I've had the same dream of a red rabbit, trying to lead me deep into the forest. Tonight, I think I'll try to follow it.

ROGUE-FP is a modern take on old school traditional roguelikes.

If you ever thought you might like to play some of the classic older roguelikes like Rogue itself, Angband, or Nethack but thought the controls were too complicated or they were too hard to get into, then ROGUE-FP may be right up your alley.

ROGUE-FP takes the mechanics of those games and faithfully recreates them in first person while retaining their feel. There‚Äôs no movement grid to slow you down, and their turn based gameplay lives on in ROGUE-FP‚Äôs smooth turn system.



**It has all of the classic trappings**:

* Procedurally generated dungeons
* Lots of traps
* Lots of monsters -especially emus
* Lots of items -/potions, scrolls, wands, rings, weapons, armors, monster bits
* Lots of life or death situations to get yourself into
* One Amulet of Yendor

**But it also has QoL stuff like:**

* Smooth turn system that‚Äôs based around time rather than strict turns
* Modern first person controls
* Difficulty settings
* Simple, quick tutorial
* Ultrawide monitor support



The game also features a *Classic Mode* that painstakingly recreates the original Rogue in this style down to exact floor generation methods and monster behaviors.



**The games** ***Standard Mod*****e has many features of its own such as:**

* Larger dungeon floors
* Environmental hazards -pits, ice, etc
* Configurable armor based on the monsters you kill
* Gas traps
* Explosive monsters
* A gold pile that collects all of the gold you‚Äôve gotten through out all of your runs



ROGUE-FP is what is called a coffee-break roguelike, which means if you have a successful run it would take you somewhere around 30-40 minutes to win. That's a big IF though.

I put out an update for ROGUE-FP about once a month so it is **still getting more features and support** and so that 30-40 minutes may go up or down depending on new monsters and mechanics.",0,1739122162.0,Games,0,0.3,False

I started Ozempic around the very end of October. I have lost about 18 pounds. I would hardly call that rapid weight loss. I have no other side effects whatsoever and I‚Äôm very happy with the medication.

However, in the last few days, I have noticed, I don‚Äôt like the way my hair looks, and I didn‚Äôt realize until I went to get my hair done that it was thinning. I already wear a very short hair style. I eat tons of protein I take collagen supplements. I have not eliminated fats from my diet at all ,and I don‚Äôt wash my hair more than a few times a week.

Obviously, this is very upsetting. Even though my hair was short, it was healthy and full.

I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm welcoming suggestions. Obviously it is the medication and not the fact that I‚Äôve lost 6 pounds a month. I don‚Äôt starve myself at all on Ozempic. It has simply eliminated the cravings for sugar and junk, but I still eat a good healthy diet.

Yesterday I went over to the Aveda salon, and I bought their entire line of products for thinning hair. I don‚Äôt know what else to do.

If anyone has experience the same under the same circumstances, please I will be grateful for your sharing of information. TIA.

I will also add that all of my labs are perfectly normal.

We can‚Äôt control the actions of others. 
We only control our own behaviors and actions.

1iljlpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1iljlpo/one_month_caffeine_free/,One Month Caffeine Free,"Here are my impressions after one month without brown drug: 

1. The EASIEST phase for me was first 3-4 days which google advertising as the worst. Yes, I had headaches but in a big scheme of things this was totally sufferable. Plus, there was something to look forward to later in the evening - Motrin. It provided relief we all are looking for in the end of the day regardless of whether we have headache or not. My sleep was deep and restful. 

2. First week was overall the easiest I had since quitting. Probably the old stores of dopamine were not depleted yet or my body was going on autopilot even though the drug had been removed. 

3. Weeks 2-3 are when the shit started hitting the fan. Headaches were mostly gone-gone leaving a dull throb here and there. Hardly noticeable. However my background stress levels at rest shifted from definition of ‚Äúcalm‚Äù to ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù. This I capture with my fitness tracker (Apple Watch). Prior to quit, if I rest at home, my stress levels were calculated as calm all the time. After caffeine quit, I did not see my stress at calm. ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù became my new ‚Äúcalm‚Äù. I started waking up more at night. Had a few panic attacks. My HRV from 40 went down sometimes to 4! My heart rate elevated. My respiratory rate more frequent. My temperature elevated. 
Also, a string of huge stressors (not connected with my caffeine free new life) suddenly hit me during day hours during week 3. I lived in the blur. 
During these two weeks I noticed that I do not have heart palpitations anymore at work even when it is very stressful. The string of unusual high stresses that hit me during week 3, did not affect me the way it would if I were consuming coffee. I did not lose it. I kept mobilised and handled it all well. Still, a part of me thinks I would not be tested with these highly concentrated and totally random stresses if I were drinking coffee. It felt like a test. So far, I consider it the most challenging part of my caffeine free journey. 

4. Weeks 4+. Got used to a daily newly elevated stress which life had been giving to me since my third week. Suddenly got couple of cases of good luck (also random, not connected to my actions). Realised that I do not remember since when I was just lucky without any work on my part! Wow. I am still digesting sudden luck and very grateful. It hints that life can have some mercy. Two people approach me at work at different times and complimented me on weight loss, age loss, and glowing skin. I started seeing that periodically I do go into ‚Äúcalm‚Äù state now. Still ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù stress prevails my rest but here and there I started seeing ‚Äúcalm‚Äù again. I had my first craving for caffeine today!!! I had a short panic - I needed a boost! Maybe it is connected to my ‚Äúcalm‚Äù state which I did not experience for three weeks and it is uncomfortable to me now. 

Overall, it is not a piece of cake (unless someone is masking all this with another drug). However I know - I am not going back to the brown drug! I came out of denial and understood one thing - caffeine intake is like whipping a horse. If I need to whip my horse, I will take a cold shower! 

To those who are in the beginning of this journey - keep going! You are moving towards health away from sickness. 

One thing I started noticing are people faces in the grocery stores. I clearly see addicted person vs sober. I find sober people immensely attractive. Just seeing them makes me happy. When I go to the forest and lucky to see a fox or heron or hawk, I am happy. I often wondered why I am not happy when I see people? Now. I think, I know why. Because most of people are walking addicts while animals are sober. Now when I am able to see sober people, I discover I like them the same way I like the fix in the forest!

1iljg86,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanic/comments/1iljg86/i_finally_understand_how_cold_the_water_was/,I finally understand how cold the water was.,"My hot water heater broke earlier this week and we had to replace it. I live in NYC which gets its water from the reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains upstate. Cold NYC piped water on average is 55 degrees. In winter NYC water goes down 10 degrees farenheit to 45 degrees (7.2 celsius). This water is essentially mostly recently melted snow and ice water. I had a 10 hour shift of work and NEEDED a shower to get through it after a day or so of going without, so I really told myself I was going to tough it out. I made this mental plan of putting shampoo over myself and then just washing it off. So I turned it on and stepped into the tub. My feet were the first to get in, numb from the start. The hardest part was getting my torso and head under the showerhead. Which I, 24 YO M, audibly yelped from the shock and numbing cold. I just kept telling myself ""get it done, keep going, you need to get clean."" 3 minutes in I was hyperventillating, basically uncontrollably. I was shivering and taking deep inhales. A minute later I stepped out. I've never remembered seeing myself look bluish like that before. I covered myself into a warm towel before getting dressed, making a cup of coffee, and sitting near a heater. It's horrifying that the ocean was still even colder than that, and that being saltwater, it stayed as a liquid. I feel an even greater respect that the victims tried to fight for their lives even through such dire situations. The 1997 movie shows that man panicking and trying to use Rose as a life raft, and Cameron tries to make us hate him, but that guy literally was essentially near death, his organs were shutting down at that point so I think the movie could have been more sympathetic than making there a bad guy (dying man) and the good guy (Jack punching a hypothermic man in the process of dying). Not saying drowning Rose was cool, but why did they need a scene like that, to make it seem like he was intentionally doing it and not in a fight for self preservation?

Would something like this have a strong negative effect or is it not that unusual? That's my main question.

Additional context:

I take 100 mg of trazodone for insomnia and fall asleep in about 20 minutes each night. I sleep 8 to 10 hours most nights. I have sleep apnea, treated with a CPAP. My AHI hovers around 1 to 2 each night. I drink 1 cup of coffee right when I wake up in the morning. Not sure how it would be relevant but the only other medical thing I use is an albuterol inhaler, which I don't use particularly often but at least once or twice a day, one or two puffs. 

I'm sleeping alright but I'd say my own evaluation of my quality of sleep would be like, 80% of the way to being normal. Whether it's the waking up to go the bathroom or my sleep apnea, I definitely don't feel like my quality of sleep is ideal, which is why I drink coffee.

1iljek1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1iljek1/even_my_passion_for_making_art_is_too_much/,Even my passion for making art is too much - exhausted all the time,"I identify as a 'creative person', an artist, etc. I don't know what else I could identify as. It's the only thing I seem to be good at AND enjoy. But I am extremely unproductive with it. 

My art is the only thing that seems to stop that monster of existential dread from gnawing in my chest at night. Before I started finding some time for my stories and music, I honestly used to wake up with my heart racing and feeling this horror, with the thought that I would die having never done anything with my creativity/ideas/artistic potential, and it was horrible. 

As I was lying on the chair earlier falling asleep because I was so tired (only having hoovered, cleaned some surfaces and cooked a meal), I realised I could go my entire life not singing, not writing songs, not writing anything more for my worldbuilding or story. And I would be mostly okay (I think?). Or rather I could go on not pursuing those activities and disciplining myself to try to do them every now and then (as I currently do). Honestly I could do nothing and still find it too much. I went like that through all my childhood and teenhood. Putting off my passions. Masking of course too. But even now that I'm masking less, in a safer environment and I'm lucky I don't have to work right now, I don't feel a massive increase in energy compared to then. I'm confused as to why. And I know this is not how books get written. It's not how EPs/albums get produced and mixed and, ahem, finished. I know that. Knowing that just makes it worse. I just wish I had infinite time to do everything I want to do with my art!!

I used to be mostly motivated to create because I wanted to 'change the world', make a difference, impact people. I was young. But in the last few years, I've been in a much safer and healthier environment, and I have been finding joy mostly in the process, and being mindful and present in nature. I care less about making a mark or being remembered now. Sure, it'd be nice. But I am coming more to terms with my meaninglessness as a speck of flesh on this ball of rock in space. And yet, still, my lack of energy persists.

I have some bursts of energy in the week, but it's always followed by exhaustion, so any momentum doesn't last long-term. Coffee helps, but it doesn't help my bladder or GERD, so I have to limit that a lot. I can exercise and feel amazing after, but for the next two days I feel even more exhausted than usual, like I *have to sleep now*, so again, any creative momentum is halted/put on the side. Sleep is ineffectual, even though I get a decent amount of hours these days. I find myself asking, Is there any source of energy I can actually rely on so I can live my life the way I want to? I don't know what to do. My life is ticking away and I can't even do the things I enjoy because of this endless fatigue and aversion to any-pressure-whatsoever that I have to deal with because of my brain being wired this way. Sorry I'm ranting, I'm just so fed up. I wish I could just know if it's worth continuing, or if I should just give up on those dreams and life goals, and fix my mind on something else.

On the surface, it looks like a simple piece of furniture, but there‚Äôs more to it than meets the eye. From assembling the table to using its lift-top feature, I‚Äôve experienced both its highlights and quirks.

**Design & Style**  
This coffee table has a sleek black finish that blends perfectly with modern or minimalist interiors, though it could also complement rustic or classic settings if paired with the right decor. The engineered wood material does give it a slightly manufactured feel, but the laminated surface manages to look polished. While it doesn‚Äôt scream luxury, it‚Äôs sturdy enough to handle daily knocks and bumps. The tapered legs add a touch of elegance, giving the table a balanced aesthetic.

[Looking for Yaheetech 338ECBA65 Coffee Table discounts? Check Amazon](https://decorgurus.com/product/yaheetech-338ecba65-994d03f4bd-coffee-table-review-b09mcg19q7/)

**Size and Functionality**  
Measuring 47.5 inches in length and 23.5 inches in width, this table is spacious without being overwhelming. It fits perfectly in my medium-sized living room, leaving enough room to move around while providing ample surface area. The adjustable height (19.5 inches to 24.5 inches) of the lift-top makes it multifunctional. Whether I‚Äôm working on my laptop, enjoying a meal, or unpacking board games for a family night, the table adapts easily.

**Storage & Stability**  
The hidden compartment beneath the lift-top is a game changer. I‚Äôve managed to stash away remotes, magazines, and even some small tech gadgets, ensuring a clutter-free surface. The three open cube shelves beneath are ideal for decorative baskets or books. Stability-wise, the table is solid, though the lift-top mechanism wobbles slightly when fully extended. It‚Äôs not a deal-breaker, but it‚Äôs something to consider if you plan to use it for tasks requiring a very steady surface, like writing or drawing.

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Spills have been easy to wipe off the laminated surface. However, the material isn‚Äôt entirely stain-resistant, so be cautious with liquids like coffee or wine. It‚Äôs also prone to light scratches, so I‚Äôd recommend using coasters or mats.

**Assembly Experience**  
Putting the table together was an adventure. The provided tools were sufficient, but I found a manual screwdriver offered better control. Assembly took just over an hour, primarily because aligning the lift-top mechanism was tricky. The springs are incredibly strong, so I‚Äôd advise caution. They snapped back unexpectedly once, nearly pinching my fingers. A second pair of hands would have made the process smoother, but I managed solo with some creative balancing using couch cushions.

**Pros**

* The lift-top design is practical and versatile for various activities.
* Hidden storage keeps the surface tidy, with additional open shelves for decor or essentials.
* The design is sleek and modern, fitting well with most interior themes.
* Durable construction for everyday use.
* Easy-to-follow assembly instructions, even for those with minimal DIY experience.

**Cons**

* Slight wobble in the lift-top when fully extended.
* Surface material is prone to scratches and isn‚Äôt completely stain-resistant.
* Assembly can be challenging, especially attaching the springs alone.
* The engineered wood construction, while sturdy, doesn‚Äôt feel as premium as solid wood.
* Heavy weight, making it less portable once assembled.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
After researching and comparing, the Yaheetech 338ECBA65 holds its own against similar coffee tables in the market. For instance, the WLIVE Lift Top Coffee Table offers a similar hidden and open storage design but lacks the same stability in its lift-top mechanism. On the other hand, the Sauder Edge Water Coffee Table feels more premium due to its higher-grade materials, but it comes at a steeper price and lacks the modern aesthetic of the Yaheetech table. The Yaheetech model‚Äôs price-to-feature ratio makes it a fantastic choice for those seeking functionality on a budget.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While this coffee table isn‚Äôt the cheapest option out there, its features justify the cost. The lift-top function alone adds immense value, transforming it into a multi-use piece for dining, working, or even kid-friendly activities. Compared to pricier alternatives, it punches above its weight in versatility and practicality. However, if you‚Äôre looking for something that feels luxurious or long-lasting beyond a few years, you might want to explore higher-end options.

**Features in Action**  
The lift-top mechanism is smooth, though it requires a bit of effort to pull up initially. Once up, it locks securely into place, and the foam pads included ensure silent operation. The hidden compartment is deep enough to hold multiple items, while the open shelves can support lightweight decor. Despite its weight, the table doesn‚Äôt feel cumbersome once in place, and the laminated surface is easy to clean with a damp cloth.

A few thoughts that keep me (somewhat) sane:

‚Ä¢ **Remind yourself why you started:** Anytime I'm stuck in the *is-this-over-yet* mindset, I revisit that initial spark. Was it to become healthier for your kids? Or maybe to land that dream gig? Reconnecting with that original fire can help me stop seeing treks as chores and more like stepping stones.

‚Ä¢ **Break the journey down:** Sometimes, focusing on the giant mountain ahead freaks me out. I‚Äôll set mini-goals‚Äîlike finishing just one chapter of a course, or hitting a mini-milestone at the gym. Smaller wins = more reason to celebrate along the way.

‚Ä¢ **Take breaks, guilt-free:** Seriously, who decided hustle had to mean constant exhaustion? A well-timed Netflix binge or a casual coffee date can reset your brain and keep you from burning out. *Work smarter, not harder*, like everyone loves to say.

‚Ä¢ **Find your cheer squad:** Got a friend who‚Äôs also on a long journey? Buddy up. Share memes, send random ‚Äúyou got this‚Äù texts, or even challenge each other in fun ways. It‚Äôs the best reminder that you‚Äôre not in this alone.

‚Ä¢ **Laugh at the bumps:** The road can feel bumpy, but a little humor makes it smoother. Stir craziness from practicing the same skill for hours? It might be comedic gold in the right light. 

It‚Äôs funny how recharging your motivation sometimes just requires a small shift in perspective. Feeling that spark dim doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre failing; it‚Äôs a nudge that you might need a breather or a fresh strategy. Then you can come back ready to sprint‚Äîor saunter‚Äîtoward the finish line. Sometimes, slow and steady really does win. 

Ever picked up a fun trick that helped you push through the tough parts? I‚Äôm always surprised by what a little creativity or laughter can do to keep the journey from feeling like a slog. I‚Äôm rooting for you. Keep going, one step at a time.",1,1739120611.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Considering buying used to maximize value, my priorities are:

* **Durable build quality**: A machine that will last without the need for future upgrades or modifications.
* **Ease of use**: Minimal tinkering required for consistent results.
* **Beginner-friendly**: Suitable for someone new to espresso making.
* **Temperature stability**: Planning to use light roasted coffee, so a PID controller is important for precise temperature control.

Machines I'm considering:

* **Gaggia Classic Pro**: Known for its solid build and performance.
* **Rancilio Silvia**: Renowned for durability and quality.
* **Breville Bambino Plus**: Features a PID for consistent temperature control and a thermoblock heating system, allowing for quick heat-up times.
* **Lelit Victoria**: Compact with a built-in PID for precise temperature control.
* **Lelit Anna 2**: An entry-level machine equipped with a PID.
* **MiiCoffee Apex 2**: Offers features like a PID and pressure gauge at an affordable price point.

Additional context:

* **Location**: Darmstadt, Germany.
* **Preferred drink types**: Primarily straight espresso/americano.
* **Drink frequency**: Typically 1-2 cups per day.
* **Space**: Limited countertop space, so a compact machine is preferred.
* **Experience level**: New to espresso making.
* **Grinder**: Currently using a K6 hand grinder; plan to upgrade to a grinder with a scale in the future.

Given these considerations, which of these machines would you recommend? Are there other models I should explore? Any advice on ease of use, maintenance, and long-term reliability would be greatly appreciated.

1ilj7rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1ilj7rd/5_aint_worth_it/,"""$5 ain't worth it"".","It's interesting seeing how many people clown on others for selling cheap items.

I once bought a coffee can of old tokens for around $50 at an auction. Over 500 of them in there. Listed any that should have been worth over $10 at $5 and the rest in groups of 5-10.

Sold over 100 of them for $5 bids, a few sold for over $100, and the rest in groups. 

Made around $700 after fees on that $50 can of tokens.

So that person that sold a sealed VHS for $3.94, let's say they listed 100 of them at $3.94 each plus shipping, and got every single one for 50 cents.

$1.28 in fees, 50 cents cost, add in 20 cents for a bubble mailer. That's $1.96 on each movie, and if they sell all 100, that's $196 profit on $50 spent.

With the march of time we see players able to demand ever higher wages and sponsorship deals for their time, so it's worth taking a look at what they are able to secure right now for entertaining the fans with top tier tennis. While the top pay only goes to the best players, they also need shrewd agents and the right demeanor in order to be able to strike the most profitable deals for themselves. Here's a look at who did the best out of last year in the pay scale.

\#10 Aryna Sabalenka - $13.6 million combined earnings

26 years old and born in Belarus, she won a second straight Australian Open last January but had to skip Wimbledon and the Olympics to recover from a shoulder injury. She won $6.7 million on court and had endorsements that brought in $7 million.

\#9 Casper Ruud - $13.9 million total

This Norweigan claimed his 12th career ATP Tour title last May in Geneva. Before having to take a bit of time out. He's got sponsorship deals tallying up to $10 million from companies like Renault and Handelsbanken.

\#8 Naomi Osaka - $14.6 million total

A very familiar name, she returned from having a baby in the last year and is working on building her form back up again. She has major sponsors Etsy, Maybelline, Meta AI and many others behind her, bringing in $14 million in side earnings.

\#7 Daniil Medvedev - $20.3 million total

He ""only"" has a single Grand Slam win at Flushing Meadows in 2021 but has reached five other major finals. He's got partnerships with the likes of HyperX gaming headsets, EA Sports, Ubisoft and is a part owner of esports company M8o which bring in $13 million collectively.

\#6 Rafael Nadal - $23.3 million total

Retirement must be drawing near for this legendary player who maybe surprisingly only earned $300,000 on court last year with the remainder coming from advertising partnerships. He is a 22-time Grand Slam winner and joined the Olympics last year. He is the ambassador for the Saudi Arabian tennis federation and also works with Kia, Infosys and Louis Vuitton.

\#5 Jannik Sinner - $26.6 million total

This Italian tested positive for a banned steroid in March 2024 which may end up denting his longer term earning potential, if he's able to continue playing tennis at all. Last year he had sponsors including Gucci, Rolex and Lavazza coffee that made him $15 million.

\#4 Iga Swiatek - $26.7 million total

Last year she earned a bronze at the Paris Olympics which came with a $50,000 bonus from Poland - making her the second highest earner from tournament winnings with $11.7 million won on court. She has deals with Lego and Lanc√¥me among many others.

\#3 Coco Gauff - $27.1 million total

This young and rising star had a major breakthrough in the singles championship during the 2023 U.S. Open. This have contributed to her partnering with Naked Brand, Fanatics, American eagle and many others to make $20 million off court.

\#2 Novak Djokovic - $37.3 million total

Made it 8 seasons in a row as the ATP Tour number 1, everyone knows he is an elite player that can sometimes express his frustration a little too readily. He earned an Olympic gold medal in Paris for his native Serbia. He has sponsorship deals from the likes of Waterdrop, Hublot, Lacoste and Asics - these earned him $25 million.

\#1 Carlos Alcaraz - $42.3 million total

He excels on clay courts and has been compared with many great players of the past. Able to earn the silver medal at the Olympic singles event, he still squeezed to the top of the arnings table based on off court deals worth a whopping $32 million.

1ilj3dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/JimCornette/comments/1ilj3dt/book_report_guy_with_a_post_that_details_the/,"Book report guy, with a post that details the tragic death of Owen Hart, using over a dozen different books for as much perspective as possible. If you liked that Hart Family post, then you should find this interesting as well.","Owen Hart's death is one of the darkest moments in the holistory of pro wrestling and to gather the accounts from a several different sources to piece together this story was difficult but helped me understand everyone's place a little better. Its pretty fascinating to read all the different perspectives for each of these events.

I posted this in another subreddit nearly two years ago and this was before I read several books that helped fill in some blanks or add context.

The main books I used here are...

""Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling"" by Heath McCoy

""Stu Hart: Lord of the Ring"" by Marsha Erb¬†

""Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling"" by Bret Hart

""Straight From The Hart"" by Bruce Hart

""Ringmaster: Vince McMahon and the Unmaking of America"" by Abraham Josephine Riesman in 2023.

Here are other books I took bits and pieces from so I can add more details...

""Under The Mat"" by Diana Hart with Kristie McLellan

""Hart Strings"" by Julie Hart

""Pure Dynamite"" by Dynamite Kid with Alison Coleman

""Under the Black Hat"" by Jim Ross with Paul O'Brien

""A Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex"" by Chris Jericho with Peter Thomas Forntale. 

""The Rock Says... The Most Electrifying Man In Sports-Entertainment"" by Dwayne Johnson and Joseph Layden

""It's True! It's True"" by Kurt Angle and John Harper

""Hollywood Hulk Hogan"" By Hulk Hogan and Mathew John Friedman (this book is a hilarious list of bullshit)

As always, it's all in chronological order, starting with the events following the Montreal Screwjob...

After the Montreal Screwjob in late 1997, Owen Hart tried and failed to get out of his contract along with Jim Neidhart and Davey Boy (British Bulldog). Davey Boy claims he had to pay $100,000 to get out, but Neidhart wasn't under contract and just walked. WWF owner and operator, Vince McMahon wouldn't let Owen go but did give him a raise from $300,000 per year to $400,000. 

According to Bret Hart, he and Owen worked a story where Owen tried telling Vince that Bret would disown him if he stayed and never speak to him again. Bret claims this was a work that he and Owen agreed on, but Bruce Hart is adamant that Bret really did disown Owen after the screwjob and that they never really talked again or repaired their relationship before Owen died. Bret insists that this isn't true and that he and Owen were always on good terms. 

Martha Hart, Owen's widow, claims he was very unhappy and felt trapped in WWF after Bret left. She says he turned down a program with Goldust, because he hated the character. She also said he turned down a storyline that would have seen him and Jeff Jarrett both ""sleeping"" with their valet Debra.

Owen turned down so many ideas that he felt like he couldn't turn down one more, so when he was given the orders to wear the Blue Blazer suit and fly from the rafters, he reluctantly agreed. Owen allegedly told several guys backstage that he didn't feel comfortable with the stunt.

One of those guys was Kurt Angle, who says Owen Hart took him under his wing and tried to teach him little things where he could. Kurt says the two bonded over their amateur backgrounds and Kurt credits Owen as one of the first guys to make him feel comfortable backstage in the WWF. 

Kurt Angle remembers seeing Owen backstage at the Over The Edge ppv they were putting on, and says Owen was nervous. Apparently Owen didn't like heights and confided to Kurt that he was nervous about the stunt entrance. 

During a rehersal of the stunt, Vince didnt like how much Owen struggled with the release hatch when he finally got to the ring, so Vince decided it needed to be quicker, and the one they got was designed to let go after the smallest amount of pressure. Martha Hart says the pressure required for the harness to release was similar to pulling the trigger of a gun.

At 7:41pm on May 23rd, 1999, at a show in Kansas City, the lights dimmed and Owen Hart readied himself in the rafters and began to be carried out. Owen made what appeared to be an adjustment to his cape, and the three men up in the rafters to help him, all heard the click of snap shackle being released. The three men all say they were looking away and by the time they looked back, Owen was clawing at the air while falling to his demise.

Several fans later say they heard Owen scream as he plunged 45 miles per hour to the mat below.

Owen hit the ring ropes violently before crashing down into the corner of the ring, just missing the turnbuckle. The impact shattered Owen's left arm and tore his aorta, the artery leading to his heart. As his lungs filled with blood, Owen lifted his head a few inches off the mat, as though gasping for survival. A moment later, Owen weakly dropped his head, his eyes staring blankly ahead. Police later confirmed that Owen survived for 8 minutes after hitting the ring, with a severally torn aorta, his lungs filled with blood as he drowned to death.

Owen hit the ring so hard that he smashed several wooden planks and left the ropes loosened like rubber bands. 

Backstage was utter fucking chaos, as you can imagine, and no one can account for where specifically Vince was during the chaos. Some say that it was so chaotic they hardly remember a specific sequence of events, but no one has ever confirmed where Vince was or how he personally reacted. 

We know Vince made several decisions very quickly after Owen fell. The first was that the wrestlers backstage were told Owen's fate was ""undetermined."" The crowd who just witnessed the fall would be told nothing. And most importantly, the ppv would continue.

The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, described in his book the 1999 Over The Edge ppv and how he was backstage, going over his match when someone said, ""Owen's hurt. It looks bad. They are working on him in the ring."" Rock says Vince McMahon had to talk Rock out of running to the ring to help Owen as Jerry Lawler had done. Vince said the fans will react to seeing Rock and think it's part of the show. 

Owen's sister Diana Hart says she and her kids were watching the 1999 Over The Edge ppv by coincidence because Diana wanted to get up to speed on WWF storylines as her husband Davey Boy was heading back to the company. She said she stepped away for a few minutes before a TSN reporter called her and asked about Owen's condition and that they were praying for him. After she hung up, her son Harry came running over saying something happened to Owen.

Jim Ross told the live audience that he would keep them appraised of Owen's condition as the show continued.

Jeff Jarrett remembers how chaotic it was backstage, and specifically remembers Owen's body being wheeled past him as someone was grabbing him and yelling ""Go, go, go!"" Because his match was after Owen's.

Vince McMahon called Martha himself to tell her Owen ""has fallen from above the ring and he's hurt."" Martha initially thought this to be some bad storyline and got hot before Vince made it clear that it's real and paramedics are trying their best right now. A terrified and angry Martha demanded to know if those were real doctors and trained professionals and not the quack bullshit guys they usually had sitting ringside, pretending to be legit. McMahon responded meekly saying ""someone will call you soon"" before ending the call.

Martha then called The Hart House and being a Sunday, everyone was over for the weekly feast/ to watch the hockey game, and blissfully unaware of the tragedy. Martha told them what she knew and promised to call back when she knew more. 

Chris Jericho describes watching WWF ppv Over the Edge in 1999 in his book, noting that he was sitting with his future wife Jessica Lockhart. Jericho was enjoying time off between companies and wanted to check out a WWF show, because he would soon join the company. He was pretty horrified to be sitting at home like a fan watching on TV the night Owen Hart fell to his death.

Martha got a call from a Kansas City doctor called and gave her the horrible news, that Owen was gone. She then mustered up all her strength and called the Hart House again. Helen answered. By this time the news was swirling but no one knew anything, everyone calling the Hart House for news and to give their prayers for Owen's recovery. The 75 year old Helen Hart pleaded with Martha on the phone saying ""No. Not Owen, he can't be gone."" Then as if struck by reality, Helen dropped the phone let out an anguished scream, ""Owen's dead!"" For the first and only time in his life, Bruce Hart saw tears spew from his father's eyes. ""They were coming out like sweat"" Bruce described it ""But he never said a word.""

Bruce Hart, the 2nd oldest Hart sibling, remembers it as his younger sister Allison answering the phone and screaming ""Owen's dead!"" And he also says he initially thought it was a storyline they weren't warned about.

Diana says that Stu called her first to tell her Owen died, because of how close she and Owen were.

Around 8:40pm, about an hour after Owen fell, Jim Ross was told by Kevin Dunn over the headset that Owen Hart was dead, and then instructed him to tell the world with a 10 second heads up. Poor JR, you could tell while reading his book that this did a number on his mental health and caused some PTSD. JR had to tell the world that Owen Hart had died and as he did you could still hear the fans in that Kansas City crowd hooting and hollering behind him.

Bret Hart was on an airplane when he got a message from the pilot, saying ""call home immediately, family emergency!"" After calling home numerous times to no answer, Bret finally got through to someone in WWF, he found out Owen had died. Bret wasn't given any details, just that Owen was dead.

In Hulk Hogan's book of lies, Hogan claims that he was the one to make sure Bret was told about his brother's death. Which we can all just ignore and write off as bullshit. But as a book-historian, I feel obligated to point out his bullishit point of view.

The Rock says in his book that he was told 2 minutes prior to his match, that Owen had died. Rock doesn't blame anyone and side steps saying literally anything of consequence, other than how much he loved Owen. He says he left a voice mail for Bret Hart as well, but notes how it was definitely 1 of 100 messages Bret got that night.

The PPV ended as it was planned, with Undertaker beating Stone Cold in the main event, and Vince joining them in the ring making a theatrical display using his facial reactions to put over the storylines. In the final moments before the cameras fade to black, you can see Vince uncharacteristically cast his head down with a shadow over his face, probably relieved the show was finally over.

Twenty minutes later, Vince was hastily speaking at a press conference, addressing the tragic fate of Owen Hart, confirming his demise. When a reporter asks why there wasn't a backup line in case Owen fell, and Vince defensively snapped back, ""I'm not an expert in rigging. I guess you are."" When another reporter suggested there seemed to be no precautionary measures, Vince got defenceive again saying, ""First of all, I resent your tone.""

The reporter, hilariously snapped back, ""I resent your sarcasm!""

Vince, now incensed, responded by saying, ""No, no, I resent your tone, lady, okay? This is a tragic accident. This is a tragic accident. Don't try and put yourself in the spotlight here, okay?"" Fuck Vince.

Bruce Hart remembers how cold and mean Owen's wife (now widow) Martha was when they got to her house that night and how much it hurt him to hear Martha talk about how she always hated wrestling. Bruce notes how you never hear Dale Earnhardt's widow condemning NASCAR after he died. Bruce again insists that Martha was wrong and Owen did love the wrestling buisness, calling any opposing opinion as horseshit. 

Bruce recalls how Martha acted like she was the only one who lost someone and notes how he didn't like how she treated his parents that night.

Bruce remembers how Vince called the Hart House at 2am the night Owen died and he sounded like he had a few drinks. Bruce said they had a good talk and he believed how sorry Vince sounded. His sister Allison picked up another phone in the house and screamed at Vince for several minutes before she hung up. Bruce apologized to Vince for his sisters outburst before they hung up.

Bruce is genuinely more sympathetic towards Vince in this whole scenario than Martha or some of his siblings. He likes to look at it from a ""bookers perspective' and how guilty he would feel in Vince's position.

Bret made it to the Hart House the next morning at 11am to find it besieged with press, reporters and camera men everywhere, with his siblings and parents taking turns to give interviews. Bret remembers laughing to himself when Luna the family dog came up to greet him. He thought how Owen would have found it funny that the old dog had outlived both him and their older brother Dean.

Bret went over to Martha's and found her already talking to a lawyer and was amazed by her composure. Bret noted that while Owen was falling to his death, Martha was back with the kids, planning to move into their new dream home.

Bret remembers how he and Martha sat watching Davey Boy on Tv speaking to the press, saying that this was a terrible accident and no one's fault. Bret was pissed because it was too soon to be saying that, no investigation had been done yet!

Before the that nights RAW in St Louis, Vince spoke to the press outside the venue and said, ""It was a tragic, tragic, horrible accident."" Vince also vowed to never use a descender stunt ever again, ""out of respect for Owen.""

The Vince book details the Owen Hart memorial show on RAW that day, and points out how following the 10-bell salute, the McMahon's and the crowd applauded, but none of the wrestlers on stage joined in. 

The Rock said in his book that he is very proud of the episode of RAW they put on the next night, as a tribute to Owen. 

Martha asked Bret to deal with any media concerns, so he found himself shooting Good Morning America 2 days later from Stu's living room. Martha's lawyers were present to ensure Bret didn't say anything he shouldnt, so Bret focused on talking about how wrestlers need a union and that would have at least helped point out the difference between wrestling and stunt work.

Diana said she later found out that Bret spent that night at Martha's to console her. But she hints at an affair which is just wild, though she tries to cover her ass by saying ""I'm sure it was platonic,"" before ranting about how Bret manipulated Martha into wanting to sue Vince.

Martha asked Bret to come with her when Owen's body was brought home on May 27th. Bret remembers kissing Owen's cheek later that day at the viewing. He remembers how cold Owen was, and how he was closer to a porcelain doll than his brother now. Bret couldn't help but think to himself ""Ah Owen, what were you thinking.""

Vince called Bret everyday leaving voice mails, asking Bret to call him back. Bret refused to talk to Vince until he had a better understanding of the role Vince played in Owen's death.

Martha remembers when she brought her kids to the funeral home to say goodbye, and how her young daughter cried and pleaded for Owen to wake up.

Martha and most of the family hate how Vince and WWF handled Owen's death, first allowing the show to continue after Owen died, then for putting on that tribute show the next night. Martha was furious that they would try to pop a rating using her husband's tragic demise. In a moment that would foreshadow the family's divisive response to this, Davey Boy Smith would praise Vince McMahon response, hoping he could secure himself a job in the company.

Bret finally agreed to meet with Vince and talk to him, suggesting a secluded and quiet place where Bret liked to sit and think. Years later, Bret talked to a Calgary police officer who told Bret that Vince had actually hired the police department to scope out the area and observe the whole conversation, apparently Vince was worried that Bret may get violent. The police officer told Bret that he heard their entire conversation because Vince actually wore a wire to the meeting! The police officer told Bret that he was impressed by Bret's grace and candor. 

Bret asked Vince what happened and Vince said he didn't have much details because he was in makeup when it happened. Bret gave Vince a heads up that Martha was probably going to sue and Vince appreciated that. Vince asked if he should visit Stu, and Bret told him to wait until after the funeral. Bret recalls Bruce and Ellie specifically calling for Vince's head that morning at the Hart House. I find that hard to believe considering the stance that both Bruce and Ellie would end up taking (Vince's side), but maybe they were just putting on a show for their parents?

Bret asked Vince why he didn't stop the show. Vince claims he genuinely didn't know what to do, and was afraid of a riot. Bret scoffed at the notion and asked Vince if he would have stopped the show had it been Shane who fell to his death? Vince just looked off and repeated himself saying ""I didn't know what to do."" I believe Vince as far as ""I didn't know what to do."" But I don't believe anyone thought those fans would have rioted that night. 

Vince told Bret ""There isn't a day that goes by where I don't regret what I did to you."" And even told Bret that he needs to come back to the WWF, that he should finish his career there and that he would put the belt back on him and he would have a storyline for him tomorrow. Bret turned him down, explaining that he just re-signed with WCW for another couple years. 

Vince asked Bret if there was anything he could do, and this is when Bret asked for access to his video library, telling Vince he didn't want to be forgotten or his legacy erased. I feel conflicted here, Bret had every right to ask for this at some point, but to do it here seems very, for lack of a better word, calculated. 

Vince and Bret spent 2 hours talking that day, before shaking hands and saying goodbye. Bret says he felt good after that conversation and if the police don't find Vince accountable, then Bret should be able to forgive him as well.

Bruce Hart notes how both Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho spent a week at the Hart House following Owen's death just to help out, make coffee, babysit or whatever was needed. Though the timeline of this is called into question when you look at Benoit and Jericho's schedules that day. Jericho doesn't mention this in his book, so it's probably a weird embellishment from Bruce. Next to Hogan's book, Bruce's is the most full of bullshit I've ever read.

According to Bruce, the night before the funeral, Bret called Bruce up, to say that Vince deliberately killed Owen as a way of getting revenge for the Montreal Screwjob. This was the first they spoke since before Owen passed. 

Martha not only invited Vince McMahon to the funeral, she insisted he come so he can see and face the corpse of the man he sent to die and the fatherless children he left behind.

Diana says she spoke to Vince McMahon on the phone the morning of Owen's funeral and she puts over how compassionate and loving Vince was. She also says that Bret will kill her for saying this, but she believes Owen Hart was like a son to Vince McMahon.

Bret remembers being furious to see two of his sisters Ellie and Diana on either arm of Vince McMahon, guiding him into Stu's limo on the way to the funeral. He thought to himself that Vince was ""far from forgiven.""

Chris Jericho describes going to Owen's funeral and running into Hulk Hogan. Hulk flat out asked Jericho if he was going to work for WWF. When Chris said yes, Hogan responded with, ""Can you take me with you?""

The Rock and his wife Dany flew out to Calgary for Owen's funeral. He speaks on how difficult it was to see Owen physically in the casket. He defends his decision to speak on that show still in character as The Rock, saying that Owen would have wanted that.

Bruce thought he was to deliver a eulogy and wrote one up, but said when he got to the Funeral, Bruce claims that Bret told him, ""Fuck off, your not speaking."" Bruce always claimed he was closest to Owen out of all his siblings, and this hurt him. He says Bret was depriving him of this because Bruce didn't agree with him about Vince. In Bret's book, he says that Martha made the call on who gave eulogies and that Bruce was mad that Martha said he wasn't allowed. 

Bruce says the speech he had written would have addressed how wrestlers aren't disposable and how promoters shouldn't be blamed for everything. He genuinely thought that Owen's funeral was the time for that. He seemed to think this ridiculous speech would have healed all wounds and brought everyone together. Bruce is so delusional.

Bret remembers his older sister Diana being angry over how much TV coverage Bret was getting that week. Seriously.

Bret also remembers how Smith, the oldest Hart sibling, wrote a poem for Owen, but Martha said no to that as well. Martha asked Owen's older brothers Ross and Bret to deliver speeches, and specifically asked Bret to tell some lighthearted stories before her speech. Obviously she knew what she was doing. Bret was nice enough to include Smith's poem to Owen, in his book. Really classy gesture from Bret imo.

Bret didn't appreciate all the heat he was catching from his family, just for doing what Martha asked. Bret remembers not wanting to be on TV all week, not wanting to make a big speech and not wanting to be on Larry King Live right after the funeral. Bret was just doing what ever his brothers widow asked of him.

Martha, Ross and Brett all delivered eulogies at the funeral, with Bret in particular making people laugh with stories of his younger brother. But it was Matha's eulogy that was most poinent, when she turned to Vince McMahon and said ""There will be a day of reckoning. This is my final promise to Owen. I won't let him down.""

Diana says that Martha didn't thank Diana during Martha's speech at the funeral. Martha thanked each of Owen's siblings, except Diana. Diana says that later Bret would bring this up and tell her that Owen thought Diana was useless and didn't like her.

Calgary Police closed down major highways and roads for the funeral procession, with thousands of people standing on the road, wearing their Sunday best, blowing their heads and paying their respects. It was without a doubt, the biggest funeral Calgary has ever seen. 

Bret remembers seeing a bus full of WWF personal with a big banner on the side saying ""OWEN FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS"" and Bret felt like this was Vince just doing damage control.

When the funeral procession got to the cemetery, Martha was furious to see that the big flower arrangement sent from Vince, was set up so the flowers actually made the WWF logo. Martha ordered it removed immediately and saw how Vince wanted credit for his transparent generosity and compassion. ""It wasn't going to happen under my watch"" Martha remembers saying.

In another quip from Hogan's book, he says that after Owen's funeral, that he sat with Stu and Bret Hart longer than anyone else. He says he thought at the time that things were good between him and Bret, and didn't understand why he would later hear that Bret was bad mouthing him. Hogan said ""I didn't get it.""

Shane McMahon actually said a few words at the service as well, trying to positioning the Hart's and McMahon's as allies following Owen's death. Some of the Hart's, like Diana,  actually believed it, she told a reporter: ""Dad is like a father figure to Vince and Vince felt like Owen was one of his sons. It must have been hard for Vince to see Owen's father in this situation."" Martha was disgusted when she saw Ellie and Diana hugging McMahon. 

Bret called Diana after seeing this quote and how big of a smile Diana had for her picture in the newspaper, as she stood next to a deflated Stu. Diana immediately started screaming at Bret, saying Owen was a better wrestler, how Bret always held him back and how jealous Bret was of Owen. Bret simply asked her ""you couldn't just say no comment? Like Martha and her lawyers asked us?"" Diana responded by accusing Bret of having a vendetta over Montreal Screwjob and how selfish he is. Bret tried pleading with her that this isn't about him, this is for Martha! Suddenly Ellie started chiming in on the call and Bret realized it was a 3-way call the whole time, Ellie just started yelling at Bret, telling him how much she has hated him since the day he was born. Bret tried to explain that he is only doing exacly what Owen would be doing if he was there, which was supporting Martha. Bret realizing what his sisters were trying to do, and finally snapped on them, saying that if they use Owen's death to get their husband's jobs in WWF, that he will never forgive them or speak to them again.

Diana claims that Bret threatened to kill her during that call and promised that is he sees her on the street, he would run her down with her car. He then threatened to publish articles about Davey being a drug addict and Diana's suicide attempt. At the time, Bret had a weekly column in the Calgary Sun about what ever he felt like. Though, Bruce Hart claims to have written most of it until a jealous Bret fired him.

Martha made it clear to Vince that he isn't to use anything about the funural on his TV, but she was horrified to see Vince showing footage of the funeral on Monday Night RAW. ""I feel exploited and violated"" she told reporters and Vince responded by not only claiming she said he can use the footage as a way for the fans to say goodbye to Owen, but Vince also claimed he tried to pick up all the funeral costs but Martha wouldn't allow it.

Bruce Hart says in his book that Vince and Stu talked privately at the funeral and Stu confided to Bruce that Vince took full responsibility, and offered 90 million dollars to the family. Stu told Bruce he wanted to accept it, but needed to talk with Helen and Martha first. This ""90 million"" number seemingly came out of nowhere, and would change as Bruce retells the story over the years.

After the funeral, Bret recieved a FedEx package from WWF that included Owen's bloody Blue Blazer gear. Bret held up the bloody mask that was cut off Owen as he was dying and remembered that at ine point, he actually pitched wearing a mask to Owen.

Martha Hart, along with Owen's parents Stu and Helen Hart would sue Vince McMahon and 12 others, including the riggers who set up the harness and Kansas City, which owned the arena Owen died in. 

Bret says he supported Martha 100% but was secretly hoping to be told that his little brother wasn't murdered. Bret says he had great difficulty in keeping his siblings away from the media and damaging Martha's case.

Bruce claims that his father Stu confided in him afterward how Martha was insistent on Vince going down and Bret just wanted revenge for the Montreal Screwjob. Stu told Bruce that he felt he had to go along with them, for fear of the family being ripped apart. This conversation was told in Bruce's book. A lot of Bruce's book consists of private conversations he had with now deceased people, who seemingly agreed with his every point or praised his talents endlessly.

When Martha and Bret went to Kansas City to meet with police, they were shocked to find out that up until the afternoon Owen died, that the WWF were originally going to have Owen fly down from the rafters with a little person tied to him. (The same little person who dressed up as Bret Hart on RAW shortly after the Montreal Screwjob) They nixed the idea that afternoon, but could you imagine if Owen had fallen while a little person was strapped to him? Jesus christ..

Bret and Martha were taken to the arena Owen died in, when an actual slimy insurance adjuster tagging along with them for god only knows what self serving interests. He had to be forcibly removed by security, and Bret notes how ""creepy"" he was.

Bret remembers climbing up to the rafters of the building where Owen fell, and thinking to himself ""what the hell were you thinking Owen?"" Bret knows that if he was still in the WWF, he wouldn't have let Owen do this, that Owen wouldnt have died.

Smith wanted to sue Vince as well, claiming that he and Owen were planing on opening a wrestling school together. Bret scoffs at this, noting that Owen wouldn't have opened a lemonade stand with Smith.

Diana and Ellie got talking to Vince and convinced him that Bret was the driving force behind Martha's lawsuit. So Vince decided to not give Bret access to his video library.

WWF countersued Martha, claiming she had breached Owen's contract and they were able to move the court proceedings to Connecticut, where their home base is set up. Linda McMahon told CNBC TV that The WWF would love to be able to settle and work through this whole ordeal with Mrs Hart in a way that will take care of her and her children for the rest of their lives."" Martha would later write about how her lawyers never once recieved a settlement offer.

Bret Hart confirms this in his book as well, saying no settlement was ever genuinely offered, that he was aware of.

Bruce Hart would still dispute this claim, saying that after the funeral, Vince offered Stu a sttlement with ""no strings attached."" His story and account of this has changed a bit over the years. He wrote in his book that Vince offers 90 million, but told an interview prior that Vince offered 33 million. He never could keep his stories straight. Bruce says Stu was inclined to accept the offer, saying that as disgusted by the accident and as upset as he was over the loss of his son, he says Stu thought it to be a genuine accident. Bruce said that Stu believed that as long McMahon accepted responsibility and looked after Martha's family, that there was no need to go after Vince. Bruce says all this and says he agrees with that, citing angles he organized and if someone ever died he would have felt terrible. Again, Bruce talks about a lot of private conversations where Stu Hart seemingly contradicted himself and these are the only times Stu ever agreed with Bruce. 

According to Bruce, Stu was reluctant to join Martha's lawsuit, especially as he was asked to sign away all control in legal proceedings to Martha, even though he was paying the majority of the huge lawyer fees. Nonetheless, he told many people that he wanted to support Owen's family, so he stood by Martha.

According to Bret, Stu was never the same after Owen died. This one clearly hit the family harder than any previous tragedy, and Owen wasn't the 1st or even 2nd Hart to die young in the 90's.

Jeff Jarrett told Bret that Martha's lawyers contacted him and asked about the possibility of infidelity on Owen's part. Jeff says he was so pissed off he refused to talk to the lawyers again, and Bret had to explain that they were just doing their jobs.

Vince would do an interview on TSN and use the private converation he and Bret had after Owen died agaiant him. Vince claimed that all Bret wanted to do was talk about himself and not Owen. Vince framed this as gross and painted Bret out like a sociopath. Vince even said he acted like a skeleton in their conversation. 

Much later, Bret was finally able to respond by clearing up how lawyers told him to specifically not talk about Owen. And on that point about acting like a skeleton, Bret said ""considering my family just buried my younger brother, is that surprising?""

Bret says he had a hard time convincing WCW to go through with the Owen Hart tribute match. Bret says it was Benoit who pushed hard for it.

At the Hart House on XMas day in 1999, Bret and Ellie got into another shouting match where Ellie accused Bret of using his vendetta against Vince to push the lawsuit. Bret fired back, telling her that this is Martha's call and he supports her. Then he asks how she can sleep at night, knowing she is siding with the man who killed her own brother, how can she stand against her own parents! Ellie simply responded by saying ""real easy."" Stu was hurt and told Bret ""I'm sure she is not doing that"" and Bret said ""Ask her yourself!"" Bret's mother came to his defence, trying to explain to Ellie that they are supporting Martha here. Ellie snapped back about how their mom always sides with Bret.

Bret says after months of his family fights long and picking sides, he felt isolated as the only one standing shoulder to shoulder with Martha. He began to avoid her calls, growing tired of her complaining about Ellie and Diana pushing the parents towards reconciliation with Vince and Bruce being a constant form of conflict. 

Martha had sent a copy of her lawyers case files over to the Hart House, since Stu and Helen were financing it. Helen left the papers laying around, allowing Ellie and Diana the opportunity to fax the entire thing to Jerry McDevit, the WWF lawyer. It was ridiculous and tipped the scales in WWF favor according to multiple sources.

One time, Stu asked Bret what it would take to make peace with Ellie and Diana. Bret says n his book that maybe he was too stubborn, but he told Stu "" Out of respect for Owen, I can't.""

Bret remembers thinking how Vince must be laughing at how easy it was to play the Hart's against one another.

On November 3rd, 2000, Martha called Bret and told him that they were finally going to settle. Bret says he felt hurt when Martha told him she couldn't disclose the amount to him because she swore an oath. Bret did ask her if they ever found out what happened exactly to Owen that night. Bret says that she meekly offered up, ""He just fell.""

Bret actually asked her if they were able to get his video library and such back from WWF. Martha said her lawyers deemed it to insignificant to even bring up. I agree.

Martha finally agreed to settle, for $18 million, with 10 going to Martha, her kids getting 3 each and 1 million going to Stu and Helen. After all the legal fees though,Stu and Helen would recieve less than $700,000 each. Bret found out about the exact amount through some media contacts he had at the time.

Bruce Hart of course takes credit for the lawsuit finally being settled, saying he personally called WWF lawyer Jerry McDevit weeks before and sped things along.

Bret remembers Martha saying ""There will be a day of reckoning"" at Owen's funeral, and not feeling satisfied with how it all turned out.

After the settlement, Martha began to speak to the press about the Hart's and how they handled Owen's death. ""These people worked against me, I am removing myself and my children from the family. I carry the last name, but I'm not related to them anymore."" And while some call this mean spirited, I struggle to not side with her. Who cares if a few siblings stood by you, most of the family didn't have her best interest or her children at heart. The author of the book detailing the History Of Stampede Wrestling, Heath McCoy makes it clear he doesn't like how Martha responded after the settlement, saying that Kieth and Allison stood by her, and the author even tried to justify Ellie, Bruce and Gorgia's actions by saying they needed the money.  

Bret says he called up Martha about the comments she made and told her that he felt like she just used him and he was very hurt by her comments.

Late in Bret Hart's book he makes a point to mention how it was Vince Russo who pitched an idea that led to Owen's death. Specifically, Russo wanted Owen to trip and fall on his face as soon as he landed in the ring. That is why McMahon changed the release latch to the smaller quicker one, so there was no delay in Owen unhooking himself and falling in his face. Bret writes ""I'm not laying blame here. It's punishment enough that Russo has to live with his role in Owen's death.""

When WWF ran a RAW episode in Calgary in 2001, Martha publicly said any Hart who attended would be disrespecting the memory of Owen Hart. Bret felt the same way and promised Martha they wouldn't be attending, but Bruce and Ellie came to the Hart House early and picked up Stu before Bret could stop him. Helen opted to wait for Bret, who convinced her not to go once he finally got there. At the show, Stu, looking gaunt and sickly from pneumonia and heart problems, had to be helped to his feet by Bruce, as Diana, Smith, Ellie and many grandkids all stood up and waved too. Smith gave a sly smile and held up a sign that said ""Hi, Bret."" 

Bret remembers tears forming as he watched the opening segment ungold on TV, complete with Smith holding the sign. (Though in his book, he said the sign spelt out ""HA HA Bret!"" I didn't go back and check what it actually says) 

Bret says he heard later that Bruce and Diana had pushed a wheelchair stuck Stu right up to Vince's office, but then got into a huge shouting match over who gets to pitch what ever they were trying to sell, to Vince. Apparently, Vince barely gave them a moment and had them both quickly shoo'd out of the room.

Bruce and Diana brought Stu to the next show in Edmonton, to which Bret recieved concerned calls from Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho over his father's health and seeing him being paraded around backstage like that.

Martha called the Hart House later that night and screamed at Helen telling them all that they should be ashamed and to go to hell!

Bret would also join Martha in screaming, as he drive right to the House and screamed at everyone, parents included for allowing this behavior. He then took baby pictures of Owen off the wall and left. Bret was so pissed off that he didn't attend a big award service for Stu that was held in Ottawa and recognized by the government. Bret clearly regrets this decision deeply, and knows it wasn't his parents fault. A few weeks later, he returned the photo's and hugged his mom again.

Bret had testified against Smith in his attempt to gain custody of one of his kids the year prior, and Smith never forgave Bret for this. In Bret's book, he said it was more important for him to be a good uncle over being a good brother. He didn't see Smith as a competent parent, and he probably wasn't wrong. Smith didn't even know how many kids he had, never had a real job, and only survived with money given to him by his parents. 

I'm running out of room in my post, as I always do with these lame reports haha if anyone wants to see the Montreal Screwjob post up on this subreddit, let me know.

I got a book series unrelated to wrestling that I'm currently reading, but I am planning to have more posts up on Vince McMahon and Madusa before reading that deep dive book into wrestling's origins.

""Choose your attorney (you can have more than one).

Fill in the forms to appoint them as an attorney.

Register your LPA with the Office of the Public Guardian""

It sounds like the certificate provider can be a neighbour who knows them well, In my case my mum's neighbour has known her for years and they often have coffee together so I don't believe that's an issue.

It sounds like the witness can be anyone over the age of 18. 

So Mum would be the Donor, I would be the attorney, the neighbour would be the certificate provider and the neighbour's partner would be the witness. 

From what I can tell, this is everything needed to get it done. It doesn't mention anywhere that you need to involve a solicitor? Then you just send it off with the fee and get it registered.

Is my understanding of this correct? Have I missed anything? I read through a lot of other LPA posts and lots of them mention solicitors so I was a bit confused.

#Truth Bullets

[Nanami File](#bullet) The victim is Byakuya Togami. Probably. Byakuya should have died at, maybe‚Ä¶10:35PM‚Ä¶ish? I think?

[Mikan's Autopsy](#bullet) The cause of death is suffocation from blood filling his lungs due to a stab to the neck. The death was within less than a minute. Yes, it was Byakuya Togami. 10:35PM matches what Mikan concluded from her analysis.

[DICE Directive #1 - The Friend Ship](#bullet) What ship never sinks? That‚Äôs right! The Friend Ship! Unfortunately, Hope‚Äôs Peak isn‚Äôt friendship, it‚Äôs a building, and it‚Äôs filling up with water with every passing moment. In an undetermined amount of time the entire school will be submerged. Unless‚Ä¶

[Adaptation is Key](#bullet) As the first floor was submerged, the astute staff working hard at DICE realized certain necessary faculties were no longer accessible. The fifth floor biology lab was converted into a room with a kitchen area and a dining area. Showers and additional sinks have been added to each communal bathroom on their respective floors. The Physics Lab on the fourth floor was turned into a theater room. Lastly, all classrooms are equipped with a basic lock that can only be locked from the inside.

[Byakuya's Adapted Library](#bullet) The library showed clear signs of Byakuya modifying to his personal preferences, with furniture shifted and personal items scattered. Some include the many books stacked on the table, a corner to write with a notebook and pens, another to sit and listen to vinyl records, and another for snacking and drinking. One particular modification is that there was originally a small glass vase on the front counter, but now only shattered pieces remain.  
 
[The Archives](#bullet) Byakuya repurposed the Archives, a room inside the Library, to become his sleeping quarters. The walls are lined up with shelves almost fully packed with volumes to long encyclopedias, each row being a different edition. Seemingly, the last book on one of the rows is missing. There is a sleeping bag on the floor and a small coffee table. The door to the Archives can be locked from the inside and showed no signs of tampering. 

[Uneven Coffee Table](#bullet) The coffee table inside the Archives had one of the four legs broken, needing about three inches to balance. Byakuya placed the twenty-first volume of The DICE-Revised Universal Compendium of All Knowledge‚Ñ¢Ô∏è under the leg to fix this problem.

[Slumber Party Massacre](#bullet) Rooms are less plentiful as the school fills with water ~ so people had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. The following people have confirmed their location of rest (courtesy sleeping bags and pillows provided by DICE): 

Byakuya - Archives

Ibuki + Himiko - Classroom 2A

Mondo + Chihiro - Classroom 2B

Komaru + Mikan - Classroom 3A

Yasuhiro + Gundham - Classroom 3B

Mukuro - Classroom 4A

Kaede + Maki + Kaito - Classroom 4B

Kirumi + Angie - Classroom 5A

Korekiyo - Classroom 5B

Fuyuhiko - Classroom 5C

[Idle Hands are the Devil‚Äôs Workshop](#bullet) At 8:00 AM this morning DICE sent a personalized message to every student. It indicated that their orientation period has finished and they are now to begin the training program in earnest. Each student was given a list of tasks unique to them that must be completed before midnight unless they were tired of that whole ‚Äúliving‚Äù thing.

[Isolation](#bullet) Upon finding out they were being ~~forced~~ invited into a DICE Killing Game, most of the class used this as a chance to unify. Byakuya was not one of those people. Shortly after the situation was apparent to all, Byakuya claimed the library for himself and would only occasionally leave for minimum periods of time for necessities such as going to the bathroom. 

[Body Discovery](#bullet) Shortly after 11 PM a loud noise sounding like glass shattering was heard coming from the library. Ibuki, Himiko, Chihiro, and Mondo followed the noise and found the library unlocked. They found Byakuya‚Äôs corpse after walking into the library and noticing the scent of blood from the Archives room. Upon seeing the corpse the body discovery announcement rang out (11:20 PM) and the remaining class members arrived shortly after. 

[Crime Scene](#bullet) Byakuya was found in the library archive lying face down head towards the door. Blood can be found on his neck where the stab wound was made and a trail can be observed from his sleeping bag to the door. Blood is on his hands and the door knob. 

[Knives Out](#bullet) A knife was found at the scene of the crime next to Byakuya‚Äôs body. The knife has stains of blood on the blade.

[Missing Glue](#bullet) Angie noticed that Fast Acting Glue went missing from the art room at 3:30pm. 

[All the World‚Äôs a Stage](#bullet) Chiaki and Kokichi confirm that Byakuya's task was to do public dramatic readings. From 3:30-5:00 PM  Byakuya performed different renditions of Shakespeare to the absolute delight of Kokichi. Chiaki and Komaru were there as well.

[Maintenance Issues](#bullet) Korekiyo investigated the Chemistry Lab and something seems to be clogging the drain of the sink.

[Stuck Books](#bullet) Gundham attempted to move some of the books on a shelf of the Archives and was unable to dislodge any book in the row whatsoever.

[Glass Pieces](#bullet) Fuyuhiko tried to gather the scattered glass shards. He used a book to transport the pieces but quickly abandoned the idea when the jagged edges began slicing into the book‚Äôs cover with minimal pressure.

[Kirumi's Testimony](#bullet) Kirumi claims that her task entailed cooking a lot of food, so she kept the Kitchen (Biology Lab) occupied from 7:45AM to 10PM. She can testify that Kaito, Maki, Ibuki, Yasuhiro, Komaru, Gundham, Angie, and Himiko, and only these people, entered the kitchen at various times outside of usual meal hours, when the kitchen was not off-limits.

[Knife Holder](#bullet) The kitchen knives are stored in a stand affixed to the countertop, but one of the knives is missing. The object is coated with water on the outside.
 
[Ibuki's Testimony](#bullet) During investigation, Ibuki was investigating the kitchen, and while handling the knife holder, accidentally let her ring fall inside one of the slits. She tried several methods to get it out, but she couldn't find a way into the opening. 

[Mukuro and Maki‚Äôs Testimony](#bullet) During their investigation, Mukuro and Maki discussed the possibility of hiding in the Archives. They confirmed that the entrance offered a clear view of all corners. Although they identified a way for a makeshift stack of books to possibly conceal someone, it would stand out enough to arouse suspicion.

[Kitchen Fire](#bullet) Kaito was attempting to cook a very masculine strawberry cake with pink frosting before one thing led to another and (in what could have happened to anyone) started a kitchen fire around 10:30 PM causing the sprinklers to douse the room in water. Maki discovered the commotion and was appropriately disappointed in him. They left the room about fifteen minutes after, with permission from Chiaki, as the room would fix itself overnight.

Thursday February 6th, 2025 writing this on my computer. It‚Äôs foggy outside and honestly I have had something on my mind for years since I was a lad back in 1977. The story I‚Äôm going to go into has troubled me for genuine decades and need advice to get over it. I‚Äôm 67 and my son told me to go in here and ask you people on this app what to do. Some notes before hand, I‚Äôve been to therapy thanks to my son‚Äôs wife convincing me to go. I am on medication to sleep at night but it barely works. I am not going here for questions but for simple advice if anyone has any. The story may be long so I don‚Äôt expect a ton of you to answer, but to yall that do I am truly in your favor.

The year was 1977. I had just recently turned about 19 years old and I was working at a piggly wiggly in Seattle. I remember my mentality then. I was young and didn‚Äôt care. I had long hair trying to be like my favorite band members. At the time I was dating this girl and had just gotten done writing a Christmas card. I was called into the office by my boss. I don‚Äôt remember his name but he was younger and scruffy. Pretty sure he went through a rough divorce and would drink all the time and just watch his cameras which at the time were expensive and he barely afford to keeep the store going due to the high expense he took to make sure theft wasn‚Äôt plausible. He told me I needed to head up to a different location if I was comfortable enough as they didn‚Äôt have a closer. I asked him how long I‚Äôd be staying and he said till 12 and I could go. So that‚Äôs what I did. I clocked out and hoped in my car. It was an old Volkswagen beatle. My mom‚Äôs car. If I knew the value they‚Äôd have now I would‚Äôve kept it. But I drove 1 and a half hours maybe more I don‚Äôt remember. The whole time I question why I did it. It was cold and the beatle didn‚Äôt have heat. I was driving for over an hour and didn‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd have the strength to go home. I arrived and it was dead. Not a car in sight. I remember only two cars in the lot. I got out, smoked a cigarette and headed in. I remember it was a small, and I mean very small store. Only two offices at most and it was cramped with shelves. It was nice however and I walked to the back. I found a man in a black button up and he introduced me as the manager. He was about my age with no hair. He told me he had to leave and gave me the run down.

I watched him drive away and sat at the register messing with a stapler or something like that. That was until three men walked up and placed lighter fluid, some wood planks, and a tarp on the register. The register was different from my location and it took some time to figure out. They asked me ‚Äúhow long you here bud‚Äù I remember it cold as day. They all looked middle aged and I gave them a dirty look. They laughed and made fun of me saying they couldn‚Äôt imagine being here this time of night saying it was a wuss job. I rung them up and they left. I just sat there messing around and even slid a few ciggerate boxes in my pocket of my leather coat. After awhile passed I closed the store and went to the front to smoke. I remember the smell of burning and I had sat there wondering why my cigarettes stunk so damn bad. Eventually I realized, it wasn‚Äôt my cigarettes. I looked yo and through the night could see smoke passing from behind the store. I started to question following it and at the time, I didn‚Äôt care. It was the winter of 77 and there wasn‚Äôt anything to do. You‚Äôd have to be alive at that time to understand true real boredom. I ended up saying fuck it audibly and threw my smokes down. I walked to the back and noticed it went into the woods quite a ways. I questioned once again if I should and sat there staring at the dark woods that surrounded the store. I went to my car and grabbed the flashlight behind the front seat. It barely had charge from the campouts me and my buddies had and it was cold to grip but once again I regret every second leading up to this. 

I started walking into the woods and pulled out the weed in my pocket. At the time my dad left and was with his new wife. My mom was a drunk who‚Äôd hook up with anyone she could sometimes women which at this time keep in mind was not seen as normal. So I took this as an opportunity to smoke some more. I walked through the woods tracing this smoke as I smoked myself. I kept stepping through the branches until the point where I couldn‚Äôt even see the store. It got to the point where I finally reached a point where I could see the source of this fire. Through the trees I remember seeing a big fire and I mean huge. At first I thought it was a bonfire and I got excited. I kept walking until I realized something was off. The people around this fire were all sitting around it, but not normally. It was kind of like a cross cross you lean back in the preschool. It was weird. They were sitting hands in lap not moving staring at it. I sat there questioning what the hell I was looking at and eventually thought it would be smart to lay down and not be out in the open. So that‚Äôs what I did. I stared and watched and eventually they all stood up and stared. I was wondering truly what the hell I was looking at. At the time, cult like movies weren‚Äôt allowed so I‚Äôd never seen something like this. Later down the road my son showed me a demonic like film where something similar happened on Netflicks. It was weird. I put my ciggerate out and watched. I ended up just sitting against a tree and continued being mesmerized by the people and the fires. The people were wearing black coats and pants. Most of them seemed to be men with short cut hair, the others were women in black dresses with very long kept hair. I remember sitting there amazed. I wish I had a camera to take a picture. It was just so, weird. I ended up almost dozing asleep until the people began singing. They started walking around the fire in a single file line and chanting. At this point the fear finally set in. For some reason once the chants started I visibly remember being unsettled. The whole I don‚Äôt care mindset faded and a feeling of uncertainty and fear washed over me. I ended up slowly creeping down. I was about 150 feet away I assumed. I remember I should just walk away but I sat there ducked down still mesmerized until all of a sudden, everything stopped. 

The people stopped chanting. They stopped moving. They stood there and just all turned in the direction of the woods opposite of mine. Then I heard screaming. I remember a man in a hood like those old executioners that are in the older times was dragging someone bound. I couldn‚Äôt get a clear image nor can I really remember what happened or what it looked like in grave detail. All I remember was they without a doubt slid something past his throat and chucked him in the bonfire. At this point I was done. I immediately began to stand up and bolt out of the woods. And I mean bolt. I actually left my flashlight in those woods when I got up. I just flew and took off. I remember I led eventually hit the store and ran to the front and got into my car. It took a second to start, and I sped off extremely fast. 

As I drove everything bothered me. I thought every car was following me. I thought every second someone was gonna pounce on me or followed me home. When I arrived back home I went inside and greeted my mother. She was in the couch eating ice cream. She said I looked dirty and disheveled and asked why I was home so late. I told her it was a busy day and went to sleep. I never told her. To the day she died. Never told my dad or friends, nothing. I kept my mouth shut. For days it was on my mind but I drank to remove the thoughts. Even having sex with my then girlfriend wouldn‚Äôt help. I was truly scared. I sat and drank wondering if I should go to the police or go back and find out. But after I believed 6 months passed, I wouldn‚Äôt begin to move on. 

Years have passed and I still think of it often. I remember at the age of 34 once it all became a distant memory just burned into my head needing to be uncovered it would. I went on a trip back up to my home town with my wife and two kids. I have two sons both at the time were 9 and 11. We drove my truck up there and I remember my wife, Marigold, nagging me to tell her and the kids stories about growing up where we were headed. I told them it was beautiful but a lot had changed. The kids were excited as so was I. As time passed of me telling these stories, suddenly the night in those woods popped up once again. The true fear I felt came back. I remember my wife in the passenger seat had asked why was I so worried. I told her I was fine and there wasn‚Äôt anything to worry about. Eventually we‚Äôd arrive and we‚Äôd go into the woods and set up our tents by this nice riverside. I‚Äôd assume it was somewhere around Lake Union. Eventually I‚Äôd end up going for a walk just me and the kids as my wife talked with other campers. As night grew I told the kids the story but a bit more child friendly. I told them I had barely survived and escaped the weird cultist. Just to make it more adventure like. They loved it but looked pretty scared. Of course they told me stories of their own and I pretended to be In fear. I can‚Äôt remember why but later in this trip I‚Äôd track down that store. I remember that one night in the tent I came up with the excuse with my family to head in the direction of that store where behind it all this happened. I was an idiot. My wife didn‚Äôt want to but she also wanted coffee or something along those lines and agreed relunctenly. I‚Äôd end up heading there to make a snack ‚Äúpit stop‚Äù or something along those lines. I pulled up the truck in the exact same spot I parked my beatle all those years ago. I told the kids and wife to stay put and id head in. I headed in and got snacks. The store was also it the exact same. Same register too. Only things that changed were the foods as that was over decades ago and companies change logos. Sadly it wasn‚Äôt a piggly wiggly anymore but it was still in a cute was nostalgic. I bought my wife‚Äôs coffee and the kids some gummies or something I don‚Äôt quite remember. I paid and walked out towards the truck and gave them their food. I got in, and right as I was gonning to turn that key, I knew I needed to go back into those woods. For my sanity. So I told them ‚Äúhey I saw a buck!‚Äù And charged out the truck went to the back and grabbed my gun. My son opened the door and went with me. My other son and wife stayed in the truck. I looked back and told him to stay, but it was obvious the only way id get him to stay would mean to say the truth and at this time my wife and really no one ever knew. So, we walked into those woods. We traveled through the sticks. The forest was well, a forest. Didn‚Äôt quite know where I was going I just went straight and took the turns I somewhat remembered. my son had asked where the buck was and if we could go back and I remember being very blunt and said to shush. After what felt like an eternity, I saw it. The clearing. A wave of guilt and fear hit me the second I realized what I was looking at. I was scared. But I proceeded forward and would regret this all the same. I stopped and stood in that same area where I did those years ago. I then took a deep breath and continued. I walked down and what I saw would only make it worse. I saw a huge fire or burn area. And it was still ashy. That‚Äôs right, still ashy. Like a fire was lit prior in the week. I just kept moving and walked around it. The remains of burned wood and books and papers. Thankfully no bodies like what I was looking for. After this I thought, maybe what I saw was wrong as if it was some big sacrificial pit wouldn‚Äôt there be bodies left? Either way after a minute i reclaimed my thoughts and decided to head back to the truck and regretted going into the woods all the same. 

My wife was sitting in the back seat of my truck cradling my son as a man in a black denim coat and black slacks was obviously knocking on the window trying to get there attention. I ended up calling him over. I don‚Äôt exactly remember how the conversation went but I ended up yelling at him to leave and he told me to stay the fuck away from there. I asked him who he thought he was and I threw him on the truck and slammed him into the fender. I was so firey back then. Miss those days. He ended up saying that I was asking for shit to happen and if I was a man id get in the truck and leave. I threw him off and got in the truck and drove off. At the time they were unrelated but as time has passed I still wonder if what had happened was possibly something more sinister. I told my wife. Eventually I would tell my kids in a night where I couldn‚Äôt sleep. My son‚Äôs wife, my daughter in law, Ashleigh would consider therapy. The idea of it didn‚Äôt sound good but I mustered up and went. I‚Äôve been put on pills and medications to sleep. I‚Äôve been restless all the same. I still wonder what the hell happened but try to move on with my life. That was over 40 years ago. I still recall the incident and think about the shoppers, the man at the truck, the fire. Was all this connected or was the man who was at my truck trying to rob or worse to my family. Maybe the shoppers were totally unrelated to the fire and what I saw wasn‚Äôt anything I thought or think it was. I‚Äôm still to this day, no sure. This has plagued my mind for years. I still wish maybe I said something. Went to the cops or awfully enought stayed and watched more so id be able to get some understanding.

Joshua Tree Coffee ‚Äì A letdown. Poorly made espresso drinks and burnt taste‚Äîskip it. I am no pro barista but watching them prep their coffee was sloppy. Not dosing or tamping properly‚Ä¶

Campbell Hill Bakery ‚Äì Amazing bread and pastries. Despite being listed as ‚Äúpermanently closed,‚Äù it was open and stocked with great lunch and dinner options like pizza, mac & cheese, and soups.

1ilisvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1ilisvq/highlights/,Highlights,"In the first dream, I was looking into a fridge. Finding my pistachio coffee mate creamer. I drank it and sat down next to some old classmates, seeing the one from posts I have made on here. In the dream after this, I was in a room. With people I didn't know. I ran into Demri Parrott, but it didn't look like her. The girl was a redhead. I had braided hair, taking selfies. And so did she, I noticed. We took selfies together, then I sat down in the liminal place I was in. Looking across to see an actor from the show house, who was apparently here. This led into the next dream, where I was in a victorian house. The dream had turned uncomfortable, as I was running away from the ghost of a little girl with a guy. She died from poisoning I think, and tried to get us to drink something. That was clearly poisoned. With a group of people, I was being led into a room. A old man with light brown, long hair held a bunch of people in the same room. Wanting us all to die the same way he did, which was by fire as he had a furnace/heater behind a couch that was in the room. I held onto a guy with a brown-tan flannel, pulling him against me. A couple of guys were next to me. I told a older guy to come over, making him stand behind me. The quiet/shy kid from my school, who was the only other person who was artistic and quiet like me was there, standing beside him. I reached out to the hold the guy's hand, so he wouldn't feel alone. We gave blood, sitting down on a couch in the corner of the room. Holding up a knife, the guy next to me said we had to give blood. I got nervous, but held out my arm, to which he used a razor to cut it. Unless it was actually a piece of glass. I'm positive it was a razor. I felt the pain, as he cut into me, in a tiny cut on my wrist. On the edge and to the right. It bled pretty hard, as blobs of it came out. It kept coming out, as it wouldn't stop bleeding for some reason. He poured all our blood into a little black cup. That looked like the taco bell dipping sauce cup. The old man offered snacks to us, which were edwardian and not processed. I thought to myself. As he had offered cheerios, toffee, caramel squares, saltine crackers. Those are the ones I remember, having images of them go through my mind. The other group of people in the room filled a container of blood, in a little black cup. Trying to get out of the building, I found myself walking through the place. The guy that was with me mentioned 'tales from the darkside' as I looked infront of me to see a vhs copy of it, of the movie, in two tapes. The shelf I was looking at was full of vhs tapes. I walked past the liminal spaces that were full of toys, with open flooring. A old lady, boomer aged that was there, directed me away towards the view ahead as newcomers, a group of young kids were crying out under the floor. Where I once was, in the room everyone was inside of. That would mean I was on the upper floor. Which looked more like a office building, and not like a house. It was all still vintage, and like a school/daycare. As I walked past a room for kids. As they played vhs stuff of things they owned. It was like a bedroom. There was a schedule engraved on the outside of the door, etched in glass. *'Caillou'* was written on it, with *'Sleep'* under it. Other stuff was written there, above and below those words. With the hours to show those media. Those are the only ones I remember. It all seemed like a daycare for ghosts. The guy came back up to me, with a new haircut; as time had passed. Time was different here. It had been a while. He told me he had spent a lifetime looking for me. I recognized him as one of the guy's I went to school with. I left the place with him, going outside where there was tents full of stuff. It was still very nightmarish. I grabbed a sword and started flying. Hovering off the ground as males underneath me didn't know what to do. They were probably trying to hold me down to the ground, from the gravitational pull. And or take the sword away. Machines of loving grace was playing. It was either bikini atoll, or butterfly wings. Inbetween other gen-x music. I thought about what I'd be like if I was born xennial, wondering if I'd have female friends. In the yard I was in, I saw the backside of my house behind me. Light green, pastel, like sage. The back of the house was cream/mustard in color, like the room I was in. At least edwardian age. It was all very early 1900s, but the house was definitely 1890s style/age. I could just go run inside my house if I wanted to, but I wanted to save the group of guys I was with. The grass was a vibrant green, so it must've been spring. I woke up not too long after this.

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1ilinee,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ilinee/match_me_a_dog/,Match me a dog!,"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
   * Yes, it will be my first solo cared-for dog. I grew up with a lab and then a CKC Spaniel, but I've never had one of my own. 
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a¬†[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
   * I would prefer to rescue a dog, but I would go through a reputable breeder if need be. 
3. Describe your ideal dog.
   * Loves to cuddle, loves the odd adventure, good for a couple walks a day, but doesn't have a lot of energy. I am a teacher and live in an apartment, so I do not have a lot of space or time to do more. I do not want a puppy, as I cannot dedicate time to basic training. 
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
   * I love large breeds, but my apartment has a size and breed restriction- no pitty mixes or anything larger than 22"" tall at the shoulder. I don't connect with small breeds very well, I find they can be yappy, high energy, and not as friendly as a big loveable oaf breed. 
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
   * Sit, stay, heel, recall. The basics for safety, but no need for tricks. I want a companion and to keep them safe. 
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
   * Nope!

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
   * I am a teacher, so I commute to my school each day. I am an early riser, so I can take them for a walk in the morning and have some cuddles on the couch with coffee and the news. But they would be alone until I get home each night. I'd have evenings, weekends, non-school days, and the long breaks to spend as much time as possible with my doggo. 
2. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
   * I live in a great city with plenty of parks including on and off-leash dog parks. There is also a dog run at my apartment building. At least twice daily walks on school days, and more exercise when I am not at work. 
3. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
   * I don't mind the daily grooming- nails, ears, eyes, brushing; but I do not want anything extensive. I'd take them to a proper groomer for trims, baths, etc. 

**Personal Preferences**

1. What size dog are you looking for?
   * Medium, with the attitude of a large dog. 
2. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
   * I have always said the droolier the better, but within reason, haha. Some shedding is fine, just not routinely blowing it's coat. Ideally no barking indoors, and no barking on leash. 
3. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
   * Not important. I don't live near any unfenced areas that I would trust to let my dog off-leash. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
   * Love cuddles, but I don't like the dog to be needy. If I get up, I want them to feel comfortable to not need to follow me. 
2. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager to please?
   * I respect independence, but I don't want to be ignored. 
3. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
   * Friendly is important, but I live alone and can understand some apprehension to people at the door. I do not have a yard to worry about. 
4. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
   * No, I can accept some guarded behaviour, but I don't want aggression. 
5. Are there any other behaviours you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?
   * Yappy, clingy, chewing my things. 

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
   * School days for school hours, otherwise it would come with me for long stints or I'd have someone stay with them. 
2. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
   * Just me.
3. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
   * I am looking at getting a cat, but that's it. 
4. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
   * No, I have no children. I work with kids and have nieces/nephews, but the dog doesn't need to be around them. 
5. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
   * I rent; there are restrictions on height and breed. 
6. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
   * Canada, Alberta, no laws in my city, but the apartment doesn't allow Pitbulls or pit-mixes. 
7. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
   * Summer- mid 20's, Winter- negative 10-20

Drinks alcohol on weekend  
Not a smoker  
Does not use recreational drugs

  
I am a 35 year old man with no history of seizures. I have no family history of epilepsy, to my knowledge. I had a seizure, out of the blue, last week, whilst in a supermarker, which resulted in a fracture to my scapula.

In the hospital afterwards I had a head CT scan, a heart ECG, and blood tests, none of which prompted any concern from the doctor.

I have been going round in circles worrying about what could have caused this and have listed several factors that may or may not be relevant. I am keen, really, to get a sense of whether this was likely provoked and, if so, by what.

1. I drank a lot of caffeine on the day of the seizure (4 cups of coffee and one cup of tea)- this is on the upper end of typical for me  
2. I consumed a lot of sugar on the day of the seizure (two packets of sweets and two sugars in my tea)   
3. I had a large breakfast but skipped lunch and had the seizure at 4.30 pm   
4. I typically drink alcohol on weekends. I had abstained from alcohol entirely through January (dry january!), then drank on the first weekend of February. I had 8 pints of beer on the Saturday and 2 pints of cider on the Sunday. I did not drink on the monday or Tuesday. I had the seizure on Tuesday afternoon.   
5. I took ginseng supplements for the first time, the night before and the morning of the day I had the seizure. I took 150mg the night before and 150mg the morning of, so consumed around 300mg in the 24 hours leading up to the seizure. I did notice when I took this the night before that I felt quite hot and mildly feverish for a small amount of time but thought nothing more of it.  
6. I had been taking sildenafil for erectile dysfunction, sporadically, for around 6 months leading up to the seizure, including 75mg on the night before the seizure. 7. I was not severely sleep deprived. 8. I have ulcerative colitis which has been in remission for 18+ months and a blood test the week before my seizure showed no concerning inflammation.   
9. I have had no recent concussions or head injuries.   
10. A blood test, coincidentally carried out the week before the seizure showed that nothing was concerning but that my calcium levels were ever so slightly above the reference range (I take calcium+vitamin d supplements on prescription following cortico-steroid induced osteopenia). My testosterone was above the reference range, my albumin was also slightly high.   
11. I have previously had a head MRI, about 18 months ago, which showed nothing concerning, beside nasal polyps.   
12. I take 2.4 g of mesalamine a day for colitis and have taken this dose or higher for the past 7 years.   
13. I take 40mg of adalimumab every two weeks and have done for the past 18+ months. 14. I have previously had several courses of prednisolone treatment for colitis flares, but had my last one 18+ months ago.

If there is anything that stands out from this list as potentially triggering a seizure I would be very grateful to hear it. My first hunch is ginseng, coupled with caffeine, given that this was the only 'out of the ordinary' thing I consumed leading up to the seizure, but I am glad to hear any suggestions.

I have a referral to a neurologist, which will occur at some point in the next 10 days, so I am really just looking for a theory to answer my anxiety about a possible relapse in the meantime!",3,1739118661.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I grew up watching my parents relying on their parents for money. My mom used to work but she changed jobs like socks while my dad worked privately. In my teenage years my dad started working as a maintenance team with a low pay and my mom started cleaning and making deserts privately so it was not like she had a job all year around. When we were tight on money, my sister and I had to be all loving to our grandma just so that she sends us money.

I only bought stuff when I was on a summer vacation at my grandma's and I started going there when I was like 8. When I was at home, I'd have to buy shoes for 8$ that I'd outgrow fast and I used to wear small shoes for a while. I still wear stuff from when I was 12 or 13. I used to ask my dad for a thrifted book which cost like 4$ and he said we don't have money.

That way I used to get an idea that I can't have anything for myself. Minimize my wishes and desires. I used to feel extremely overwhelmed when I'd have to buy a facial cleanser or a roll on or a snack because I had a feeling I couldn't ask for it as we were already tight on money.

Now that I have a job but no degree, I feel that I can be let go at any moment. I have to get up at 4 am, travel for 1h, start working at 6 am, give my best physically and mentally, I go home after being 10h away from home completely exhausted that I can only do basic hygiene, eat and go to bed. I bite my tongue a lot because I'd get destroyed if I didn't have an income, it would be my biggest fear coming true. I used to fall into such intense depressive episode that I couldn't wake up for 16-18h even if I had 15 alarms and if someone woke me up so my mom gets up at 3 am just in case I don't wake up. She makes me coffee. She always wants to wash my clothes, iron them, clean my room, fix me a meal, anything literally but I get angry because I can't accept that I'm spoiled.

The worst thing is, I don't know how to pay bills, I don't have a license, I have no idea how the world works. Yes, I lived alone when I since I was 15 til I was 18 but I didn't pay bills, I just made meals, cleaned, studied, went to dentist/doctor etc. so I only took care of myself. That's now engraved in me and I can't clean after other people or make meals for people.

Even tho I have money now, I want to make up for everything that I didn't have. Buying clothes, make up, keychains, paint for my room, beauty/hygiene products, dyeing my hair, TV, cigarettes, snacks, drinks, jewelry, getting tattoos and piercings, that's literally all I do. I don't pay for bills nor anything else but I do give my parents money when they're short for the month as my mom doesn't work. I feel very spoiled because my dad drives me everywhere and realistically I can start lessons if I save money for let's say ~6 months but I'm so unstable and dissociated so I believe I'd just fail and spend money on nothing. That's why I want to get the most I can before I start driving lessons in case I keep failing.

I don't even want to get married and have kids because I find the money responsibility and getting rid of my needs and wishes extremely fear inducing. I can't minimize my needs anymore because I can't control them. People around me encourage it because I'm still young but I feel so guilty that I swear I feel like I'm dying sometimes.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm in the US. I've had this Eureka Atom 60 for about 7 years (and a Lelit grinder for 7 years before that). I liked that it was quiet and beefy, but it's starting to have intermittent issues. Based on some of the lead times I'm reading about, I don't want to wait until this one fails completely to order a new one.

I usually make 4 drinks per day, in two pairs of two. Lattes and Cappuccinos. I think I'd prefer single dose because if I have a hopper, I'm going use it (probably causing beans to stale early). Plus, even when dialed in, the timed dose was variable enough that I'm always re-weighing, then taking a little out, adding a little, etc. I'd prefer to weigh the whole beans first, them use a grinder I was confident had low retention.

I don't think I need to spend another $800-900. I'm probably not going to get fussy enough that I'm swapping or upgrading burrs. I just want a decent burr set off the bat, and I'll stick with it. 

95% of the time, I'm making espresso, but I do want to have a pour-over occasionally. Currently, I have to switch to my hand grinder because the little dial on the Atom would take FOREVER to move back and forth. And I'd for sure lose my espresso setting in the process.

I started ADHD meds last July, following my adult dx. 

Elvanse/ Vyvanse (one of the amphetamine family) made me horribly depressed, did nothing for the ADHD, and had a ton of nasty side effects like muscle and bone pain and weakness, plus intractable insomnia.

Concerta (an extended release methylphenidate) did bugger all positive, until I was put on a big enough dose to make a difference (54mg morning, 27mg lunchtime/ afternoon, at which point I had terrible side effects again.

Was switched randomly to Medikinet, another methylphenidate, because of Concerta shortages here last October, and thankfully Medikinet has been a lot more positive for me.

I got that URTI bug that‚Äôs doing the rounds (some people are calling it the ‚Äú100 day cough‚Äù), all over Christmas.

I wasn‚Äôt drinking a lot of herbal teas before that, but I drank pints and pints of mullein tea to get rid of the cough, which it did a great job of.

Since then, I‚Äôve been drinking more herbal tea than I did before, including continuing to drink mullein tea because I like it. 

My Medikinet, which had been working just fine for 3 months, we were just refining the daily dose and timings of those, seems to either not work at all, or sends me spiralling into paralysing anxiety instead. 

Before, I just had clean, clear-headed energy from my morning Medikinet.


Is there any relationship between my methylphenidate not working like it was, and me drinking mullein tea every day, or is this just a coincidence? 

Admittedly, I seem to have replaced all coffee with mullein tea, and have an infuser mug first thing in the morning, then at least one big pot of it a day, usually around tea-time, and sometimes extra infuser mugs of it during the day as well.

I have it with pieces of lemon, and set honey. 

I also reacted badly to chamomile tea recently, which I‚Äôve had tons of times before ADHD meds without any problems. 

Are my herbs and my methylphenidate meds rubbing each other up the wrong way? 

I asked this over on the herbalism sub, and so far, my question has only been downvoted, so asking here in case any UK ADHDers have experience of this possible interaction they can share.

Ah, the classic showdown between the Massachusetts Minutemen and the La Salle Explorers. It's like watching two history professors argue over who discovered America first. But let's dive into the numbers and see if we can predict which team will plant their flag in victory.

The Minutemen are slightly favored with odds around 1.87, while the Explorers are close behind at 1.95. This is basically a coin flip, but with slightly more math involved. Given that underdogs in basketball only win about 25% of the time, you'd think Massachusetts has the edge. But remember, this is college basketball, where the only thing more unpredictable than the games are the hairstyles.

The spread is hovering around 1.0 to 1.5 points depending on where you place your bets, which is basically the oddsmakers' way of saying, ""We have no idea either."" The total points line is set at 152.5, suggesting a high-scoring affair. So, if you like your basketball games like you like your coffee‚Äîfast-paced and jitter-inducing‚Äîthis one's for you.

Now, for the best bet: Given the tight odds and the unpredictable nature of college basketball, I‚Äôd lean towards taking the Over on the total points at 152.5. Both teams have shown they can light up the scoreboard, and let's face it, defense in college basketball is often as optional as attending a 9 AM lecture.

So, grab your popcorn, place your bets, and prepare for a game that could be as thrilling as a history lesson on caffeine. May the best team (or the one with the least turnovers) win!",1,1739118220.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Ever start your day feeling like you're already playing catch-up? Like you‚Äôre three coffees in, but your brain is still hitting snooze? Yeah, we've all been there. üí§ But what if I told you that a simple, purposeful morning routine could change everything? 

I promise, it‚Äôs not about waking up at 4 AM and running a marathon before breakfast. It's more about setting a tone that serves *you*! So, let‚Äôs dive into some game-changing habits that‚Äôll have you kicking stress out the window üöÄ:

1. **Start with Gratitude:**
   - Before you even roll out of bed, think of three things you‚Äôre grateful for. It could be your cozy blanket, your energetic pup, or even that blast of sunshine sneaking through your curtains. Trust me, it‚Äôs like a mood booster shot‚Äîno needle required!

2. **Hydrate Like a Boss:**
   - Seriously, coffee can wait. Grab a big glass of water and savor every sip. Your body will thank you. Plus, having a clear mind to map out the day beats caffeine jitters any time.

3. **Mindful Movement:**
   - No, you don‚Äôt have to hit the gym. Just get your body movin‚Äô. A quick yoga flow, a dance party for one, or even a stroll around the block. Pick your own adventure. üï∫üíÉ

4. **Plan Your Day (or Just Wing It!):**
   - Some of us thrive on ticking off to-do lists while others love the thrill of spontaneity. Spend a few moments sketching out your priorities or simply let the day surprise you. Find what makes you bloom!

5. **Morning Tunes or Silence Cruise:**
   - Music lovers, curate a playlist that lifts you up and gets those vibes rolling. Prefer a zen morning? Sit in silence with a cup of tea. Let the world start at a peaceful pace for you.

And let's not forget, **be kind to yourself.** Some mornings you'll nail it; other days will be a beautiful mess. Both are okay. üåà Celebrate small wins and laugh off the spills.

**üí† 2024 ‚Äì the year of the Grind. War mode, focus mode**  
  
2024 was difficult, hardcore, but productive.  
  
Difficult because it takes time to clarify things.  
  
Hardcore, because it‚Äôs actually painful to make changes, take hard decisions, and execute.  
  
Productive, because despite many challenges, important clarifying steps were made.  
  
But all of it was necessary. No other way around it.  
  
With these steps executed, the future looks stronger and brighter for MultiversX.  
  
But why?¬†

**üí† Where we are now ‚Äì Foundation set, Products unleashed**  
  
First, we‚Äôve killed the dead weight. Then doubled down on what worked.  
  
And the few bets we've made are now about to take off ‚Äì big time.  
  
xPortal, xMoney, xExchange, xLaunchpad -- are NOW all separate and independent projects, each of them set for significant growth.  
  
We‚Äôve mentioned this during our November townhall‚Äìnow, it‚Äôs a reality.  
  
Each of these projects will likely have their best year in 2025.  
  
But why, what role will they play?¬†

**üí† Growth, growth, growth**  
  
Each of these applications are‚Äîand will continue to be‚Äîan extraordinary avenue for MultiversX growth.  
  
xPortal: user growth.  
xMoney: payments growth.  
  
xExchange: liquidity, volumes, and community experimentation growth.  
xLaunchpad: startup incubator and product growth.  
  
They all grew inside the ecosystem. Now, they are ready to expand beyond it, tapping into new opportunities.  
  
New ecosystems, new users and eyeballs, new liquidity.  
  
Paradoxically, it‚Äôs when these projects become separate, independent, and self-sustaining that their growth will have the highest positive impact and spillover effect on MultiversX.  
  
Very interesting‚Äîbut how come?¬†

**üí† Powerful network effects drive value**  
  
On the one hand, this means separate entities, separate raises, separate pipelines, and no more selling pressure on EGLD.  
  
On the other hand, and far more important, MultiversX gets subtly and elegantly exposed to all new ecosystems, all new eyeballs, all new liquidity.  
  
Before you know it, the network effect of one big winner spills over to the next. And suddenly, you find yourself in completely new conversations, gaining new insights, securing new business deals, and unlocking unparalleled avenues for growth.  
  
All of it contributing to the value of MultiversX and EGLD.¬†

**üí† xPortal & xMoney ‚Äì It‚Äôs time to fly high**  
  
xPortal and xMoney are now in exceptional positions.  
  
They will soon conclude new funding rounds and announce big plans.  
  
The bigger the growth, the greater the odds of success for everything else.  
  
It might seem scary at first, but surprisingly, this is the strongest position‚Äîand biggest blessing‚Äîpossible.  
  
The one everyone secretly wished they had.¬†

**üí† Innovation takes time, but it opens a new world**  
  
This all took a lot of time. An insane amount of time.  
Much more than we all would have liked.  
  
But if you bring exceptional individuals together, align their goals, and give them enough time, you will eventually see wonders happen.  
  
Results compound, over and over, until perspectives shift from skeptical critique to a strong positive sentiment that becomes unstoppable.  
  
A spark. This is how momentum begins. How winning feels.  
  
And it‚Äôs about to ignite across the entire ecosystem.¬†

**üí† So how about MultiversX? What is the winning move for that?**  
  
Well, MultiversX is one of the most scalable and advanced blockchain networks in the world. It is live and open source TODAY.  
  
And in 2025, the big upgrade is coming.  
  
It will bring the biggest set of cumulative improvements since the mainnet launch.  
  
Putting MultiversX at the frontier of technological growth.  
  
But how?¬†

**üí† United States: The New Frontier**  
  
First, 2025 will be the year American growth accelerates. üá∫üá∏  
  
We are going all-in on America. No other place offers this kind of momentum, funding, regulatory advancements, government openness, and support that is conducive to our growth.  
  
This is America's Golden Age - the start of one of the biggest potential booms for the American economy‚Äîand we intend to be at the frontier of it.  
  
We have already begun this process, with many strategic meetings and discussions underway.  
  
More specifically, we are now actively working to appoint a new foundation president, heavily focused on the US, with the intention to have this finalized by the end of Q1/Q2 2025.¬†

**üí† Network Speed is coming, with sub-second finality**  
  
Second, 2025 will be the year network speed is elevated.  
  
For the past year, everything has been prepared, setting the ground for the biggest network upgrade in MultiversX‚Äôs history.  
  
From its inception, MultiversX had unparalleled bandwidth and scalability, thanks to its breakthrough sharding technology.  
  
Now, it's time to take the entire architecture to the next level with the most awaited and compelling network, UX and ecosystem improvement: sub-second finality.  
  
This will change the game, enabling even better user experience, more streamlined costs, and even higher bandwidth for the entire network.  
  
This big milestone is targeted for Q3 2025.¬†

**üí† Economic Upgrade, accelerating growth**  
  
Third, 2025 will be the year of a major new economic upgrade.  
  
For the past years, we‚Äôve been gathering a lot of research and feedback to refine and expand EGLD‚Äôs economics by embedding network growth at its core. The lessons we've learned have yielded several new ideas and insights, all of which will be consolidated into a new economics upgrade proposal.  
  
This upgrade will bring (a) stronger incentives for validators and stakers, (b) new liquidity flywheel incentives, (c) new builder season incentives, and (d) new marketing and business development incentives ‚Äì all aligned for a big-league play.  
  
If we want to truly play the American game, accelerate and grow the pie significantly, this will be a crucial milestone, bringing a renewed wave of growth on all key verticals.  
  
We aim to present a proposal and engage in community-wide discussions about the new phase of EGLD economics in Q2/Q3 2025. We are very much looking forward to your ideas and thoughts on this subject via the Agora.¬†

**üí† Funding the war chest**  
  
Fourth, 2025 will be the year of a strategic funding round.  
  
We have already begun conversations to secure the funding needed to achieve MultiversX‚Äôs American ambitions.  
  
To play in the big leagues‚Äîand win‚Äîwe need a big league war chest. There is no way around it. The US is the big leagues, the game is played completely differently.  
  
With this war chest, we will secure MultiversX‚Äôs position for the next 10 years, at the very epicenter of the new American technology era that is starting.  
  
This is targeted to happen during Q2/Q4 2025.¬†

**üí† Lightspeed Chains, more growth**  
  
Fifth, 2025 will be the year when interoperability is transformed.  
  
Let me state something surprising:  
  
LIGHTSPEED CHAINS WILL BE READY BY THE END OF Q1 (!)  
  
This alone is a billion dollar module. It is the simplest, fastest, L1 starter kit in the world. And now it also has a better temporary name :)¬†  
  
Builders from all over the world will be able to bring their applications to life on it.  
  
During 2025, there will be 1 Lightspeed Chain launch unveiled, connecting MultiversX with one of the biggest other blockchain networks in the world.  
  
With new incentives, and new growth avenues.  
  
This means new users, new devs, new liquidity, better alignment, and maximum leverage on the MultiversX technology that has been built, battle tested, and is live today.  
  
This launch is targeted for Q2/Q3.  
  
Lightspeed Chains will be effectively a 10x lever on MultiversX and EGLD, adding extraordinary new value flywheels to the entire ecosystem.¬†

**üí† Let an Ecosystem boom begin**  
  
Sixth, 2025 will be a year for the MultiversX ecosystem boom to begin.  
  
For the past years, many hardcore builders have been building great tools and products.  
  
This is the year they get their chance to shine, a chance to unlock new adoption pipelines, a chance to attract new liquidity into their ecosystems.  
  
Now, with a clearer north star for the network, it will be up to them to push boundaries and make the biggest contributions to expand and grow the pie‚Äîfor everyone.¬†

**üí† Faster ‚Äì separate products, more engines**  
  
Seventh, 2025 will be the year of the separate products boom.  
  
Every product and growth pipeline bootstrapped within MultiversX Labs and the MultiversX Foundation is about to start delivering new growth dividends, fueling ecosystem acceleration.  
  
For all these products, this is just the beginning.¬†

**üí† Network > Foundation > Company**  
  
Eight, 2025 is the year of the network.  
  
Not the labs, not the foundation, but the network. A network is more like a city or a country, rather than a company. A network doesn't have a CEO, doesn't have a CMO, doesn‚Äôt have a CTO. Neither does a city or a country.  
  
A network has a core ethos. It stands for something. Its parts are made of nodes‚Äîusers and citizens.  
  
The more motivated and aligned these nodes are, the more unstoppable the network becomes. We are all the CEOs, CMOs, CTOs of the network. We are all the contributors and doers in this network. Every effort of each node, users and citizens adds up, translating into an avalanche of momentum.  
  
High-agency, motivated, and aligned users.  
  
This is our true strength. This creates a megawave unlike anything seen before.¬†

**üí† A North Star ‚Äì Putting the puzzle pieces together**  
  
Now, how do we tie all this together?  
  
What is the focused North Star that sharpens these pieces into a roaring economic engine?  
  
The one that simplifies it, turning it into a meme-like, contagious, mind virus?  
  
Nine, 2025 will be the year we introduce \*Global Autonomous Markets\*.  
  
This is a crisp and evolving north star‚Äîfrom the outset our vision has been to build the very best blockchain infrastructure, with unparalleled performance, and pointing them to where they are needed most: open and decentralized markets and artificial intelligence.  
  
The world's settlement, coordination, and accountability layer‚Äîengineered for markets, AI, robotics, and other high-impact, rapidly evolving domains.  
  
In many ways, everything we have been building together over the past years has brought us to this point.  
  
We have created a blockchain that is technically ready to offer the levels of scalability, trust, decentralization needed to become a leader and provide the transparency and programmability needed for the field of Artificial Intelligence.  
  
This north star will provide a fresh focal point and mental model, shedding a new light on value creation, value accrual, and utility.  
  
Not just for today‚Äôs world, but for the years to come.¬†

**üí† Challenges, challenges, challenges**  
  
Does this mean it will be all fun and games?  
Does it mean it will be simple?  
Does it mean that everything will work out perfectly?  
  
Quite the opposite.  
  
It means things will be tough and challenging. Some things won‚Äôt work out. Some will take much more time than initially thought. It means everything will be imperfect, and we‚Äôll have obstacles thrown our direction every step of the way.  
  
The world doesn't owe us anything. And no one is coming to save us.  
  
Many times, it just feels like eating glass, and staring into the abyss.  
  
But. The only way up, is through the challenge.¬†

**üí† On winning - Unleashing the wave**  
  
Truth be told, learning some of these lessons has been difficult.  
  
I wish we had learned them faster. I wish we had seen and understood things sooner.  
  
But some things take time.  
  
Yet once the dots connect, a completely new perspective emerges.¬†

**üí† Concluding thoughts**  
  
(a) Together we have built a network and economy from zero to one billion. That alone is extremely rare and pretty insane. How do we take it to the first trillion?  
  
(b) As a builder, remember that extraordinary value creation takes time. Think of Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon or Apple. Building any of those took 10-20 years before they hit a decent compounding trajectory. Those were built by the most brilliant people in the world, and it took them 10-20 years. Stop and think about that. Until what year would you have pushed forward? At what year would you have given up?  
  
(c) As an investor, a minimal investment in any of those would have made you a wealthy multi millionaire. The question is: would you have had the resolute patience and emotional fortitude to see that value through? Would you have had the relentless stubbornness to focus on the bigger picture, even when markets made everyone around you lose their mind?¬†

**üí† Some answers, some more questions**  
  
The answer to question (a) lies in the path outlined above. I believe the megawave is right in front of us. Once we are ready, it will reveal itself fully.  
  
The answer to question (b) lies within. The only way to lose is to accept defeat.  
  
The answer to question (c) is more puzzling. You see, in hindsight everything looks like a simple, straight line. In reality, each of these companies was inches from dying, many many times. Each time, investors and contributors were tested and retested in many ways.  
  
How many survived? How many retained their composure?  
  
How many got to reap insane and outlandish rewards that were clearly possible?¬†

**üí† Very few. Surprisingly few. But why?**  
  
Perhaps because they were the ones ready to pay the price.  
To double down when it mattered most.  
To go to the ends of the earth‚Äìif that is what it took.  
  
To believe.  
To contribute.  
To stay together.¬†

Few survived. Some reshaped the world. Their impact is still felt in society today.  
  
This is our moment.  
Our choices and actions will echo for years to come.  
  
Let‚Äôs make them worth it.¬†

So how can you contribute today?  
  
First, if you can‚Äîbuild. As much as you can.  
  
Second, if you buy and stake EGLD you are an invaluable contributor.  
  
Third, spread the word. Write, simplify, share the message. Add your insights, refine and improve the process.  
  
These are the immediate actions that add up to massive impact.

/fin  
  
P.S. Note at all details about the US expansion, Network Upgrade, Economics & Funding Upgrade, Interoperability and Lightspeed Chains, Narrative and North Star, and the Ecosystem Boom are preliminary ideas.  
  
They are based on hundreds of discussions, feedback rounds with builders, the community, and friends.  
  
If we want growth, these seem some of the strongest steps forward.  
  
A separate post/thread and more thorough discussion will follow on each, during the next few weeks and months, once the ideas have reached a fully formed conclusion.  
  
For each, we will be eager to hear your thoughts and feedback on how things can be further improved.  
  
Harnessing these ideas ‚Äì discussing, improving, and executing them ‚Äì is how we change.¬†Will be doing a spaces conversation with DB on Friday evening.  
  
Hearing some of your thoughts, translating some of the ideas, and thinking through some of the important next steps.¬†

Partner (healthy) of 13 years keeps talking about health like it's optional. 

I'm coming down with a cold. They say, ""Just take zinc and drink water,"" and I should be able to fight it off. I explain my immune system is literally fighting itself, and shit for fighting off bugs. 

I try to talk about my eternal fatigue. They say I should drink more coffee--that's what they do when they're tired. I'm like, then I'm just wired and exhausted. Plus, caffeine isn't great for Crohns.

And so on.

It's just so hard for them to accept that some things are not a choice, and no matter what you do, you're still going to be sick and tired. Their optimism can't handle it. They think I'm being pessimistic or defeatest.

In case it's relevant, I AM doing what I can, taking biologics, prednisone, watching my food, etc. I just think caffeine or supplements aren't going to fix me.

Then I stumbled upon a few keyboard shortcuts that actually made me smile (who‚Äôd have thought pressing keys could be exciting?). Now I‚Äôm breezing through tasks *so* much faster, and I want to share some of that workflow magic.

Here are a few underrated shortcuts I swear by:

‚Ä¢ **Ctrl + Shift + T (or Cmd + Shift + T on Mac):** Accidentally closed a tab? This legendary shortcut reopens it in a flash. It‚Äôs saved me from frantic Google searches for a page I just had open literally five seconds ago.  
‚Ä¢ **Win + . (Windows) or Cmd + Control + Space (Mac):** Need an emoji to brighten up your emails or notes? This combo pulls up an emoji picker. Sometimes a tiny unicorn or happy face can do wonders for your mood.  
‚Ä¢ **Alt + Left Arrow (or Cmd + [ on Mac in many apps):** This is like the ‚Äúback‚Äù button for your computer. Went into a file or browser page and want to go back? Saves you from hunting for that arrow in the corner.  
‚Ä¢ **Windows + Shift + S** (specifically for Windows users): Perfect for quickly screenshotting specific areas. No more entire-screen screenies that you have to trim down later.  
‚Ä¢ **Ctrl + Shift + Esc:** Opens Task Manager instantly. Because sometimes, the best workflow hack is simply shutting down that pesky program that‚Äôs hogging your RAM.

What I love most is that once these become second nature, you start to feel unstoppable‚Äîlike you‚Äôve got a personal cheat code for life. Who doesn‚Äôt want to skip a few steps and finish early so you can actually enjoy a coffee break?

Lately, I‚Äôve been paying attention to how these small tricks add up, and it turns out *shaving off a few seconds here and there can really help you regain your focus.* Pretty soon, those spare seconds turn into minutes, and those minutes turn into‚Ä¶ well, you get the idea.

I‚Äôve definitely done a little happy dance when I nail a new shortcut seamlessly. Anyone else experience that weirdly satisfying moment when you remember which combination to press without even glancing at the keyboard?

It‚Äôs wild how a tiny tweak in your routine can give you a noticeable edge. Maybe it‚Äôs time we all start seeing the keyboard less like a piece of plastic and more like our trusty sidekick.

The plan? A cozy hotel stay in Clark, coffee shop hopping, lunch at Sage, and some quality hotel bonding. **Perfect weekend, right?**

But life said, **""LOL, plot twist!""** üö®

Just as we were about to leave on Saturday morning‚ÄîBOOM! Flat tire. No spare. No mechanic in sight. And just when I thought we‚Äôd have to cancel the trip, one of my friends did something‚Ä¶ *unexpected*.

She. Called. My. Ex.

Yep. **MY EX.**

For context, she was a great ex‚Äîkind, thoughtful, no bad blood. We broke up because of work, time, and that weird phase where we felt like we weren‚Äôt growing together. But despite that, she stayed close with my friends. Like‚Ä¶ *really* close.

So imagine my shock when the car rolls up, and there she is‚Äîglowing skin, toned shoulders, looking like she just stepped out of a K-drama. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm standing there like: **‚ÄúWait, what? Since when did my ex get even hotter?‚Äù** üò≥

And my friends? They didn‚Äôt just greet her. They ran to her like she was Jungkook in the flesh.I wanted to ask, *""Guys, whose RNR is this, really?""* but decided to let it go. No need to ruin the vibe.

Fast forward‚Äîwe reached Cafe BOM, and she turns to me with that familiar smile.*""Hi, kamusta ka?""* she says, before going in for a hug.

My brain? Static noise. üíÄMy mouth? *""I‚Äôm fine, ikaw?""* (then aggressively sips coffee to cope).

Surprisingly, the rest of the trip was great. No awkward tension, just good vibes. Until the real **plot twist** happened on the way home.

Our last stop was at a friend's house, where we had her mom‚Äôs home-cooked **sinigang and tilapia**‚Äîyung tipong lutong-bahay na sakto lang yung asim, lasang *comfort and nostalgia*. ü•π **Chef‚Äôs kiss.**

It was the perfect way to end the trip. Until my Grab plans were canceled... by her.

*""I‚Äôll take you home. It‚Äôs on my way,""* she said, like it was no big deal.

First three minutes? Awkward silence. Even the aircon was louder than us. But then a random convo with the village guard broke the ice, and suddenly, we were catching up.

Talking. Teasing. Laughing.

And as we reached my house, a small part of me actually wished for EDSA-level traffic, just to stretch the moment.

Then she hit me with: **""Bitin ako. Let‚Äôs hang out again?""**

I told her I was visiting my mom in Cavite on Friday. She said, **""Okay, can I pick you up? Let‚Äôs have lunch in Tagaytay?""**

I‚Äî**WHAT?** üò≥

Before my brain could process, my mouth went: *""Sige, pero Saturday?""*

And now, I have a‚Ä¶ uh, *friendly* lunch with my ex on Saturday.

So‚Ä¶ **does this still count as a Valentine‚Äôs date?** üòÇ

# Moral of the story?

Life has a funny way of bringing people back‚Äîsometimes for closure, sometimes for friendship, and sometimes‚Ä¶ maybe for a second chance. Who knows?
